"event","But also I've suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of loss regarding HP fandom. I'm not in it anymore, haven't been for at least half a decade, but I never thought I'd see the day where I couldn't get in touch with fabulous people I met during my time in it. Emails bouncing and whatnot. 

If any of you on my friends list come across this post one day in your future please, please drop me a comment. I will always do my best to keep this account active (as you can see from by the gap between this post and the last). It's a piece of my history, a piece that I'm not necessarily ashamed of.

I'm on facebook and tumblr ( http://www.tumblr.com/blog/alittlestardustcaught). Look me up, guys. I'd love to reconnect with you special people again.

"event","I have finished reading the 7th Harry Potter book and I will never read another new one again. And it hurts so badly. It was so... perfect. No book has made me go through the rollercoaster of emotions like this one did. I only finished reading twenty miutes ago and came straight to LJ. Although I haven't updated in more than a year, I read my friends list every time I came online, just to check up on you guys. I started this LJ because of Harry Potter fandom and it is fitting that I leave it as I have left the last Harry Potter book and hence, my childhood.

I probably won't update again. But I will continue to look at my friends list. This is my real goodbye. Thank you for all coming on this rare, once in a life time journey with me that has lasted years. I was a girl when I entered the HP universe and fandom and I'm now a woman, who has acheived much in my short amount of time. 

If you still want to keep in contact, I'm a regular on Facebook. Email me and I'll give you my real name if you have an account there.

Thanks guys. For everything."

Fractured toe. Oweeee and also very annoyed. No work or graduation performance rehearsals for me. 

Trust me to get so enthused I break something.

But no work today is good because it allows me to watch Doctor Who tonight... gearing myself up to wet my pants from fright. I also have to gear myself up to make the very painful walk to Boots to acquire some Ibupofen."

My assessments are over. This term is nearly over. This bitch from hell, scratch my eyes out, ears bleeding term. Thank fuck.

But I have done things. I have started going to the cinema on my own, found RL Potter friends, met famous people and made leaps and bounds in my dance training. I just haven't been posting about them.

I'm not going to miss college. I leave in July and I <i>know</i> I'm not going to look back on these years with fondness. I'll acknowledge they've been character building and made me a better dancer and given me a degree from a reputable institution but to be quite honest the college and everyone in it can go take a running jump because I've <i>paid</i> for those things I've just listed.

God, I'm boring myself.

In other news, just last week I met John Major, the Monarchy of Denmark, Jeremy Irons and Farmer Hoggett from Babe. :)

And yes I've seen the Potter film. Extremely impressed but why, oh, why did I cry at a Potter film? Embarrassing, no?"

4. I want Katie Leung's dress.

I have been too lazy to get to an internet cafe (a three minute walk from me) to converse with you lot. Or even wax lyrical about my holiday in Monaco. Which I must do.

Excuse for the past four weeks... riveted to THE ASHES, BABY! About bloody time for the men's AND women's team. Don't forget the women's team. They've been without longer, haven't they? Since the sixties? Or did I hear wrong?

However, I have been doing class at half eight in the morning for the past week before college starts in two weeks. Am bleary eyed.

Going now as my bladder is full to bursting after drinking about two pints of coffee.

And to sign this post off with at least one regard to other people: I know it's late but I hope everyone on lj who got mixed up in Hurricane Katrina is ok. I don't really know what else to say or do about this as I don't want to put my foot in it. My thoughts are with you."

<lj-cut text= ""Yikes."">

After I finished the chapter on Dumbledore's death I think I heard my heart crack a little. If I remember correctly after OotP came out I said ""I love Snape and want to have his babies.""

Throughout today, I was still feeling a little bit sick about Snape's betrayal even after rationalising the that part of the plot. Really, I do have my head screwed on and I can agree that Snape and Dumbledore might have had a plan for emergencies, but my body took over and I couldn't stop feeling sick.

Loved the book though. So much better than OotP which I didn't think was awful.

</lj-cut>

Will try and join in with conversations about HBP but time is limited as I'm back in London tomorrow and starting work.

"event","Okay, it's half nine PM and I've finally been able to get to an internet cafe (the only ""shops"" in London that are currently open).

Yes, I'm fine, and yes, I managed to get caught up in it. I've spoken to my mum and dad quite a lot so I feel I can share. Here's the story.

Some of you may not know that my route to school is through Russell Square park and along the road in which the bus was destroyed. My college is thirty seconds from Kings Cross and the bus carnage, that's why I was using that road.

And of course I was on way to college at ten to ten this morning instead of the usual eight o'clock as I break up from college tomorrow.

I heard the sound of the blast when walking through Russell Square park, I was still walking along the road towards it a minute later as police had not arrived yet. I got within two hundred metres of the bus before being stopped by a line of police that had arrived from the blast in Russell Square. I saw bodies, blood on the white stone walls of buildings and of course a bus without it's roof but amazingly still with its seats intact. It smelt dirty and hot.

I froze taking in the scene before me and the next thing I knew a policeman had his arm around my shoulders while leading me to sit down on the kerb of a pavement further away. He said he'd come back later to check on me but I left after 30 seconds. He had things he had to get on with, he didn't need me getting in the way.

I still tried to get to college by most roads were cordoned of at that point and I was just being pushed further and further west. Thousand of people were all around me. Calm, silent people just walking. However nearly everyone had a mobile to their ear but weren't talking. I tried to ring my mum; I was cut off. I tried to ring my dad; I was cut off. Tried everyone. Network overload.

At this point I'm nearby Paddington trying to look for a payphone with a reasonably sized queue. An hour later I ended up finding one near Tottenham Court Road. I get hold of my dad; who starts crying. I get hold of my mum; who starts crying. Very shocking as my parents aren't the crying kind of people really.

I go back to my hostel, switch on the TV and suddenly burst into tears. I was angry, so, so, angry. I went back out, got a large latte and walked all over London. I walked to Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. I walked for about 3 hours. No cars, no taxis, no buses. Just a lot of silent people. I've never seen London look so much like a ghost town. I've also been taking a lot of calls from friends and family so it's been a pretty busy day. I'm emotionally and physically drained. But I'm fine. It would have been a different story if I'd literally left my hostel five minutes earlier.

The people of London amazed me. I always thought that when an attack happened (and I always thought of 'when' not 'if') it would be alot of crazed individuals screaming their heads off. The complete opposite happens. I've heard of people criticizing the British 'stiff upper lip' before. But in this case it helped everything run along smoothly. That stiff upper lip was resilience. 

If anyone on the web has lost someone or has a love one in hospital due to these attacks, I'm thinking of you."

Got my marks for the technique assessments and again got Firsts in three of the four marks I received. The one I didn't get a First in I am appealing against. Not because I didn't get a First but because it is just ridiculously low. 57%. That's scraping the barrel at a 2:2. That mark was not based on <I>my</I> dancing. So I've made an appointment to see my tutor and the Director.

This means I miss the release of HBP. This sucks as I ordered it in January thinking I'll be there on the day and it's the day after my birthday yada yada yada.

But honestly when it comes down to it I'd chose the holiday over the book because I bloody well <i>deserve</i> this holiday. I've been working my little cotton socks off this year at college and have been working at the theatre more hours per week than anybody else I know at college.

Nothing else interesting. Dance is going well apart from The Injury From Hell but what can you do, eh?

C'est la vie.

Won't be updating too much around the summer holidays either because I've decided to stay in London and work, work, work.

Look at me all grown up.

(Oh, and just to change the subject, if anybody wants to read one of the best books ever [in my opinion, which is very harsh when it comes to books] pick up 'Five People You Meet in Heaven' by Mitch Albom. It was the most beautiful book I've every read. And 'The Crimson Petal and The White' by Michel Faber was pretty decent too.)"

Went for a walk about 10 yesterday morning and I was walking up Whitehall and saw all these people standing on the traffic islands.

""Stupid tourists"" I thought, as I needed room on one of these islands to cross the road.

Got to an island and peered around the throng of people gathered there and saw a big brass band coming out of the Changing of the Guards place followed by hundreds of veterans in green berets.

It was a VE day march.

I followed them all the way up to the Mall and got a fantastic place by one of the barriers and three policeman in black uniform and helmet.

As they passed people in the mall, people started clapping and I just burst out crying. Luckily I had sunglasses in my bag so I put those on. 

I didn't stop crying for 45 minutes until the end of the ceremony.

I didn't expect to cry, especially as I was on my own in public, but I'm glad I did because it made my day. Marches like this just get to me. Particularly because of the music. It's the same reason I got emotional at the Queen Mother's funeral.

"event","Pope John Paul II is dead. 

Religion has been a popular topic of discussion across our dinner table this week. Only on Thursday my Mum and I were talking for over an hour about what we believe (she's very spiritual about her religion, doesn't believe what the bible says but is still a Christian and I... can't, I suppose, believe in anything). I had the same discussion with my 17 year old, and rather Kevin-esque, brother yesterday.

I don't agree with the Roman Catholic faith as it is and I found the late Pope to have very simple views that just do not work in todays modern age of promiscuity and disease. 

But I understand his death is an important event. I may not feel anything rather than a detached interest but the historian in me doffs its cap at the passing of the pontiff. Because I'm here and I'm witnessing and what else can a non-believer do?"

Yes, I'm home.

Had to go all the way to Waterloo and get an hour and a half train to READING (it usually takes me an hour and a half to get <i>home</i>) and, of course, because it was sucky Good Friday all the shops were closed on the platforms so I couldn't get breakfast. Mope, mope, mope.

I got the best marks in Contemporary and Ballet that I've ever had, I've been working all the hours that God sends and I think I'm finally ready to go homehomehome.

Didn't get to watch much of Comic Relief but Patrick Stewart and Joshua Jackson took their bow with painted red noses (I thought they looked like they had colds) and asked the audience to give generously in a speech where Mr Stewart corrected Mr Jackson for saying 'bills' instead of 'notes'.

Well, when in Rome...

Saw something about the top British films of 2004 in which Harry Potter 3 came first. Forgive my ignorance... but I thought that a British film is made with British <i>money</i>. It's not British if it uses British actors and location in Britain with foreign money.

I've been reading too many books for my own good. Bought and read in the last three weeks:

1. My Sister's Keeper - Good
2. The American Boy - OK
3. The Time Traveler's Wife - Good.
4. One Child - Crap, crap, crap
5. The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Nighttime - it gave me headache. The language used gave me a headache and I had no sympathy for the character. At all. I kept thinking to myself, ""If I had to deal with that kid, I'd walk away."" But that reflects on me as a person, not the author as a writer.

Michael Howard's an idiot for raising the idea of lowering the number of weeks for an abortion. Yes, I'm not a Labour supporter but I truly hope this man does not get voted in. Whatever happened to Tory leader's that had personalities? Bring Mr Hague back is what I say.

Tony Blair's an idiot.

Gerry Adams is not a nice man at all. But I'm proud enough to say that I've known this for as long as I've been interested in politics. This hasn't been realised in the past few months for me.

And in a week's time I will be going home. Home to the sound of wind rustling through trees and the sound of the defiant fox hunter's trumpet. Yay!"

Nothing interesting happening. A lady had a miscarriage in the theatre on Saturday. She was distraught poor thing. Blood everywhere, I mean <i>everywhere</i> in the toilets. So much that we had to close it off for the following show.

Spoke to Geri Halliwell on Wednesday. Once to tell her where the toilets were and the second time I said ""jsbfosdonglnsofnosirnwenionf"", also known as, ""The Stage Manager is waiting for you by the private entrance"". Sometimes Sarah trips over her words too fast.

News: 

I am injured again. My left hamstring has almost completely recovered from the year and a half it shutdown and now my right is playing up. This means I must make a trip along the yellow brick road to Winfield Sports Clinic in Gloucestershire. They have a hamstring specialist there who was part of the GB Olympic Physio team last year. It'll be nice to know I've got one of the top people in their field checking out my groin. :) In a purely anatomical meaning of the word.

Last bit of news, which isn't really news. Now is the season for TV adverts promoting holidays, the most annoying one being the flying mermaid for Turkey. Does this happen in other countries? To promote tourism for Britain do they have flying Beefeaters? Perhaps Her Majesty flies while clutching a handbag and a corgi? Am curious.

Also, while browsing IMDb I came across a bit of news that paused my hand on the mouse. Brad Pitt is campaigning to save Eastenders from being axed from American TV? WTF? Is this true?"

Michael Crawford was the only good thing in it. But that's a given. He's fantastic anyway. And I was lucky enough to walk past him and give him a smile after the show while making my way to stage door.

Mince pies <i>are</i> christmas. Forget your gawdy trees and bits of shiny stuff. 

Also, today I held my two minute silence. I held it while I was alone while there was nobody to tell me to do it and I remembered.

And although I respect people's opinions on nearly everything, I 'm not scared to say that I wear my poppy with pride. And I always will."

"event","I had my first snub of my degree course yesterday.

I was talking to a lady customer at work last night and she asked me what I studied. I told her. I got a very disdainful look. ""Oh really?"" she said.

Now, I've never received a comment or look like that before when it's about my chosen field of study. Usually people, bless them, make a valiant effort to be interested and ""amazed"" that I'm doing a Degree in Contemporary Dance.

So, if there are any people out there that are dubious about what I do, this is for you.

Contemporary Dance Technique - every morning
Ballet Technique - every morning
DALI (Dance, Arts, Literature and Ideas)
Body Conditioning
Anatomy
Human Biology
Performance Studies
Professional Studies
History of Music
Choreography
Choreology
Doublework
Improvisation
Design for Dance

These are the subjects that I have to fit in the five days a week I have at school. These subjects are compulsory. If I don't turn up for one, I am marked as absent. I'm only allowed to miss 20% of classes each term. In some cases that means I'm allowed too miss two classes every 10 weeks. If I'm ill three times in a term, I'm fucked. Each subject is an hour and a half long and certain subjects we have to study twice a week. In the third year I have 10 other subjects to choose that aren't on this list.I'm at school from 8 in the morning and leave at 6 in the evening to go straight to work for half 6. My degree is vocational and therefore is worth more than a degree in English Literature or History because I'm learning a <i>trade</i>.

So fuck you, lady."

<lj user=""ari_o"">, CONGRATULATIONS BOO! Keep us updated, sweetheart.

<lj user=""daweaver"">, Happy Birthday Oh Wise One and I hope you had a good time around here. London, that is.

<lj user=""bochup"">, you go for the NaNoWriMoWhyIsThisNameSoWeird-o. You've got the talent to do it, just don't get stressed over it.

1. Tell me one thing you love about me.

2. Tell me two things you love about yourself. This one I'm particularly interested in, so make it good. I mean it. No self-deprication allowed!

3. Look through the comments ~ when you see someone you know, tell them three things you love about them.

4. Do this in your journal so I can tell you what I love about YOU - and if you've already done it, tell me so, so that I can go back and give you some love. (Optional, of course.)

Spread the love, people! We could all use it today!"

Should I go for it? It would mean (if I got the audition) spending Term 2 (January - April) in New York.

What do you guys think? Advice is helpful.

School rocks; I'm noticing improvement in myself which is a good sign. It helps that I've lost half a stone since I started 4 weeks ago (*smites the holidays of summer*) so I don't feel so conscious of being in tight clothing.

Let me tell you, having to look in a huge, fuck-off mirror 5 days a week can be mentally damaging."

"event","Every time something bad happened.. I'd ask myself ""I wonder what's going to happen next?"" and every time, something worse happened. I'm going to stop saying that. I'm cursing myself. My life is falling apart, it's so far gone. I have hit rock solid bottom. I'm hurting. I can't stop crying, or shaking. The second I stop crying and try to pull myself back together, I think of more memories, and just cry again. I hate this.

Want to see how shitty my life has fallen to?
Ohhh, let's share... 

Well, the bad luck streak started off last Sunday or Monday. Rick and I didn't talk for 3 days straight. Then we started talking, I was relieved. Thenn I knew something was up with my parents, but tried to blow it off. On Thursday (the 27th), my baby hamster, Houdini died. That crushed me, I was simply heartbroken. Rick buried him in his backyard behind his garage, decorated a little box and everything. Then on Friday night, some immature ass idiot threw a rock (now mind you, this rock was no normal rock, it was a boulder, bigger than my head.. I could barely pick it up.) through our brand new monsterous front window. I was home alone. It was at 2:30 in the morning. I'm just 17 years old. I didn't know what was happening. I ran into my parents room, locked the door, and called my brother. My brother? Not the cops? Yes. Calling the cops didn't even cross my mind at the second. My neighbors across the street, and down a few houses heard it (I'm telling ya, it was LOUD) and rushed over. I was shaking beyond belief so they were trying to calm me down. Josh flew home at 100 mph, turned into our driveway 100 mph. Josh = pissed = not a good thing. I kept staring at the window, in complete shock. Josh was pissed. Then my boyfriend Rick came over, then some of Josh's friends came over.. Joe, Ann, and his gf Katie. The cops also came, even though we shouldn't have bothered. Lazy F's. They were here for about 5 minutes, at most. They took down names of people that we thought could have done it, that hated us, or whatever. Out of 3 cops, only 1 came 5 feet away from the house, simply said ""Wow, that's a big ass rock."" Hey thanks. They didn't even check the house, to make sure no one entered and was hiding, waiting to kill us. Thanks cops! I hate them now. They left saying ""we'll go patrol the area."" They never did shit. So we were all sitting there, with one shattered big ass window.. and nothing to do. My brother and Joe took cardboard boxes, tore them apart, and duct taped them up over our window. I did not feel the least bit safe. I slept downstairs for 2 nights. I hated life. I felt so unsafe in my own home. For the next few days, all I could hear every 5 seconds was glass shattering in my head. I still hear it, but not as often. If I'm just sitting, not doing something.. then I'll hear it. Ok, so Sunday, my parents come home, all hell breaks loose. I won't go into so much details. Ummm, my fishie Phoenix (1 of 4) in my new tank died. So yesterday, another fishie, Mews, died. Ready for the BIG one? My parents are getting a divorce. Yeah. I hate my dad for it. I hate him. It's like he was all prepared for this. I HATE him. My mom is just always crying, and it breaks my heart.. I love her sooo much, and she doesn't deserve this one bit. I cried all day yesterday when I found out. I cried myself to sleep. My life is just falling apart. Everything is just gone. All the future dreams, possible memories.. gone. I hate life. I hate it all. I hate my friends for not being there for me. I hate them. Friends are supposed to be there for you, through thick and thing. Shit gets rough, and now.. I have no one. I hate this."

""I can't be losing sleep over this, no I can't.. and now I cannot stop pacing. Give me a few hours, I'll have this all sorted out.. if my mind would just stop racing. Cause I cannot stand still.

And everything will be back to the way that it was. I wish that it was just that easy."" ~Lifehouse

~*~*~*~*~*~~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

I feel like I have so much to write.. but I really don't know where to begin, so who knows how long this will be. I apoligize now for any random blabbing that will arise. I don't know why I feel so unsafe in this house. Well, yeah, what happened was serious, but it's been two days, right? Well, technically, but I still hear the glass shattering in my head LOUD and CLEAR.. about every 5 seconds, it's just in the back of my mind. I don't think people realize how affected I am by what happened. I was so scared, for myself, for my life.. I thought it was all over. I was home alone. It happened at 2:30 in the morning. I didn't think of some idiotic kids messing around.. I thought of a killer. Good lord. ::glass shatters:: I can't walk out there into the living room without getting the chills. When it's night, I won't turn my light on in my room, I don't want people seeing my light on.. and having a chance to mess with me. Reality? Nah, I doubt that'll happen, but I'm just scared. I'm paranoid. I never shook so hard.. if I didn't get shot or stabbed to death, I definitely almost woulda had a heart attack. Images and noises are playing over and over. Am I being a baby about this? Who knows? Am I being over-dramatic? Maybe.

I hung out with Rick on Saturday night, until like 3:30 in the morning. We just drove around for a little bit, he got me some food.. went to his house for a few minutes, then drove around.. and we went to Fort Fraser, laid out a blanket, and looked at the stars. I was completely paranoid the whole time, just waiting for some pyscho to pop out. I feel bad. Rick was sooo sweet to me though. Just the idea of laying with my hunny looking up at the stars is definitely romantic and sweet... but I blew it, I was such a freak. Every little noise, I jumped up. Then we went back to his house, and he just held me in his arms, I may have fell asleep.. I just drifted in and out of my speeding mind. So he dropped me off, and flashbacks and glass shattering noises sped in my mind as I walked into my house. Josh and his friends were sitting in the living room/dining room.. but I guess I kinda avoided them and flew to my room.. Josh ran after me. He's definitely a good brother. I'm actually really glad that he and I are getting along better. He kept asking what's wrong.. but what the hell was I gonna say? ""Josh, I'm scared to death, and all I can hear is glass shattering in my mind.."" He'd probably tell me to get over it. I don't know. I slept downstairs in his living room on the pullout couch/bed thing for the past two nights.

I'm really glad that my parents are home. I wish I'd feel better that they are here.. and I'm not totally alone. For some reason, I'm still feeling the same. I love my parents to death.. I just don't know why I'm not comforted by their presences. My mom is sleeping out in the living room right now, and that is making me a nervous wrecking ball of paranoia. Goodness, do I even make sense? I'm so scared for her laying out there. I'm so scared to sleep in my own room. I just want to curl into a ball in the safest spot in my house.. I just want to run away.. I don't know. 

I think that whoever did this.. definitely got what they bargained for. Now, I'm assuming.. that they just wanted to give a good scared, to get back at whatever they were so angry for... but they terrified me, traumatized me.. good God. I never want to stay home alone again, never ever. Every car that passes by, I freak out and peek out a window. Every little noise gets to me. 

::glass shatters in my head::

I hate this.
I'm not overreacting.
I'm sorry I'm such a baby."

"event","I never knew how big of a$$holes people could be in my life until last night.... I never knew how scared for my life I could be until last night also. F off.

I have the <b>best</b> brother for rushing home. I have the <b>best</b> boyfriend for coming over at 3:00 in the morning to help me out. Katie, Joe, and Ann also helped out. Damn. Maybe you think that I'm making a big deal out of how fricking scared I was, but no.. I thought I was going to die. 

Bahhhh.. I now hate people that I barely know.

Rick, I told you that this is the week from hell. Look at everything that's happened.. ""Friday will be the best day of this week."" Man, I was wrong... ""I wonder what else is gonna happen this week.."" I so cursed it all.

When the cop asked my brother if anyone hates him.. or whatever.. I thought about for me, and two girls crossed my mind.. and I wonder how immature they'd sink down to just because they don't like me. Maybe? But then I look at the size of the fricking BOULDER rock.. and I just don't know. 

The funny thing about tonight? (Funny? Yeah, I was shaking and scared outta my mind, I'm glad they were being funny.) My brother and Joe were hilarious.. toll booths, chasing people, flashlights, ""duck"", duct taping and the cardboard.. oh man..

Besides that, this matter is really nothing to joke about.. and people really do need to grow up. Hate is a strong ass word. There is no freaking need to go psychotic if you ""hate"" or ""dislike"" someone. Last night was so freakin scary, last night.. I dunno, clicked somethin in my head. I just can't get it out into words.

Rick took the cage and was trying to poke him. I knew he was dead then.. =( It was so sad! I cried.. I'm a loser, hehe. He was such a cute and fun little hamster. Rick put him in a little box and decorated it, and buried him behind his garage. =*(

I'm thinking about either..
1. Making this journal friends only
2. Waiting to see if I can find a code from someone so I can make a new one
3. Just deleting it..

(DOES ANYONE HAVE A CODE THAT I CAN HAVE? PLLEASEEE)

Because I now know that a few people read this that I'd rather them not to. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do yet. But how would I know yet? =) .. I'm just a <i>fat, ugly, stupid girl</i>. Right? hahahahah! Oh man. People amuse me. I love how some people feel the need to judge people right off the bat, without even getting to know them, or just knowing anything about them. I love how immature people can be. And I also know, that after they read this, they are just gonna be even more immature about what I'm writing. But it's cool. Senior year is coming up, and I'm going to have fun with all of my friends, and make it really memorable. =) Another thing that I don't understand, is I read certain things, and I don't get how people can say that they hate being judged, they hate all these things.. and yet THEY criticize OTHER people for the same things? Ahhh, I just don't understand! I don't have a problem with anyone.. well, the only problem is basically what I've just been saying.. sick of this pointless crap going on. Senior year is coming up, and it's gonna be so fun, no need for grudges, but hey.. like I said, I'm just some fat stupid chick? LoL, what would I know!?!?"

"event","Last night, I talked to an ""old"" friend online for quite awhile. He made me realize a lot of things, and we just talked about soo much. It helped me out a lot. I woke up today to my Uncle Marty and his friend, they were being SO loud. They were installing our new air conditioner (whewww), and so one was upstairs, while the other one was downstairs or outside.. and they would just YELL/SCREAM to each other. Goodness! LoL.. other than that, today was a pretty relaxing day. Sara came home today from Sandy Pines (her summer place), so we talked for a little bit. She's driving back out there tomorrow morning or whatever, lol. She got her senior picture previews back too! =) I love my pictures, I can't decide what I want, ahhh, I love all of the ones that I got taken outside, hmmm.. LoL. Anyway! When I was trying to do my hair today, I was getting so frustrated. Oh my goodness, it would NOT stay flipped out no matter how much I used the curling iron, then I tried using my Sheer Blonde hair putty molding crap on it - didn't work, then I just got impatient and straightened it out, haha, whatever. Then Amanda and I drove out to Somerset Mall (::sigh of relief:: shopping ALWAYS makes me feel better). I bought something from Pacific Sunwear, and Amanda bought a necklace from The Limited (I think) for her senior pictures. We walked around the whole mall, and ate dinner.. and just talked, it was fun. =) I love that girl to death, hehe. She's my shopping buddy, and such a great friend!! I was watching Jawbreaker a little while ago, definitely an interesting movie, and coloring in my Finding Nemo coloring book (I know, I'm a cool kid..)! I'm probably gonna relax tonight, take a bath and what not. Sorry, I definitely babble too much in this thing, oh well! Haha.. ~Stinaaaa

It's going to be really hard without my mom around now.. =\

Thanks to all of my friends who have been there for me lately.
I appreciate it so much.."

"event","I've been hanging out with my baby a lot lately. He's the only thing that makes sense in my life these days. He makes me so happy, and he makes me feel like life is worth living. He can always put a smile on my face, and he usually knows what to say at the right times. When my life is so messed up, I know that I have him to run to. I hope that he will always be there for me. I love how we can do anything, sit around, go out to the movies, go shopping, whatever.. and just have a great time. I never get bored with him. He's a weird one at times, yes, but he's mine. It's good stuff. 

So today, we just hung around. We had a hunt for some wood, lol, to have a bonfire in his backyard. That was fun, hahaha.. listening to the drunks a few houses down from him singing kareoke, lmao.. oh man. Rick and I were just sitting there watching the fire or whatever, then you had these wacko girls singing (I think that's what they were trying to do) their hearts out to old songs, haha, oh man, good stuff. 

I'm wide awake, this sucks. I have 51 people signed onto my buddy list right now, and I don't want to talk to anyone.. weird how that works. Right now, I feel like going out and running and runnninnggg until I can't anymore. Too bad it's 1:00 in the morning and my parents would probably think I'm pyscho if they woke up. I don't really know what's going on within the next few days. I want to lay out and get a tan. I want some sunshine and 80-85 degree weather, RIGHT NOW. And I want to go rollerblading. I want to go swimming. I want to go horse back riding. I want to parrtyyy. I love summer time. This Friday, I think I have to go to a funeral memorial service thing.. =\ and then on Saturday, I have to babysit my cousins Eric and Alex. But that's like a week away. I don't know what's going on until then. I'm gonna go, LoL, I don't know what to say, and I'm gonna end up babbling, okie.. see ya!!

"event","I've been feeling pretty crappy on the inside lately. Today was supposed to be such a great day.. I was hoping to get a call from Patrick Studios saying that my senior picture proofs were in, but I didn't. They said 7-10 days, and I had my pictures taken on June 26.. so hopefully soon? I was looking forward to getting fishies, and I did.. Rick and I went to Petsmart, but most of the cute ones were too big (I bought a cute little one gallon tank).. so I drove over to Meijers. I picked out my kissing fish that I've been wanting for so long, and I named it Romeo.. and Rick picked out a cute little orangey black fish.. and named it Spike. I'm gonna see how they are for a few days, then I'm going to buy more if it's good. I want 3-4 little fish, it'll be good... But anyway.. I dunno, I feel like I just want to scream and cry my eyes out so bad.. =\ This feeling is so intense lately. If I'm out doing something, I can throw a smile on my face so easily.. but the feelings, the thoughts, everything running in my head.. it's just crazy. I try so hard to keep myself from breaking down. People always think I'm such a happy person, I can't help but to smile and agree. I feel that if I said no, and break it down to them, they wouldn't know how to react.. be scared off, or give me sympathy, and I don't want that. I wish I could pinpoint all of this within me, but I can't. I feel like I'm running in circles. I hate people who try to tear me down. If you don't like me, fine, get the F over it. I didn't do anything so horribly to anyone where I deserve any pain. I wish people weren't so immature. I wish people could grow up and move on. I wish people would live their own lives. I wish people would stop interferring with others' lives. I don't know. I wish I had the strength to push away from everyone, and just be alone.. and that's weird, because I HATE being alone. I hate this empty feeling. I'll be just sitting somewhere, layin down at night, or just layin at Rick's house.. and I'll be thinking of everything, and just fall apart. It's so pathetic. Senior year is coming up quick, and I don't want to feel like this. I don't want to feel like being alone. I want to enjoy it with my friends. I don't want idiots trying to tear me apart. I hate sitting here at night.. listening to my playlist of songs. Some are happy songs, some are sad, some are angry.. and it just gives me a rollercoaster of emotions. It's like halfway through summer, and I have loved every minute of it.. I really could not ask for a better time.. I just wish this ""inside of me"" bull crap would go away. I think sometimes of people at Mott or wherever else, and realize how dramatic a lot of people are.. and then I start to wonder if people are sitting there thinking the same thing.. and if I'm included in it. I don't know. I say that a lot. But in reality, I really don't know. You can always look for answers, but in the end, you'll always have more questions. I talked to a few people today.. who I thought hated me, but they don't, which was cool.. an eye opener, I guess. I think a lot of people hate me, but in the end, they never really do hate me. I only truly hate 3 people, and they hate me.. so I guess that cancels out. I don't know. I just feel like there is so much wrong. I try so hard for things to be good, for everyone to be happy.. and I usually end up falling flat on my face. Maybe I need to try something else, maybe I already have tried. I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I could fast forward through these crappy parts of life.. but then, there wouldn't be anything to build up on, to become stronger from, right?

"event","Tonight is the last night that I will walk alone. Tonight is the last night I will call this place my home. I have fought many windmills, and chased after wind, I've clasped my hands around nothing again and again. We're all just bleeding to death from self inflicted wounds, we're all obtaining careers to provide our dooms. Blindfolded and naive, lay our treasures in our fireplaces, place our children on the train tracks and pull the wool over their faces. I have made some twine with selfish ambition and thread, and sewed up my cuts before I'd be dead. I tied knots with faith in the world and myself, living for pleasure and toiling for wealth. I played outside for years with a butterfly net, chasing the wind every day before the sun set. Then I cried into my pillow and clinched my fists, and looked for new things to sew up my wrists. Ignoring the voice that whispered ""Goodnight sweetheart.."" I refuse to admit the stitches are coming apart. 

The years all went by and I am alone, everything has turned to dust that I called my own. I can't find something worth anything as far as I can see, the jars for the wind I've been chasing are empty. Nothing in this world has lasted or put hope in my heart, the stitches have unraveled and are coming apart. 

Just beneath my wrists I watched this scarlet puddle grow, I can't find anything more that I can use to sew. At the end of my rope is dangling a noose, I have tied while living for nothing, and found nothing of any use. I am tired of fighting windmills and I'm tired of chasing the wind, I will not open my hands to find nothing ever again. 

Then His voice whispered to me before I closed my eyes, ""I have already given you My life, so why is it that you choose to die?"" Then I saw Him there standing over me, I covered my wrists, afraid that He would see. I couldn't look in His eyes and I felt so ashamed, I tried to hide all the blood colored stains. And my voice was shaking as i started to cry, I could feel that soon I was going to die. ""I have nothing to fill all the holes in my heart ... The stitches have unraveled and are coming apart. I have chased after wind for a very long time, still I have nothing worth saying is mine. Everything I did was for nothing and now I'm bleeding to death, and when I'll be dead I will still not have rest."" As the blood ran down like the tears in my eyes, the only thing I have heard that has freedom from lies, spilled over His lips on to me, pale and broken. Of all of the words I have heard to be spoken, all of the sorrow and all the regret, the years, the toil, the butterfly nets, this wasted life and all of this ... this never ending emptiness ... washed away below my arms in the blood that poured down, the thread and the stitches fell to the ground. His words blanketed me as my pain reached it's end, ""I've loved you forever, and My love never ends."""

"event","Well, I'm sitting here listening to my mix cd of 21 Dashboard Confessional songs that I made a long time ago, and thinking. You know what I've realized? I think that I think too much.. resulting in major worries, headaches, tears... pain.. Isn't it weird how some lyrics can fit so perfect, and make you cry? ... ""This is where I say I've had enough and no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises, and I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any better."" ~Dashboard Confessional

But anyway. It seems to me as that I'm definitely not happy with my life. Overall, I'm a happy person, but I'm just not happy with my life. Does that even make sense? I'm not very close with any girls, and that kind of sucks. Sometimes, you just need a girl friend to go out with for the night, just to talk.. and hang out. You know? Maybe it's just me. Life was so much simplier when I was 7. I don't know. Maybe life isn't supposed to be simple. Maybe you just need to be strong to survive in the long run. 

I look at myself.. in the mirror, in my head.. and I HATE what I see. In the mirror, I just want to bash my fist into the mirror. In my head, I get so upset. I don't know why I'm like this, I don't know what made me this way. Well.. maybe it's because all I do is think. My mind is running 110 mph all of the time. I don't fall asleep until.. anywhere from 4-7 every night (morning actually..?) because I'm just making myself sick from worrying and thinking. I feel like I sleep my life away, but I'm not.. I'm just going to bed late, and waking up late. I don't know. What is wrong with me? I'd love to figure that out.

Life. Life is weird. Life is F'ed up. I want to change so much about myself. I hate the people that try to bring me down. I hate that they have absolutely NO reason to bring me down, just for their own pleasure. What goes around comes around. I'm so glad that this is summer. The next time that I step into Warren Mott High School.. will be as a senior. My senior year. Class of 2004. One more year of that hell hole. I really hate it there. I'd have to say that 90% of the teachers are F'ed up. I'd talk to pretty much anyone who talks to me, student body wise.. but I do believe that a lot of people under estimate me. One more year, then I'm stepping out into reality. I really wish to get out of there. I'm excited for college, even if I have to go to Macomb for 1-2 years before I'm out of here. New people. New environment. More idiots, probably, but definite new-ness is good.

My wishes/dreams?
This is my last summer before I'm outta high school. I want my senior year to be the best that it can be. I want no regrets. I want no major fights. I don't want to look back on it and get upset. I want good grades. I want my parents proud of me. I want to graduate and be proud of myself. I want to go to Grand Valley or Michigan State. I know I will end up having to go to Macomb for 1-2 years first.. but I want to end up at GVSU or MSU. I want to study psychology, and probably become a child psychologist (that's what I want as of right now). I want to get settled in my own house.. a big house, with a big bathroom, and a huge bathtub to relax in. (Isn't that odd that in my house, I just want a huge bathroom? I love pampering myself.. so pathetic, but I love it. Big jacuzzi tub, mmm..) I want to come home to a cute a$$ Husky puppy with big blue/silver eyes. I want a husband that will love me for me, and be there for me. I do eventually want kids. I want to die happy. I want to be able to look back at everything, and smile with tears in my eyes. 

What am I supposed to do now? I don't know. Now I'm listening to my Evanescence cd. I'm crying. I'm talking to Rick.

Rick. I wish he would realize that I'm here for him. I love that boy so unbelievably much. Him and I have been pretty close friends since 9th grade. We have definitely been to hell and back, and everything in between. He means so much to me. I don't care what anyone says anymore. They don't know what we have. They don't see what's between us. We definitely have something that is hard to have, hard to see, hard to believe in. It's so good. I love being in his arms, it takes all my pain and fears away. He knows when I want to cry but inside, I'm doing all that I can to hold it in. I love having the scent of him follow me home.. or when I crawl into bed at night, and I just smell him.. it's so good. I know that may sound crazy, but it just makes me smile. The two stuffed animals I have from him, Casper and Nemo.. are the only ones on my bed lately.. usually I have all 38725's of my stuffed animals covering my bed (yes, the child within me). He's all I can think about. I love him. I do. I love you Rick. I love you more and more every day. I'm sorry for the pain that I have ever caused you. I'm trying so hard to make things work. I hope that my brother and my parents will learn to see the good in you. There is just so much of it. The things you say to me.. the things you do for me.. you are so sweet. There is not that many REAL good guys in the world, and I'm so lucky and thankful to be able to say that I have one.

That's enough.. I'm sorry for whoever just read that.."

When you can still feel their arms around you tight, long after they are gone. When you can still taste their kiss after you have said good bye. You can tell you're in love when you miss them before they are gone. When their voice lingers in your ear. When their presence eases any pain. When their name sends a chill down your spine. When they are the only thing you can think of. You know you're in love when you can see all their hopes, dreams, and soul when you look into their eyes. When they call you at four in the morning just to say ""I love you"" and mean it. When your tears stain not only their shirt, but also their heart. When they are hurt just because of these tears. When even a simple chore done with them can become a lasting memory. Ultimately you know you're in love when you can't imagine living without them, and you can't figure out how you did live before you knew them. When they fulfill every need.. and without them you are incomplete. The love of someone else completes the heart, soul, and mind all at once."

"event","While I was ""flying"" down the road yesterday (i.e. 4 mph over the limit), I passed over a bridge only to find cop with a radar gun on the other side laying in wait.

The cop pulled me over, walked up to the car, and with that classic patronizing smirk we all know and love, asked, ""What's your hurry?""

To which I replied, ""I'm late for work.""

""Oh yeah,"" said the cop, ""what do you do?""

""I'm a rectum stretcher,"" I responded.

The cop was stammered, ""A what? A rectum stretcher? And just what does a rectum stretcher do?""

""Well,"" I said, ""I start by inserting one finger, then I work my way up to two fingers, then three, then four, then with my whole hand in I work side to side until I can get both hands in, and then I slowly but surely stretch, until it's about 6 foot wide.""

""And just what the hell do you do with a 6 foot asshole?""

To which I politely replied, ""You give him a radar gun and park him behind a bridge.....""

Court Costs: $45.00

Yesterday, Rick and I drove out to my cousin Jake's house. We just sat around and talked for the most part. I got to see their new puppy!! It was an 7-8 week old Beagle. Her name was Daisy. She was soooo cute, hehe, and very playful. We also all drove to a pet store to get Houdini a cage thing. It's like a space ship habitrail, lol, it's cool.. and I guess Houdini likes the wheel.

After Jakes, we went back to Rick's, and we took a little nap together.. I love laying in his arms. That's good stuff. Then we put Houdini's new ""house"" together, that was interesting, haha. Thennn we started to watch Simon Birch, but we didn't finish because I had to go home. It's a cute movie so far, he's so cute, hehe. Then I came home, Rick and I talked on the phone for 2 hours, then I went right to sleep. =) Good frickin stuff. I loved talking to him right before falling asleep.

I woke up around 12:30. I made a bagel and just watched a little bit of tv. Now I'm here. I don't know what I'm doing today. I'm gonna go take a shower or somethin though. See ya!!

Then Patrick walked in, and he goes, so who's this Rick person? And I smiled really big again and he took another pic. LoL. Cheaters! =) It was really fun.

"event","My mom woke me up today around 11:00ish, I think.. and we went to Target. =) Haha. I came home.. Amanda and I wanted to go to the beach to lay out and swim, and you know? I don't really know what happened with that, lol. We ended up washing my mom's car and laying out on my deck in my backyard. It was fun. We sprayed this dark tanning oil on ourselves.. we want the ""lil white girl"" labels to get off of us, lol. I love the smell of oil (and suntan lotion), haha, I'm weird. We laid out on our backs, and listened to 4-5 songs, then flipped over. By the time I flipped, I was SO hot and gross, I wanted to get up but I was thinking that I'd be okay. (::flashing lights::) So I'm an idiot. I was getting a weird feeling in me. I felt like my heart beating through my entire body, and I couldn't see. So finally, I turned to Amanda and I like man, I'm hot.. and I got up. I got so dizzy and I couldn't see. I grabbed my stuff and went into my house.. we went to my room where I fell onto my bed, then I went to the bathroom, where I fell. I remember falling and I remember drinking lots of water. When I came out, my mom asked me if I was okay, and I said no, and she said I was banging everything around in the bathroom. =\ So laying out in the sun for an hour to an hour and a half isn't good for Stina. This happened before in Wisconsin with Steph, where I got too much sun and I passed out constantly. So anyway, then Amanda left, and I fell into my bed and I was shaking so bad, I guess I passed out.. fell asleep, something. Then my mom woke me up, Nando called from California! We talked for about 10-15 minutes. (My mom bought him a 500 minute phone card.) It sounds like he's having fun, which is good. He was saying how it's like 60-70 degrees out there, and I told him about my sunshine fun, and how it's like 90 degrees here, and he got mad, lol. Thennn, I took a nice long shower to try to calm down and what not. I still felt like crap after I got out. Showers always make me feel better!!!!!! Hehe. Then I went out with my baby!! =) =) =) We went to Petco, Best Pets, and Meijers looking for a hamster. I want a teddy bear hamster so bad, but it's too bad my mom would absolutely SHOOT me, lol. Then we went back to his house, and his FREEZING cold upstairs, brrrrrr. We watched Ghost, which is a weird movie, but I think I liked it, I got a little confused at times, lol. I love just laying in his arms and just watching a movie, listening to music, or talking.. or just laying there. It feels so good. Good stuff. I could lay in them for hours and hours. Man. I wish I was with him now, hehe, but I have Casper with me. And he still has Nemo, sneaky little butthead. I forgot about my Nemers. I came home around 10:00? I still feel like crap. But the funny thing is, I'll probably lay out again tomorrow. =\ I'm an idiot. I want to be tan though so bad. We'll see. I'm waiting for Rick to get back home so I can talk to him for a little bit, then I'm going to bed. Nuh-night!!"

"event","Today was pretty good. I woke up so late, I think I woke up around 4:00, that's so bad. I was kinda mad because I wanted to lay outside and get some sun, but that's okay.. I still have all summer, haha. Jessica IMed me around 6:00 asking me if I wanted to go on a ""road trip"" at 7:30, lol. It was a little road trip to go to Grosse Point to Starbucks to see some guy Dan. I was kinda confused but I went with her anyway. We were blasting music, singing, and dancing around like idiots.. this one Chaldean kid was next to us at a red light laughing at us. =( Then when we entered the ghetto, we locked up the truck, lmao. We got lost on the way there, and we ended up in the scary ghetto with bums pushing shopping carts talking to themselves. I guess you really had to be there. So we got lost, then Jess called her friends to come find us and we waited in a Petco parking lot. Mmmmmm, her friends pulled up in a new Cavalier, I was drooling, haha. That's good stuff. It was red, and low, and so beautiful, haha. Then we drove to Starbucks, Jessica and I were WAY off on directions, like 10 miles off, but it's okay. =) NEVER trust me with directions, I don't know where the hell I'm going.. ANYWHERE. So there ended up being more people there, I only knew 2 of the girls from before. I knew Liz from playing volleyball with her last week.. and I knew one of the Ashley's from going to a party with her a long time ago. Then there was another Ashley, her sister, Dan, and Ben. We sat inside for awhile, then we decided it was cold in there and too nice outside so we went outside.. anddddd stood there deciding what to do for about an hour and a half, haha. ADD? Yeah, definitely. We were going to go to the apartment boys' softball game, but I don't know what happened with that? We decided to go to Fort Frasser to play volleyball. Jessica ran over Dan's foot in the Starbucks parking lot, he was so pissed.. then Jessica got outta the truck and ran after him.. anddd Ben hopped in Jessica's truck with me and drove off. It was scary, he almost killed me a bunch of times. We talked about Linkin Park, I revealed my undying love for Linkin Park to him and he was laughing at me about it. I can see why Jessica likes him.. he's a good guy, and I hope things work out for them. I'm out of the loop, I don't know what's going on with that. But anyway, Ben drove crazy in Jessica's truck on the way to Fort Fraser. We got there first because we're awesome. Then we played volleyball for awhile, and got bit up and full of sand. Running on the WET grass to get the ball when it went out then going back on the sand is not a good fun thing to do. YUCK. So then 3 car loads of unknown older (20's) people came to the court, and we decided to share and we played against them. Wow, we sucked compared to them, but it's okay, it was fun. They were kinda mean, and they probably went home laughing at us. We didn't work as a team, and we'd always yell and fall.. haha, diving into the sand. Wooo! Oh yes, then I was serving, and I hit the ball and it SMACKED Jessica right in her face. I felt so unbelievably bad but she was laughing her ass off. Yeahhhhh, then we played football for like 2 and 1/2 minutes, and Jessica and I went home. Now I'm here. I'm all bit up by mosquitos which is no fun. Tonight was good though. I'm not sure what's going on all this week. I know it's supposed to be HOT and sunny. I think Amanda and I are going to the beach to lay out and swim one day.. and anyone who wants to join us. Yepp.. and hopefully seeing lots of my baby!! I didn't get to see him today, I miss him. It's so weird how much I can miss him just from not seeing him for 1 day. I love him lots, he's so good to me. He stole Nemo away from me, so all I get to sleep with is Casper. Casper smells like him, and Nemo will too when I get him back.. which I love, so it's okay. =) I'm gonna go to bed in a little bit, I'm WIIDDEE awake though, haha, but I need to go to bed early so I don't wake up at 4 again, ahh! haha! This entry was detailed and probably boring, sorry.. oh well. Goodnight!!"

"event","I don't really remember when I wrote last, and I'm definitely too tired to go back and look. Saturday, I woke up around 11:15ish, and jumped in the shower. Ryan and Fernando picked me up around 1:00, then we picked up Lisa.. Ryan's girlfriend. We drove to Metro airport, got lost a few times, and it took a lot longer than it should have because Ryan and Lisa kept arguing over where he was supposed to drive. Oh well. Fernando got there on time. His flight departed at 4:10, and we got him there at 2:00.. so he could get through security and find where he had to go. I got out of the car to hug him goodbye, and he said ""I'll miss you, take care of yourself while I'm gone."" and I just nodded my head, let go, and jumped back in the car.. then started to cry. I still don't know why I didn't say anything. He's been my best friend for a year or two now.. and he'll be gone this whole summer, until August 21. I made him a scrapbook full of quotes, lyrics, weird shit to read, pictures, stickers.. just stuff to look at while he's in California for the summer. I think it came out really cute. Then when I came home, I changed into my skirt, then drove over to Rick's house because he's an awesome boyfriend who runs right out on short notice to get me a scratch off lottery ticket (for my cousin's birthday), then ran to get a birthday card for my cousin, thennn ran to my aunt's house for the party. I stayed there for about 2 hours, it was nice talking with my family and such, hehe. I came home again, sat around for a little bit, exercised a little bit, thennn Rick came over. We went and FOUND NEMO!! =) What a fricking great movie. I love Squirt, the little baby sea turtle. That movie amazed me, I love it. =) Thenn we came back here, and listened to music and what not.. and now, I'm beyond tired, and I can't see straight, so I'd say it's definitely bed time for me. Sweeeet dreams, goodnight.

Mannnn, I love my Rick. =) =)

Saturday, I rearranged my room, and cleaned it all.. whew, that was good fun, jk, lol. Thenn got together with a lot of friends, and a bunch of my brother's friends.. we all hung out in the backyard. That, again, was also very fun. Lots of memories for that night.

Sunday, Ryan asked me to go to Best Buy and Hostess with him.. so I did, then we stopped by Sherry's graduation party for a little bit. Wow, I never felt so out of place in my life. She's such a sweetie though, I was happy for her. =) Thenn came home. I was just lounging around the house, haha, then Brennan and I went to Wilkerson Elementary school and played on the playground. That school has like 3 big playgrounds, I loved it, even though I couldn't reach half the toys. I don't understand that!? I'm short, yes, for my age, I'm only 5'2'', but ELEMENTARY kids are shorter than me, how does that work!? Oh well, haha. I came home and just passed out in my bed, I was a tired lil girl.

Monday, I woke up around 12ish.. mmmm, sleeping in feels sooo good!! Amanda and I went shopping at Oakland Mall. I swear, she is definitely my shopping buddy. I bought a REALLY cute skirt by Calvin Klein.. it was $44 on sale, 30% off, I think it came out to $32 or something like that. It's very cute. I never used to wear skirts, but now, since AMANDA, I'm loving all kinds of them!! Haha. The skirt is short and simple, it's jean, it's very cute. Anndd I bought a cute pair of comfy shorts from American Eagle.. they are maroonish red. =) I love shopping. Thennn, I came home, laid around.. talking to friends.. thenn Amanda picked me up and we went over to Jessica's house with Nando. We all drove to Fort Fraser, and some of Jessica's friends met us up there, Liz and.. another girl, I don't remember her name. We all played volleyball, 3 against 3. That was sooo fun, lmao, a good time, definitely. Then we played on the ""fort"". It was sooo fun, a big ass playground, lol. A little boy took the volleyball from Nando, and threw it down on Amanda's head when she was climbing down this tire thing. Nando and I got mad and kinda yelled at him saying that wasn't nice, and so the snotty little boy said so come after me.. or something stupid like that, then he basically followed us around everywhere. Ugh.. I hate little boys, devils. Soo then we all went back to Jessica's house, where three more girls came over. Amy, Taylor, Liz, Jess, Nando, Amanda, and I.. we all watched Ice Age, and talked, lol. Then came home, yes, now I'm here.

I'm definitely one tired Stina.

This week is going to be soooo busy.

Tomorrow (today) Tuesday: lol, some of us are going rollerblading at Metro.

Wednesday: shopping and a movie

Thursday: picnic, swimming, and having fun at Stoney Creek

Friday: zoo

Saturday: Nando leaves for 2 months.

We're all trying to throw ""summer with the crew"" into one week for Nando before he leaves us.

"event","This weekend was a pretty great weekend, sooo fun. So after school on Friday, went shopping real quick with mom, then I packed for the weekend, then drove over to Julia's house. We talked for a little bit while she finished up packing, then we ran up to Rite-Aid so she could buy some make up and a blowdryer. Thennn we went back to her house, and got ready to leave. We rode up with her dad, brother, and his friend in the truck. Ummm, it took about 2 hours to get to her camping place. It was nice out there, it's a cute little place, lol. Everyone was so friendly there. We played basketball with these people that she's met up there before, they all seemed pretty nice. Ummm, we all went to sleep. Woke up, showered in the public bathrooms with the clear shower doors, lmao, but Julia and I brought a cd thing and blasted Simple Plan. =) Thennn her friends met us at her camper, or something.. I don't remember how we all met up, lol, but we all just chilled around for awhile, then walked around.. and then we went SwImMiNg!! Wooo!! I love it! We went swimming in the ICE cold pool that was outside for like 15 minutes, then we'd run to the hot tub, sit in there for like 30 minutes, then jump (or in my case, get thrown/pushed into the ice cold pool, and repeat.. haha. It was soo beautiful outside on Saturday, perfect day for all that good stuff. We were swimming for like 3-4 hours. LoL, then we walked around.. we played truth or dare late at night by the lake, darkness, lmao, it was fun. We went to bed around 1:00ish in the morning, we woke up late.. 10:30-11:00.. we wanted to be up by 8 to shower and visit everyone.. but oh well. So we ran around packing and then left. Then I came home.. umm, talked online, unpacked, then hung out with my Rick. I can't even describe how happy I am to be with him. Whenever he hugs me, everything.. all the pain and worry in my head just goes away. I love that boy. He's so good to me. Anyway. This weekend is on my definite top 10 of my life, haha, it was good. Tomorrow is our last full day of school as a junior, then 3 half days which are our finals. Good luck everyone!! Then it's SUMMERR!!! Man, I'm full of bruises and mosquito bites, I got sun burned shoulders, and my feet are beyond sore from running/walking around ALL weekend in little flip flops, especially in the woods.. lol, but the weekend was well worth it. See yaa!!"

"event","Today, during 2nd hour, we had the new seniors meeting. We talked about seniors pictures and voted for everything.. I'm not really happy with the results, but hey, what am I going to do?

*Class Colors: baby blue and silver
*Class Song: Spice Girls ""Goodbye""
*Class Mascot: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
*Class Flower: Orchad
*Class Motto: I live my life for the nights I'll always remember with the friends that I'll never forget.

The only things that I voted for out of all those that won was the class colors and class motto. For the song, I voted for Aerosmith ""Don't Want To Miss A Thing"". For the class mascot, I voted for GusGus (the fat lil mouse from Cinderella!!). For the flower, I voted for black rose. 

Oh well.

I have to go pack. I don't think anyone realizes how thankful, how happy I am.. to get away for the weekend. I need this more than anything. It's time to get away, run away from my problems.. it's what I do best. Too bad they will be waiting here for me when I get back. I'll be back Sunday. Have a great weekend. 4 more days of school left, 3 of which are half days for the finals. =) ~Stina"

"event","So today, school was shitty, and I was freezing all day long. It was the senior's last day. =*( It was sad. In second hour, studio class (announcements), we were all hugging goodbye and everyone was just cryiiinngg!! =( Then we did the farewell announcements to seniors, and I was on PC, so it was weird, Ami and I were just crying, hehe. But hey, class of '04, we're seniors now! Good luck Sherry, I love you to pieces, you're a great girl, and I'll miss you.. don't forget about your Stiners! 

Other than that. Finals are next week..<br>1. English 11 CAI: That final should be easy.. I got mostly A's all year anyway.<br>2. Studio: Beyond easy... A+++, we just have to know what everything does behind the scenes, which we did for our midterm, and we just have to talk in front of the class about some stuff, easy!<br>3. Biology: ahhh, failure... I hate that class. This week, we've been dissecting rats, yum..<br>4. Algebra 2: might as well as slap a big F on there now.<br>5. Psychology: It should be easy if I know all the definitions and what not.. which I think I do, I did okay on all of the tests.<br>6. Spanish 2: ehhh, I dunno. I've been slacking in that class because I get so bored. We're taking our final in 3 parts.. Friday is the Dialog (#'s 1-6) test, I dunno how that's gonna go... I always blew off the dialogs. Either Friday after that or Monday is the verb conjugation test, ehh, that should be okay. Thennn Thursday during our actual final testing time, we're doing our speeches. We have to talk about our summer in espanol.. about 1 minute long, shouldn't be that bad.

I'm so glad it's almost summer time. One more week to go. It sure doesn't feel like summer though. It's cold and rainy, and yuuckk. But oh well, things can only get better right?

Goodbye Seniors '03
Good luck!!"

Our yearbooks are ugly.. but oh well. =\ I'm going to miss the seniors, I became pretty close with some of them.. good luck guys! Sherry, we better keep in touch!! Good luck sweetie!! But the good thing is that we're one step closer to graduating, one more year to go.. go 2004! ;)

So when I F'ed up my foot last Sunday, the doctor in the emergency room told me to stay off of it for awhile, keep icing it, and keep it elevated.. right? Ehhh. Do I ever listen? Nah. It's so painful to walk, and now I have shooting pains up to my knee. Ughhhh. I guess you could say that I learned my lesson, lol. Oh well. The 4 mile walk that Fernando and I went on last night probably didn't help much either. It felt okay while I was walking.. yeah, pain, but it wasn't that bad. It wasn't until I got home that it was KILLING me. Anyway. The walk was nice. I left around 10:30, Nando met up with me at the corner of my street. We walked down a mile.. then ending up walking to Green Acres (elementary school) and we played on the toys. Then we walked around all over, and finally we went home around 12:45. We walked about 4 miles, it was good. We just talked about everything, good stuff. =) 

Two more weeks of school. This week, we're probably going to be studying for finals in most of my classes, and in biology, we're dissecting a rat. Thenn next week consists of half days where we're taking our finals. SeNiOrS '04!!

I'm going to go take a shower, and get ready for the night! See ya!!"

* In kindergarten your idea of a good friend was the person who let you have the red crayon when all that was left was the ugly black one.

* In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls.

* In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully. 

* In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus.

* In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to switch square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck do-si-do-ing with Nasty Nicky or Smelly Susan.

* In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you.

* In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nicky or Susan, your new crush, and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed.

* In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had.

* In eighth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pack up your stuffed animals and old baseball but didn't laugh at you when you finished and broke out into tears.

* In ninth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who would go to a party thrown by a senior so you wouldn't wind up being the only freshman there.

* In tenth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who changed their schedule so you would have someone to sit with at lunch.

* In eleventh grade your idea of a good friend was the person who gave you rides in their new car, convinced your parents that you shouldn't be grounded, consoled you when you broke up with Nick or Susan, and found you a date to the prom.

* In twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pick out a college/university, assured you that you would get into that college/university, helped you deal with your parents who were having a hard time adjusting to the idea of letting you go...

* At graduation your idea of a good friend was the person who was crying on the inside but managed the biggest smile one could give as they congratulated you.

* The summer after twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you clean up the bottles from that party, helped you sneak out of the house when you just couldn't deal with your parents, assured you that now that you and Nick or you and Susan were back together, you could make it through anything, helped you pack up for university and just silently hugged you as you looked through blurry eyes at 18 years of memories you were leaving behind, and finally on those last days of childhood, went out of their way to give you reassurance that you would make it in college as well as you had these past 18 years, and most importantly sent you off to college knowing you were loved. 

* Now, your idea of a good friend is still the person who gives you the Better of the two choices, holds your hand when you're scared, helps you fight off those who try to take advantage of you, thinks of you at times when you are not there, reminds you of what you have forgotten, helps you put the past behind you but understands when you need to hold on to it a little longer, stays with you so that you have confidence, goes out of their way to make time for you, helps you clear up your mistakes, helps you deal with pressure from others, smiles for you when they are sad, helps you become a better person, and most importantly likes and understand you!"

"event","So this weekend was overall pretty good. I went to the Early November concert with Rick on Friday night. There was two other bands, Fallout Boy and View From The Top, or something like that, there also. We missed Fallout Boy, but we heard a couple of songs from View From The Top.. they were pretty good. Early November was good. The concert was at Shorty's (?), a bar in a scary neighborhood, haha. It was good though, I felt a little out of place there, but it's okay. Sooo we came home, picked up Nando and Amanda, and headed for up north to my other house. It was so fun. We got there, started to watch a movie, we fell asleep, then headed up the stairs to go to bed after awhile. Saturday, we drove into town, did some shopping and got ice cream, just hung out. We came back to the house, walked around the woods and showed them around. We watched another movie that night, fell asleep. Woke up on Sunday, Amanda and I searched for worms under all of the rocks, lol, and got a bunch of little tiny worms, to go fishing. That was fun. We didn't catch any fish though, haha. The river was really high from all of the rain, and the current was really fast. Hmmm, then we went back into town. We walked around on the beach, on the pier, it was sooo pretty. =) I think that was my favorite part of the weekend. Hmm, came back home, went fishing some more, took a nice long walk in the woods, played a little ""hide and seek"", lol. Well, after dinner, around 10:00ish, Amanda and I decided to watch a movie and just chill. The boys went out for a walk, WITHOUT a flashlight or a walkie talkie, and it was getting dark. I fell asleep during the movie.. Amanda woke me up after it, and we were wondering where the boys went.. it had been 2 hours since they left. We decided to just hope they'd come home soon, it was PITCH ass dark outside.. we went upstairs to bed. A few minutes later, my mom ran up the stairs, screaming at us and asking us where the boys were. She was getting pissed because she wanted to go to bed and they weren't home yet. It was reallly dark, and they've never been up there before. So I ran down the stairs with Amanda behind me, and I skipped the last 3 steps (it was dark, I'm the idiot that doesn't turn a light on) and I fell.. and I twisted my left foot. My mom left to go find the boys. She came back with them about 5-10 minutes later. I was still laying there crying my eyes out. They all stood around me, just watching me and trying to comfort me, haha, it was bad. I was crying my eyes out, and just trying to keep the humor going, I was saying the stupidest shit. I guess you really had to be there. ""I can't pimp my hoes anymore."" and all of the other wack shit I said. Thenn I got dragged to the emergency room. If you know me at all, you'll know I HATE doctors and hospitals more than anything in the world. I was just crying my eyes out and swearing my head off the whole time. The doctor was hairy and dumb, but he had nice blue eyes, hahaha. The lady who took my x-rays was a complete bitch. Sooo now I have a nicely wrapped up foot, and a pair of crutches, wahoo.. can you sense my excitement?

Well, tomorrow is my birthday. (5-27) This shall be interesting huh? Happy Birthday to me. 

I'm going to go finish typing up my psychology, I'll write more later, see ya."

Yes, immature, I know.. but if you only knew how much hatred is in that classroom, then you'd understand. Oh well. And I'm showing insubordination (spelling?) and immaturity. Ughhh!!

7. This project is definitely going nowhere.
8. I feel too stressed and overwhelmed during the week, then the weekend goes by TOO fast.
9. I'm feeling ugly lately.
10. I feel like I'm disappointing everyone.. and that I'm not good enough.
11. I don't understand a lot of my school work anymore. 
12. Or maybe.. maybe it's just that I'm giving up on myself.

<b>GOOD</b>
1. I went shopping today with an old friend that I hardly ever get to see. 
2. He bought me a birthday present.
3. My birthday is in 8 days. (May 27)
3. Friday is the Early November concert with Rick.
4. Rick and I are doing very good.
5. A bunch of good friends and I are leaving Friday night after the concert to go up to my other house for Memorial Day weekend to just relax and have fun.
6. School is almost over.
7. Summer is almost here.

Notice how most of my goods are sometime within the future.. whether days or weeks.. hmmm... let's hope for brighter days. ~Stina"

In an attempt to corner Vegeta-san and get him under control, Gohan-san, his father, and Yamcha-san are going to lead Vegeta-san away from the city, where he can do damage freely and not hurt anyone else. As such, it's best if you all stay <i>inside</i> of the city and tend to your wounded. I'll be trailing behind them to make sure their area is blocked off.

I don't know, Vegeta-san!

You look pretty scrawny for someone who claims to be the prince of a bunch of weird monkey people! Dyeing your hair doesn't really change much! Trust me, I've seen it up close!"

For anyone who was on the escort team, I need all of you on board for this. There are several parties already out there and on-site near where the satellite was, and we need to head out as well. 

As for anyone else, we need to be organized, working together, and more than anything -- <i>we need to stay calm</i>. Who is out there right now, and who is wiling to go out and help whether it involved transporting the injured, caring for them on the spot, or helping out at the clinic? 

I hear that there are doctors out in the field to help, but if there are any to spare, it would be best for the rest of that team to stay in the clinic so that we can clear the area of the injured and keep them in a more concentrated space, where they'll be able to receive better care and more monitored rest. And for anyone else who <i>isn't</i> trained in a medical field, I think it's best to have extra help at the clinic, and I'm more than sure that the doctors will need any help that they can get. 

Since the clinic is located in the high school, that is where I'll be taking any of the injured that I find! I'll be going back and forth between the two locations, so if anyone needs an extra hand in escorting the injured, please, do not hesitate to ask!"

While I'm unsure of just how violent these new creatures are, I'm volunteering to help anyone who needs it. If you're stranded, unarmed, or just need help getting to a safer place, do <i>not</i> hesitate to contact me. 

On that note, anyone who is willing to do the same should probably let everyone else know as well--and contact me, because if you're closer to someone than I am, I'll probably need your help. 

Outside of the residential area, the high school, and the church.. are there any other places that can serve as temporary shelters in case of an infestation? This city is <i>not</i> small, and I'm sure a few of you know a lot more about safer shelters than I do. 

Also, if anyone's dealt with these things before, I'd really appreciate any information on it. <s>They're apparently dead, but they're not hollows.. and they're not spirits. I don't understand!</s>

Everyone else, please, stay inside and don't provoke them.

Hey folks... Back and thrown off.  Haven't updated in a while, so let me fill ya in on whats been up.  Bike's still busted and I was supposed to get it fixed last tuesday.  But, that never happened considering my cousin and my great grandmother decided to visit.  Ah well, on the bright side I'm getting it fixed this tuesday so it shouldn't be a problem.

Speaking of broken things, my home computer decided to crap out on me after I decided to clean it.  I've been trying to fix it for a week now and no such luck.  First it was the power supply that blew, then it was the processor over heating to about 400 degrees (Set on fry), then it was the mother board not getting any power to the sector that provides the video and such, then it was the power supply again, and finally after spending about $180 dollars to get replacement parts the hard drive craps out and dies.  I don't know what the complete damage is, but I'm praying I can extract all the data off of it and stick it on a replacement hard drive.  This whole predicament makes me wish I backed up everything on a constant basis.  Which I'm going to do from now on, after I get EVERYTHING back to normal and working again.

As for the bike, which I'm really beginning to regret buying now, is still sitting out in the parking lot looking old and busted.  The gasket is still broken, it has no oil in the gear shaft due to my tinkering around with it, some of the parts are rusted, and I have a brown recluse (spider) living in the seat.  So when I get it taken into a shop on tuesday after work I'm going to try and take care of much as possible, especially the spider!  I hate spiders, HATE!  Still have to get my license, inspection, license plate, and a helmet before it becomes street worthy though.

Finally, whats throwing me off the most would be my great grandmother and my cousin visiting.  I love them and all, and they're the only two that I'm related to that I would allow through my door, but I can't stand them for too long before I start reverting back to before my issues with Lupe.  No responsibility and a lot of arguments.

My cousin's growing up way too fast and she's turning into one of those over prepped kids that you see on T.V. and it makes me worried.  What makes me feel bad was that the fact that we grew up together and after two years of me being gone I just show up again in her life and we're both different that what we were used to.

My Great Grandmother on the other hand is still as she was as she has always been.  Loving, but persistent.  She came over and decided to clean my house, which was nice but not needed.  I wanted to take care of her and treat her to my hospitality, but she insisted that I sit back and let her do the work.  I don't know about you, but that happens to bug me big time.  She's always supported me and taught me a lot of what I know when it comes to taking care of myself,  but I really wanted to show her that I could do it myself and have her as a guest.  But oh well, it's my great grand mother and I still love her, even if she still see's me as the chubby 12 year old she's loved all these years.

Yeah... So there's whats throwing me off.  Broken machines and rubbing elbows.  Actually... Whats throwing me way off is the fact that I haven't been talking to Blade like I always do... My comp being down has messed up the usual schedule that we see each other at.  Whenever I talk with him or play online with him, I feel happier than I usually do.  I kinda... No, I just miss him.  It's not I have a thing for him, but he's like one of those best friends that without him life sucks."

"event","I finally got myself a motorcycle!!!  I bought myself a 1975 Honda 100XL for $600 dollars, from this old guy who was clearing out his garage.  To tell you the truth it's a piece of junk on two wheels, but it's my piece of junk on two wheels.  When I first got it it ran fine, but when I brought it home and cleaned it a little it wouldn't want to start.  Now for some reason, after letting it sit out in the rain, it runs perfectly and without a hitch.  Now the only thing left to do with it is renew the registration, replace a couple of parts, get my license, and customize it to the point where it looks beautiful.  It's going to be quite a bit of work to be honest, but at least I'm going to have some fun doing it...  Except for my wallet anyways.


So here she is folks, the actual bike:

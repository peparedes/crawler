"event","As most of you know, I just finished up my PhD and am getting ready to start a fabulous job at Texas A&amp;M in the Fall. It's been crazy getting the dissertation finished and preparing for the move. But I have a couple nerdy academic things to share. First, I am officially published! One of my articles came out last month in Anthropological Quarterly. Available for download <a href=""http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/anthropological_quarterly/v081/81.2.vora.html"">here</a> if you have a university subscription to the journal (I can email you a pdf if you can't get it)<br /><br />Also, I just wrote a guest entry on higher education in the Gulf for the wonderful Global Higher Education blog. You can find that <a href=""http://globalhighered.wordpress.com/2008/06/25/globalized-higher-education-uae/"">here</a>. I highly recommend this blog and find the writing and research to be excellent.<br /><br />Since some of you are the wonderful ""informants"" that made this possible, I would love to hear your feedback, either here or privately. <br /><br />All my thanks for everyone's support so far! I have a feeling posting will be on hold for a while, but hopefully, I'll have more to report once I get settled in Texas!"

"event","Geez. What is it with undergrads and their inability to use words properly (and their inability to write professional emails, the subject of a future rant)? I got an email today asking me about what Indian expats in Dubai do on ""there day off"" and whether ""they enjoy there life in Dubai."" Every quarter, after grading the first set of papers or tests, I have to do a little lesson on the difference between it's and its; and on the difference between they're, there, and their; among other things. To students in a competitive university! This says a lot about the state of education in the US, I guess, but also points to a general laziness among students in their (notice the use of that word) writing and communication styles. Oh, well. I sound like a geezer, and one of my most beloved professors recently wrote on one of my dissertation chapters, ""learn how to use a comma,"" so I guess I am no better. (Please feel free to point out improper comma use and general bad grammar in this post if you would like, btw.)

End rant.

PS - Students, if you want me to answer your emails, learn my name, dammit! I am not Nora, Voran, Vera, or whatever the name of the other South Asian TA that quarter happens to be!

Ok. seriously. end rant."

"event","Hi all. Or perhaps I should say y'all. or actually ""all y'all,"" which is, according to trivial pursuit, the official plural of y'all. Anyway, the point of the post: I wanted to let everyone know that my job hunt has been successful and as of the fall, I will be Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Women's Studies at Texas A&amp;M University. Texas is a bit freaky (but I think I have a lot of preconceived notions since when I visited everyone was quite normal and actually very happy living and working at A&amp;M). But I am so happy the crazy job search is over, and that I actually did pretty well for my first time out (and ABD as well - that's ""all but dissertation"" for you non-academics). Anyway, I'll still keep up the blog, and still keep up research in the Gulf, so stay tuned. I'm excited for the next phase of this crazy academic life! Now I just gotta finish that darn dissertation, which is pretty much done, but still..."

"event","Funny. I was thinking this morning about a post I wanted to write about anthropology's inadvertent complicity with state projects of exclusion in the way they define the boundaries of national populations in knowledge production (more on that at a later date), when I came across this from Reuters:<br /><br /><i>The latest tactic in Iraq: anthropology<br /><br />By Peter Graff Wed Jan 9, 8:08 AM ET<br /><br />As David Matsuda tells it, he's probably the last person you'd expect to see in a U.S. military uniform climbing out of an &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; armored vehicle in Iraq.<br /><br />An anthropology professor from the East Bay campus of California State University near San Francisco, he's a self-described &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peacenik who opposed the war in Iraq, did his academic research in Guatemala and never carries a gun.<br /><br />""I'm a Californian. I'm a liberal. I'm a Democrat,"" he says. ""My impetus is to come here and help end this thing.""<br /><br />Matsuda is part of the U.S. military ""Human Terrain Team"" (HTT) program, which embeds anthropologists with combat &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brigades in Iraq and Afghanistan in the hope of helping tactical commanders in the field understand local cultures.<br /><br />The program is controversial: the American Anthropological Association denounced it in October, saying it could lead to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ethics being compromised, the profession's reputation damaged, and worst of all, research subjects becoming military &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; targets.<br /><br />Matsuda says the concern is based on a misunderstanding of what he has signed on to do.<br /><br />""There's been a knee-jerk reaction in the anthropology community, that you've been co-opted, that you're a warmonger, like &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're clubbing baby seals or something,"" he said. ""I came here to save lives, to make friends out of enemies.""<br /><br />Soldiers in northeastern Baghdad -- an area transformed over the past year from one of the most violent parts of Iraq to one &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the best illustrations of the security improvements of late 2007 -- say they are grateful for Matsuda's expertise as they &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make the transition from fighting to peacemaking.<br /><br />VIOLENT STRONGHOLD<br /><br />""It's a huge asset,"" said Staff Sergeant Dustin ""Boogie"" Brueggemann who, as a tactical psychological operations specialist, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has spent the past year trying to win hearts and minds in Adhamiya, until a few months ago one of the most violent &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strongholds of Sunni Arab militants in Iraq.<br /><br />""The guys who were out with him were saying: 'Dr Matsuda's so smart!' Soldiers even on the lowest level now, we see the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; big picture just by listening to him talk,"" he said.<br /><br />""He gave me so much information that had I known it a year ago I could have done things differently,"" he said. ""He gave me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a history of the Ubaidi tribe. A lot of people here are members of that tribe. I knew a little bit about them, but I didn't realize &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just how big they were.""<br /><br />Further up the command chain, Lieutenant-Colonel David Oclander, deputy commander of the 5,000 soldiers of the 2nd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division, said Matsuda had given a presentation on how Iraqis resolve conflicts &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that proved valuable in approaching Shi'ite clerics.<br /><br />""The HTT has been a great help in making sure that when we dialogue with them, we dialogue with them in a way they &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; understand and appreciate,"" he said.<br /><br />Matsuda says he arrived at exactly the right time, when a sudden sharp decline in violence opened new opportunities for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engagement in his unit's area.<br /><br />The brigade is a classic example of last year's new U.S. strategy in Iraq that saw greater numbers of troops deployed to Iraq &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and more emphasis on interaction with civilians.<br /><br />Before the troop buildup, the entire area of northeastern Baghdad -- including about half of the capital's population -- was &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; covered by just a single battalion of about 800 U.S. troops who suffered some of the worst casualties in Iraq.<br /><br />SADR CEASEFIRE<br /><br />Now the area is covered by the brigade's six battalions, including four combat battalions each covering separate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neighborhoods as diverse as Sunni Arab stronghold Adhamiya and Sadr City, the giant Shi'ite slum of more than 2 million &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people.<br /><br />In the past six months violence plummeted, as Adhamiya's Sunni tribal leaders turned against al Qaeda militants, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moqtada al Sadr, the Shi'ite cleric whose Mehdi Army militia controls Sadr City, declared a ceasefire.<br /><br />In December 2006, there were 450 killings in the area, mostly by sectarian death squads trying to drive rival groups out of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their neighborhoods. There were just 15 killings last month, mainly by ordinary criminals, said Oclander.<br /><br />On Saturday, Matsuda -- wearing a U.S. military uniform but unarmed -- spent two hours with soldiers from 3rd Squadron, 7th &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cavalry lingering on a street in Adhamiya where a few months ago U.S. forces would have had to fight either in or out.<br /><br />They meandered in and out of shops, bought falafel sandwiches and ate them on a street corner while playing with local &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children who already seemed to know their names. Periodically they knocked on doors and asked permission to come &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inside homes for a chat. They never turned down an offer of tea.<br /><br />Most of local people were friendly, although they complained about a lack of electricity and their suspicion of the Shi'ite-led &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; government and its security forces.<br /><br />Matsuda said he had learned a lot that day -- about who was moving into vacant houses and who was renting them out, how &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a local clinic got its medicines, how shop owners were getting funding to reopen their shops.<br /><br />""We have a window of opportunity here to make a difference for these people. We have to take it,"" he said.<br /><br />(Editing by Andrew Dobbie)</i><br /><br /><br />As the article mentions, there has been a strong reaction to the involvement of anthropologists with the military from within the community (it was a major topic of discussion at the Anthropology meetings in DC in December). I'm not sure I know where I stand on this one. It is definitely very complicated. How does one assess help and harm in these situations? How is information collected by anthropologists used? I think it's also interesting and necessary to place this in the context of anthropology's historical entanglement with colonialism and imperial states. It's not a new thing to use anthropologists as part of the apparatus of governance. Today a lot of old-school anthropology seems naive at best and racist at worst, but many anthropologists thought that by humanizing the ""natives,"" they were reducing violence against them. And maybe this is true. But in many cases, anthropological ""data"" was used to justify colonial rule and define cultural traditions in ways that negatively impacted people. So it's a tough call. But it's not some new trend, like this article makes it seem. The US government used anthropologists regularly as part of its expansionist campaigns in the Philippines and the South Pacific, for example. Any way, interesting stuff. Feel free to comment and get a discussion going!"

"event","Hi all. The reason I have not been posting is because job season is high upon us here in the ivory tower (which is actually more like a cement parking structure at UCI, but hey, whatever). I have to date applied for over 50 jobs. Yup, that's right. My advisor's motto is ""never turn down a job you don't have yet,"" meaning apply everywhere and don't be a diva about it. Wise words, since one of the rejection letters I received recently noted that they had over 250 applicants for the position! We are talking c.o.m.p.e.t.i.t.i.v.e. Now that the holidays are approaching and most places are already on break, I probably won't hear anything until 2008. I've been happy with the number of preliminary interviews I have gotten so far, but could you all root for me (even though you know I don't believe in all that karmic/cosmic stuff)? But, hey, if it gets me a good job in a good place, hello Jebus!"

"event","I know, I haven't posted in a really long time, so I am bombarding you with the second of the day. Maybe that makes up for it a little bit:<br /><br />Over at the UAE community, <a href=""http://uaecommunity.blogspot.com/2007/11/bloggers-take-note.html"">people are talking about American researcher Syed Ali's experience</a> of being detained, having his research data confiscated, and then being immediately deported from Dubai in 2006. As a fellow researcher of Dubai (and one whose work is on the sometimes-controversial issue of Asian migration to the Gulf), this event inspired a bit of fear in me, and made me a little more ambivalent about my research site. But, I also have started to think that people tend to exceptionalize the Gulf too much...<br /><br />So, my question, and I hope to get a good discussion going here, is to academics, researchers, and journalists in general - what kinds of negotiations do you face in your research, in terms of dealing with governmental authorities and restrictions, limitations on freedom of speech, and issues of personal safety? How do you manage to maneuver around these things? Have you experienced any adverse situations in your research sites, or in your ""home"" sites? Do you exercise self-censorship? How? And what other strategies do you deploy to balance your research with the limitations imposed by the location of research? <br /><br />OK, that is actually many questions. I have posted my own ways of dealing with some of this before, but others, please respond! I'm interested in the overlaps between the Gulf as a research site and other places."

The only downside was how little time we had, especially in Cairo, which I fell in love with. We also were ina group with my parents and three Indian couple friends of theirs, which made for some interesting moments...<br /><br />Where to next? How can one top Egypt?

"event","Wow. I did not realize how long it's been since my last post. sorry. I've been super busy with job applications. So, if any of my readers still exist, here's something that's come up in the last few days that I have been pondering:

So I posted a conference announcement on a popular Gulf listserv that caters mostly to academics and policy folks. The conference is focused on the GCC and for most of my announcement I said either GCC or ""Gulf Arab States,"" but I guess I slipped in an ""Arabian Gulf"" as well. Well, some Iranian scholar found that offensive enough to email me in order to educate me that the proper term is Persian Gulf and that to not use it is a distortion of history and a denial of who it actually belongs to (belongs? since when, post-imperialism, do entire bodies of water ""belong"" to a country? oh yeah, and last I checked ""Persia"" is not a country). OK, well I passed it off as just some random person with too much investment in identity politics, but then I started poking around a little and learned that 1. if you type Arabian Gulf into Google, the first listing you get is a google bomb about how there is no such thing, and 2. that apparently when National Geographic used the term a couple years ago in an article (in which the also used Persian Gulf interchangeably) it caused such a backlash that they eventually had to recant. 

To me this is all a bit weird. Both terms are so laden with Orientalist history and British colonial involvement in the region that I really don't think any are innocuous or ""proper."" I personally use Arabian Gulf as one of the few ways I know to distinguish that I am talking about the Arab side of the Gulf, and namely the GCC countries, who have similarities in terms of history, economic development, social change, etc, that are very different from Iran and Iraq. (thus the two words ""Arabian Gulf"" are a way to shorthand that whole last sentence). As a scholar of the ""Gulf"" I also find that Gulf Studies often gets overrun by academics who study Iran and Iraq, so this is my way of carving out a space for us, the GCC-focused people. Also, the GCC governments, and the people who live there, use the term, so I guess I am used to it.

So really, do you all think that this is a big deal? I personally feel like the Iranian scholars and activists that seem to care tend to be invested in some notion of a ""Persian"" cultural history that separates them from the current situation in Iran and includes within it a desire to distinguish themselves from ""Arabs,"" which I think can be plenty problematic, esp. here in Socal where the very active Iranian diaspora community is often in support of Bush's imperialistic policies in the Middle East, including support of potential military action in Iran. Anyway, just my initial thoughts on what apparently is a huge can of worms which I inadvertently stumbled upon but probably should have known about by now..."

"event","No, this is not an interesting post about American military empire-building in the name of ""freedom."" Sorry. It is rather a very neurotic post about the academic job market. Yes, a snoozefest to most of you, but the cause of many sleepless nights and stomach aches for me lately. See, I am about to go on the job market. While tenured jobs in academia are probably the only remaining places of guaranteed job security left in the country, the academic job market is probably the most insecure place one could be if they were unemployed. I don't know what other disciplines are like, but anthropology is notoriously difficult. I know people who have had their PhD for several years and have been lecturing for a pittance, getting rejected cycle after cycle. And there is no rhyme or reason to the thing. And of course now I am going to be competing with these people who have years more teaching experience than me, and probably a lot of publications and grants as well.

You never know if they choose based on your letter, your area of expertise, who your advisor is, or whether they know your name through some network. And you never really know what your professors are saying about you and whether they are representing your work in their rec letters accurately.

So basically, I have 2 pages to sum up the last 5 years of my life in a way that makes my dissertation that nobody but me cares about stand out from 200 other dissertations that nobody but their authors care about. Oh, and I have to devise syllabi for classes that don't exist, write a teaching philosophy (what?!), and pull together three chapters of the dissertation that are good enough to send out as writing samples. Arrgh. 

I am NOT prepared for not getting a job. The thought of living in Irvine for even one more year, of lecturing boring classes and making no money, it is just too depressing. And it is not fair. In most other jobs (and all of the other ones I have had) if you are good and you work your ass off you can get ahead. In this market, plenty of great people get nothing and plenty of people who don't know how to teach or even write have tenure-track jobs. Again, no rhyme or reason.

And the scariest part of all is that I LOVE being an academic. I cannot imagine doing anything else. I love teaching, I love writing, I love being a nerd. And I think that my discipline is greatly lacking work on the Gulf. And I think I am pretty good at what I do.

I'm not willing to let it go, and I'm not sure if I have the capability of weathering years of failure. And that is the insecurity of job security."

"event","So those of you on the blogosphere have heard and shared several stories about the difficulties and special considerations surrounding doing research and teaching in the Gulf. I feel like as a researcher I self-censor way more than I would while in the states and that I am constantly looking over my shoulder. These paranoias are actually more self-induced than real, I think. Firings and deportations of academics are very few and far between. But still, I conduct research differently there than I would in the states, and use different word choices, etc. But I never really thought that this feeling extended out from the Gulf into academics in general that focus on Gulf issues. I know, sounds naive, but I do still for the most part live inside a bubble of academic freedom. 

Last week I participated in a Gulf Studies conference at Exeter University in England. And I found a lot of interesting politics, mainly revolving two themes, 1. the issue of academic freedom vs. ruling family interests, and 2. gender issues. A few thoughts on each:

1. First, the Sheikh of Sharjah is the single largest benefactor in the history of Exeter University, and has pretty much funded the Islamic and Arabic Institute which hosted the conference. HH flew in from Sharjah just to open the conference and a new wing in the institute building, stayed for one panel, and then flew back. What I found so interesting is the whole pomp and ceremony around his presence. First, we were told by the conference organizer not to use the ""loo"" upstairs because it would look bad to be emerging from the bathroom when the sheikh arrived. Then we all gathered to watch the ceremony in which he cut the ribbon for the new wing and number of speeches about his generosity and intelligence were given. And then we resumed the conference, during which the shiekh proceeded to speak loudly with a professor throughout the next panel. He also found a paper presented by a grad student on UAE's economy problematic, because the title said UAE but was focused on Dubai. This is fine, but the manner in which he commented on this was not. He never addressed the woman directly, instead speaking to the room and saying things like, ""she must have been misled"". And he continued for a good two minutes or so. The poor grad student. She handled it famously, but still. Can you imagine giving a paper on housemaids, labor issues, or censorship in the Gulf in a forum such as this? I would be mortified. In fact, I had a few things in my paper which I was giving the next day that I changed because I was then worried about whether I could say certain things, regardless of the fact that the sheikh flew back to Sharjah after sitting in on just that one panel. Still, there was a feeling of self-censorship in the room, and I wonder how to get around this, especially when ruling family money is so often tied up with Gulf Studies programs and initiatives in the West. 

2. And the gender issue was SO irritating, especially when you consider the very interesting old boys' club that is produced when you put a bunch of older Arab male scholars together with a bunch of older white English ones. This group of ""uncles"" as I have chosen to call them displayed some incredibly professional behavior, including hitting on female grad students, addressing women on panels as ""lovely ladies,"" speaking throughout panels on women or by women (if they attended at all), and touting the physical virtues of Filipinas&nbsp; to the whole room in a Q&amp;A session. Not only is the professionalism that should come along with an academic conference missing here, but so is the treatment of women scholars as equals. And, the academic focus on gender issues in the Gulf was also very little. I am extremely interested in organizing a conference on feminist gulf studies, with scholars from the Gulf and other parts of the world, and hopefully people who focus on policy and women's rights issues as well. That would be very interesting. 

OK, I think I have said all there is to say at this point. Oh, there is one more thing, and I am going to keep chewing on it: academics of the Gulf are usually experts in either citizen issues or expatriate ones, and they usually find they know little about the group they do not focus on (I am guilty of this myself). So aren't we also reproducing the citizen/expat divide through our knowledge production? Something to think about.

And, lest it sound like the conference sucked, it very much did not. There were some stellar papers and I learned a lot about the Gulf as a whole. I get so mired in the UAE, and Dubai in particular, that I tend to forget that things are very different in each Gulf country. The exchange of ideas and information both in the formal setting of the panels and the informal setting of meals was immense. And I did find a few like minds to discuss the above frustrations and concerns with."

"event","So, a week from now I will be sitting in my cramped BA seat and drinking as many free bad cocktails as possible -- on my way to Dubai! It was such a wonderful and awful year living there last year, both at the same time. And I feel like I was such a different person there than I am at home (and have become such a different person for having had the opportunity to live there). I have no idea what to expect on this trip, my first post-fieldwork trip to Dubai. 

I have so many mixed feelings, so many things I miss, and so many things the distance from Dubai has made me dislike even more. So I am excited but also a bit nervous. I miss being so in touch with Indian culture, Bollywood, Indian food, using Hindi on a daily basis, not being the only brown one, and also, despite all the leering, I felt incredibly safe living by myself in Dubai, safer than I have ever felt in any city. But the distance from Dubai has made the insane segregation and discrimination between nationalities and races there seem so intolerable, even though I tolerate similar things here, and even though I got so easily accustomed to it when I was there. I am not ready to deal with Western expats who feel perfectly entitled to make three times more money than similarly qualified Asians, white people who won't talk to me at parties (yes, I have experienced this as an American in Dubai, and NEVER in the US, although there is definitely a ton of racism here), 100 degree weather at night but still needing a sweater in the mall, no real public spaces that don't require money, the crazy level of consumerism (which, again, I so easily enjoy after a short time living in it), cab drivers that try to convert me to Islam, and in general people who think I am stupid or a prostitute because I happen to have a uterus and not cover my head. 

But the thing is, for all of you reading this and thinking that ""oh, but she thinks the US is so much better,"" I don't. Actually my entire dissertation is an argument AGAINST how much Western academics treat the Middle East and Islam as exceptional, outside of their perceived norms of late capitalism and modern state formations. In fact, living in Dubai taught me a lot about how similar Dubai and the US are. But they are also very different. And here is the thing - there are power differentials and ridiculously frustrating things everywhere, but the place you are becomes normal and other places so easy to criticize. 

So my trip to Dubai is a bit scary -- will I feel like an insider or an outsider? Will the things I have been writing about for 6 months hold true when I am there, or do they only seem true from a distance? And the scariest thing, will I hate it and never want to come back? Because I have to admit hating it much more now that I am not there and thinking about it from a distance than when I was immersed in it. But I also feel so nostalgic, like I never have about any other place. These contradictory feelings are what makes writing a dissertation with integrity difficult. Nothing is black and white, and if people represent places that way, they are taking the easy route. How to turn the complicated, contradictory, and confusing emotions and data I have into an argument that holds together and also holds true to my experiences? 

It is a very exciting and scary place to be, thinking about going back to a place that I have basically been creating through my writing for six months. What will the relationship be between my production of Dubai over the past six months (and ALL knowledge is produced) and my experience of Dubai after six months away? I guess we will find out soon enough..."

"event","So, all of you know I have been lamenting (ok, bitching) about having no research funding, no guaranteed job prospects, and $15K a year salary. But, this week my hubbs and I had a fantastic revelation. It costs like 100K to raise a kid to 18, and insanely more to pay for private liberal arts colleges that end up doing nothing but providing much needed bisexual and drug experiences (believe me, I KNOW). So, compared to the thousands and thousands you breeders out there are going to spend, what's a $2000 fendi bag, or an HDtv? So, as of this moment (and even more so when I actually get a real job), Ed and I are officially spending our non-existent kids' inheritance. And for all of you that want to judge me on buying $300 shoes, at least I am not breeding another ugly American that is going to drain the world's resources and perpetuate my well-established sense of capitalist entitlement. And, of course, make the awful experience of flying coach even more unbearable.

Oh, so here's my big baby news -- I brought home my first Manolos today! Yes it was hard squeezing them on, and I spent many hours in nordstrom's with my feet in the air, but it was all worth it when I stared into their beautiful suede lining. And I can't tell you the maternal separation anxiety I felt when the shoe man took them away to waterproof them. It was like a piece of myself had been ripped out. But now they are home and safely stored away in their individual felt bags.

You can all congratulate me by buying me something off of my registries--anything at gucci, pucci, prada,hermes, fendi, bottega, and ferragamo (although I will accept the occasional Dolce, YSL, and Chloe).

And those of you worried about Ed's stake in all this, he will be getting any electronic stuff he desires, his own music studio, and a bookcase full of porn (and of course, a cigar--which may or may not actually be a cigar)."

"event","So , I thought that I was adjusting to being in my thirties, There are a bunch of things to adjust to: sagging boobs (thank goodness not even enough that my husband notices), the need to buy eye cream and sunscreen, and the fact that losing even one pound takes 17 hours of cardio. Oh yeah, and the fact that I have no job and no real guarantee that I will have one even after I get my PhD. But today brought it all to a new level. My dad informed me that my uncle passed away suddenly and that an auntie (those of you who are desi will know that this has nothing to do with blood relations) just had a stroke and is unconscious. Add to that the fact that my husband's grandmother was just diagnosed with cancer, my nanny has severe asthma and diabetes, and I only have one grandparent left... I am just starting to realize that death is becoming so much more of a reality in my life that I need to learn how to deal with it. And figuring out how to do that is a bit daunting. Thank goodness Ed and I have healthy parents and that is very far away. Those of you in your twenties: be happy that you don't have to deal with this at such a big level yet. And. wear a bra! Believe me, I went to a hippy college and then lived in San Francisco. The results of that are catching up with me. It ain't pretty. Well, it's still pretty fabulous, but we are definitrly going downhill."

"event","Hi everyone! I just got back from a much needed vacation in the Dominican Republic. Much needed, but I didn't get the rest and relaxation I required. I got a sinus infection on the plane which turned into a chest cold and aggravated my asthma so I had breathing problems the whole week, then I got a sunburn on the first day (yes, me, the one who used to tan for hours on my Dubai roof with no problems). Sunburns suck, but I am late to finding this out given my complexion. Anyway, it made me feel flu-y and it was hard to sleep and now I look like I have a skin disease. Then I guess all these issues and the fact that our resort didn't serve the best food made me have stomach problems for the second half of the trip, and finally we got to the airport to go home and found out that jet blue had cancelled our flight and nobody notified us! so that led to a lot of waiting around in the middle of the night at a deserted airport and getting hundreds of mosquito bites.

So now I am home and have gone to the doctor and gotten all the requisite meds and I actually feel more relaxed than I was last week. I even opened up a dissertation document and worked on it today! I am back in the saddle, but believe it or not, already have to plan my next trip.

I will be presenting a paper at a Gulf Studies conference in Exeter, England this July, and I figure that is a great excuse to make a short foray to Dubai at the same time. So, my plan is to be in DXB the last week of June. I know, it will be hot as hell, but I'll be at the pool during the day (this time with sunscreen!) and partying at night. But I also want to get some research done while I am there.

So readers, I have questions for you:

My Dubai party buddies - will you be around the last week of June and are you ready for some sleep deprivation and debauchery?

Bloggers - will you be around and willing to be interviewed (anonymously of course) about the UAE blog scene, censorship, free speech, etc.? 

Other citizens and expats - let me know if you would be into sitting for an interview. I love hearing about as many experiences of living in Dubai as possible.

And of course, as always, I am happy to answer any questions about the project, what I have been up to, etc. See you all soon!!

PS - Dominican Republic was real purty. I'll post photos soon that make it look like we had a joyously good time."

"event","A couple weekends ago, Ed and I just took off to a weird resort in Escondido, about an hour from our house. We went there because we wanted to get away and got a good deal, but we had no idea what was there, except for the fact that it was close to San Diego. Well, it is this super cute little town that seems to be going through a renaissance. Unfortunately the amazing looking crafts museum was closed while we were there, but Ed discovered this amazing little art installation in a very nondescript public park that truly is the most amazing place ever. It is done by an artist named Niki de Saint Phalle, and is called Queen Califia's Magical Circle. Basically, there are so many amazing things to se and so many angles that these pictures barely do it justice, but I thought I would share anyway. We took about a hundred pictures and I could have kept going. The whole thing is not even that big, but I could spend hours there. We also went to the San Diego wild animal park on this trip and did a bunch of wine tasting, but all pales in comparison.<br /><br />For any of you thinking of coming to visit us, we would be happy to take you in person:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00017cxq/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00017cxq/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00018ced/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00018ced/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00019573/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00019573/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001a8e3/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001a8e3/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001bde2/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001bde2/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001d46k/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001d46k/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001eesa/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001eesa/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001fpz4/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001fpz4/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001g22f/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001g22f/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001hkq8/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001hkq8/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001kahb/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001kahb/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001pz50/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0001pz50/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00014w5w/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00014w5w/s320x240"" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00015xhx/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00015xhx/s320x240"" /></a>"

"event","So, I have been moving along well with the dissertation. I now have two chapter drafts and am really enjoying the whole process of writing up. I think I am writing relatively good stuff too. However, I am starting to wonder how futile this career choice is for me. I got yet another fellowship rejection today (for those of you who don't know me that well, I am notoriously good at getting rejected for funding). I have finally found the thing I like to do most in the world and I can't imagine being anything but an academic for the rest of my life, but I never seem to get a break. I spent a year apart from my husband, emptied out our savings account, I owe my parents countless thousands of dollars, and all I keep hearing is how competitive the job market is for phd's. I now have no idea what I am going to do next year while I apply for jobs which I am seriously doubting I will get, given my track record. It is quite frustrating and depressing to love something and know that you are relatively good at it, but to deal with a constant stream of rejection. I wonder if this will ever change. I wonder if I will crack under the pressure. I wonder if it is worth it after all, especially since the monetary rewards are so nil even if I do get the job the first time around, or get funding for future research. Oh, well. Just needed to vent a little. Thanks for listening (I mean reading...)"

"event","Hello, dear readers (if there are readers left out there, that is). Sorry for the long absence. I have been busy writing up my field experiences. I even completed a chapter draft! Now I can officially say I am ""writing"" a dissertation, instead of planning to write one, so yay!

I just wrote about the UAE state and different projects of economic development, and the relationship between the state and different populations. The bulk of this chapter is about how the distinction between citizen and expat plays out on multiple levels.

Of course, since you never know your full argument during fieldwork (because you have no data), once you start formulating an argument, you realize there are major gaps of info that you need to fill in. I am in that situation, knowing very little about the UAE legal system, and especially about laws surrounding naturalization. I will begin the internet searches and all that asap, but I wanted to throw this question out to those of you in the UAE, or those of you who know people there:

-does anyone know an expat who has become a UAE citizen, or know of one? If so, please email me nehavora1 at gmail. 

As always all info you share will be anonymous. Also feel free to pass my info along to anyone who might have this kind of info, or any knowledge of naturalization procedures in the UAE.

Thanks!"

"event","I remember lying in my bed on election night 1984 and praying that Reagan won. I thought the world would end if he didn't and this nothing man-from-god-knows-where did (even though even at such a young age my budding feminist side was a bit psyched). I even had this mini slate board I used to write wishes on and put under my pillow, and I wrote my wish that Reagan would continue to be ""our"" president. ""Our"". I was ten years old. Such is the power of charisma. I also remember 1992, watching the nintendo war against Iraq, crying with my high school friends on the phone about the unjustness of the world. And for as far back as that, I remember Saddam. What he did or what he did not do, it did not matter to a 16 year old. He had charisma. He was familiar. He has been familiar for so long. He has shaped our generation and our understanding (or voluntary lack of understanding) of events in the last two decades. I did shed more than a tear when I read the news today. Why? If only for that - the charisma, the familiarity, the inability to understand a world without the figures I have known to shape it for my formative life. What is it about the personality? And how do we take it out of our politics, our ethics, and our beliefs? Why do I feel this way? Of course, I am against capital punishment, but why such a strong reaction when I had none to McVeigh and many others? I must brush up on my Weber (more charisma, in two ways), but really, no joke: what is going on here??? And why even at this not-so-innocent age am I faced with realizing that my (voluntary and fortunate) innocence was still there to some extent? Is it gone now that I recognize it? Part of me wishes so and part of me is too scared to face the world without it..."

"event","I laughed, I cried, I almost threw up, but I made it through! <a href=""http://www.troubador.co.uk/book_info.asp?bookid=275"">Dubai Creek</a> (discovered thanks to my friend Scott's flatmate Elliot) is supposed to give a glimpse of expat life in Dubai. The back cover describes it as ""A novel that combines travel fiction, social commentary and crime mystery."" Combines it with the most atrocious writing ever. Here are some choice bits from the book (preferably read out loud to friends while drinking, for maximum impact):<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""At no time did I find any evidence of police unfairness or mistreatment of prisoners or any general anti-western sentiment after 9/11""&nbsp; - preface<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""The food was great. It was a 'help yourself to as much as you like' international buffet"" - p. 21<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""All in all, she sparkled more than a Christmas tree dressed up with lights and tinsel. Her strong German accent and very loud voice pierced my eardrums and got on my nerves a bit, so I got away from her as quickly as I could.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was much happier when I bumped into Ani. Although, in my opinion, Filipino girls are not as obviously attractive as, say, Thai girls, Ani was a very pretty girl."" - p. 27<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Some time after I had decided that I did quite fancy Ani and wouldn't mind bonking her myself, I realized she was a little vain and quite full of herself."" - p. 28<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I glanced at my watch; it was 8.20 am. I waited, and waited. Eventually it was 8.30 am, then 8.40."" - p.54<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""From a girl's point of view I would have thought that Jas was a quite good-looking chap, it was just that he sometimes came across as a stuck-up pompous twat."" - p. 59<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""In fact, I had already noticed that two of the shopping centres on the 'beach road' spelt 'Jumeirah' differently: the Jumeira Centre left off the 'h', but the Jumeirah Plaza had it."" - p. 69<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Baron was a very attractive man. I can say that as a one hundred percent heterosexual man."" - p. 140<br /><br />Oh, and near the end, the first-person shifts to an entirely different character. Excellent! All in all, 56 AED well-spent. Thank you, McGrudy's.<br /><br />If you are really a masochist, I would suggest reading this book in conjunction with Robin Moore's <a href=""http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/robin-moore/dubai.htm"">Dubai</a> from the 1970's, although this one is harder to find (banned in Dubai and out of print in US -- I got it out of UC library storage). Moore's book is not quite as bad (or good!), but gives you a sense of Dubai's pre-independence smuggling heyday. Both novels can be treated as narrative ""artefacts"" in terms of my research, so I needed to read them, but I hope you all appreciate what I went through in order to provide you with this amusement (and if you don't find those quotes hilarious, I might have to disown you!)"

"event","Hi, everyone. I am back in the states, not yet at my home in Cali, but at my folks' in NJ. During the flight back and my final days in Dubai, the permanency of my departure did not really sink in. Sure I got a bit misty saying goodbye to folks, but I did not go up to my fabulous apartment rooftop for a last look even once before moving out, and I really had no list of Dubai must-visit places to see one final time. But here, in the cold of NJ, a little depression is starting to sink in. The question is, why? During my second dose of Dubai living, I pretty much started to dislike the place. I was getting tired of men staring no matter what I was wearing, tired of the traffic, tired of how difficult it was to find taxis, tired of how expensive it was to go out, disgusted by the racism, disturbed by the nonstop construction and the conditions of construction workers, angry at the censorship of internet sites, angry at the inane discussions on 7 days, annoyed at Jumeirah Janes and license plates and screaming expat children. And yet here I am, transitioning with difficulty, missing my horribly uncomfortable bed in my sterile apartment with no TV while sitting in the most comfortable bed in my parents' guest bedroom, surfing the internet with no blocked sites, an extremely fast connection, and cable.

Will I ever be able to deal with change? And what is my love/hate relationship with Dubai all about? It is this love and hate, and the passion with which I feel both, I think, that is at the core of my ethnographic, not just personal, experience in Dubai. Now, I will take a bit of time to come to terms with being back in my fabulous real life (why is that so hard to deal with?) and then hope that my brain kicks back into nerdy goddess mode. Inshallah this dissertation will start to take shape soon.

Happy holidays to all. And thank you SO much to my cousin and the good friends I have in Dubai for making a lonely girl feel at home..."

"event","So much has happened in the last few weeks. Fortunately or unfortunately, none of it research-related. I finally have an opportunity to show off some pics, though! Where to begin? Being uncreative as I am, I will go chronologically.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. I had to say goodbye to Taz :(. I miss her like crazy but thanks to Feline Friends, she has a new wonderful foster mommy and is doing very well. She still needs a permanent home, so if anyone is interested, let me know. Lots of people have flings in Dubai, but this was an affair to remember!<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000pr97/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000pr97/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Family visit to Dubai meant that I got to be a full-blown tourist! We went on Arabian Adventures (highly recommended) and had high tea at the Burj-al-Arab (not recommended at all - horrible service and tacky as hell). But Arabian Adventures was a blast - dune bashing, shisha, belly dancing, excellent food, open bar, camel rides, and a great desert sunset. Very touristy, but in the best way. All the family had a great time. Plus, we got a 15% discount b/c my cousin works for Emirates. Other family visit highlights include great falafels at Al Mallah, dancing to Bollywood music in my apartment (pics of that will NOT be posted) and hanging out with my cousin and his lovely family. Visit by parents was preceded by almost a week of alone time with the hubby, where we did a whole different set of touristy Dubai things, including massages, lots of tequila shots, fancy dinners, boozy brunch, and the requisite Indian nautch girl joint. Here are some pics from our desert safari:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000r00k/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000r00k/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000qc8b/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000qc8b/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. INDIA! The family packed up for a quick trip to India following Dubai. Only a week but we did so much. In addition to family visits and shopping in Bombay, we took a trip to Khajuraho (site of famous erotic temple sculptures), Delhi, and Agra (site of Taj Mahal). The amount we did in just a few days is mind-boggling. Here are the main attractions...<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000s5y9/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000s5y9/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000tcar/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000tcar/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />Yup, that is a tiger, in the wild! We saw him at Panna national park near Khajuraho. The domesticated elephants find the tigers and surround them. Tigers hate crossing the path of elephants. So we saw the tiger on elephant back!<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000w5de/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000w5de/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000xbkr/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000xbkr/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br />These temples were built around 1100, and there were about 85 of them, all completely covered in intricate sculpture (not just erotic but every imaginable aspect of life). There were Hindu and Jain temples and even some multi-denominational ones. Only a few remain but the effect is still breathtaking. So much so that the following attraction, which requires no introduction, faced strong competition for best spot in India...<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000yb7e/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000yb7e/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />Overall, the trip was too short and I fell in love with Delhi. The historical sites (especially Qutb Minar and Red Fort), the museums (the handicrafts museum was a gem), the shopping, the world-class restaurants (we ate at Bukhara, possibly the most famous restaurant in all of India, where I had the most expensive martini of my life - over 800 rupees, or about $20 USD), the orderly streets (compared to Bombay), and the beautiful Hindi. I will be back! The one thing I hated about the trip, though, was the plethora of Hindu revisionist tour guides we encountered. I sense an article coming on...<br /><br />The following pic is of tea at the Oberoi 600 meters from Taj Mahal. The best service ever and amazing Mughal style architecture, with a bit of French colonial excess (and you can't beat the view!). This puts the Burj-al-Arab tea to shame.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000ze0e/""><img width=""320"" height=""180"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000ze0e/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br /><br /><br />And so, my friends, I am back in Dubai, but for a very short time. My research is drawing to a close, and I am anxious to feel settled somewhere once again (and I miss my baby boys). Thank you to everyone for everything you have done to help me out while I have been here. It has been a wonderful experience that I will look back on fondly. If you still want to talk to me before I leave I will be here for another week. My next post focusing on research stuff will be made from the US (based on time constraints and a bit of paranoia due to recent events). Take care all, and watch this space! I won't be gone too long.

He was not from Dubai so I said I would take her and try to find her a home. This pic doesn't do justice to how tiny she is. She could take a nap on a dvd with room left over! I cleaned her off, got her the essentials (although her litter box is a takeout container since my spinney's had litter but no boxes). I am guessing she is about 5 weeks, but she is potty trained and playful and cleans herself regularly, so she's on her way to being a functioning domestic cat. Anyone want a kitten? Only problem is I am falling in love with her. She's on me every second I am home and has the cutest mew. I need to take her to the vet, but doing that in a taxi is a bit daunting!"

"event","So, I'm sure all of you have read in <a href=""http://www.gulfnews.com/nation/Police_and_The_Courts/10078839.html"">today's news</a> about a subcon man who killed his family and committed suicide in Sharjah. Suicides are on the rise in Dubai, especially among Asians. Meanwhile, there are raging debates (for the first time, some might say) among all kinds of residents about the politics of different nationaitlies, labor exploitation, gender issues, and Islamic culture all over the internet. For examples, take a look at <a href=""http://uaecommunity.blogspot.com/2006/10/miss-emirates.html"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.7days.ae/2006/10/25/sun-sea-and-sexual-harassment.html"">this</a>. Now, I have not been here that long but I see changes, and a paradox among the changes, just in the past year. First, life is getting worse for those who are not European or Arab, Western-educated, with accomodation and moving expenses factored in to their salaries. Rents are rising, salaries are not, Indian and Pakistani economies are gaining strength, and many subcons are going back or dismissing the option of coming here in the first place. Something will have to change soon, because to make the thin profit margins of most of the companies here (esp. those in real estate, construction, import/export), the lower salaries versus high education of subcontinental middle-management is necessary. And, as I have posted before, it is not so simple as these people ""going back"" if they don't like it. Some people have put their life savings, and their family honor, at stake for this opportunity in the UAE, an opportunity they were often lied to about, and one that often finds them in debt for many years with high family expectations back home. Add to that the unhappiness of loss of extended family, long working hours, and stress of loss of certain freedoms here, and the high suicides are not surprising.<br /><br />On the other hand... we have been talking about this so much more, and so much more openly, online and in private social situations. The online community is flourishing, and is less self-censoring than other media here. The level of discussion generated about these issues is promising, and even though people's worst sides often come out, to me this seems a new phenomenon, if just in volume. We are talking about the disjunctions and difficulties of so many different people living in such a unique society, something we have not always done in the past. And, despite the incidents of censorship and blocked sites, and CID visits, things are changing. There is a definite *community* of people online who may never get the chance to interact offline given the stratification in the workplace, culturally, and socially, that there is in the UAE. <br /><br />So, what to make of this paradox? The divide between haves and have-nots is increasing on a daily basis in lived experience here, and yet in many ways divides across nationality, race, class, and gender are decreasing online. What is going to happen here? How are things going to change, or not change? I feel we are at the crux of something, and am looking forward to seeing what that is... (Inshallah)"

"event","Those of you familiar with anthropology know that the crux of our research is fieldwork, that elusive space between objectivity and subjectivity that we occupy when we go into the ""field"" and live among the ""natives"" for an extended period of time, existing simultaneously as insider and outsider, getting the sense of the ""daily texture"" of life in a place, learning the language and customs, and eventually going back to our ivory towers to produce ""thick descriptions"" of said native life.

The traditional fieldwork picture would have looked something like this: White man travels to tropical island/village/hamlet/etc and lives in the finest piece of real estate there (still quite a step down for him), collects a group of native informants to tell him about native life, translate for him, teach him the language, and show him around. Slowly he would foray into the village huts themselves, dining with the natives, enjoying their hospitality, and eventually interviewing them and participating in their rituals, chores, and festivals. In return, for he is to some degree aware of the power and economic differential between himself and his subjects/objects of study, he would bring Western items such as pens and toys and clothing for the people, and even pay them sometimes for their time. This is the traditional field -- a place of isolation and hardship, of the attempted bridging of supposedly different cultural understandings, and of the production of knowledge about the ""other."" Things have changed quite a bit of course with the end of colonialism, the rise of reflexivity in anthropology, and the entry of women and ""native"" anthropologists into the mix, but this idea of the field as a space of difference remains the touchstone of anthropology's unique disciplinarity.

Cut to me, 2006, Dubai. I came of course with the assumption of difference. I have posted before about how Dubai actually is extremely similar to Orange County in many ways, so difference was not as much as expected. I also came with the knowledge that I am a privileged Westerner and therefore obliged to compensate my informants for their time and knowledge. I expected meetings in which the roles were defined, the taker of knowledge and the giver of knowledge defined, the ivory tower far away and the texture of daily life easy to see all around me. WRONG!

I'm still thinking these things through so I don't have a clear analysis of what is going on, but I do have several observations of fieldwork practice that are turning my understanding of the field upside down...

First, when I was here in the beginning I was focused on the gold industry, so would go to the offices of prominent gold merchants and have meetings, observe the goings on, etc. I felt like I was intruding upon their time, but I was treated as a guest. I would be given water, tea, dates, even sandwiches upon arrival, apologized to for having to wait even 2 minutes, and often sent home with somebody's car and driver. My arrival in the gold souk seemed to be a respite for people from their regular routine and the presence of a female was so unusual that I got even more special treatment. Oh well, I figured. This is because I am ""studying up."" These are wealthy individuals who have more privilege and power than I do, and because I am a woman, there is an added element of having to look after me. When I interact with middle-class Indians, things will be different.

So I come back to the field, ready to interview said middle-class Indians. First thing to hit me is my recruitment practices. I put up ads on the internet boards that I frequent. No ""traditional"" sampling methods for me. Not having much to offer in terms of compensation for time (Dubai is bleeding my dollars away!), I offered a free coffee. So many people responded saying they would love to meet, have coffee etc. So the meetings happened in coffee shops in malls around town. They are still going on, so those of you reading this that want to be interviewed let me know! Anyway, my first job was to buy the coffee before we began the interview. Very few people let me buy them coffee! In fact, almost all insisted on buying ME coffee, saying that I was their guest in Dubai. During the interviews, I was asked many questions about my project, about living as an Indian in the US, etc. And then after the interviews, I inevitably received a text or email thanking me for letting me share their stories! This is a very different field indeed, and plays with my notions of privilege and give and take. Many Indians are sharing their stories for the first time and happy to have an ear, and many are using me to learn from instead of me just learning from them. Also, while most Indians here are remitting home in rupees and significantly less well-off than my American dollars self, many are in positions of greater wealth and privilege than I will ever know. And this field is more expensive than my home in many ways, and contains many different forms of ivory towers (and minarets). And I float in and out of ""difference,"" ""culture shock,"" and comfort, familiarity, and feeling more at home here than at home. 

In a classic case of being different and the same, I have just written a very navel-gazing (classic anthropologist style) post about how the classic anthropological field is non-existent. Oh well, more I am sure later..."

"event","So here I am, back in Dubai to continue this crazy fieldwork thing. What a roller coaster of emotional ups and downs it is to live for months in one place and then in another and now back again. I had this epiphany before I came here back in January that I am the child of immigrants and yet completely unaccustomed to living abroad or travelling extensively. I commend all you expats out there, because if this tiny sliver of experience I am having for the first time in my life is any indication, it is a damn hard thing to do, and I can't even imagine doing it when it is not voluntary, nor when you are not a privileged Westerner with all the perks that come along with that, especially in a place like Dubai.

Anyway, the jetlag means I am up at 5 am or earlier every day and in this limbo state between when the day gets started here and when my friends and family back in the states are just getting back from their work day. I truly feel like I am living in two temporalities at once.

So some first impressions being back in Dubai after an absence of only 3 months:

- Ramadan is quiet and lovely and the whole city feels different. It also feels more like a community since we are at least sharing a change in routine to some extent no matter what we do. This is my first experience of Ramadan in a Muslim country and I know it is not like most Muslim places, but very interesting and I am glad to be going through it (though I have to say I do miss the clubbing!)

-construction! my goodness the Burj Dubai project has progressed so significantly. The construction site right behind my apartment building is also totally different and there are a LOT of changes in my neighborhood. There is a brand new hotel on Mankhool street and a whole bunch of new hotel apartments in the Golden Sands area. 

-weather: it is much cooler in the evenings and I have been enjoying walking around much more. Dubai is a walkable city in Bur Dubai, Karama, and Deira areas and this is so easily forgotten. Being able to walk is a joy and I am also saving a lot of money, I think I have been in one cab total since I got here a week ago.

-Blending in and not blending in: it is amazing how different aspects of one's identity become salient or insignificant based on context. I grew up feeling so conscious of being brown in a white world, and here I forget that I am. Yet I am SO much more conscious of being female here. I have to think about what i am wearing depending on where I choose to go (not that it stops the stares no matter what I wear - SO much more frustrating after a summer of being ignored!). I have plans to do a bunch of research in government and real estate offices. I have so far been almost exclusively doing work among Indians, so I am interested to see how my perceptions of myself will change being around more Emiratis.

-transience: this place is so different than any other I know or have heard of. Half of my friends from a few months ago are gone, but I have already made some new ones just in a week. Things just seem more intense here. People make and lose friends faster. I imagine the dating scene must be similar as well.

OK, this is not the usual well-thought-out intellectual post I aim for on this blog, but I needed to spit out some thoughts, get back in the game, and establish the fact (to myself most of all) that I am back in Dubai and need to get some work done!"

"event","So, today marks the five-year anniversary of the World Trade center attacks in NYC. I woke up this morning, as most Americans, I am guessing, to news coverage of solemn remembrance ceremonies, narratives of friends and families of people lost on 9/11, and footage of the planes flying into the buildings. <br />Surprisingly, or not so surprisingly, Cheney was on the news yesterday admitting that there is no proven connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11, nor are there any weapons of mass destruction, nor is there any connection between Saddam and Al-Qaida. Yet we are doing a ""pretty good job"" in Iraq!<br />Therefore, the ""war on terror"" is still justified, as is our presence in Iraq, according to the government, pundits, and a lot of Americans. Along with the justification for increased fear-mongering about the lack of security at our airports, borders, ports, etc. And meanwhile, nothing has happened on American soil in the 5 years that we have supposedly been at war. Nothing, that is, except for Arab and South-Asian looking men being detained for no reason, civil liberties being eroded, people being pulled off of planes for speaking Arabic, and a slew of other ""suspicious"" activity.<br />So, every reason for being in Iraq is refuted, there is no terrorism to speak of against America, and here we are, hundreds of thousands of civilians later, with two toppled governments overseas, and the possibility of expansion into other Middle Eastern countries based on a supposed war that is being fought. <br />Why? The sentimental pull of 9/11, its fortification of a particular kind of American identity (non-brown), and the branding of Arabs, Islam, and Arabic as perpetually suspect allow for American military action overseas to be justified, no matter what the facts of the matter are. This is blatant racism, yet it is hardly ever called such, except for in isolated incidents. So, pulling someone off a plane might be racist, but since there is a ""real"" threat from Islamicists, screening Muslim men is a legitimate consideration. But tell me what is the ""real"" in the threat, please, because I have yet to see it, and things have gotten so blurry that it seems as long as there is a Middle East, and as long as there is Islam, Americans will think there is a threat. What is this besides racism? If you paint with a broad enough brush, everyone is a potential terrorist, and we are in a renewed stage of American expansionism, or if we are calling things by their true names, <strong>imperialism</strong>."

"event","What is the role of language in questions of security, identity, and civil rights?<br /><br />Today's <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5297822.stm"">BBC World news reports</a> that a passenger was harassed and forced to change clothes on a Jet Blue flight from NYC to LA for wearing a T shirt with an Arabic slogan on it (actually an anti-war slogan). Passengers have also been reported to be restrained for speaking Arabic on planes and there was an incident with a <a href=""http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/08/23/10062053.html"">UAE couple speaking Arabic on the London Eye</a> as well.<br /><br />In the UAE, there's an opposite issue going on right now with expat residents claiming that <a href=""http://www.7days.ae/2006/08/25/no-english-999-ever-tried-learning-arabic.html"">emergency services should not just be limited to Arabic</a> as it is a multi-national society despite the strong restrictions on naturalization. The notion that expats should at least try to learn some Arabic is often expressed by nationals and was so in my interviews as well. On the other hand, many expats said they never had a chance or reason to learn since all business is conducted in English or Hindi, languages that nationals themselves often use.<br /><br />In the case of the US, there have been debates raging for decades, especially here in California, about bilingual education and its impact on national identity and culture. Many right-wingers feel that Spanish in particular is a threat, and advocate denial of services and education to non-English speakers. The result is that American kids are losing native languages and also missing out on the chance of learning new languages. On the flip side, the government sees the problem with lack of language skills when it comes to its foreign policy interests. FLAS programs in Arabic and Farsi are growing, and Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Central Asian language programs are at capacity in our universities.<br /><br />There seems to be a fine balance therefore between maintaining linguistic hegemony for the sake of some perceived ""pure"" identity that is at threat of hybridization, and the practicalities of multi-lingual knowledge for global interchange, political power struggles, and international business. Language is of course a huge factor of belonging, with immigrants working very hard to make sure children maintain cultural identities by teaching them language and other ""cultural"" skills, and nation-states attempting to police the borders of national identity through markers such as language, dress, riutals, etc. But language is also just as often presented as a neutral, innocuous thing -- everybody does it a bit differently, but we all have it so we are all just the same underneath, etc, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, just thought I would put this out there and ask others for their thoughts on the role of language in the types of issues we have been discussing on the UAE boards, in academic circles, and at the dinner table. Please share your two dirhams (up from two fils due to rapid rise of cost of living)!"

This is the first week, so we started with the usual basic texts dealing with questions of representation of the ""other"" in anthro, including Said's Orientalism. The students had a little trouble with it, but seemed to get a good grasp by the end of lecture. I also found this great video of an interview with Edward Said on his concept of Orientalism (aptly titled ""Edward Said on Orientalism"") and showed it to the students today. I expected them to be bored and doing other things but halfway through the video I turned around and they were all watching with a lot of interest. The video was excellent, touching on the way that US media demonizes Islam and produces the Middle East as a homogenous, threatening place full of terrorists. The thing is, the film was made in 1997! How completely (and sadly) timely that I showed it today in class considering all that is going on. It seemed like it was made yesterday, not pre- 9/11. I just wanted to take this moment and acknowledge how amazing Said was (controversy and all) and how great his work is as a teaching tool. My students are going to look at the news differently today (at least those of them that read the news!) and that means a lot to me. Also, for teaching undergrads (and family members!), I want to recommend Said's <u>Covering Islam</u>, and excellent and accessible book on media representations of the Middle East."

But, an Indian professor here in Socal had pointed out to me before I left for fieldwork that there is this trend of Dubai Indians relocating to Irvine. I found that very strange, until I did a little comparison of the two places. Here's some food for thought (or reason to cry for me):

1. In the 60's Dubai was nothing but sand; in the 60's Orange County was nothing but orange groves
2. On the UC Irvine campus, buildings built in the 70's are considered historic; on Sheikh Zayed Road, the World Trade Center (which hails from the 80's I think) is considered historic
3. In Irvine, one company owns all of the housing, and sets rents accordingly;&nbsp; In Dubai, basically Emaar, Dubai Holdings, and Nakheel (all involved with the govt to some degree) own most of the housing, and set rents accordingly
4. In Orange County, the two major forms of entertainment on the weekend are shopping malls and beaches; same for Dubai
5. In Orange County, there is a largely ignored but completely necessary underclass of Mexican migrants who take care of our lawns, cook our food, clean our homes, and build new shopping malls; for Dubai, substitute Indian/Sri Lankan/Filipina
6. Orange county uniform = oversized designer handbag, oversized designer shades, $200 jeans, and tank top; Dubai uniform = oversized designer handbag, oversized designer shades, $200 jeans, tank top, and abaya
7. In the OC, no one is a real blonde; in Dubai, also doubt it
8. In the OC, Asians are taking over; same with Dubai!

"event","This is a preliminary post on this topic, and I have stats somewhere on this but still need to dig them up. This post is inspired by <a href=""http://grapeshisha.blogspot.com/"">Grapeshisha</a>, who sent me this <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/story/39273/"">article</a> on poverty in the US. While I have been in the field, the debate over ""illegal"" immigration has gotten pretty hot in the US, esp. in CA where I live. I am often told by informants (the ones that do the hiring, not the workers) that things are so much better for workers in Dubai vs. the US because everyone is here legally, and they are gaining rights, and basically the attitude of ""if they don't like it they can just go home."" This tactic of comparing Dubai to US to show that there are rights and democratic formations in the UAE is interesting and not wrong in and of itself (it is in fact what I am trying to do with my whole argument that alternate forms of citizenship do exist here). But, the way it is done - to justify the treatment of workers in Dubai, the stratified pay scales, the holding of passports, etc - is missing a lot of information.<br /><br />This discourse of ""choice"" used by both locals and wealthier expats to talk about laborers here is flawed. Why? Because for most laborers, working in the Gulf is an investment, one that leaves them in debt and unable to go back. There are many hidden costs in migrating. First, there are many agencies set up in places like India that take money from people (often thousands of American dollars, which represent life savings plus loans for most) to help them secure jobs, get visas, etc. Second, many people have to finance their own trips to the Gulf, overstaying visit visas while looking for employment. Third, the money promised is often not provided when the worker arrives, thus prolonging the debt period. Some workers work off their debt so they actually don't see a salary for many years. Fourth, there is family back home relying on remittances which makes it a huge psychological pressure to stay, on top of the economic one. Fifth, they have your passport! They might not give it back, and if your work situation sucks and you leave, you could be banned, thus restricting your future earning prospects.<br /><br />Of course most of you who have been blogging on Gulf life already probably know all this. But, my interest here is the way that the Gulf is exceptionalized in the literature and media about migration. I am interested in talking about some of the similarities between seemingly different systems (like for example the US situation and Dubai). In the US our migration is structured around citizenship. You migrate legally and you are on some path to citizenship. You migrate ""illegally"" and you are a perpetual outsider. In the Gulf there is basically no path to citizenship. Legal and illegal migration both leave you as a perpetual outsider <em>under the law. </em>But what other institutions besides the law regulate your experiences of migration? What is the role of global economics, social networks, geography, culture, religion, etc. Here I think we can look at similarities between seemingly disparate systems. Don't you think?"

http://www.gulfnews.com/business/Commerce/10054341.html

In my research, I have been talking to a lot of Indian business people, particularly in the gold industry. According to many of them, and especially the Indians who work in gold on the Indian side (Bombay, Gujarat, etc.) Dubai basically is successful because of the restrictive laws of the countries surrounding it, esp. India and Iran. So they see Dubai as an extension of India in many ways, particularly as it allows them to make greater profit by having part or all of their business in a tax haven that is still so close to India. But these people also seem to think of themselves as different from Indians in India, especially the way they live (with more interaction with other groups, particularly the fact that they interact with Pakistanis here) and the ways their kids are (more cosmopolitan).

A major theoretical argument I want to make in my dissertation is that while people in the Gulf seem to think that Indians are here solely for economic reasons, their identities are changed at the core by being here, and that they do think of themselves as belonging, esp. to Dubai, in ways that are not just economic. This is reflected I think in people's daily practices as well.

Any thoughts? Do Indians belong to Dubai? In what ways? If you are an Indian here, do you feel you belong? Is belonging different based on class? These business people are obviously wealthy and can have their families here, which is a major factor involved in feeling settled in a place.

"event","I went to Jordan for a conference in early June and it was a great experience for a number of reasons. First, it was the only Middle eastern country I had been to besides the Emirates, and I was shocked at the difference - first of all, you need Arabic to get by! Who would have thunk it? In Dubai Hindi gets you so much further than Arabic. There are many academics in Gulf Studies who are questioning the concept of the ""Middle East"" as an area and thinking about what it would mean to look at the Gulf as part of the ""Indian Ocean."" I think this is especially interesting in terms of Dubai, but it does point to differences in one's own position. I think Indians (both from India and elsewhere) experience Dubai as more 'Indian' than others might, but it is still interesting to consider to what degree (economically, socially, culturally) Dubai might be an extension of the subcontinent...<br /><br />Other great things about Jordan: I gave my first paper to a room full of area studies people (it was on Indian businessmen and free zones) and got a very positive response, I bonded again with a colleague who is doing her research in Kuwait, and I got to visit a lot of wonderful sites, especially Petra. Being in the Levant region really made me want to improve my Arabic and also travel a lot more there, but alas, the situation now makes it an impossibility for when I return to Dubai.<br /><br />In honor of <span class=""ljuser""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" src=""http://www.livejournal.com/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" alt="""" />dubaiwalla</span>, here are some pics from my trip<br /><br />Amman:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/000016gf/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/000016gf/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/000027gy/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/000027gy/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00003qe2/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00003qe2/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00004yqt/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00004yqt/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br />the original 'Philadelphia':<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00005f3z/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00005f3z/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/000066w3/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/000066w3/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />and the gem of the whole trip, PETRA:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000758r/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/0000758r/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00008rzy/""><img width=""180"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00008rzy/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00009911/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nativeinformant/pic/00009911/s320x240"" /></a>"

"event","My first blog entry ever - didn't realize I would be so nervous. So I am dipping my feet in with trepidation. This blog is meant to be an account of my thoughts about Dubai and my experiences as an anthropologist doing fieldwork there. I am a graduate student in Anthro in Southern CA and I just came back from 6 months in Dubai and will be back again in a couple months to do some more research.

The basic premise of my research is 1. how do people belong to a place when they have no access to citizenship? and 2. how do citizens understand their belonging in the UAE when they are a small minority of the population? Until now I have been doing interviews with Indian expats in Dubai, asking these sorts of questions, getting life experiences in Dubai and their thoughts on living here. I will be branching out when I come back and try to talk to nationals as well. So the purpose of this blog is both to share my experiences and to get people's feedback (and hopefully even some people who are willing to be interviewed about life in Dubai).

Some thoughts on what I am doing now in SoCal while I am missing my friends and life in Dubai:

1. just started reading Dubai by Robin Moore, a book about gold smuggling in the emirate set in the 70's. It is a novel but many of the old-time gold guys I know in Dubai told me to treat it as history... we shall see. So far, the writer seems knowledgable about the mideast in the 70's but the writing is atrocious, so I am having a hard time getting into it.

2. Just saw Deewar again last night - an Amitabh Bachan ""angry young man"" Bollywood film from the 70's. Interestingly enough, one of the premises was that the mob boss in Dubai was into smuggling gold from Dubai. The connections between Dubai and India fascinate me, esp. how Indians often use Dubai as an ""offshore"" site of sorts to get around regulations of the Indian govt.

3. Blogging about Dubai is of great interest to me b/c it seems like even though there technically isn't much freedom of speech in the Emirates, people maintain some active and often very critical blogs. Now that I am a part of it too, I would love to hear more about what can and can't be said here, and people's experiences with that.

Anyway, I hope this works ok for an introductory post. Looking forward to any and all feedback (and feel free to email me privately if you want to set up an interview -- I would appreciate it greatly!)"

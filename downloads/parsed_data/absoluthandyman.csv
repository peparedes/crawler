"event","so... my journal embaresses me.  i was a wierd kid. im still a wierd kid, and i still can't spell.  Um... shit, i don't know if i'll have enough time to start keeping a journal again, but i thought i should at least note that i've changed allot since ive started this thing.  Im not as happy as i used to be, but i think im moving in a good direction in life.  Im learning chinese, i'll be graduating in a year, and ive been turned on to much better music, cinema, and literature than i ever would have expected.  Unfortunatly, current events have keep me so anxious and frustrated that i have lost all ability to concentrate on things such as living, being happy, or keeping up in school.  I cry every day now, it sucks.  For the first time in my life i feel a genuine hate, it sucks.  Im ashamed in myself.  I sleep less, eat less, and get less work done, but somehow i am overwhelmed with shit.  I don't have a job and spend most of my time at school looking in trash cans for left over food. Yesterday i found a whole slice of vegetarian pizza.  It was great, but got me wondering ""what kind of vegatarian would throw away a whole slice of pizza?"".  Ive starting reconizing the fact that i might have a future in music.  I have been too busy to pursue my music interests, but ive discovered the wonder and magic of circuit bending and have been expeirmenting with glitch and noise music.  I am pooooooor. Giving plasma for a living sucks, especially when you hardley eat enough food to provide healthy plasma.  And im angry?!?!? ive never been angry before!!!! since when have i been a grumpy mother fucker? people like me piss me off.  When have people ever pissed me off?!?!? shit.  i can't live in a world like this, i can't function in a country that commits such atrocities.  shit... i can't write about stuff like this.   im a fool, i need to concentrate on things like butterflies and robot.  I like robots.  i like flowers and insects.  i enjoy the wilderness.  don't go to www.fromthewilderness.com, it will make you very angry with people.  No, go there, its a great website, i just get too overwhelmed to function properly.  Today i fell over in front of my class room, i feel like i can't breathe sometimes.  whats wrong with me.  Fuck, now im sounding really ridiculous.  Don't think im into emo or anything.  Listen to my radio show on wed 1-2 and thursdays 3-4 on www.wcks.org.  IM me at absoluthandyman or wvks to request songs.  Im kind of new to new wave, glitch, electro-clash, and noise, so let me know if you have any good suggestions.  alright... im going to leave before i make a fool of myself.   I need to dance more.  Dance right in the middle of a busy intersaction.  I need to live more, eat more, breathe more.  why do i have such an affinity for vagarancy, why do i feel like my calling is on the train tracks, why do i wish i could get deported?  i shouldn't been having these feelings.  I shouldn't be thinking about asking for political asylumn when i need to be practicing my chinese characters.  I should be watching tati movies, not reading about PAX Amerikana and assasinations. Fuck... what to do what to do.... why are you reading this?

"event","so... i guess its about time I update this journal.  To tell you the truth, I kind of forgot I had it.  In the last 5 months I have moved into a beautiful apartment downtown in the historical neighborhood and gotten my life rolling again.  Well... I guess life will not truelly be rolling till I get outta school.  I really want to leave right now and move to China or Vietnam, but I almost have my BA.  Well, if I change my major, I'll be pretty much back to square one.  Lately Ive been thinking film school here is a waste and I dont even know why I bother.  Id much rather be rooming the world or listening to the snow melt.  I dont see why I should worry about bullshit like careers when i would be perfectly happy tending to a water buffelo in the huanan proveince of China.  Wow, my spelling is atrocious today.  Anyhow, sometimes I just think jobs that make good money are only for people that are hard to please and think they need all this useless shit in their lives to stay happy.  Well, look whos talking.  I just spent 80 bucks on a theremin kit just to fool around with.  But really, i don't spend money anymore, that was a rare exception.  Oh yeah, Im spending the summer in Shanghai!!  Im real excited.  If anyone else out their in livejournal land is in China this summer, let me know and we could show eachother around.  I'll be bringing some camera equipment to make a teaser with to atract more people to the study abroad program at East China Normal University.  Oh shit... its getting late.  Im going to hit the sack.  maybe I'll start writing more oftern now... ok.... bu-bye"

"event","hey... i just figuered out that if i was to find a planet that was about 3.6 light years away, and fly their and back in a spaceship traveling 99% the speed of light, my brother would be the same age as me when i got back.  It would only take me a few months. That would be pretty cool.  My brothers only twelve right now, but i can't wait till he's my age... we could hang out.  Of course, all my other buddies would be in their late twenties and early thirties, but it would be worth it.  yeah know what though... then i'd miss out on 7 years of my brothers life... that wouldn't be very cool.  Plus, 12 is a fun age, my brother is awsome as he is.  I guess i'd just as rather hang out with a 12 year old jo-jo than a 19-20 year old jo-jo.  WHAT IF HE DIDNT USE THE WORD ""BOOMER"" ANYMORE, OR DIDN""T HAVE ANY TIME TO HANG OUT WITH SCHOOL AND WORK!!! yeah know what, maybe time dialation isn't the smartest thing at the moment.  I guess i'll have to think of another use for the ""twin paradox"" some other time...

I'll be fine until my paychecks come, but its still not that fun. also, i was supposed to be doing this backyard wrestling thing with my old buddies back home yesterday and today, but i don't have a way to get to detroit from here, and no money for gas so i can't just borrow a friends car.  It sucks, cause even though i don't like wrestling that much, its allot of fun.  They bought me a costume for it too.  One time i was a french maid and ended up getting on national television for it. hee hee hee... then my mom threw it out cause she didn't wanna see me in it on the news any more. hee hee hee.  its allot of fun, last time we had proffesional ring girls, a huge wall screen, sequrity, cops, news reporters, and the whole nineyards.  anyways, it would have been fun to see the old gang again.  oh well.  i guess thats about it for now..."

Anyways, im going to this cool gals prom with her.  Its all the way across the state though so i have to rile up some gas cash.  Also... Kertis's B-day was allot of fun.  We went to go see Shrek...... great movie.  I liked it so much that i took home the 10 foot shrek standup thingie from the movie theatre. I don't think sequrity liked that too much.  it was a miracle that we could fit it into the jeep.  Its a good thing her windows were tinted cause the parking lot was swarmed with mall sequrity shortly after. hee hee.... oops.  anyways, my moms visiting my new apartment for the first time today, so i have to get back to cleaning up.  bu-bye

"event","oh boy... i am now one day older, and my birthday is over.  i had a very splendid birthday.  actually, two hours ago i may have sai it was awful, but a swell gal helped change that for me.  i have slept about 6 hours in the past 3-4 days, and drank each of those nights.   also, im broke... and outta darts.  so, things are looking fairly misreble in the morning.  i worked all day. came home and drank. and played with my cat.  some really sell gals from down the way had me and some pals over for a big pot luck dinner. that was a huge success.  i made vegan chilli and cous cous.  it all turned out GREAT! also, one of the gals made me a cake, well, me and the other birthday boy.  all in all, it was a very plesant little suprise dinner but after about 45 minutes, everyone had left.  so at abut 6 o'clock, things suck again.  i sat around and listened to music, chatted, and pet my kitten.  at around 9 the sweetest gal, and host of the dinner earlier, stopped by and keep me company for about 15 minutes, and that really cheared me up.  I drank allot after she left and bleached polka dots into my hair... that was a blast.  by this time, absolutly knowbody is around.  everyone is sleeping or clubbin.  so i started makeing a new mix tape for the work truck and i read 1984 while i waited for each song to end.  eventually a decided to pay a visit to that swell gal i mentioned earlier and bring her an apple at work.  boy oh boy did we have a nice time. i whooped her butt in scrabble, and we talked and watched the discovery channel.  honostly, thats about as pleasant as my evening could have possibly gotten.  she had made me an absolutly georgous birthday card... and that really made my day :)  i really like this gal, i actually just meet her, but i know we'll be cooking and talking alot together.  shes one of those girls that insprires you. that gives you more questions than answers.  encourages your own personel development, and we are both extremly interested in healthy living.  unfortunatly, she has somesort of boyfriend somewhere, but thats ok. shes a wonderful gal and im just as excited about being her friend as i would be about dating her.anyhow, ive got lots more to say, but i can't keep my eyes open.  im worn out, but its ok cause i can finally sleep in tomarrow.  ok... bu-bye

"event","Dear diary...
     today i helped an old handicapped women change apartments.  I got to carry her bedpan and everything!! unfortunatly, she wasn't being very nice, so i put all of her food on the top shelfs of the refrigerator were she couldn't reach it.   hee hee hee.  I learned that even if your crippled, you still have to be nice to people or you might starve.  time for my afternoon nap....

ciao"

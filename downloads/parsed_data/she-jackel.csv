"event","I'm not as regular on this site as I'd like to be ..but its at least still here waiting for me each time I log in :)

I'm hanging in there ..still working contract for Manpower.  I'm on a new contract this last month working for the City of Las Cruces in their cashier office for the utility department.  I've been sitting all day at the same desk opening mail.  They got back logged over the holiday with two new billing systems going online (without a try first) so it got totally screwed up and that's why folks are getting more than one bill a month right now :P

Its a job but only making $10 per hour (I whine but I'm lucky to be making that much) so will hang on and see if they will hire a few of us when they move into the new City offices in March.  They need a few folks to help them keep up with just the mail.  

On the other side ..staying busy with events and life here.  A few of us attended a Imbolc ceremony this last weekend down on the Rio Grande River.  It was lovely.  We (House folks) were asked to do a blessing for the West (Ancestors) so we did a prayer to them first and then another prayer to Hapi just at the same time we dropped in the Nile water (yep real Nile water that was brought back by the pilgrimages to Egypt) and then scooped it up again to pour over the seeds (new beginnings) that were in the earth and ash that had been blessed beforehand.  It was a very nice ceremony.

This coming weekend is ROADTRIP!  Heading to Long Beach from Las Cruces - why the hell would I do that you ask?  Simple - family ..flying down from Alaska.  I'm stopping in Phoenix on the way over and picking up my daughter and grandsons and we are heading over on Friday.  My mom and sister are taking a short cruise to Mexico out of Long Beach.  We will stay on the Queen Mary while they are here and I head home Sunday.  The oldest grandson watches Ghost Hunters and he saw the episode on the Queen Mary and told me he was scared to stay on the boat and I told him that Grandma would do her magic and Yinepu would make sure that there were no ghosts around us and everything would be ok and we would have fun and take lots of pictures :)

Will be really long ...long ..long trip.  Its like 16 hour drive nonstop from here to Long Beach, CA.  I am leaving after work Thursday night and that will take me to Phoenix (5.5 hours one way).  I will sleep in on Friday and then get up when my daughter gets home from work and we'll take off for Long Beach.  That portion of the trip is another 7 hours or so with good traffic.  I know the route like the back of my hand ..living there for the 4.5 years has its advantages :)

Next weekend is Pcon in San Jose, California.  I really had considered going this year but I will be in surgery on the 12th so that's out.  The left knee has been giving me grief since late October 09.  I tore the meniscus when I was moving stuff and then re-injured it again and to say the least its not a happy camper and the pain is driving me up the wall and the meds are not what I want to be taking every single day :P  So better get it looked at and be done with it.  Its going to cost me a pretty penny after insurance pays their 70%.  I'm estimating the bill to be between $2,000 and $3,000 when its all said and done.  I'm trying to make arrangements to cover the whole cost as the doctor's office WILL NOT take payments later than a few days ahead so you have to cough it all up front :P

Keep me in your prayers that it goes well and I heal quickly and can get back on track with being healthy and walking and doing the stuff I was doing before this happened.

For the House folks ..all of us are in my prayers and I'm praying that we will be stronger for this and we can avert anymore problems along these lines.  Netjer willing ..we will be just fine :)

"event","OMG - they have been playing Christmas music here in Las Cruces for the last week!  It not even flipping Thanksgiving yet?  WTF?  I think its the retail stores that are panicing about the economy and they are trying everything in their power to get stuff sold before the end of the year so they don't lose their stores or have to file bankruptcy.

As far as me ...sure bring on the holidays. I really don't celebrate Christmas (more than giving presents to the kids and grandbabies).  I like to hang with friends and family but nothing too intense and certainly not in crowded areas!  I will be happy when its all over and January 2010 is here.

So nothing else new ..still working the contract job for the civil engineer in Mesilla Park.  I've got my application in with the State, City and County here but I was horrified to see the LOW wages they pay for state employees ..holy shit how does anyone make it on that wage?  I'm only getting $11.25 an hour now (and I was making $27 an hour before I left southern CA) and I'm barely making it (well I'm not if you count the few bills that are going to collections ~ sigh and nothing I can do about it for now).  I guess if you had a roommate or significant other that would help but I have neither :-(

I do have a lot to be grateful and thankful for though!  Good friends, family and loved ones.  Folks that stepped up to help me when I moved here to Las Cruces.  You know who you are!  I couldn't have made the move without each and every one of you!  By Temple family rocks and I'm so damn lucky to have them :)

Ok ..gotta get back to work but wanted to at least put something up in case you were wondering if I had dropped off the face of the earth :P

P.S. - I do have another journal going on Facebook under my english name and you are welcome to friend me on it but please note I do not discuss KO on that site as its set up for my personal and professional stuff.  I'm using this LJ account for my temple posts and friends.

Have a great Thanksgiving and take care of yourselves.  Talk to you all again soon!

Here are a few pictures of our Opet Festival we did today out in the Desert.  It was a great success.  The only thing we could not do was to take a picture of Amun (he wanted to stay 'hidden).  We had a great time ..glad I brought a cooler full of water as we went through them all!  The other two (Mut and Khonsu) were ok with them being out in the open but Mr. Amun (well you know) he had to stay 'mysterious.'

Brought a ton of offerings as you can see and fresh flowers to toss into the path as we proceeded down the road.  We had someone doing oil and throwing flowers as we went ..it was so cool!

The place we used had two roads and a crossroad with a north and south axis as well ..so we set up shrines on the axis road and carried the statues down and said all the appropriate things as we went. We even had a picture of Hemet on the alters so we could address Her as well. We made an extra offering to the local food bank for the poor like they would have done in ancient times (they fed the poor at the festivals).

This was a trial run for next year - we will be inviting anyone that wants to come out and attend.  The weather was in the mid 90's today.  If you were wondering where I am ..I'm taking the pictures.  Weshebut's mom took some of me so when I get those I will put them up.  Thank you to the Las Cruces group - way to go guys and we rock!!

"event","Hello everyone!

Just a quick note to let you know I'm settling in nicely over here in Las Cruces.  Found a beautiful historic house in old town Mesilla (you NEVER see rentals there) the story goes its haunted! (for folks who know me its perfect).  I was in there last night talking to the landlord's sister whose family has lived there for generations.  They confirmed for me the house is most definately haunted (by their grandparents and relatives).  While we were there Grandpa and Grandma showed up and hung in the kitchen while we chatted (for about an hour).  I could see them standing there ..and they were trying to talk to one of the young girls who was there with her mother (the sister of the landlord) but she couldn't see them.  They were all so excited when I told them I could see and hear the dead and I think they will be spending a lot of time at my place talking to me (the younger ones will for sure). If all goes well I'll be moving in there by October 10.           

I've been to one agency and job interview ..and got the job immediately!  Wow...that has not happened for years!  I was not able to find anything decent in Phoenix and I come here and the jobs are laying around for the taking..but of course the pay is lower and I've not worked this low for years but its money so I'm not complaining. I'm working a contract for an environmental engineer and he's really laid back and my hours are flexible and he will let me have time off for filming (he's given me permission to take as much as I want) and they really like me so I think if I play it right I will have a job for awhile :)


Other news: I am waiting to hear back from the local Hospice organization regarding my volunteer application as I'm still wanting to do this and open up my own business doing funeral services when I can get enough contacts and get my business license.  

I've also been accepted as a volunteer for the Chihuahua Desert Wildlife Refuge and will be meeting folks this coming week.  I will be helping feed, rehabilitate and take care of the raptors, birds (songbirds, water fowl), amphibians and reptiles...I'll do whatever they need me to do!

As if that wasn't exciting enough ..I got a call back regarding the casting agency here in Las Cruces!  I'm on the casting call for October (start filming 10/9) when they start filming the new movie ""DUE DATE"" which will star Robert Downey Jr. (one of my favorite actors) in a comedy.  Its being filmed locally as the movie folks have been doing a lot of work these last few years in New Mexico and especially out by White Sands (Transformers 1 and 2 were filmed there).  My role will be an extra sitting in my car during a scene where he drives by like 100 cars trying to get home before his wife gives birth to their child.  I'm really excited about this as its going to be so much fun. 

No rest for the wicked so I'm looking for more work please (as I have committed to helping the kids stay in the house in Phoenix since I moved out - I don't want them to have problems down the line with a lease breakage so I will do what I can to keep them close to me) and will be very busy.

I will post pics of the new place as soon as I know for sure I'm in.  Its so beautiful .. a little 2 bdrm house with so much history and ghosts!  Its a block off the main plaza and the old church (basillica) is absolutely gorgeous!  There is a spirit inside the church (Senut and I met him the first time we went in to the church to pray) who wanted to know who we were and we told him ..and after that he was very nice but we didn't know for sure until after we found out that there was a priest who is actually buried on the grounds.  The church is Catholic and the local population here a mix of Native American and Hispanic.  The end of October will be the huge Day of the Dead celebration.  I never ever imagined I'd be able to walk to it from my own house right in the middle of the party!

This historic place is also where a lot of the Old Wild West happened.  The courthouse where Billy the Kid was tried and found guilty has been turned into a tourist store but the vibes are still there and the whole city has been restored so it looks like you stepped back into the 1800's. Its not far from the Rio Grande and the Tortuga tribe is one of the local indingenous tribes that has owned land in Mesilla for generations.  The man I'm renting from is also with this tribe and his family has owned the house for generations (and I look forward to meeting the other relatives who are hanging around the house as I was told a good number of them passed away in the House).  He was just out at White Sands last weekend (doing an ancestor ritual) when we met.  The house has been empty for months and he's been waiting for the 'right' person to rent it to ..I think he's found one (ME).

Other than that ..Las Cruces is awesome!  I'm here with Neb, Weshebut, Azebet, Kai Imakhu Senut and a huge group of other folks in the pagan tradition so its got a good variety of folks and things to do here.  We are celebrating Opet Festival this Sunday by going out into one of the state parks and taking our icons and doing it outside!  This way Amun can definately 'survey' his kingdom.

Once I'm settled in I will be opening up my State shrine for House members to come and visit as Yinepu really ...really wants to meet you all!

Dua Netjer (thank God) for all the blessings you have given me this last two weeks.  I will do my best to play it forward."

Just a short note to let my LJ friends know I will be out of town - heading to retreat in Chicago.  Will be gone Aug 1 to Aug 9 back in town on the 10th.

Its that time again the annual House of Netjer New Year retreat ..time to see old friends and new friends ...can't wait to see everyone again.

So for now ...I'll be absent but will post when I get back from there.  I will be taking lots of pictures so look for those when I get back.

Hopefully our gods ..will make sure that the next year is a good one :)

"event","Well ...yes its been like almost a year since I posted (well last October sometime I think) and I'm alive and kicking still :P

I've set up another site over on Facebook that has my personal life and family pictures and outings posted there while I'm keeping my LJ account for my Egyptian and pagan friends to keep in touch with me.

I moved from southern CA in March over to Phoenix, AZ and I'm living with my daughter and grandsons in a nice little 4 bdrm 2 bath house over by South Mountain park.  

The weather is to die for (literally) but we've made use of the innertubes and have been tubing down the Salt River a few times now and had a blast doing it ..as well as having a large number of my prior Alaska family that has relocated here now too (they have pools!) so we manage to keep from heatstroking.

I'm looking for a FT job but its very slow here and nothing so far.  I've done 2 contract jobs that were short and nothing lined up yet for this next month.

I'll be going to Chicago for the annual HoN retreat over in Joliet so I'll be offline while I'm gone but will check back in when I return and maybe post some pics of this year's celebration (I still don't know the names of the Gods to whom this new year belongs).

What do you think of my new photo?  I've been under a lot of stress and had to make some major changes in diet and habits I've had the last few years ..so I'm finally getting healthy and lost weight which has helped some of the pain in my back and knees.

I found out I have a torn rotator cuff on my left shoulder but with no insurance and no money ..there isn't any way I can have surgery until I find a job that pays medical and benefits you know?  So you have to do what you have to for survival.

On a side note its been a really tough year since October's post.  I lost my newphew, my little sister and my father all within about 8 months of each other.  We expected my father but not my sister or her son.  Very sad and it really broke my family unfortunately ..so there is a lot of healing that has to happen to get us all back on track.

In the meantime ..how is everyone else out there in cyberland?  Feel free to say hello.  Take care and see you again.

"event","Its been six weeks since my last confession ..oops.. .I mean posting ...

Still alive and kicking.  Thought I should post an update since I don't call or write as often as I should or would like to .. I used to love getting on the computer at home after work but when you do it all day for a living ..I hate sitting at home waiting for my crappy dial up to load ..so I don't get on as much as I used to.

I'm in the middle of so many things right now ..... the old Yinepu site I had over on Homestead is gone ..and I'm trying to learn Dream Weaver 4 so I can rebuild it (better and stronger than it was ..oh ..wrong movie) over on Cedant.  I have parked the new site name and won't give it away ..it hadn't been thought of before this and I think its going to be very nice when its all said and done. The new site will have much more content and I'll be doing my own research and fact finding but of course will give credit when its due (for pictures, work or other research as well as graphics).

On the home front ..looking for work ..still on disability but that will end now and I'll be on unemployment while I'm looking for work.  Its been tough to find anything out in Riverside which sucks big time ..and I've jumped through all the hoops for Riverside County and the State ..but want to try for San Bernardino as well.  Or ..perhaps I should say screw the legal field and go for property managment (I've done that in my past as well and it would be nice to find a small place that I could manage in return for free rent and/or small salary) or try getting into administrative or executive type work (personal assistant etc.).  

My knees are still hurting and the shots have not worked that I can see yet.  It can be weeks for the effects to take hold but having to go thru the series of very painful injections was not fun and having no relief isn't helping my stress level :P  I will not be able to do anything for awhile until I'm employed FT again and have insurance ..but thankfully I got the dental work done that I put off for the last few years.

There are happy things to report though ...

For the folks out there in southern CA area ...there are a shitload of lectures coming up in the next few months on Maya if you are interested :)  There is a FREE lecture on October 15, 2008 at 7p at the Beckman Center in Irvine.  The speaker is none other than Michael Cole (Breaking the Maya Code).  He is here along with a plethora of other very famous Maya scholars for that weekend's symposium (October 17, 2008).  I was stunned to get an invitation to the private reception the Friday night before the lecture, The next day is open to the Public.  If you go to the Saturday session the cost covers the breakfast, the lecture and material, the lunch ..and a fab dinner with the guest speaker from Yale.  If you can go to this I'd really recommend it as I know there will be some authentic 'surprises' at this symposium.  I will be working the registration that morning :)

I've met such a fantasic group of folks that call themselves the  ""New World Archeology Council"".  I'm a member of the Orange County group.  They are so much fun ..and the folks and connections they have are amazing.  I've been privilged to be able to attend functions and meet the archeologists and scholars in person and get to discuss one of my other favorite subjects.  

Along with the local ARCE chapter here in Orange County my free time is full with attending lectures, exhibits and musuem openings (and most of them are absolutely FREE).  I would very much like to sign up for a class at UCLA this next year if I can swing it (either a Archeology course or Middle Egygptian).

Since I'm not working full time yet and doing contract work I'm squeezing out a week to go see the kids up in Alaska.  Yes ..I know I said I would never do it again in the winter but the circumstances are long and boring but suffice to say my family sucks when it comes to taking care of my kids or grandkids so I'm flying up to spend the time with my grandbabies while my daughter and son in law are in Hawaii for a week with Chandra's dad.  It will be good for her to spend time with him and I'll enjoy the week with the boys by myself.  Of course the other good thing ..is that they have one of the Nintendo Wii's!!!  I only got to play it for a few hours the first time I saw it last year..this time Grandma is going to be playing all night after the boys go to bed :P  I will be back in town on the 15th and then will have other company visiting from out of town :)  

I'm not planning anything else for this year that I'm aware of but you never know what can happen ..its a new Year for us Kemetic folks :)

Hope all is well in cyberland for you all.

My law firm has lost its biggest paying client (aka the car company that was paying my firm to do their discovery work for the legal suits)  and the ironic part of this ..is that they lost it to a rival firm that we do business with as well!  That goes to show you that the way they treated the employees (not well) is the way they treated their clients - disorganized, lack of communication and no one knowing what the hell the other half was doing.  It showed in the constant review of billing I did every month because stuff was not corrected from the month before and the client got tired of our constant screwups and staff turnover we've had since I joined said law firm :P

So ..I've been out on disability leave for the last two months and I found out by a co-worker's good-bye email to the team that this was happening.  I also found out that some of the partners (the ones I worked for) were aware of this going down but of course never said a word to anyone (they never do) and only some of the team (the clerical staff that supports the 7 attorneys) was asked to go to the new firm to work on the new team.  

Since I was not notified (and I'm still waiting on my firm's HR folks to get back with me) I'm assuming that I'm not going to the new firm (which is ok by me since the new office is located in downtown Los Angeles and there is NO way I'm making that god awful commute). I'm hoping that they will now just cut me loose and let me go since my attorneys are no longer with the firm and there really isn't any work for me to do now ..so I'd like to just walk away with a nice severance package and collect unemployment until I find another job closer to home.

I will wait until they come to me before I go to the labor board :)  I was unhappy there for some time due to the work loads and lack of assistance and of course there is all the stress that they put me through ..enough to have my doctor pull me off the job until they fixed it (which they had not even up until the firm was let go from the account) so there is no love loss here.  The best I could get would be the pink slip and a good refernce (and a small severence package would be nice but I'm not counting on it).

Other than that ..I'm in round two of the knee injections.  No relief that I can feel yet and the knees are hurting like hell and spasms more now than before the shots but I've got one more week of treatment and then I wait to see if it helped.  I didn't know until this week that the shots were $300 each (and I'm doing both knees for three weeks).  I had to get the ok from the insurance company before I could start the treatment.  Its the synthetic gel (Euflexxa) that I'm getting injected into my knees to replace the lubricant that is missing (I'm bone to bone).  Its better than surgery and I'm exploring all the other options first :P

Talk with you later.  Have a good week.

Hanging out today.  The weather has been in the mid 90's to low 100's here.  I'm going to lay by the pool for a little while today.  Since I pay an arm and leg for my 660sq ft box (aka my apartment) I might as well use what they charge me for :P  I'm hanging out because I'm still sore from the injections into my knees (long story short - trying different methods to see if I can get the mobility back in my knees since the arthritis has reduced me to bone on bone).  I'm on a new drug called ""Euflexa"" which is a snythetic gel that takes the place of the body's own 'gel' and gives the patient up to 1 year of relief.  You have to go thru a series of three treatments (one in each knee per week for three weeks) and I've just started since the medicine had to be pre-ordered and did not arrive in time for me to do the treatment before I left for retreat so that's why I'm doing it now.

I took a short drive yesterday (an hour out) and sat in the middle of the 'quiet' desert.  The temperature was about 108.  I'm nuts I know but I love the hot dry weather. It was hot while I was in Chicago but accompanied by that awful humidity!  Who likes to be dripping wet the minute you step outside?  not me :P  The dry heat is the best.    

I had gone out to the desert to think about things and what the Gods had said to me this year regarding what I'm going to do with my life. I saw cindercones, lava flows and huge sand dunes! I was surprised a few times and took it as a good sign (both times).  The first time I was driving off the dirt road leading from the Kelso Dunes (big sand dunes located in the heart of the Mohave Desert Preserve) and stopped to take a picture.  When I looked down into the wash I noticed something odd ..and thought why would folks throw their grapefruits out here?  It turned out to be 4 long strands of desert gourds!  I had heard that they grow in the desert but had only seen it once before when I was friends in Las Cruces and we were out hiking and found a branch of them.  The gourds were in different stages of decay but I pulled off the good ones (and took pics before and after) and threw them in the back of the car and brought them home.   I want to do something special with them but not sure what.

The second time I was sitting at one of the rest areas admiring the lava flows (the lava flow came down through the valley and is actually all over the rest area) when I heard a voice in my head (male) tell me to take 4 of the little cinder pieces home.  I was to use them for creating and building for this year and to set them up in the 4 corners of my apartment.  I will do that later today after I do the rite.  Some kind of good heka perhaps?

Anyway got to run.  Hope you all have a good week."

"event","Happy Wep Ronpet (aka Happy New Year to the non-kemetic folks here)! 

You are probably saying to yourself where the heck have I been?&nbsp; Long story short - &nbsp;Busy with the job and health stuff.&nbsp; Its been forever since I posted.&nbsp; This last year took its toll on a lot of people.&nbsp; It was a Bawy year which meant that we had to get stuff in order and&nbsp;deal with things that had&nbsp;been&nbsp;put off or swept under the rug.&nbsp; For myself I had a few that came back with a bang.&nbsp; I will try to be more consistent this year since its supposed to be a good year for building and creating (per the Aset Oracle this year). 

Been off work for a few months on disability.&nbsp; I tried to work things out with them but they didn't want to listen so my doctor took me off on stress until they reshuffle some of my workload and get my desk caught up (no temp to do my work while I was out they just let it keep piling up and when I tried a two week part time session in June I walked into 6 weeks&nbsp;of work that didn't get done and they just kept piling it on top of the huge stack on my desk each day ...so I&nbsp;said nope ..not going to do it again as what you are asking is unreasonable) and I went off again full time for a few months so I can get my sanity back :P 

So I've been destressing and looking for another job closer to home in the meantime.&nbsp; With the price of gas and the long commute and the ongoing&nbsp;stress issue with the current job its just not cost effective anymore for me to keep driving to Newport Beach every day.&nbsp; My commute is 70 miles each day without any side trips to the store or errands.&nbsp; I think gas is down to like $4.05 here in Corona but that's still to damn high! 

On a happier note&nbsp;I got to attend the House of Netjer retreat this year.&nbsp; I missed it in 2007 and you really can't miss many of them when you've got your obligations (priest) so I made sure I got there for 2008.&nbsp; It was a lot of&nbsp;fun and this had to be the biggest group we've had so far (or at least the 8 retreats I've&nbsp;attended).&nbsp; Its always&nbsp;great to put names with a face and then I&nbsp;remember who they are after that.&nbsp; Some of the folks that came&nbsp;are ones that I've been talking to for years on the internet but had not met in person.&nbsp; This year there were 16 new folks that I had not met.&nbsp; We all got along so well and each event was a&nbsp;big success.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

We had workshops, meditations, rituals and&nbsp;one of the most kick ass thunder and lightening storms that I have ever seen!&nbsp; It came of course on Set's birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a show.&nbsp; I've not seen the likes of that ever.&nbsp; It was worth the group of us dancing in the rain and lightening outside the hotel's front entrance that night (although we did get weird looks from the other guests and employees).&nbsp; We also had&nbsp;one of the best raffle/auctions I think we've ever had.&nbsp; Of course I have to say that I do give credit to the jackals for this success (it just turned out that way honest we didn't rig a thing [or did we?].&nbsp; Thanks to my fellow jackals for a job well done. 

I also received my elevation this year.&nbsp; Its hard to believe I've been here this long.&nbsp; The time has gone by but it has done so&nbsp;at a steady pace.&nbsp; I've lost track of how many beginner groups I've worked with or how many folks I've counseled ..but I know that I've met&nbsp;some very special people along my way and I'm grateful every day that I'm with the House and have the opportunity to serve my parent, my community and my King.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year I asked for help and got a new beloved.&nbsp; She is the one that can heal what I&nbsp;need healed.&nbsp; 


Gotta run for now.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Senebty!"

"event","Just a quick note to say ...still working same contract job (started the week of Thanksgiving).  Somehow I let myself get so run down and tired while the kids were here (I was working in between playing tour director for the kids for the two weeks they were here) that the germ just slammed me :-( Everyone at the office where I'm working has been sick and out sick for the last month and passing it around like a fruit cake :P

I've had it since Friday.  Went home and went to bed.  I didn't do anything for the whole time ..I've been in bed ..So I missed work yesterday/today and still not feeling better.  Its moving from my throat down to my chest and I'm starting to cough.

Christmas is next week and this year is one of the crappiest money wise as there isn't anything extra for anyone including donations to any charity this year.

I'm doing the best I can but the last 18 months has been tough and its still not exactly where I want to be but I'm thankful for so much this year even if there isn't anything extra. My bills get paid which is more than most folks this time of year.  I am blessed regardless.

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays - whatever you celebrate do it joyfully :)

May Netjer bless you and grant you all a prosperous 2007.

"event","Hey all

Sorry its been so long since the last post.  The prior law job was frying my brain.  I was assigned to 3 attorneys and they worked us like dogs (no pun intended).  I was learning a lot but it was hard going and more than I've ever had to do before as legal secretary.  This was one of the hardest jobs I've had to 'walk into' with no training whatsoever.

I has just finished my 30 probation about a month or so ago.  Things were going ok I thought until last Thursday when the bastards called me in with a hour to go and said ""Its just business don't take it personally but we need to 'cut you loose' and we just can't take the time to train you like we promised we would.""  Just like that.... I was let go.  They felt bad after they told me that as I looked him in the eye and said well you've pretty much F***** me for the holidays and the rest of this year.  They offered to let me come in a few hours a day for a few days to help them catch up on 'overflow' work.  I had initially said I could use the hours but then after thinking about it over the weekend I thought to myself ""Why the hell should I do them any favors? They sure didn't do me one.""  So I went in on Tuesday and said thank you but no thank you.  I'll be packing up my desk and you can send Terri over to watch and make sure I don't take anything that does not belong to me or try to sabotage the network.  They didn't send anyone to watch me pack.  Some of my friends came over to my desk and said they were so sorry and hoped we could stay in touch ..some I will...most I won't :P

Damn and double damn!  Has Corporate America gotten so out of touch with humanity and reality that they can fire you right before the holidays, right before your kids and grandbabies show up for 2 weeks and with no notice or severance pay?  Apparently they can :P

So..I'm unemployed as of last Thursday.  I've got a temp job to work next week for 2.5 days (they will close early on Wed and then they are closed for Thanksgiving and the Friday after it).  I'm looking for a job closer to home or one that I can commute via train (I really don't want to fork out the extra money for gas and toll road fees) and a part time job as well.  

I'll work as much as I can with the kids here and take the few days I had originally planned to go with them to sight see.  I'm so looking forward to them visiting.  It will be cramped ...3 adults and two little ones in my small one bdrm apt but it will be fun I hope :)

I could use all of your prayers and good thoughts.   

I took the Tarot card test and got the Moon ...duh...like I didn't see that coming :P   I am the MOOON :PPP

But it should also be remembered that this is a card of great creativity, of powerful magic, primal feelings and intuition. You may be going through a time of emotional and mental trial; if you&nbsp;have any past mental problems, you must be vigilant in taking your medication but avoid drugs or alcohol, as abuse of either will cause them irreparable damage. This time however, can also result in great creativity, psychic powers, visions and insight. You can and should trust your intuition.</font></p>

"event","Did you know that there is a subway that runs underneath downtown Los Angeles??
 
I didn't :P   Found out yesterday when I met up with a friend to hang out.  We found out by accident from the clerk in the little store in the lobby of the hotel.  We were asking how far to Union Station and Olvera Street.
 
We walked a few blocks from the hotel and there right in the middle of the concrete jungle was the entrance to the alleged subway - right under a new remodeled apartment building (corner of Flower and Wilshire).  
 
We went down and then down two more levels to catch the red line that took you to Union Station.  3 stories underneath the streets?  Man I had no idea that it was there.  I think some of it has been there for a long time but the new construction going through will link downtown with Hollywood, Antelope Valley and the backside of Riverside county.  It currently runs to Long Beach and Pasadena too :)
 
That was my first time ever in a subway!  I thought it was pretty cool but you couldn't see much as it was dark most of the way.  The stations were decent and since we were in the middle of the day and there were some crowds we had no problems.  
 
We got off at Union Street and wandered through the station checking stuff out.  They just don't make those kind of buildings anymore you know?  The huge vaulted ceilings, the polished floors, all the wood counters, chairs and tables.  It was awesome.  I had to sit in the leather chairs (the whole station is leather chairs at the main entrance) to check them out. From there is was a five minute walk over to Olvera Street.
 
I've been wanting to check this place out since I got here.  Its the original location (you folks who know your CA history correct me if I'm wrong) where folks settled in downtown Los Angeles.  Its very heavily spanish influenced and there is an old mission that sits on the plot.  I think it was called our Lady of Los Angeles (I'll check with my friend for the exact name). It was one of those old beautiful churches.  I love to go inside. look at the pictures, icons and feel all the good vibes they give off.  
 
We went into this one and it was stunning.  Huge gold leaf framed pictures up front behind the main alter.  To the right and left of the alter were two huge pictures of the Madonna, one side with her wearing one of those christian crowns and the other side she was not (I don't know the significance of that).  We went in and bowed and sat down on one of the pews up by the front.  
 
Whenever I go into those places I always pray.  Sometimes I hear things sometimes I don't :)  This time I did.  I started with my normal prayer and when I got to the end of it I heard a voice (I think it was guy) say ""You're not one of mine""?  I almost laughed out loud.  I explained that I was not but I came into pray and check out the church and I hoped I did not offend anyone with praying to my Gods.  I heard the voice say No it was ok and ""They"" didn't mind that we were there.  :)   It was at that time I noticed there was a little shrine on the wall behind the alter and below the pictures.  It was the kind of box that was glass on the front so you could see the object inside (which appearead to be some sort of oil container or something along those lines), the kind of box that would hold a piece of something holy like a bone or body part from a saint :)

So now I need to know who and what is buried in that little box behind the alter. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I might do that?  I'm pretty sure that's where the voice was coming from but I could be wrongg.
 
The rest of Olvera Street was great.  Its like being in Tijuana or any of the border towns.  The prices were much higher though and I didn't get very much.  I did find some nice little stuff for the Great Pumkin exchange.  We found some great material for the Day of the Dead Festival. I should have bought it then but I procrastinated and didn't.  It was on black with all sorts of skeletons doing stuff on the Day of the Dead.  I'd really like to go back there that weekend for the big festival.  They have lots of shops and one shop in particular we took a picture of the ""Ofrende"" [sp] which was so beautiful.  I could spend way too much money on all the skeleton items in those shops. We saw a shitload of sugar skulls but I'm not sure how well those would ship so I didn't buy any :-(
 
From there we took the subway back to the hotel.  On the way we found a delightful cigar store ...and yes we went in and impressed the male owner with our finess on cigars (well we just bullshitted our way actually).  We bought a few that we smoked later that evening.
 
We got back to the hotel and had a light dinner.  From there we wandered up to the roof (this hotel has a bar/lounge on the roof with a small heated pool).  I think we were like 14 stories up (as the elevator only went to 12 and then you got off and walked up two flights of stairs) and up top was this great little bar.  The hotel has been refitted in 60's retro style.  I kept expecting Mike Meyers aka Austin Power to show up at any time!  The outside portion of the lounge had these red chairs that looked like huge red hershey kisses....and they were hollow inside so you could sit in them. Well we go over trying to look cool and sit down on the chairs....shit..they were waterbeds!  My friend gets in and out with no damage...I on the other hand sit down and the bed is not full so my side goes down under the lip of the chair and we spend the next 5 minutes trying to drag me out of the damn chair without making a scene :PPP  

Finally my friend looks up at everyone that is looking at us ..and says ""IT sucks to be getting old""  :PPP OMG's ..I was so embarrassed we got out of there real quick.  We moved on to the blue chais lounges that were spread around the outside of the lounge.  You could lay on them all the way back and look up at the buildings that were all around us and so much taller.  We were a few blocks from the US Bank Tower (tallest building in downtown LA) and the view was so great!  We took a few pics and they turned out so we'll post them when we can as they also qualify for a SW gathering photo :)  We both decided that while it was fun to come into the city this was not the lifestyle either of us could live 24/7.  We retired for the evening after watching our very ..very missed cable TV.  

I left around 11:30 this morning and it took me about an hour or so to get home.  I unpacked and promptly crawled into bed and got a 3 hour nap.  I got up ran to the store, did my chores and I just finished updating my resume and posting it again on Monster.com.  I'm looking for a part time job for awhile so I can catch up on my bills.  I'm behind from the week off at retreat and then this last payday it really hurt as I missed 3.5 days from one pay period.  Gods...I just want to be able to live my life without worrying about money and stressing you know?? I don't want a zillion dollars..just enough to pay my obligations and go on vacation at least once a year..to me that would be the good life :) Anyway..I digress...
 
If you get a chance to get into downtown Los Angeles ..check out the hotel its called The Standard.  Its on the corner of 5th and Flower.  Right downtown Los Angeles and minutes from the subway and all the cool stuff.

Hope everyone has a great week.  Don't work too hard.

"event","I've had a horrible migraine since yesterday afternoon.  I took my meds went to bed early yesterday (and no cleaning or lifting). I woke up around 3:30a this morning to screaming pain.

I got up took more meds and went back to bed.  I did not want to call in since I was out 3 days last week with the torn ligament.  I got up at 7a and had to take more pain meds.

I went into the office feeling like shit and hurting like hell.  By 11a I couldn't take it anymore.  When I get these I can't have any light sound etc otherwise I will get sick.

Well I got sick ...and that was that ...I had to go tell my supervisor I needed to go home.  I explained the whole back thing (while its out of alignment and bone twisted ...it pushes against my spinal cord which causes horrendous migraine and back pain).  I made sure my job was not in jeapordy (I just made it past probation but I've been out about a week total this past 3.5 months with my stomach (IBS) and back.  Not really good but I am unable to do anything about it until I see the doctor on Oct 12 (my insurance kicks in on Oct 1) and can get this stablized by therapy and/or acupunture (I'm going to give it a try).

So..I drove home with my hands locked around my head (to dull the throbbing) and promptly climbed into bed before noon and did not move until about a half hour ago.  I did not take any more meds after 7a this morning as I was afraid I'd get even more sick.  

I'm up for a little while but the pain in my back and neck feels like my back is so tight it will snap if I move the wrong way.  I can still feel the dull thudding/throbbing in my head but I'm hoping it won't go back into another migraine.

Any prayers you can send my way would be much appreciated.  Thanks for listening."

"event","Today was a good day in spite of my pain factor (from the torn ligament).

I slept in and took my time getting ready to go to the lecture this afternoon over in Laguna Niguel.

The speaker this time was Dr. Richard Fazzini from the Brooklyn Musuem.  He talked about the recent excavations at the Mut complex in the Karnack Temple.  He did a great job of presenting and had some wonderful slides to show up as well.

I learned all kinds of cool stuff like the Mut temple had been rebuilt completely 3 to 4 times (per Dr. Fazzini) and that the last building project happened during the Ptolemic and Roman occupations and it has (on the rear of the complex proper on the outside of the temple wall) roman and ptolemic glyphs on the blocks!

After the lecture was over I headed home and sat in traffic for about an hour before I made it to my turn off and got to the house.  I was going to go grocery shopping but thought I'd stop by the house first and check messages and feed the critters.

Good thing I did :)  I had a phone message from a friend who left this very cryptic message on my machine about having dinner with a mutual friend.    I phoned her back and got the details and then jumped in my car and headed over to Pasadena.  We all met up in Pasadena and then headed over to Wahib's [sp] where we spent the next 4 hours eating, talking, laughing and listening to the live middle eastern band complete with live bellydancers.

I had a great time and it was totally unexpected but it made my day!  Thank you for the lovely dinner my friends and the excellent conversation :)  

I look forward to doing it again in the future.

On a side note...still in a shit load of pain from the torn ligament.  When I sleep I have to wear my wrist braces to keep my arms from locking up but its not really helping as I twist up so bad once I finally fall asleep that I wake up a few hours later in horrible pain from lying on my arms or wrists :P

I see the doctor on Oct 12 so I'm trying to maintain until then.

Next weekend I have to go shopping at the Disney store for the grandbaby (well he's 4 now) and get him the Red Mystic Power Range costume with the SWORD :P  He told me he wants to be the red one this year and needs the sword too :P"

"event","I'm home ....I was out yesterday as well.  I've been in so much pain from my back and neck (and specifically my right hip again) that I've been trying to self medicate myself with over the counter aspirin, ibuprofen, advil etc.  Its not done squat except to tear up my already fragile insides :-(

I couldn't stand the pain any longer today and was on my way into the office but called my supervisor and told her there was no way I could do a 9 hour shift and sit all day and bend over and aggravate my back in my condition.

She told me I needed to go to the doctor.  So I scraped up my last bit of money I had to get me through until next payday and used it to go to the urgent care walk in clinic. No wonder I hurt like hell - I tore a ligament in my back a while back and cleaning/moving furniture this weekend tweaked it out of control and my level of being able to self medicate.

So for now...back on the Vicodin and Soma until my insurance kicks in (Oct 1, 2006) and I can get into the regular doctor and have him manage me so I can get the MRI's and the tests for the rheumatoid arthritis and check my osteomyelitis again (bone infection).  I've paid dearly with my health since I left AK and no insurance since March 2005.

I hope I can get through all of this. With that said..I've got to go lay down ..can't sit too long.

"event","Hello to all of you out there in cyberland :)

I've been so busy that I've not posted for awhile so thought I better put something out there.

The job is good but very stressful and so busy I don't have time to take a potty break most days (yes TMI I know).  I've been assigned to 3 attorneys which is the most I've ever had to work for (usually one or two max). 

They are working my ass off and I'm so exhausted by the time I get off work, fight the ever growing traffic and longer commutes I don't have the energy to do much.

The good news?  I'll finally have full coverage insurance again as of October 1, 2006.  I'm choosing Health Net over Kaiser and Blue Cross of Washington. Its a decent plan...no deductibles!! Dua Netjer!!

I read the Anchorage Daily News each day so I can keep up with what's happening in my home town.  Tonite I read another article on global warming that caused me great distress.  For those that know me...I've been whining about this for years and most folks think I'm full of shit but here...go read the article...see the map of where the ice is retreating and then tell me that its not real!! Damn mankind for living its life in blinders.  We are destroying Mother Earth/Father Geb and its time for us to take a stand and say NO MORE.  We need to tell our senators and congressmen that this is NOT acceptable and to stop polluting our world :-(

http://www.adn.com/news/environment/story/8191457p-8085098c.html


On a brighter note:  My daughter has decided not to go to Jamaica due to price increases (Dua Netjer for that too as she's not real travel sauvy and I admit I was worried) but to come here for 10 days with the whole family (my son-in-law and the two grandsons).  While it will be cramped and a little stressful I'm so excited to see them all including my son-in-law.  This could be a great opportunity for me to do some serious talking with them both and to try and mend the past rocky relationship between us (I don't think he really ever recovered after I caught them having sex the first few times and telling him if he took it out of his pants for the next 30 days [while she was getting on the pill] I would have no problem with cutting it off and taking care of the problem myself (yes..I know ..aggresive jackel).

so for now ..staying out of trouble and working on taking off more weight.  I'm getting there slowly and noticing more men (well young men 22- 26)are hitting on me. WTF?  I like the attention but gotta tell you ...no intention of sleeping with someone younger than my children :PP

I'm waiting for the right time and the right guy to come and sweep me off my feet (well pick me up over his shoulder and we run away to a jungle tent or a deserted island).  Yinepu said he would send me one when the time was right ..so I'm waiting :)

Going to take another hike this weekend (now that its cooled down to the mid 80's) up at the Devils Punchbowl.  Its a awsome park about a hour north of me up by Palmdale and Lancaster (have to drive up by Barstow and then head west).  Its a great park that has the most awesome rock formations I've ever seen :-)  Here is the link for the park.

www.devils-punchbowl.com

They do full moon hikes (and no lights allowed) as well as meteor shower viewing which starts in October.  That is so romantic.  I'd really like to share that with someone special one of these days.

Ok..gotta run for now and head to bed.  I'm just fried and I need all the brain power for the day to get thru the job.

Love you all.

"event","I attended the lecture last night titled:

In Sands Forgotten:  New Abu Sir cemetary of the Vanishing Old Kingdom Pharaohs.""
Speaker:  Mirsolav Barta

I learned shit I had no idea about!  Did you know that during the 5th & 6th dynasties that there were at least 20 mortuary cults going on?  That the said mortuary temples were bleeding the land dry (due to the huge number of offerings that were given on a daily basis)?  I was fascinated!  He was a great speaker and at the end I got to ask the very last question.  I asked about a picture he had shown that has the sand removed to show a last meal that was buried in the tomb for the deceased.  The offerings on the tomb wall are EXACTLY what was found buried intact inside the tomb (so far they have only excavated about 5% of the cemetary - there is still a huge shitload of tombs that are lying undiscovered).  The offerings of food were placed inside some of the most beautiful carved limestone containers I've ever seen.  The one containing the duck/goose had a beautiful fowl carved on the cover of the container...simply exquisite!  I always get so much out of the lectures.  I think I've died and gone to heaven (well sorta) to be able to have the opportunity to follow my dream of being able to meet these folks and attend the lectures!  

For anyone that can get out here...these ARCE lectures are separate from the ones that are being held over at the Bowers Museum over in Santa Ana.  The ARCE lectures are put on by the Orange County public library folks.  These lecture are FREE...frickin FREEEEEEEEE

Here is the upcoming schedule for anyone that might be out here :)  You're welcome to hook up with me and attend!

Sept 25 
Dr. Richard Fazzini, Brooklyn Museum - Recent Excavations by the Brooklyn Museum at the Mut Temple at Karnak.

Oct 28
Dr. Benson Harer, ARCE Board of Governors - The Real Cause of Tutankhamen's Death - The New CT Scan Analyzed.

Dec 16
Dr. Donald Ryan, Pacific Lutheran University - Return to the Valley of the Kings 
AND
Dr. Otto Schaden, University of Memphis - The Discovery and Excavation of KV 63.

If this does not tempt your palette...then how about a Mayan symposium?  I was sent this special invite as I've met the folks from the New World Archeology :)  I've met the man that is talking about the San Bartolo murals (he gave a lecture last year at the LACMA) and then we saw the Mayan exhibit which was absolutely spectactular!!!  I'm going to try to go to this one if I can :) This one is on Saturday, October 21, 2006 in Irvine, CA.  Here is the link.

Hope you all have a great week and are doing something cool for the upcoming Holiday weekend!  Be good to yourselves and Netjer bless :)

BTW - the new pic is from the concert last weekend. I was trying hard not to laugh :P"

"event","Oh hell yes she did!   I went to the best concert I think I've ever been to!

I had a ticket to see (all in one night):   Violent Fems, Cheap Trick, Billy Idol, Journey and Def Leppard!!!  OMG's...........

It was so awesome.  I had a great time and screamed my lungs out as well as danced in place for like 3 hours straight.  There were about 9,000 folks (or whatever the max is over at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater) on Saturday along with me.

I screamed like I was 21 again (must have been the group of 21'ers next to me).  When Billy Idol took off his shirt and did his signature sneer I thought...god damn...he still looks good after 15 years!  Watching Cheap Trick play I realized how far I've come and how much I've changed since I left Alaska.  Both the singers still could strut their stuff and the one singer (I can't remember his name) was awfully sexy with the long hair and his naked chest (yeah ok ...it was a sex feast what can I say ..we are talking some of the hottest men in rock n roll today  - I can't help myself).  

I had heard Journey and Cheap Trick back in Alaska ...20 years ago plus for both bands (so now I've given my age away).  While Steve Perry was not singing with Journey last night the new lead guy was so frickin awesome I'm sorry but he gave Steve Perry a damn good run for his money.  :P  I think his name was Steve something?  He had more stage presence than Mr. Perry...way more..I found myself drooling over him too :P

Then Def Leppard was on stage.  I was swooning by then.  The two thin blond singers were to die for.  When the one took his shirt off ..it was hard not to imagine him and a boat cruising down the Nile and the lead singer...sexy enough to gobble up and lick your lips for more....sigh...... I told the kids ...if they are still playing when they are 56 I'm damn well still going to their concerts.  

Even though I was alone I was never really alone :)  People came and went next to me throughout the next 11 hours.  I just can't say how much fun I had.  There were airplanes flying around the arena towing signs from the local radio station that had sponsored the event (Jack 93.1) with all kinds of hilarious sayings like ""We are not seeing enough Nudity on the lawn"".   ""While you're here we are robbing your house"".  The best was when the Goodyear Blimp showed up and flashed the message that Billy Idol had been displaced and if anyone saw him please bring him back to the stage area :)  I was up on the top of the arena on the lawn.  It was sloped downward so as the night wore on and people got drunker most folks couldn't make it up or down the hill without falling and crashing into folks around them.  I finally left as Def Leppard was wrapping up with Rock of Ages!  


Sunday was a bit hard to wake up to after Satuday night but once I was up and dressed and on my way out the door (to pick up Ma'ai) I slowly woke up.  We were heading down to San Diego to see Weshebut and Besai.  This was the first time Ma'ai and I had met Besai.  As always its tough for anyone to meet new folks but it goes without saying that once you see a face and put the name to it you don't forget them :)

So we had quite an adventure.  After sailing down Interstate 5 we arrived in San Diego with no mishaps.  We found Weshebut mom's house and picked her up and headed over to pick up Besai after that.  We only had a map to Weshebut's house (handwritten directions so I think we did a good job of getting around and Besai and Ma'ai were clever to use their cell phones for help with directions).  We took off from Besai's house and proceeded to chat and ask questions all through the day :)    First was the gift and book store.  I found a nice little pewter statue of Serqet (like the ones that were at the raffle for Retreat this year) and incense.  We did a lot of oohing and aahing while we were there.

From there we headed out to the bead store but on the way to and from we had passed a very cool egyptian style building so on the way back I whipped into the street in front of the building and we all piled out and walked around to see the building. I found a man inside that could tell us a little about it.  He had lived there for about 15 years and when he first moved in he said there were those 'little dog things' on each side of the walkaway.  One night he came home to find theives stealing them :-(  I think it was built back in the 30's or so with the kitchy thing about Egypt was a big thing.  It had a winged disk over the door as well as papyrus columns complete with a man's head.  The name of the original building was the Egyptian Garage.  Besai and Ma'ai got pictures.

From there we had seen a temple complete with the ornate roof, statues around the outside, the painted walls (either Hindu, Buddist or Laotian).  I drove down the street and around the building but we could not see anyway to get in or that it was open.  I'd really like to see the inside of that place as well!  The outside as Besai said..was simply stunning :)

From there we hit General Bead Company.  Weshebut picked out some beads and endings and Ma'ai and I picked out a new silver pendant (with the ankh in the middle with a lotus flower on each side of the ankh).  The lady working there had brought her adorable little dog with her but I can't remember what kind it was :P  We threw the ball for the little critter and played with her while we waited for each other.

From there it was growing late afternoon so we headed out to find a Indian restaurant which never materialized so we settled on Chinese buffet at that point as we were all hungry (I was starving by then).  We ate dinner and chatted and after it was over the front desk lady was nice enough to take our picture :)

From there we took Besai home, dropped off Weshebut and Ma'ai and I headed back up Interstate 5 for the ride home.  Gods..the traffic was awful!  It took us about 3.5 to get thru most of it and we arrived safely at Ma'ai's house.  I didn't get home until around 10:30 or 11:00 and I was so tired I could barely crawl into bed.  Tonite I'm SO going to bed early.

Besai has some time off coming up and we've all invited her to our neck of the woods for a visit to the incredible EVIL...EVIL Ancient Artistic Lands in Alahambra next to our favorite..favorite middle eastern restaurant.  I think she will up to visit :)

No plans for the next week and I've not planned on going anywhere for the upcoming Holiday.

"event","Yesterday Wabet Maainakhtsen and myself attended our very first interfaith service in Simi Valley, CA.  

For those who didn't know the House of Netjer was contacted about a 10 days ago by a woman here in southern CA who wanted to honor the wishes of her very good friend.  We were asked if it would be possible for someone from the House to do a egyptian funeral service for the family and friends. The internet is an amazing place and it just goes to show you how small the world really is.  This person had talked to another person who had talked to another person who eventually referred them to Hemet.

Hemet talked to me prior to retreat to see if I and Ma'ai and Paneb would be interested in putting something together for a service.  When Hemet showed me the link and I saw the picture of the young lady I said yes.  I had met Jaime at Pcon (if it wasn't this year it was one of the years the House had attended Pcon in San Jose).  I called the woman from Chicago on Monday before we headed home.  Alissa told me what they were wanting to do and asked me if I could come up with a service to honor Jamie's wishes.  

I contacted Ma'ai and Paneb to ask if they would like to help with the service.  Ma'ai was available but Paneb was working and could not (and he was very much missed).  For the record...I could NOT have done this without Ma'ai.  She kept me grounded and did an amazing job :)  After the service on the drive back home I asked her if she would be willing to help me with my own death midwifery business that I am working on setting up.  She said yes :) as well as any other funeral requests the House might get in the future.

On the way home on the plane from retreat I started to write the service.  A HUGE thank you to our Nisut (AUS) who worked with me and gave me guidance and feedback on what would be appropriate for the funeral (and also what would have been done in ancient times for the deceased).  I finished my outline by Thursday and ran it by Alissa who liked it and we finalized the arrangements for the service.

So..I will describe the service and my feelings but there are parts here that I can't tell you because I honestly don't remember all of it.  Some of it I can't tell you what happened and a few other parts I remember vaguely seeing myself doing it but it was more like I was going thru the motions and someone else was driving.  Ma'ai will have to fill those parts in for you (and Ma'ai is still not back on line full time due to the move but hopefully she can post in the next few days).

We left for the service early and arrived ahead of time to set up.  We had enough time to sit down and get a cold soda and a bite so we could go over the service.  All the way up we both sang and laughed and practiced the songs so we would be in tune.  Jamie had been dedicated to Bast so we were asked to incorporate Her into the service if possible. Of course my Father was also a part of the service and I had been requested by Him to take a few of his images to put on the table/alter so he could be present.

When we arrived at the House we saw all these people in black.  The only ones that were dressed in white was myself, Ma'ai and the other woman from the Thelemic tradition [who was also going to do a portion of the service].  We introduced ourselves to the hostess (Alissa) and she took us out in the back yard to set up and we talked about what they wanted to do.  Everyone there was so nice and made us feel welcome.  We had planned to sing the Bast song but they asked us if we could do something else as we were out in the back yard of a nice nieghborhood. Thank Gods we had a back up plan and instead we said the beautiful Bast prayer that is in Hemet's new prayer book.

So Ma'ai and I had decided this was going to be the outline for the service:

A quick introduction about us and the House and then open up with the traditional clearing and do the circumnavigation [which ended up being just the two of us in front of the table doing the items around the table as there were too many people {approx 40} for us to move about.  

Next was the 4 prayer libation where we poured cool water.  After that we decided to sing the Wepwawet Song [the prayer that Nakht had put together and Imakhu Senut had put to music].  After that I was going to talk about Jamie's life and the things she was involved in.   From there we were going to break and let Melody do her Thelemic portion and then we would invite folks up to talk about Jaime and share their memories.

After that Ma'ai and I would read the 70 day prayer and explain how it was done in ancient times [we did the prayer for the service but let folks know that traditionally it would not have been done until 70 days had passed.  We also let them know that we would be happy to give it to them if they wanted to say it again on the 70 day mark as well as passing on Hemet's condolences and offer to do the prayer for Jamie's ka on the 70 day mark as well].

We would then break to have a small meal to honor Jamie and folks could sit and talk and make a plate for her as the guest of honor. 

Well that was the script but we had to wing a few of the things but Dua Netjer no-one really noticed the spots where we did that and the service went on without any major hitches.

So when we started I said the introductions...I was so nervous...geez I could barely speak.  I introduced myself and Ma'ai but forget to say that she was a priest as well and didn't pronounce her name exactly right :P  [we decided the next time everyone does their OWN introductions.  I made up for it afterwards by telling Ma'ai I couldn't have done it without her :)  

All the way up to the service I had been praying to Yinepu to help me and to make sure things went smoothly and be there with me.  I know it sounds funky for you that know me but yes I still get nervous speaking in front of people I do not know and this was such an important event I didn't want any screwups so I asked Him to be there with me.

We started the circumnavigation and orginally had it that we would each do two of the items and sing the wab ef pu song while we were doing that.  It didn't exactly turn out like that :)  I had started with the natron water and we were both singing but Ma'ai was very focused and was doing her part but she stopped singing!  oy...I suddenly realized I was singing and I'm one of those folks who can't really sing but I knew we had to so I closed my eyes and kept singing until she finished the light, sound and incense portion.  

We then poured the ritual water, I spoke the words while the lovely Ms. Ma'ai poured the water.  That went great.  From there we broke into the Wepwawet prayer/song.  It sounded beautiful [she has such an amazing voice].  

After that I let folks know that I was going to talk about Jamie and explained that Alissa had been kind enough to send me the information as well as the link to myspace.com where Jamie had posted a bio.  I read from my notes and I could hear folks laughing, crying and making small comments as I went on with the bio.  Thank Gods..Ma'ai knew some of the music that Jamie liked because I had to stop and tell folks that I was sorry if I misprounced any names of the bands but I was not familiar with some of them.  I had them laughing when I said that Jamie liked NIN [what a boob I was...that was supposed to be Nine Inch Nails].  We finished the bio and then had Melody step up to do her portion of the service.

I thought Melody would do something from her tradition formally but she did a great job of talking about Jamie and doing it informally.  She spoke about her for a little while as people cried softly.  She also spread peppermint from Egypt and then lit incense and put that around the alter in the front.  It was very very nice.

She finished with her portion and we invited folks to come up and share their memories if they would like.  Jamie's father was the first to speak.  His words had us all crying.  It was very touching and I could tell he loved her very much and accepted her as is with no judgement.  As he was talking I started to hear Yinepu in my head...he wanted to say some things to the people present.  I had to keep telling him to wait as we had to let the others present do the talking first.  He was getting insistent and it was at that point I leaned over to Ma'ai and told her He had some things he wanted to say to everyone.

This is where things get fuzzy for me.  After everyone finished talking we had planned on doing the 70 day prayer but I had to step forward and tell folks that this was not part of the service but if it was ok my Father had some words he wanted to say to them.  I remember stepping forward and hearing the words come out of my mouth but I can't remember exactly what he said or how the service actually ended.  

He talked to the people present for a few minutes [not very long].  Ma'ai will have to fill you in here...I only remember bits and pieces of what was said but I do remember hearing people crying and I'm assuming whatever he said was appropriate for those present.  

Ma'ai says we went back to the table after that and started to do the 70 day prayer.  We had agreed to do it in pieces so each of us could speak.  I was supposed to take the middle section and the last portion [where the words effectively say the mouth has been opened].  I remember vaguely saying that and feeling like there was a whirlwind of something around us and as we got closer to finishing the prayer the energy and the heka of the words increased.  I also felt very strongly that prior to the service Jamie was not quite aware that she had died but after the service I knew she was aware as she had been there with us.  Her ashes had been placed in a beautiful urn which had been placed on the center of the table in front of us.  [Ma'ai had been ahead of the game enough to bring a bottle of annoiting oil {House of Netjer oil}.  We had asked if it would be ok to take a little of the oil and annoint the urn at the end of the service and the family had given us permission to do so [even though I had no idea before hand that it should be done ..just felt it had to be that way]].

I vaguely remember taking the oil and annoiting the bottom front center of the urn and then doing a deep henu to it and backing away.  Both Ma'ai and myself are not sure exactly how the service ended but afterwards we had people coming up to us shaking our hands and thanking us and telling us what a beautiful service it had been and they were so nice and said thank you for coming.   There were lots of tears and folks hugging but that's a good thing.  We broke to eat but I really wasn't hungry but did drink water and diet coke to get my head back together.  The family and guests made plates for Jamie and placed them on the alter.  We let them know what to do with the food afterwards so it was not wasted.

Ma'ai and I had gone over the list of things to bring to the service and she had provided a beatiful white porclean statute of Bast which we had set on the ground in front of the table and placed colored beads around her neck. Folks left offerings on the cat's neck as well as the table for Jamie.  Ma'ai also loaned me a very nice leopard scarf which I put on under my collar necklace over my punjabi suit so I looked the part.  I need to get one of those.

We are hoping that this service will speak volumes and give the House some pretty awesome PR.  I told Ma'ai that while it was only she and I at the service we also had all of us and our ancestors and Gods with us while we were there. 

Afterwards we went back to Ma'ai's place and had dinner and then sat down and watched the original version of the Wickerman [which I have NEVER seen].  I had the weirdest dreams last night that went back and forth between the funeral service and sections of the movie :P  Oy...anyway...I wanted to put this in writing before I forgot...but as stated...Ms. Ma'ai will have to fill in some of the parts that I don't remember.

I'm very thankful that we were able to do it and I look forward to helping others in the future.

"event","Today I attended a lecture at the Bowers. The speaker was Fadel Gad.  Topic:  The concept of God in Ancient Egypt (but he really didn't talk all that much about it...he wandered off/on the topic and finished it up with the itinary of the upcoming Egypt tour he is taking (Oct 24 - November 8).  He was very interesting and a great speaker. 

I met one of my new friends (Lynn) after I arrived (she has travled to Egypt quite a few times, is a fellow of the Bowers [$500 level membership] and has traveled with some of the best egyptologists on their tours).  She had just come back from Chicago where she got to go to the private shindig at the Field Musuem to open the Tut exhibit.  She got to sit at the table next to Zawi Hawass and Emily Teeter.  After she finished the dinner they got a private tour and lecture!  The next day she had gone to the OI and was given a tour by Emily Teeter.  I'm really glad I met Lynn. She has been awesome about making introductions for me. My list of names gets longer every time I attend one of these events.

I also got to see another guy who I had met last year who is one of the big wigs for the New World Archeology Council and he is very into Maya stuff too!  How sweet is that?? both of the things I love. Russell was nice enough to put me on the mailing list as an honorary member of the council :)  He and the other lady that I was introduced to today are the ones that set up the lecturs/exhibits for the Maya artifacts.  The lady is also the curator of the Southwest Musuem (across from the Los Angeles Zoo) and she invited me down anytime I wanted to come and she would give me a personal tour anytime.  OMG""s...I'm so in like FLINT!

There is a private maya symposium in so cal in October.  They are going to have the archeologists, language experts, glyph readers etc..the best of the best and do a whole day event.  I've been invited to attend!  I think I've died and gone to heaven..no wait..I just pinched myself..still here :)  Ok...well I'm just so blessed and I can't get enough of all of this.  Forget the movie stars...I want to meet the archeologists, eygptologists and the science folks...no meeting a guy in a bar, laudromat or grocery store for me :PPP   I figure by attending and belonging to the ARCE and the Bowers I'm bound to meet someone :)  I'm also considering being a volunteer for the Bowers to give guided tours :)

Other than that...trying to not melt or heatstroke out here.  Its been triple digits for weeks now and its so damn humid its gross!  I hate having to take multiple showers during the day to keep from sweating to death.  

The job is going well..I like it.  I like being in Newport Beach ..I'm about 29 mins from my office to the Pacific Ocean!  Even at the office it was in the high 80's and low 90's this last month.

For the folks who live down here ..there will be some great upcoming lectures in the next 6 months.  If you can get here for one I'd  be happy to be your tour guide :)  www.bowers.org

"event","I say that because today I had to deal with (this is like the 4th time now) bullshit at the pool.  I had company today ..folks I had not seen in a few months.  We were going to do some chatting, swimming, more chatting and a small barbecue.

We got over to the pool and it was crowded. I don't mind the kids and other folks there...what I do mind is that you've brought another 20 of your effing family here...and they are out of control!!  The rules say 2 guests per apartment.  This group consistenly breaks the rules, trashes the pool, playground and laundry areas.  Its like I'm going to use it up and fuck whomever comes in after me...I just don't give a shit.

Well...its not the white folks..its not the black folks..and heck its not the asian ones either...its the hispanics.  I'm biting my lip here to keep from saying anything racist because it wouldn't be fair to judge all hispanics based on what this group does ..but I tell you..its easy to see why they are sterocast like they are.

I and my friends got in the pool...minding our own business and finally after about a half hour of being jumped over and bumped into we moved to the far corner in the deep end and where floating there.  Well then the kids came running down the deck to our end and started to run and jump as hard as they could over our heads or right next to us.  I tried to be polite but I could tell it was beginning to annoy my guests as well and I finally asked the kids to please not jump in next to us.  We were trying to enjoy our end of the pool and I'd appreciate it they could go play on the other end.  I turn around and I'm hit in the back of the head with a ball...that was it ..I threw it back over and told them to keep it away from us.  

Well about then the mom or someone who thought she was something special comes over and starts yelling at us and I said look lady all we are asking for is some courtesy here...they don't have to jump over us and I'm not asking a lot to play somewhere else ...then she tells them to nevermind what I said and its ok to jump over us...they come running over the concrete and jump right over the top of us and start laughing..that was it.  I got out of the water and yelled back at the mom and then to her friends that were with them..saying..I was polite and didn't swear and all I was asking for was a little courtesy..at which point the bitch started up again ...and I said bite me bitch.  We got out of the pool and dried off.

Its been a effing nightmare to get to use the pool or any of the facilities.  This group of 20 apartments insist on taking over the areas for themselves and are rude and very loud.  The rules say 2 guest..2 effing guests per apartment...so I went to the office on the way back to the apartment and threw a fit.  I was polite and didn't raise my voice or swear but I told the new management (they just sold to new owners [who hopefully will enforce some of the rules now]) that I was very angry about not being able to use a facility that I was paying a pretty penny for.  I also told them when they telephoned about a hour later to apologize for the people's behavior that I really didn't want to sign another lease but I didn't want to pay $1035.00 per month (up from $ 895) what an effing rip off..but anyway..they had the security guard out this evening (we waited to go back until all the rejects had left) was asking for the 'pool pass' ...and this family was such a loser..no we don't have one of those..we only have the key..bull shit...they probably crawled over the effing fence and had their kid let them inside the gate (they do that you know).  I'm tired of having everything trashed and this group of folks thinking the world owes them something...NOT EVEN.....

So.....my friends and I agreed that when we were growing up..if we had talked to an adult like they did or acted in such a disrepectful way...I'd would have had the shit knocked out of me by my own parent...where the hell has manners and common courtesy gone?   What would you do (besides move ..which I will after this next lease is up)?  I've had two altercations wtih 2 of the moms in the last few months and both were about their nasty little rude kids..I came so close to just decking both times....but I don't want to get arrested and second..I wouldn't do anything that would jeapordize my position with the House and my friends.

I didn't ask for any trouble today and was so polite and my two friends would back me up here...it was the kids and their 'parent' that were the ones at fault here.  If I were a King...I'd be doing some heaving smiting to rid my country of the problem (and for the record...I'm not raciest ..I'd want to smite whomever was responsible for the unacceptable behavior)  

We were able to salvage the day and had a nice time chatting while the food was grilling. We had chicken and steak along with my home made potato salad :)

Thank you both for coming :)

For the rest of you...have a good week and talk to you all soon."

Next meme:

Here is info on my name..curious..curious...all of my old tarot readings always came out with the number 8! as did my astrology charts???

You entered: Meresinepu 
There are 10 letters in your name.
Those 10 letters total to 53
There are 5 vowels and 5 consonants in your name. 

Your number is: 8 

The characteristics of #8 are: Practical endeavors, status oriented, power-seeking, high-material goals. 

The expression or destiny for #8:
Your Expression is represented by the number 8. The 8 Expression is well-equipped in a managerial sense. You have outstanding organizational and administrative capabilities. You have the potential for considerable achievement in business or other powerful positions. You can expect to receive the financial and material rewards. You have the skill and abilities to establish or operate a business with great efficiency. You have good judgment when it comes to money and commercial matters, and you understand how to build and accumulate material wealth. Much of your success (or lack of it) may come due to your ability (or inability) to judge character. With the number 8 Expression, you exercise sound judgment in most of your affairs; you are realistic and practical in your approach to business matters. 

The positive 8 Expression produces individuals that are very ambitious and goal-oriented. If the 8 energy is not in excess in your makeup, you will no doubt express these traits to some extent. No one has any more energy that a person with the 8 Expression who has a plan laid and is starting to work. No one has any more self-confidence, either. If you are expressing the positive qualities of 8, you are an outstanding manager because you can plan, initiate, and complete projects; you are very dependable and determined. 

As it always happens, there can be too much of a good thing. If you have too much of the 8 energy in your makeup, you may express some of the negative attitudes. A negative 8 can be very rigid and stubborn. Ambition sometimes has a way of becoming over-ambition, and you may express an unreasonable impatience with the lack of progress. If your negative side is showing, you may be too exacting, both of yourself and of others. Sometimes this can even becomes a case of intolerance. 

The number 8 is very materialistic and also very desirous of status and power. Neither of these drives are inherently negative unless they are taken to an extreme. You must avoid the tendency to strain after money, material matters, status, or power, to the detriment of the other important factors in your life. 

Your Soul Urge number is: 9 

A Soul Urge number of 9 means: 
With a 9 Soul Urge, you want to give to others, usually in a humanitarian or philanthropic manner. You are highly motivated to give friendship, affection and love. And you are generous in giving of your knowledge and experience. You have very sharing urges, and you are likely to have a great deal to share. Your concern for others makes you a very sympathetic and generous person with a sensitive and compassionate nature. 

You are able to view life in very broad and intuitive terms. You often express high ideals and an inspirational approach to life. If you are able to fully realize the potential of your motivation, you will be a very self-sacrificing person who is able to give freely without being concerned about any return or reward. 

As with all human beings, you are prone to sometimes express the negative attitudes inherent to your Soul Urges. You may become too sensitive and tend to express emotions strongly at times. There can be significant conflict between higher aims and personal ambitions. You may resent the idea of giving all of the time and, in fact, if there is too much 9 energy in your nature you may reject the idea. You may often be disappointed in the lack of perfection in yourself and others. 

Your Inner Dream number is: 8 

An Inner Dream number of 8 means: 
You dream of success in the business or political world, of power and control of large material endeavors. You crave authority and recognition of executive skills. Your secret self may have very strong desire to become an entrepreneur."

"event","Yes..its true!  I didn't post last week 'cause I didn't want to jinx myself :P

I had three friggin offers last Tuesday!  Just that morning (as I was walking out of the house) I offered cool water and goodies to the Akhu shrine and asked them all for help and said if they did I'm make sure they had cool water and goodies until I join them :)

I had an offer from a large, medium and small firm.  Its either feast or famine for me...its always been that way [scratches head..not sure why?] I finished up all the interviews and sat back and watched them all haggle for me.  I waited for each of them to make me an offer and told them all that I would choose the best one.  

I liked the big firm and I was interviewed twice there ..then I went to the small firm and interviewed at lunch that day and they were on the phone before I got back to the office that day to offer me the job.  I went back that evening to talk to the managing partner who made me an offer.  I let him know I had two other interviews to do and I'd get back with him.  In the meantime I had started a contract job on 6/8 [the day my aunt left and flew home] that was supposed to last a few weeks.  Once I got in there..I realized that it was a nice place..the secretaries all got along nicely and there was a good group of folks there and all of the managing partners were younger than me!!  I shit you not...there was a time when the secretaries were younger than their attorneys but that's changed.  This place all of the attorneys were younger than the secretaries [all 6 of us].  There was no screaming or yelling and no eggshell walking [like the last job I had quit for the managing partner].  

I was assigned to work with two young attorneyes [only associate level not a partner] one guy and one girl.  They were both so nice.  I started with basic transcription and then up to pleadings, filings etc.  Even though you all remember I'm not that familiar with CA law yet ...the attorneys went to my supervisor and said they really liked me and they wanted me to stay as did two other attorneys (who I had helped the last week with some small tapes].  I had my two agencies doing all the bargaining for me [the agencies get a pretty penny when they contract one of their employees (like if I got paid $20 they would be getting like $35 an hour for me from the contract firm)] so when the contract firm found out I was on the market with two firm offers..they counter-offered!  They have NEVER hired a temp but my supervisor went out of her way to make me an offer to stay.

They offered me a fantasic salary ..OMG's...its more than the last place!! [average salary for a good secretary in OC starts around 45k]  And..no probation crap..and full medical/dental after 90 days (so roughly October 1 I can sign up).  They didn't have a problem with me going to Chicago for retreat [although you never tell your employer the exact definition of the 'retreat'].  The office has other firm locations in Los Angeles, Walnut Creek [yes..my friend...Walnut Creek], San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix.  I had NO idea that they were that big or had that many attorneys working for them.

The office is in Newport Beach [yep...I'm in the OC for sure..for sure] and its not very far from the last place or the other offices I've contracted for in the OC.  They have all been within a mile or two of each other so I know the area now like the back of my hand.  So..I said yes to the contract job and was hired on FT as of 6/22/06.  The girls all took me out to lunch this last Friday to welcome me...a great bunch of gals I must say :)  

I was on cloud 9 for the rest of last week!  I've worked so hard and been through so much this last year.  The move and losing Ru just about did me in and leaving the kids and the grandbabies was the second hardest thing I've had to do.  I was starting to think I'd never get a FT perm position with the salary I was asking.  So...I felt like a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders.  This job will give me enough [and some left over] to NOT have to work any other part time jobs (except for the time I volunteer to the House) for a long time!

And with that said.. I think I'm going to crawl into bed. My new hours are 8 to 5 which means I've got to be out the door no later than 7a to get to the office on time.

Hope everyone is doing well.  Be safe and take care of yourselves my friends ;)

So has anyone else just realized that we are in the winding down days before retreat aka the unraveling of the world as we know it ...or am I the only one?

Updating from my last entry.  

I did quit the job ...and then promptly took 10 days off and spent it with my aunt who came down from Alaska.  We are very close (she's only a year and a half older than me...she is my mother's younger sister) and she's been like a sister to me all these years.  We grew up living next door to each other (her mom was my grandmother).  

We took two days after Memorial weekend and went down to Tijuana and Rosarito Beach (Baja Mexico).  

My aunt has never been to Mexico and this trip was the first in 25 years that she's gone anywhere by herself.  She was overwhelmed by the poverty we saw in Tijuana.  She's seen it on TV but until you're standing right smack in the middle of it...you don't understand and you don't know.  

We went into Tijuana and went to the bus station to enquire about the bus to the beach.  I've never been there and she offered to pay so I had HELL YES...LETS GO!.  So we took the bus down the coast on the new Mexico toll road.  Rosarita Beach used to be a sleepy little village but its turning into (well the whole coast from Tijuana to Puerto Neuvo) one big effing resort.  Buildings are going up everywhere...new ones of concrete and plaster while the local folks are still living in huts (we saw buildings but they were just shells, no windows or doors) as we passed them all the way down to the resort.   

We were able to sweet talk the front desk dude into a very nice room overlooking the ocean for a nominal charge (the rates for the holiday weekend were up in the 300.00 range but we got a room for the night for 79.00).  We had a good time and we lounged on the beach and then ate in the restaurant for dinner.  After that we walked the main streets shopping at the sidewalk vendors.  I taught her how to barter with them :)  She's never done it before but she had fun.  She's never just got in the car or plane and gone anywhere without a plan or reservation!  I prefer to go that way ..I like being spontaneous :)

anyway...after the Mexico trip we came back and rested up and then took off for Phoenix to visit my uncle (her older brother) who I'd not seen in some time.  We stayed there for two days and it was nice to see my counsins and their kids.  The trip over was nice but really hot..it was up to 113 when we were crossing the desert and the whole weekend at my uncle's house was over 110 so we spent our free time in the back yard splashing in their pool.

After that we took off and headed back to CA. We did a few sidetrips to see some places she's not been too but got home late Tuesday evening.  We did some shopping for her last minute gifts to take home and I had a new contract job that I started on Thursday (6/8) so I got off early that day and was home in time to get her to the airport with time to spare.  She bawled like a baby and I told her to buck up..she could come back whenever she wanted.

So..I've been working the contract job for about a week now.  I've been interviewing in between and as of today..I've got three firms that are bartering with each other to outdo the other one.  I'm just sitting tight to see who is going to make the best offer.  I have one more interview tomorrow at lunch and then I can make a decision.  I did a interview today at lunch as an afterthought but I wasn't back from lunch 10 mins before that firm was on the phone with my agency asking me to come back to their office after work to talk ..as they wanted to make me an offer :)  I went over after work and talked with them.  I like them very much but its a smaller office and they do not have any group insurance which won't work for me ..I've got to have the insurance..so I told them my salary requirements (including the high end) and told him it would have to be enough to let me pay my own insurance each month.  He came back after a few minutes and made me a very generous offer...MORE than the last place that I just quit (I was working for the managing partner who turned out to be a effing jackass and I would not work for someone like that so I quit).  The firm I'm interviewing with tomorrow is offering almost $5,000 more a year to start and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they make me an offer.  I met with the junior attorneys and staff at the office there and I like them all.  I know they are only interviewing 3 folks for the job and I'm one of them.  

I'd like to ask for prayers please that I get the best job that is offered to me :)  

Other than that...not much else going on.  Buckling down to save money as retreat is just around the corner now.  I wasn't sure if I could go this year as I have no critter sitter and just starting a new position but it looks like its going to work out for me.

Hope your world is still intact :)  See you all in August!"

"event","I'm going to quit the new job :-(

Its been a month tomorrow and things are not getting any better or easier.  I've been putting in 110% every single day and its still not enough or good enough for the managing partner I'm working for.

I even told him about 2 weeks ago that he is tough man to work for and he intimidates a lot of people.  I think I stunned him as most people don't talk back to him.  He said ""You who worked on a crab boat....you're intimidated of me""?  I said yes...I am and its the way you come across to folks.  I also said that when I was crabbing...I was the boss and could tell people where to get off if I didn't like the way things were going down! but with you ...I can't tell you where to get off and keep my job.  I thought we had ironed things out but NOT. 

He's been thru 10 secretaries in less than two years...he drives them away with the way he treats folks and his unreasonable expectations (PERFECTION). While I'm damn good at what I do ..I am never going to meet his expectations I'm afraid.  Before I got there he had so much shit going on (scheduling meetings with doctors to discuss the case before they go to trial or arbitration) that he assigned things to be done by different staff but it was such a clusterfuck that no one knew what the other person was doing so everyone thought someone else was handling it.  I had to jump into the position with both feet running as well as treading water to stay afloat.  Its been an effing nightmare to try to figure out his calendar and wrap my head around everything that has been scheduled prior to me getting there.  We've missed a few appointments and that made my attorney look bad who immediately jumped my ass like it was my fault.  How the hell can that be my fault if I never made the appointment or knew it was or was not on the calendar?? When I tried to tell him that as he was chewing my ass out (and remember too I've had no training whatsoever...he just figured I should have known?? WTF??? He also barks orders at me like I was some kind of lower class citizen...I've had enough I'm afraid.

The rest of the office is a dream..I like everyone very much but the other secretaries and legal administrator walk around on egg shells to stay out of my attorney's way and NO ONE will work for him or do anything they don't have to ..they all HATE him. 

I got my first check two weeks ago and I admit its more money than I've made in a long time but I just can't get up every morning and go to a job that makes me physically sick (my stomach and IBS are on overdrive at the present time) and is such a negative place to work.  My other secretary friends all warned me to not take the job and even the agency that placed me told me upfront this guy was a doozy but I figured I had nothing to lose so I'd give it a shot.  I'm on probation 90 days before my insurance kicks in but I'm not going to hang around that long.  

Sometimes the money is not worth it.  I'm thinking seriously of getting out of law (as I'm so tired of having asshole attorneys for bosses) and make a jump back over to executive assistant etc.  I could be happy doing that perhaps?  sigh....I'm just very tired of having to go to work for a place that does not appreciate what you do for them and treats folks like shit.

I'm going to send an email to the lady who placed me at the job and let her know how I feel about things and try to smooth things out and not burn any legal bridges here :-(  

What would you do?"

"event","Since I had no one to spend it with this weekend I made sure that I sent flowers to both my mom and my daughter.  I was able to get them to deliver to my folks house out in Chugiak but the store in Homer would not and so I had to have the lady put some things aside and then Chandra had to go into the store and pick out her flowers.  

Both of them really liked the flowers.  It was a little spendy but it only comes once a year right?   So for myself I decided to do something nice as well.

I went out to Palm Springs yesterday afternoon and paid for one night at the Ramada Resort.  I was able to get checked in and still have 3 hours in the sun.  It was over a 100 (about 105 where I was) but OMG...I just so love that dry heat. So much different from Chicago in August.  

I then dressed up and drove myself over to the Spa Resort and Casino for my first Californian concert :)  It was outside with the mountains in the background and only about 2,000 or so people which is the smallest concert I've ever attended so the $50 for the ticket was well worth it.  After it started I got out of my seat and wandered down where the $100 seats where and got close enough to see them sing and see the expressions on their faces.  The concert was absolutely kick ass awesome!  The Wilson sisters still got it after all these years..... Damn...>Heart can still rock the house!<  I sang and danced my heart out!  

After it was over I walked the 3 blocks with a few hundred people to the parking lot and got back in my car and drove myself back to the motel.  I got a bite on the way back and munched it happily watching cable TV (I don't have it at the house currently) until I fell asleep.  I was up early today and was able to get in another 3 hours of 100+ sunbathing (well mostly pool floating today it was too nice to get out of the water!) and then I checked out and headed home.

On the way back I left Palm Springs and headed east to 86S where I cruzed by the Salton Sea Recreation Area.  Its nice out there ...but today I got the shit scared out of me as I was driving down the highway when the car shook and made this funky noise and I thought something terrible was wrong with the car until I saw the fighter jet go winging over the highway and then shoot out into the desert and he was gone!  He was flying so low that he shook my car when he came over the highway!!  That's something I've never seen out there??

So then I jumped on the 78 and headed west over the chain of san diego mountains.  Its about a  2.5 hour run to get from the desert up thru the mountain pass over to the backside of the I-15 North/South freeway but its got some breathtaking views and its one of my favorite drives :)

So...this is another long week ..still trying to wrap my head around the new job.  My attorney is very high strund and high maintenance...with NO room for errors.   I'm not sure I'm going to have what it takes to do this job ..its very high stress and pressure working for this managing partner but I'll keep you all posted.

I've got a few days off over the Memorial holiday and the week after while my aunt is here visiting for two weeks :)

I hope all of the mothers out there had a great day and were able to spend it with your families :)

"event","Still trying to hang on at the new job.  I love the work but my attorney is such an asshole!  He's only 7 years older than me and comes off as very intimidating.  He is the managing partner of the firm and its not what he says to you but how he says it you know what I mean?

This last week just drained me mentally.  It took all I had to get thru it. Everyone there says I'm doing a great job and I really like all the women that work there.  Only one is younger than 30 and the rest all get along which is rare in a law firm :P   If I can handle my attorney I could pull it off but I'm not counting any chickens until my 90 days probation is up.

I will move over the hills into Orange County if I make it that long ... or by the end of the summer either way I need to get out of the long commute or I will go postal!

So...as I was out this weekend driving around (yesterday I drove over to the CA/AZ border and splashed around in the Colorado River).  It was up in the high 90's there and I loved it. I just love getting in my car and driving off by myself. I love being in the car and seeing the road change around every corner and I especially love driving out thru the desert!  Today I took a shorter drive but it was so warm that I had to stop in one of the State campgrounds and work on my tan.

Its such a rush to just get in the car and drive anywhere I want to go...its such freedom for me and has really helped my mental health this past year.  Its been one whole year since I got here. Where the heck did the time go?  It seems like only a few months but its been a year.

Ok..so just got to get thru this week without quitting...so wish me luck :P 

Have a great week."

I've never seen it before and consider myself a good expert on movies that have anything to do with eygptian gods and anime all mixed together..but I was wrong.

Watched this movie with a friend last weekend.  I heard the synopsis and thought..well ok that sounds interesting I guess I want to watch it.

Wow...I'm going to have to get a copy for my personal library.  I gotta tell you...its not for the little ones.  I've never seen Yinepu, Bast or Heru every pictured like that ..phew...and the love scenes...I hate to confess but um I was a little more than interested..and I've not seen anything quite like that (the hawk/man and the blue woman/hybrid).  The way the movie went back and forth from real actors (I thought they were real actors..the man and the woman) and then CG people was incredible..are there any other movies out there like this one??   I thought the language they were speaking sounded like middle eyptian but I'm not the expert.  The scene of Yinepu and Bast playing Monopoly was hysterical!

So if you've seen this movie..what did you think of it?  If you are a real movie buff...explain it to me :)  Who the hell was John supposed to be?  For a while I thought he was Heru but that didn't pan out."

"event","Well....it does get better but today started out awful!

I woke up early with a stomach ache and thought I might have to call in if it didn't stop acting up but it did so I got ready for work.  

I finished getting ready and was out the door.  I got into my car and started out of the complex.  I looked in my purse and could not find my wallet no. 1 (I have two separate wallets) with my state id, miscellaneous documents etc.  I came back and looked in the house..no wallet no.1 ..headed back out to the car and tore it apart...found it under the passenger seat (how it got there no clue).

Ok...so back into the car head out again...get to the street and reach into my purse for wallet no. 2 for the debit card so I can get gas...that has my driver license, debit card and all my important stuff in it....shit...its not there...second freak out of the morning...I start to panic...I have money in the bank, checks, credit cards...I see flashes in my  mind of everything I own and losing it all ...so I head back to the house...I search frantically in the house...then head back to the car..no wallet no. 2..by this time its like 7:40 (and I leave at 7:15a to get to work on time and fight traffic) ...I sit down on the bed and start to cry..and then yell from my bedroom ...hey you Akhu....I need help!  I go out and stand in front of my shrine and say ""Look I've been holding up my end of the bargain..I've been speaking your names, put your shrine in the living room for all to see and I've been giving you water every day....you guys owe me""  I need your help!  I explain the situation and then go back to searching frantically...about 5 mins later...I'm in tears sitting on the bed thinking how screwed I'm going to be and that I better call in and let them know what happened...(and you won't believe what happens next)

As I sit down on the bed and reach for my phone I feel the bed move and all of a sudden ...wallet no.2 is sitting on the bed next to me (and that is impossible because I got up out of the same bed - made it up before I left ..and there was NO wallet there).  I'm stunned to say the least..it takes me a minute or two to absorb what just happened here.  I get up and go out into the living room and thank my Akhu profusely :)

I head into work....I start getting calls on my cell phone for offers for employment (its been either feast or famine on the contract work lately) the agencies (3) tell me that they want to offer me a position..BUT...I tell them to put their money where their mouth is and make me an offer :)  I've been working a contract for only 4 days at this new place in Costa Mesa ...and I'm not sure what happened here..but they talked to me on Friday (after only 2 days) and said that they would like to have me possibly go temp to perm in the future..I say sure and forget about it.  Today I get called into the administrators office and she tells me that she got off the phone with one of my agencies..and they know that I've been offered a few other postions (feast or famine I tell you) and they want to make it worthwhile for me to stay on with a FT perm job!  OMG..I was stunned..so for the next half hour we negotiate my salary, benefits and time off.

My firm wanted me so bad that they came back with an offer for salary $8,000 a year above my asking price!!!! Can you believe it!!! As of tomorrow..I'm full time permanent..yes PERMANENT with a new job working for a firm that does medical malpractice.  I'm going to be head secretary for the managing partner (his name is first on the door) and they will train me with the stuff I need to know.  I get full medical/dental benefits after 90 days (come August 1 [New Year] I will be covered for my insurance.  It will only cost me $30 a month for my insurance and a copay.  I will get a raise and a COLA allowance in one year.  They made the deal so sweet I couldn't say NO.  I get time off for my aunt's visit next month (I'm taking her all over while she's here) and then I probably can have a week off for retreat (but not the 10 days I had wanted) so if I can go its going to be Aug 5 - Aug 9th (that workweek) but I won't know for a month or two until we get the calendaring caught up and my attorney can sit down and talk with me.  I like it a lot as the women I'm working with are all over 40 and mature..no back scratching...no sleepoing with the boss and that generally screw you attitude I've encountered in other offices where there is no TEAM..its all about the ""I"".

So...I'm like so excited I can't stand it.  I'm going to move out of Corona and find a place over in Orange County closer to the new job.  My lease is up here June 30th so I'm going to try and pull off a move before I go to retreat if not it will after I get back.

Tomorrow the office is buying breakfast and lunch for the whole office in view of it being ""Administrative Assistant Day"".  Excellent.

"event","Yep...its raining cats and dogs here today.   The big storm from the Pacific has pushed its way in.  I'm sitting in my temp gig looking out the window from the 11th floor.  My window faces southeast overlooking Irvine district and the Laguna Hills off to my left.  I can see the I-405 from my window and right now its just a crawl :-(  Its supposed to storm for a few days yet.  I can't really complain though...this last 10 months its only rained less than 5 times and it does help get rid of the smog and makes everything green again.

Haven't posted this last week due to work schedule.  This week (and last) I'm at a firm in Irvine contracted to do 'paralegal' work.  I'm helping two attorneys get ready to go to trial in a land use case.  I've never seen so many damn trial subpoena's in my life!  I must have sent out 35 or more this last week and I'm still trying to get a bunch of folks served this week! So I thought while I had a break I better post :)

This last weekend was spent playing catch up with chores around the house (well because it was rainy this last weekend as well).  I went over to Lowe's and bought a few flowers after I hit the dollar store (GODS...I love the dollar stores!!) to pick up a few planters.

I cleaned off my balcony and took boxes and packing material I had saved from my move over to a friend so she can reuse them and got all of the stuff I didn't want organized and down to the dumpster.  I then put up the table I had and moved all my flowers there :)  So ...now I've got 8 assorted planters full of panseys, marigolds, primrose, asters and impatients.  I bought two rose bushes from Walmart a few weeks ago and two small orchids that I've been nursing from babies.  I just love having flowers year round!  How cool is that??? I just need to get a small water fountian now so I can sit out there this summer on the hot nights and enjoy my flowers and water gurgling.  I also put up a small hummingbird feeder after I found out that we have them in our area.  Alaska (at least where I lived) does not have them and it wasn't until I was in the lower 48 back in the 90's that I saw my very first hummingbird..spectactular..so the bedroom window I'm leaving open as the State shrine faces the balcony and Netjer can see the flowers and the feeder :)

Other than that...will be out of town next week from Wednesday, April 12 thru Sunday, April 16.  My mom and two sisters are flying down from AK and this will be the first time we've ALL been anywhere together out of AK.  I'll check in after that.  Stay out of trouble and be good to yourselves ;)

Third day at the current contract job.  Its a dismal office (meaning that its all old wood and dark ...and very cheaply furnished)...I don't like it...the mood there is just too funky for me and the three young girls are not very friendly and I found out today from the temp ssecretary/unlicensed atty to be who showed up today (who has worked there before today)...that only one of the girls is a 'real' legal secretary ...WTF??? She found me in the bistro downstairs at lunch and was nice enough to sit down and talk with me (the other three girls don't even look my direction during the day) today.   This office needs a little well a whole effing lot of help.  It doesn't look like they have anything organized and nothing has been filed away and everywhere there are boxes and piles of documents..its a huge mess. I'm running around trying to keep my shit together on cases I don't have a clue about :PP  

I'm doing another interview in the very same building..on Friday for a firm that I'm interested in working for so keep me in your prayers that I get that one ...otherwise I'll work this one another week or so and then maybe take a day/two off and hang out with friends :) 

speaking of friends... there is one out there that I'd like to say happy 3 yr anniversary too.  You couldn't have a better friend..and good friends are a treasure in our lives :)  Happy ..Happy SBD to you!..and many more :)

Ok...enough ranting ..I need to go sit down and watch the two movies I have to take back tomorrow night...I get movie brain when I go to the movie stores..I can never get just ONE....no..its an evil plot I tell you :P   so...I've got to watch Zorro (2) and Mr. & Mrs. Smith (I already watched Harry Potter 4).

"event","Yes...that would be me :-(   My poor face swelled up so bad I look like Pig Woman (no disrespect meant to anyone for this remark).  I just got home from the 2nd trip to the Urgent Care today.  

My bridge is so infected that its probably going to abcess.  I went back in this morning but couldn't handle the 2 women that had 10 kids in tow (I kid you not) so I told the clinic I would come back later when it was not so crowded.  I came home and tried to sleep for a little while with an ice pack but that didn't do me any good.  I've not slept in 3 days now.  I've not eaten for that many days either as I can't handle any food or opening my mouth to chew so I'm drinking lots of fluids. I'm so exhausted but each time I take my pain pills and lay down it only lasts for about 2 hours and I'm wide awake in horrible pain :-(

so...the doctor took one look at my swollen face tonite and they gave me new meds as well as giving me a double dose of novacaine and lidocaine (which hurt like hell trying to stick that damn needle into my already throbbing and hurting gums) but after about a half hour it was enough of a relif that I could sit up without crying (yes its that bad ..and I'm feeling very wimpy right about now).  This is the only bad thing about being single..there is NO one to help you or get you tomato soup you know??

Anyway...I ended up spending $84 for each office visit (with the rest of the bill coming in the mail as the doctor/clinic all charge separate charges) and then $35 for the meds yesterday that didn't do squat and then tonite...$179.00 for the new antibiotics (that I've never used before) and the Norco (like Vicodin).  I damn well better be able to sleep tonite.  I have to sit up for 30 mins after I take the antiobiotics because they are so strong they can eat your stomach (great).  It took me a hour after the clinic visit to find a pharmacy that would fill my meds.  When I got there..they told me it would be about an hour as there were people ahead of me.  Well that pretty much put me over the end...I sat down in the vibrating chair (demo model) and started crying...the pharmacy folks asked the other folks if they would mind waiting a little extra time so they could fill my scripts (as I was in obvious distress) and everyone was nice enough to let me go first so I could get the flock out of there. 

Monday I will need to follow up with the dentist to see about doing a root canal in the bridge and see if they can set me up on a payment plan as its going to be so damn effing expensive.  Sigh...having no inusrance really sucks.

Ok...my 30 mins are up so I'm heading to bed.  Please Netjer...let me be able to sleep like 8 hours without waking up.

"event","I'm off work today home in bed with an ice pack to my right side of my face.

My damn bridge that is eons old ...decided to act up and get infected.  And OMG's...its a doozy.  The infection is all the way up into my roots and my face is swelled up and it hurts to blow my nose, touch my mouth or open or close it in any combination.

I was lucky enough to find a friend who had some good antiobiotics (not outdated) and they gave them to me to take so I can get the infection down.  The pain is another problem...it hurts so effing bad that I couldn't sleep more than an hour at a time last night without waking up crying...yeah it hurts like hell and will until the infection is under control.  I plan on trying to find a dentist next week and seeing if they will do a root canal (about $1200 worth) to try and save it but its something that I've needed to do for years but couldn't due to not enough money up front or no insurance :P  So now that I have a little money stashed I will cough up the dollars to get this taken care of the right way ASAP.

I went to work  yesterday for a contract job and ended up puking my guts out as I took one too many pain pills and that on top of not eating all day yesterday ...well my stomach didn't agree with me and took care of the problem on its own :-(

I called in sick today and got up long enough to run to the store, get some soft food, check my email and head back to bed with the ice pack.  Anyway...I'll be in bed most of the weekend so if you don't see me online you'll know why.

Hope you all have a good one and stay out of trouble.

I had to go into the ER and see the doctor.  The pain was so bad (and still is) that he gave me my own antiobiotics, pain meds and some clove oil (to just with a Qtip) to rub over the parts of my gums that hurt (which is everywhere).  The ER doctor said he had not seen an infection this bad in quite awile.  I ended up coughing up money for the visit as well as another bill from the ER doctor (they all bill separately down here) and the pharmacy and to show I'm not a total whiner...at least I had the money to pay for this visit instead of having to borrow it.  I'm having to take 2 vicodin every 3 hours for the pain.  The bottle says every 4-6 hours but each time I try to lay down about 3 hours later I'm awake with screaming bone/root pain from the bridge.  Shit....this can't be happening...just when good things were starting to happen and things coming by way..this crap falls .... sigh.....sorry just venting..as I'm up again long enough to take the meds and climb back into bed (this time I'll try a sleeping pill and see if that will let me sleep another hour or so).

Ok...I may post again later if I wake up and can't sleep.  I would go thru childbirth again (and for you that know me ..that's says an awful lot) instead of bone / root pain.  Its got to be the worse.  When I had the leg surgery from the bone infection back in 1987 I thought I would die and wanted to..the pain was so effing bad it left me crippled and in the hospital for a month afterwards recovering and then 9 months after that with the IV tubing hooked up to me every 4 hours.  So..I know what I mean when I say bone pain :PPP This is so not good.

Hope you all get some sleep yourselves.  

Senebty again."

So how's everyone doing?  Are you staying busy?  I'm glad that I've got the LJ's to read because I don't talk to some of you for eons it seems :)  I'm staying busy and after this weekend I'll be able to take some breathing time for me.  I've got the legal test this weekend and I'm praying that I pass the damn thing so I can get on with my life and do the things that I've been 'dying' to do!

I spent the afternoon at the local library studying as the bird was too loud here and I needed to concentrate.  I finished reading that huge mondo legal [boring] book last month so now I'm going thru the mock exams and practice tests and questions.  I also checked out 2 Andean music CD's and 2 old movies [Ben Hur and The Man who Shot Liberty Valence] to listen / watch this next week.

I'm also out of a job [see my Pcon post] as of the 20th of this month.  I can't blame them though.  They didn't have enough work to keep paying me and the last week I had to beg for stuff to do to keep me busy as my attorneys were not giving me anywork [one leaving this next week to start the new office in Shanghai and the other just came onboard as partner and has not started pumping out the work quiet yet] but both of them were very nice and I liked working for Clausen Miller.   I can use them for a reference and I learned lots in the in-house training I got last month when one of their trainers came up from the main office in Chicago.  So it was a good thing and I'm glad that I was working the last 6 weeks.  So I'm again pounding the streets and out there 'selling myself'.

Looking for cheap (and I mean cheap) mix and match pieces for basic dance outfit (for the dance we plan to do in August).  There are such beautiful and EXPENSIVE stuff out there...its like my bead obsession...it could become quite addictive!  oy veh

Last but not least -update on my medical/legal situation:
The attorneys have come to a settlement.  Even though its not something I really want ..I'm taking it as its the best offer I'm going to get it seems.  

I'm not going to get any big amount but it will be more than I had in my bank account.  So the short version of it all - the opposing insurance company does not want to pay for anything else (even though the orthopedic surgeon said its a must for the surgery or aggresive therapy otherwise my condition will only get worse ... and since there was minimal damage to my vehicle ($487.00)...they are paying me off with a small sum [to make me go away] and paying off all my medical bills I incurred (about 8k) as well as my attorney fees.  I'm grateful for that if nothing else as I didn't need anymore medical bills in collection.  I've got two more to pay off and I'm clean :)

Anyway...the medical problem still exits.  I will have to manage myself carefully now until I either get a FT job with insurance/benefits or try to find a doctor who will take me as long term patient that I can pay a minimal amount for services (maybe low income approach)and have him fill my meds once a month or so.  I will also still need surgery in the future as well as therapy of some sorts.  I may look into acupuncture and other alternative treatments when I get my money in the next few weeks.  

Ok..that pretty much covers everything I've been doing, want to do and will be doing in the near future so you should be good to go for the next month anyway right :)

Senebty!"

"event","Decided last minute to attend Pcon in San Jose this last weekend.  I had a great time but it was lots of work as well.  I worked half a day and then took off like a bat out of hell to rush home, grab my suitcase and feed critters, check the house once again and drive myself up to Ontario airport to catch my plane.  I flew on Southwest and was amazed to find out that they do NOT issue seat reservations.  You have to print off your boarding pass within 24 hours of departure and you are assigned either a A, B, or C pass which dictates when you board the plane.  I was lucky enough to get an A both flights so I was able to board quickly and choose a seat where I wanted on the plane.

I arrived Friday afternoon around 5:30p.  I was in time to have dinner and then do the first Weshem-Ib on the road.  This was so different from any of the prior ones I've attended at New Year.  It was very small (a total of 7 of us).  

I got to meet Iadet (hope I spelled it right) for the first time.  She was awesome!  Weshebut also attended as did Imakhu Sedjemes, Imakhu Neferu, Senut (she had not been ordained yet), myself and Hemet.   While I cannot discuss the specifics I can tell you that it was very intimate and we did get confirmation that they were ok with it.  So...now we know that we can indeed perform Weshem-Ib on the road.  We also watched while Lezlie (our Dhehuty girl) got her new name.  I will let her post the name and her nickname.  She was so cool and I'm looking forward to seeing her in the future when she comes down to the Los Angeles area.

We then finished the rite and parted for the evening.  After that came Senut's ordination (congrats to her!!! Nekhtet!!) and we waited for it to finish and then chatted for an hour or so after that and then hit the sack.

We slept in as much as we could as we knew that Saturday would be hectic.  I had taken lots of homework to do (as that was the only way that I and Imakhu Neferu could attend as we both were studying like fiends for our upcoming exams).  We stayed in the suite while Hemet and Imakhu Sedjemes went to the voodoo presentation (which was very well received but unfortunately, all of the African presentations had been scheduled for the same exact time...what a screw up on the part of the Pcon scheduling department).  Imakhu Senut went to visit her father who was in a local nursing home in the San Jose area.  After the presentation we all did lunch again and then went back up to the suite to straighten up and prepare for our open house that evening (7 to 11p).  It was a huge success.  We had standing room only for about an hour but folks came and went all evening.  Some came to talk to Hemet about her voodoo presentation (including a few of the Ifa priests from the other African group which was very cool) and others came to say hello again (friends from prior Pcon's) and others to talk specifically about Kemetic Orthodoxy and the House.  We found out later that a few of the Ifa group was going to come to our Osiris ritual on Sunday night as they too are big into honoring their ancestors :)  We also did an impromptu drumming session that 'pulled' folks into our suite to join the music jam!  We also got to meet Kristin (fresh from the last beginners group) and it was so nice to see a new face and put a name to her.  I really enjoyed meeting her and Lezlie but wish I had more time to sit down and chat with both of them ...but ... we were so busy.

I thought I had seen it all but got to tell you ...there is always something new to see 'giggles'.   Hemet gave a good description of the freak show aka Pcon ...a train wreck..you can't take your eyes off of it!!

We had a man wander in later that evening who was dressed in nothing but a flannel checker bathrobe.  He walked in and since I was working security I greeted him and introduced myself.  He proceeded to tell me that he was a Gardarian [sp] Wiccan (nudist...yes I said nudist).  He then asked me if he could be of service and opened his bathrobe for me to see that ..yes indeed he was quite naked under the robe.  OMG's....It took everything I had to not fall over and die laughing at that point but I managed to keep my composure and thank him very nicely but told him that we did not need his services but if we did we would be sure to let him know.  He then wandered over to the food table, ate a few items and wandered out of the suite (I know that Kai Imakhu Antybast would have chased him out of the suite with a big stick if he had been there but since it all women this year we took it in stride).  It was not until the evening was done that we all sat down and I told Hemet :)  I had whispered to Imakhu Sedjemes after the encounter and the two of were grinning all evening after that.  After chatting for another hour or so we all hit the sack.  

Sunday was hectic :)  We were up late due to sleeping in but our presentation was not until 11a (the panel discussion on the Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt).  It was not as full as we would have liked but there were a lot of 'woo woo' wiccan and fairy lectures/rites that same time and a lot of folks were still in bed due to partying long into the night on Saturday (our suite was right across the hall from the Absinthe suite on the 9th floor and folks came and went all weekend as they were serving booze).  It did go well though and we had enough time to clean up and have lunch and then head back up to the room to do another open house (3 to 6p).  This went well too.  More folks wandered in and we had a great time.  We then prepared for the Osiris ritual that evening.  We had so much stuff to take to the room that I went down to the bell hop desk and grabbed a luggage cart and we used that to take items back and forth which was a good idea.  We also made use of Weshebut and Lezlie as they came too :)

The rite was kick ass!! OMG's..it was probably one of the best that we had done and that is pretty amazing due to the small staff we had to do it with.  It was well received and two of the Ifa priests came that night too (Imakhu Senut and I ended up talking with them at length afterwards and got their business cards and were invited up to their temple in San Jose to attend their events which is very very cool but I'm still out on if or if not I'm really wanting to be 'possessed by an ancestor' as I realize FINALLY what that would entail for me :PP ..so I'm still thinking about things but I am interested in learning more that's for sure especially since we share so many things and the fact they are so much dedicated to their ancestors like we are).

We had folks attend that were invited to bring their drums, sistrums and music instruments as well as to dance.  Folks drummed so damn good!  The floor was full of dancers and as the music progressed along with the ritual I became aware of ancestor possessions that began to take place.  I'm not sure of all that came but Hemet said we had a few Native American ones too.  I met one of them.  The woman that was possessed was part native american but also was a member of Iunet's Asatru group (what a combination).  She had come to the open house on Saturday and was very nice.  The ancestor that came thru her was none other than Deer Woman!  Her daughter was also a member of the Asatru group (who reminded me so much of our own dear Ma'ai, i,e., her face, hair and gestures)who was also present at the rite.  She came up to Senut and I and asked us to check on her mother as she thought someone else was here with us.  When I came over I tapped the woman on the shoulder and when she turned to me the look in her eyes just ground me to a halt.  It was not scary but it was so doe like [yes a pun but very true] and the voice was so soft and sweet [which was not the voice of the woman whose body she was using].  I asked her if she was ok, and then when she said yes I welcomed her and thanked her for coming.  I went over and got cool water for her and put it in her hand and asked her to drink and then waited for Hemet to talk with her.  It was just so awesome.  Its hard to put into words what happens at the rites but for those of you who know us and have attended you know what I mean :)  We talked with the other participants and checked on those that were sitting down on the floor or chairs to make sure everyone was ok.  We got fab feedback on the rite.  Everyone really enjoyed it and the Ifa folks (the two priests, one man and one woman) were so delighted to have been invited.  We really liked them and I'm looking forward to seeing them again and checking out their upcoming rites in San Jose.  We finished up and headed back up to the room to regroup and then head down to the Asatru suite to join the wedding party for Nakht and Iunet.

When we got there...we stood out as we were still dressed in our whites and Hemet still had on her headdress.  We walked in and the folks grinned and said ""Egypt has arrived!""  We than sat down and waited for the huge horn (that was full of booze) to be passed around but before that happened we asked the head priestess of the HammerOak [hopefully I have this name right] to sing one of their bawdy songs.  She had all us in stitches!  It was hysterical!!  After she finished singing and the rest of the Asatru group arrived (they were finishing up their Siedh oracle) we began the toasting.  For those who do not know the custom...they keep passing the horn around to everyone in the room and each person takes the horn ..makes a toast to the bride and groom and then takes a drink and passes it to the next person...but they keep doing this until they run out of booze!  Whew..... We only stayed for the first horn as all of us had early departures but it was good to show up as Nakht and Iunet's KO family.  The booze in the horn was their special blend of raspberry mead and everyone and I mean EVERYONE loved it!! The toasts were a variety of mushy to bawdy but it was so much fun and the Asatru group welcomed us all with open hearts and arms.  It really was quite nice :)

So then we headed back up to the suite and chatted for a hour or so and finished packing.  I had to be at the airport at 5:30a as my flight left for Ontario at 6:35p and I was planning on going into the office as I had to work that day.   I got to sleep around 2:30a and was up and out the door by 5:15a.  My flight was not full and I was able to stretch out on the seats and snore until we landed but we were a little late getting in so I was late getting to the office.  

I found out when I got there...that my contract was over as one of the new associates (not a full partner) had walked out on Friday with no notice.  So since there was not much work to begin with when they hired me and I helped them catch up on all their work I was let go yesterday :-(  It was kind of a shock but I knew that when I took the job it could or could not work out so ...I came home and was on the phone with the agencies right away.  I hope to have interviews by the end of the week and Dua Netjer I still have some unemployment available from Alaska so that should start up again in the next week or so (yep..I was quite busy on the phone yesterday ..I didn't waste any time bemoaning my fate).  

So today I went back into the old job and cleaned out my desk and turned in my parking garage key and said my goodbyes and dropped off my time card to the temp agency for payment.  Things will be ok ..I just have to have faith and remember to ask my Akhu for help with all of this.

Ok...my fingers are cramping up ..gotta run but wanted to share with all of you.  You were all there with us in our hearts and we missed everyone of you.  I'm so hoping to see you all at retreat in August.  Love you guys!

"event","I was going to stay  home today and study but ended up getting an offer I couldn't refuse.

One of my friends invited me down to Newport Beach to hang out with her sister's family.  They live in one of the gated communities on Newport Harbor.  The community is located adjacent to the Balboa Bay Yacht Club.  The club was one of John Wayne's favorite hang-outs and its decorated with many pictures of him and his movies.  I had the opportunity to have a light dinner there last year with my friend and afterwards we walked the pier checking out the million dollar yachts that are moored there.  I've never seen such luxury in my life and I loved being invited on board to look at the inside of the boats and talk to the owners.

This particular community is well known for its famous residents ..the newest being Nicholas Cage.  He moved in last July.  I was there for 4th of July and his house is right next to the public section of the beach on the harbor there.  We never did see him but we all knew he was home that evening.  For New Year Mr. Cage gave all the residents a very nice gift of smoked salmon along with a card that said Happy New Year from Nicholas Cage and [his wife's name here] and family.  I saw the card today and ate some of that salmon...very posh indeed ;)

As we were walking around the neighborhood checking out the houses we walked by Mr. Cage's house.  The house next door to his was once owned by John Wayne but after his death his family sold it off.  The new owner is rumored to be George Clooney.  The house in under major remodeling right now but once its completed its going to be awesome.  I can't wait to see if George really does move in there.

So as we were walking back to the house we saw this very elegant tricked out black corvette (convertible) coming towards us.  The roads are very narrow and we had to step aside so they could pass.  You can see exactly who's driving as you are close enough to reach out and touch them when they pass you by.  As it approached I could see it was a good looking man dressed in a black leather jacket with his hair spiked up.  He had an attractive Asian woman sitting next to him and as he approached us he gave a great big smile and nodded our way.  It was just myself, my friend and her niece standing there.

As he passed by us ..I about shit my pants...it was Nicholas Cage!! in person and right in front of me.  Wow!  While I admit to liking his movies..I really liked his earlier work as I feel the later movies he started to get a huge ego and was not as good as he could have been but still...hey a movie star..right there in front of me.  I just couldn't believe it.  It so like made my day you know??? 

After we got back to the house my friend's sister had to call all of her neighbors in the community and tell them the story..it was hysterical!  They had invited another couple and they showed up shortly thereafter.  The man was a radiologist [sp] and a gourmet cook and hunter.  He had prepared this succulent quail dish for us (well it was leftovers from their dinner party the night before but you'd never have known if he hadn't said anything) and it was absolutely delicious!  I've never eaten quail but it reminded me of spruce grouse like back home in Alaska.  For desert we had fondue chocolate everything!  We had poundcake, fruit, marshmallows and I even tried a gourmet potato chip covered in chocolate...simply out of this world.  What a wonderful day.  The family was so nice to be and I'm very blessed to have met them. They invited me back anytime I want to come so I'll take them up on that offer. 

I left around 6p after saying goodbye to all of them and my friend.  She was going to drop off one of the guests on her way home so she left a little while after me.  All in all....a simply fabulous day.  

Now for the rest of the week..its back to the grindstone and my nose in the books :P   I hope you all had a good weekend and have a great week all.

Senebty!"

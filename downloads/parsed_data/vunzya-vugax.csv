"event","So i'm finally here after flying around for 24 fucking hours! At least the airline had lots of sparkling wine and beer. Plus the airline attendants were very very nice. No attitude with asian airlines like you get with American airlines. 
 SO i'm really fucking tired right? Basically I cant sleep on a plane, so I didn't sleep for 36 hours. I get here and I'm starting to doze off...and then I hear some bitch screaming &quot;call the fucking police&quot; like 5 times and I thought i heard the sound of smacking around, but I'm not sure. Should I open the door to see whats going on? What if it's some murderer?? I didn't know how to call the police either...I mean is it 911 or what? I have no idea, and she keeps screaming, but finally i hear the sound of shuffling. The owner guy ran up the stairs  to see what the hell was going on. Basically they were really, i mean really fucking drunk, and I think he smacked her, I can't be sure, but they kept going on, and the owner is like &quot;I'm calling the police&quot; and she's like &quot;nooooo&quot;, and on and on..

 I fucking opened the door and glared at them. The asshole that hit her was back in the room which was diagonal across from mine. Then i saw who it was, it was the retard who was drunk earlier in the day, and introduced himself with a slur in his speech. My hunch told me he was an asshole, and I was right. Now he was throwing up in his room, and the owner was kicking his shit around from the hallway into the room. I walked over and looked into the room. I was so fucking mad! Here i was, soundly sleeping, and these two twats have to scream and be stupid.Now she was on top of the British asshole, slapping him. Plus that guy was so not tough, he has missing teeth i think, which is the british way. Anyway, i went back to my room, and he started acted tough to the owner. I fucking wanted to hit him over the head with the fucking stool in my room, but i didn't want to end up in jail ala brokedown palace. 
Then she ran outside, and he followwed her. They started screaming like right under my fucking window. Finally i had enough. &quot;WIll you shut the fuck up you asshole!&quot; i shouted from my balcony. he looked up with his wino eyes, and said he was gonna kill me. &quot;Bring it you asshole!&quot; FUck i was mad. I was gonna kill this scrawny fuck. He wandered out through the gate, and i went inside. Needless, i couldnt go back to sleep, and here I am 2;30 the next day, still fucking up, and still fucking tired. I think they got thrown out because I was all ready to kill him, but he's gone. Oh and there's 2 lizards on my ceiling!?? no, i'm not drunk...

this video is apropos- hahaha, remember this shit??

<P>he some guy that claims he traveled back into time, from like 2040, to get a computer that they need for the future. he basically stopped over, and answered some questions, then never was heard from again. i remember reading and being really depressed at that time, because the near future is not a&nbsp;pretty place, or so he says. but on the bright side, community is valued over everything else. hmm, well it IS interesting to read anyway. i always liked stuff about the future.</P>

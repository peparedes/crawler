"event","Well... as you can plainly see, it's been quite a while since I've written a journal entry. It's been a long while since I've written anything for myself actually. I just haven't had a reason to. I only write when I'm really feeling something, good or bad. Lately, it's been pretty neutral. Until now. Tonight I've made a discovery, and it's pretty much the worst feeling I've had in a long time. How can you explin the feelings that come with realizing you're being taken for granted by someone you truly care for? Truth is, you can't really. You can't express in words what it feels like to no longer bring joy to the ones you love, to feel like a failure as a friend. To put it vaguely, it's heartbreaking. So now, here I sit, comtemplating what all this was for, why this is happening, and what one can do to stop it. Frankly, there is no way to stop the inevitable. If the ones I love are separating from me, I have no choice to let them, to watch them let go from the love and friendship we shared. That's all for now, wanted to see if I could put this into words, and I guess in a way, I succeeded. Night."

And to put the icing on the already big enough it's falling over cake... Alex and I went in on a Season's Pass to Wonderland... woot...Peace"

"event","Hello All... Again, it's been a while since I've updated an yet not much has changed. Dilly had his birthday, I say it was a success because he was happy... wee! lol Umm yes, what else... well only 10 days left til the Evanescence concert, and I'm so excited! It will be ever so much fun. Today is a slow day because I neglected to go into work, where I could be making money... but I'm a dork, so I stayed here. Whoopie! Hmm... what else... uhh... my family is coming in a little over two weeks... my WHOLE family... like everyone, and some people who I haven't seen in forever, which should be interesting, but more awkward than anything. Eek! Well that's all I can think of right now... Wait... BB5 has started, it's gonna be one interesting season! WOOT! Okay... now I'm done... Later XoX"

"event","Wow... I'm behind in this journal writing biznazz... I actually forgot I had it... Whoopsies! But I'm adequately bored so I can write in it right now... which I am... Duh! Umm let's see... Tomorrow is the last day of school! YAY! Finally... I'm out... although I'm gonna miss grade 10... for some reason. There we some fun times, I'm sure all my peeps will agree. But this summer is going to rock my socks to the max. As long as it's as good as last summer - excluding the 'ugliness' I like to call Curtis - Then it will be bitchin'! Umm... Yeah, so far this sounds like something someone woul write in a yearbook, I guess I've been signing too many that I forgot how to write a journal. I'll try to improve. Okay, events... uhhhahahaha... I'm still infatuated with someone, probably wrongfully so, but I think things are looking up, I guess I'll find out in the summer (another reason I'm excited that it's almost here). Wow my life is so uneventful, it's sad! Oh... Timantha's (Dilly's) birthday is fast approaching, and I still need to think of the perfect gift. It will be the most wonderful fantabulous gift in the history of gift-giving! Well I'll let you know if I think of it... Lata Kiddos!! XoX"

"event","I'm so bored and tired right now, yet I'm on the computer still, refusing to give into sleepiness. Porquoi? Well bascially I need to talk to a certain someone, and they won't stop being away... how selfish of them. I've been on this computer all damn day and I have nothing better to do than continue with my nerdiness. Today... let's see... got up at 2, had breakfast, if you can call it breakfast at that hour, watched TLC, great shows they have... pshhh... moving on... ummm came on computer, talked to Timmy (Timantha), debated on whether or not to go see play again, decided not to, had a shower, more computer, had dinner, watched more tv, more computer... And here we are... What an eventful day I had. Well my Fasha is in Germany with my bro, so not much yelling going on lately, that's a good thing, but without that, it is kinda boring. I think I might actually go outside tomorrow... being a hermit crab isn't all that good for you, or so I've heard. Oh... I also did some writing today... at least I did something creative, if I han't I might of melted into one big blob of bored. But, thankfully, not talking to certain someone made me start thinking about certain someone, thus resulting in me writing about certain someone. I pity the person who actually reads this, they'll probably melt into one big blob of bored. Poor unfortunate soul. Well luckily, this is a journal, not some big website of stories where people must read them. I guess that kinda defeats the purpose of putting it on the internet if people don't read it, but for me this is was easier than keeping a hanwritten journal. Well I think I'm going to go to bed now, I'm giving in. My eyes won't even stay open anymore. Later XoX"

"event","I cannot even begin to explain what 'spramped' means at this point. There's so much shiat going on right now it's insane. First of all... Chef Boyardee should burn in hell for making me feel so sick. Now granted, I should know better as a teenager not to eat this crud, but when there's nothing else, you tend to overlook the hazards of such cuisine. Moving on... In other news, I've been so confused lately about a certain young lad, let's call him Gilbert Blythe ;), and where he and  I stand. As of present, we are good friends, nothing more, nothing less, but I can't help but wonder is there's something more underneath the surface. I try to coax it out of the young boy, but he seems to be occupied with other events, all for the best I suppose. It's probably not a good idea to bring this kind of thing up while he still lives too far away to make anything of...well... nothing, at the moment. I'm talking to Gilbert right now actually, and I quite enjoy being friends with him, but there's always going to be that part of that wonders if we could be something more than friends, again. Well that's the big issue of lately, and I don't think I have anything else to say on the matter, so I will digress. Ahem... new subject: I just returned from Timantha's (remember him?) play at school, and it was very nicely done. I enjoyed the music very much, but I am more than a little upset that poor Timantha didn't get a larger part. I know he will live up to his massive potential next time. I believe in you, you little spramp-hole you! :) There it is again, that nasty spramp word. It can basically mean anything and eveything under the sun, I guess it's up to the readers of this journal to decide what it means to them, when I use it more often. I will write again soon. Later Kiddos!"

"event","Hey, I'm new, out of boredom, me and my buddy, let's call him, Timantha, made a web journal dealie, whatever you call it. This is pretty lame, but I've heard it's fun... Timantha told me so, so I guess when I have an eventful day, I'll log onto this majigger, like a geeklet, and vent. Later Kiddos!"

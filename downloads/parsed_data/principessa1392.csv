"event","Hey, guess what? I couldn't decide what I wanted for Christmas. So, I decided I would ask for something I actually need. (That's a first... :D) I decided to ask for a laptop. I know that I already have one for school, but it gets taken away next year, and I will really need it for next year. 

    That's why I'm only asking for one thing, but it's something that I really need. 

All of the Christmas decorations that my family owns are put up. We already have one Christmas tree set up, but we're getting another one this weekend. Crazy!!!!!!!

Another good thing about this Wednesday is that we get off school early. But the bad thing about this particular wednesday is that it's picture day. If you read what I sadi before about the retake day, just forget about it. Because this time, I don't care what my picture looks like. I mean, it's not the last picture I'll ever take, right? 

Well, anyway. Lets be happy again! It's a wednesday!

Knowing me, I won't get a good retake either. Oh well. It's just a picture, right? WRONG!!! A picture of you is supposed to reflect who you are, and your personallity. Well, I guess that my personallity will have to be pretty looking tomorrow, or Im screwed... :o!!!

Oh well. And, I wont know what happens until we get the pics back. 

Wish me luck...

"event","Thanksgiving Vacation was pretty cool. You know, the usual stuff. All the weird relatives that you haven't seen in years come down, and sleep in your room, and you get stuck on the livingroom floor with your little sister. Fun!

But then, after the really great part (the above)then I went up to my grandparents to see all my cousin. I have five on my dad's side of the family, and we're all pretty close. My cousins and I are all within 8 months of eachother. We're all girls! 

At least we got snow and had no school. That part was pretty cool. Well, we got snow! THat was awesome. I love snow. Snow snow, I love snow! I'm absolutely, positively wild about snow! Can't go around it, gotta go through it! Beautiful, loveable, super-duper snow! I like snow... :D

Another cool part about the break was Harry Potter 4. It was really good except for the fact that they didn't even film the quidditch world cup!!! I got over it after the 3rd time of watching the movie, though!

Oh well. I guess over all, that I had a pretty good Thanksgiving Vacation. How about you?"

I am sooo unbeleiveably happy that we have no school for an entire week! YES YEs YES!!! I am sooo excited!!!

"event","OMG! I am soooooo nervous. You would not believe. Okay, so maybe you would. But this is my first level 2 assesment this year. It's in science, and it's on minerals. BOOORING!!!!!  That's what made it so hard to study. I hate minerals, yet i've had to study them EVERY night for the past 3 weeks. 

I am soooo nervous. I think im gonna fail it. Then, I'll have an even lower grade than i have now! I meen, a B isn't THAT bad, right? Cuz thats wat i have. 

I have the test next period and I don't think that I'm ready for it. I'm supposed to be reaading right now, so I can't very well study. O well. I'll just have to go by what little I now on the classification of minerals and ATTEMPT (key word: attempt) to get higher than a 2.5.

The principle says that it will help to break down the social walls in our school, that prevent evryone from being ""bestes buddies"". 

You no, it's a nice thought, but... NO THANKS! 

Lemme tell you one thing: I really don't think any one is gonna ""mix it up"" with the seating arrangements we have in the cafeteria today. Ya, thanks, but no thatnks, Mrs. Brandt!

You no, it makes me feel good when I get good grades, but to do that, you have to do homework. I mean, what's the deal with that, anyway?!?!?!? I mean, c'mon! I get like an hour of homework from each teacher every night. I hate HW & SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

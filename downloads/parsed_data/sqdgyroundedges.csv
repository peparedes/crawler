I realized why I haven't been able to sleep.
but I don't think knowing the cause is going to change anything about the fact. in actuality, it will probably make it worse. 

wow, I used to be into LJ. but I feel really sheepish about it now. 

anyway- my head is swimming. there are all these things I want to think about and then all these other things I really don't want to think about and they're all sort of up there squirming and they just can't get sorted. I wish I had control over it, like the ability to meditate. I bet that would help. but that takes some serious attention span and I just don't have it. so on goes the buzzing. 
I've never really felt like this. Except for one memorable night. but this has been going on for a week...at least.
I also feel really guilty most of the time. The guilt is totally eating at me. My stomach feels like a witch's cauldron, you know, all boiling and sizzling...I feel like I need some tums or something, but I'd still feel guilty. 

and I can't get that face out of my head. And I don't want to- because it makes me really happy. For a couple minutes there I felt like someone really liked me- completely didn't know me, but looked over and was completely willing to make me feel wanted and even maybe attractive. That felt nice, and it's the one thought that I wish I could hold on to, but that's fighting for attention too amongst all the other shit. and more guilt just piles up. Because I shouldn't being thinking about stuff like this. there are kids dying in darfur and I have this awesome life and all the material possessions I could possibly want and all the opportunities anyone could ask for, and I manage to find shit to complain about. what the fuck is wrong with me? I'm selfish and ridiculous and I am so completely ashamed of it. 


48 more days until graduation. 125 more days until orientation. 

oh, and the sun is back. Thank Buddha."

"event","This summer:
I went kayaking on a really big river and I got a sunburn on my knee and it's still discolored in that spot. 
I went to Rangely for the first time. Met Sean Fay. He is kind of the man.
Mike came and lived with us. 
I hung out with Emmalee...but not enough. We had some adventures. 
I stayed up all night with Allison (in my room OWOW) reading Harry Potter. But I never finished it. 
The day after that I went to Brown for three weeks.
I met my soul mates. 
I got married in Boston.
I had a love affair with Bubble Tea
I ate at Johnny Rockets at least fifteen times.
I stole a cup from the VDUB.
I ate pasta for dinner at least 20 times.
I watched about a million movies. Some better than others.
I fell (back) in love with 90s music.
I burned my hand making CupNoodles.
I became a Starbucks whore.
I learned how to dance in a hallway.
I brought out my inner child who became really good friends with Eliza's inner child.
I realized things about myself that I hadn't known before.
I had the greatest birthday ever.
I met some people I really didn't like.
I had to say good bye to some of the best friends I've ever had.
I came back and saw Allison first and we went to a playground.
I had a second birthday party. 
I went back to Rangely and I didn't see Sean Fay, but it was okay. 
I bought a book there and we watched the Breakfast Club, which reminds me of Liz and Eliza.
I went to a movie with my mom (more than once). 
I had my wisdom teeth out and ate a lot of Annies.
I rented a lot movies.
I did all of my summer homework within two weeks.
I read a lot.
I bought the second season of the oc. 
Lucy is going to France and I'm going to miss her a lot.

That's not all that I did this summer. 
This was the greatest summer of my life.
I'm going to Africa next summer, if everything works out and a civil war does not erupt in Malawi. 
I hope this year goes by quickly, but I always wish that. It never seems to when you look at each day but by June it seems like it has gone by fast.

Things to look forward to...or not:
SATs
college visits
April Vacation (in California)
being a Junior
swim team"

"event","Wow, I had a fantastic day today.  This morning during Skog's I got kicked out with Evin, and then we went over to Subway, it was good, I didn't have to listen to him babble the whole time.  Then I went to visit Devin but he was playing Everquest.  
Then I went around to my old schools and sold some stuff for fundraising...ya that's right, I'm a master salesmen."

"event","Well, I thought that the parade went ok on Saturday...for some reason, every year I do it it seems to get shorter and shorter.  Stupid Fortuna got first place, even though their band really sucks, they practice marching all year so they could be good.  I don't care though, I thought that we played better than them.

I went over to Botkin's last night for his party, it was pretty fun, we kinda just hung out for a while and then we went over to Sequoia Park, there were tons of mesquitos, but it was cool anyway. Then we went back to his house and watched Dr. Strangelove, that movies kinda weird.

This morning the Jazz Ensemble had to go down to OH's Townhouse over by Grocery Outlet...We had to play for some sort of a pancake breakfast thing.  They wanted us last year too so this was pretty cool.  I thought we played fairly well, it was pretty hard since we couldn't play very loud.  When we sat down to eat, they gave us pancakes ham and eggs, and WATER.  I don't know about you, but that sounds kind of like an OJ situation, water is just too plain for that meal.  I asked for OJ and the guy gave me a slice of and orange and told me to squeeze.  Unbelieveable...but it was fun anyway.

I've got tons of homework so I'll catch you on the flip side!"

"event","Well, today was an interesting one.  I arrived into math late only to find out that I failed another math test, I got a 44%, I'm definately going to have to look for a tutor so I don't have to take this stupid class again.  And that 44% officially puts me down to an exact 50% in the class, ya, I'm screwed.

In band since some stupid guy complained about the so called ""noise problem"" and told Mista Cax that we should march on campus, ya know, not like that would disrupt any of the classes in session, but then again, we wouldn't want to make it so the guy couldn't watch his soaps that were on TV.

After 5th period today I was kinda feeling like the day was a little too boring...so what can you do but SPICE IT UP a bit, and that's exactly what I did.  Shortly after exiting 5th period at my locker, some ""gangster"" pushed me against my locker...normally being the calm and controlled person that I am, I would just wave and ask how he was doing.  But, since I was really bored I decided to overexaggerate and start freaking out.  I jumped around flailing my arms and kicking the walls, hitting trash cans and such.  The guy just kinda looked back at me as if he thought I was crazy or something, I wonder why he would've thought that?

Sorry that I'm not really going in order, but I don't think it matters much considering this is only livejournal, not a timeline for history.  Anyway, I was really upset that devin didn't show up today in Jazz Ensemble because some individuals deserve to be laughed at.  I'm not trying to put anyone down or anything, but I'm sure that everybody reading this knows that anything Russ sees ""cool"" people doing, he thinks that he will be cool too if he copies what they do.  Russ earlier in the year or maybe still had/has a problem with wearing this black hat for performances...the funny thing was that I could've sworn I saw Sky and/or devin doing the exact same thing the concert before, coincedence?  Back to this morning, Devin has this very interesting shirt that he likes to wear to the concerts, even though Mr. Cox has specifically said SOLID colors.  This shirt is a kind of ""pastee"" shirt, orange colored. I don't what they're called but Alex told me about it.  When I walked in this morning and alex rushed toward me and pointed out that, suprisingly, Russ was wearing the same type of shirt, except a really nasty color and it wasn't as cool, it was kind of weird looking.  The point is anything that anybody cool does Russ wants to copy and does so because apparently, he isn't ""cool"" enough.  But I don't know where he would get that idea.  Don't get me wrong, Russ is a great guy, and he's a good player, he just needs to lay off the copy catting. No biggy.  I'm sure all of you are thinking, wow Shane, your such an asshole, but the thing is, I don't really give a shit.  Because there are some people that just irritate me sometimes and I plan on saying something about it.  The reason why I don't give a shit and say all these things is because it doesn't really matter anyway since there are a great number of people that hate me already...I don't really think this will fade them. *Smiley Face*"

"event","Damn Lord of the Flies, ugh, I am thoroughly and utterly disgusted by that book.  And damn Mr. Carroll's so called, ""abilities.""  He mentions them every 5 seconds, abilities my ass, he's such a dumbshit...but I like the class because it's so easy and his life is so ""hard and personal"" that we never have to do anything...hurray!!"

"event","I finally took my very last driving lesson...I actually had to sit in the car with this guy who was a total fruitcake, not that there's anything wrong with that, he just really didn't know anything about driving so I don't even see how he got his license.  But, unfortunately, I don't really get to pick who ""teaches"" me how to drive, so I'll just have to live with it.  When I was rollin' through Old Town in the driving school's car I almost hit this guy, his wife and their two kids because they ran out into the middle of the road, complete idiots.  I mean, of course it's not my place to judge, but you probably don't care much about your family if you run them out into the middle of the road, then again, that's just my opinion.
I had 2 hockey games over the weekend on Saturday...we did good, we won both games.  I actually have practice tonight in a bit.  Then this weekend I have another game, but I guess that I have to attend that damn Rhody Parade, so I won't be able to go.  Got kicked out of Skog's again today...and I'll leave you with that."

"event","Well, I have officially come back onto livejournal...basically what happened was i made about 2 entries then forgot my password, then I couldnt get it back for some odd reason.  With that aside, i finally got my drumset put together and tuned, thanks to my man Willie Clyde...he is quite the helper I have to say.  So since that happened I have some major practicing to do.  My ""shitting hi-hat stand"" really needs some work, but then again, i got what i paid for, it was only like 20 bucks.  Thats all for me, I have to go read the lamest book in the world(of course just my opinion, then again i havent really read any of it) lord of the flies and finish some good ole alg 2 hw. later"

"event","I went to the movies yesterday with a friend.  I thought that it was pretty funny, I sure like it.  I went to see Dodgeball, it was good.  Not the best, but it gave me something to do rather than just sitting around all day.  I guess that I was sitting down anyway but I got out of the house.  

Well, once again, I have no idea what I will do today.  I have to figure out something to do before I leave for NY.  I might go to the river, pretty good weather, go swimming or something."

"event","Looks like plans changed a bit.  Other than doing nothing at all, I guess that I will have to go bowling with a certain someone.  I sure hope that I have a good time, cuz I dont go bowling all that much.  I think that my highest score is about 60.  But I suppose that is good enough for a beginner.  Anyway, I have to get going so I can start bowling. Bye"

New York...
was great...and also a tearful event...
I didnt even get to GO to the city.
My aunt's back went out and she was blowing 
chunks practiclly the whole time.
I did get to shop.I did get kick ass clothes.
Which i love.Which i cant wait to wear.
And i DID hook up with a very cute 16 year old boy 
who was sadly a bad kisser and ended up a dissapointment...
But i wanted an adventure and i got one.
I met alot of amazing people...
I have a crazy aunt over there who grows pinapples ,yes, pinapples,
in her own back yard.Great huh?

Marching band started 2 days after i got back and has been an utter blast!
Today will be Moxie day when the upper classmen come and join us!YAY.
I've been marching my ass off...
and that's what hurts the most too.My ass.I find it hard to play,
do horn swings, and watch my stepping all at once though.
It's a challenge.But it's fun.

I went to my family reunion and hung out with my cousins...
I didnt ahe the best tmie in the world...we walked on the bay and caught crabs (which we later found out was illegal) and swam in the pool."

100 bucks is good enough for a few weeks of bordem.
I'm taking it to NY right after i buy cell minutes...
yes dahlings, i am out AGAIN.It's awful... as soon as i get them i seem to waste them so fast and poof! i have my aunt and uncle calling my cell and i get in trouble for not having minutes...AGAIN.i dont think i'll be telling anyone i have them though.Because i know if i do i'll use them.and wont have them when needed the most.The rest of my cash is strictly NY money.If i buy any more i'll be in HUGE trouble.They proabably wont even like me buying cell minutes.Oh well.Dont ask dont tell right??

Mike called my house today...
from Texas...
talk about a damper.
It was ok though...i told him i had ""things to do"" and i hung up.
I feel good though...forgetting about him and moving on...
to Chad.With the cute laugh.Chad with the beautiful smile.
Chad with the amazing eyes.Chad who i will be seeing this weekend.
Fabulous Chad.Who knows what will happen right?I'm a freshman in highschool...
and this summer has already been full of chanegs...
I'm so happy to think about them.

Last night my purchases were...

A pair of Square purple-ish sunglasses.
An adorable notbook with designs with old fashion wall paper print.
A new bag 
And a pair of lol YES WATER SOCKES for the river...i'm tierd of breaking flip-flops and hurting my feet on the rocks....what else can i do??I feel like a fish at that river...
i like to swim in it...
but never in a pool...
lets say that the YMCA...
with STRANGERS.YUCK.and embarassing."

I've always wanted to go! now is the time!I've never even been on a PLANE let alone the east coast...wish me well!!!!


Last weekend out at wynoochee i had 3 teenage boys knocking on my tent in the middle of the night trying to get me and my friend to leave with them...let's say NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
it ended with one of them driving by at 3 in the morning and throwing a waterbottle at my uncle....fabulous right?HAHA.


I've actually been talking to my cousin jake who is going to be a sophmore and we are totally opposites on the social ladder....it's odd and new...but he's cooler then i expected.
Actually becomming a good FRIEND.*gasp* that hasn;t happend seince we were like 5.

New boy with a shy smile has been looking my way...all i know is he helps his mom with her scoliosis(sp?) and his little baby cousin that moved in with him...and he helps in the kitchen out at wynoochee and is 15...has a permit...and already owns a car.His name is Chad.At least i'm liking someone in my age group this time.GOOD FOR ME.

 I now know a cross-dresser.
Who wants me to go shopping with him.
No one else knows he's a cross dresser.
I would have never known other-wise.
I thought the furthest this man got was wearing woman's
panties.I guess I was wrong.I thought it was neato at first.
Knowing a cross dresser.But things change...
I'm trying to be supportive, but all he now talks about 
is himself.Asking questions like...
How should I know what size of bra to get?
Where can I get fishnet stockings?
Where can I get leggings?
Would this go with my skirt?
Do they sell water bra's at Wal-Mart?

What do you say to a cross dresser that wont leave you alone?
Honestly, i'm happy to help...but knowing that THIS particular person
is a cross dresser....is akward.I guess I should feel blessed that 
he actually found me trust worthy enough to tell.


In other news...
 Mike left to TEXAS.teehee! no more having to bother with him.
No more having to turn my phone off....
No more dealing with my anger...
No more pressure.
YAY! I'm one VERY happy girl.

I found out the dot on top of an i is called a ""tittle""....
How cute is that???

I'm nearly finished with Rebel Angels...Good book.Better than 
a Great & Terrible Beauty...and very shocking to go along with.

The book signing for Twilight is on the 20th!!!! I REALLY want to go...
I have to go buy the book.And of course money for a t-shirt while i'm there...
I feel like i'll be meeting Ann Rice or something...Vampire queen...
Although no one can measure up to Ann."

Stayed up late last night reading 
Vampire Kisses.Good book.
I need to find the sequal Kissing Coffins.
Everything had been uber crazy.
My aunt is always mad.We got into this
huge fight.Yelling, Screamin, ended in Tears.
Wynoochee, was just hot mad miserable.I got sunburnt.
Went swimming in the river.And the pool.Inwhich,
Tony (creepy guy with toe fettish) kept on staring.
Which made me and Belinda uncomfortable, 
so we left.All i've been doing seince i got home was
babysit, and recive annoying phone calls from Michael."

"event",".The end of my miller experience has finally come.one word, WoW.
It has gone by so fast.Making friends and loosing them.Finding those who i can look up to, and realizing those who i cant.It went by ever so fast.Just to think 4 years ago i moved into this house with my aunt and uncle .....in another 4 years all i would have wanted will come true.The end of high school.I'm writing this before highschool has even began.My life is taking motion, it truly is.

   .I'm going to be an aunt of a baby girl this October.Hali May MacMillan.I just hope i can be the cool aunt who will teach it things about fashion and movies,music,etc.And that this child wont grow up to be a snob like it's mother.The Abercromibie, Aropostale, Cheer-leading, Complaining, snobby mother. Let's hope ""the apple doesnt fall far from the tree"" really wont apply here.

  .Sonya, great friend, has been acting very distant and grumpy after her fight with her boyfriend at his church and comming out to me about being Bisexual.I didn't act like it was a big deal....i mean i love Sonya to death how did she want me to act?And the fight wither her bf?Trying to be supportive but she just get's mad....what do you do?
 

 .Is it bad to talk about past love?Because Mike has been bothering me....I just dont want to be bothered with the bullshit of his idiotic choices.Or me for not seeing the flaws at first.Love makes us blind.But who's to say it shouldn't? if we saw all of our lovers flaws there wouldnt be a thing called ""love"".We cant see all the flaws.We are only human.But by the time you do see them, they dont matter anymore do they?That person has your heart and there's nothing you can do.

"event","im really upset about the war in israel.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.gamla.org.il/images/1998/may/burn1.gif"" /><br /><br />this is wrong.<br /><br /><font size=""2"">""BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- Four Israeli troops were missing Saturday following an attack on one of its warships off the Lebanese coast just minutes after Hezbollah's leader said the militant group will take aim at the warships that ""attacked our civilians.<br /><br />
<p><strong>Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech broadcast Friday on Hezbollah television that Hezbollah was prepared for ""open war"" with Israel</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Minutes later, the Israeli warship was struck by what the Israel Defense Forces said was an unmanned aircraft packed with explosives, setting the ship ablaze and damaging its steering capability. </strong></p>
<p>The IDF reported there were no casualties. Hours later, the IDF said the ship was still on fire and was being towed back to Israel.</p>
<p>A nearby civilian foreign ship also was hit during the attack, but the Israeli military spokeswoman said she had no details. </p>
<p><strong>""You wanted an open war, you will have an open war,"" Nasrallah said. ""You don't know who you are fighting today. You are fighting the children of Mohammed, ali Hassan and Hussein. You chose the war to fight against people who believe in their pride.""</strong> (<a href=""javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/world/2006/07/14/hassan.nasarallah.speaks.affl','2006/07/21');""><font color=""#000099"">Watch Nasrallah say Hezbollah is ready for war -- 2:14</font></a>) ((FUCK YOU! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!))</p>
<p><strong>""We are ready for it -- war, war on every level,"" he said.</strong></p>
<p>It was unclear whether the speech, which was broadcast with audio only, was taped or live.</p>
<p><strong>Since the kidnapping on Wednesday of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah guerrillas</strong>, which Israel says sparked the ongoing offensive, Israel has blocked ports, closed the main international airport by destroying its runways and struck strategic points around Lebanon.</p>
<p>Lebanese officials are urging the United Nations and the United States to intervene to halt the Israeli attacks. (<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/14/mideast.diplomacy/index.html""><font color=""#000099"">Is diplomacy an option?</font></a>)</p>
<p>Since Wednesday, 63 Lebanese, including two soldiers, have been killed and 167 others have been wounded, according to Lebanon's internal security forces. (<a href=""javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/world/2006/07/14/robertson.war.zone.lebenon.cnn','2006/07/21');""><font color=""#000099"">Watch Lebanese try to cope with violence in Beirut -- 4:10</font></a>)</p>
<p>The IDF reported that at least <strong>four Israeli civilians and eight Israeli soldiers have been killed, and more than 100 others have been wounded.</strong> (<a href=""javascript:cnnVideo('play','/video/world/2006/07/14/hancocks.hunkered.down.cnn','2006/07/21');""><font color=""#000099"">Watch an Israeli family deal with life in harm's way -- 2:02</font></a>)</p>
<p>In his broadcast speech, Nasrallah also warned that if Israel took its offensive to Beirut that Hezbollah would exact retaliation on the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, about 30 miles from the Lebanese border.</p>
<p>""I will not tell you any more. If you hit the suburbs or Beirut, we will hit Haifa,"" he said. ""<strong>We are going to an open war</strong>, to Haifa and beyond Haifa.</p>
<p>""<strong>We will not be the only ones who will lose their children and houses</strong>,"" he added.</p>
<p>Israel on Thursday struck numerous targets in Beirut, including the international airport, as rockets from Lebanon landed in Haifa. Hezbollah denied firing those rockets.""<br />-CNN<br /><br />this is so so wrong.</p>

today my day consisted of:
-laying in my backyard
-oasis on my ipod
-smoking weed
-writing
-my hammock

i made a vow to myself, i'm not going to put so much energy into people who need to be fixed anymore. let them fix themselves, i'll be here for the good times. my loyalty will prove itself one day. 

also, i vowed to continue writing all through summer. i think my choice should be clear of what i want to do by the time i start school again.

"event","alright, so i KNOW ive been ranting a lot lately, but deal with it and find the comedy in it.

so, i thought i figured out the 3 worst to be.

1. DMV.
2. post office.
3. the airport.

that is until TODAY.

WE HAVE A NEW WINNER.

1. MOTHER FUCKING TRAFFIC COURT.
2. DMV.
3. post office.
4. the airport.

i would rather sit in the DMV with a good book to keep me company for TWO DAYS STRAIGHT than to go back to traffic court again. i would rather tear off my finger nails. holy shit, its terrible.

excuse me if any of this sounds racist, its not meant to be. so, as im sitting there and MISSED MY FUCKING TURN because i had to go out to the car and grab my registration, this HUGE black lady is BUTT UP NEXT TO ME. practically laying on me because she is so obese. she feels the insesent need to talk to me with her breath that smelt like 4 day old cum and feet. we were told not to talk, so i just smile at her in hopes that she wont give me warts in my nostrils from her breath. the judge dismisses a guy who got a ticket 15 YEARS AGO, 15 YEARS AGO BUDDY, WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN? anyway, so he dismisses him and this lady turns to me and is all, (no joke) ""aww sugah, i hope he dismisses my case like that."" ok lady, of course we were all thinking and hoping that, BUT YOU FUCKING IDIOT, YOU WERE DRIVING WITH A SUSPENDED LICENSE, NO PLATES, NO INSURANCE, NO REGISTRATION, YOU WERE SPEEDING, ANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNND YOU WERE DRIVING A STOLEN CAR. cool. yeah lady, he's going to totally dismiss your case. this woman told me her life story, i swear. i could tell you what fucking blood type she is, what her parents names are, where she wants to be buried, and how she is cheating on her husband. im sorry, but it seems everywhere i go, fat black women always feel the need to talk to me. some of them are awesome, but OTHERS WHO DONT BRUSH THEIR TEETH AND WANT TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING need to know to back off. 

not only are you totally pissed your in traffic court, but your freaked out that your car is going to get stolen in the ghetto ass parking lot, you might get raped or mugged on your way out to the car (and im a small girl, i couldnt take them!), but seriously, when youre in traffic court, JUST DONT FUCKING TALK TO ANYBODY. NOBODY CARES WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. we want you to shut the fuck up so we can listen to some lame ass degeneret pleeing his ""sob story"" to the judge who obviously could give a shit. its like court tv. oh man.

so there ya go.
4 worst places to be.

now if you want my reasoning for the others, just ask.

do you agree?"

"event","im feeling a little sick, so that sucks.
karina fell asleep on my shoulder and now my shoulder is asleep, so that sucks/cute.
apparently there is a new cute guy at our school, but he might be gay, so thats funny.
i never wear makeup anymore, so thats awesome.
my parents are gone until february and i miss them, so thats cool/a bummer.
i am partying too much, so thats exhausting.
when i have a chance to sleep in, i sleep until at least 330, so thats gross.
typing this is really hard because i cant move my right arm or she'll wake up, so thats cool.
disneyland with karina, gza, marc, and arika was SO FUN, so that ruled.
i cant wait to see jenn this weekend, so YAY for that.
people have been leaving my life, so, that is kind of a bum out.

im really over typing, so see ya.

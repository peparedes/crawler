the door shut in my face.
it hurts.
i wish i could run away and forget.

Forever your eyes will hold the memory 
I saw your heart as it overtook me 
We tried so hard to understand and reason 
But in the one moment I gave my heart away 
The perfect breath where my mind lay beside me 
And all I knew is what had overtaken me 
With no explanation 
I am comforted by my inability to understand 
When I wake from this dream will you still be here? 
Will your smile still open my heart 
And leave me transparent?

Silence is golden especially in this case

Searching the skies and to my surprise

In each other's arms

""The Sound""

If I only had an ocean to compliment the sky
I'd pull it down and paint it for you and I'd never question why
Cause ""red would mean you loved me""
And ""blue would mean you cared""
But black my heart when left alone to cold and killing stairs
This is the burning of a dream
This is the burning of a dream

[Chorus]
The sound now turns to silence
But I'll keep spinning around
Naked in the rain of my own tears
As they fall into the bucket of your apologies
While closing everyone else's eyes
Because your own are shut
Not to see the volume rise again

Feels like I'm waiting in the last hiding place on earth
Haman's noose tight round my neck but im saved
and for 100,000 memories been washed ashore
Be swept again by forever
And sailed away from you

Now the rain has ended
So the sun can shine through me

[Chorus]
The sound now turns to silence
But I keep spinning around
Naked in the rain of my own tears
As they fall into the bucket of your apologies
While closing everyone else's eyes
Because your own are shut
Not to see the volume rise again

Only you could row my boat ashore
Only you could set my fears at rest
But until lack of sympathies regress
I'm still waiting...
I'm still waiting for your call

[Chorus]
The sound now turns to silence
But I keep spinning around
Naked in the rain of my own tears
As they fall into the bucket of your apologies
While closing everyone else's eyes
Because your own are shut
Not to see the volume rise again

it sounds like i'm singing inside a toilet bowl.
and the song sounds like what you put in the toilet before you flush.
the lyrics were lacking something.
its an ok song for our first one as a group, but we all have enough talent to do something more.
we decided to just do everything acoustic.
the electric guitars and drums failed us.
maybe cause we dont have a drummer. 
oh well, i am almost done w/the arrangement of a project called ""The 11th Hour""

streams of uncertainty filled the stale hollow air.
dead hearts beat as one as the wind scattered through her hair.
wheres the love she once knew?
when was lost everything thats true?
untraveled the tangles of her heart.
slowly tearing a calloused life apart.
its her time to be the best she can be forever.
but the quest is an endless endevor.
if seeing is believing.

I said my prayers, or so i said, and nothings hidden.
Lets sing a a song for only us,
cause no one else matters as much.
Lets sing it strong and sing it proud.
I dont know any better sound than that.


Drown with me tonight. Forget the world around you.
I'll sing to you softly 'til you drift to sleep.
this world could end tomorrow. Baby we dont need it.
The world will fall apart and listen, so will we.

Drown with me tonight. Forget the world around you.
I'll sing to you softly 'til you drift to sleep."

"event","I can hardly believe how fast the last two months have been. I'm really enjoying my job right now. The people I work with the office are great, and they are certainly keeping me busy lately. Last week i was up sampling Pyrrhotite Creek on Mount Washington (so beautiful). 

Had an amazing weekend. Well didnt start out amazing but it ended really well. I have been very frustrated as of lately with a certain roommate. I know we have differences and after threes years its unfortunate that the small things are starting to ruin our friendship. We've talked and I know things are going to get better, its just a matter of where to go right now. But fortunately I have amazing guy friends and they help to pick up my spirits this weekend and we all had a grand time at Jen's cabin in Lake Cowichan. Got to go sailing with Ryan and his dad on Sunday which was fabulous, I love, LOVE being out on the water, and they were both very impressed that I didnt panic when the rails almost went in the water. 

Back down to Victoria tonight to listen to the 3rd years in my program present their final projects and then working tomorrow in Victoria. 

Swiss and camp people in general, if you read this I love and miss you all, wish I could be there with you."

"event","I've reached the one month mark on my job here at the Ministry of Environment. The first few weeks started off very, very slow, and at first I was having serious after thoughts that maybe I had made a poor decision. However, some very valuable friends helped me to put everything back into perspective and realize what a great opportunity I had been given. I'm learning to take every day as it comes, learning to relax, and enjoy the slow times just as much as the hectic crazy times. 

As far as work goes I am in full swing with weekly checks of the ambient air monitoring stations in Victoria. It looks like I will be up in Port Alberni sometime in the next couple of weeks to set-up a new station at the mill there. As well I will be shadowing the audits of the Crofton Pulp Mill station. I have some on going work contacting pump installers, and excavators that deal with wells to educate them about amendements to the Water Act. In the aqua culture field I am contacting fish farm owners to track down production stage information for sampling dates for the past six years. And in the world I of Water Quality I have been quite busy as well, I have some ongoing data entry that I am currently working on building up a data base of phytoplankton and zooplankton species for lakes on Vancouver Island. Wednesday and Thursday of the this week I was up in Cumberland on the Trent River. I was working with Rosie ( a biologist here in the department), Stef ( a student from UBC who specializes in flourescent dye injection), and Jamie ( a civil engineer) to measure flow rates on the Trent River to help predict ideal times to purge the local sewage system to minimize algal growth (which is caused by increased phosphorous in the water). It was very interesting work but probably the most physically demanding work I have done in a very long time. We had to hike approximately 5 km up a fast flowing river in neoprene chestwaiters carrying 40lbs equipment and a full size car battery. We got finished at about 9:30pm on Wednesday night, camped at the top of the riverbank (after finally changing into dry clothes, I dont know if I was wet from the rain or sweating from the chest waiters). And then were up bright and early the next morning to pack all the equipment out again. On a side note I got to drive a big Ford F-250 through big mud pits and down tight gravel roads ( suprisingly rather enjoyable). Oh and did I mention that most of Thursday was spent in a sewage outfall, ya thats right. From this moment on I will always question the source of 'clear' flowing water, looks can be deceiving

Outside of work I really enjoying myself as well. I got to spend some time with Verity before she headed off for Toronto. Had a great visit with Shoshi and Destiny for two days when the stopped in to visit in Victoria. Have some day trips/camping trips planned to fill my weekends for the rest of the summer, including a trip down to Carnation in August to visit River Ranch. Lots of stuff going on for Tricia's Wedding as well, which will be great cause I havent had much of chance to see her recently. 

Well this entry has turned out to be much longer than I had originally intended so I will it here for now."

"event","So a lot has happened since I finished exams on the 26th. Let me fill everyone in. 

As of May 1st I am an employee with the Ministry of Environment working as an Air Quality Technician Co-op student. I have been learning about particulate samplers, COx, NOx, and Ozone monitors as well as temperature, wind speed and direction sensors. And the whole general MET tower set-up. 

I am now living in Duncan for the summer with my grandma. At the moment I am carpooling with family friends cause I am without a vehicle. However, that is all about to change cause I will be picking up my new car tomorrow!!

If you need to get a hold of me I still have the same cellphone number. And if you really want to entertain me, send me an email at work. Did I mention I have my own cubicle at work, can you imagine. So far the job has been less than thrilling but I am going to try and make the most of being in an office with such brilliant minds and try and help out where ever possible. Anyways leave me a comment with your email address and I will send you my new email address at work."

It would be a great job working for the Ministry of Water, Land and Air Projection in their Air Quality Division but it just leaves a lot of things to sort out in the next week, such as living arrangements and transportation but I guess I can worry about all that when I actually get the job. Other than that I have my chemistry exam tomorrow and then I am done. Boy will it ever feel good"

Had the most amazing Easter long weekend. Spent Friday to Sunday up in Ucluelet with my favorite guys in the world for Ryan's birthday. Went surfing for the first time, which was freaking amazing and I think might just be my new love... I want to go again so bad!!! It was definately a well deserved break before the stresses of exams. The only sad part was that Jenn couldnt make it up, she was definatley missed.

Hmmm what else, had a huge omg freak out moment with Jenn when we found out that Shosi might be coming to visit before camp!!! I just hope that I will be in Victoria when she comes. But that is all still dependent on whether or not I find a coop job which is completely up in the air at the moment. But I have been applying like crazy for jobs so fingers crossed I will hear something soon. Then I just have to find a place to live, maybe find a nice guy, and everything will be great.

Love you guys!!"

"event","So wow, its been awhile since I've updated this whole blog thing so here is the condensed version of whats been going on:

Christmas = Las Vegas/Grande Canyon with my parents, 21st Birthday, spent the entire two weeks sick, but had a great visit with mom and dad

Winter Semester = Only 6 courses hooray!!! Taking Chemistry, Urban and Regional Planning, Quantitative Ecology, BC Biodiverisity (Vascular Plants and Vertebrates), GIS, and an Intro Seminar to our 3rd year final projects

Free Time = volunteering one day a week with an education program for elementary school kids at Swan Lake Nature Sanctuary, Yoga classes two days a week, going to the gym with Jenn, homework, and attempting to train for the Times Colonist 10K

Living Situation = I couldnt ask for better roommates, honestly I love them both so much, they are my rocks and they definately keep me grounded, Jenn and Kailen I love you guys!!

I am so thankful to have such great friends in my life right now and i truly treasure every moment I get to spend with them. 

On the downside of things... My aunt has been diagonised with Breast Cancer since the summer. She underwent surgery back in September to have the lumps removed. Since Christmas the cancer has spread and she has been undergoing chemothearpy for the past two months. Friday night she was admitted to the hosipital with a high fever and uncontrolled body shivers and seizures. She is in the hosipital until further notice with a belived viral infection (not good considering her immune system is so low) However, she is an amazing, strong woman and we are all hoping for the best."

"event","First off, let me just say thanks for reading...

Now, if you have time, you might be interested in signing the petition below and sending a letter to our Heritage Minister Liza Frulla in the interest of fair representation in Canada's upcoming leader's debate as it is likely that, once again, the Green Party of Canada will be excluded from the opportunity to engage with voters via the party debates. 

The democratic institution, built on the foundation of equality, has been sadly abused by such decisions and thus, we become further alienated from the diverse perspectives that truly characterize our national identity. We DO have choices in this election, but we must not allow certain political parties to be privileged during the campaign. 

Whatever party you prefer, this is a non-partisan plea by me to ask that we all take action to increase the standards to which we hold the media accountable. All parties deserve a chance to speak.

"event","I have butterflies in my stomach right now. The strange thing is I dont think its from worrying about the exam I have to write in an hour and a half, in fact I know it isnt, bring on the aquatics exam, I'm ready for it. Instead I'm worrying about the holidays, which is strange, I love the holidays, its such a great time of year when you can be surrounded by the people that you love and care for. Yes I am really excited about seeing my parents over Christmas break, but I guess I am just sad that christmas is never going to be the way I remember it being as a little kid. No more decorating the tree with my parents, no more lazy christmas mornings opening presents and answering phone calls from friends and family. This isnt the first year we've forgone the traditional christmas routine, afterall grade 12 year we went to Costa Rica and it was one of the best Christmas because we all got the chance to just relax, year after that I was in the Canary Islands with the family I worked for in Finland away from my own family for the first time. Wow thinking back on it I feel spoilled and selfish for complaining now. Going away for christmas will be great and I am really looking forward to seeing mom and dad, I just miss that opportunity to go home and relax and just ""be"". But with mom and dad travelling for work a lot and not really having a 'home' anymore that just isnt a reality. I guess what I want more than anything right now is a hug, and that unconditional love that comes from being with family. 

Now I'm starting to cry in the computer lab at school, such a mess right now. 

Merry Christmas to all of you who read this. I wish you all the best!!"

<lj-cut text=""My weekend"">
Anyways...

Easter weekend was great!!! 

Thursday night Danielle, Jenn and I went out for martinis at Syn and then came back to my apartment, watched Dirty Dancing and then sat up talking and all fell asleep on the futon together. It was fabulous, we were all in need of a good girl's night. 

Friday was a pretty slack day. Slept in, had breakfast with Kailen at around noon, sat around talking and looking at video's, went and picked up Mischa from Pacific Sport, my god is that kid ever full of talent, met my driver at the ferry to give him money, then we (Kailen, Mischa and I) headed up island to Duncan. Went over to Ryan's for a fire with Zack, Kevin, Kailen and Danielle (different Danielle). Zack let me sleep at his house that night seeing as we dont have a guest room or extra bed or anything at my parent's house anymore and his parents were away. 

Saturday, everybody came over for french toast with strawberries and whip cream in the morning, the boys moved cars around in the Zack's yard, so that Kev could take his old car to the auto wreckers, sat and talked with Danielle and did laundry. Kailen drove me home to pick up mail and then to Chemainus to apply for a job at the sawmill again. Picked up some flowers and went for a short visit with my Nana. Kailen gave me my first standard driving lesson, which went suprising well, maybe one day i will actually be able to drive my own truck!!! though probably not, the driving part was good it was the whole I cant see a damn thing out of the mirrors that I'm still a bit nervous about. Went over to Ryan's for dinner with Kailen and Zack. Went back to Zack's watched T.V, which was weird cause I havent watched t.v in I dont know how long. Slept on Kailen's couch that night (Zack's house was too cold for me), got to share the couch with Chino (Kailen's cat, I forgot how much I missed sharing a bed with a cat!!)

Sunday, I was going to go back to Vic in the afternoon but somehow got convinced to stay for dinner and then take the bus back at 8. So I spent the morning studying for Ecology while Kailen and Mischa did stuff on the computer and tried to get there old nintendo to work (which it did in the end except that their mom got rid of their controllers) Went for another driving lesson. Kailen's mom somehow convinced me that it was a bad idea to be walking home from the bus by myself in the dark and that I should stay another night and go home in the morning. So we went over the Zack's to meet up with everybody, they all decided to go out to Jaime's for a hot tub, sat bundled up on the coach at Jaime's and listened to Kailen play guitar while everybody else went in the hot tub. Went back to Zack's and watched The Incredible's, I love that movie. 

Monday, had breakfast with Kailen's mom and then she drove me to the bus. Got back to Vic around 10. Decided to go home before going to Jenn's (she had invited me to go with her for Easter Brunch with her family). Got back to the apartment to find that our roof is leaking again and there was a huge puddle on Kailen's floor and all of his books were soaked. Missed Jenn's brunch, waited around for the landlord to come by, blow dried books, studied some more for ecology. 
</lj-cut>
A week with the apartment to myself should be kind of nice. I think I need the time to sort out my head. I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what I want to or rather should do about a lot of things.

Only 3 weeks of this semester left, and only 9 exams to look forward too!! Yay"

"event","Okay so I'm a complusive reader... well sometimes. I go from anything to your average run of the mill paperback  mystery novel, trashy romance (Nora Roberts is a definite guilty pleasure), to Steinbeck. 

So I thought I would make a list of some of the more intelligent books I have read recently that make you think just a little... 

<UL>
<I>A Short History of Progress</I> by Ronald Wright: Excellently written summary of the major fallings of the great civilizations in history and why we are possibly doomed to follow the same path. 

<I>Rape of the A.P.E</I> by Allan Sherman: A very funny look at the progression of sex in America society 

<I> O Rotten Gotham</I> by Tom Wolfe: Essay I had to read for my English 150 class interesting perspective and description of New York City or any urban city for the matter

<I> Clan of the Cave Bear</I> by Jean. M. Auel: Okay so I had to put this in because I am really loving the idealogy of evolution NOT being a forward process but simply a change towards a better suited species for the time. The idea of two tribes (species) of humans and who is to say that one is more advanced than the other. I'm still in the process of finishing the series but the next few books just seem to be about sex so I dont know, definately worth reading this one though

<I> Environmentalism is Dead</I> by Adam Werbach: Written by the former president of the Sierra Club on the changing nature of the environmentalism movement and how in order for it survive and really make a difference it needs to undergo a severe change
</UL>

Ok so these are some of my recommendations, what are yours? Pretty much I'll try anything once. Sadly the library was one of my favourite places to visit when I lived in Helsinki, the english section was very limited so basically I'd read anything that looked interesting"

"event","Ok so on a sad note, I had to put my dog Otis down yesterday. I dont think I've cried that much in a long time. It was a really hard thing to do but in the end it was for the best. She has been in a lot of pain in the last month, and the growth's on her stomach were starting to spread and ooze. It had gotten to the point where she was having trouble standing up on her own, and she fell down the stairs Friday night. She hadn't eaten anything in the past two days at all. I think Mike our housesiiter took it hardest, he had really gotten attached to her and just went through the same sort of thing last year with his own dog. Like I said probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, and even harder because my parents werent there for support. Thankfully, Kailen drove me back to Crofton so I could be there, at first I didnt think I wanted him to be there but I'm so glad he was, I really needed the support and the hugs.

Go out and watch it and I dare you not to fall in love with the two girls in the movie

What a relief... my god was today ever a long day. My Chem exam went well though which was a relief, two B+ and a A- so far, I can deal with that. Locked myself out of the apartment this afternoon, had to wait around until the apartment manager got home, haha it was funny because I had just had a dream about locking myself out last week. 

But now its holiday time!!! Flying to Prince George tomorrow morning to see mom and dad, then driving to Fernie for Christmas. 

Going to Irish Times tonight for a couple of drinks with people from school, should be fun. 

Merry Christmas to everyone, Best Wishes for the New Year!!!"

<lj-cut text=""Random 20 Lyrics (stolen from Brit's journal"">

Put you playlist on Random and write down random lyrics from the first 20 songs that come on, then see if your friends can guess what they are

1. She knows the world is just her stage 
    And so she'll never misbehave 
    She gives thanks for what they gave her 
    Man, they practically made her 
    Into a mmm

2. I got my poor old gray-haired daddy
    drivin' my limousine

3. Neurotic, psychotic and anxious has a dream about human language
    And finally find the words to say
    Easy easy

4. All you need is love is a lie cause 
    We had a love but we still said goodbye
    Now we're tired, battered fighters
    And it stings when it nobody's fault
    Cause there's nothing to blame
    At the drop of your name, it's only the air you took
    And the breath you left

5. Tell the tiny chemicals 
    the ones you hold responsible 
    they lost me 
    you lost me

6. You put the boom boom into my heart
    You send my soul sky high when your loving starts

7. Never judge a book by it's cover
    or who you gonna love by your lover
    Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise 
    She had the body of a Venus, Lord imagine my surprise

8.  A human being strives for something considered

9. Darlin' don't say a word 'cos I already heard 
   What your body's saying to mine 
   I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
   On my mind

10. Have a little love on a little honeymoon
      You got a little dish and you got a little spoon

11. She was praying (praying, praying, praying)
     And the words that she said (the words that she said),
     They still linger in my head (lingers in my head),
     She said, ""A child is born in this world,
     He needs protection,
     Got, guide and protect us,
     When we're wrong, please correct us.

12. Toora Loora Toora Loo-Rye Aye

13. I'm always assuming the worst
      But you're going on none the less
      And there's nothing to cushion your heart

14. Always tease tease tease
     Siempre - coqetiando y enganyando

15. How can we dance when our earth is turning

16. This week or last week
      I don't really care about it anymore

17. And often times we're lazy 
     It seems to stand in my way 
     Cause no one no not no one 
     Likes to be let down

18. Girls rock your boys

19. I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
     Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha 
     And take your picture

20. If I could fall
     Into the sky
     Do you think time
     Would pass me by
</lj-cut>

Tomorrow is studying for Biology with the girls and grocery shopping... oh my goodness do we ever need to go grocery shopping, seriously all we have is condiments left. Tuesday is study group for environmental seminar exam with ET people, Wednesday more studying for biology, and well the rest of the week I dont want to think about

Oh a happier note, I had a wonderfully Christmasy weekend. Saturday I went up island with Grant and Anita, spent the day at the Hebdon's decorating the tree and eating way to much food (great day despite being the fifth wheel). Sunday went Christmas shopping downtown, it was so much fun looking through all the stores and seeing all the christmas displays!"

more now than ever before.
So many thoughts floating by, 
but yet to grasp one seems near to 
Impossible.

I yearn to know what pain
feels like,
Yet keep a distance for fear of getting
Hurt.

But life doesnt work that way.
It keeps you in the dark when 
all you really need is the light.

Is this reason to run?

"event","Hmmm well... ya. No excuses for the lack of entries i just havent felt like it lately.

Went to a concert last weekend, which was awesome. It was with The Trews, The Waking Eyes, and Matt Mays and El Torpedo. I was actually quite surpised by how good the show was. I really enjoyed all the bands and am now in love with Matt Mays, he's like my new Jack Johnson... seriously I have problems but I just cant get over this fascination with guys and guitars, very attractive. Anyways, I went to the concert with Stacey and Adrienne and we ended up seeing Alyssa and Crystal in line which was really cool. I hadnt seen either of them in quite sometime. 

Monday and Tuesday were hellish... I had my Biology midterm Monday which I still dont know how I did on. I'm kind of worried I knew the material really well but some of the questions were worded differently and I think I might have mixed things up, that and I completely forgot the male and female anatomy of a plant, stamen ---> male!! not female.... oh well not much I can do now. Tuesday was my Chemistry midterm which went fairly well 87% I can live with that, although I'm kind of frustrated because I made some really stupid errors. 

Tuesday night I was completely exhaust. Midterms always do that to me. Anyways by like 5 o'clock i was in my pajamas and seriously considering going to bed when Adrienne called me. Jack Connelly and Shaun Verrault (from Wide Mouth Mason) were playing a free show down at Darcy's Pub. Which was another awesome show. 

Wednesday night ummmm... we were going to do stuff but ya ended up sitting around in Kailen's room looking at car stuff and talking. 

Thursday we headed home for laundry and big fires. Dropped Kailen off at his house and then met Erin, Caitlin and Ernie for coffee. It was nice to see Erin it had been a long time since I had seen her. Got to see her new place in Duncan. After that I went home to do laundry and play with my cat and dog. Well the otis wasnt there because Mike took her to work and the cat wasnt there either so that was a bit disappointing. I put in one load of laundry and was folding and putting away the stuff in the dryer when Bernadette came home and freaked out at me for no apparent reason. Which put me in a horrible mood, so i took my wet laundry and left. Yes I know its my house but she just makes me feel so uncomfortable. I dont even have a bed there anymore. Everytime I go back she has moved stuff around, which is fine, she move everything else in the house around all she wants but she doesnt seem to understand that my room was off limits, she has no reason to go in there at all. But of course I'm too nice to say anything. So anwyays I was really upset after that and drove back to Duncan and went to Kailen's. We were suppose to be getting together with Zack, Ryan, Kevin, and Caleb to have a big fire and blow stuff up (traditional Remembrance Day activities for them, somethings I just dont question) anyways, that never happened. We ended up making dinner at Ryan's, the guys played Underground 2 for awhile (the objection of there new found obsession), watched Team America: World Police because Ryan and Caleb had never seen it. We were going to go have a fire after that but Caleb wanted to go home and he was the only one with a vechile that could make it out to the hill, that and it was like 11.30 and I had class at 8.30 the next day. Went back to Kailen's to pick up laundry. Funny thing Kailen's dad trying to be helpful ended up washing Kailen's laundry twice, so we had to wait for that to dry. Didnt get back to Victoria til like 1.30am. 

Was so tired Thursday night when we got back that I completely forgot to set my alarm and slept through class on Friday. Ashley phoned me in the afternoon to let me know that English was cancelled in the afternoon so I didnt go to class at all.

Weekend was fairly uneventful nothing much to tell really."

"event","Handed in my Literary Review yesterday which was such a relief, I was having a major freak out about it, but I was quite pleased with it by the time I handed it in. So that put me in a good mood for the rest of the afternoon. Kailen got home shortly after I did, and we decided to both boycott homework for the night and go out instead...fun!! so we called a bunch of people and no one else wanted to go out... bad... shortly after this Stacey called me saying that she was coming down to Vic and did I want to go to 80's night with her and the hockey boys... now this could have been fun but they werent going out til 11:00 and I had 8.30 Biology class with much needed review for our midterm, so I turned down the offer and Kailen and I decided to go get groceries seeing as there was absolutely no food in the apartment and a movie instead. Having no fondness for anyone grocery store in particular we decided to try out the Safeway at Fort and Foul Bay... well we got there and they had no produce at all... strange very strange, so we went next door and rented Envy, Kailen didnt have his blockbuster card and they could pull up his account with out it, so I decided to open up my own seeing as I didnt have one, well anyways Doug the blockbuster employee was the most eager person I have ever met in my life, he was soooo excited about the membership process and he was really nice but I was trying soo hard not to laugh out loud and Kailen wasnt making it any better cause he kept making faces at me while I was waiting for my ""NEW MEMBERSHIP card!!!"" to be printed. Anyways, after that we went to Thrifty's for groceries, randomly ran into Kirsten and her friend Chris. Filled up on groceries, and a lot of bread for some reason... bad idea to go grocery shopping while extremely hungry. Well by the time we got home and made dinner it was too late to watch the movie because Kailen had to go to hockey at 11:00, so I watched an episode of Gilmore Girls I had downloaded and was just crawling into bed when I hear Kailen coming back in... which was odd because it was only like 11:30 and his game didnt start til 11:20. So I went into his room to ask what was up... turns out he got a speeding ticket *which he really cant afford right now* and couldnt find my car insurance when he got pulled over *I guess it might help to explain that he was driving my car at the time* so ya he was extremely pissed off about that just came home instead of going to hockey, so we both went to bed in not exactly the greatest moods... not always fun.

Anyways I not really sure there was a point to this entry just that I felt a need to write all that down."

"event","Hey I'm a girl too!! Really I swear I am... but for some reason no one seems to notice. I'm not saying that everyone thinks I'm a guy its just that well I dont know they treat me differently... I get that litte sister complex from guys. Which is nice to sometimes... but honestly is there no other way to attract a guy then slutting it up?"

"event","I dont know why I am so tired today. I could barely keep my eyes open in class this morning, and I was ready for a nap by the time they were done.  Pretty sad seeing as I only had class from 8.30-10.30 but ya anyways Danielle gave me a ride home which was nice cause it meant I didnt have to wait around for the bus and freeze my ass off... so cold out today. 

So hmmm... my first shift at work went well on Saturday. We were catering a sit down dinner for 200 people for a special olympics bowling tournament. It was actually quite enjoyable a bit confusing at times seeing as they were just training us as we went but there really isnt all that much to learn. 

Pretty uneventful weekend. Had to go home on Sunday to rack my mom's wine, had a nice visit with my neighbours across the street, was feeling pretty tipsy after a glass and half of wine. Went home did three loads of my own laundry and one of Kailen's, tried my best to avoid our house sitters seeing as they were fighting with each other again... its a very odd feeling to feel like a stranger in your own house.

This week is shaping up to be very busy. I have 5 page literary essay to write for Friday, Prelab work for tomorrow's Chem Lab then the write up for Thursday, review for the short story for english on wednesday, Biology prelab for wednesday, review for biology for the midterm for which I need to memorize the characteristics of the like a million phylums, I'm sure I'm forgetting stuff, oh and I have an oral presentation at 3.30 this afternoon on Compost, but I'm ready for that one."

"event","So yes. I finally got a livejournal *Thanks Scottie* I figured, why not? just another reason to procrastinate and well often there is a lot on my mind so this seemed as good as any a place to write it all down. 

Soooo.... my life recently.... pretty damn good... I'm loving school. Camosun is a great school, I really enjoy my program and the other people in it. I actually enjoy going to school and look forward to what we are working on... plus it is so nice to see an A grade on all your school work. I actually care again how I'm doing instead of at Uvic where I was just concerned as to whether or not I passed. I got a job, not much of one just two nights a week but its a start and about all I can manage right now. And well ya thats about all there is to tell for now. I dont know how frequently I will update... only time will tell...


Side note: I am a fan of the (...) right now, my english teacher isnt so keen on it however..."

"event","Well, last night I went to a friends house to spend time with them, and one of my other friends chick friends I guess has been asking about me for the past week or two so I was kinda feeling special last night. Well, me and her pretty much locked eyes for most of the night and it felt good to do that. I guess in the next week or two she needs my help to go get something from Home Depot and she wants me to pick her up and take her there to get what ever she needs. I don't mind at all because she one of my good friends now, and of course not to mention beautiful one at that. Anyway I dont know whats gonna happen that day, hopefully something good. Well at the end of the night last night she gave me a hug that I have never gotten before from any girl, it was long and it actually felt like she meant it instead of just giving a quick one and leaving. We talked for a while after that and all of the sudden I brushed a piece of hair that was in her face and told her that she felt soft. I guess she liked that cause she gave me a big old smile and another hug. In the middle of the hug my hand traveled down her back and to her hand, and to my surprise it stayed there for like 30 seconds till I had to go. I really hope this situation between me and her furthers and something happens between us but I AM NOT holding my breath and gonna take it slow if she does want something to happen soon. I don't know what else to say so I will keep the people that care about this on LJ informed, love ya all

I know some or most of my entries are goofy ones that dont really need to be commented on, but if i take the time to put it up, id like people to say something about them. Plus, some of you have my cell phone number and email address, you could once and a while see how im doing and in return ill ask how you are doing, if you dont know either the number or the email, ask me and ill give it too you. Sorry if i seem like this happens every few weeks with me but this sucks when nobody talks to me online or responds to my entries.

It was cool when he was playing White Wedding, a few times in the middle of that song and others he looked straight at me, that man can have an evil looking face sometimes, but in a good way, when he scouls its creepy and cool at the same time. I have no voice after tonight and i have to go to work at 4 tomorrow, which shouldnt be a problem but we will see. Like Justin said, if you could put a title on some people, some of them would be considered Gods. In my opinion, Billy Idol is now and forever will be at Godly status. The dude is in kick ass shape too, 6-pack at 50, LUCKY!!!!! Yes im rambling on but im so fucking hyped up right now after the show i dont know how im gonna sleep tonight. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HE FUCKING ROCKED, lol.

"event","Immaturity plays a big role in why im pissed at all of my younger friends now. Only 2-3 people online ever comment or say hi to me, and i have like 35-40 some friends on my list(s), im tired of all the drama in everyone elses lives and nobody giving a flying fuck about whats going on in mine, im tired of getting snapped at just because someones had a bad day or has a short fuse or just because its part of who they are, thats bullshit. Ive taken different types of abuse from my so-called friends for the past 5 years, not just one person, all of them have hurt me one way or another and i just think its time for me to get out of my defensive shell and start being an asshole back to the people that are being that way toward me. im tired of being talked down to by some of you like im a 5 year old when around other friends, fuckin a, im older than most of you and the way i see it now, more mature than you guys. im tired of being the moderator in little arguements like ive done in the past, no more, you know what, if i dont have any true friends anymore then thats just fine with me, ill go out and get another batch of people that are my age and more mature than a lot of you people. This has built up for the past few years and im finally letting it out to see the light of day. Everyone that i know needs to grow up and mature a little before talking to me again, ive done a complete 180 and feel that im the only mature one in this, though some of you will turn this around and say im not, oh well. im not doing stuff for anyone, anymore, not buying stuff for anyone, anymore, and not getting a thing in return. as far as im concerned 99.9%  of you guys can just leave me alone from now on and go back to your kiddy lives and let me be. i dont have anything else to say so yeah.....im tired of it and i just dont give a fuck anymore

Hmm, maybe I'll have to do some trips to see people sometime, I might come up to the school and see everyone thats still there that I know. Then, if shes working, I'll go up to the coffee shop and get one of my white chocolate mocharitas that Stephanie makes so damn well. Lol, ahh, the joys of depending on myself now are great. Anyhoo, I don't know what else to write right now so I will talk to you people later.

Im gonna downsize both of those lists if things dont change soon. Even if your on my friends list and arent a friend of mine yet cause you havent added me yet, it would be nice to hear from you guys.

He helped the Packers win Super Bowl XXXI, then my mom just came in about five minutes ago and told me that my grandpa has macular degeneration in his eyes, no cure, he will most likely go blind in the coming years. The day after Christmas sucks, im hurting for my family, and im hurting for the Packers and Reggie's family. Today won't be a good day i dont think.

"event","Ok, probably not gonna be anything but this is a strange situation right now. This chick at work, Cecily, who ive known since 9th grade on and off for about 2-3 years now who is beautiful as hell <----- i added that part cause she is, is having trouble with her so-called boyfriend Joe. She says shes not being treated the way she wants to be treated by him for the past few months, and ive noticed it too at work. They almost always have arguements in the middle of work and she ends up pissed/sad at him for the rest of the night. Tonight she said to me that he told her that she needed to lose 20 pounds cause shes starting to look fat, OMG, I wanted to hit him if he was there at that moment. She is NOT fat and looks damn good to me, and i told her that too her face when she told me what he said. It really pisses me off when he yells at her and calls her names when im in ear shot of this whole thing, it makes me mad to hear this cause she needs to be treated with more respect and love than shes getting from him. Im getting to the point to where if it gets too bad that i'll tell her that if she dumps him she can come to me to be treated nicely and lovingly instead of like a piece of crap all the time when hes around her. Shes too nice and sweet to be treated that way and i just wish she would open her eyes and dump the asshole already and possibly come to me. I dunno if thats gonna happen though. MAN the girl is beautiful and it would be really nice if me and her could go out so i can show her that she needs to drop the kid and go out with a REAL MAN like me, i have a tendency to treat girls really good, although sometimes too good to the point where im doing to much and they get i guess freaked out cause im doing stuff for them...anyhoo, i gotta go for now cause i cant think of anything else to say on this matter so i love you all and have a great rest of the night.

P.S. Anybody that works with me and sees this entry, DO NOT talk about it at work to anyone except for me if you happen to read it. I dont want Joe or Cecily hearing about this...theres only two people i know on LJ that i work with and you know who you are so please keep this under wraps."

I cant wait till new years eve when i go to my bosses house for a party shes probably gonna put on, hopefully my wittle stacy will be there so i can talk to her and possibly get her digits/number/way in/good times.....that kinda crap, heh, shes like 24-25 i think but thats not gonna stop me any, ive known the girl for a couple years now from seeing her at work cause she was a driver there so yeah and we get along just fine so i actually might have a chance with her if i dont act all stupid like i normally do, oh yeah did i mention shes freakin beautiful and has GREAT LEGS!!! This time at the party, if everyone sings kareokee <-----think i spelled that wrong.......im gonna sing with them and have even more fun than i did at my bosses birthday party.

hello livejournal. 

It's friday, and I probably won't get my insanely tacky contacts til monday. boohoo.

I love you, we need to hang out more.



2:51 AM.
yesterday I
got a buncha food
finally changed my clothes
got my meds
talked to natasha on the phone
saw my mom
brought chula home
cooked for chula
and never went to bed

good morning"

I don't have a man, so I wouldn't have one whos really all that important. I came this far without any male authority figures, which is why I turned out so WARPED. Think If I had male Guidance I may have developed into a different person all together. I just had my mom, and countless male suitors as a teenager which just made me dislike men in general so... Does that pretty much answer the question?

All I worry about is bitches, myself... and what i can do for these bitches.. how I can help these bitches, how to impress bitches, how to please bitches, what i can do to piss bitches off, expressing the way i feel to bitches..

I HAVE NEVER ever been rejected so many times in the past few years as in all my life...
 
Getting what I wanted never was this difficult.. so I must have changed my methods somehow and people are like no, no dice.




Um, as for broke people, we all get paid today so we will probably be spending our money foolishly on fast food and shit watch out. today and thursday

SSI checks in the bank so I'm thinking either a trip to IL today or tomorrow for cigs, Ive been so broke I bought tops and hav been rolling my own

i just sneezed, and some lung butter came up and it was salty

gross

well not really its a natural bodily function, sneezing, dunno what it means but yea that just happened

that was like 2 days ago, i brushed like 4 times that day
as opposed to just once yesterday in the morning
and once or twice this morning already so
I have to remember to do it at least one more time before bed



I am so miserable here, its cold, im out of smokes, i have no good food... i cant sleep very well because I have no bed and The couch isnt endlessly comfortable so i wake up and switch sides, broken half not broken half floor broken half floor not broken half wake up eat try to go back to sleep

its an endless cycle, it really sucks I really wish I hadnt moved out of my moms house

I have no car.
I have no job.

With my check I Was gunna pay my rent, my internet bill, and then possibly look into signing up for some classes at MATC to keeep me busy.. I Really dont know what to do and going back to school is starting to sound fun.

also i have to commit to buying that stupid couch and my cigs.. so its gunna be tough.

"event","true or not ur still and asshole for saying it.
if there was a way to get under YOUR&nbsp;skin every time and make YOU&nbsp;feel backed into aa corner and like shit
I&nbsp;WOULD&nbsp;DO&nbsp;IT back

or u get a phone call on christmas like, u know that one girl, the best thing that ever happened to you? yea her, she only liked you because she was attracted to me. not you.

true or not ur still an asshole for sayin it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i brushed my teeth
changed my shorts
changed my bedding
tried to cover up a disgusting mess i made all over the wall ( sorry its probably because im still half monkey )
the tree is up the day after xmas and probably will be for a minute
unless i help put away all the holiday boolshit early, which im completely willing to do its up to my mom to get off her duff
things cant be done quickly and efficiently, itsjust like taking ur hand putting it in a pile of shit and then smearing like ur in karate kid, wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off. never really getting it gone just moving the mess around
um, shit analogies probably not very nice to read but still.
i wish i had a matching pair of black socks, ive been getting them and then wearing em and washing em and i cant find any, i havent done laundry in forever my moms been helping me and shes nice enough to fold em and i just end up stuffing them in no order into my dresser drawrs, oh well, at least theyre out of sight and i know where i can find them.

i thought maybe, i would get a call soon but i guess not.
its almost 3 and i tried to straighten things
but 
i dunno

i took the garbage out all the recyclables that have been piling up

my mom just drives and buys shit and she makes everyone else clean her house and take out trash she makes too and then complains like its sooo hard to just drive my new mini van and buy things while ur at home cleaning up after my dogs and washing my dishes and taking out my garbage
l8ike buying shit is so hard? 
if anything thats fun
she gets to have all the fun
while everyone else does all the bitchwork

-pissed-

i guess if i would just get my GED&nbsp;and get a job and my own place things would be easier, im really gunna try to work on that idk how im gunna get all the way across the city to do it but id find a way maybe a bus pass or my therapist or my mom. 

i have one pair of glasses i cant get new ones for a year, i broke my first pair after a month, not even, and these ones got bent in my pocket already. after not even another month. 
i cant drive without glasses
so i hope nothing happens to them
because.
i cant take my drivers test til ive had my temps/permit for 6 months


-happy-

who doesnt like being rigid with discomfort and trying not to breathe too loud around people ur just getting to kno who are in ur personal space judging you. its just pure fun.

-shrug-

k 
downward spiral and go"

<b>CAVEDWELLERS.</b>
Me and Sara
Were so excited
About the
Moving floors
And the
Escalators.
We rode them
As many times
As mom would let us.
And my dad 
Told us
Not to act like
We were from
The woods.
It was 
One of those times
When I
Couldn't 
Suspect
Anything.


<b>2/20</b>

<b>HIVES.</b>
My hand moves
Up to brush
Hair out of
My face.
And on my
Forhead, there
Were a dozen
red, itchy
Bumps!
I didn't know
You weren't
Supposed to
Suck on the 
Mint herb
You get in your
Gelato.

<b>12 MILES TO THE GOLDEN GATE.</b>
From Fisherman's Wharf.
And when we
Explained our
Journey
To some 
British people
In the lobby
The declared
My mother
Was 
Abusive.

<b>SARA & MUM.</b>
When I'm with them
Suddenly
Everything
I say is stupid.
When I'm with them
Anything 
I say doesn't
Matter.
They make fun of
Everything.
It's like I
Don't belong.
When I'm with them
Sometimes I wish
I could just
Fly away.
I try to 
Hold back
The tears
As usual.
When I'm with them
Sometimes I wish
I could just fall asleep
Forever...

---No more poems were written throughout the rest of the trip. I am sorry for the inconvinience this may have caused you.---

<b>CALIFORNIA.</b>
Half the time
I lied about my 
Tears
Saying that
It was my
Contacts
Burning into
My eyes.
And the thing is,
They 
Bought
It.


It could have been better.</center>"

"event","<center><b>BUT IT'S NOT SO BAD, YOU'RE JUST THE BEST I EVER HAD.</b>
I remember when
I was at your house
And I remember saying 
That if he ever broke up with you
You should put that song
In your away message.
I never actually thought
It would come to that.

<b>SAVE MYSELF.</b>
Live your life,
Pay the price.
It's nice to know that
If I ever wanted
Attention
All I'd have to do it
Die.
And YOU'LL go on,
You'll go on
And YOU'LL lack the
Knowledge of
Who I ever was.

<b>HIDING TEARS BEHINED GLASS.</b>
I tighten up my mouth muscles. One hand slowly moves to brush some hair out of my face, the other is balled tightly into a knuckle-whitening fist. My eyes, they're closed, I won't let you see me. My lips slowly move, forming a forced frown upon my tensed face. The kind of frown you get when you're trying too hard not to-
I stare at my feet, I'm turning red. I twiddle my thumbs, force a few laughs. And then, without intention, I let one moist tear escape, making my black mascara run, and leaving a fresh, dampened drop on my sweatshirt sleeve. Soon, another follows and to my dispair, as well as displeasure, another after  that. And like rain,  they roll down my cheeks, escaping their entrapment from my eyelids. They leave a wet and salty taste on my face, and I turn away. Here I am, no purpose, no cause. Just taking up space. Worthless. And crying.



I think my mother hates me. </3 </center>"

"event","<center> Crying, dare I say, is a very interesting encounter. The feel of it, it can just never get old, you can never lose the excitment of crying. I know this is an unusual way to start off a journal entry but once I get more into it, it will all come together and you, mr/s reader, will understand.
Crying involves the jerking of ones inner body fluid because of an emotional event. Events such as these can be as little as scraping your knee while mountain biking with your great aunt martha, to as big as...well, there are countless possibilities. 
Today I went to my uncles wake. Lets just say it was the first time i've cried on front of my extended family. But the awful truth is, I felt guilty about it. Here's my reasoning: the person who had died, he was my great uncle. He wasnt like a grandpa or a dad. And I didnt really get to see him as much because he lived far away. But I still hold on to a thin thread of memorys from when I was little...The 4th of July parties every year..i looked forward to those more than Christmas. Also him bouncing me on his knee cuz he was a ""horse"". And when he was working at a pasta place and they were having a raffel, and he let me pick out the name. Those are the only memorys I have of him, but see his grandchildren had so much more and it just seemed that I shouldnt really be crying as much as I did because I didnt know him as well. I dont know, You tell me what you think, Im to weary to think right now.

Onto a different subject...this year as you all may know, there has been alot of changes in people and social groups and the like. Everyone is complaining that they miss last year and want everything to go back to how it was. What people dont realize is that if we keep clinging to the past, we'll basicly be living in the past. And see, everyone is talking behined each others backs about how everyone is changing. But see, its not there fault there changing. Its the people who talk behined there back, because once someone catches drift that someone has talked behined there back, the initial instinct is to change themselves thinking that by some string of hope people will stop talking about them. But they dont, they just talk more.
Im not mentioning any names, but I do notice changes in people and if you talk about it, its going to get worse. So please, if your one of those people, SHUT THE FUCK UP. Not meaning to be mean or anything but i just feel so bad for people thse days...
People are just trying to find out who they are, and if they change themselves, its not your problem. Let them be, who the hell cares? If you dont like them you dont like them. KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. 
...I'm sorry if anything I just said has offended anyone in any way but I just cant stand how people are acting right now. Its a damn good thing there are people like Sam and Snack <33333

I have nothing else to say; I am leaving you now.
<3Yours truly

The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;
It rains, and the wind is never weary;
The vine still clings to the moldering wall,
But at every gust, the dead leaves fall,
And the day is dark and dreary.

My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;
It rains, and the wind is never weary;
My thoughts still cling to the moldering past,
But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast
And the days are dark and dreary.

Be still, sad heart! And cease repining;
Behind dark clouds is the sun still shining;
Thy fate is the common fate of all,
Into each life some rain must fall,
Some days must be dark and dreary.

Held my own mom in my arms as she cries.
Thats not how people usually go about it.
But i guess there is a first time for everything.
Im gonna miss him.
Its so wierd, the sinking feeling.
The finalization of it all.
Knowing that you'll never see a person again.
Im gonna miss him.
I learned from a radio add that depression can run in the family.
^Right there is some hardcore evidence.
Damnit.
Excuse me while I go write some meaningless poems for the grim...

"event","<center> Seeing as there seems to be some kind of famine of sadness passing through our humble little town, I suppose today I'll just write about my thoughts on that...although they don't really matter as much as I would like them to but I guess thats ok because I keep this journal for my own pity's sake.
Last year in 6th grade when I had gone through my sadness stage, it was so dreadfully earlier than everyone else's which just happens to be this year. But see its just the fact that everyone is surviving through it together, all giving each other a boost over the hill. And it keeps me up at night knowing the fact that I never had a boost let alone a slight nudge. Last year when I was going through all my FUCKING SHIT the most people would do was just gossip about it, and talk about it behined my back. Talk about being kicked while your down. I know I probably sound horribly selfish right now judging the fact that I should be talking about other people's problems...but i dont know, it just kind of hurts inside knowing that I never had the pleasure of being offered a hand to hold in the darkest times.
Remembering all of the things that had happened last year makes me wanna...well I hate to say it but...die. Sometimes I find myself glued to the TV screen feeling the utmost jelousy for Mario in my brothers video games because he has the option to start over from a particular point in the game.
But even though I have said all of the above, I still feel very much sympathy for all you kids who aren't happy with their life and has now learned the hardway that life isn't all its perked up to be. I still feel so horribly bad for all those people who are suffering from sadness...or anything worse because NO ONE should have to go through it, no matter who you are.
I just wish mine would go away...
I really wish I could write more but unfortunatley its church time. I'm leaving you now.
<3Yours Truly

<P>The expression ""rain on your parade"" can have both a literal and a figurative meaning. The literal meaning of this phrase would be the fact that you were at a parade and it started to rain, therefore causing the parade to cancel. The figurative meaning of this phrase would go somewhere along the lines of getting your hopes up, and then when the time comes for such an event to happen, something happens causing it to either cancel or not being what you had expected it to be. For example, your parade may have been rained on when you began collecting golf balls because they were the ""in thing"" as one might call it, only to find out the next day the new fad was&nbsp; high tech calculators. Despite these examples, I'm sure when you think about it your parade has been rained on at least twice in the past. <BR>This new year, I suppose my parade was rained on, dare I say, poured. I'm not saying that I'm not happy that the new year has come, because I am deeply overjoyed to have survived another year. The thing is, however, nothing has changed. I had gotten my hopes up, just like I do every year, only to have them ""rained on"". But see now I feel selfish and arrogant for thinking...excuse me, hoping things were going to change. But, oh well alls the same, ends the same I suppose.<BR>On a brighter side, tomorrow I'm going to Snacks to see Napolean Dynomite because being the most random Snack and Mammoth on the planet, thats what we do. Oh, Snack, what would I do without you? hehe you menice.<BR>Oh well, I have nothing else to say, I am leaving you now.<BR>&lt;3Yours truly</P>

<CENTER>Well, the day before yesterday was christmas. I got alot of stuff including but not limited to a 14 karote gold (or however you spell it) bracelete, gift cards of all sorts, scarfs galore for some unknown reason, and an mp3 player. Yeah, I got an mp3 player. However I really wanted an ipod, a silver one. I dont know why my dad decided to get me an mp3 but whatever. It was a very passive event, a word which here means ""letting an event pass without much ado about it because there is nothing you can do about it."" Maybe you have expierienced a passive moment in the shoe store, when you sat in a chair as the shoe sales person forced your feet into a series of ugly and uncomfortably fitting shoes, when all the while you wanted a bright red pair with strange looking combination of laces and buckles the nobody on earth was going to buy for you. Or maybe your parents had enrolled you into the gardening club when all you wanted was to take boomerang lessons. I had just recently expierienced a passive moment myself sitting in a shoe store while the sales person forced my feet into a series of ugly and uncomfortably fitting shoes, when all the while&nbsp;i wanted a bright red pair with strange looking combination of laces and buckles the nobody on earth was going to buy for me. </CENTER>
<CENTER>Anyway, after opening presents me and my mom both sat down to a hearty breakfast of leftover chinese food, of which is our idea of the perfect christmas breakfast. And then for the rest of the day i practiced ""calligraphy"" which is an art or form of writing involving many loops and serifs. Nothing much has really happened so I guess I will have to go back furthur into the past.<BR>Oh yes, how could I forget about Larry's party. After school me caroline molly allie and kylie (sam and meghan&nbsp;were unable to attend to my displeasure)&nbsp;all got together and went outside to the pickup area only to find that mrs dore was already there and the guys (larry blake mike brandon and josh. Jack was no where to be found and brett was to come later for he had basketball) So mrs dore waited until my mom got to school, later than planned because she had just got out of work. We drove to larrys and all piled out. I said bye to my mom throwing my bag into the car so I wouldnt have to carry it home. Then we all filed inside and made our own sundaes which is always greatly amusing. I had a severe laugh attack as one might call it because Caroline so willingly reminded me of the time Christopher Basset wore limited too pants to school in the 5th grade. I was litteraly on the floor laughing and I had to hold my weight on the sink to keep from falling reluctantly over and over again. Then Blake informed us of the time Christopher Basset had painted his nails with his neighbor and I started laughing all over again. Yeah...ok so then we took a vote on who wanted to play either football or capture the flag. As you can imagine and to no suprise of mine, everyone wanted to play football including me. The teams were Me Allie Mike Blake and Josh&nbsp;against Molly, Caroline, Kylie,&nbsp;Larry&nbsp;and Brandon.Our team did pretty well none the less, even if Mike and Blake's ""Blue Lateral Strike Man"" ceased to work as many times as they executed it.&nbsp; Jack came somewhere along the middle and joined our team. Me and Blake had much to call each other during that game.&nbsp;Names of which included ""Catfish Molester and Hamster Doer"". Honestly Blake and I are the most mature people who have ever walked this infested earth. After football we all went in and watched a movie on Larry's SICK NASTY theater thing in his basement. We watched Christmas with the Griswolds or whatever its called. It was alright, but during the movie I was having a lot of fun with Caroline, haha funny times dude. In the middle of the movie Speranzella came and all was jolly. After the movie we hung out in the basement and then went upstairs to have pizza and cake. Everyone sang happy birthday to Larry and I looking at the fact that my birthday was only a few days before. Though it wasn't really my party so don't get the wrong idea. Then we all had a nice chat and me and Caroline threw cupcakes at each other because we are truly that cool. Then we went back downstairs and hung out and me and Blake ate Larrys swedish fish because thats what best friends do, take peoples candy. Then after much fun, it was time for me to ""blow the popstand"" and head on home for yet another party. I'm not going to get into that though seeing as though this entry is already very long and I doubt any of you have gotten this far. And if you have I will give you a cookie, prefferably a chocolate chip one because we have an abnormally large bucket of cookie dough in the fridge.</CENTER>

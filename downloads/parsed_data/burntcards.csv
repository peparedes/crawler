"event","Ohmygosh, i <strong>seriously</strong> go out with xaviera <em><font color=""#800080"">every single week</font></em>.<br />It's like a weekly thing already. ahahahaha.<br />Anyways, met her today at tm at like 11 plus plus? Goodness, her dad was super funny.<br />We went up to the cinema to get our tickets first. zomg, like half the timings are selling fast? -scary-<br />So then we wanted a later timing but the seats were like, not that good. We settled with 12 pm.<br />Teehee, so <font color=""#800080""><u>that girl </u></font>wanted to go to ntuc or fairprice to get her chips so we rushed all the way down.&nbsp;<br />Got her chips and rushed alll the way up again to get my popcorn. That darhling was so impressed that such a <em>biggggggg</em> cup of drink only cost $2.80. ahaha.&nbsp;<br /><br />The movie disappointed me greatly. The worse harry potter movie i've seen. -sigh-<br />I won't deny that some parts were done well, <strong>however however </strong>the movie moved so fast.&nbsp;<br />In the first part of the movie, it already went through like, 3 to 4 chapters of the book?<br />The whole entire thing wasn't elaborated enough and it didn't have the -omg, what's going to happen next?!- feeling to it. It was mostly predictable. So then, i'm wondering, is it the book content fault? or is it the new director's fault?&nbsp; And seriously, i think order of the phoniex was the most elaborated book in the whole entire series. Okay, i'm settling it with the director's fault. He didn't follow the previous movies at all.<br />There was this one scene sirius's head popping out from the fire? In order of the phoniex, the director made the faded image of sirius's face. It was like the fire was covering his face. Like there was a gap in between. <u>But </u>if you look at the goblet of the fire movie, sirius used the exact same method&nbsp; to talk to harry. HOWEVER, in goblet of fire, it seemed like the fire had a face shape. Its like two completely different things when the method is actually the same. Weird i guess.&nbsp;<br />When sirius died, that was the worst part. Come on, sirius was harry's last and closest kin. And when he died, harry showed so little emotion. I mean, not little, not elaborated enough. So yeah.&nbsp;<br /><br />DRACO MALFOY IS JUST HOT PLEASE. EFFING HOT.&nbsp;<br />xDDDDDDD. it was like, everytime he appeared, i just melted. ahahaha.&nbsp;<br />hot stuff lah.&nbsp; -i'm crazy over malfoy- But he appeared in so little scenes. -badbad-<br /><br />Okay, so after the movie, me and xaviera went around tm and cs to look for spongebob boxers. We found some, but they were freaking ex. So we headed to bugies street to look for the 2 for $15 boxers. OMG. All super cute:D&nbsp; We bought the exact same one.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/burntcards/pic/00009ac2/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/burntcards/pic/00009ac2/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Mhm, isn't it just so cute?&nbsp; teehee:D [spongebob is love!]<br />Oh wells, after that we went to bugis junction cause the weather was so freaking hot. <em>-global warming<br /></em>Had coffee at tcc. yummy yummy. goodness, xaviera has a weird way with words. Today at tcc, she said ""my battery no camera"" when actually, she wanted to say ""my camera no battery"" HAHAHA. funny stuff man.<br />Had this super funny conversation with her at tcc. Laughed like crazy.&nbsp;<br />I bought my chip and dale file today! I have so many at home. heeee:DD<br /><br />Yesterday was the syf celebration thingy. I so do not regret going. ohmygosh, darn fun!&nbsp;<br />The whole co was dancing, moving with each other. We had manymany laughs too.<br />:DDD took many many peektures. Sadly, myy cammy died halfway, so&nbsp; i have limited peektures. I'll upload the rest when jaclyn sends them to mee.

"event","<strike>Perfect</strike>, that's soooo&nbsp; the word to describe my life right now.&nbsp;<br />Maybe a part of my life is perfect, considering someone:D<br />The rest of it is just a jumbled mess to end with.&nbsp;<br /><br />Emotional. Some part of me just cannot take it anymore. I can't live with people like that.<br />Living in the past. Weren't you the one that told me we had to always look to the future?&nbsp;<br />Forget the past, live the present and plan the future? Wasn't that your ultimate goal in life?<br />i guess you're just being an jerk right now. Who said you could wait for me?<br />Who said you were worth it to give up someone? Who said you had the right to 'love' me?<br />It ends now, officially. All this crap has been divided from me, my world. You can live in your secluded world, where i 'loved' you. Cut yourself from the world, live in misery and a world coloured in back and white. You can't enter my life again, i won't let you. It was all just a mistake to begin with. But then you, yes you. If you continue to live in that world of yours, you'll never be able to see the world's colours and the magic it holds, its ever so beautiful majestic view. Last thing, dont come near me, or any of my precious ones.&nbsp;<br /><br />School is just plain irritating, its like, the holidays don't feel long enough and they give us endless homework. And now, they drag us back to school. This monday. -sigh- I attempted to do my math homework just now. I then realised how bad and horrible i was at math? Cause i couldn't do a single sum. I guess its time for tuition. I hate school so much. I mean, everyone does. But at least they're better than me. I can't do well in my studies for nuts. This end of year is going to be crazy. I better be promoted to sec four, if not, i'll just kill myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />I need this year to end, fast. I need to graduate from cca. Its driving me crazy. I cannot even play for god's sake, and now, i have to play in combines. Tell me, how much does that suck? A lot i know. And its not like i ain't putting in the effort. I am. But the thing is, how fast do you expect me to learn? It's not like i'm superwoman or something. -sigh- Maybe i should quit cca.<br /><br />Ilovehani, she's always so sweet. Always there for me, standing up for me. She always has countless advice for me. Whenever i'm feeling low, she'll always be there. From friends to someone to cca to studies and basically everything, she'll be there for me. I'll be there for you too hani! You'll my best girl for eternity:D<br />&lt;3333<br /><br />My jie! She's super uberrrrrr nice lah. Whenever i tell her some of my problems, she'll never fail to comfort me or give me advice. Although we dont communicate much, but i know she'll always be there for me. I'll be there for you too jie! love you!&nbsp; &lt;33<br /><br />I dont need to say anything about someone. Some people should know. Heh:D&nbsp;<br />love you darhling! &lt;33333<br /><br />"

Woke up and found out that nobody was home. I thought i was sleeping at some weird place. Oh wells. Kept the clothes then watched some tellly. Again, the telly and the computer always gets me stuck. So, i was late for church.<br /><br />Going into church was a total new experience and somewhat a weird scene. For me myself, not going for about 7 months? Woah, just suddenly appearing in church makes me feel weird. Sacrament was okay i guess, not many people went up to bear their testimony. What happened after the sacrament meeting was horrible. Bishop came to talk to me and sooooo many people wanted me to stay for the classes. I cant stay, i already know that what i'm learning in there, is not true. The history and all. How can they expect me to go for a class in which i dont believe what they;re teaching. Young woman is fine you know, its not history. Its just sunday school. And sunday school is before young woman, so i left. Grabbed some food before leaving. Hell, i was hungry.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Because you didnt tell them, because you werent truthful. I act like a puppet right in front of them. Dont you understand how hard it is for me? Yes we arent together no more, but hey, the feelings arent gone yet. Do you not know how hard it is to stand in front of you, talk to you, laugh with you and act like nothing's wrong? Do you not know how much my heart aches when i see you, with or without the other girl? Do you not understand what i feel for you? Did you not know how much i felt for you, gave you? She gave you up, broke up with you and so much more, and now you want me back? Why play with my feelings? I aint a toy, aint some doll you play with. The feelings you evoke in me are real. So real that when the feelings are broken, i feel hurt. I feel so much hurt you'll never understand. I gave you my heart, gave you so much more, only for you to play with. Not once, but twice. Maybe you forgot something, i <u><strong>did</strong></u> love you, and i <u><strong>still </strong></u>love you.</em>"

"event","Went to the national library with my girlfriends today(: itwassonotcrowdedatall. i swear. <br />So i got lost at bugis, smart eh? I kinda just forgot for that relatively short momet where starbucks was. HEH :/ <br />I met up with the two darhlings and proceeded to the national library. WOAH. the place is freaking huge. <br />There were no seats and we were practically walking around for half an hour till we decided to sit down, on the floor, in a corner of the library. <u>HOW COMFY EH. <br /></u><br />I did some studying, before jamin got bored and started snapping random shots. Obviousy i followed suit :D <br />Darhling fiona was so petrified by us, still, she let me take some realllly cute shots of her. I'll post them up soon. HAHAHAHA. <br /><br />We found our way to deli for lunch, somehow and fiona was complaining, about the pricing and the quality of the food. -sigh- But the food was realllly good! Its deli, what can i say? -skips off to wonderland- <br />Fiona aka Honey, had to leave right after lunch. T.T but then oh wells, she can't possibly defy her mom can she?<strong> HONEY, WE MISSED YOU AT THE FUN THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER YOU LEFT! ILOVEYOUVANLOADS!</strong>&nbsp; Don't worry, we'll catch the fun back like catching shooting stars(: <br /><br />After honey left, me and jamin dearest were left at the basement eating onigiri and walking around, shopping possibly. Here comes the funny part: jamin dropped some rice into her shirt. HAHAHAHAHA/. and she was frantically trying to get the rice out. OMG, super funny. We went to TCC after that(: <u><strong>TCC IS LOVE!</strong></u> hahahaha;<br /><br />Oh did i mention? i caught pirates on 25thmay, friday i think? Johnny depp is SO HOT. The movie was damn good i suppose and with a very, how do i put it, almost R21 scene? Ahh yes, sick. And the guys were like cheering them on, simply sick. But the movie was good on the overall. Damn, we didnt stay after the credits. I heard there was this 30 seconds scene. <strong><u>DAMN</u></strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><u>TODAY; 29thmay<br /><br /></u></strong>I was late for joseph's lesson by 20 minutes, and she let me off. <strong>NICE.</strong> The freaking bus broke down and i had to spend like a total of six bucks, to get to school for some f&amp;n lesson. Not irritating <u>at all</u>. Oh wells. Met jasmin after her library camp then bus-ed to tm. The place was so not&nbsp; crowded <u>at all</u>. Had long john's for lunch since it kinda depicted the pirates. heh(: I didnt' really like the food today; it was super oily. <strong>EWW.</strong> Let's see, we went to 77th street. I saw this reallyyy nice looking cap. 22.90. Someone buy it for me please? I'm cashless. Then went to a few other random shops. The one i realllyyy want to talk about, is toys 'R' us. You know, that super mega big toy store that we'll always drag our parents into and we'll goggle at the giraffe? Yes, that one. Me and jasmin darhling were like, deprived off childhood. AAHAHA. Seriously, we were amazed by everything. Eveery single thing. We laughed at so many things. No, correction, we laughed at <strong><u>EVERYTHING.</u></strong> I think, the baby's corner was damn funny for us. Jasmin was pointing to this spiderman on the floor and said "" Look! Spiderman;s crawling on the floor."" To our laughter i replied, ""NO! THAT'S FLOORMAN!"" And then&nbsp;we just stared at each other and laughed. Super hilarious. OH OH OH! We saw this Jack's sparrow's pirate stuff. Selling at 31.90, if i'm not wrong. Gosh, we were so tempted to buy it! Then we went on to those princess things you can buy. <strong><u>PURPLE WAS EVERYWHERE.</u></strong> Purple stands for royal. <u><strong>YAY(:</strong></u> Then on to barbie dolls. then, we finished our little adventure. That alone, took us 45 minutes. OMG. Hahahaha. I have a lil' conclusion. Me and jasmin, <u>have a lot in common</u>, from toys 'R' us.&nbsp;<br /><br />The shopping ended with cookies and coke. HAHAHA;&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>-jasmin dearest, i had such a fun time today! DE STRESS EH? hahahaha. let's do this something again. DE STRESS MAH. hahahahaha. oh wells, i hope you loved today. I did(: and oh, please comment about our day. iloveyoulorryloads!<br /><br /></em>"

"event","Probably no one will ever read this and that is okay....I have come to terms with many things in my life...I have friends and family that love me and that is all that matters...I am ready for that next step in my life but if it never comes I am okay with that...It means that is was never meant to happen in the first place...But if it happens it happens...Alot of things have happened lately but I will not discuss them here because there are certin ppl out there who will think they are funny and throw my weaknesses back in my face...but that is okay I know that I am the better person in the end so they can take their issuses and stuff them....

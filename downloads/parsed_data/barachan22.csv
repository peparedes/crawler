"event","How can people be so disgusting?? Yes to prop 8 to save the children and marriage? Are they serious? The divorce rate is 50%. Without nationwide gay marriage. And gay doesn't = predator. Why does it save children to pass a law that perpetuates sick stereotypes, paranoia and lies. Face it, people want prop 8 to pass because THEY hate gays, THEY fear gays, THEY&nbsp;are ignorant and are too evil to look past their fears and cling to one line in the Bible to justify why they can hate others but still believe they can go to Heaven.


VOTE&nbsp;NO&nbsp;ON&nbsp;PROP&nbsp;8 AND&nbsp;SAVE&nbsp;CHILDREN&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;HATE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;UPHOLD&nbsp;MARRIAGE&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;ALL!&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;Dear Mr. Rogers:

My affinity for all things you is no real secret. But there are a few things that have been bothering me about you. &nbsp;Its not your fault, I'm sure you didn't know any better. Please once I've addressed these issues take steps to rectify the situation and you will have my undying devotion forever.

1.) Stop spending time with Stuck-up bitch who uses you to further her non-career. &nbsp;I know she might seem pretty, and when you first moved out here I'm sure you thought she truly liked you. But since then, she only spends time with you when it gets her something and then treats you like her dirty little secret. Come on dude, your better than that whore. &nbsp;Think what your mom would say if she knew.

2.) Spend time with the getting to know the people around you better. You'll be happier.

3.) Wear mardigans more often, seriously dude, no matter what some people (they know who they are) think, you are one HOT&nbsp;BITCH when you slap on that black button up knit number. &nbsp;Consider investing in glasses. Seriously. Think of the children.


Thats my two cents. &nbsp;Please if you can't handle all three, pay extra special care to #1. I've been there man, I know how hard it'll be to let the image you have of her go and to make yourself see how she plays you, but in the end, your sense of self-worth will thank you.

Sincerely,

Bara"

"event","So it's officially been too long since my last post. I've graduated law school, moved out of Malibu, and am working at MGM. Trying to figure out how to have a career that has nothing to do with law. &nbsp;Not sure how to do it, but I'll get there. I have a guy I'm dating. He's really sweet, but lives a fair bit from me so I don't get to see him alot. &nbsp;And it doesn't help that my neighbor, Mr.&nbsp;Rogers, is totally fine and I'm in serious lust for him. &nbsp;But, I've never talked to him so....I'm just going to have to walk my roommates dog a lot. &nbsp;I mean walking is healthy right? :)"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#663366>&nbsp; Other than that, I am back in Malibu. Its cold as hell so I can't enjoy the beach like I want to.&nbsp; I'm doing the Nutrisystem diet to lose weight. So far its working, I've lost 3 lbs. in the first week.&nbsp; The only pain in the ass thing about it is you need to buy supplemental food to meet your daily caloric intake and still ahve enough of their food to last you the whole month. But, if all goes well, I'll get down to a healthy poundage in time to try to worm my way into audtions for parts in the Magnum, P.I. moive and Indiana Jones 4...maybe Smallville season 6 too, you never know.

<P><STRONG>&nbsp; <FONT color=#663366>On the law school front, I'm really getting into Special Education Law.&nbsp; I'm taking a class and a clinic which seems like it will be fun and I'll get to help some really cool kids.

"event","<P><FONT color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So its been a while since I did a serious update.&nbsp; I've not been feeling the greatest, the poor air quality in London is KILLING me. I've been sick more times in the past month than the whole of last year. I guess growing up in central Illinois and then being out in Malibu makes my body less tolerant to big city pollution. Barf.&nbsp; This means I'm behind on my work and I've got a month left to do it. I had my biannual panic attack last night as to whether or not I'll get everything done in time and up to my standards. I always do pull thru, but then I really need to stop doing this to myself and learn to pace myself better.&nbsp; All I can say is I'll do my best and thats good enough.&nbsp; I did, however, decide to take my IPL class as pass/fail.&nbsp; It just takes the edge off of things for now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp; All this said, it will probably take me until break to work on my fic again, which makes me sad.&nbsp; I also have an outline for a second story idea, but before I start it I need to think things thru a little more.&nbsp; Also, my Japanese classes are going good, and I feel the time I have over break will give me plenty of time to review for a placement exam.&nbsp; Which I need to rememebr to call or email the professor to set up the exam and get the proper paperwork and red tape to take a class at the undergrad campus.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also need to remember to email Judge Mihm to set up an interview in December.&nbsp; He's a federal court judge back home who has said he could give me a judicial internship next summer.&nbsp; It makes me, and especially my mother, happy because I can spend three months at home.&nbsp; Another person I need to check up with and set up interview with is the intership coordinator at SAG.&nbsp; I'm trying to get a clinical intership there for this spring. Soooo much to do. Sooo little time. But I shall over come. :) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents are going to visit with our family firends over Thanksgiving, which is exciting for me, since you know, I kinda miss the parental units. Sometimes.&nbsp; Sometimes they just get on my nerves. I also miss my friends from Illinois.&nbsp; But, strangely enough I just found out my firend Siobhan is engaged to a guy from my hometown high school's rival town. AND he's good friends with a guy I was in <EM>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat </EM>with, and he saw me in it and thought I did very well.&nbsp; This means she'll be around me over break.&nbsp; I should ask if she wants to drive back with me, but I think she'd rather go with her guy.&nbsp; It will be good to show someone from Cali my home in Illiniois.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I should head out now.&nbsp; I have to pay attention now. Boo.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp; So, even though I've been excessivly tired and taking way too long to get what I need to done, I've actually had a much better couple of days.&nbsp; </STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp; First of all, I got a new roomate and next door neighbor at the international dorm.&nbsp; Dinah, my roomate, is from Portugal and over here for three months doing research to wind up her Pharmacy degree. She's married, loves movies and theatre, prefers to hang out with friends at coffe houses or cafes instead of going and getting drunk and sweaty at dance clubs or discos, and is generally a wonderfully pleasant person to be around.</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp; Second, my new next door neighbor is hilarious and fun as well. Virgina (I'm not sure how to spell it) is from Spain and doesn't speak alot of English, so I'm not sure what she's here to study, but she's a lot of fun to be around and try to break down language barriers to talk to.</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both girls are GREAT to live with.&nbsp; They make sure to try to hang out together at least once a day, we try to make/eat dinner together as many times a week as possible. Though since they are from the Ibrian peninsula, they're used to waiting till around 10 or 11 to have dinner, whereas I'm more conditioned to eating between 5 and 8. Dinah has offered to take me home to Portgual with her when she goes back for a weekend visit at then end of the month. I am so gonna have to take her up on it, or try to see if I have the finds to do so, since I had a blast with her last night.&nbsp; A friend of mine from undergrad is in town and we were suppose to meet to go to the theatre, but I was a half hour late to meet him and I think he either left by the time I got there or he was never there to begin with.&nbsp; I think he might have passed out with jet lag, since he had just flown in that morning.&nbsp; Dinah and I decided to go to dinner and the play anyway and we had a lot of fun.&nbsp; We've even started to plan out which plays we want to see together while we're here. We went to see Howl's Moving Castle together the first night she stayed in the dorm, and had good fun. She's got LOADS of moives on her laptop to watch together in addtions to the ones I brought.</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; She asked to be able to meet my parents when they come to visit over Thanksgiving. I LOVE HER!!! After last year and the past few months of me living with people I am just NOT compatablie with I just want to giggle like I used to in undergrad. I lived with the same girl all four years, from the day they have you visit to see if you were interested in applying to the day we graduated. Meghan was like my sister and no matter how much we pissed each other off over the years we've still stayed close, even with her in Huston and me in Malibu now.&nbsp; Last year, my roomates and I just did NOT mesh well.&nbsp; Well, at least two of them and I didn't, they didn't really click with the fourth roomate but she opted not to stay in the apartment around them very often. The whole of last year was horribly uncomfortable. Then the first place I lived here in London over the summer involved too much drama, and though the girl from my school I stayed with when I first moved into the dorm was great, that only lasted a few weeks. The last girl I lived with was ok, untill the last for days she was in the room and she decided to pull a diva fit to rival the worst BNF tantrum anybody could even imagine.&nbsp; But she still wasn't someone I could have stood for more than a month or so.&nbsp; She partied several times a week, comming back late smelling of booze and cigarettes and kept the room FREEZING no matter how uncomfortable it made me. She let her friends smoke in our room (over my cloths since my stuff only fit by the window) and frequently trashed and/or left our kitchen disgusting.&nbsp; So needless to say things are a lot better.</STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp; Third, I've been sleeping better the last few days.&nbsp; For the past few weeks I haven't had the best of physical or mental health.&nbsp; I think I put on some of the weight I had lost and I felt tired all the time. I felt drained during the day and had to sleep most of the day, which kept me up most of the night.&nbsp; I'm not sure whether or not my hormones were taking a dive or not, but I missed three or four thrusday classes becuase mid week my migraine intensity, nausea inducing sinus headaches would keep me up for twenty-four or forty-eight hours and then I'd have to sleep all the next day.&nbsp; But this week has been 100 times better so far. I've been sleeping more AND its been better quality sleep.&nbsp; I'm even positive I have the time to start back up werking out and I'm sure as heck buying better food to eat since my kitchen mates and I are cooking together so often.&nbsp; </STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp; Tonight I have a lot of work to do since I have a Moot Off tomorrow and need to get my Skeleton arguments done. And Friday I'll have to do BUTT LOADS of reading for my intership, but I have the research I've done so far saved or printed off and all that remains is for me to read and analyize what I have. Not very hard, but time consuming. I also have to catch myself up on my class readings and notes, but it should be easliy enough done.&nbsp; And, my studies of Japanese is going decent as well.&nbsp; I'm trying to cover a chapter in at the most 2 classes.&nbsp; Grammer issues my be difficult, but I really don't want to pay for more than 24 hours...or $2,000 dollars. But I also want to be prepaired for the placement exam in January.<BR></STRONG></EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc66cc><EM><STRONG>&nbsp; To conclude, I think things are looking up agian. </STRONG></EM></FONT></P>"

Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.<BR><BR>2)Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.<BR><BR>3)Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.<BR><BR>4)Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.<BR><BR>5)Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Brittany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage could be destroyed.<BR><BR>6)Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.<BR><BR>7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.<BR><BR>8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a<BR>theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.<BR><BR>9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.<BR><BR>10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new<BR>social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans<BR><BR>Please post this in your journal if you are for gay marriage (or not, as you feel like it...) </EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366><STRONG><EM>I foud it amusing....</EM></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#663333>Also for the people who like to wank about fanfiction &amp; Plagrism....it was said to be bitchy that ""its only plagarism when it is twice removed from the orignal"".&nbsp; Well for that person and her own ""legion of bitchiness"" I'd like to give three little pieces of information:</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#663333>1.) Plagrism, in what ever definition you find, is generally referenced as taking anther word, ideas etc.. and NOT CITING the orginal sources.&nbsp; Erego, one can infring upon a copyright without plagarizing since plagarism is avoid by disclaimers giving reference to the copyright holders.&nbsp; THEFORE: Fanfics with said disclaimers are not plagarism.&nbsp; If your going to devote pages and pages of wank idiocy to this subject, get your terms right. And even 14 year olds know this is worng, a school would&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;hesitate in expelling them for it, as my mother is&nbsp;a principal&nbsp;I know this has happend several times.&nbsp;Age is not a defense againt punishment for&nbsp;EITHER plagarism or copyright infringment.&nbsp;</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#663333>2.) As for those who discount those who plagarize other fanifcs becuase of fanfiction in general being palgarism (which they are mistakingly calling copyright infrigment): Both Rumiko Takahasi and the Companies (Viz &amp; Sho Pro) that hold Copyright to Inuyasha, Ranma 1/2 etc., have expressly liscened derivitve works like fanfiction and fanart, both commerically and otherwise so long as it does not directly compete with the original.&nbsp; So, NO the VIZ bus will not show up at your door for writing your fanfic so long as you disclaim.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#663333>3.) For the person on Fandom-Wank who scoffed about Shakespere comming after people who use his ideas: Copyright does not last forever, it will survive the creator for 50 years, then it can no longer be enforced, BY ANYONE connected to the orignal. This is something called PUBLIC DOMAIN.&nbsp; LOOK IT UP BEFORE YOU WANK.&nbsp; That is why works by &nbsp;Shakespeare, Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, and other's like them are able to be used commerically without being cited to or paid for.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#663333>Now, to the person who enjoyed laughing at the email I sent to FF.net,&nbsp;since your not above&nbsp;monitoring other people's sites and wanking them for what is said there.&nbsp;&nbsp;FF.net's modirators&nbsp;are the ones with the duty of care to their members.&nbsp; Just becuase money doesn't exchange hands between it and its members does not mean they cannot be sued because they breech that duty, especially given the extensive evidence people like YOU have created that they treat accusations by cretain members more seriously than others, so I'd suggest you shut up with your own wankage. Money damages are not the only remedy available and yes FF.net could potentially be made to take their site.&nbsp; Now, when you site to a case and call my intelligence into question, making your attacks personal, maybe you should first go to law school and learn that a case may be used to reference several different law at once.&nbsp; I don't appreciate being called a ""Minon"" or a member of a ""Legion of Terror"" for using ONE case that I am aware of to express my point, and I don't appreciate you calling my intelligence into question, since I have not assumed you to be uninformed or stupid for being a housewife.&nbsp; However, your attiude and language have MORE than amply proved that opinion to be true.&nbsp; So, the next time YOU wank ME, get ALL your facts straight. </FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#663333>Oh...and to Capt_Koki....I am so very greatful to you for expressing you concern for both my employment and sexual situations...and by the way how DOES my pancreas taste?</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>

Stallone case didn't believe Anderson's assertion that he had a contract with MGM which would have negated a copyright issue.&nbsp; And that regardless, the law allows fanfiction author's protection by fair use, parody, implied consent.&nbsp; I have less of a soapbox than I do a dislike of being discounted and cursed at.&nbsp; I'm not the best typer or speller, I've never claimed different, but before you start swearing at me for not reading something closly enough, don't do the same yourself.&nbsp; Oh and Ironically, the person giving me such flack for trying to explain where a fanfiction can be plagerized, is her self a member of the LJ Anti-Plagerism Community that is all about stoping people from stealing other people's fanfictions....huh.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternativly, although my alcohol and smoke smelling roomate kept me up wanting to throw up for most of the night, I got my third chappie up.&nbsp; I got a review asking if this was gonna be a Mary Sue/Self insertion fic, and I wanted to be able to ask them which character they were thinking of and where the got the feeling from, since I've been struggling with getting the jist of Yukio's first impression of the girl across w/o doing that since she's not going to be so nice in the next several chappies.&nbsp;They didn't sign in though to let me ask.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll just have to nip that in the bud before it gets outta hand. Alright...to bed...maybe, if my head stops hurting.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#663366>So today got off to a great start.&nbsp;A couple people I talk to seem to be taking a game of their way to damn seriously and can't handle when people joke back with them.&nbsp; I don't have much patience for them much anymore and I have to wonder at what pint things stopped being abut haveing fun and when it became so fucking serious.&nbsp; Then my roomate comes back from a walk to bitch me out about 1. not vacuming the room 2. not having bought toliet paper 3. not taking the garbage out 4. random clutter issues 5. the fact i eat my food in the room and 6. that I leave my dishes in the sink.&nbsp; All of this she decides to bring up NOW after me being like I am for 2 months and her leaving in 5 days.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>1. I admit I have not vaccumed..but to be fair, she has only done so once so yelling at me for not doing it is a bit hypocritical.&nbsp; She did steal the duat pan brush from the kitchen and will sweep stuff ut into the hall occasionally for the cleasners to sweep up, so I am willing to say I could be better about that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>2. She blows up at me that she's not going to buy toilet paper agian after buying it the last 2 times.&nbsp; When I bought it I got a double.&nbsp; She complained she gave me 60 cents for it but when a double pack costs $5..... enough said don't blow up about it when I was going out today anyway.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>3. I can stand to have a full garbage can.&nbsp; Ususally its papers or empty plastic bottles or bags so its not much of an issue for me.&nbsp; It is fr her and she'll ususally take it out before I even realize how full it is becuase its no big deal for me.......agian ask dont yell.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>4. As to the clutter..yes its a smalll room but all my shit is contained w/in a small area.&nbsp; The soul exception being oxes Ihave ahd for a bout a month that I intend to mail home, when I figure I can afford to.&nbsp; But her shit is strewn about the room and her huge ass suitcase blocks the door so we have to squeeze thru.....whose cluttered???</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>5. Eating in my room...agian if I had know this was an issue I wouldn't t it.&nbsp; The kitchen is gross...I mean the kitchen is rarely cleaned and when one of them cooks they just leave it for a few days...so I dont like being in there much less to eat there. And I have shit to do&nbsp;or their are loads of people I dont know in the common room&nbsp;or kitchen.&nbsp;So I eat in my room. As to the lack f ventillation....she keeps out room freezing....its cold out and she keeps the window open and runs a fan...I close the window becuase I'm cold and its kept me sick on and off. Again...mention it nicley don't yell. And if she wants to bitch about the rom smelling of food, maybe she should stop letting her loud ass firnds smoke in here...food or cigarrette smoke?? Huh...which once will make someone sick....gurrr equally rude I feel.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>6. Dishes are supposed to be in a sink.&nbsp; We have a dishwasher yes, but I'm not use to these things s I eat put my dishes in the sink and come back later or the next day to wash them....I can't do that if they take them first...If you dont want to do somone else's dishes.don't Don't just do them then yell at them when your the one who does trash the kitchen more often than not.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>GOD I hate ranting but I am so SICK of people yelling at me. AHHHHHHHHH.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

The first one didn't strart ut that way and really creeped me out the most.&nbsp; I was hanging in my apartment (alhtough it was not one I knew I just knew it was mine) with a guy from high school and some other guy I knew.&nbsp; We were going ut to dinner, they left and I was going to follow. When I got out inot the hallway, a lady was comeing thru a doorway across the hall wearing a red kimono. I recognized her as a woman I knew who died a few years back and she asked me if she culd ""just go in there?"" and was trying to walk into my apartment. Her eyes were kinda redish, so I kpet pushing her back toward the doorway saying ""Not yet.""&nbsp; I almost had her back to the doorway when I noticed in a mirror on the ground that her face looked weird so I tried to lift it up but she wouldn't do it and went ape on me saying I'd regret it more than anything if I did that and grabbed my arm and pushed me down the hall all mean like and as I was insanly pushing the down button on the elevator calling for help I managed to wake myslef up.&nbsp; Dream #2 involved my firends haveing flim records of me in possibl posession &amp; the one I just had invovled me on a southern USA beach, but in London, when my best friends was visiting but was too busy for me just then.&nbsp; So I went to the beach and while trying to get a ferry back across by th little inflater raft ferries, I fell into the big rubber &amp; wanter and kinda began to drown, no matter how clse to the man trying to help me I got he couldn;t haul me up and anther one was holding my head under, all the time i was afraid of crocodiles.......

"event","<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d8d0c8"" color=#663366>My Great Uncle has a couple of friends who ran a really fancy hotel in the French Quarter.&nbsp;In fact, he helped them run it during the busy season. &nbsp;The men stayed at the hotel since&nbsp;the French Quarter is above sea level and not flood.&nbsp; They were worried about looters breaking&nbsp;in and destroying the place. The&nbsp;one man's 80 year old uncle had a house/apartment a few streets over in the French Quarter from the hotel and refused to leave, becuase he was old an stubborn like that.&nbsp; The men finally were able to go check on him yesterday.&nbsp; They found him SHOT DEAD and his home LOOTED.&nbsp; There are stories about National Gaurdsmen having to shoot and kill a man while he was raping a 13 YEAR OLD GIRL in the Superdome.&nbsp; Also apparently after the intial flood settle people from the outer areas, both white and black, who had any kind of boat flocked to the city to pick up survivors, but weren't allowed into the city becuase looters and snipers were shooting at the boats trying to kill the people trying to rescue survivors.&nbsp; The once beautiful Garden District, where I visited Anne Rice's home years ago, was demolished.&nbsp; Not but the floods, but by looters hauling off big screen tvs they had nowhere to take or sell or any electricty to even use.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d8d0c8"" color=#663366>Now, what I am about to say will offend some but they know where they can stick it becuase this is something I feel needs to be said.&nbsp; New Orleans is in trouble.&nbsp; It has been for a long time. Long before Katrina and the levy breaking. I don not have the exact figures, but having family in law enforcement, I know that <EM>New Orleans </EM>was and is the most dangerous city in America with the rape and murder rate insanly high.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d8d0c8"" color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets look at New York in 9/11.&nbsp; Yes the destruction in New Orleans greatly excceeds what happened to the towers; HOWEVER, the panic at being vulnerable to enemy attacks were, I would say, just as great as well as totally unexpected. At least the South had a few days to prepare for Katrina.&nbsp; Now, when New York City was attacked did we see any of this insanity? No. Are there just as many poor non white people in New York as there are in New Orleans. Yes. Maybe more, I don't know. So to say that the reason why the fallout in New Orleans was&nbsp;totally about&nbsp;racial prejdice is short sighted and&nbsp;not productive.&nbsp; Personally, as a 20 something white female,&nbsp;if&nbsp;I encountered&nbsp;a gang of white boys/men who prided themselves on&nbsp;dressing, talking and acting like hoods, who praised themsleves a ""pimps"" with all their ""bitches and&nbsp;hoes""&nbsp;and bragging how they were going to ""bust a cap"" in someone, I would be scared out of my mind.&nbsp; You want to know why people in the rest of the country are freaked out at the thought of having refugees in their towns is not becuase the white middle &amp; upper classes&nbsp;are afraid of the poor black people.&nbsp; Its becuase they're terrified of the thugs, rapists, murders, gang members, drug dealors and criminals that have festered in the Big Easy and have chosen this time of tragedy and disaster to bubble up to the surface.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d8d0c8"" color=#663366>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am NOT talking about the poor people who have been forced to pillage drugstores or convience stores for basic necessities. I am NOT talking about the people who have been driven to panic at being surrounded by dead boides and terror at being victimized who are randomly shooting at ambulances and gaurd trucks to call for help.&nbsp; I am NOT even talking about the frienzied masses who rush rescuse helicopters and buseses.&nbsp; These people were left alone to fend for themselves with no guideance or leadership to let them know things would be okay.&nbsp; I am talking about the dregs of society, the scum that resides under bog soddened rocks. THE PROBLEM (which I would venture to guess is not even the majority of the refugee popultion) is the worthless excuses for humanity that shot 80 year old men dead in their homes to steal electronics they can't even uses or rape little girls in a mass of people. This type of scum does not contain itself to one skin color, gender or religion.&nbsp; Then you add on a weak, unprepaired, ineffective ""governmental body"" and the result is what has happend.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d8d0c8"" color=#663366>&nbsp; I know you could never prepair completly for a disaster of this magnitude, but you CAN at least put into place procedures and systems to ensure that you don't abandon survivors to their&nbsp;own devices for so long while you organize yourselfs, so you don't have police officers quiting left right and center or panicked overstreatched young graudsmen being attacked.&nbsp; You don't just open your prison cells up and release it population back into the city when flooding begins, you transfer them out into other prisons in other states before it gets to that point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #d8d0c8"" color=#663366>&nbsp; Another point, which I admit that I have not heard personally being here in London, but my mother does not lie nor exaggerates the truth, is the rap stars or militiant leaders of the African American community, well I've only heard of Jesse Jackson, who are supposedly getting on tv and pointing fingers and flinging accusations about who is shooting who.&nbsp; Now I don't know if&nbsp; Jesse Jackson or these visited New Orleans. If they have, good for them.&nbsp; But until they live whats going on down there for themselves, which I admit I am not either, then they can talk till their blue in the face about how white americans are only shooting the people becuase they're black and that becuase they're balck the rest of America doesn't care.&nbsp; I think with as much money as those men have seen in the past few decades they don't even know what it means to be a poor African American anymore, and I am NOT saying that I do.&nbsp; I am reminded of when three black teenagers where expelled from a neigbhoring high school to mine in Illinois a few years ago.&nbsp; My mother, being an admisitrator knew that those students had been suspended and warned, before they chased and beat another student through the crowded bleachers, that the next offense would result in expulsion.&nbsp; Jesse Jackson swaned in and made it into a media mess, saying they kids were expelled becuase they were black.&nbsp; No, they were expelled becuase they broke the rules and started fights too many times.&nbsp; My point is: you wanna help, don't talk, don't lay blame, don't rant on about white opression, get off you pampered butt and go down there or to your nearst volunteer station or blood bank or food pantry&nbsp;and actually DO something to help.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>Okay...that is my rant. Take it for what it is, if you don't agree or my facts are <EM>TRUELY </EM>wrong (not just contradicting conspiricy theories) then you don't have to listen to me and can ignore me and go about your lives.&nbsp; My uncle has been deeply saddened by the loss of his friend and his other friends' grief. And the idea of people who have no idea what life there is like right now trying to use it as a plaform for a political sound bite makes me violently ill.....Alright I am done.&nbsp; I am going to the gym, order a pizza, and do my work.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

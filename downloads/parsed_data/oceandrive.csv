These books just evoke memories. I think I got the Madrid Lonely Planet in one of the bookstores around Vaclavske Namesti in Prague in 2004. I purchased the booklet on Sevilla in a Relay store at the Madrid Atocha Train station 2006. On the same trip, I got the book on Bilbao at the Guggenheim and the book on Basque Country somewhere in Donostia. I did buy dictionaries and cookbooks but I couldn't find it at the office.<br /><br />2006 was the year I made one of my dreams come true. After a tiring preparation and implementaion of a project in the Czech Republic, the only request I had was to have time to visit the Basque Region. So 2006 was done when I was finally able to visit San Sebastian and Bilbao.<br /><br />So many things have happened in the last two years that shifted my attention towards the UK. I've always had the impression that my past was dominated by anything related to the Czech Republic but there was Spain. Two years of my life devoted to all sorts of things Spanish.<br /><br />The only reason I see myself going to Spain again would be en route to Morocco. Other than that it would probably pintxos-hopping in San Sebastian, celebrating in Madrid with Liv or materializing one of those crazy dreams me and Emma share at Las Ramblas in Barcelona.<br /><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://images.laska.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/R8E-NgoKCCsAADX32uQ1/P1010840.JPG?et=lED4JfkttdK%2CJo5Uc5Fneg&amp;nmid=&amp;nmid=83421894""><img border=""0"" style=""margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;"" src=""http://images.laska.multiply.com/image/1/photos/upload/300x300/R8E-NgoKCCsAADX32uQ1/P1010840.JPG?et=lED4JfkttdK%2CJo5Uc5Fneg&amp;nmid=&amp;nmid=83421894"" alt="""" /></a>Do the Chinese characters below reflect the English line above?<br /><br /><font style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pimientos Rellenos de Bacalao</font><br /><a onblur=""try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"" href=""http://bp3.blogger.com/_42FfE7Ns1LQ/R8GGs9MlnBI/AAAAAAAAAD0/_FiYYSrgjnE/s1600-h/DSC00376.JPG""><img border=""0"" style=""margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 261px; height: 244px;"" src=""http://bp3.blogger.com/_42FfE7Ns1LQ/R8GGs9MlnBI/AAAAAAAAAD0/_FiYYSrgjnE/s320/DSC00376.JPG"" alt="""" id=""BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170561954097765394"" /></a><font style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ingredients:</font><br />Piquillo peppers (small red bell peppers)<br />Salt Cod (sole fillet could be a substitute)<br />flour, milk<br />onion, garlic<br />butter<br /><br /><font style=""font-weight: bold;"">Method:</font><br />Boil the fish in water and flake when done.

Meanwhile, roast the peppers and skin when done. Stuff the peppers with the fish and bechamel mixture.<br /><br />Served with salad: Romaine lettuce, parmesan shavings, olive oil, calamansi juice, salt and pepper.<br /><br />I had such a Spanish vibe all day I felt like making one of my favourite pintxos. Maybe someday, after I end up in a profession I'll stay for a <font style=""font-style: italic;"">long </font>time I can do an entry I added to my dreamlist in 2007.<br /><br />I want to open something similar to <a href=""http://www.streetvoices.com.au/"">Koto</a>. Inspired by VSO's mantra of ""sharing skills, changing lives"", I came across Koto when I was browsing the Lonely Planet website last year. It's a non-profit resto providing culinary training to street children. Religious groups in the Philippines have been doing this (e.g. Don Bosco and the Opus Dei) but one more wouldn't hurt right? Yes, I can cook and others could too.<br /><br />Just came across another useful <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/916_dev_speak/index.shtml"">source </a>for development terms. There's really something about these Commonwealth countries. I wonder."

Through the decades, major hurdles came his way yet it didn't deter him from moving forward. From failed policy initiatives to losing the presidential election, he just continued his journey and did what he wanted to do. That's passion and determination. Now those failures don't matter. Other people had their time in the limelight, but now it's his time to shine. It's even more prestigious than occupying a certain position or being affiliated with a certain organization because he did it as a private citizen. Baby steps towards the bigger goal paving the way for others to join in the fight.<br /><br />Then there's people like Ryan Anson. (See <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/flash_point/southeastasia/interview.html"">http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/flash_point/southeastasia/interview.html</a>). Living and working with Muslims for me was a personal one as I was really trying to understand the distinction between religion and culture. Through the article I realized even open-minded people can have limited understanding until they become immersed in the actual reality of things.I forwarded this article to a lot of people and I only received one reply. A thesis respondent of mine from the World Bank knew Ryan as his father was working with the WB country office in the Philippines until he retired. Changing mindsets and point of views is the first and major step towards action. He was from a family of dev workers yet nothing comes close to experiencing things for oneself in bridging the understanding divide. And through his experience, share it with those who don't have opportunities to be there or have no sense of the issue at all. <br /><br />So even if it takes long for results to show, patience and perseverance pays off eventually. Not having results now just means you'll get it in the future and it could be even better!"

View from the Giralda Tower

Over breakfast, Eula told me that Whitby was featured on <a href=""http://www.pilotguides.com/tv_shows/globe_trekker/shows/europe/historic_england.php/"">Globe Trekker </a> last night together with other destinations in England. We were the only Filipino volunteers this year who were able to go to Whitby so naturally, we were the only ones who could relate to each other. She also mentioned that when she was raving about having gone to <a href=""http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/movies/Garfield2MoviePosterTrailerBillMurray.php /"">Castle Howard </a> which was where Garfield the movie was shot, her friends didn't bother to react. A few minutes ago, <a href=""http://travel.discovery.com/tv/samantha-brown/passport-europe/postcards/seville/photo.html/"">Samantha Brown's Passport to Europe </a> featured Sevilla. I was there last year and never really wrote about it. Just uploaded 5 photos in multiply that doesn't really capture the allure of that Andalusian city.  One of my life's blessings is to see a place on tv and say, hey I've been there! Ate there, walked there, smalled those orange trees-lined plazas, went up the Giralda tower (located in the biggest cathedral in the world!), lost myself in the maze of the Alcazar, strolling along the Plaza Espana (which is full of tiles!!!) and so much more.

The Travel Channel's got another show called <a href=""http://travel.discovery.com/tv/1000-places/about.html/"">1000 Places to Visit Before You Die</a> which I've only see one episode of: Sydney. The couple hosting the show put their lives on hold to travel the world for 14 weeks. They mentioned about being criticized for putting their life on hold just to travel. Their response, ""why not?"" I'm guilty of putting my life on hold depending on which perspective you have and I'm doing it again, hopefully just for another month. October will pass as I put my life on hold and this time, it is for a different reason.  I was supposed to spend the first week of November in Prague to attend a travel fair and extend a few days to see former classmates I haven't seen since March 2006. Putting your life on hold certainly has trade-offs. At least I'm spending the weekend in Palawan, even if it's still work. Volunteerism-related work."

Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself.

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy.

So many things to be done in the next two days. That includes everything related to the photo. I'm still not done with ECDP and I still have to buy a Filipiniana attire. I don't like the traditional baro't saya that would either make me look like Imelda Marcos or a Kamayan waitress. Thank God the Supervsion Mission Report cover provides choices.

Then I realized I'm half a semester done. I've gathered all the data last year and I just have to write and I have barely written anything. 

When Kaye and I met this afternoon to discuss her travel plans, my thesis panelist happened to be there as well. He congratulated and encouraged us regarding our upcoming (hopefully it materializes) endeavors in Europe. He said it's good to go out and be exposed. He even went as far as saying, ""you know how it is in the Philippines, the perspective is still very insular despite of everything."" I thought he was going to say ""national."" As soon as I heard ""insular"" I was just plunged into Spanish era. weird. But he also reminded me to finish the damn thesis. In a very good and encouraging way. Stop being O.C. in gist.

I wanted to ask him about getting a Tapas DVD but he didn't have a clue. Turns out he wasn't from IC but he was the Executive Producer of Barcelona.&nbsp;So instead of Tapas info, he invited us to watch <a href=""http://manila.cervantes.es/Cultura/Fichas/Ficha23_2_38516.htm"">Barcelona </a>at MyCinema. Thank you. There were probably just less than twenty of us who watched the midnight screening. The movie's planned to be commercially released in December. <br /><br />My take on the movie? It's like Dubai or Milan minus the superstar factor of the actors. It just has in interesting twist in the end with matching promotion of *insert place here* because the executive producer's family owns it. So the movie has a different ending from Dubai and Milan, which I do not intend to disclose. :) Since I like Alessandra already, I'm biased.&nbsp; I saw her being interviewed earlier that evening as I finished watching El Milagro de Candeal. Ang ganda-ganda at totoo lang nya in an Angel Locsin/Angel Aquino/Miriam Quiambao effortless and innate way. Pinay&nbsp;na&nbsp;pinay&nbsp;(although half but aren't we all mongrels anyway?) but not the ecxotic/Cafe Havana/OFW type.&nbsp;In the movie, her character was often asked, ""bago ka lang dito? Turista o OFW?"" Her reply, ""hindi. hinahanap ko ang asawa ko.""<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"">I viewed the movie more as a travel person than your average moviegoer. Unfortunately, it failed to show the true vibe of BCN. If you watch Sex and the City, you feel New York. You don't watch Sound of Music to see Salzburg but you finish the movie intrigued and possibly want to see it for yourself. I'm sure that wasn't the point of the movie but it could've highlighted the city's assets. The OFW culture was practically limited to where Tina Paner performs almost every night. They could've shown the church frequented by Pinoys that has a Filipino Parish Priest. Yun lang. Crazy for You does a better job in showing what Barcelona is all about. <br /><br />The photo at the right is Palau Nacional. It's a massive stucture in Montjuic and you'll pass by it going to and from the airport towards the city center. I only took two photos of this museum complex: one from the center and this <em>gilid</em> version. hehehe Luckily, in the movie, de Rossi and Alandy kiss under those lamp posts. I just like rows and rows of pretty things. Lamp posts and trees included. <br /><br />As we were watching the movie, my mom and I were practically talking and talking about BCN. We were both guessing the locations and figuring out their names. We talked about how my mother asked the guards of the Sagrada Familia to let us in after closing time because I wanted to see the interior and the museum. And we were able to do so and even hear mass at the underground chapel. We were partly missing the home of the Pinker Tones and so much more. We were talking about her upcoming return to BCN this year as we're planning to launch a Catalan gastronomic tour next year. Since we're into food and Catalonia, <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/innovators/culinary/profile_adria.html"">Ferran Adria</a> was a consultant in Tapas too. I loved BCN. I like it more than Madrid. Did you know that ambient music originated in BCN? It was introduced as background music in the trains from the airport to the city. Have you noticed that jazz music is played at the MRT? I don't take the MRT everyday but I've heard jazz music played twice. niiiice. :-) Before I slept last night, I realized I've seen more of Spain than the Czech Republic. Interesting realization since I've always assumed I've seen more of the latter. Hindi pala. Anyway, I can't wait for the latest Bond film, Casino Royale,since parts of it were shot in the royal spa town of Karlovy Vary in western Bohemia. Note to self: Get <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Holiday"">Last Holiday</a>&nbsp;DVD. I hope MCS provides. <br /><br />Now let's talk about Paris. I was talking to my mom and my cousin Tennise last night while watching Sex and the City. Paris appealed to me just as much as Vienna did. Char and I agree that Paris is overrated about the shopping and romanticism. Anyway, Tennise is making me reconsider my opinion since she grew up in Paris. At some time in the far future, the deal is she takes me around in Paris and I take her around in Prague.<br /><br />And if ever Emma and I go back to Barcelona at the same time, we'd still like to make our dream happen in Las Ramblas. Something related to Alan Paule's role but we'd have Pinoy products with us.<br /><br />One entry is not enough for a day, a week,&nbsp;a year or whatever. But as the character's in Bebo Valdes' trip in Candeal said, you just got to keep talking and sharing. El Milagro de Candeal set in Brazil deserves another entry.&nbsp; So even if it's not intellectually stimulating (which is a big deal!) and is mostly stressful, I like my job. My mother got her wish in Montserrat. that made me cry so hard so&nbsp;I hate all my puffy-eyed pics in that Marian shrine. &nbsp;Montserrat is part of the movie too. :)</div>"

Liv suggested Ninette and No sos vos, soy yo. I practically wanna watch all films except El Abuelo. I specifically wanna watch <a href=""http://manila.cervantes.es/Cultura/Fichas/Ficha23_2_38351.htm""> El Milagro de Candeal</a> since it involves Carlinhos Brown. My mom just got me a CD of Marisa Monte from Brazil last week and some of the songs were written by Carlinhos Brown. Very interesting.

The danger of writing yourself towards an ending that need never be told. At a certain point the story gathers momentum. It convinces itself, and does its best to convince you, that the end in sight is the only possible outcome. There is a fatefulness and a loss of control that are somehow comforting. This was your script, but now it writes itself (Winterson, 2001)."

The World Challenge is basically a   competition/search designed at   identifying groups or individuals all over the   world   whose projects have   contributed great impact at grass roots level. 

    A documentary about Philippine Coconut geotextile or coconet industry will be shown on the BBC World cable channel on   September 24  around 8:30 GMT and will also  be featured in the August 29 special issue of Newsweek.  ""The World Challenge"" already offers a tremendous exposure and publicity to our flourishing Philippine coconut geotextile industry and to our Philippine coconut fiber exporters.   But it would be great   liberation for our country, which has been getting very bad publicity nowadays, to win this prestigious competition. 
       
    To vote, please open www.theworldchallenge.co.uk and click the picture of Philippine coconet.
       
    Please help us campaign for more voters by forwarding this message to your co-workers,  friends and relatives.

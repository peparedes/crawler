<TD>So, you want to make the world a better place? Too bad it's never gonna happen. 
<P>Of all the types, you have to be one of the hardest to find fault in. You have a selfless and caring nature. You're a good listener and someone who wants to avoid conflict. You genuinely desire to do good. 
<P>Of course, these all add up to an incredibly overpowered conscience which makes you feel guilty and responsible when anything goes wrong. Of course, it MUST be your fault EVERYTIME. 
<P>Though you're constantly on a mission to find the truth, you have no use for hard facts and logic, which is a source of great confusion for those of us with brains. Despite this, in a losing argument, you're not above spouting off inaccurate fact after fact in an effort to protect your precious values. 
<P>You're most probably a perfectionist, which in this case, is a bad thing. Any group work is destined to fail because of your incredibly high standards.
<P>Disregard what I said before. You're just easy to find fault in as everyone else! 
<P>Luckily, you're generally very hard on yourself, meaning I don't need to waste my precious time insulting you. Instead, just find all your own faults and insult yourself.

<img src='http://hotshotec.icons.ljtoys.org.uk/mi/dot.gif' border=0 alt=''>
Note to self: Watching second half of greys anatomy that jiggles and moves across the screen cos you want to watch it is not a good idea. Will make you nauseous. Motion Sickness another bane of my existence. Means no 1st player type games. Forget about sea travel. Funnily enough, car and air travel is perfectly fine. Don't know why though? Another strange inner workings of me.

I should really change my ring tone.I've missed far too many phone calls on the basis of the ring tone starting out real quiet. So by the time 6 rings are done, it aint too loud.

Also why does most people want to contact me when i'm actually working out at the gym? For that 1-2 hours, I always get at least one missed call or one txt awaiting me when i return to the locker and retrive my stuff. It's funny. It's all about Murphys Law i suppose.

Had Hells Pizza last night. Pasta/Pizza and Chicken Tenders. I only ate about 1/2 the pasta and all the chicken tenders (6) and one piece of pizza. Pretty tame portions wise compared to the type of portions that i used to be able to consume!!! My stamoch has shrunk. The 2 nights of pizza also made me go ""o.k i must eat healthy and be healthy for next week at least"". I started tonight. Sorta. Haha! 

Still nauseous .... Kinda bored now....

Want something to do... but theres nothing really to do...

Ah well. Can't complain too much. It'll be worse if i actually wasn't here.

Big note to everyone who reads this. I'm going to post the MAJORITY of my posts under Friends. So i doubt you'll see much public posting goodness from now on. So if you want to read my latest pointless musings and going on in my life, best log on. And if you aren't actually on my Friends list, then comment on one of the posts to be added and i shall add you (provided that you pass my test - Cheese: Yay? or Nay?!) Pretty easy to figure out ;)

Sucks that this computer is using USB 1.1. I'm hesistant to upload music on my iPod because its going to take DAYS just to get a couple new songs onto it. I think i'll survive until i have the use of a USB 2.0 port. I hope. Haha!

Its been nice chilling out having some alone time. I like it.

Again <b> LAST PUBLIC POST </b> in a while. So Please Comment to be added or log on.

Well NOT the financial side of it but stuff like sleeping in till 11 am everyday? Mint!

For those who don't know, yes i am unemployed, no it does not mean that i am job searching. Haha.

Cos yes i have lined up a  job for myself already but it just doesn't start until next year so its going to be a nice long break for me. Recharge my batteries and regain my motivation to work and be excited about work again. This year has sapped it completely so i'm quite enjoying the novel-ness that is unemployment until the relisation that i've suddenly watched what i've been spending my $$ on hits. Which has just started! haha!

I have to remind myself i have to get my WOF done today. I'm going to be lazy, i'll just head to the test station next to the gym so i can just get it done and pop over right after for my gym session. Which is very soon. And i should get some food into me before i start. Which means i have a net 20minutes to actually get my ass into gear to get ready to get out. haha. I really do hope nothing fails :S I don't have the actual motivation to go fix it just to get the WOF as my moods not exactly happy but not exactly crappy as well. So its sitting nicely into this middle zone that i describe as ""oh well"". Thats if this mood can be put into words that is!

"event","I had a craving for oranges. So i went and got oranges. At the same time I saw some golden kiwi fruits. COLD ones. So i grabbed them. Then i got thinking..now i have to get dinner. Tenderbasted Chilli & Lime Chicken cooked, ready to go...mmmmmmm....Then i thought..wait wheres my greens? You know the healthy part to the meal? So mixed bag of frozen veges went into my basket. And THEN i walked past this chicken hot pot meal...well ok you get my drift....

Supermarket Shopping is addictive. You head in to grab ONE thing and you end up coming up with 4 bags. I resisted buying ice cream though..but mmmmm so tempted to get ice cream!!

So woke up horrendously late again. Well actually early as I woke up at 6am for some reason and then fell asleep and woke up at 11pm. Dragged my ass off to the gym and then drove to town to meet anna for lunch. Hung out with D & Co for roughly 1/2 hour and then went on my shopping expedition.

Nothing exciting.

The date is looming. Large and in my face! What do I do? So kinda gutted i'm not able to hand it in in time. What do I do? I think i'll probably throw a tantrum. haha. Might not. Depends.

Cos now i've got a funky new LJ look and funky new user pics! haha!  I was thinking that i could make the userpics myself with ME in them instead of borrowing other peoples pictures. But i dont like looking at myself in pictures so why endulge that at this current moment? 

Yea lets stick to the status quo.

So after last nights horrendously late bedtime > 3am. I woke up pretty late, around 11am. At which i proceeded to head to the gym to do my 1 hr of cardio, back home. Did my core. Showered. Headed out to Vodafone to sign up for Prepay Roaming (Yes! I can be contacted while overseas! But note i might not answer calls cos yes people ANSWERING CALLS OVERSEAS = MONEY!!!!). RECEIVING TXTS = MONEY as well. So please..unless its important :P . Okies ? Sweet As? Cool! We ARE sorted.

Then went to feed my car with its food that it was lacking (petrol). Then off to WestField Manukau at 2pm to meet up with Peter for a late late lunch. Thats what you get for waking up late!!!!

Now i'm back here. Feeling a bit tired. Thinking about sleeping. But probably won't. Maybe. Haha. Posting on my LJ and wondering what my mood is at this current moment so what UserPic i should use. HMMMMmmm Choices! They're all so hard!!!!!!!

So i felt that my one and only userpic didn't quite ""speak"" to my emotions on this LJ. On the wayside if you guys are reading this on your Friends Page, head over to the actual Journal. I've changed the Look n Feel of it. Kinda budget and quick but it looks pretty cool. Although not quite unique and to be honest even though i probably have time to make it look exactly how i want it to look like i doubt i'll be expanding my energy.

Its cold tonight and i've successfully managed to piss off my family by changing my departure date several times in a row. I can also forsee the arguments that i'm going to get with them by refusing to take the Bus to KL. I know i know..the bus..nothign wrong with that! But there is!!!!!!! No one understands why i hate the bus to go to KL!!! Maybe i'll suck it in and just do it. *sigh*

<i> We talk all the time, you and i, its alright..we're the same soul...</i>

So yes officially i am going on the 4th December 0105am. Yes youve read that correctly i am flying off at 1:05AM IN THE MORNING!!! I think i've managed to escape the $75 reissue charge by calling Singapore Airlines in Singapore rather than NZ Singapore Airlines. *cross fingers* that i dont get surprised with unexpected charges!!! So yes in the relevation of pissing off family, i have lined up a couple of willing ppl to come drive me to the airport. Which is very ideal. I like how people don't mind doing that for me. Yet i feel bad for asking and almost hold my breathe to see who would say yes and who would say no...Is that bad? Maybe! haha

<i> I don't need, I dont need to hear you say, that if we weren't so alike, you'll like me a whole lot more...</i>

I've reached my goal that i set myself physically from the gym/eating. Went out to celebrate by eating unhealthily at La Porchetta. Pasta/Chessy Bread and Grilled chicken! Yum!!! Then i felt massive guilty pains and went to the gym today when originally i didn't plan to go to the gym! Haha! Yes its become a habit now this gym. If i dont go i feel really really awful and its bordering on the obsessive compulsive. So much so, i must really look that i dont go mental over it. its just that ive been doing this massive amount of effort for the past 4 months and for it to go to waste even for one little second will just be a major dissapointment to me. Cue the expected let go period while i'm overseas as well means that i'm determined not to let go at this current moment so i dont go backwards too much while i'm overseas. This plays into the reasons why i'm trying to delay my departure as well. Having spent a hard 2 weeks loosing 7 kgs all that effort and to waste that effort while overseas? Its going to be a major dissapointment! So i really have to work hard up until i leave. Then work extra hard when i come back again just to get back to where i am and then improve until i am happy again. Haha i sound like a girl. Dont Judge me.


<i> Where are we now? I've got to let you know, A house still doesn't make a home, don't leave me here alone </i>

I just went through a year and a halfs worth of my private/public entries. Man did i ever have so much anger stored up during those times. Was apparent that i was real happy that time too :). I have approximately 2 more years to trawl through. Wish me luck!

Alrighty. Don't think i have anything else to update now. So.

Yesterday was my joint leaving morning tea with Stewart but he's sick so it was just me. with all eyes on me. as ppl gave speeches..lol....i gots a bottle of 42 Below Honey..yum..

Leaving dinner tonight!! Got roughly 20 people coming. Should be good. We're heading to Thai Chilli @ the Viaduct but i have to restrict my menu to Fish and Veges unfortunately. I was planning to miss the gym today but because its kinda off the food plan, i think i'll head over early and bear the busy busy busy gym and do as much cardio as possible just so i dont completely off my target of 5kgs in 2 weeks. :P i'm down around 2-3kgs now and its 1/2 way through the 1st week so i'm going pretty good. Just have to resist all nice food temptations which is bloody hard to tell you!!!


I am looking quite forward to leaving in 2 days..can't wait :D !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hopefully i'll have enough money to last me through till i start work again.haha!! Knowing me, i'll spend like heaps :P

So whats the haps guys?

Nothing much on my part to be honest. Ive only got 13 working days left at my work and thats got me excited! Not long now!!!

Got an eye infection. First it was in the corner and now its migrated to my eyelid and is getting a bit conjunctivitisy so if it gets worse i'll prob go get some eye drops from the doctors. So this long weekend is drawing to a close (DAMN). i wish it went longer :P

Felt a bit distressed this weekend. For no particular reason as well. Can't put my finger on it either. Ah well. Prob a small combination of things that are insignificant and then creates this feeling of distressed. Maybe i'm just talking out of my ass. LOL.

So lets do weekend recap. Friday . I remember going to the gym. Doing upper body stuff. Stuffed my arms and shoulders . First time my left arm really left me down which was dissapointing. Then came home and just blobbed for the night. Saturday, got up, went to the gym, came back, ate something yummy (KEBABS) and then waited till 10pm at night and headed out to Davids place (Judys, sisters Annas boyfriend) out in Henderson in West. Drove to Allees, parked and we mished over there. They had healthy snacks with dip which was cool :) Played Singstar and Buzz which i was kinda over it but it was an ok night. Felt tired so maybe i wasn't enjoying myself that much. Finally got home and to sleep at 330am. lol and woke up at 2pm the next day!!!!!!! OMG THE HORROR!!!

Sunday. was basically a write off :P I can't really remember what i did on sunday. I think it was RnR and maybe throw in a bit of emo and feeling sorry for myself at night as some people can attest to from talking to them on MSN and my random phone calls HAHA.

Today, got up. Did some grocery shopping which cost less than i usually spend (BONUS!!) came back and felt like Movenpick ice cream. So waylaid the first person on my msn list that i could tempt which involved driving all the way to Te Atatu to pick up Brad to go to Mission Bay for ice cream. HmmmMmm I shouldn't have done that but meh i'm allowed in indulge once in a while. It was good comfortable convo and hanging out time with nice ice cream :) Then home where i was more tired than usual and actually fell asleep for about an hour. i know sucks. now i'm wide awake, feeling distressed (again dont know why) and i'm killing time.

So thats my wonderful exciting weekend. How was yours? What did you do?"

"event","Last week was rough as at work. I'm so glad i'm leaving.

To cut a long story short, work absolutely killed my mood to live last week. I was actually BUSY with work and i put myself in that position and i was enjoying actually having things to do constantly. What i object to is the treatment i get from people who treat me like a doormat and also some senior manager treating me like a little kid, incapable of doing anything. *SIGH* What i also object to is getting volunteered for work which i can't fit in and when i said i couldn't fit it in, i get insults thrown at me like ""cheeky bastard"" and ""fucking fucker"". I just had my fill and took Thursday off to have a well needed mental break. To be quite honest i can't be bothered with it anymore, i'm glad i'm leaving. i'm just not glad that i'm not leaving soon enough.

The thought has crossed my mind that i could abandoned my job but that would not leave a great impression and i don't think i'll do that unless they really push me to my limit times 3000000. I'm a passionate person at the best of times when i truly believe in something but i'd like to think my toleration levels are actually quite high. However, work as well and truly made me reach my toleration levels and when its affecting your mental health, u just want to get out of there as soon as possible. Started work at 7am today which was very novel and i'm contemplating doing the same tomorrow. Gives me a nice period of peace and quiet before i have to deal with *cough* . Deep breathes is what i need. 

Work has truly made my mood grumpy as i struggle to seperate myself from it after work or during my breaks. It was funny cos on friday i really needed to punch something and what do ya know, my Personal Trainer Willy had planned a boxing circuit for me to do haha. It was awesome. I was abit unco and also terribly exhausted by the end of it but it was truly a good way to defrustrate myself.

Life is trudging on, i'm looking forward to the long weekend purely and solely the fact that i dont have to go into work for one day haha! Found an apartment in town which is quite cool.

Gym is going well. Not as fast as i would prefer it but thats the fact of life :P At least i see my weights decreasing SLOWLY but hey nothing i can do about it short of stopping eating like FOREVER. haha I dont think i'm disciplined enough to go running at least 1 hr a day on top of all the weights stuff. haha i follow the plan i gots and eat as healthy and goodley as i can and do it slowly!

Reminder to self: Flight back to NZ time has changed to 830pm. Right. i shall remember that.

I was feeling a bit sorry for myself just now but moods lifted which is good :P 

So let me think what else is new?

I'm addicted to watching Heroes / Greys Anatomy / Studio 60 on the sunset strip. Don't judge me . LOL. Heroes is particularly good, maybe its just the geek in my trying to burst out ;)

Trying to save up money for my trip in 5 weeks time and also so i can buy myself my very own laptop which is very cool. However i will be lamenting the non-broadband goodness overseas. Back to dial up i shall be. I'm thinking once i get my laptop i shall be doing much more updating on my travels , although one of the first things i would be doing is to scope out a gym near the flat. LOL. Gyms doesn't seem to be a big thing over in S'pore. Googling ""gyms+singapore"" doesn't really give many options haha. hmm possible money making opportunity? Thing is that most asians are tiny so i guess they dont need the gym :P

Food. Unhealthy food. I need unhealthy food. No i have to be healthy :P I think Salad tomorrow night for dinner and Chilli..mmm Salad and chilli...hmmmm..kinda..hmmmmm

Well i dont know what else to say. Its not really that interesting hehe. Update when theres something interesting."

I've hardly been outside this room in days, 
'cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays. 
The darkness helps until the whiskey wears away, 
And it's then I realize the conscience never fades. 
When you're young you have this image of your life: 
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife. 
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross, 
And if you happen to you wake completely lost. 
But I will fight for you, be sure that 
I will fight until we're the special two once again. 

When we could only need each other, we'd breathe together, 
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's, 
When we were the special two. 
And we could only see each other, we'd breathe together, 
These arms will not be taught to need another, 
'cause we were the special two. 

I remember someone old once said to me: 
""lies will lock you up with truth the only key."" 
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell, 
And couldn't see this place would soon become my hell. 
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face? 
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place. 
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now, 
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not 
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again. 

And we will only need each other, we'll breathe together, 
Our hands will not be taught to need another's, 
When we're the special two. 
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together, 
These arms will not be taught to need another... 

I step outside my mind's eye's for a minute. 
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease, 
Or something that could ease the pain. 
But nothing cures the hurt you bring onto yourself, 
Just remembering, just remembering who we were..."

You and I we were one
And i swore Id stay forever
But they say all good things come to an end- my friend
Now its time to move on
But dont think that this is easy
Cos its hard to be leaving you behind
But you will be fine

[Chorus:]
Oh so if you believe
Say a prayer for me
I wont be here tomorrow
Somewhere I gotta be
Things you want to say
Save them for another day
Cos i can hear the angels calling
Angels calling for me

Does it help if i say
That im really truly sorry
And that I never meant for it to end- this way
Theres a place in your heart 
Where you know you'll always find me
and I'll be with you wherever you are
Near or far

[Chorus x2]

you and I, we were one
And i swore Id stay forever
But they say all good things come to an end - my friend"

Been pretty busy, keeping regular late nites doing various things and that has resulted in me being laid low this weekend.OH NO!!! Could have gone to Christmas in the Park or the Driving Range 2nite but nope in bed sick instead. 

Played squash on wednesday and got my ass whupped by Anna :P Granted she *is* a semi pro player but i did manage to win a first to 15 game by being given a 7 point head start! ha!ha!. We then adjourned to Mission Bay and Movenpick when we decided we didn't want to drive back home in peak hour traffic! Although that totally destroyed the notion of getting some exercise by playing squash in the first place! hah!

Cant remember what I did thursday..its all a blur...but vaguely remember coming home late...or was it my imagination? haha..

Anyways yesterday nite was fun. Firstly dinner at Gengy's at which point i regreetted making my special chilli version as my throat started feeling funny. Ended up in the luxury of the GOLD CLASS VILLAGE CINEMA seats watching the Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe on its last sesson on their very first day!! My god, you really get treated first class. Big-ish leather reclining seats in the 40 seat cinema all to your self. A personal lounge before the movie and then being escorted to the cinema and in a seperate cinema area with a personal bathroom area to boot! Get this, you get your very own CALL BUTTON and WAITER!!!! And all the fabulouso food/drinks that gets served to your chair. Much moving up and down of the chair existed throughout the movie..ahhh...only thing was that the drinks came late (how long does it take to get coke?) and that it become chilly throughout the movie although the time being at 2am it was to be expected i guess. Blankets they should add!! Very excellent experience and should be experienced at least once on special occasions i reakon!. Note if going in a group, an even number should be taken as the chairs are all grouped in 2's so if you have an odd number, it mite be a bit awkward for the odd one out.

The movie was actually not bad. I quite enjoyed it although near the end i was a bit miffed at the ending..now i'm going to go read the books and see whether the book or movie is better and also read the other books in the series.

Woke up 2day with pain PAAAIINN......so hence i'm at home. Slept most of the day which explains the being awake now.although the discovery of old primary school friends and what they're currently doing has made the day VERY novel....much restin needs to be done 2moro in order to be ready for next week. 1st 3 days are already packed with things to do and procrastination of other stuff needs to be added into next week as well!

Had some nice summer malt with the said food and watching the sunset over auckland was something to do at least once! I haven't learnt how to post pictures on LJ or rather i'm too lazy to find out how otherwise i will have pictures to post!

On other news, Unisys contacted me today..they're sending out something soon so i'll have more definite plans for whats happening next year. On the other hand, University departments really do need to save their money (and the environment). Got a letter from the Management and Employment Relations Dept at uni which was a complete surprised seeing i didn't do as well as i could have and also as it was only my 2nd MGMT paper at uni. Gist of the letter was, ""Congrats youre the top 10% of students..blah..blah..blah..APPLY! APPLY TO POSTGRAD MGMT!"" the difference is that they state that i either needed to do 3 stage 3 mgmt papers OR have an average of A in my BCom. Nice gesture but since it isn't my major they really do need to save the paper and ink and postage fee.

Was initially toying with the idea of a trip to CHCH..then that turned to a trip to Singapore but after finding out that i couldnt get the departure date i wanted (in order to return in time for work), that plan turned to 1 week in Sydney. After looking at the horrendous amount accomodation costs in Sydney, i've toned it down to 3 days in Sydney. Look out Sydney!!!!!!!!

Anyways, supposed to organise this thing 2nite..so i'm out."

FINALLY received my final mark for Compsci 335 - A. Better than i expected so i was pleased ANDDDDDD it means that i have not gotten less than an A- for a 3rd year Compsci paper!. So this semester has been rather fruitful with the exception of not being able to finish better by improving my mgmt grade by one itty bitty level. Ah well can't complain when i spent a grand total amount of 1 1/2 days studying for the exam and still managing to get a decent grade!

Anyways the breakdown for those who are bored:

MARKETING 303 A+
COMPSCI 335   A
STATS   330   A-
MGMT 223      B+

And so continues the weird pattern that i seem to do better in my harder papers than my easier papers. Stoked with my marketing grade cos i was bitterly disspointed with my other 2 marketing ones last semester. On other news, i have come to a conclusion that Private Dave S is a much more intelligent guy than i am. I hail to his greatness. Meh..he never reads this anyways :P.. Its been a FABULOUS time back in Auckland..been keeping myself busy catching up with all these people and more to come! Got back from a nite of movenpick ice cream on the beach in mission bay..mm..followed by a round of golfing driving range at nite....cool as.....Sold my iPod and bought the latest iPod Video..MUAHAHAHAHAHA...

So this holiday has been amazing..have thoroughly enjoyed my time doing all sort of stuff but also have some down time which allowed for more than enough time to relax. I wish it wouldn't end cos theres still tons more to do at the Gold Coast!!

Anyways i'm getting tired..because the flight is at 11pm at nite, it means that we negotiated a late check out for 2day but we still got here ridiculously early (5pm). Giving us a 6 hour wait in the airport before we fly off from Australia heading into NZ. One thing ive noticed about customs in Australia is that they NEVER HAVE SMILES on their faces. Honestly not even one tiny glint of a smile on their face. I guess they're paid to do their job but still a tiny smile after you pass all their checks wouldn't hurt. Oh well they're really paranoid about security and who can blame them. This time Dave got stopped funnily enough and it was departing heh heh heh. She looked at me first and then looked at Dave walking behind me and she bypassed me to him. I think it was the fact that i kinda dressed up to look more snazzy 2nite haha..

They did this test on Dave that included taking a piece of paper and swiping it on his hands and pants and then running it through a machine. Probably just to check out whether there are any         e particles. There are some american air force guys ..i hope they're not on the same flight..probably not. They acted a bit     y. Now they're trying Australian outback hats on at a shop..hehe its funny. 

Geez security is tight..i see like the 5th guard to walk pass me for the past 10 minutes and the terminal is quite empty seeing we're nearly the last flight to depart the airport till the early morning local time. Ah well i guess i'll feel safer in that regard.

Went to Dracula's last nite. It was hilarious at some points but at others the joke kinda fell flat on me. The characters were funny as and i would have loved to have a job like that..acitng as crazy as possible and people finding it entertaining and getting paid would be an absolute Hoot! heh heh

The price of the internet at the airport i must say, is SO much more cheaper than the one at the cafe at the Gold Coast. Its $2 for 20 minutes while i paid $2 for 10 minutes at the GC. Still can't wait till its even more cheaper back home but yea i know, having to deal with 56K speeds is no fun at all.. 

Checked my grades and i finally got one back. Good ole Alan. His was the very last exam i sat and its the very first grade that i recieved. UHOH 1 minute left. Anyway to cut the long story short, I got an A-. YAAAY.. Now i need my other 3 grades to come back A- or above and i shall be pleased as apple pie

Gotta run...catch up with all you guys later when i get back!

BYEEE

Its the 2nd full day here and i think we're goign to go shopping at this budget place called HarbourTown..and then hit Pacific Fair..looking to get some cheap goodies. 

I must say that the travelling time from New Zealand to Broadbeach is hideously long but well worth it. 3hrs flight and then 2 hrs train/car to our accomadation which is awesome..100m to the beach AND we still haven't even hit it yet!

Using the internet cafe here and its quite expensive. $2 for every 10 minutes but MY GOD ive been awake at 5-6am EVERY DAY! SO FAR!!!!!!!
2 MINUTES LEFT! AHHH..

So one gripe i have is with the australian customs who singled me out for special questioning because i seemed like a SINGLE MALE, travelling to AUSTRALIA on a MALYASIAN passport on a MUSLIM plane (Brunei Airways)...i was a bit miffed at that but however everyone else has been amazing..

Broadbeach is amazing..
This holiday is amazing..

and we still have tons more to go!!

UHOH 1 minute left!

"event","So i finished my exams....YAY..it felt like an anticlimatic experience seeing that the last exam i had was actually hard but at least its done. Didn't feel right leaving 45 minutes early for that exam but i rechecekd the multichoice answers and the lecturer said that all the ""long"" ans questions could be answered in 2-3 sentences so i didn't see the need to stay in the room any longer. I left my marketing exam early too ..bout 30 minutes and my mgmt exam early..bout 1 hr. Leaving early from exams doesn't feel right most of the time..cos u get ppl staring at you and especially since ure one of the first few to leave, ppl get the impression that you don't know how to do the exam, hence you left early :S. Ah well..i have a good feeling that i passed all my exams..its just the case of how well i did.

Did manage to get my mark for CS335 already. I managed to get 93 or 96 out of 120 for the exam which was both dissapointing and good at the same time. Good because i studied my ass off for it. Bad because it looks like my internal marks will drag my grade down thus ending my run of A's for CS. 

So anyways GRADUATING next year (in the event that the official results come back all positive). Its bittersweet. Happy cos i'm not going to be doing exams, tests, assignments anymore. Sad cos i can't slack off like i have at Uni. hah! you know..the ""eehh lets have a long lunch..class what class.."". Ah that are the good days. Too bad a little thing called 3rd year got in the way of that most of the time for the past 2 years :P.

Hotel Rwanda..AMAZING movie....best ive seen in a long time..not surprising seing its oscar nomintated and all but man did i get sorta teary eyed during the movie (i didn't actually cry).simply an awesome movie Don cheadle and Sophie O did an amazing job and deserved their oscar nominations. Batman Begins was the best batman franchise movie made. I tot it would have been crap but it was actually pretty good. Amityville Horror wasn't that good. but freaked me out a tiny bit. Kingdom of Heavens was confusing and not really even convincing. So watch Hotel Rwanda if you haven't, its great!

Went guy shopping today..cos i needed new clothes..especially summer clothes as i realised that most of my current wardrobe revolved around winter/autumn. Didn't manage to fulfill my goal of buying shorts but i'll get some 2moro or monday or sometime in the weekend. Have decided that most shop assistants are annoying :P but i guess they're just doing their job. You could tell however which ones were actually doing it for the sake of doing their job *cough* hallensteins *cough* and who were actually interested in doing it. Still have store credit at Meccanos due to the suit fiasco and i went brave and i bought a purple tinged shirt *GASP* I KNOW! ME ! IN PURPLE! CAN YOU IMAGINE IT?!?! I COULDN'T!!..Its so strange.my colours have been white/blck/blue/brown/earthy colours and i actually went out and bought a PURPLE coloured shirt?! Heh its my attempt at trying something new. Will be wearing it to Mels 21st so LOOK OUT MEL I'M COMING IN MY NEW PURPLE SHIRT....I'll expect people will either look at it and go ""YUCK"" or go ""INTERESTING"" or go ""THATS NICE""..i'm predicting most will say ""interesting""..hahahahaha.....on the other hand i also spent some more of my workrelated clothing allowance by buying work pants. I kinda rebelled a bit cos when i went into the store and asked for work pants they immediately showed me all the suit type pants and i was like -_- BORING. So i went for a more casual worky look pants which HOPEFULLY will be fine next year. Even if they're not i'm just going to claim them as expenses and use them. heh.cost a pretty penny too i tell you. stupid expensive stores. stupid me for entereing an expensive store. HAH.

Leaving for OZ next wed, 16th. So far everythings going to plan. Be back on the 23rd Sam so will catch up with you after that..should do like a grad dinner nite of some sort just to catch up and all :). Heard stories bout Oz ""Schoolies"" season start on the 19th and everything becomes packed at the GC and all so hopefully we'll hit the theme parks the 1st three days and avoid the huge crowds/queues! mm i wonder whether to get into the clubs/bars that we need to dress up ..anyone whove been to the GC know? :P Have to think about packing clothes for one week soon. In a conindinky conincidence (try saying that 3 times!), i found out that i booked myself into a seminar on the 24th.hehe..and also Harry Potter the Movie is coming out at midnite on the 23rd! and i got 2 tickets to the Megascreen at midnite...Anyone want to go with meeeeeee? Otherwise i'll just go to Berkeley by myself and skip goign all the way to town......heh....going to movies alone is all good. Only high selfmonitors, low selfesteem, low need of cognition and low locus of control people think going alone to movies is bad :P stupid mrkting knowledge still in my head. stupid nerd me still reciting uni material.

Anyways i prob bored everyone sufficiently, so i will say see you guys soon!
I'm thinking of hosting a BBQ at my house but that remains to be seen.heh."

Starting on Monday morning to Wednesday afternoon, each day , i have an exam.

Whats making me extremely stressed is the fact that my marketing exam on tuesday is not looking good. I just can't seem to remember the stuff i read from the txtbook nor my coursebook. I've been through some chpts twice now and i still cant' for the life of me remember what the stuff in there are!!!!! ARGH! and tis the only exam left that has prerequisites for passing ie Have to get 50% of the paper in order to pass regardless of how good your internal is....*sigh*

In other news, 335 was ok..it could have been harder..Mano posted his answers for the exam for his section i had got 80% right for his section so i was pleased considering i only got 50% for his section in the test :S. Hopefully i did round the same for Radu's part but hey i'm so willing to sacrifice marks from 335 just so i can remember my marketing stuff. Its the first paper that ive NEVER missed ONE SINGLE CLASS AND LISTEND AND TOOK NOTES..NOT ONE..i have NEVER done that before!!! And yet its the paper thats causing me my stress right now :(..

I'm prob just being overdramatic at the moment cos its late at nite, i'm tired and frustrated.

ho hum.

Hope everyone else is having good exams! :) and Yay! if you've finished!

I think i'm goign to have one. Very Soon. 

Wasted 1/2 day of study today, finishing marking student assignments. Was surprised at the lack of quality of the assignment seeing that you could virtually obtain full marks if you completed what you were supposed to do. Then again, not surprised as it was due last week (last week of uni) and hence there probably were a lot of assignments due at that time. Still the average is not bad. It took longer than i expected to mark though..thats why i'm panicking cos i wasted 1/2 day of precious studying i could have done. Oh well..2am target for me tonight.

I was supposed to be studying marketing and it didn't help to be reminded of marketing when i checked my mail and i received a letter from the HOD of the Marketing dept inviting me to apply for their post grad programme. Now this letter was dated 12th October...crazy eh..and i recieved it today..the 27th October. Granted i did go see the BCom(Hons) people on last friday..so that means that they wanted to invite me before i even went to talk to them about the possibility of joining the program.

Now people in the ""know"" is probably thinking.What ..THe..Hell..seeing that YES i have signed a contract to start work next year. I'm just merely keeping my options open. At the moment its 80% certain i'm going to start work and not do Honours but i must say that doing postgrad in marketing is quite appealing. Its limited to only 30 places a year too so i'm quite attracted by the small classes and the papers we have to do sounds interesting. Like I.T and Marketing, Entrprenuer Marketing, Special Topic in e-Commerce...and not to mention the fact that its ranked the top dept in the country with all these guest lecturers from the Ivy League universities teaching post grad papers...very..very...appealing......

But i prob wont make my decision till December..so plenty of time to decide my final decision. Still its nice to know that i'm good enough to do honours. Anyways i should stop procrastinating and complete my reading for 335 ( i still have 100 pgs of Mktg reading to do by tonite as well :S). I found out yesterday the ACTUAL questions for my MGMT223 Exam as they use the same question every semester for the topics they tell us is in the exam (YES!) and that i got 40.5/50 for my internal. Which means that i jsut need to get 9.5 marks out of 60 for the final exam to get 50/100. Which should get me a C- at least. Which theorectically means i just need to go in, do one essay to get 10/20 and then i can walk out and still pass the paper. Tempting :P.. but do i want another C- on my degree? (ones enough i reakon :P).

ARGH..study.."

"event","Last night was the most exciting election ever!

It had everything, a come from behind win to a plane threatening to crash into the sky tower!!!

Labour is currently leading by 1.1% with special votes to come still. General consensus is that special votes do not change the results much (if any) at all and the Greens seem to be the only party that benefits from them as a lot of the special votes are students both overseas and out of their electorate yesterday.

So YAY for democracy and YAY for the 40.7% + 5.07% + 1.21% + 2% of voters who has help take a HUGE step into securing the better next 3 years for NZ.

I was watching the news coverage and what was apparent is people everywhere is split. A woman was interviewed sayign that she was coming down to vote to cancel out what her husband was going to vote. I think this election has been increasingly divisive. I'm glad its over and I think Don Brash is rather optimistic thinking he will still be able to form a govt. But then again i'm not surprised seeing that he and his party have run an election campaign based on divisive-ness and by continuing on this vein, demonstrates his continued attempt to create more divisions. Its funny how this election mirrors the George Bush vs Al Gore...this time being the right winner won (how ironic :P). But the healing must start now. People need to be brought together. I mean , u see Urban NZ going strongly Labour but provincial NZ going National."

"event","Its a funny time elections...thank god it only comes once in 3 years..

This year is proving to be one of the closest contest in yonks and i'm feeling pretty staunch about using my vote to keep National out of government. I tot i'd list my reasons why i'm voting for Helen Clark and Labour.

1. Race Divisions

Political parties that pits different races together in order to get into government is not someone i'll support. ""One Law for all"" . Yea right. Thats a pretty good ideal notion to have in your mind but its NEVER going to happen. Its like saying ""i want world peace"" yea right. Getting rid of the maori seats WITHOUT consultation with the proper parties is going to start a Civil war in New Zealand. Maori and European relationships will head down into the gutter and i can predict that New Zealand will probably become the Zimbabwe of the pacific. Look at the Khmer Rouge, their policy was equality. Everyone under the same law and under same conditions. Yes that works so well! How is it constructive to use race relations as a political tool. Pauline Hanson used it in Australia, Winston in New Zealand and now Don Brash as well. Not some people i want to be associated with. 

2. Tax vs Student Loans

I will admit, i have a rather large student loan. I will save $42,000 under Labour. Under National, i get less than $10 A WEEK under my pay rate. In fact 80% of people will get less than $10 a week under National's tax plan. Wohoo i can go out and buy umm a $5 burger! Now there are people who are working 2 jobs and earning round $25,000 a year. They dont benefit at all under Nationals Tax plan and even if they do its still in the single figures! How come they will still STRUGGLE to make ends meet while Mr ""I'll sit on my ass all day"" Don Brash gets an extra $96 per week? Recent information puts the treasury plans for student loans costing at the worst case scenario at $5 billion. National ppl have said that its economically unsafe. What hypocrites! National is spending $7 billion more on their taxes and in addition, they would have to BORROW (i'm not saying Labour wont have to borrow, i doubt they will but maybe). Its quite common sense people. If youre going to lower taxes, get rid of the Petrol tax and promise all these extra stuff, the figures DONT ADD UP! ESSENTIAL Services like HEALTH and EDUCATION will SUFFER! Yes National states that they will not decrease spending on those two. However do they take into account that the population is aging, resulting in a higher need for extra care? Work health issues are increasing , putting more strain on the health system. The population is GROWING, meaning more ppl will need care. YOU NEED TO INCREASE SPENDING ON HEALTH WITH THE INCREASE IN POPULATION, not keep it the same! You want to know how they will find the money, selling Kiwi Bank, sellign NZ Post, selling Air NZ..goodbye national identity! Hello foreign country just called New Zealand!

3. Moral Policy

Any party that thinks being gay is a disease will not get my vote. Enough said.

4. Nuclear Policy

Gone by lunchtime. Enough said

5. Working For Families.

This is a GOOD program. It helps people who needs it the most! i agree. Why help someone who can afford to buy cristal like *snap*? HELP those who need HELP MOST! National will do away with this scheme to help pay for their tax cuts...helping those who are richer more than those who need it most.

6. Leadership

Someone who has a total of 3 years political experience is capable of leading New Zealand? Is Someone whos afraid to raise their voice against a female capable of forcing issues with say Condelezza Rice of the U.S? Is someone who can't even remember his policies or know about his policy capable of being a competent prime minister? Yea Right Don Brash! I have to admit, both Helen and Don have lied. They're both politicians. But i will say i will sleep safely in my bed knowing that Helen clark will stand up to unfair wars like Iraq and that she will be able to handle emergencies competently. 

So that is my rant on the elections. You may hate it but i'm not posting this to make friends. This is the way i see it and that is why Red is the way to go on Saturday the 17th."

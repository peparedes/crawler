I apologize ahead of time if these pictures belong to someone in this community.  I'm not claiming them as my own, I'm just gushing over their adorable-ness.

"event","OK, just a thought... watching Season 3 of Buffy, and it just occurred to me that after Mrs. Post, it was said that Faith would remain under Giles' watch until a watcher could be found for her.  Then, way down the road, Giles gets fired and almost immediately Wesley pops into Sunnydale.  Why didn't the council assign Wesley to Faith when Mrs. Post was killed?  I mean, we all know that Giles definitely focused his attention on Buffy, maybe Faith would've turned out better is she had a watcher of her very own.  Of course, the series wouldn't have been as interesting but....

I dunno, just thinking..."

"event","OK, let's talk about my day.

Woke up early, train out to city, got to Equinox on time.  Andres texts me, tells me he won't be coming in until about 4:00.  Great, so I get to sit around the gym with snobby gym peoples for five hours by myself.  Well, before I even get in there, I see Marla walking down the street.  Turns out she works in the area.  So, I get in, set up, and... sit.  And sit, and sit, and sit.  I smile, greet customers, talk to a few of them about the products, but mostly just sit.  Then, one guy is leaving, so I give him a big smile and say, ""Have a nice day,"" when he suddenly yells, ""THAT'S SO COOL!""  I'm wondering what the hell he's talking about... and he points at my tattoos.  So we talk for a while, about high school and college and what I was doing there, etc, etc.  Totally obvious he's hitting on me.  So before he leaves he gets my phone number, then when I go to shake his hand, he kisses mine!  What kind of guy does that?!  He's probably totally a player, but still, it was nice to be flirted with.  So, I'm sitting, sitting, sitting again, and this girl comes in.  She's selling make-up, and it's actually a good deal.  I got blush, eyeshadow, powder, lip gloss, and those oil blotting sheets for $20!  I usually spend that much on one pot of eyeshadow!  So, sitting, sitting, sitting.  Ate some split pea soup, yum yum.  Sitting, sitting, when all of a sudden one of the sales associates comes over with a customer and is like, ""She's interested in a wide belt..."" but, apparently it's too wide.  So I show her the double-wrap, and lo and behold!  A sale!  *Dances* It was great to finally make a sale, after spending Thursday and Friday in that place.  Andres finally showed up around 5:00 to relieve me, he even paid for my dinner!  But then... there was the commute.  I.  Hate.  Tourists.  Seriously, why do they have to stop in the middle of the friggin' sidewalk to take a picture of some damn buildings?!  And then they walk hand-in-hand, taking up the whole sidewalk so that you can't even scoot around them.  Or, they weave back and forth, always getting in your way.  Needles to say, a trip that should have taken me less than 20 minutes took more than twice that.  So, I missed the 5:51 train and took the 6:27 one instead.  Which is ok, 'cause that one is usually less crowded.  So, on the ride home, I was reading <u>New Moon</u> again (shut up), while also thinking about the recent Justin drama, when I realized that Jake makes me happy, too.  Jake from <u>New Moon</u>, not code-name Jake.
So, home now, might work on some homework, then bed.
PEACE!"

"event","OK, so I'm sitting here watching <i>Marley and Me</i>, and in the spirit of pet ownership, I decided to let the ferrets out.  So, what happens?

Luke manages to steal the remote to my TV and puts the movie on mute.  Apparently, I wasn't paying enough attention to him.
When I chased him under the bed to get my remote back, I discovered that he managed to get a hold of a roll of toilet paper and had it all over the place.  Just to rub it in my face, he gathered up a bunch of it in his front paws and scooted backwards, pulling more off the roll.
Just at the end, when I'm crying hysterically, Luke, in a burst of energy, runs over the DVD player remote, causing the movie to go back to the main menu.

I swear that Luke is Marley reincarnated."

Or, dreams where people who haven't been in my life for years and years suddenly pop up and act like nothing is wrong.  It's starting to get really disturbing.  Last night, I guess the last episode of House was playing over and over again, and I had a dream that the next episode of House was using the same lines, only different things were happening.  And in my dream, I was confused as to why the writers would use the same dialogue in two episodes that were so close together."

"event","OK, so, even though I hate Valentine's Day, today was pretty cool.  Woke up in Chase's bed at 11:00, drove home.  Drank some coffee, worked on my homework.  Went to work, got there just in time to not have to do the Valentine's Day party.  Got to play with Kristen's dog and daughter, her daughter is so cute!  And then Ginny brought me a Valentine's Day card!  It's one of those musical cards, and it plays High School Musical!!!  YAY!!!!!!!  Anyway, for some reason I had a serious backache, so I texted Tina and Ginny and had them bring me Vicodin and muscle relaxers.  I miss my Vicodin highs, they're so nice.  Like Pink says, ""I'm safe up high, nothing can touch me.""  *Sigh* I need more.  Anyway, saw Jah-Vah and Clutch tonight.  Got three cups of coffee!

"event","I finally figured out what it's like to be in my head; what it's like to deal with people the way I do.

So, pretend you're throwing a party with your buddy, and something funny happens, right?  So every time someone walks in the door, your buddy is like, ""Oh man, tell them what happened!""  So you tell the story, and then the next person comes in, and you tell the story again.  After a while, you get so sick of telling the story, but you endure and tell it over and over.  Finally, you just get so fed up that you want to scream and cry and tell everyone to fuck off, and eventually you just go hide in a room somewhere just so you don't have to deal with all the people and go through the fucking story again.

That's exactly like my life.  I'm so sick and tired of going through the motions of talking to people that I want to go hide in a room somewhere, in the dark, by myself."

"event","Hahahaha, lets see what drugs I've taken since I woke up at 10:00 AM.

Finacea (sp?) gel for my face
Yaz for PMDD (which did not help at all)
Prozac
Xanax

And the days not over!  I think it's fuckin' hysterical how I have to pump my body full of all this crap just to survive day by day.  Sure, some of it's unnecessary, like the Finacea and the Yaz, but it's still part of my prescriptions.  Then there's the cocktail of vitamins I take every day.  I wonder how much of my body is natural and how much is chemical at this point.

OK, well, enough of my amusing rant.  Gotta go pretend I want to go to work.

PEACE!"

"event","I feel like I'm going crazy... crazy-er, I guess.  I dunno, for some reason I was so intent on getting off the train today.  I was so twitchy, I kept bouncing my leg and staring out the window.  I swear, if I could stick my head out the window, I would have.  I just wanted to get home.  Actually, first I wanted to smoke a cigarette, then I wanted to drink a Slurpee, then I wanted to go home.  And when I got home, I felt the need to wash my face really well, like scrubbing it.  I dunno, I just felt wrong, like everything was put together wrong.  And I can't concentrate on the TV, I can't concentrate on my reading, I can't think.  I took a Xanax to help me calm down, but I had already been at home for a while.  The positive part is that I'm not going crazy, or seeing things, or really tired... well, really tired considering that I've been up since 4:30 AM.  Normal tired.

Anyway, I gotta finish this reading for school tomorrow, even though I don't want to.

G'night, all."

"event","Wow, it's been years.  Or months.  Maybe weeks.  Does anyone even read this anymore?  I'm sitting in class right now, waiting for the teacher to finish with some other students before I can ask her some questions.  Only four more weeks of school.  Less, actually, more like three and a half.  I can make it.
I've been cutting down my hours at Petco.  I just can't deal with customer service or anything right now.  I  want to kill everyone who talks to me, including the employees.  Or, most of them.  Denise is pissed that I'm cutting my hours, but at this point it's either that or quitting.  This quarter is really tough, but as soon as I'm done I can go back to my normal work schedule.  It's not going to be easy, since I'll be making less money, but it's only for a few weeks.  I still have enough money left over from my taxes to act as a cushion until I go back to full time.  Plus, on my week off, hopefully I'll feel well enough to work some overtime.

So, let's see.  What's left for school?

-Create pattern for final dress
-Create pattern for practice jacket
-Cut out half-jacket in muslin
-Cut out half-dress in muslin
-Cut ouf practice jacket in muslin
-Sew muslin practice jacket
-Sew final jacket
-Sew final dress
-Finish sewing final pant
-Start working on final sketching project
-Start working on final intro to manugacturing project

Oy, that's a lot.  One thing at a time, though.  I need to calm down, need to breathe.  Can't stress, mind will snap.  I need a vacation, one where I can just sit in my room or something.  I took a three hour nap yesterday and woke up exhausted.  I can't believe I fell asleep.  I was just sitting there waiting for my nail polish to dry so that I could get some cleaning done, and I just passed out.  I also wanted to work on some more homework, but that obviously didn't work out.

When I get home today, I have to go to the library and pick up <u>Prozac Nation</u>.  I had to have it transfered from another library.  No one had the book or the movie.  My mom made me watch the movie; it's so scary how much I am like that.  I would never pull a stunt like she did with Texas, but that's because I'm broke.  But everything else, the paranoia, the depression, the thoughts and feelings are all the same.

OK, well, I should get back to school.  Another three hours in this class, ugh.  I need another cup of coffee."

<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Judgment is related to the Hebrew letter Shin, which is fiery and spiritual. A break from the past, going forward.</font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">With Fire as its ruling element, Judgement is about rebirth or ressurection. The idea of Judgement day is that the dead rise, their sins are forgiven, and they move onto heaven. The Judgement card is similar, it asks the resurrection to summon the past, forgive it, and let it go. There are wounds from the past that we never let heal, sins we've committed that we refuse to forgive, bad habits we haven't the courage to lose. Judgement advises us to finally face these, recognize that the past is past, and put them to rest, absolutely and irrevocably. This is also a card of healing, quite literally from an accident or illness, as well as a card signaling great transformation, renewal, change.</font></p>

"event","I just copied a post that I put up on my ferret communities, so if it looks like I'm talking to strangers, it's because I originally was.

Squishy passed away this morning.

The vet called me around 10:30 to update me.  Said he was doing fine, he was eating, awake, etc.  Then he called back about an hour/an hour and a half later to say that he had passed away.  I was out shopping at the time, so my mom called me to let me know.  When I spoke to the vet, he said that Squishy was really quiet this morning, and he just passed in his sleep.  Possibly from complications from surgery.  But I know that's not it.

He thought I left him.  He had been in two homes before he came to me, and he thought he was being left again.  He'd never been away from home for that long.  He was there two nights, and even with his other gland, he was only gone a night.  When I didn't pick him up the second day, he just decided to give up.  He didn't think I was coming back.

After I got the phone call, I called my boyfriend to come pick me up, and we drove out to get him.  They had him all taped up in a little cardboard coffin.  We drove out to a pet cemetary that does cremations.  Before handing him over, though, I had to take one last look at him.  I had my boyfriend open the box first, then when he told me he didn't look too bad, I looked in on him.  He didn't look peaceful, like he just fell asleep.  He looked dead.  Like he died a miserable, lonely death.  I just pet his head, and told him that I came back for him, and that I'll miss him.

I'm picking up his ashes tomorrow."

I've had the shittiest couple of days EVER.  Yesterday, I woke up early to drop Squish off at the vet for his ultrasoung.  Went to my own doctor, then went shopping.  Come home to get a letter from Ai saying that I failed a course.  I go and check everything out, and it turns out that I failed the class that I missed the last day of.  I had spoken to the teacher beforehand, and told her everything that had happened, and she said no big deal.  So I e-mailed her again to find out what happened.  After that, I go to pick up Squish, only to find out that he's going to have to have surgery done... in Plainview.  Almost an hour away.  Also, he has earmites.  Great.  Get home, no reply from my teacher.  Family's over, Jessie comes over, then we leave to go watch Sweeney Todd.  And, of course, after driving out to Island 16, it's sold out.  By this time I'm really cranky.  Failed a class, gotta drive to Plainview, and I can't even see the movie I've been dying to see.  Go to a diner, order a Long Island Iced Tea.  Get home, pass out.  Wake up, play video games, drink coffee.  Get an e-mail from my teacher saying that because I didn't hand in my final project, I failed.  Which is bullshit, 'cause when I missed the class, I had e-mailed her saying that I left the project in the cabinet in school and she said she would check in the following Friday.  So I started crying, and my mom called the school.  We spoke to my admissions counselor, who said to speak to the department head.  So we have to wait for her to call us back to find out what's going on.  I have gotten all A's in all of my other classes, and in all of the projects I handed in for this class.  I absolutely refuse to take the class again, just because of one final project that I did, in fact, hand in.

I really need to get fuckin' drunk."

"event","I'm in computer class right now, listening to the Loudmouth Trio prattle on about nothing at all.  Of course, I got stuck sitting next to the biggest of the Loudmouths.  At least all my homework is done.  Now I can focus on important things like posting on my LiveJournal and MySpace.

So, yesterday I was on my way to school when I realized that I had forgotten my monthly train ticket.  I decided I would just buy another ticket, but then I realized that I also left my school I.D. at home, too.  So I had to turn all the way around and head home, and I realized that I would miss the 10:33 train, and have to take the 11:33 train, which would probably make me late.  The 11:33 train didn't get into Penn until 1:08, and I had to be to class at 1:15.

So, I get to the school at 1:26.  I'm pissed off at myself, because I haven't been late to a class yet, and I didn't want to start now.  When I walked in, however, the teacher wasn't even there yet!  Apparently, she wasn't going to be there until at least 1:45, maybe even later!  I was so happy to hear that.

Thank gods Thanksgiving break is coming up soon.  It's not even a real ""break.""  I don't have class on Thursday, but I'm probably going into Petco to take care of the animals.  And I don't have class on Friday, but I still have work.  Ugh, Black Friday,

I have an interview at Justice tomorrow at 4:00.  I don't know if they're looking to hire a part time third key, but I'll at least go down and check everything out.  Hopefully they can offer more than Limited Too.  And at least as much as Petco.  I so need to get out of there, I was talking with Susan and Rachel about how much Denise sucks.  She plays favourites, and doesn't discipline at all.  It's ridiculous, and unless you're on her favourites list (which consists of ""her boys"" and Tara), you're not going to get anywhere in that company.  I don't even understand why she likes ""her boys"" so much, all they do is make a friggin' mess, and leave it for everyone else to clean up.  Grrr, that place makes me so aggravated.

Alright, I'm leaving in about twenty minutes.  I'm going to head to the Mid-Manhattan Library and get a new book.  Or maybe I'll hold on to Memoirs Of A Geisha and read it over again.  Save myself a trip.  Yeah, I think I'll do that.

Alright, enough babbling for me.  Peace."

"event","Well, I'm at school right now.  I'm in my computer applications class, and I've finished the homework for the rest of the year (which is another month classes).  I've gotten all of my midterm grades back, and... *drumroll please* all A's!  So far, I have a 4.0 GPA.  I've never had a 4.0 GPA before!  My mom made a good point, though, this is something I like, so I'll be doing better because of it.

On a side note, Petco is really starting to suck now.  Denise is really getting on my ass about my school schedule, and I'm getting sick of it.  I now have another, more important, obligation in my life.  Sucks for her, but Petco is going to have to come second.  Or third or fourth, depending on what else is going on.  When I told her that I need Saturday mornings so that I could work on classwork during the evening, she basically said, ""That means nothing to me, you should have open availability since you're a lead.""  Then I pointed out that Joey doesn't have open availability either, and she didn't want to hear anything about that.  Talk about playing favorites.  Either way, I'm starting to look for employment elsewhere, which should come quite easily considering Christmas is coming.  I want to get a job in Tanger somewhere.  I figure that if I'm going to school for Fashion Design, I should have some experience in the fashion business, even if it is just folding t-shirts.  Aeropastale is hiring right now, they're looking for leads, and starting pay is $15 an hour.  More than I will ever make at Petco.  That's another thing that pisses me off, Denise said she didn't want to do my review because I'm being lazy at work.  BULLSHIT!  I have school four days a week, and I have to cut my hours down to 32 exactly.  That's why I can't get as much done as usual.  Besides, why should I continue to work my ass off for a company that doesn't appreciate anything I've ever done for them?  No, it's not  happening.

Alright, I'm going to work on my Fashion History homework now.  Peace out, people."

"event","OK, so I brought Squishy to the vet.  I also brought Erick, 'cause he sounded kind of congested.

So, the vet said that Squishy's having an allergic reaction to something.  So today I'm going to toss out their food and buy the food I used to buy, to see if that's what it is.  I used to feed them Eight In One Ultimate, and recently switched them to Zupreem, so that may be it.  Or, it may be my new laundry detergent.  We'll see.  He also gave me some anti-biotics to give him to help clear up the skin.  I also have to make some duck soup for his diarrhea.

As for Erick, he said he was fine.  He couldn't hear any congested-ness when he was there, so he said it was probably humidity build up.  I have to keep an eye on him, make sure he's not acting differently."

"event","So, my birthday.

<u>Thursday, June 7th:</u>
Brought my car in to fix the windshield.  Hung around Jessie's house for a while.  Dave & Buster's at 8:30.
Met up with Nessa, and two of her friends.  Then Crystal came by.  Then we realized that we'd been sitting outside for some time, and no one else had shown up.  So we called Melissa, and she thought it was Friday.  Argued with her for a while, until she agreed to come out that night.  Went in, ate and drank.  Only we found out later that they stopped doing 1/2 price drinks.  We were pissed.  Played games, drank, had fun.  Nessa went to by me a drink, and it turns out that some guy sitting next to us paid for it.  Yay for free drinks.  That's about it.

<u>Friday, June 8th:</u>
Went home after staying at Jessie's, showered, changed.  I think I looked really cute that day.  I was wearing black capris, a white t-shirt with an empire waist, hood, and skull print, a black wifebeater with studs around the neckline under that, and my pretty new wedges.  Went back to Jessie's hung around.  Called some people to invite them over.  Then, as it turns out, no one decided that they were coming.  So I sat in Jessie's camper and cried, 'cause really, what friends I have that they don't want to see me on my birthday.  Eventually Jessie and I decided to go to Target, 'cause Target usually makes me happy.  While we were there, I got a call from Melissa and Anthony, and they decided to come and hang out.  So we stocked up on food and went back to the house.  I grabbed the bottle of Jack out of my car that Crystal had given me the night before (it was only flask-sized, so it wasn't much), and started drinking.  Then they called Courtney and convinced her to come and hang out.  So we sat around the fire and had hot dogs and drank and talked, then Jessie went to sleep.  Then Anthony left.  And the three of us (me, Courtney, and Melissa) were left outside.  We stayed up until 5:00 AM, and until I finished the bottle of Jack (I'm still proud, even if it was tiny).

<u>Saturday, June 9th:</u>
Woke up around 10:30 AM with major cramps.  Made Jessie get up and shower so I could go home and take some Midol or something.  I also made him drive, 'cause I was still drunk from the night before.  Got home, showered, and walked over to the local deli for coffee and food.  Let me tell you, they suck.  Went back, ate, then decided to go shop in Mastic before my family came over.  Bought a nice shirt and some really nice pants at Mandee's, then went to Kohls to shop for Jessie.  Then we had to head back to my house.  Had dinner, watched TV, had dessert.  All that fun stuff.  Then we took Kevin to the mall, where the two of them busted my chops the entire time.  Although we did pick up a Game Cube and Baten Kaitos Origins for me, and Jessie also found Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean (which I'm playing right now - I stole it from him and he hasn't noticed yet.  Hahahahah!).  Came back, played games, fell asleep.

<u>Sunday, June 10th:</u>
Woke up early, showered, got dressed.  I had a really cute outfit on Sunday, too.  A white wifebeater under a black t-shirt with princess sleeves, a denim skirt that I made out of a pair of pants, with a patch on it with a skull with a pink bow tie, and my flats.  I thought I looked good, Jessie made fun of me.  He says my flats are ballerina shoes.  So, we went to the city, and the entire train ride there I wanted to kill Kevin and Jessie.  When we finally got there, we went to Planet Hollywood, only to find out the main floor was closed off for some event.  I said a celebrity was probably coming, but we never really found out.  So we ordered food, and I ordered this awesome drink called The Comet.  It was pretty strong.  And I got to keep the glass.  So after food, we went to see Rent.  I was excited, 'cause it was Jessie's first Broadway play.  Of course, her was expecting it to be exactly like the movie, and it wasn't.  So he wasn't happy about that.  I loved it, though.  Everyone was so great (except for Roger, he was a bit... scary).  Play ended, came home.

<u>Monday, June 11th:</u>
Camping!  Not much to say.  Set up camp, went to sleep.

<u>Tuesday, June 12th:</u>
Went in the water and walked on the beach all day.  Went up to the lighthouse and saw it all boarded up.  Hung out with the piping plovers.  Got attacked by raccoons at night (not really, but they did come really close to the campsite).

<u>Wednesday, June 13th:</u>
Walked around the woods and stuff, that was fun.  But when we tried to go to Gosman's they were closed.  That made me really upset.  So we went back to camp and hung around there.  I called work to find out when I was next scheduled, and also found out that Heidi and Dan both walked out.  Went to bed.

<u>Thursday, June 14th:</u>
Packed up, went home.  It was so nice to shower.  Went back to Jessie's and hung out there for a while.  Definitely not happy about vacation being over, but it was time.

All in all, good week.  I guess."

Kelly Clarkson


I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did,
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Because of you
Because of you</center></lj-cut>"

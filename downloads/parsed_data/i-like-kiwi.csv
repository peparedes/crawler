"event","summer has been awesome. lately, ive been trying to soak up every last second of being with my sister before she leaves on the 15th for italy till december. im gonna miss her like hell. Its awesome that Shannon and my sister are hitting it off as well as they are. Steph seems to want to hang out with her as much i as do lol. o well. no harm in that. im getting ready to miss people tho. this summer has been quite a rollercoster of relationships...i've had my share of 'flings' but in each i have always had the thought of ""summer will end soon and they will leave..."" so i've been telling myself that. but from this entire summer i have gained strenth in my constants. Jordan...its amazing to me that after 2 years of be living here that you and i are stronger than ever. i love you so much and it just shows how much we mean to each other. We will always have each other. Shannon, its so awesome that we can hang out as much as we do and not once have i gotten sick of you. we always have so much fun together.(himalayaaaaaaaa) i love it. you both mean the world to me. thanx for everything.

Late at night your no sleeping

i feel sick.

Well you're just across the street
Looks a mile to my feet
I want to go to you
Funny how I'm nervous still
I've always been the easy kill
I guess I always will

Could it be that everything goes around by chance (chance)
Only one way that was always meant to be (be)
You kill me, you always know the perfect thing to say (heeey, and...)
I know what I should do but I just can't walk away

I can picture your face well
From the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go to you
I'll pick up, put down the phone
Like your favorite Heatmiser song goes
'It's just like being alone'

Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain (vain)
I need answers to what all the waiting I've done means (means)
You kill me, You've got some nerve, I can't face your mistakes (heeey, heeey)
I know what I should do but I just can't turn away

So go on love
Leave while theres still hope for escape
Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead
So much regrett
I know what you want to say
(Know what you want to say)
I know it but cant help feel indifferently
I loved you, and I should have said it
but tell me, just what has it ever meant?

I can't help it baby, this is who I am (am)
Sorry but I can't just go turn off how I feel (feel)
You kill me, You build me up, but just to watch me break (Heeey, heeey)I know what I should do but I just can't walk away"

it went well, the worst part was the injections, that hurt like a bitch ::tear::

but its all good, afterwords...i came home, took my pills then passed out. 

i woke up around 2 and right in front of me was my amazing boyfriend. He was giggleing with my sister and he was holding this litle labrador stuffed animal. Its one of the softest things i have ever touched. He is so good to me, of course i looked like crap cause i just woke up and i am under drugs lol

Its times like these, when we have no power to make any efforts to see others, that we see just who cares about you and who doesnt. Who is a friend because of your abilites or who honestly loves you. Even friends that dont have a license find a way to see you somehow. Shan, your awsome. I've received many calls and Chris, Danny and Shan came to see me. The dont know how much that meant to me. Granted i was alittle out of it when that all happened, but its things liek this that i will never forget. Thanx you guys.

so now im just chilling, i have no strength due to my meds right now. so looks like i am not gonna be running any marathons. if you wanna talk, ill be here.

Alot of the things that my moving away put into the shadows came out and at times it was hard to talk about cause i had no control and in no way woud i have done anything to hurt her on purpose. <BR>I guess its natural to be forced to ""move on"". It'll always hurt. I dont know why we are made for pain sometimes but all i know now is our friendship is the strongest its ever been.

Your positive traits: 

Your lively, outgoing attitude attracts people to you everywhere you go.
You can talk your way into - and out of - any situation you desire.
You're adaptable enough to flirt with anyone - and people tend to fight over you. 

Your negative traits: 

You get easily bored in relationships, and tend to jump from person to person.
You tend to be a bit of a player - and have a high tolerance for drama in relationships.
Not the most emphathetic person, you tend to tell lovers to ""get over"" their problems. 

Your ideal partner: 

Is intelligent and quick witted enough to keep you interested.
Is a bit of a shape shifter, providing you with the variety you crave.
An open minded person, who's willling to have a non-traditional relationship. 

Your dating style: 

Exciting. If your date shows you a new experience (like Egyptian food or scuba diving), you're very happy. 

Your seduction style: 

Experimental: it's rare that you try the same thing twice.
Ultra kinky - you do stuff that's not even in books yet.
Hot and cold... sometimes you're just not into the whole sex thing. 

Tips for the future: 

Settle down a little. Sometimes good things come with time - so don't let people go so fast.
Acknowledge that you're a player and flirt. If your mate can't live with this, find someone who can.
Give your partner a little more attention. You don't have to be a social butterfly all the time. 

Best place to meet someone online: 

Match.com - enough sexy singles for you to find a new playmate when you get restless 

Best color to attract mate: Sunny yellow 

Best day for a date: Wednesday"

"event","ya know. friendships are weird. there is just so much giving and taking that sometimes people lose that line to where it shows to much is too much. friends are such a big part of our lives. i mean when i look back at my life, i think i would be nothing without those best friends that have come and unfortunately gone, i try to stay positive. i was so comfortable in vegas. i felt liek everything was stable. gonna grad with my best friends from kindergarden, gonna be that lifer that i always dreamed of way back in first grade. i had jord and i had liz and i had Jeff. everything was great. then i was torn apart. as this school year comes to a close, i looked at what i had. and i still have Jord, i still have Liz and Jeff is still by my side. the only thing differnt is i have more people that i dont think i could life without. im the new kid. i understand that. there is no way i can compete with people you have known since forever.love is love. if u want me to back off i will. just be honest. please"

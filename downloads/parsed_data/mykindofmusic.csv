"event","Quick post real quick to remind people here that Xanga annoys me to NO end. I just found out a girl has been taking all my icons and posting them in her journal.

This is my graphics journal, and I don't like having my stuff hotlinked-therefore this journal is Friends Only.

Please check out my userinfo for rules :]"

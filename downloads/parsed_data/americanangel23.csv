ITS TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
believe the rumors
shes a bitch
and she over reacts to EVERYTHING
i went on the roof today to get some sun (YESS i KNOW its stupid ok i get it ok ok ok) and i was with other ppl but since im a prefect its ALL MY FAULT.
MY FUCKING FAULT.
i had to sit there and 'apologize' to everyone for endangering their lives supposedly... as if i forced them up there or something... THEY CAME ON THEIR OWN i didnt force anyone to do anything... UGH this is soo stupid
she says she and the other teacher she talked to want to give us a restriction, but she hasnt ""decided"" yet i guess so WHO FUCKING KNOWS.. 
im suspended from being a prefect for 2 weeks... which isnt so bad.. less responsibility i guess.. more time to do homework... i just need to find someone to take my place for the time being... haha sucks for that person.
ok well i have a shitload of hw to do and considering ive been being lectured for the whole study hall i should get working if i want to get any sleep tonight."

woke up at nine and a few of us made a big YUMMy breakfast and watched movies...i stayed in my pajama's basically all day.. which i guess wasnt the best idea because one must consider the motherfucking FIRE ALARM. it went off about 5 times AT LEAST because some DUMBASSES were burning a cake up in the lounge, supposedly they threw it out the window... WHY some one would do that? i really dont know, but that was annoying.
hmmmmm BLAH.
we had a really annoying prefect meeting that took up all of first half tonight.. GOD i wanted to strangle mrs moore and ms susi... and had little-miss (err well actually quite BIG) madame marquis been there, i KNOW i would have hit her or something. shes just such a bitch. even if were just minding our own business doing nothing, she feels like yelling at us is the best way to make us do whatever she wants... apparantly she doesnt like teenagers.. so at this point, one asks--- THEN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU WORKING AT A  H-I-G-H  S-C-H-O-O-L  ?!?!?!?!?!??
mr kelley is now the OFFICIAL headmaster, no longer just temperary.. which is awful. hes such a sap. ""we are a community... BLAH BLAH BLAH *tear* *sob* blah."" how touching.
ashley and lami came in at break and raped each other. it was quite the entertainment if u know what i mean.. ;-)

Seriously, Megan probably won't be comming back...but I still hope so. I'm packing out my house...tomorrow the packers come, so i've been having to ""organize"" and what was once what i liked to refer to as MY BEDROOM is now an empty room with a desk and bed. Grace is being a bitch...I can't see Jessica this summer...Lost a lot of contacts in Virginia...I dispise Texas with a passion....and yah! In January I get to see Hailey again because meeting up with her in Virginia is now looking ever so doubtful due to our lack of communication. THe computer is being taken apart tomorrow!! So how to access interent...i guess the embassy is my only option. The only slightly interesting part of Virginia is probably meeting up with Benner, thats cuz i heard she went from bein' all goth and bi to that same old Christian girl from the 6th grade. I don't believe it and have to see it with my own eyes man! Went to a motor cross thing 2 hours out of town last night. It was okay...kinda boring...lots and lots of sun....i'm kinda burned but more tanned then burned. YIPPY! Met some people...sadly they had already heard of me from Franner! GOD! I explained he was an X and that I have NO ASSOCIATION with him what so ever. The other day when i was with Hanna i think it was....i might a girl named Eleanor...but more well known as eleanwhore. She was like wait are you ""THE LAUREN""...i was like uhh yes my name is Lauren. She was like ""THE LAUREN?? THE AMERICAN LAUREN!?"" I got kinda pissed I was like yes as i've already told you MY NAME IS LAUREN and if you cannot tell because i don't have ur kok accent I am AMERICAN! Apparently she went to St. Pauls and heard of me there....I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYONE IN ST. PAULS BESIDES CHRISTOPH and it's not like he has people to talk to there! God! Then I was talking to Marcel and he was like and you know so and so...blah blah blah. I was like no i don't know him...apparently everyone has met me but I've never met them. It's really irritating...and the only possible explanation I can think of is Dian and Franner (Francois)! That ass! Well there's nothing that i am happy about. Hanna leaves in like 2 days....but it's okay cuz I'ma get to see her in Finland thats a given.

SZYMON COME BACK TO SCHOOL!!
YOU BETTER!!
CUZ I MISS YOU, IT'S NOT THE SAME WITHOUT U!!
AND UHH...YAH
GET ON MSN SOON!!
Szymon got in shit cuz there were people from the school over at his house, and his mom wasn't there. And his parents and him had to sign an agreement to not let people from the school over there. And i think like there was a noise complaint so the cops came. Somehow the school found out. Moody was there, and Marek had his girlfriend from the school over there too or something. So since Szymon's other brothers have asked to be withdrawn they're afraid szymon might be a ""bad egg"" or something. BUT HE'S NOT, HE'S A GOOD PERSON! And so...they have to wait till Szymon's mother gets back from gstaad or something until Szymon can come back. But i think the school knows that Szymon's a good person, cuz like if you look at his grades you can tell that he tries. And i know mr. mcavoy put in a good word for him that i know. So i think he'll be aloud to come back. Melissa told me he was expelled which was a load of shit! She gave off the impression she was happy. Ya know i think Szymons cute...but that he'll be really hott when he's a senior, haha, so i hope he stays around till then. haha. Went to Hailey's house this morning it was fun, went with Megan. Hey apparently Janet approves of me. Go ME Go! Hailey and i are going to room together over culturals. Which are also going to royally suck.

I thought she was BSin' me i was like c'mon don't bull shit with me, she's like uhh no seriously. I jumped out of bed the fastest i could and just put on what my hands came across first. Turned out i was late to class as it was. But i didn't get a detention. On the way Tanya was like here take this for your hair. Take it for your hair, handing me a jacket, and of course it wasn't raining!!!-yet. So then i got rained on, and i was exhausted so i guess it was a good way to wake me up. Haha, Szymon's mad at me. Couldn't really give a damn cuz i didn't do anything. He threatened me saying that he could get his brothers and all those people on my ass. Trust me the Saudi's are just lookin for a reason to beat the shit out of them. God, he's so stupid. I'm tired of his shit. I'm sorry that i'm not who he wants me to be, but i'm me, and he just needs to get over that. I don't think i'mma date anyone ever anymore. Cuz i mean whats the point, u kiss, u cuddle u get happy, then someone breaks the other one's heart and it's over and u eventually just forget about him. Whatever, maybe thats just my opinion.

Sittin' in English class. Thinkin' my mind realing. I have this passion of hate inside me. Simon is pissing me off. He's changed, he's not the same person anymore. And i'm not the only one who thinks so. Sod is just some arrogant asshole. God, my grade is like a bunch of 4th graders in class. Laughing at retarded things, talking over eachother. Speaking thinks they know nothing of. But I'll just sit her silently. Good God, I could contradict everything that comes out of their mouths! I respect Mr. McAvoy so much....he has sucha point of view that i love and respect. There are so many shovenists in my class. They're so 1 dementional, so artificial, so one-sided, with one view. Like that fucked-up Romanian, not to mention that Mongolian and his ""best friend."" You should never trust a Mongal either...because Alex pointed out to me and Emma, that they're not to be trusted because they attacked the Chinese for no reason. I mean sure the Chinese are communists and should die for that tho, right Paloma? (jk). **Teehee I have a procastination page Teehee**. I write mean things about people that i hate, oh, but don't worry it's for good cause. hhhhmmmmmm.....what else is new? I might break up with Nao, I duno. Ricky and Dian said a lot of powerful things to me that i've been thinking about and still am. Lunch bells about to ring...

And then I had to go eat a barfy lunch. Apparently the war is over now...doubt it tho, it's probably like undercover war now or somethin, i duno. haha i'm in the library now. Emma's goofin 'round with Moody. And Szymon is just bein an ass, cuz apparently he's changed and thats who he is now. Has to act all cool round his brother and so-called friends. Honestly I really miss the old him. And Moody is my lil brother, whom i LOVE!! And to the rest of you he says u should address him as the ""Da Bomb-Diggity."" Uhh well first half of study hall is almost over. Second half i return just to pack up Jessica's things for her with Emma.

"event","Sittin in Jo-burg airport...avec mon frere. I'm so bored...i'm in the premier lounge. Apparently Danu might be here later....i've been here for like 3 hours and still have 1 more hour to go. *SIGH* Oh, wellz theres food to eat and it's free besides the 50 i paid for entrance. And uhh theres alcohol here too...so it's all good. I got 7 hours of sleep last night, 7 hours of sleep the night before, and 8 hours of sleep the night before that. uhh my manicure looks good.....my finger nails are gettin' longer...well they're not THAT long but like for me it is. Theres nothig to say but i wish there was something of interest to discuss. Lets see the events of yesterday. I had to wake up at, yes folks i did, at EIGHT! Which sucked ass, had to go and do that for my prom dress...which would barely fit in my suitcase!! Then i went for my manicure...and Sinikka and I just talked about Hanna and WIS...haha it was really interesting and i got some stories of hanna as a child..teehee. BLACK MAIL...haha jk. Then i stayed there till hanna got home from school then went to the ""mall"" as some would call it. And there was DIAN!! OMG like he's not hott....some ppl might say he's ugly...but theres something about him that made him drop dead gorgeous...i was like h..h.h....hhhhi dian! i swear pooh if u weren't there i would of ""macked"" him as slapy would say. haha. umm yah so Dian Pooh and I went to Golden Gate cafe had something to drink...and he wasa making fun of me for drinking hott chocolate when it was so hott outside. o0o0o and i have a new word inspired by Dian...teehee KINKY. It was funny I was tellin' KINKY jokes I and Dian was like no it's fine don't stop...and omg none of u would of believed it Pooh was actually like talking...ya know like making conversation, using her vocal chords for once....*sniff sniiff* i was so proud!! haha. Then Hanna and I went to pick up my prom dress at 5 then we headed to my house and goofed around and sent halarious sms to ppl...haha none of which i'll write down. but hanna did riaan ever reply to it? Then we had a nice meal and i packed while hanna played around on my laptop and she wrote me this really sweet note!! It was so sweet it made me sad...cuz that was the last i saw of her i almost cried....it's soooo sweet. pooh i'm always ur mufflez!! even if i hate my nickname haha...jk....it's not THAT bad. Then uhhh Hanna went home at like 11. And i continued packin' for another hour...then i went to the Embassy cuz i was gunna make some phone calls but i blanked out on numbers so i just wrote a really long e-mail reply to Na-o and Emmie Emz. I think that that whole quarantine thing at school is guna be hell theres' guna be so much confusion...but i mean where the hell would they quarantine someone...i don't get it. Theres no where in Switz where u could quarantine someone! What would they do send them to the nurses' office....they can't prevent shit but w/e.If they wana try go ahead as long as i don't get sick or quarantined in the process. O and on the topic I hate dr. o. I thought he was cool but he's bein' an ass to me...soo he can kiss my ass that bastard. No wonder his wife left him...cuz of his fucking anger managment problems...he's sucha dumbass.Anyway where was i when sucha distrubed thought came into my mind....uhh o yah my day. Well i went to bed at 2. Woke up at 9:30. Went to int'l day at W.I.S. omg i saw marco!!! MY BABY MACHA!! I was sooo happy he hasn't changed at all he wears the same clothes still too it's adorable. Then I saw my x, FLORIAN. OMG i'm so sorry but yesis man he's so fucking hott!! OMG i was like : O i couldn't close my mouth. The best is his lips...trust me i know. ;) haha like at mischa's party...with those chiopractic beds. haha.  FUN FUN...i swear to god that was the best party EVER!! But when i saw Florian...i don't think i've ever liked someone as much as him. I'd have a fling with him any day. I'd NEVER go out with him again...the only reason i would would be for the play cuz as a boyfriend he sux ass. The reason why i miss him so much as a boyfriend even though it's bee like 1 year and 5 months since we broke up he was the best kisser...OMG!! haha remember all my Pearl Harbor ppl? haha lets just say that that was THE BEST movie...even tho i didn't watch a bit of it. That was like March 25th of 2001 that we saw that movie...cuz i remember thats when Florian and i first started going out. haha it was just kinda like wham bam thank ya mam with him tho. Like the first day...was already like uhh h yah u know...but hey it was still !nxa!. Anyway back to my ORIGINAL point. At int'l day...i saw a lot of ppl i hadn't seen but i just basically went to say good-bye to my friends. So i said my farewells to Slug, Baros, and Brown boi. I was tryin' to find ben...but like he had to practice music and by the time he got out i had to leave cuz i had a hair appoitment at 10:30. but it's oaky cuz i didn't get to say good-bye to hanna either. it doesn't reallly phaze me though that i didn't get to say bye. cuz i know that i'll be seein' them again and they're awesome at keepin in touch and they're good friends so i know we'll always be tyte. As well as brown boi, and baros. but slug was really sweet. I was wearin' my ""airplane clothes"" and so i was like ya know please excuse my appearance and slug was like O NO lauren don't worry about it you look great! and laurence was like yah. I use to like hate slug cuz i thought there was something wrong with him. But theres' not he's just really sweet and thoughtful and kinda different in personality. Anyway i said my good-byes and rushed off to the airport. My parents i could tell were really concerned about sending me back. They kept talking to me about it. My mom was like the devil is waiting for u there, don't give in look to Jesus...it's amazing how she is so religious i just wouldn't be able to do it. I mean put my trust and faith and way of life ALL like COMPLETE TRUST in someone i've never meet before but just have been told about by people who got it from a book. But *ugh* i duno, i'm tryin' to avoid any talk of religion cuz i have no idea where i stand in it. Think i'mma go read. Wana save my computer battery and start packing up soon cuz i'm sure we'll be leaving soon on our long ass flight. i hope i can sleep even though i never can!! ugh i've speant most of my day at the god forsaken airport. but soon i'll spend my majority in a god damn plane. UGH!! duno how i'm suppose to do this."

"event","20 more days till lil miss me's birthday!! Teehee. Ugh i've been so busy...!! Last Monday I had a dental and a hair appotment. Then went over to Chrissy's. Tuesday i had the first of my many prom dress fittings and i had to wake up at 11!! I'm sorry but do i look capable of wakin' up at 10? Then I had to go to the orthodontist!! Yet again!! Then i had to go to an unwanted dinner with Christoph and family...UGH....but that didn't go as bad as planned mainly dreading it cuz i had a temperature and was SICK and i even took a nap after having a niced conversation avec ma petit amis...Na-o! Just to be woken up telling me to get presentable for i had to go to dinner with Marietjie and such...i was SOOO mad haha.  Wed. i was suppose to go to dinner with Dian but NO he had to cancel cuz he has exams..*sigh* i really wanted to see him it's been like 1 year and a half!! And i hear that he's gotten a lot hotter!! And he was pretty hott himself...haha i'll never forget what he said to Rian about Grace. ""Damn she was hott....but then she stepped into the light!"" teehee i'm sorry Macy but u must admit that was pretty funny! That was like almost 3 years ago that party. Anyway That got cancelled as well as the prospect of me goin to the movies with Laurence. But don't worry i then had another Prom Dress Fitting. Then today...
	I WENT BACK TO W.I.S....OMG i thought i was guna laugh and rejoice at the fact that i was in Switzerland...but NO i end up missing the place like hell! I have such good friends...like, Rowly, Laurence, Ben, Monique...OMG i could spend my life with them! They're so entertaining, we're so tyte. I went to last break...speant that time with Renato (sluggy), Rowland (My cuz brown boi, Rowly), Ben (haha bend over), Monique (!MUKO!), Johannese (UGH he's so annoying...jo), Mischa (Mad Cow Man..haha remember Midgard?), Laurence (Boots, Baros, Bazz, and so on), and if there were other people...well you're not important cuz i forgot you...haha jk. Brought pizza and coke for the gang. Then went to English class where the highest grade in the class for an ""essay"" thingy they wrote was 75%. haha WAY TO GO ROWLAND!! haha but we all know that deep down sluggy had the best story. It was funny ""billy brag"" got a 17/35....hahahaha and she had written 23 pages. The teacher was like yelling at the class...she kicked Rebecca, Chiny, and Mandy outta the class cuz they didn't have the assignment...Rebecca was so funny about it later...i got a lift to Ben's house through her...cuz of some car pool thing they have arranged. Speant my time there with Laurence and Ben...haha Laurence sometime we must ""vacuum"" (**wink wink**). I duno why but i couldn't stop flirting with baros...he was gettin annoyed with me cuz i'd laugh like macy's evil laugh....they were so tyte tho, and like whenever i'm with baros i think of grace cuz in 7th and 8th grade whenever i was with Laurence it was cuz Grace needed to drag him along...haha no offense laurence but it's true. Remember when we had our lil sleepover....and i climbed into bed with you Laurence, marked your face with pen, and poured water on you and you were all ""NO NO THE SEED WON'T GROW!!"" haha good times that was when he was still goin' out with billy brag, vanessa. anyway where was i....uhh....yah so i went to Ben's with Laurence, and Laurence had something which most people call the ""hick-ups"" but i duno what the hell that was laurence and it definitly wasn't the hickups!! hahaha....u frog u! Anyway brown boi came over later...they kept doin' mean things to my cell phone and LAURENCE wouldn't stop givin' me wedgees...bastard u, haha. Laurence is such a bad influence on me with his ""literature"" as to midly call it...haha but i love it...i love talking like baros...baros and i have established a relationship....it's like i'm Lauren and he's Lauren's bitch...haha i love it, it can only bring us closer. I duno what was into me today but i almost got with baros.....i think it was the way he was actin with me i think he wanted to...*sigh*. I had to leave ben's at 4:30 for yet ANOTHER Prom dress fitting, and i have to go back there at 8:30 tomorrow morning!! Okay....i can wake up at 10...but 8? ummm NO!!! Then tomorrow i have a manicure with Sinikka, Pooh's mom."

"event","OH DEAR GOD!! Can i hate my life more so then i do now? Yes i do know hate is a strong word, that is precisely why i'm using it! Don't lecture me on the definition of hate...i've gone to too many church services, listened to too many lectures, heard too many people tell me why we should hate hate....but then again isn't that contradictable? And i don't even give a flying fuck if contradictable isn't a word, but NOW IT IS? OK? Well last night was...uhh interesting. I had fun, made money, then spent the night at Hannas. It was SUCH a relief for a moment to escape reality at Hanna's house and have everything seem like it was normal. Was lazy the whole day...was in a bad mood at one point but i duno why, and i came out of it after some SOLITUDE!! Well then I watched some of Pearl Harbor and retreated to my room getting ready for bed at 2 in the morning. When dear Mammy decides to walk in...out of the blue she starts talking to me about MY LIFE and MY PROBLEMS...and how it's going to be affected and so on and so forth. Okay I don't want to talk about it. Who would want to? Does she just want me to hate myself even more? It's like here Lauren I know you're recovering from all the pain you've done to yourself so i'm just going to remind you of how in every single detail you've screwed up......and this is how your future is guna be affected because we refuse to do the only good thing for you which is leaving you in the school your in, because WE think the better thing for you is, of course not knowing you at all, would be for you to go to a Christian school in the middle of who the hell knows....somewhere around Tyler, Texas. DON'T WORRY IT'S MORE SECLUDED THEN THAT! WoW! I was just pretty much silent the whole conversation, which really erked my mom i could tell but OOO WELL, i'm not in the mood....i'm sorry who would be? Even if i was going to turn everything around like she wants me to and i intend on doing, would it be all in vain just to have to go to TYLER TEXAS? Don't worry 7 more days and 6 shitty more nights and i'm outta this joint! THANK GOD! !"

"event","The days are just booked solid it seems every time i come back home. My arrival was okay. Plane landed early which was always a good thing. I miss all of my Swiss ppl SOOOO MUCH. Simon i think is upset with me cuz of the events of Thursday night. Sunday I pretty much relaxed ya know just chilled unpacked got ""reacquainted"" with my atmosphere.

 Then came Monday...had a facial and manicure that lasted like 3 hours!! Then went to Christoph's house....there i met Laurence (hadn't seen him for like 2 years i missed him so much he's like my brother!!), then I saw Ben (he's grown and is really violently funny), Sergio (we're actually cool with eachother now, but i think he could do so much better then anya sorry but it's true!), riaan (OMG he's so much sweeter now i was like WoW), I also met his cousin Matthew (he's ok, looks like a druggie, honestly wouldn't be surprised), then I met some girl named Sophie (ugh!). Went home later that night.

Then came Tuesday...I thought it was simon's b-day but apparently he claims it wasn't but i could of sworn him tellin' me that it was tuesday...but whatever if he says it isn't i'll just take it for what it's worth. But i'm for sure it was RIAAN'S BIRTHDAY! ! Happy birthday riaan sweetie, ( For Riaan: we may of had our fights, but you were always so funny, and even after all we've been through together u took everything so well, so thank u!!) I was suppose to go to dinner with him and some other W.H.S. ppl but i got sick and felt horrible so decided not to go anywhere....just to be dragged out to dinner with Christoph and his family...i did have fun, but it was the whole principal of getting out of my pajamas changing, looking nice, etc. when i had a fever...poor me....But it was fun and funny...Josh was bein' pretty halarious. That day was going hhorribly but then Na-O called and everything seemed to get better!

Then FINALLY the events of today came...had a doctor appoitment at 12...O JOY! Wasn't allowed to eat anything...it sucked! Had to get a ""physical"" (if u ask me those physicals are really TOO physical!! She even had the gull to tell me that my birth mark was in a very odd spot!! WHY IN THE WORLD would she be lookin there!!) I think the name should be changed from physical to down right dirty and personal! GOSH! i felt so violated. She took my blood too! First time someone had taken my blood and i hadn't complained or even CRIED! I was very proud of myself....and if you're one of those ppl that know my horrifying fear of shots ESPECIALLY blood being taken u'd understand and would be proud of me too! =D . Then I got out of there at one. Had lunch at 1:30 very quickly at Sardina's just to run off to my hair appoitment at 2! UGH way too hasty for me! My hair lasted till five. Then Na-O called. I felt pretty special cuz i mean how many people can say they get a long distance phone call from their friend in Japan...haha bet u can't say that! =P . Got off the phone with Na-O at like six...got on~line talked to Simon...who seemed pissed off at me...seriously sometimes the conflicts i have with Simon are just so fudgin' stupid! SERIOUSLY!?! Then i talked to Heather, I'm sorry but sometimes she's just so irritating...the only time i can stand her is in the dorm when Ms. Perrys on duty and i go out in the hall to skip study hall by talking with Ms. Perry....maybe one of the reasons why i like heather then is because of her endless amount of food she gives. MUAHAHAHA. Then I had to go meet Hanna for dinner...all the good places, aka only panarotis, was booked solid, so our dinner was the movie's popcorn and jelly tots. (haha remember WiS kids 'love u lots like jelly tots!!"" hahaha)  Went and saw the Tuxedo with ben and laurence too. Kept throwin pop corn at laurence...left there and started walking around with them. Then to find some random girl walk up to me telling me that her friend wants my number so i couldn't delay too much so i gave her my number eventually...it's ok i don't mind except for the fact the guy is like 19, and i have a boyfriend....but it's k i leave in less then 2 weeks, and i doubt the guy will have the guts to call me. I'll keep u updated on him...i duno what he looks like tho. I miss macey nothing here is complete without her. Cuz like no one has ""our"" humor babes! It sucks ass....sweet ass that is (remember?) Ran into riaan there too, he's been sucha sweetie lately...sometimes i think he has alterior motives for his sweetness...oh wellz don't really mind right now cuz he's bein' nice to me and thats all that matters hahahaha! Uuuum also ran into Christian, Marcel, Jennifer, and Chrissie today. Christian looked uglier...Marcel did too...when he hugged me i could feel his facial hair and it was like LOOONG SPIKES man seriously...it was repulsive...he didn't even hug Hanna bye he just kinda laughed and walked away she just had this funny look as he walked away and then said what the hell....it was funny commin from Hanna. Went to a cafe had some cake then i drove home in my dad's car...i'm enjoyin' it here...thought i was going to be miserable here honestly. but i'm happy!! Well now the days events end with me sitting here in my room all alone....*sigh* but solitude after a long day is nice...That night i got a lot tigheter with Matthew, he's a druggie, but he's cool...and Sophie is cool too even tho she does lezzie things with rebecca...or atleast thats what i heard...eww nasty visuals!!
i hope i get LOADS of sleep tonight cuz tomorrow i'mma be so busy. I need to go to town to buy a white shirt cuz i remembered i don't have any and i need a nice white shirt for concerts...and i don't have ONE! it's driving me mad! Then i have to be at Christoph's house by five so i can waitress till 2 in the morning at Antoinette's catering service banquet thing...it's okay with my parents and i'm gettin' paid N$100...it's not a lot but i can put it to a nice present for Na-O. I hope he likes his gift...I think i know what i'm guna get him. It has to be something nice because it's guna be four months on Saturday. *Sigh* and it's guna be without him. O well i'll send him a card or something and he better appreciate that haha jk. Gunna go get ready for bed though cuz i'mma need a lot of sleep for tomorrows work...and i'm going to bring an extra shirt JUST incase anything spills on my white shirt. Nitey"

"event","I have an hour and thirty minutes left on my computer battery...O JOY....sittin at some crappy cafe...WoW it even has a crappy name...""NEWS CAFE""!! Man thats intense...i'm slightly warped considering my lack of sleep! Went to the Geneva airport, with some Japs. (Akira and Sonami), some Mexicans/Venezualians (Verena, Camilia) plus Chris, Simon W. his gf, and Severin, and NiNi (meng yu). Well as u guessed i had pretty much no one...already at Geneva i already had a ""DISPUTE"" (as they mildly call them now a days) about carry ons and such...we made up....then got to zurich where my brother and i got seperated and yes i did get somewhat lost...but not entirely cuz i knew where i needed to go and i kinda knew where i was...i just didn't know how to get there...so Meng-Yu helped me when he needed to go to the OTHER side of the aiport. He's so sweet. I said good-bye to him half way to where i needed to be....aww it's sad to see him go cuz i duno if he thinks we're good friends...but to me we're awesome friends, cuz like we've been through a lot and i can tell him anything and he's funny and understands me. Anyway..also said good bye to Chris there too.  He was a sweetie also....on the flight to Zurich the guy besides me...just like u said athena...thought he was invisable and i'm guessin' he thought no one could see that he almost had his FIST up his nostril! All i can say is *pick me a winner*. On  the flight to Jo-burg there was an old couple in front of us....it was NASTY they couldn't stop making out, it was like they were horny teens or something nasty! Then there was another old couple behind us...and the guy hits my brothers head and tells my brother to NOT recline his chair when the person in front of us had his chair reclined and the ppl complainin' had theirs reclined my brother told him he'd put his seat up when the food came....I hope those french old ppl behind us had a HORRIBLE flight....haha i kept moving my seat back and forth eventually the guy like poked my arm continuously till i turned around told me to stop...what an idiot..honestly! Was on that flight for about 10 hours or something. Now i'm FINALLY in jo-burg with one more flight to go....i look horrible i feel even worse....my eyes are all glassy what lil make up i had on, is now completly deminished....my hair looks horrible....and it was grand (!) i ran into Katy, and Natasha's friend, i forget her name but they both live in angola, and i see them feelin' horrible, this is the fisrt and last time i travel while being on my period!! *Tummy wummy hurting* Okay well i'm just  kinda blabbering, i'm actually kinda looking forward to going home i just have to make sure i look good haha. and RIGHT when i get home i have to tan...cuz in namib if u don't tan it's like ur classified as anti-social cuz if ur not tan they think u never go out....they never contemplate the fact that like u just came from a place with 6 meters of snow on the ground...no never thought about that did ya? Okay well i'm just bein' silly and dillusional...so i better go, besides i should probably save some bettery as much as i don't want to....it's SIMON'S birthday on tuesday..i think...but u'll hear more about that tuesday.
O yah one another that happened tho on Thursday night...the last night i was in Switz. me and naoya got in this huge fight!! He thinks that i'm guna cheat on him with Simon or something...but c'mon i'm an innocent lil angel i'd never cheat... teehee. *evil grin* But he got all paranoid and started yellin' and cussing and it really pissed me off so i just walked away and told him i don't take stuff like that from anyone esp him...so we both stormed off from ceasars....apparently he was crying...and i was too but i was shaking more with rage then feeling sad...but OMGosh i miss him sosososososo much....i miss all of u guys loads...well lookin' around for a place to go....HEY and i finally did get a spike braclet from athena it's REALLY nice...thankie athena...and remember athena...RUBBA DUCKIEEEEE UR THE OOOONE! hahaha buh biez for now think i'm guna go on a lil journey to find my long lost brother cuz i have no idea where he is and this really isn't a big airport and theres definitly not a lot to do... well thank u for listening it really cured my boredom...haha buh biezz."

Anyway...enough of the depressing topics...uhh something positive uhh...o yah Athena is hookin' me up with more bracelets...so thats uhh positive. I found Emma's jumper so i won't have to buy her a new one.

I feel like changin who i am slightly...just like the way i dress the things i do..the way i'm percieved. I'm sick of all this girliness of all this love crap. Wearin' hearts on, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc. Besides it's always healthy to change ur look every now and then...so Norah, Hailey, and maybe Heather r hookin me up with some shit. Can't do work...Dr. O is callin' a meeting at 8:30. We better be allowed to watch the news or i'll raise holy hell. Apparently we're allowed to go downstairs at 2nd half if we wish to watch the news. I need to catch up so thats what i'mma do. I need someone right now...not my boyfriend, not my family, not my friends really...i need someone else....someone who i can just cry on their shoulder, and they'd listen...someone who i could just cuddle with for comfort and have no strings attached. I just want to get back home and see rowly, ben, hanna, christoph...all of them and more. Hopefully they'll help me...."

If only i could re-make some of my decesions...i wouldn't be in this position...i wouldn't be where i am with the people i'm with...so to speak...I really hate myself now...i really disrespect myself now too. I wrote a song about it downstairs in the red frog when i was thinkin' things over...I'll state a lil part of it...i have the tune and everything. It goes:
She didn't know all the possibilities
Or what was to come.
She denied the things she knew and lived for all 
along.
She turned her back, went off-track.
and now she's left all alone.
She crys inside. (the pain it hurts)
She lost her life. (can it get any worse)
She's so confused.
A broken fuse.
What can it take?
To erase all that she has done?
She's hurt herself. (the pain it hurts)
She's got no stealth (can it get any worse)

Thats just a part of it...I'm still workin on it...but it's a really good tune...just need to put everything all together. Well restriction is over in ten...and i need to go get mr. stef to sign my on-campus book. Go to dinner cuz theres' a 6 o'clock assembly...i don't want to go but i will..cuz apparently it's a half weekend if u miss it.

Also i have to wake up at 7 in the morning and sit in the cafeteria where ur not allowed to do ur hwk OR take a looong vigorus walk...it's not your choice which one u have do in the morning restriction. I also have to carry this book around wherever i go and have my teachers sign it for every class have the restriction or study hall supervisor sign it and write comments on how i was...it's a pain...but atleast i've made my on-campus book pretty, UNLIKE JESSICAS!! haha. Last night was fun...Ms. Perry was on duty and was lettin us do a lot. She was telling us jokes lettin' us do our laundry...and whenever she'd go check the other two restrictee floors...and Jess and I would stuff pillows in our shirts and run down the hall to run into eachother. Eventually Lami saw us and we crashed into her cuz she wanted us to. That was a fun night. This morning we walked 3/4 of the way up the mountain on the blue trail...after gettin there through some screwed up long route...at 1 i went to the weight room for two hours with Jessica, Benna, and Pernilla...there just decided she'd stay the WHOLE YEAR THROUGH! ! So happy about that...teehee she's my on-campus buddy. I owe Steven something from our bet but HE OWES ME SALSA AND CHIPS!! Or atleast he has for the past 3 days!! For my 3-5 restriction i talked to my parents...and took a shower cuz i was so tired from my work out(s)...And Ria is on duty for my night restriction she's bein' a bitch as usual...naggin' me about how dirty my room is...she asked for my computer i told her i had lended it to melissa...but i'm typin' on it now teehee...i duno for some weird reason i have this urge to talk to simon...think i'm guna go call Hanna and tell her all of whats happening in my life....*sigh* if Ria comes in while i'm on the phone i'll just tell her it's my parents and that THEY called ME. haha i'll write later but i'm still really bored and have finished my yogurt and am eating my babybel cheese with baby tomatoes...i'm going for the whole NUTRITION thing...good luck to me!"

I now have on-campus, meaning i can't go off school grounds to town or anything, and just got through a gruesome telephone conversation with my parents. I accidently hung up the phone, so i'm sure he won't be too pleased when i have to call him back in 15 minutes...i'm not looking forward to that either. My head hurts from crying...and my Mother actually said (this is say word for word) ""Lauren, if you weren't my daughter I'd have nothing to do with you."" OUCH! ! Well theres a great memory that'll stick for life. Then in the end she was like I didn't mean to say that blah blah blah...i'm sorry i love you blah blah blah...I was just like mhm yah u too. Theres a 2% chance that I'm gunna be here for Sophmore year...but i think that'll soon be 100% chance. I just have to not drink or smoke (easy.) BUT i have to break up with naoya...hmmm. This is a tricky one but we'll see how it all plays out. I cried today during B period...first time i really let other ppl see me cry...it was pretty sad..cuz i honestly thought they were guna expell me...cuz Dr. O didn't believe me...i have to finish my on-campus THE WEEK AFTER spring break!! I better be able to go on Freshman vaca tho! Or i swear...o yah and apparently teachers are sayin i curse and use the F word frequently...wtf (haha...i mean...what the fudge) is up with that no i don't! Whoever her sources r are pretty warped and they obviously don't know me. It was pretty scary when Dr. O came to talk to me today..he barged into the library yellin' my name sayin' he needed to see me. UgH! Then i get in there just to be told how stupid i am, and if i was aware of what i was doing. I thought the funniest part was when Dr. O and Mr Sipple gave Jess fire hazard brochure things..haha. Well I'm going to go ponder of ways to ""turn my life around and save my soul"" They days keep gettin' worse...can't wait to just go home and be at home in the same house as my parents but just not do anything with them...theres no telling of the outcome if they dare send me to a private Christian school."

NO...mainly cuz no one knows what love is. All i know is that love is something that is not and never will take a role in my life. Can anyone say they truly know me? No. Whats the longest friendship i've been able to maintain. Hmm there was 3rd grade Autumn...sure sometimes we might talk or see eachother once every 4 years. But she doesn't even know who i am anymore. Theres Gwen, 5th grade, she use to be my best friend in the whole wide world, use to tell her everything, use to know her inside out. But she never knew me, never really wanted to know me, but now my best friend has turned into a stoner. She's so stoned she doesn't even know who i am. No one at this school knows me they can know facts about my life..but that doesn't mean they know me. How can anyone know me when the tightest friends i have-haven't even known me for more then 4 years. Grace, we're tyte when we're in the same town..but other then that we act like complete strangers around eachother. Hanna, we're tyte all the time...she's the closest anyone is to me and ever will be. But we can't always get together. I don't want to move to fucking bulgaria man....i don't want to be in Switzerland; but if i'm not in switzerland there where would i be?? In namibia? Yah i got friends there but i'm not moving back in with my family. Virginia? Fuck those people...Deema with her whole I'M HEAD OF THE CHEERLEADERING SQUAD!! And Gwen the stoner....and all those other ppl and their stupid issues. Texas?? There's no way I'm living in that blasted heat...with the rest of my crazy family. NO WAYZZ. I think my brother hates me. I think i hate myself. Theres no one there for me...except Pooh, but she's in fuckin' africa...my parents are mad at me...raggin' me about contacting them. Raggin' me about going to church. Well i'm still sick...I can't sleep...so i'm not going to church...cuz i'm not wakin' up at 7 like i'm going to school or something thats just wack!!! And no one better give me that shit about ""Lauren are you okay...Lauren I'm concerned...Lauren whats wrong?"" If i wanted you to know i'd tell you ok? So just piss off!"

hot chocolate all over her body.
If i were a guy

I'd have a ruler sized dick that'd make u wana
scream and shout!
Kinda like Emma,
the other day.
She kept beggin' me to stay.
But i said no

If you get mad at me
I'll pout and plee.
I have a problem with confrontations.
My butt is ticklish
So don't touch it.
If you prode or poke
I could have a ceaser or a stroke
They call me lela
It's kinda sill-ay.
Whats wrong with lezbians and bi's

Cuz thats not what u'd be sayin' when u see those cocks.
Not to mention guys wanking off.
I come from Nigeria
But that don't make me inferior
Call me a bush wom-an
Whats wrong with that?
Or are u just sayin' that cuz i'm black?
I wear granny panties

English will be ok, except for the fact i didn't do my homework. Geometry...ugh i hope i don't have to have ""words"" with mr. bitch off again! G...i hope we get to rest cuz we did such a nice concert yesterday...but mr. fuller and ms. sons are such ass' i doubt we'll be able to. E..one of the worst period if not the worst...FRENCH...and F will be okay...Bio. it's been gettin' better lately, probably because we have been watching movies...Some people are really annoying me though...Lets just say my ""neighbor"" and all her irritating, fat, loud, wanna-be, punk friends...dear god...I think i should go before I blow up about them!"

"event","Head hurt today..didn't really mind it. Did nothing outstanding today. Uumm A period i got my A. World History teset back...hell yah got 40%!! So now I'm doing extra credit to bring it up to a 70%...but it's a shit load of a lot!! O well....B period...nothing happened really. O YAHHHH!! Now i remember what occured today. Megan G. and Louise got busted drinking!! Yep yep...it was in dorm...so they have off campus...they're gone. Apparently the school found out cuz Louise room mate told. But it's okay...I'm not mad at Natasha...didn't really like Louise anyway. Haha...I know it's mean but still. Besides it's a good lesson for the both of them. I kinda miss Megan..and I feel kinda sorry for her...but not much. Thats the risk u take when u know ur not suppose to be doing it. But w/e. didn't get to say good~bye to Mego...BUT I MISS YA...I mean who the hell am i suppose to get sugar from for my hot chocolate...ha ha jk!! Lets see....C period i duno how but i made up with Melissa...really weird..no one said anything but after 5 days of ignoring eachother we finally just picked up a convo. D period...got in a fight with Andrew cuz lets just say last term he let someone do something...but it was last term, and he was mad cuz i wouldn't let it go. I'M SORRY ANDY!! Then Simon harassed me during health..tsk tsk Simon. (haha) But u guys should seriously see Simons tummy it's hott!! hehe, don't be embarassed Simon..don't go blusing either. F period was funny with Ms. Ryter she was like ""do i have dumbass on my forehead Mo?"" haha, Mo was really pissing her off it was funny. Turns out she' from Waco...like my Mom...might i add Waco is one of the most boring places on earth!! Have to go there this summer. G period i goofed off with Melissa...Yung was all shocked. We were making fun of him and pokin' him...and he was all :O !! Haha. He's so cool. Then after class went to Top-Pub store...then had to go to extra help about the test i failed...then me and Jess. talked to Mr. CrackAvoy for 45 minutes...really cool guy. Jess had to leave me for V-Ball...so i just chilled back at Beau-Site. I feel so sorry for Mo...he accidently broke the window to the elevator shaft!! Hope he doesn't get restriction. He was just bangin' on the door downstairs cuz Julian locked him in...and the bangin made some glass break. He's afraid he'll get expelled he'll probably just have to split the cost for the window pane with Julian..I hope thats all. But it's study hall...and me best be getting to work..so TTFN."

"event","OMGosh! This weekend was soooooo much fun!! I was finally able to get off the mountain with the excuse of a basketball tournament. I left Friday...and it took about seven hours to get there. The bus ride was fun. I sat with Lami we listnened to music, I think we might of fallen asleep a little before stopping for dinner. Later on the bus I watched a movie and fell asleep with Ni Ni...he was so sweet!! He's sucha good friend! The normal time it takes is 6 hours but it was a little longer with traffic...we got in at like what 10:30...and had free time till 11. So i went to town and chilled with Lami...we only had 30 minutes to roam around but it was fun. While roaming town a bunch of drunk guys pulled over and started shouting stuff at us in French waving at us with their beers to come to the car and they were honking the horn blasting their techno music. Then later some Italian guy came up to me and started speaking Italian and I was like uhhh I don't speak Italien and the guy was givin' me ""funny"" looks. That night Lami nor I could sleep. Everyone else was dead tired. Lami and I went for a walk at 1 in the morning still unable to sleep....it was really freaky. A police car drove up and I mean we're just standing outside the hotel...and the guys start speaking Italien and we were like uhh we don't understand...so they asked us in French if there was a problem and we were like nono. So they drove off givin' us shifty looks...so we decided to go back into the hotel. We were finally able to sleep. But we got really cold cuz we didn't want to use the blankets for other reasons. (Lice but not on your head and a lot more detailed....thank u for those nasty visuals ANNE and LAMI !!) Woke up at 7 to find a pair of pants i had left on my bed...on Lami's feet..apparently she said her feet had gotten cold and since we had kicked the blankets off the bed cuz we didn't want to use them..that my pants were the next best thing. Lami also sleeped cuddled up next to me cuz she was ""cold""..Lami is actually bi, so i know that was just an excuse to get close to me! jk..that day the boys played 2 games I watched them both. We played 3 games. We won the first two..but the 3rd one we lost...I don't think that should really count though, because for one the referees were students from the school and they were so biest like while shooting a free throw the girl crossed the line and we were like no that shouldn't count WTF!!?? And the guy looked at Benna and just laughed and smiled...and Benna was just like you ain't right. They weren't calling against the other team..i'll just say that. Then also during the 3rd game Lami had a little anger managment problem at the beginning so her game was off. Then least of all in the second half i took a blow to the head and recieved a small concusion. I don't remember too much of what happened on friday because of it. I couldn't remember what the school looked like and what my friends looked like...just their hair color. Well looks like Jesse and I have something in common now...haha. How i got my concusion? i don't know how i got on the floor but I was getting up and i guess the girl didn't see me cuz she ran straight into me with her knee hitting my temple jaw and the back of my head...I then blacked out and hit the OTHER side of my head on the hard wood floor!! OUCH! Then someone came rushing to me...some woman with black curly hair. I dont' remember what she looked like....apparently she was a nurse. All i remember her doing is putting ice on me and telling me to breathe with her...and to keep my eyes open. Lami was so funny...she got so mad she was like ""Lauren who the fuck did that I'm going to fuck them up so good....come on Lauren just point her out."" I was like I don't know who it was and so she was all ""Well guess at one and I'll kick her ass."" It was funny she was so mad. I was so tired...I had no balance Lami and Benna helped me to the truck. I was so tired and was unable to sleep cuz they were afraid i was going to go into a comma (EXCUSE THE SPELLING I""M NOT AS SMART AS EMMA!!!) So i went out clubbing it was funny cuz Anne got intoxicated, and was saying so much funny stuff. Joe was soooo cool that night...he was so sweet, so was Yung, Hans, Christian,and Meng-Yu!! I love you guys! OMGosh Bu looked so pretty that night it was incredible!! Curfew was 1. No one was breathlilized. And Jerry and Hilary had some big mishap...and I think Jerry ended up spending the night in our room. Sunday came...the guys had one game. Watched that took some pictures...then we went to town, ate lunch, and loaded the bus at 12:45. The weather was GORGEOUS!! So much better then Leysin I miss it mucachos! The bus trip was halarious! At one point everyone was asleep but then we stopped for a bathroom, and snack break. Mac was play fighting with Lami...haha Lami had sucha cute shirt on...it looked like it was from Talbots or something!! IT was so adorable!! Then I play fought with Mac for awhile. Benna was just an on~looker. And all Dan wanted to do was sleep and not be in cross fire of the fights, but he could never really get out of it. Dan ended up sittin' next to me and Lami retreating to the back of the bus. On the bus...Mac actually BIT Dan...for no reason. Dan has this huge bite mark on his armpit! It's really nasty!! Of all places why the armpit Mac?? We arrived back home at 6, where i was happy to see my KoKoNuTZ, FiFiZ, and Baby Baka, along with the rest of the crew. I missed them loads...haha wasn't even glanced at by Melissa. But who cares about bitches anyway right? And now here i am laying back home in Leysin again with Emma in my bed, and Norah and Heather not shutting the fuck up cuz they're talking to some muffy on the phone! And Emma has lost her slipper in my bed....NO WAIT she found it! UGH the weekend was so tiring but fun....I think I'm ready to go to bed."

"event","Things guys should know about girls: 
                 1. Don't ever lie to us; we always find out. 
                 2. We don't enjoy talking dirty to you as much as you enjoy 
listening. 
                 3. Don't say you understand when you don't. 
                 4. Girls are pretty, but yours is ALWAYS the Prettiest! 
                 5. You don't have PMS; don't fuckin act like you know what it's 
like. 
                 6. Saying something sweet might get you off the hook; doing 
something sweet will always get you off the hook. 
                 7. If you talk about having a big Dick; we know you don't. 
                 8. Size does matter, but only to hoes; not girls that want real
relationships. 
                  9. We don't like it when you act like Mr. Big. 
                 10. A system in your car only impresses your homeboys not us. 

                 11. No matter what you say, your ex-girlfriend is a hoe. 
                 12. It's good to be sensitive, sometimes. 
                 13. If you did something wrong or even if you didn't, 
apologize. 
                14. Be spontaneous; dinner and a movie won't always cut it. 
                15. We are self-conscious by nature; we can't help it. 
                  16. We are DrAmA queens. 
                  17. Fashion police do exist. 
                  18. Don't ask us to give u head; if you are nice you just 
might get it. 
               19. We absolutely DO NOT care about monster trucks, car 
systems, paintball, or anything else you and your friends talk about... in other words shut the fuck up
                20. Hugs and kisses must be given at all times. 
                21.eWe don't shave our legs everyday so get over it. 
               22. Don't make bets about us; we will always find out. 
                  23. Shave; no matter how cool you think your goatee or 
beard or mustache looks, we always hate it. 
                24. Even if you think it is cool to burp, fart, or emitt 
other strange gases from your body, itisnt, so DONT.. 
                 25. Don't compare our breasts with Pamela Anderson's; hers 
are fake, just remember that. ( u have a better shot at ours than you ever 
will with hers, you may as well give it up now) 
                 26. It is not cool to shoot snot rockets. 
                 27. We are beautiful at all times. 
                 28. We will always think we are fat, so humor us and tell us 
we aren't. 
                   29. You can shoot hoops, score a goal, knock down big fat 
guys, and hit a little baseball with a stick, so why the hell can't you piss 
in the toilet and not on it. 
                   30. Most importantly: we are always right; so don't forget 
it."

Now i'm in a fight with Melissa....we had this whole bitch fight thing. But she was bein' sucha bitch. Whenever she has a prob she brings it out on ppl. She was like no i only bitch at u lami karen and jesse, but i mean those as jokes. Thats not true...SO many ppl have come to me complainin' how she brings everything out on everyone!! But ya know w/eof i don't care. Then we had b-ball practice. Out of a team 9...5 of us showed! Thats just warped! And we had told everyone the day before. But Benna was all like c'mon be there u guys I was there at 4! She wasn't there till 4:30, and here she was lecturin' ppl. I was like wtf...have a problem readin' a watch! Here we come Lugano....ready to lose our undefeated streak. Man we're guna suck. I changed my shot...it's either really good or really bad.

"event","Today sucked. First off i wake up late. Everything was going okay...until P.E. Got in a physical fight with Lami and i didn't want to hit back cuz i sometimes have this anger managment problem. But Lami bit me!! It all started off where i went down to the hall in the changing room and Ara's there....and i have no prob with her...but i was like look please don't touch me i'm in a really bad mood. (Cuz when i'm having problems with my anger its best if NO ONE touches me) Well she doesn't touch me...she punches my shoulder! So like i was going to hit her not thinking but instead i stopped myself and grabbed her hair...i wasn't hurting her though...and like i was 'bout to let go. But before i did Steven and Lami thought i was going to kill Ara or something...so they basically held me back...and LAMI decides it's best to bite me!! And she hit me in the face...so i elbowed her twice in her shoulder and collar bone. But it wasn't that hard...and i had let go of Ara...by this time Kevin was there holdin' me back to. BUT I WASN'T HURTIN' ARA!! So then i don't know wtf happened with Lami but she gets this look and fudgin' jumps me!! And starts hittin' me in the face and like i couldn't do shit...cuz if i punched back with my anger managment problem i wouldn't be able to stop...and a lot of shit would of gone down. (Lami has anger managment problems too..but it pisses me off she always brings her anger out on me...and i'm sick of her doin' that shit to me!) So i just pushed her back and Steven pulled her back and i just had to walk away cussing cuz she socked me in they cheek stupid bitch! So i just locked myself in the stall and started punching the wall cuz i was so afraid i was guna do something to someone that i'd regret. Ara was peeking over the top of the stall while standin' on the sink (hehe she's so cute!!) makin sure i was ok, and apologizing. So then i go to P.E. after gettin' changed. Well...i get hit in the face with a frisbee by Steven (it's k i know it was an accident) It didn't really hurt, my mouth wasn't bleeding it was just slightly swollen. And i just stood in the corner and was like please leave me alone. And then i duno i just started crying, most people thought it was cuz the frisbee hit me pretty hard in the face...but i don't know it was because finally tears that were held up that weren't able to come for so long just finally came...it finally hit that my life is so screwed up. That i have so many problems....that i'm a very upset negative person. But ya know what thats ok...as many people say ""Lifes a bitch then you die"". Well I'm not in the mood for anyones shit right now especially Lami's cuz ugh she's tried talking to me but she's done this so often i'm tired of it. I'm sure things will eventually pull through with her but when they do she needs to realize she should take her anger managment probs out on me! So far that has been my day. I cried for 1 period. And i refuse to let people see me cry, if they see you cry, you become more vulnerable....my day has been pretty depressing i've lost my appetite. And apparently all of a sudden i found out we have basketball practice in 2 hours. And it's mandatory...and ALSO Benna was the one who thought it up. Well i don't give a shit if it's mandatory you don't tell someone of a mandatory basketball practice 2 hours in advance, thats just screwed up if you think everyones gunna come. ESPECIALLY if that person had told you that b-ball practice was on wed. and thurs. And it's not like b-ball practice is a regular thing now. I'm going to Lugano over this weekend...thank god, cuz i really need the break away from this place. It's not like i have weekend permission anymore. *Sigh* This life just sux! I'll probably hang out with Yung and Meng-Yu for the most part. I'm tired and my eyes hurt from crying. I'm suppose to go to snowboarding lessons today, but i'm so tired from crying and i'm so upset i can't...so i have to be in the library. WoW this day has really been shit and it's only...2:30 great! Well i'm going to go do my homework. YIPEE **note my sarcasim** Hope your day wasn't as shitty. O and thank u to all u ppl who care!! (Emma, Jess, Simon, Steven, Karen, Ara, [but mainly u guys] etc.)"

"event","Dear Sarah,

Every human being has this thing in their head, it's grey and squishy. They call it a brain. I know you don't know much about it, seeing as you haven't used it in a loooong time, but trust me when I say it's a useful tool.

It helps you understand how ridiculous it is when your boyfriend who you haven't been with for more than three months asks you to marry him. If you used your brain, you would have said no first.



As a side note, people who can't use their brain properly are called ""insane"", or ""mentally retarded"".


Maybe you're both. I don't know, I'm not a doctor. But one thing I do know is that you need to use your brain more often. Think about things before you do them,
and stop being so fucking stupid, you insane retard."

I wish I never had to come home. She was beautiful. Every day I saw her, she looked even more amazing then the day before. Half the time, we didn't need to speak. Being in each others arms was all we needed. As each day came to an end, we'd look at each other and tell each other how much we didn't want me to go home. We were constantly joined all three days. Holding hands, or just hugging. Nothing else mattered.

Saying goodbye was too hard. I tried so hard not to cry in front of her. The second she left my sight I cried for hours. Driving to the plane, flying on the plane, getting off the plane, and even now as I'm writing.

I covered for Rafael cause he needed to do something friday. I took his six hour shift, thinking that Junior would be in later to help me close, which I had no idea how to do. turns out he never showed up, so I was alone. I had to clean the entire deli, deal with all the customers, and close down everything by myself. Keep in mind I haven't the slightest clue what I'm doing. No one taught me how to close before. I was screwed. I was so busy with customers and cleaning that I didn't even get to take my break. In fact, I ended up leaving 15 minutes late. And with Brad shopping for food after, we ended up getting home at ten thirty, giving me no time to talk to my Cutie. I was too tired and exhausted to even tell her anything. I was also cranky cause I worked six hours straight without sitting down once or having my break.

The only thing that was going through my head was ""I'm not even supposed to be here today!""


Go watch Clerks. Great movie.

"event","I haven't updated in a long ass time. I guess it's time, huh?

Let's see, new happenings... Ah, none! No wonder I haven't updated. I have money now, I guess that's new. I haven't spent a penny of it though. I need to save my money to get an apartment with my bro (Chris) and my brother (Brad). I can almost guarantee I'll have my cut of the money before them, since I don't spend any. I don't know about Chris, but Brad can't save money if his life depended on it. Anyway, I'm up so early cause I have to go to work in a few hours. 

So, any new plans? None that are new, but I can put one of my old plans into action soon. Once I have enough money for my cut of the money for the apartment, I can save up to see Steph. God, I can't wait. Part of me wants to just spend the money I have now and go see her as soon as I can. And by part of me, I mean all of me. I love her too much to be so far away. In a few years I can have enough money to get started on moving to Toronto too. Then I'll get my own place there with Steph after a while, and then talk about marriage. Seems like a lot to do and so far away. Sounds like a lot of work too. But I don't care. I'd do anything to be with her, and give up everything if I had to. I can't explain enough about how much I love her. I could go on for hours about how much I love her and it would still only be a fraction of how I feel.

Anyway, before I go writing for hours and end up late for work, I should close this at some point.

I saw Spider-Man 2 recently, it kicked ass.
I might chill with Dontel next week. It's been a while since we've chilled.
I need to chill with Keri, Nikki, and Kristin (Sister, Nicholas and Kristout) some time soon.
I need to beat Four Swords with Chris and Brad.

Okay, I guess that's it for now, I have to finish getting ready for work.

My brother left for work earlier. He put on two dirty socks and didn't change his underwear or take a shower. How can you do that? Yuck, dude."

My trainer, Nate, is pretty cool, so I feel kind of comfortable there. I have to cut meats and cheeses and stuff, which is easy. Knowing what meat or cheese is what isn't. I'm constantly asking Nate what meat is what or what the code is for this or that. It's hard, but worth it.

None of that matters. My goal is to save up enough money so I can get my own apartment, then visit Steph. That's all I care about. I need to see Steph. That's the whole point of this job.

"event","Well today I woke up at 1:00, put on some clothes and bolted out the door to run to school, the last place I want to be. So I went there to give Sami her forehead protector, then went right home after that. 

The second I walk in the door, I'm off to the dentist. Which did NOT go well at all. I need a lot of work done to fix the monstrosity that is my mouth. So after X ray things stabbing my gums, and getting stabbed by random tools in my mouth, I went home. 

I had about ten minutes to rest before the guy at Stop and Shop called. He basically told me I had the job. He told me to go to orientation tomorrow and meet with him Wednesday. 

Then I sat down, and tried to kill time before 7:00 where I could talk to my Cutie. So I played Capcom vs SNK for a while.

I talked to my Cutie, got my much needed happiness and joy for the day, then she had to leave at 11, as usual. God, how I hate 11:00. 

My Cutie introduced me to Full Metal Alchemist (FMA), A kick ass anime. I hate how I'm addicted to it. She started sending the second episode today, which I looked forward to. There was only enough time to get half of it though. 

When Steph had to go, I took out my aggression and hatred of 11:00 in Halo, where I ended up kicking ass.

I decided to look for some Resident Evil Outbreak 2 screenshots and stumbled across something interesting. 







Everything I did today made me think of Steph.

"event","My entry starts from last night.

Me and Maggie found two vodka bottles in my mother's bedroom. For those of you who don't know, we made my mother and her boyfriend promise not to bring any more alcohol into the house over four months ago. This is the third time we've found bottles since the promise.

For those who are unfamiliar with the concept, I will post the definition.

Promise- A declaration assuring that one will or will not do something; a vow.

Now, they obviously don't know what one is, since they've broken promises over and over. My mother has been breaking promises since I was born. 

So when we found them, we put them on the kitchen counter. That wasn't enough for me. I took three little post-it notes and wrote the following words:

FUCK YOU LIARS

Then around 1 or 2 in the morning they come home, my mom wakes me up and says ""Where the fuck was that?""

I simply told her ""Get the fuck out of my room."" Which I had to repeat, since she didn't listen to first time.

Later I go out into the kitchen to find the liars talking. John, my mother's boyfriend, asks me ""So you went in my room, huh? Not too happy about that."" I told them I wouldn't need to check the damn room if I could trust them. My mother then says ""we haven't had a drink in months!"" 

(Reminder: I'm talking the whole time, calmly, while they're yelling. We live in an apartment building, these fucking morons never take it into consideration.)

John loves to push my buttons, swearing and acting like a child to -what looks like- purposely piss me off. So I told him to calm down before he makes me mad. So he pulls out his line he uses every time we get into a confrontation: ""I'm not scared of you, little man."" Keep in mind he's stuttering and shaking from head to toe while saying it. Last time I pushed him on his ass and broke the dishwasher. 

After taunting me, he runs off to his room. My mother won't let me talk to her, so she keeps interrupting me with her nervous excuses which are obviously false. I told her if her boyfriend keeps it up, he's going to get hurt. Most times he throws the first attack, and I'm forced to defend myself. So my mother is crying and flipping out, in an attempt to make me feel guilty and end the conversation, like she's done every time she knows she's wrong. I told her it wouldn't work this time. While I'm in mid sentence, she runs off to her room, slams her door, and locks it. They were so nervous that they forgot to take the key out of the lock. I unlocked it and told her I wasn't done. so she runs out into the living room again so we're away from John, who seemed to find the whole ordeal funny. Seeing him smiling and laughing in this situation made me shake with anger. So I tore those stupid beads from the hall down, grabbed my CD player, and my knife, and left the house. I walked around the neighborhood for a while, not sure how long. I went to my rock and thought about everything. Two spanish kids I could hear behind me were trying to break into a car, but gave up. I was hidden in the shadows of the trees surrounding my rock, so they didn't see me. After a while I went back in the building and out of the rain, not ready to go back home. I walked around the building for another while longer. When I went back into the house, I found out Maggie yelled at Brad for not stopping me. She was worried about me. 
She doesn't need to worry about me, I can take care of myself. Brad and Maggie both assumed I grabbed my knife on the way out. I don't know why they'd assume that, but oh well.

When I came home, I watched a little TV with Maggie, then went to sleep. 




I woke up this morning to find that my body was sore everywhere, and my stomach and head feel like they've been pounded on with a sledge hammer. I kept my mind off of it all day, took a nap, and here I am. My stomach and head are still killing me, and my body is still sore.



After all that, all I want to do now is talk to Stephanie. She'll make me feel perfect again, and she'll talk some sense into me, even if she doesn't know it."

"event","I miss Steph so much already. She's at an anime convention for tonight and I won't be able to talk to her. What really sucks is that we would have been able to voice chat all night since my brother was working til midnight. 
I miss her... Wish I was with her right now. It hurts.

If anyone ever tells you love is easy, they're wrong. When you're in as deep as me, it hurts to go without the one you love for even a day..

I hope I get to talk to her soon and see how everything went.. 

I hope she's having fun right now.

I think I need to pay my rock a visit. 
(No one but Steph knows about my rock. It's a place I go to think about stuff and be alone.)





So anyway, time for my day.
I woke up to my mom telling me Sami called at 7:00. She gives me the phone and it's beeping in my ear. ""Please hang up and try your call again."" I went back to sleep and grunted at whatever my mom was trying to tell me. I woke up later to find my brother on the computer, I talked to him about Naruto while still half asleep, and noticed I wasn't wearing a shirt when I became conscious. Then I went online to see if my Cutie was on when Brad went to work. She wasn't, so I sat there thinking about her for about an hour and listened to music. 
I made a new icon at some time between now and yesterday.
I then called Chris to get my memory card back so my sister can play Naruto- Narutimett Hero.
After running up the hill to his house and running back, I got on the computer, hoping to see my honey online, but she wasn't. I vegged out and watched my sister play Naruto, thinking about Steph the whole time. 
Then something that pissed me off came into my mind, so I played Unreal Tournament 2004, which is a shooting game I play to get aggression and anger out, while entertaining my bored mind in the process. After playing that for a while, constantly checking to see if Steph was on, I just chilled and listened to music.


By the way, if you hear about an 18 year old male from massachusetts killing his mom and her boyfriend, tell them I was with you for the day."

"event","Alright, I woke up a little late this morning, felt like I swallowed the desert, so I decided to go back to sleep and say ""screw it"" to periods 1-3. So I got to school at the end of third and found out I don't get credit for the day, but I had a quiz in psychology to take anyway, so I stayed. (I'm not a complete moron like everyone thinks.)

While getting ready for school I couldn't find my belt. What did I do? I tied my forehead protector around my waist and went to school like that. Looked pretty damn cool, too. So then I went home, talked to my Cutie, played some Capcom vs SNK, then went online. 

Steph has a ton of work to do and I feel really bad. If I lived closer I'd be helping her right now. I'm definitely moving to Canada once I get enough money... I can't stand to be so far away from Steph, it's driving me insane more and more every day. All I want is to be with her and make her happy.

Anyway, I'm currently worrying about Steph since she's so exhausted, and she has a ton of work to do. If I were with her I'd make her go to bed and I'd do the work for her. I wish I could.

So what's been on my mind all day... Steph, of course. She always is, no matter what I'm doing. She's so beautiful, and everything about her is cute.

I should stop writing now before I end up writing a book...

Anyway, I'm out for now.

I love you, Steph."

"event","Today I wore my forehead protector to school, on my arm. I had to work alone in horticulture though, but I got a lot of work done. I had to work with Dan though, which is hard since he's retarded, and not very safe to work with. I had to mow the lawn near the greenhouse and til some soil in the flower beds. When school got out, I played Xbox Live with Chris for a while until he came over. We went to Gamestop and got Tetris and Clone Wars to play with him. 

Throughout the whole day I couldn't stop thinking about Steph. I mean constantly. So when I finally got online I was so happy to finally talk to her. I told her about my day and after that, I tried my best to make her feel special. I hope it worked. I didn't want 11:00 to come, she always has to go at 11:00. I hate all clocks that contain 11:00. It's the most depressing part of my day, since my Cutie is taken away from me at that time. I usually go to bed right when she leaves, then dream about her all night. That doesn't sound like a bad idea. I think I'll go dream about the love of my life now, see you tomorrow when I'll write more about the girl I love.

I love you, Stephanie."

Steph was worried about me so she's sending me to bed. She was so worried about me... I'm sorry, hun. Thank you for being here for me once again. I can always count on you to take care of me.

Thanks.. I love you so much."

"event","Today in school, I was learning about some neat stuff in physics, when the principal announced that they recently received a bomb threat. Yeah. So we evacuated the building and went to the football field. Me and Dontel walked around a bit and talked to a few people. Then we had to go in way too fast. I doubt they had time to check the whole building for bombs. So at that point me and Dontel dismissed ourselves, went home, and I witnessed Dontel's first mistake of many.

He challenged me to a match in Perfect Dark. After completely destroying him in a final score of 20 to 1, he made his next mistake.

He actually had the guts to say he can beat me in Smash Brothers Melee. 

I laughed at first, then saw he was serious. I put the game in, gave him two level nine (highest difficulty) computer partners in a team against me. Three on one. After destroying him in record time, without losing even one life, he made one last mistake.

He claimed he could beat me in Halo. The very game I introduced him to and trained him in. Unfortunately I don't own Halo anymore, but I have a sudden urge to buy it again so I can embarrass him once again. 

Dontel loves to talk shit, even when he sucks at a game. So when I completely decimate him in a game, he usually shuts up about that game for a while.

Dontel has no idea who he's picking these fights with. If anyone has any last words to say to him, say them now. He's going to be hurting pretty bad with all the claims he's been making about his skill in games."

Steph, you're amazing.
When I'm in a bad mood, you can instantly cheer me up, when I'm depressed over something, you're always right there for me. You make me feel important, special, or like I have a purpose. 
I'm always thinking about you every moment of every day, and I couldn't be happier. You're constantly on my mind, even when I sleep. At night, I have all these dreams about you, and how things could be in the future.
Without you my days would be cold and dark. I can't imagine life without you now that I know how great it is.
I always think about how lucky I am to have met someone like you. I think about it every day. 
I didn't know what love was before I met you. I thought I did, but you've shown me how good it feels. I've never felt the way I feel about you. There are lots of feelings you've shown me that I never felt before. You're the most amazing person I've ever met... 
I hope we can be together forever, Steph. I love you with all my heart and soul."

Post a memory of me in the comments. It can be anything you want. Then, post this to your journal and see what people remember of you.

So have fun with this, guys.

P.S. I love you, Steph."

"event","<P>I almost forgot, Dontel got us a visit from the cops on saturday.</P>
<P>He decided to be ""cool"" and scream ""He's got a gun!"" out my window. So an hour or so later the cops showed up and asked us about it. We blamed it on the videogames we were playing, so they laughed and left us alone. So after they left I punched the hell out of Dontel and he wouldn't get over the fact that the cops came.</P>
<P>Then there were ninja fights.</P>"

"event","<P>Okay, so I was having this really strange dream last night. </P>
<P>Me and Dontel were in school, and we came across a wing in the school that we've never seen before. It was abandoned, and full of kids skipping class. So we go down there, there's gambling, people riding bikes, skateboarding, playing arcade games, you name it. </P>
<P>So me and Dontel get to the end of this wing where there's a garage door leading outside, when suddenly from down the hall we came from we see a hooked up white car jump over a fence. In the hall, yeah...</P>
<P>On the hood in shiny letters, was written ""Gangsta lyfe"", and who comes out of the car? None other than this old lady who teaches the special ed classes at school. What the hell?</P>
<P>Me and Dontel looked at the car, then I woke up. But I can tell you this; This car was <EM>hooked up! </EM></P>
<P>So I woke up, and my day commenced.</P>
<P>I played some Metal Gear Solid, beat it twice, got both endings, then went with my bro &nbsp;to get roses and cards for my ma for mothers day. I got a pepsi and some Doritos, then went home and played some more Metal gear. I came online, and here I am. Now I'm waiting for my Cutie to get online so I can be all extra happy and stuff.</P>"

People wanted me to have one, so I gave in and got one. Then my sister was nice enough to make it not suck. 

So anyway, I'll write in this from time to time if I remember to do so.

"event","I was grounded from the computer for a little bit, my brother and I got in a tiff over the use of lego parts from a spaceship my friend David built. Man, my mom was livid!

But a very exciting thing has happened to me, I learned how to make easy mac! My mom still wont let me use the stove because of a SMALL fire i created last year, so now i can still enjoy my favorite snack!

Thats all for now!

"event","Hi Everyone! Sorry for the lack of updating my LJ, but sadly my computer was struck by  lightning. Well, not actually my computer, but an adjacent line that was hooked up to it. Geez was it every tough getting it repaired! My brother had to take it into the computer shop because my mom wouldn't! So he had to ride his bike! It was hard for him to peddal all that way carrying a computer! But he did it!

Well in other news: 
I saw my second favortie cousin at 7-11 today, I was getting a slurpee to go with my 5.55 hot n ready pizza from little ceasers. I decided on an all mountain dew slurpee. Then my cousin came in and he told me that the mountain dew would shrink my testicles. I got real worried so then my brother told me he was just kidding so i didn't worry anymore. Only he didn't say Testicles. He used a different word that i like to think of as ""politically incorrect"". 

That's all for today!

"event","OH man! I would just like 2 give a special thank you to all of you whom added myself to your livejournal user friend lists. it really means a lot to me.
today I got a rash and had to sleep on a plastic couch. my mom says it was from something I ate and she took me to the doc who gave me a shot of benadryl in my bottom. a little pinch but not bad.
also, I urinated today and it came out sideways. i was a little shocked at first, but it straightened out, so i figured i am ok. has this happened to anyone before? i think my brother had that problem once but I'm not sure. he tends to get touchy about his medical problems.

your kindness is greatly appreciated,
-Marty."

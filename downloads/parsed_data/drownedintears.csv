"event","So I've done about 186 takes in the past few days on one song that I have been rigorously working on, and yet I get this feeling that I should scrap it.  It sounds way too rough, and it is still missing the bridge and the lyrics I wrote for it are way too fucking long.  I don't know what I'll do.  I've already shortened the lyrics, I'm having trouble putting it to song now though.  Ahhh I am exhausted."

I like this girl, she tells me she likes me.  She has this irresistible little southern accent that drives me absolutely nuts.  She's smart and beautiful of course, and she's driven and has goals in life.  Though, I'm scared someone else will win her heart before I do.  I just need to get out of Iraq.  I need to LIVE.  Being forgotten is my deepest darkest fear out here.  Lately it feels like my fears have manifested.."

"event","I'm surprised that it never crossed my mind to delete this thing.  I mean shit, it used to be my little place to bitch about my life.  I've changed a whole lot in 4 years, and I don't know if they were good changes, but I used to love who I was.  Now I'm half way through my army enlistment, in Iraq sweating my balls off(and I know it's only getting worse), risking my fucking life, and constantly wishing I was living a normal, ideal life.  I've seen a whole lot that the world has to offer, and quite frankly I'm not impressed.  The world truly is a fucked up place and in order to maintain a certain sense of well-being and sanity, in essence, you have to seclude yourself and live in your tiny little bubble or box.  I don't know what the meaning of life is, and I don't think I ever will.  I don't even know if I give a fuck.  All I want is to live a normal life again, and thats all I ever think about, all day long, everyday.  I'm 1/3rd of the way done with my grand iraqi vacation!

The point is I want to just fucking smoke a fucking fatty blunt of some of the finest dankest greenery and blow it in your faces.  Werd life, one love, I'm out."

"event","so this is pretty much my last weekend in the states, therefore i decided to get extra crazy.
last night we accidentally broke a 12 pack, i tried to pick up the glass with my hands, killed a bottle and a quarter of another bottle of jagermeister, and locked my self out of my room...twice.

this is basically how it happened.

1.  Andy came and got me after work.  I had slept since 1300 and he came around 1800.  I was extremely hungry (as always)

2.  We went to his room and smoked a lot of cigarettes.  He says lets get ""SHITTY""

3.  A large grin falls upon my face.

4.  Neither of us have cars (cause I dropped mine off in Tucson) so we ask somebody that walks by us for a ride.  We say we will give him a brew.

5.  We go to the shopette and we get a 12 pack of Heineken and a large bottle of Jager.  I buy it with Andy's credit card.

6.  I forgot to purchase cigarettes.  I am angry, but much more enthusiastic to sap the liq.

7.  We go to Andy's room and the dude that gave us a ride ""Whitzel"" was wearing an Atreyu shirt.

8.  We play Bioshock and I slam a few beers down.  I am not yet buzzed.  I decide it is ""jagertime!""

9.  Whitzel starts talking about his ability to play an instrument called the bass guitar.  I look at the atreyu shirt and laugh to myself.  I take them to my room and I show Whitzel how I shred.  I tell him Atreyu sucks so many times and I was starting to become rather furious because he says ""it's a matter of opinion.  I throw my phone on the ground.  It shatters and explodes.  We all laugh.

10.  I chug the jager.  By this time I am taking multiple chugs.  I show him what real music is.

11.  I decide to go to Matt (Bald Eagles) room.  He answers and he smells like Jameson whiskey.  He sounds like he is drunker than I am.  With jager in hand I start to invite myself in but a female NCO stops me and asks me if I know what jager is used for in Germany.  I tell her ""to get crunkalunk""  she says yeah that too but it is used to settle your stomachs after you eat large meals.  I am rather intrigued by this statement.

12.  I tell her that coca-cola used to have cocaine in it.  She tells me Dr. Pepper used to do something too but by this time the jager has been 86'd into my stomach.  I am dizzy, and it feels quite grand.  I go into Matt's room finally and accidentally knock over multiple items.  (including his drink)  I tell him i am sorry and I hug him.  I ask him if he has my back in Iraq.  He says he does.  He asks me if I have his.  You get the idea.

13.  I steal his phone and start talking to the girl that he called.  I ask her if she is hot.  She tells me to inquire with Matt.  I ask whats your name along with a bunch of slurry words.  She hangs up on me.  I walk around the outside of the barracks being friendly and saying Hi to people.  Some people are cool with it but a large man wearing a bright green shirt decides to be coercive with me.  I tell him to fuck off.

14.  Whitzel tells us he has more jager.  I re-con it.  It is a lot of trouble trying to get it but the pot of gold was mine and not the leprechauns.  I chug it and don't share with my friends.  Friends get angry.  They say more liquor now.  We get into the batmobile and take off at a high rate of speed.  We go inside the shopette.

15.  I realize how bad my munchies are and start grabbing an outstanding amount of frozen snacks/foods.  I kept yelling that I need tacos or I will not be able to go on in life.  The line in the shopette was about 15-20 customers long.  We argue about which beer to get.  I argue with customers in line about which beer is better.  My fist clenches to this one dude but I quickly realize I am in a bad situation.  I release my tension.  I grab more Heinekens.  The blond girl in front of me thought I was funny.  She was cute.  I tell her the band that is on her shirt sucks terribly.  She doesn't think I am funny anymore.  I have a habit of ruining things especially with the female persuasion.  I ruin more things during the night.  Let's see here....

16.  We go to my room. I get to my door and I try to get my food from him.  Somehow the beers flew out of the bag and box and shattered at my door step.  I start sucking beer off the ground as if I am desperate.  My friend gets pissed and goes to his room.  I follow, but only to get a mop.  I go into the cleaning closet and as i grab two mops the neon halogen light comes crashing down in front of me.  Did I do something to make it fall?  I have absolutely no idea.

17.  As my friend tries to get into his room 4 more beers break.  Wow we are all entirely too drunk.  I goto my room but realize I locked myself out.  I have a french bread pizza in the microwave that was set for 25 minutes.  It is not funny to me anymore.  I pound on my neighbors door.  He answers in his underwear and tells me I am drunk.  I go through his window and through mine to get to my room.  I break my window screen as I have no patience for extra bullshit.  I smell burning food.  I turn the microwave off and read the numbers 13:16 left on the timer.  I still eat one of the burnt foods.  I go outside to mop the mess.  I lock myself out again.  My finger is bleeding like crazy because i tried to pick up glass with my hands.  I knock on Jefferies door again and he answers.  I ask him for a metal clothes hanger.  He and his room mate both tell me  no.  my finger is bleeding like crazy.  I bleed on him.  I squeeze my finger and blood squirts at whatever I point it at.  I am intrigued again.  I get back in my room and just sweep the glass into my room.  I go back to Andy's room.

18.  He and Whitzel are eating taquitos.  I love taquitos.  I take taquitos.  And a cigarette.

19.  I go back to my room and smoke a cigarette.  I CRASH.  Successful Friday indeed.

Fin."

I'll get the night off
You'll get the chance to take the world apart and figure out how it works
Don't let me know what you find out
I need a car
You need a guide
Who needs a map
If I don't die or worse I'm gonna need a nap
At best I'll be asleep when you get back
I wanna see it when you find out what comets, stars, and moons are all about
I wanna see their faces turn to backs of heads and slowly get smaller
I wanna see it now 

I want specifics on the general idea
I wanna think what I should know
Want you to do me what to show
I wanna see movies of my dreams

I wanna see it when you get stoned on a cloudy breezy desert afternoon
I wanna see it untame itself and break its owner
I wanna see it now"

"event","This past week has seen a plethora of ""lasts.""&nbsp; Last full day, last lunch with Ciccihni (sp?,) last time I'll see half of these people ever again, etc....&nbsp; Of course these lasts aren't for me, but for almost all of my friends and peoples I associated with for three years, the seniors.&nbsp; I'm gonna miss them a lot, but I haven't really gotten that one moment where it really hits me, and when it does it will be really bad.

I went to prom on Friday.&nbsp; All those cheesy 80's and 90's teen movies that we all grew up watching made me think prom was going to be different from what it really was to most of the people I shared it with; just another dance.&nbsp; I enjoyed myself and I hope Lily did as well, but it didn't come close to what Hollywood has been portraying to us all along... maybe it was the lack of sand for a place that advertised with the word ""surf"" in their title.&nbsp; Anyway, I had fun and I guess I can always look forward to next year.

I really wanted to go to the Detroit Electronic Music Festival this weekend, but I think the people I planned on going with ditched me.&nbsp; I need to find friends with an appreciation for techno; maybe I will put out a wanted add:

White male (17), in a relationship, looking for friendship (M/F).&nbsp; Must enjoy the electronic music scene and adventure.

"event","I did not expect to be coming home listening to Stars' opener more than them the day after (although I have listened to them a lot as well.)&nbsp; Their name- his name- is Martin Royle (www.myspace.com/martinroylemusic) and he's pretty good.&nbsp; He's kinda goofy pop.&nbsp; It's almost as if it a joke.&nbsp; I like two of his songs (it seems like he only has three,) but my favorite is 'sex with the ex'.&nbsp; Partly because of the female voice that sang the counter-melody that stood in front of me for part of the Stars set, and partly because it's really catchy.&nbsp; My iTunes says I've only listened to this song 3 times because I've restarted the song right after they finish so I can hear it again.

Stars was pretty good.&nbsp; Some parts were awkward standing and just... standing, all of us lightly singing pieces of the lyrics that we know under our breath.&nbsp; And then there were the really great parts where we did care how loud we sang along with them.&nbsp; We were kinda in a bad spot acousticly (We were underneath a balcony on stage right leaning against the window,) but apart from that the atmosphere was good.&nbsp; I was disappointed that they didn't play Barricade, which is about two gay football hooligans.&nbsp; To say the least it has a lot of football(soccer) references that I find superb.&nbsp; Apart from that they played all the really good songs that I could sing along with.

The best part of the night would have to be the drive home.&nbsp; Nick [Canu] lay across my back seat, while we all took turns putting on something that we all knew the words to, so we sing it at the top of our lungs with the stereo that was equally loud.&nbsp; It was a good drive.

Looking through my iPod right now, I realized I need something new.&nbsp; The things I have just don't do it for me anymore.&nbsp; I need something inspiring or different.&nbsp; I have to go looking... or just experiment with anything and everything on Lily's ipod.

Spring break is over and I have done nothing I said I wanted to do apart from rest.&nbsp; I didn't finish a single book (in fact I started another which I will probably finish before the others.&nbsp; It's called 'Blue Covenant'.&nbsp; It's about the global water crises.&nbsp; Read it.)&nbsp; I didn't do any conditioning like I told myself.&nbsp; And I really never got settled into this break.&nbsp; The weather was nice, partly, and I did get to spend time with my sister up at Alma for a day.&nbsp; I guess it wasn't too bad.&nbsp; I mean, I can deal with everybody having a tan and being pale.

I must stop writing so I can sleep.

"event","I've come to the conclusion that a clean house is a lonely one.&nbsp; I don't know why, but every time I clean my house I just have to get out of it.&nbsp; I tried to go to the YMCA, but for some reason its closed (so I did donuts in the snow in their parking lot.)&nbsp; I tried to escape the feeling by riding the stationary bike in the basement, but it doesn't do what I expect it to be doing.&nbsp; I tried just doing push ups and the general solitary activity of doing core strengthening exercises, but alas, nothing has worked.

I think it may be the isolationism I feel within a clean house.&nbsp; It kinda eases my mind having controlled clutter around me when I work, but now I just can't concentrate and a TV doesn't do me any good either.&nbsp; It always feels like I'm in a different room after I clean my bedroom.&nbsp; Making my bed is such a momentous occasion that when it does happen it throws me off so much.&nbsp; 

Time goes by incredibly slow, while going fast at the same time.&nbsp; I feel like I should be going snowboarding tomorrow, but Hayden's not home so I can't.&nbsp; I have to go to this fund-raiser for MUN at Barnes and Nobles that I probably won't remember.&nbsp; I do have three post-it notes set up strategically around my house to remind me.

There's a Stars concert next saturday and I really want to go, but that means I need to order tickets like now, so I should go do that."

I have plans to read a lot too.&nbsp; I want to finish/start at least half of these books:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Pedagogy of the Oppressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Ismael

"event","There are very few times in my life where I have been apart of something so special that I know it will never happen again.

There are only a few that I can think of, for example my second year of leadership and the German trip this summer.&nbsp; The emotions and friendships shared and developed during those collective three weeks have helped me to know who I am and what I value.

I think this weekend at MSUMUN was another such event that everything just aligned and became clearer to me.&nbsp; I caught myself multiple times during the weekend thinking about what this means to the people around me, especially the seniors, for this was their last conference.&nbsp; I would hope that certain seniors (nick canu, ashley, and melaney) remember their last conference of their highschool career in a positive light, because they, as well gabi and kevin, have made a lasting impression on me.

It started with simple beginnings on Friday, nobody else could join us because we didn't want to pay 15% gratuities on our meal at T.G.I. Fridays, but it evolved into our last meal together just rotating the desserts around the table, no one was without a smile and it occured to me that never again will this moment happen.&nbsp; Never will we be able to reproduce this moment, no matter how much we may speak of it or attempt to re-enact it.&nbsp; Never will the friendship between the six of us will be the same.&nbsp; Never will all of us be living in that moment together.

I'm not sure whether I should look back on this moment with nostalgic excitement or with some sort of sad ending titled to it.&nbsp; What evoked emotion in me was realizing that I made an impact on a person or group of friend's lives.&nbsp; 

I guess all these feelings and thoughts have been building in me for a while and I'm just having a hard time articulating what I'm feeling inside into words.&nbsp; I need to think, or maybe stop thinking and just do what I feel.


I think I may be a social being, while having qualities of a wallflower."

"event","Let me just start by saying that Kwame is amazing.&nbsp; He's such a bad politician, he's good.&nbsp; The snipits I saw from his ""state of the city"" address that was held at the fox theatre (which was quite fitting for the content that was being spewed out of his mouth.)&nbsp; He was trying to do the whole political thing of talking with your hands (kinda like Obama with a pointed fist), but it didn't work.&nbsp; It came off as incredibly cheap and staged, like everything he's done.&nbsp; To me it seems that his debauchery has done the opposite to the political climate in Detroit than I previously had thought.&nbsp; I thought that the people of Detroit would not care and have lower turnout ratings as well as having a preconceived cynicism towards all city positions, but, from what I can see of from news, it has energized people to participate and share their voice.<br /><br />The other day a string of thoughts led me down a weird path to, what I think is, a strange idea.&nbsp; This idea is that we are no better off now than we were during the cold war.&nbsp; We are still teetering on an edge of a world war and nothing can really stop all the factors.&nbsp; These factors are:<br /><blockquote><ul><li>The puppet democracy in Russia.&nbsp; Everybody knows that Putin is controlling the Prime Minister (or is it the president.)&nbsp; It is blatantly obvious that this is happening.&nbsp; Another&nbsp; sutlety of the Russian democracy that generally goes unnoticed (I myself don't actually know a lot about this but it's true) is the fact that there are government officials that were part of the KGB.&nbsp; Communist running a democracy??? nooo...</li><li>Russia has sights of being the kind of superpower it once was.</li><li>Developing countries (china, india, and more minor ones) seeking to become major powers.&nbsp; These aspirations are similar to Russia's.</li><li>Nuclear weapons.&nbsp; Simply put, they're big and deadly.&nbsp; Although the threat of Rus. vs. U.S. war is non-existent now, there is still conflicts with nuclear weapons on either side of the war line.&nbsp; This is especially scary when you talk about the Pak-Indo-Chinese relations.</li><li>The U.S. undermining the United Nations.&nbsp; Usually, when you want to be diplomatic, you ask people what they think about going into a country that doesn't deserve to be torn apart and then actually respect their choice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the U.S. has gotten used to being the only world power for a good 15-20 years, so the whole diplomacy thing is lost to our leaders.&nbsp; Even though we could completely level a single country, doesn't mean we do it without support from the majority of the global community.&nbsp; In doing so, they completely undermined the legitimacy of the United Nations, a body that the U.S. helped form.</li><li>Trouble in the Balkans.&nbsp; Okay, so this is a weak one, but WWI was directly caused by problems in the Balkans.&nbsp; Kosovo could be a key ingredient.</li><li>The general dislike towards the U.S. from the people around the world and our disingenuine attempt to make nice with them... or care.<br /></li><li>OIL!</li><li>Countries, such as China and India, are in a similar developmental stage that Europe was in economically/industrially as well as socially(not so sure about this one)</li><li>The U.S.'s lack of understanding that their will be, if there isn't already, other ""superpower"" countries.&nbsp; How our policy makers react to this will be a key factor.</li><li>The economy- if everything goes belly up in the U.S., then what happen?&nbsp; What will happen is the other big markets in the world will crash like dominoes, leaving the whole world screwed... and angry.</li><li>There are more that I can't remember now.</li></ul></blockquote><br />The main thing I was wondering is if we are really that much more sophisticated culture or society than we were 60-80 years ago?&nbsp; We still have turmoil, we have deadlier weapons, and we have the world getting smaller.&nbsp; I don't know where these thoughts are going, but I'm trying to explain to myself what I think as well.<br /><br />What do you think?"

"event","Clovis, my wonderful brother that happens to be French and from a different mother and father, just left me a message and told be that my favorite French band that he introduced to me is coming to Dearborn!&nbsp; I am utterly excited about this.&nbsp; Clovis is my favorite.&nbsp; For one he is French, and weirdly encompasses everything you would think a French man would have while still being nothing like a stereotypical Frenchie.&nbsp; He's great.&nbsp; Well I know what I'm doing on April 17 at 8 Pm... going to rock my brains out with ska, reggea, punk, and a little pure French music too.

On a completely different note,

Today and yesterday were strange and made me conclude that somehow I'm strangely fixated on Cleveland, while still loathing it.&nbsp; I was supposed to have a College Showcase Soccer tournament, but with about a foot and a half of snow on the ground and still more coming, they canceled the whole thing.&nbsp; There was nothing else to do than get on the express way and go home.&nbsp; On the way home through a blizzard we got backed up in an accident that involved a semi and a lot of cars.&nbsp; We were sitting there for about two and a half hours.&nbsp; I finished some homework and played a little pick up game in the blizzard with my teammates that just happened to be in the car right next to me.&nbsp; 

Do you ever look back on something and see what the direct result of your actions leads to something unexpected?&nbsp; Well, I did today when we were starting to move.&nbsp; Earlier in the blizzard my dad was going to get gas, but he drove the wrong way through the rest stop and ended up past the gas station.&nbsp; This probably used up two or three minutes going at the pace we were going.&nbsp; The accident ahead of us was not close enough for us to see, but far enough for me to think that if we hadn't stopped at that rest station we would have been in the accident.&nbsp; I had the same feeling when we were just behind a accident on our way to Florida during spring break.&nbsp; My mom was thinking about speeding up and passing a few semis just when like three semi's up one had rolled over and hit a few cars.&nbsp; 

Its strange to think that I have avoided serious chances of injury for minor things like missing a driveway.&nbsp; If anything, I have 5 more lives left after using two for cars and two more for my health complications as a baby.&nbsp; Actually when you add the times when I should have hurt or done serious damage to my head while snowboarding, i really should be down to at least 3. I think trends show that I will get hurt pretty badly soon.&nbsp; Watch out.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was a snowday.&nbsp; The snow itself was not very deep, probably not even 6 inches, but you don't hear me complaining.&nbsp; After I woke up at 5 a.m. and found that I was not supposed to go to school today I quickly closed my books (I was doing homework because I went to bed early) and went to bed until about 9.&nbsp; Today was beautiful!&nbsp; Never does it snow here at night and then have not a cloud in the sky the next morning.&nbsp; If I was extremely narrow minded I would have grabbed my stuff and made it over to Pine Knob in about 30 minutes to get some fresh tracks.&nbsp; But, alas, I opted to ""study"" this morning.&nbsp; This studying consisted of sitting at my desk and staring at a half finished sentence of a manuscript which I have just finished now.&nbsp; I have not studied for the two tests I have tomorrow and haven't finished my physics homework either.&nbsp; On a positive note I e-mailed another college coach and received a message back from him and I got to have my ass handed to me, again, in another spinning class with the Blazers.&nbsp; I may keep doing the spinning class because it's a good substitute for not doing track this year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lily left for 4 days today.&nbsp; She will be traveling with the choir to Nashville and Memphis.&nbsp; Although I'm going to miss her it may help me concentrate on the fact that I have to study for the ACT next teusday.&nbsp; To be honest, the fact that she is leaving will not change my schedule this weekend because I have a India meeting after school and a band concert as well as soccer practice tomorrow and then I'm in Cleveland all weekend for a soccer showcase tournament, so maybe I won't study for the ACT.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now I'm off to study for pub. speaking and physics.&nbsp; Then, if I stay awake I'll do my India delegation papers, which I haven't started and they must be uploaded to the MSUMUN site by Saturday.&nbsp; I much preferred the preparation for UMMUN, just show up with them in your hands and you're good.&nbsp; I'm completely unprepared and have been making a lackluster head delegate.&nbsp; I just had a meeting with the majority of my delegation Teusday and everybody went crazy.&nbsp; I guess this is going to happen until next year when I have a fresh start and people may respect me more.&nbsp; Melanie really wants me to be an officer.&nbsp; She wants me to do her job and have Gabi do Zach's job.&nbsp; I think this would be putting a lot of pressure and responsibility on two second year MUNers, but if it's gonna be anyone of us, I think it would be more productive if it was us.

"event","This is my first entry since 9th grade.&nbsp; Recently Lily was telling me about her livejournal and I was intrigued by rekindling my lost livejournal voice.&nbsp; My motives have changed for having a livejournal. Before it was just to find popularity from other people by having them comment on my journal.&nbsp; Now I hope to just write in this mostly unread piece to serve as another outlet of my mind (like I don't have enough.)

As of right now I'm swamped in school work and extra carricular's.&nbsp; I like to keep busy, but my current situation is leaving almost no time for me to have a wind down time, although I got some much needed sleep as well as time with Lily last night.&nbsp; The Global Trade Mission I just finished yesterday morning was not a success and not exactly a failure.&nbsp; The idea of the Mission, get highschool students to think globally and give them knowledge to the global economy, is great, but the implementation of the plan was a bit lack luster.&nbsp; I couldn't get over the fact that we were just thrown into a team of people we had never met before and were suddenly supposed to make a business plan to introduce something into the global economy and have it succeed.&nbsp; Also, many people, like myself, didn't fully understand what the creators of the program wanted from us.&nbsp; Prior knowledge would have been great.

In the next two weeks I will most likely decide what the next four years of my life will look like.&nbsp; First I have a soccer tournament specifically designed for college scouts to come and take a look at players and start recruitment.&nbsp; Then the week after that I have the ACT which I haven't been studying for, so it should be really good.&nbsp; I'm really nervous about both because I know I haven't been focusing enough of my energy on either getting my name out to colleges I want to go to or studying for the damn thing that will determine my life.

Speaking of determining my life, I may have realized what I want to do.&nbsp; I realized last night that almost everything I'm doing and interested in revolves around the environment and making it better and changing it for the better.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure what sub genre I want to be associated with in terms of the environment (you know the social, political, scientifical, or business aspect of it), but I know I want to do something.&nbsp; The great thing is that I can choose what I want to do within the environmental field, whether it be any of the just mentioned areas of work.&nbsp; I'm gonna have to do some research on what colleges are best for it, but I'm willing to do this.

I've just wasted about and hour and a half of homework time between this and other parts of the interweb, so I must stop writing.&nbsp; I hope from now on this will be a regular edition to my days, or weeks."

I wont say anything about that stuff dont really feel like going into great detail about two weeks ago.
I got back from super-saturday which was better than i thought it would be. It was just painting and using powertools. Not to mention playing around in the glass hall with paper balls with max and andrew for like an hour. The not working part was fun. That was pretty much all day. Then we just sat around in the back of the auditorium for an hour, that was relaxing. We also went up to taco bell which was cold on the way there, we had to walk. It was a good lunch.
Now I'm off to paint this stool that's gonna look really cool when I'm done with it, hopefully. Then I'm off to this dinner thing for somebody."

<br>
So&nbsp; I just got back from the football game with matt, my sister,
and her friend kayla.&nbsp; We won 14-13.&nbsp; I have to say that the
car ride their and back was more entertaining than the football game,
even though sitting with the pep band is kinda fun i guess.&nbsp; So ya
i think that that means we are 3-0, if im not mistaken.&nbsp; I wonder
how it is until we loose, like usual.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So wendsday was my first soccer game with kimball. We got owned 0-4.
Not too bad seeing as it was our first time playing against a different
team in a game situation. We will get better, not too worried about
that.<br>
<br>
So tommorow is Tag Days, so if you feel like making fun of me for being
in marching band come to Blockbuster on Woodward and Catalpa from 6-9
Pm to keep me company.&nbsp; Ya so come and 'Support the Kimball Band
Boosters'.&nbsp; <br>
Thats all i have to say tonight so I think i might go do something else.&nbsp; Goodbye and Goodnight...<br>"

"event","Ok so my last entry was what?...teusday? ok so anyway if i can remember i will tell you about the last three days...

Wensday- went to the National Arab American museum...you know to see my culture and all that good stuff. I liked it a lot but I was rushed through the museum cause we got there around 4:30 and it closed at 6 and the women i went with found it necessary that we visit the gift shop right at the begining.  On top of the museum i got to eat the greatest food in the world...Lebenesse(sp) food! OMG i love food...Arabic food especially and to be even more specific i love hummous with lamb...
When i was in the gift shop i was eyeing the ""learn how to write in Arabic book""...Damn is that language convusing. If i remember correctly they only have two vowels and there is a short sound and a long sound for each. and then there are all these confusing dots over the words that changed the sound too...much harder than German.

Thursday- Marching Band practice...stupid...i dont like it...

Friday(today)- Went to madagascar the movie with my sister and my mom...didnt like it that much...not the best movie ive seen... Then went to a birthday party for Brandon Ward...It was fun, i was like the youngest kid there cause all of his friends are like senoirs or junoirs and well im not even a freshman yet... Then i was supposed to go to another getogether where Amanda's friend was having a movie night but our parents didnt feel like taking us...

Tommorow- going to this bbq thats my dads co-workers:(...see the thing is my dad works with all these asians that are really really smart and stuff but cannot speak english like we do so its kinda hard to understand them at sometimes. I geuss if anybody feels like saving me they could call me tomorow/today(your probably reading this on saturday) and see if i can hang-out.

Sunday- supposed to go up north to see fireworks and hang out in town 

wow i kinda wrote a lot... i didnt even mean to write alot...o well"

stuff, for when I go counsel this summer(hopefully), with Amanda and<br>
her friend Liz. It was actually really fun. We walked down the Iles<br>
scaring people. Liz kept on singing ""the roof the roof the roof is on<br>

talking, your supposed to think about the day and what happened and
things like that. They usually have a theme like respect or everybody

I just spent the most amazing week at camp...I mean udescibably great. I went to Leadership Camp 2005 at VBYC and I learned so much stuff about myself...One of the clinics was ""who are you?"". That was my favorite clinic cause i realized what the point was that the speaker was trying to get across and the 'me' at camp is probably who 'I' really am.  

OK right now im just going to write stuff that I think is worth writing cause it was so awsome their and that i need to go back:
1) 1,2 step...greatest thing at camp...Brad and I...ya and the other ppl too, whoever they were. 
2) Log-my planning group it was so much fun. Dana and I got all the ""What ifs?' and that was fun just walking around camp asking people random questions...in the credits im 'Mr. What If'
3) New friends... I met some very cool people their along with seeing old ones 
4) Counseling- I probably will get to become a counselor this summer and I at least go back once or twice.
5) The meals
6) My cabin
7) Campfire...so many funny memories
8) Chucky and Ethyl 
9) The six sprained ankels('kankel' lol)
10) Fridays party
11) Having fun
12) Being with great people all the time.


I will probably remember more later...so i'll just edit it or if you remember something just leave a comment.


EDIT-----I just made my back round a picture of cabin row(if you wanna check it out) the one directly on your left is the cabin i just stayed in. This was not taken during my week"

This week(half of a week) has been really slow. I think just the transition from D.C. to normal school has been weird for me.  Ummm. lets see saturday and sunday i just slept, monday- idk i guess it was cold outside and i went out and played soccer instead of homework. Teusday- soccer practice, 
today was finally warmer. Now im stuck trying to write a paragraph or two why i would like to go to this one camp. I think its kinda stupid cause its not like they dont have enough room in the camp to have me come. Plus im paying them, what do they care if i can write a paragraph..."

"event","Ya so whoever said ""update TOOLBAG"" lol here it is:
Thursday- soccer practice, played against the girl Birmingham Blazers. We tied 0-0. They were actually really good. Plus it was hard to concentrate on playing soccer cause everytime i went in to get a ball i would think that i might hurt them.
friday- went and visited my uncle who is in town from Palm Springs. lol he is so weird and funny at the same time. Then i had a soccer game, we lost 6-2, i didnt score any goals, it was against this all seventh grade team which sucks cause we lost to seventh graders.
So today was pretty awsome. Had a soccer game against Vardar. three words: very hard team. We only lost by 4, though we had some soft goals. In the first half Billy Adams, our goalkeeper, probably played the best half of soccer from a goaly i've seen in a long time. any way our coach was like (in a very strong welsh accent) ""greg you got a good find there. Bills a really good keeper.""  lol its the finger saves... boosts your self esteem. Second half we had a lot of weak goals. one went like under Bills arm, and the there was a PK, penalty kick. and obviously friggin vardar never misses. I got into this verbal fight with this one guy from Kenya i think. He said i punched him in the face lol. If i did i would have made it look so obvious and i would have at least tried to draw some blood.
Right now im supposed to be at this all night soccer marathon at the dome but im tired as hell!
Tommorow im going to this gay play that my parents are making me go to at the University of Michiganl. and then probably over to see my uncle again. 

there TOOLBAG i covered all the bases so you dont have to comment all the time about im not updating. and i dont think im gonna update a whole lot now...

I think my coach saw how good i can be in that practice. I might not have to play defense all the time! Then i went to my indoor soccer game. I think we literally beat them 20-2. Maybe more. They were so bad the goalie would try to dribble it all the way up and at least three people on our team(me included) just took the ball from hit and shot like a half court shot. lol. Out of the 9 players that were there 7 players scored and everybody that did score got two or more. I think i got 4. Lol the refs actually told our coach(Mr. Shand) to go easy on them and that he thought we were piling on the points to be a bad sport.lol. Then i went home and slept cause i was so frickin' tired after about 3 hours of soccer. Today matt and tom came over. then we went over to matts house and did shit. Ahhh this weather is so nice. I dont want it to get any warmer. Just like this. Probably wont happen cause we live in Michigan and the weather changes every hour."

For those of us whose season has already ended, just some thoughts to prepare for next year. :-)

To prepare for ski season, try these activities before you go to the mountain:

Soak your gloves in water and store them in the freezer after every use.

Fasten a small, wide rubber band around the top half of your head before you go to bed
each night.

If you wear glasses, begin wearing them with glue smeared on the lenses.

Throw away a hundred dollar bill - now.

Find the nearest ice rink and walk across the ice 20 times in your boots carrying
your board and other gear. Pretend you are looking for your car.

Sporadically drop things.

Place a small but angular pebble in your shoes, line them with crushed ice,and then
tighten a C-clamp around your toes.

Buy a new pair of gloves and immediately throw one away.

Secure one of your ankles to a bed post and ask a friend to run into you at high speed.

Go to McDonald's and insist on paying $8.50 for a hamburger. Be sure you are in the
longest line.

Clip a lift ticket to the zipper of your jacket and ride a motorcycle fast enough to
make the ticket lacerate your face.

Drive slowly for five hours - anywhere - as long as it's in a snowstorm and you're
following an 18 wheeler.

Fill a blender with ice, hit the pulse button and let the spray blast your face. Leave
the ice on your face until it melts. Let it drip into your clothes.

Dress up in as many clothes as you can and then proceed to take them off because you
have to go to the bathroom.

Slam your thumb in a car door. Don't go see a doctor.

Repeat all of the above every Saturday and Sunday until it's time for the real thing"

First we went to this one place where he had to deliver some stuff for work. Me and Amanda sat in the car for like 30 minutes just listening to radio. Then we went to downtown Birmingham where we did a number of things. In this one place they were playing some cheap covers of The Beatles songs. They were so messed up and like slow when they were supposed to be fast songs and fast when they were supposed to be slow. Then we did a couple more stuff for his work. Came home did some stuff, watched the MSU and Duke game. And now im writing this. Well thats my first day of break..."

They are very interesting.

Or about arabic food. and seeing as i have no interest in knowing how to prepare food and that i dont know one muhamed or ali, or aunt or uncle from the other im completely lost in the conversation except when everybody is laughing i just laugh too lol.

"event","Today wasnt fun. or at least the night wasnt fun.
First i went over to Bubba's house, hung out with him nick and richard for a while and then went to my soccer game. Ya so in the first half i got knocked down on the ground on my back and i felt this little tingle on the lower left side of my spine...nothing much i'll just run it off, right? Well i was doing that until like 2 minutes left in the game and i probably just moved a little too quick or i got into an ackward position for my back or maybe that dumbass kid who knocked me down hit me again(cant really remember what happened). Any way my back started to hurt pretty bad so i went off and i lay down flat on the ground for the rest of the game. After the game my dad try's to diagnose the problem and he's trying all these weird things to find out whats wrong. He thinks i might be having problems with a disk in my back. Worst case senario for that...surgery and out for about two to three months(not so sure about the recovery time but it will be at least a month). Ya so i dont want that. But i know in the back of my mind there is a very good chance that i might have messed it up. But there are smaller injuries to the disk's in your back that a little therapy can cure. Or if it is very minor and i do something that harms my back i could be crippled for the rest of my life.lol dont want that either. hopefully its not the worst case senario and i just rest a couple days and my backs better. it's kinda weird cause my dad has had a disk problem in his back and he says that it doesnt hurt when you are walking or when you are lying straight on the ground. Now i might not be able to go snowboarding tomorow. Hopefully thats the most of my worries. Omg i want to mess that kid up who did this to me..."

I dont no what im gonna do on saturdays any more :(. O well it'll be spring soon and ill just skateboard with my friends that i go snowboarding with lol. Then after waiting for the longest four hours of my life i went to my soccer game where i must say i had the best time playing soccer since the old days of inferno. Ok so last time i kinda bragged and somebody left a stupid comment about me bragging so **beware im gonna brag about myself cause the next couple of sentences will make me sound so much better than i am** I scored 4 goals and i think i had 1 assist! Now i think that is something crazy cause i never score goals and i mean never. and i also give big ""props"" lol to matt cause he was the one who had three assists to the four goals i scored. When me and matt werent on the feild we were just sitting on the bench making fun of the other team. lol ""shake it off guys, shake it off"", y the hell is he wearing underarmer, its an indoor soccer game?... lol which dude just scored? the kid with the shorts pulled up to his nipples... that kid runs like hes retarted... that ref was so close to me i swear he was gonna kiss me lol.(after matt purposely trys to trip the kid who puts the sweatband in his mouth) ...then right after billy scores he says ""i was just razzing you"" lol. I hope everybody plays third session so we can get more junoir mints, gummy worms, and tons of other candy for doing things like scoring goals and getting a foul and goign in the box lol.  its gonna be so boring playing soccer when i start to play outdoor with my other team(my first game is in two weeks i think). they just dont no how to have a good time like ""buncha guys"" do. well i think i rambled on about my weekend enough...i hope u had a good one too."

Not my best stuff though. Ne who these guys were filming an actual snowboarding movie and they were doing all this crazy stuff like inverted 540's and 720's and crazy stuff like that. I actually saw a guy do a backflip its was so sweet. then i went home and found out that my sister and the kimball drama club got into state finals for there play. fun day. yesterday i slept the whole day pretty much...not much to say about yesterday. o ya i have one thing to say: the stupid grammy people messed up the Beatltes ""Across the Universe"" i was very dissapointed that they didnt have Ringo and Paul, or at least Eric Clapton...stupid popular singers who cant sing one right note if there life depended on

Okay we are all just running around the snow and im sliding on my butt on the rail cause nobodies around so alexa starts to do it on the side on these jimps then she gets on the rail sitting backwards and she stops and im sliding down and i hit her and she falls onto the snow on her butt and lands on the ground and keeps sliding. lol she looked like a todler who was about to cry(she didnt though) she just looks up and starts laughing lol. These kids were like going on the box with one foot in there bindinds and stuff it was sweet. Then i went home and then i went to my soccer game where we lost 7-4 against roysa. We only lost cause there team was more experienced and had playing together a long time and we just put together a group of guys, hence the name 'buncha guys'. o well...very fun day"

lets see on wendsday i went to school did stupid german exams came home 
yesterday i went to school did german exams then after school i had a basketball game which we won and the A team won their first game yesterday against hazel park and then i went home and i was online and i came across a guys livejournal that was ""one and only greg"" so i started to read it and his icon caught my eye cause it was john lennon and then the caption said ""power to the ppl"" and it turns out that this guys name is greg and he likes john lennon so i read more just to see what this guys is like cause this could be me in like 5 10 years u never know. and it was confusing cause hes married but he lives with his parents and he goes to school? how does that work out? im gonna be a freek who lives with his parenst and never sees his wife who lives right next door...my future seems very interesting.
ne ways today i finished up the last of my german exam in school!! finally no more tests in a different language for 3 more marking periods...now all we have to do is those stupid meaps
then after school i had the last basketball practice of the year and it was actually kinda fun for a change then i went over to matts house where i met up with matt alexa and laura. we had a good time for the half an hour that they were there then i left after they left and then pasted out for like a hour and a half and now im typing this

"event","today i went to school and did school work(wow what a surprise) then i went to alexa's and laura's soccer game(not to mention a bunch of other ppl from addams).  It was ok i guess they tied so the did a good job against a travel team...not bad for a housr team.  But i wasnt really paying that much attention to the game.  Then after their game was my game.  We played the same team(but instead of girls playing it was guys), country day, and we lost 5-4.  Even though we lost i was happy to be playing soccer again...with all this cold weather and all this talk of snowboarding i forgot about soccer. lol ya after the game thomas comes up to me and says omg y did i come to this game alexa and laura talked about matt( and a few things that i dont think ppl would enjoy hearing) for an hour straight, lol. then i rushed over to the basketball game at norrup and i got there right as they were ending... and what a surprise we lost again now the A team has zero wins and the B team has two lol.  Then i went home and found out bad news...for the people who know about it i wont be coming to school for wendsday and thursday. 
  and i guess thats it..."

Like the skin of a dying man
Night after night, we pretend its all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel you cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom
Next to the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favorite ex
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch T.V.
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway
Would you like something to eat
Would you like to learn to fly
Would'ya
Would you like to see me try

WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL THE COPS?
DO YOU THINK ITS TIME I STOPPED?
Why are you running away"

And I can't help but ask myself how much
I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer.
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague,
haunting mass appeal.
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
should be the one behind the wheel.

Whatever tomorrow brings,
I'll be there with open arms and open eyes,
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there..I'll be there.

So, if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive?

Just recently, she was taken off of her treatment, because of the level of red blood cells (maybe it was white) in her blood was way to low.

Right now I am half dead because I just woke up, so I cant really remember anything I id over the period of time I have been grounded thus far... If I did anything at all.
So im just gonna talk about the tour.
Kent, Kristina, Ben, and I decided to meet at the ampi-ghetto
I took bens bus to his house, where I met his insane dog, Dakota. I helped him do some yard work so his dad would take us... And after we were done we went on the computer, and graeme confirmed that the rumor that the concert was moved up to 6 PM was true. So, we had to get a new way of getting there, we messaged Kent, who was at Kristinas house. We told him of the tour starting time, and Kristina obtained her dads car for transportation. Brian Pickle and Sean Segarson also came to bens house, and sense Kristina didn't know the way, she followed the black jeep, that Brain and Segarson and (t)Fucker where in. The instatnt we got to a highway there was a traffic jam.... skipping some parts, we got to the concert 40 minutes late, we missed nO ONe and most of Head charge. When Rammstien stared playing ben and I jumped into the floor. In the First song he was playing, he had a black coat on and he had this cyclops  laser eye thing... then he set himself on fire... rammstien had a lot of stuff to do with fire, in this one song, he had a flamethrower on he mouth, an the keyboardist had a squirtgun on his mouth. and they started shooting at each other.  
Then System of a Down Played... they kicked ass... They played these songs...
Jet Pilot
Prison Song
Needles
X
Chop Suey
Toxicity
Sugar
Everyone was singing along with chop suey.... it was the coolest sounding thing ever.
Then Slipknot played a lot of good songs and had a drum solo, that was the sweetest, the platform that the drummer was on lifted up and started rotating sideways... is was coolio."

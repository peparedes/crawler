"event","<p>My neighbor turned a new number so he invited his family to come and celebrate. He realized that half of our road <em>is</em> his family, so he gave up and just invited the whole road. Besides, its easier to keep them from calling the cops on you if they already stopped by and&nbsp;had some alcohol, music, and food (in that order). George Lopez was proven correct in that there were more kegs/24 packs than kids. In fact, some raided Nicolas' closet and I spotted various little Spidermans, Supermans, and Batmans running about with girls in their grass skirts (it was a Hawaiin theme).&nbsp;<br /><br />But the best part of the night followed the almond tequila. For those who have yet to experience its deliciousness, it is amazing. Like the best of tequila and amaretto, pure delight. Double shots passed quickly. And we soon had a very drunk and rowdy group of boys (aged 14-17). My amusement in their lack of control peaked when the cops came and they became paranoid and twisted their baseball caps at an angle in an attempt to hide their faces. Then we finally managed to get them back inside their house. A (the youngest) somehow escapes. He calmly walks back to the party and tries to get more alcohol. The birthday boy nonchalantly says ""hey man, they're looking for you"". Poor A freaks out and breaks into a run through the neighborhood. Normally we would let them run, but we were by a highway with a 70mph speed limit. His cousins and uncles went chasing after him but couldnt catch him. He finally turned himself back around and was trying to run into his house when the birthday boy yelled ""get on the ground!"". A thought it was a cop and dived for the asphalt. We calmly led him back to his porch&nbsp;before some mean-spirited person yelled ""cops!"" again. A took off running across into our lawn when&nbsp;a former high school linebacker tackled him in our begonias. This time, his cousins hog-tied him and carried him back into the house. Lessons learned. What is amazing is that although he couldnt walk in a straight line, he sure as hell could run in one.&nbsp;<br /><br />Otherwise, things are boring. The youngest caught a virus that has spread through the house. My step-sister is havinga&nbsp; baby and we are wondering if we will ever get to actually see the baby since her family doesnt really like us. But karma is a bitch, and for disliking us so very much, the baby is related to us. My step-sister done gone off and got herself pregnant by one of my cousins (its not much of a stretch but imagine the country accent there). And bit by bit i am overcoming my fear of houston traffic which is horrible. &nbsp;</p>"

"event","go figure. i am making certain traditional family members quite happy. i can make migas, caldo de res or pollo, sopa, fideo, most types of meat,&nbsp;potatoes, etc etc etc. I spend most of my afternoon mitigating fights between a four and ten year old (most resulting in ""he is four years old! you do not throw things at him!"" or ""it is not nice to say nanananana to your brother while he is doing his homework"". my mom is starting to think i am better&nbsp;at this&nbsp;than she is (she was an amazing stay at home mom. she used to let us pick blackberries off the fence and mix it in vanilla ice cream. or let us play in teh mud after&nbsp;it rained. hell, she let us play in the rain). and now my stepdad is being spoiled because ocd man that he is, he has gotten accustomed to having&nbsp;the house clean and&nbsp;dinner ready when he comes home. what is truly puzzling to me though is that when i am left to fend for myself and not support&nbsp;others, i suck at this stuff. i go as long as possible without cleaning, and you have to threaten me with buying new (and clean) clothes before i will wash my own. my idea of dinner&nbsp;involved a microwave or a tip. now i flip out if there isnt&nbsp;something green on a plate (salsa verde counts!). so i am just thinking, its weird how i went to college to avoid being a housewife married to some cheating cholo, and now i am one... but without the wife part and the cheating guy part. &nbsp;and some of the happiest moments of my day are picking up the little monster from pre-k and hearing him say ""guess what! me didn't play outside today!"" *pause* ""wait, yeah me did."" or how he loves toys THIS much and not this much, or how he will try to bargain his way into getting to eat ice cream for lunch.

what isnt so great is having people (mainly a very clever yet annoying ten year old) claim that i am not a real adult till i have a boyfriend. ummm... no. or having people very unsubtlely suggest that i should date a certain cop in training. he's a cop for crying out loud!&nbsp;innate fear and distrust of the police aside (which is allowable considering my hometown cops got into a scandal for stealing ten thousand dollars off an illegal immigrant), he is becoming a cop! see, i cant put it aside. what is worse (something is wrong with me, i know) he is the son of a preacher. that doesnt sound too bad but in his family, 'divorce is not an option'. yes i am quoting. since prenups are non-negotiable for me, of course divorce is an option! and a very useful one! sorry, that is my venting. the name came up way too often these past two weeks, and i am starting to grind my teeth at the mere mention. the good news? he is afraid of me
. so we just have to convince some very stubborn mexicans to bugger off.&nbsp;

oh good news! rob zombie made a revision of halloween, wal-mart has moved out hte school supplies ot make way for decorations, and i think i hear a very formerly hyper child snoring in the living room."

"event","<p>I saw a rollie polie outside. Crawling through the very short weeds that tend to grow on central campus. So few parents and visitors see central campus, that I dont think duke even bothers to plant grass. and if they do, they quickly give up on the maintenance of it. But the rolie polie was crawling around surrounded by miniature ants and very tiny spiders. I wanted to watch the ants, but I did not believe that they would re-enact the great battle that thoreau saw. for one, there was only one type of ant and there were very few. so i gave up on that idea, and concentrated on the insect that originally caught my eye. i used to play with them as a child, letting them crawl on my hands, careful not to crush them, and occasionally prodding them to see them curl up into a little ball. i always felt&nbsp;a sort of affection for them, because they always seemed so timid, ready to roll up at the first sign of trouble. like the fetal position. when i was a bit older, i discovered that they ate excretement, so i stopped playing with them. but my own dog used to thing dead things were so fascinating and would roll in dead insects or human excretment that she found around the villa when she managed to escape the apartment. at least i never gave the insects a bath. </p><p>my mom used to say that josh and&nbsp;i were little vampires, that we only got active at nighttime. the temperature outside is reminding me of that. during the winter time, i only want to go outside during the daytime, when there is at least some degree of warmth from the sun and hide out when night falls and the cold is nearly unbearable. summer is different. i hide out during the day time and only seek fresh&nbsp;air during&nbsp;nightfall. remnants of growing up in the south i guess. josh and i would be listless all day long from the heat, and then suddently perk up when the sun went down and it was still&nbsp;warm enough to run around barefoot outside in a shirt and shorts. when we lived at our bisabuelo's we used to climb trees and chill in the shade, cool and far away from any adults who would recruit us into doing chores. or under the porch or the burnt remnants of a house that was behinds our grandpa's. we used to lie down in the dark, with cool dirt and the bodies of an array of cousins around us. until someone saw a&nbsp;dangerous spider or got a nastly scratch from broken glass or rusty nail. one of our favorite places to be was in the kitchen, because that is where we placed the fan. eventually our tia would get tired of having a&nbsp;crowd of loud children in the small kitchen and chase us out with the paleta, or smack our hands as we tried to steal the food she was preparing until our hands were red and we finally gave up.&nbsp;<br /><br />grandpa lived on a corner block surrounded by family. cousins and tias and tios lived in practically every house all around us. as was a scrap yard, railroads, and some yard with huge piles of dirt and gravel. we used to race up those as fast as we could when it was dark enough after all the workers went home and no one would see us to yell. we would race up, and more often slip down, until we were completely covered in dust and dirt and sweat. cuts with dried blood with miniature pebbles embedded within.<br /><br />when we moved to the villa that changed. we had always lived in another town, often surrounded by family. even when we lived in a gang area, we had cousins who lived right behind our apartment and more down the road, so my mom used less control. she let josh and i run through dirt alleys or searching for snakes under fallen tree limbs or rocks, or let us watch chris do a tattoo in his kitchen or see roy evolve into erica. at the villa it wasnt the same. we weren't (or rather i) was not allowed to leave the apartment after dark. people were always outside during the daytime, fanning themselves and gossiping. at night time, the guys joined the females with their beers and blunts. but none of them were family so going outside was not an option. but the villa was pretty big and a good community. that is what central lacks. we aren't a community. no one really sits on a chair outside their apartment, gossiping with their neighbors. it is designed for privacy, not community, and that is exactly what we have. a neighborhood where no one knows their neighbors, and has to make an effort to visit friends even if they live in the same building. i am not asking for mr rogers neighborhood or anything, but i know that when i graduate, i wont miss anyone from my building, and i will only fondly recall spending time with only a handful or residents living here. </p>"

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">This school year has been all about timing. In particular, bad timing. Adjectives are so useful, they provide that nice little twist to make a situation so much clearer. For example, luck. Luck is all great and good, until you realize there are two types of them. So when wishing luck upon someone, be specific. It's tricky like timing in that way. Timing, luck, fortune, fate, all those words that people toss around and immediately think of positive connotations for, almost always have that nice flip of the coin where you get that ""oh shit"" moment, and realized you really need to know what you want, and articulate exactly what you want from it. Because although you may have the idea fleshed out in your mind, you don't say it all when expressing it to another person.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was talking to my cousin the other day, who is having issues getting over that two-timing piece of shit that she was in a relationship with. (I am loyal to my cousin and to those who treat her right, and when I saw this guy again after all the drama, he tried to buy me drinks in an attempt to get him on my good side. I turned into a very rude drunk just for him.) She kept saying that no matter where she goes, tx or pa, things are there that remind her of him, and she thought it was her karma or fate to be with him. I told her that may be so, but there is such a thing as ill-fated events, and by definition alone those never end well. Think Romeo and Juliet. Very romantic. Not very practical.<br /><br />Sometimes&nbsp;I see that institution that way. Where you have one thing in mind for it, but you never really say what you want from it, and you think how fortunate you are to be here. And then little things really start to get on you, such as how many of the people here look and act the same. Or how the same thing occurs every weekend, without much variation, and it may not even be an activity you particularly enjoy, but there are few other options. But we keep reminding ourselves (or at least&nbsp;I do), about all the good things&nbsp;that have occurred here, the random people you meet, the events&nbsp;or locations you kinda stumble upon without really realizing that they were there. And of course, this usually happens senior year, so you are stuck with that wonderful feeling of slight regret and ""why didn't i know about this/you before!"". Bad timing I tells ya. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>um, so no one wonders, the answer is me. i pretty much have little right to complain about my life. kinda like how the guy on ""waiting"" went off, yeah, like that. so i went to a great university, studied abroad, met lots of cool people (even if few of them were genuine and all that jazz), and because i am a general slacker i dont know what i am doing with my life. yipee.&nbsp;<br />but, talking to someone on the phone today, i realized i really dont have right to complain. she was saying how she didnt have a right because she had a roof over her head and had a waitressing job, but was complaining she didnt have a second one, and thus couldnt pay off some of her debts. she compared herself to another guy who is a recovering druggie, recently lost his job, and got kicked out of his house. and he ran out of his meds, so he is currently going through withdrawel symptoms like whoa (he is a recovering heroin addict). so the ladder of no right to complain, we decided, went (least right) me-her-him (most right). so basically, its all relative. a fact i have always known, but for some stupid reason forgot. i am blaming it on the memememe!! mentality that people have here, and allowing myself to fall into it. so i have no clue what i am doing with myself... so what?&nbsp;it could be worse, it could be hella a lot worse. </p>"

"event","ummmm...so i definately suck at online posting. i figured i would be good at it, me liking to procrastinate and all, but apparently not. i am too lazy to properly and productively procrastinate. i dont remember the last time i actually said anything of import, but here is a vague catch up. i passed last semester (yay!), so lets hope i pass this one. adrian is stayin in PIT and sunny is moving back up there. the rest of the PA clan moved back down to texas where they belong. craig turned 8 years old this past weekend! soon, all the boys will be in hs and i will be freaking out. and handing out lots of condoms because seriously, we dont not need any more children for a good long while. unless they are yulys baby's because her kid is gorgeous. 

hmm, que mas? friendships have broken, be reforged, gotten stronger, or cracked under the pressure. or have just remained stagnant. as is the way life tends to go. ironically, i am getting closer to the people from hs. some of them have changed a lot, without the crazy stuff and expectations of the good ole hometown people really have changed quite a bit. i love it. sunny was telling me how we somehow switched roles. she was the crazy one when we were younger, the one people used to worry about and i was quiet and meek. now i am the one everyone worries about and they are just waiting for her to settle down, because thats what everyone expects her to do. i think as much as she would make a fabulous wife and mother, she is cut out for additional roles. she will surprise people yet, i know. 

going through nostalgia again, which is very bittersweet. i dont know what i should do about keeping up friendships. on one hand i really want to because i know they are important to me. but on the other, i feel liek the ohter person is not putting in the work or effort and is it really worth it? yep yep, damn cost benefit analysis."

STILL getting lost in edens. this is my duke experience and i want to enjoy it some more. or maybe i just dont want to enter the real world, get a job, and be that much closer to my family persistenlty asking ""well mija, when are you going to get married and have kids?"" keep in mind its not necessarily in that order. so yeah, that is my update of a rant/whine. hopefully future posts will either be more frequent or more chirpy. as a random sidenote, i love my black raspberry body spray :)."

this also means of course that it has been nearly 7 months since i have spent more than 7 days total with my family as well as that i am once again missing out on birthdays. and i havent seen any of my sucias since....well, november/december. and i miss my sucias so much! but i cant wait to see everybody in the fall, where i can ignore the fact that i am a senior...and have on f-ing clue what i am doing with myself. sometimes i just suck at life, but ya know what? i am in costa rica, so i will just chill...kinda, and remind myself. pura vida. :)"

"event","This one just has to be posted for sheer posterity. Sometimes I feel sorry for the Aussie students that sit around us at dinner time. Then I feel sorry for us because we  are having this conversation. Then I just tell myself ""what the hell"" this is probably the most interesting, but gross/insane/illogical conversation going on in the dining hall. Case in point, was yesterday's dinner. Following on the heels of the conversation about dead bodies from the day before, this one was about pubic hair. Female pubic hair in particular. As we ate our chicken and ice cream. 

Granted we did come up with a few interesting points. Such as why do so few mothers actually TELL their daughters about maintainence down there? i know my mother never brought it up. she would have had a seizure in the attempt. I got the whole nine yards of the sex talk when i was about 5, but everything else was left  unknown. The first time I got my period, I thought I had an internal wound and was bleeding to death. Granted I was about 10 years old, but the point remains that some things just never get discussed. But eventually most of us do figure out about that. But some people never get that the ""full bush"" jokes are there for a reason. Anywho, we discussed several of these random points at the dinner table. The aussie ""blokes"" sitting next to us often had looks of absolute horror on their faces. one was intently listening to our conversation, trying to appear as if he wasnt. i guess that would show them. it takes quite a bit for us to cross the dinner-appropriate conversation line. and few topics are barred. which always makes for interesting, albeit sometimes disturbing, but nonetheless animated dinner conversations."

"event","ok, so i am not going to whine and whinge away this livejournal. so y all can breathe a sigh of relief. what i am going to comment on however, is the fact that this weekend i damn well better be productive. all the dickinson folk are going to their farm stay, and katy and niki will fly to cairns. so that leaves christina and i to amuse ourselves. which by all means, normally gets us into worse trouble than if we had others to mediate. i find this vastly interesting, how christina and i manage to egg each other on and get into...interesting situations. and should i ever forget this i just need to remember two places: Friday's and Cairns. 
What I am also excited about is that I changed my plane ticket, so I get to go home 1 day earlier, which most importantly means that I wont miss my youngest brother's birthday party. My little Nic is turning 3! What is best, besides the fact that there will be massive amounts of GOOD food and real BBQ, is that half of my family will turn up for this. So i dont have to spend the short week that I am at home running all over freakin Texas paying those family visits. I can get them all done with one shot whilst stuffing my mouth with some good food. Life is (or rather, will be) goooood.
And speaking of food, we had our Butler farewell dinner the other day. We got there on time, which also meant that everyone else would be late. We had to wait about an hour before everyone got there and we could actually start to eat. The food was awesome, but the set up was strange. The food was prepared by ""Stonegrill"". What this means, is that it took about an hour (between appetizers and main course) for them to bring out, check this, raw meat. Yep. It was a hunk of seasoned raw chicken or seasoned raw steak on this really really really hot stone. And you cooked your own meat on this stone. I felt like a primitive woman in this fancy restuarant. It was interesting and a lot of fun though. And I must say, the chicken I cooked was awesome. The clincher is the dessert. It is maybe 40 degrees outside, and we are all shivering with the cold, heating our hands above our hot stones. But what do they serve for dessert? Ice cream. It made me laugh, even as my teeth chattered as I tried to eat it. Oh yeah, I managed.
Then getting back to Uni. Christina and I were freezing our asses off (she was wearing a dress poor thing, and I am just always cold). So we hugged each other and rubbed each others back to get some warmth. I think a few people thought we were lesbians. The fact that my head came right up to her breast didnt help. And the comments of Niki and Katy didnt either. But on the bus ride home, we were having some random conversation that I dont even remember, but we were laughing hysterically and getting more than our fair share of strange looks and maybe some annoyed glares (I chose to ignore those)."

Dr. Gill gave the college a lecture as he went on a tirade about the actions at the college Ball. apparently, someone had to be taken to the hospital, someone was arrested, others threw up, others urinated in the hallways, i know for a fact at least one guy passed out in the hallways...etc etc. well, frankly dr. gill, if you are going to bitch about this, remember that you are providing free alcohol to first year students and to students in general aged 17-20. they will not act well. and if you have problems with this, dont use college money to drive the students to these places or to the pub crawl for 'recovery' the next morning. commom sense. so quit your bitching. 

i have spent a lot of time recently watching movies or Big Brother. it saddens me to know that i wont be able to finish watching teh season. that makes me a sad (as in pitiful) puppy, yes i am aware. and it is fucking cold in Brisbane! no one told us it would get cold! wtf! i dont approve, not at all. 

and i learned not only is there a 24 hr McD in the city, but there is also a 24 hr Hungry Jacks. which made me happy. but i still hate this damn paper! aaaah! i need the lightbulb moment, but it still hasnt come. damn it."

#2. world goldfish racing. this was really sad, but also hilarious, and i dont know how i forgot. third day in cairns, we go to the woolshed for our free hostel dinner. the contest of the night is world goldfish racing. the night before it was dirty dancing, which we didnt stick around to see. but back to the goldfish. they would auction off the golfish, and people seriously payed up to $19 for these fish, in order for the chance to win a $100 bar tab. not beer this time, but bar. the names of the fish were hilarious. it was ""paddy"" from ireland, ""nemo"" from australia, ""monica"" from the US, ""sir charles"" from the UK, ""black balls the one-eyed pirate"" from new zealand, msytery fish from parts unknown (he was a beta fish i think), and ""sushi"" from japan... i think. i may be making up the japanese fish, not to sure. its been too long. anyway, you had a straw and blew bubbles behind the fish in order to get them to swim to the finish line. it was fucking hilarious. more than half of the second floor was crowded around the racing lanes in order to cheer on their fish. christina had a conversation with someone over the stamina of the fish from NZ. it was the most random hilarious thing ever. we cheered on monica, even though she got confused and swam back to the start line. paddy won, and someone started to yell that the goldfish needed to be checked for drugs. the things we do to amuse ourselves. :)"

"event","As part of our Butler package, Jason got most of us Americans tickets to go see a rugby match. apparently it was a big one, with the fun rivalry. Australia vs New Zealand. the Kangaroos vs the Kiwis. etc etc. i have no clue to how rugby is conducted. katy and i once tried to figure out some rules during the commonwealth games. lets just say we decided there were no rules when we saw one of the players tackle someone holding the ball and then proceed to BITE his ankle. literally. we discovered later that there are lots of rules to rugby union. i only learned 2 so as to understand the game. you can only throw the ball backwards, and the team can get tackled about 5 or 6 times before they have to kick the ball to the otherside. 

we leave the horrible bbq emmanuel provided us (i stuck to grilled fish, becuase quite frankly, i wasnt up to being disappointed by the disgusting sausages), and catch our free transport to the SunCorp stadium. The place is getting kinda full, and we eventually find our gate. what is great about hte place was that there were lines expressly for beer. they even had signs, instead of Burgers or Pizza or Snacks, that said ""QUICK BEER"". which was freakin awesome. to me at least. our seats were on the 6th floor of the stadium, and all those stairs provided a great reason for not getting up during the game. apparently this reason was lost on all the drunk guys sitting in front of us, since they spent half the game going for beer runs. also, there was the most annoying guy sitting in front of us. unfortunately, he was american and giving us all a bad name. he had no clue what was going on, but was loadly cheering and yelling at the refs etc. this would have been somewhat tolerable, except that he was cheering for the wrong f-ing team half the time! and he had no clue, absolutely none, about what the hell was going on but that didnt shut him  up. even me, christina, niki, and katy (who knew more than 2 rules) could figure out the game and when it was appropriate to cheer. but not this guy. and he waved his hands wildy about, and blocked my view a goodly portion of the time. que fucking annoying. overall though, we decided that rugby was easy enough to figure out. it is essentially a mix of 2 games. American Football. and Red Rover (remember that game from when we were kids, ""red rover red rover lets so-and-so come over""). yeah, thats rugby, but lacking the in the protective gear, and lots of legs flailing about. and itty bitty man-shorts. australia kicked fucking ass by the way, despite the fact that half of the new zealand team looked like giants who would eat you. just crush you in their meaty fists and ...well you get the point they were huge. and before the game started they did this funny Maori warrier looking dance that was great and slighlty intimidating but mostly amusing. and the cheerleaders were absolute crap. we decided that they were high-school level cheerleaders. in some parts of the country they wouldnt make JV. they kept trying to dance, but they were off rhythm, and they had no ass, and it just looked wrong. and me, who dances horribly, noticing this, yeah it was that sad. oh! and i had my first australian meat pie at the rugby game! my aussie experience is now complete. anywho, the game ended australia 50, new zealand 12. we kicked some kiwi ass.

we make it back home, and i get woken up from my sleep in the most hilarious fashion. due to extreme curiosity, i stay up in Christina's room for a while, where i get a facebook message from gaby saying she is on msn. so i log on, and get to chat with her for like 2 minutes. and then christina kicks me out because its past midnight among other reasons. my curiosity is now fulfilled by the way, so i rush over to the computer cluster where i yell at the computer for not letting me get onto aim. it eventually does, and i get to chat with my roomie for the first time in...hmmm, a LONG ASS TIME. which was great, even if it was only for a few minutes."

"event","we leave cairns. so sad. not really. we check out of our hostel and have, hm, about 5 hours to kill in a town where there isnt much to do. we grab breakfast in this greasy...place. its labor day, so nothing is really open. we go to the public pool and chill for teh next few hours. well, i study, they nap. we head on out to the airport early since there really wasnt much to do. 

the airport. oh my god. can we say complete and utter lack of security? not once did they check our ID or ticket. not to check in, through security, and they only scanned our ticket to enter the plane. what the hell. the checked my umbrella but not my ID. we were through the check in line and security in less than 5 minutes. 

i get told to stop studying about a million times by christina. i get distracted even more by the most adorable child in the airport. she was so cute, crawling around in her pink outfit! and she nearly robbed christina which was great. the plane once again is full of crying baby's despite our praying that they wouldnt be. i spend more of my time doing the puzzles in teh back of magazines than studyin. i suck sometimes. but back at UQ ... i didnt sleep that night. and the exam, at 8 am, fuckin kicked my sorry ass. and the paper was absolute crap, i was so frustrated with it i turned it in, complete, but not good at least 4 hours early. and my PBL wanted to make me pass out. not good. although i did get asked a random question about tongue piercings. oh well. 

i am done with my updates. i am tanner, and in a better mood now. crunch time is coming up. i have 3 papers and an exam all due on the same day. june 2 i will be contemplating suicide, i already know it."

"event","on the third day i had my own little trip. katy and christina were going sky diving in the afternoon and the bums didnt have to wake up. i unfortunately did. so i packed my bag, and my notes, and waited for the tour bus. my guide's name was Sydney, like the city. he reminded me of the actor from the count of monte christo, you know the one that got saved. shit, he's on other movies, like waiting. what is his name? but anyway, my tour guide looked like him. 

it was a small tour, only 6 of us. me, 2 scottish girl, a german guy, and 2 swiss girls. we went to a habitat sanctuary where we saw aussie birds, kangaroos, and koalas. i have seen enough kangaroos to last a lifetime. although the paddymelons there were so cute! and tiny! and they came up to you asking for food with no fear.none whatsoever. even teh mums with joeys came up asking for food. we went through port douglas, which is apparently very ritzy and it costs more to golf there than i would make in a year, assuming i had a decent job.

we went through the daintree national rainforest and mossman gorge. since we were such a small group, he took us on the longer trail and gave us a lot more information. daintree is believed to be one of the oldest rainforests in the world, so that was cool. and also info such as on aboriginal burying rites. it used to be that they buried people in trees. and they never spoke that persons name again, ever. that has changed to now, no speaking of the name or showing of pictures for 7 years. oh, and the most dangerous plant in the raiforest. its big with a heart shape with fine hairs along the top of it. it looks ok, but those little hairs are silica. and when you touch it, they get onto your skin. every time your skin contracts (think getting into the water, or shivering), then a batch of those silica hairs get into your skin and cause an intense burning sensation, described as having boiling hot water poured over the same batch of skin for three hours. this stuff stays on you for 2 years or more. they suggested we take it off with duct tape if we get it on us, or get ourselves waxed. but way back when, before they knew of this plant, the people who first came here often used this stuff for toilet paper. ouch. i bet they learned their lesson quick.

we also went for a crocodile spotting boatride down the daintree river. we did spot some crocodiles, both big and small. one they called Gummy because he is believed to be the oldest in the area, and is just extremely aggressive and has fought so much he has lost quite a few teeth. we saw pythons curled in tree branches, and some tree where if the sap hits you in the eye, it causes permanent blindness. and a ""train"" boat. our guide told us that its a bad day when ""you fall out of the boat, get chased by a crocodile, climb up a tree to escape only to break a branch and get sap in your eye, get bitten by a python, fall out of the tree, and get run over by the train. welcome to north queensland folks"" 

after daintree, we made our way up to cape tribulation. where it is doubly world heritage listed, because its where the daintree national rainforest meets the great barrier reef. apparently the reef is only a few hundred meters from shore as opposed to kilometers. we head back home after this, its a 2.5 hour drive. i have been studying for my stupid molecular cell bio exam every time we get back in the bus. i hate this exam by this time, it is ruining my vacation and bday weekend. 

i find my way to the woolshed for dinner and meet up with katy and christina. they survived skydiving. we share our tales of the day, finish (or rather, christina finishes) a jug of beer. we leave early since we have to check out the next morning. they tell me that some maintenance worker of the hostel keeps coming into the room and its creeping them out. they think he's our roomie, but they arent too sure. they are pretty positive that he is though, or else that would just be weird since he doesnt knock or anything. we get back and there is the maintenance worker aka our roomie in his bed, lights off. he's awake and we flip on the switch and get ready for bed. none of us really win the bet. his name is cameron he is 24, from england, and fairly tall. and he must have been missing girlie conversations with his sister and friends like whoa. we had a slumber party type conversation for at least an hour. just all of us randomly talking sharing pick up lines we have heard (he had a good one involving a watch, and not wearing any knickers). he was a super sweet guy, so its sad we only spoke to him that one time. but i guess thats just the way hostels are. i hope his next roomies dont suck as, cuz we were awesome :)"

"event","day 2 in cairns begins frighteningly early. given the fact that (drunk) me and christina returned to the hostel at about 3 am did not help since we woke up at 7 am. and the poor guy who is sleeping below me. i did try to get a few good looks at him...but me being not in complete control of my mind decided to look at him in the dark. not intelligent i know. but we must have woken up the poor guy the next day as we left for the day. exact age and ethnicity of the 4th roomate is still unknown, but we know its a guy! katy's idea of it being a butch female lost.

we get our vouchers to go snorkelling at the pier and the reception lady tells us to go to Pier B. We go and get one the boat. and its packed. as in little to no seating room. our names werent on the list, but apparently this happens all the time, so they just had us sign a waiver and wrote us in. we get our gear, which takes a while since we all have tiny feet and they cant find flippers that fit us right. our gear is kinda gross, but w/e. we muscle our ways to some seats and wait on the getting more crowded boat. then all of a sudden someone says ""katy, rickie, and christina? come with me."" unh huh. that sounded a lot like what we were told in elementary school when you did something bad and had to go to the principals office. but it all works out for the best. apparently we were on the wrong boat. so we had to collect our backpacks and ship on out. katy insisted that she knew it was the wrong boat, because ours wasnt supposed to be so crowded. and we eventually find the right boat, and she was right. only 20 people were on this boat...as opposed to like 70 on the other one. and we get free muffins and soup on our new ritzy boat. we ride out to the reef which is an hour and a half VERY bumpy ride. oh, and i discovered something. i get sea-sick. that was a fun thing to discover. we get to the reef, and gear up, and jump in the water. and i swimming about looking down at the reef which is probably like 5 meters down, and thinking ""oooh pretty"". then i continue to swim and the reef gets closer and closer and closer and closer. at various times i was literally about a foot above the reef. it was AMAZING! except when you come up to adjust the mask or make sure you didnt swim too far from the boat, and then all of a sudden *WHAM* your leg smacks into a coral reef. i now have many new and interesting bruises. but omg, was it amazing. i cant even describe it. colorful with lots of different fish. i found Nemo! and Dori! and Gill! and also a turtle and shark. but it was one of the smaller nicer, non-maneater sharks so we were good. and i am still feeling woozy. so every time i felt like i was going to puke, i swam back to the boat, grabbed one of the biodegradable bags (it was my friend on this trip), waited till i felt better and jumped back into the water. it was an awesome day, seasickness and all. 

we went to the woolshed for dinner. we left early because we just couldnt do it all over again. we got to the room, and roomie #4 was missing. so yet another day of his identity unknown."

"event","Day 1 at Cairns. Imagine me being a good student. i study for my molecular cell bio exam in the airport and on the plane, and to the hostel. our hostel, by the way, was...interesting. it wasnt state of the art (what hostel is?) but i think there were as many bugs inside as there was outside. poor christina ended up looking like she got attacked by ants or some other biting creature (which she was). we are all together in the same room, with a fourth bed (the one below mine) occupied, but the person wasnt there. We decide to take a walk around Cairns, and whoa, definately not what any of us expected. first of all, we couldnt find our way around, there were no sidewalks, and it essentially wasnt the city that we imagined it to be. in fact, it wasnt a city at all. it was a bit run down, and then you cross the train station and BAM it was ritzy. as in botiques and all that mess. We try to find the beach, because its Cairns and all the postcards say the beaches are beautiful. We found instead a swimming pool by a giant mass of mud. we were confused. to say the least. the beachs were left unfound and we went back to the hostel so i could get my ID. 

in the hostel, we are once again intrigued by the fourth missing person. we decide to amuse ourselves till dinner time by guessing who it is. the backpack has cuba written on them, so christina guesses its a cute cuban male. katy goes for the humourous and guesses that its a  big butch female. i decide that its probably some short (just for amusement since the backpacks were huge) white guy, probably european. and by this i meant english/german/swiss etc. you know, the more blonde of the europeans. 

We have our free hostel dinner at the Woolshed. now apparently, the woolshed is infamous. its an irish pub with lots of wood and stank like beer. we hear guys in line talking about balloons and getting it popped doggie style and some other stuff that i would prefer not to go into.  so that apparently is why it is infamous. but we gals all just roll our eyes at each other over this conversation. christina ordered a jug and finished the thing off by herself (it took a while but she did). katy buys me a smirnoff, and i buy myself a cheap cup of white wine. the place starts to fill up. and the lights start to dim. and happy hour begins. then all of a sudden, this random guy with a microphone is yelling about Battle of the Sexes. and about a $50 bar tab to be won. Christina gets excited and keeps yelling that i need to enter the contest because its my bday. i tell her i'll do it if she does. i figured she would back down. she didnt. so, we went up there as the female team for the Battle of the Sexes. i am not going to go into what the battle of the sexes entailed. lets just say, that upon hearing a task or two, i quickly drank the rest of my wine. the point of the matter is, christina and i won! whooohooo. ok, that was really sarcastic. but the $50 bar tab was apparently a $50 beer tab, so now we had seriously about 8 jugs of free beer. and only christina drank beer. i was a trooper though, and drank some of it. i still hate beer.

katy at this point (its about 12 am) gets the right idea and leaves. keep in mind we have to wake up at 7 am to go snorkelling on the great barrier reef. what christina and i were thinking in staying i dont know. by this time the woolshed was pretty packed and the tables were no longer just used for your drinks, girls were dancing and stripping on them as well. thats what alcohol will reduce  you to. i am pretty drunk at this point, and me and christina are dancing. then all of a sudden she grabs my hand and drags me to some table. and talks to this guy. i was so confused, i didnt know what was going on. she kept turning around and asking me ""is he cute?"" and i couldnt tell, so i just kinda described him to her. the description didnt stick because she asked me about 5 times the same question. drunk christina is funny. i am getting bored because i am at the corner of this table and dont know anyone there. 

one of the girls takes pity on me and invites me to sit with her and some guy. i walk across the table (literally) and plop down next to the guy. they recognize me as one of the contestants and say how they cheered us on. yay. lol. ok, so i start talking to the guy, who is from ireland. he had a strong accent that my drunk brain couldnt comprehend for a bit of the time. his girlfriend's name was niamgh or something like that. its spelled ugly but sounds pretty. well, niamgh gets up to dance adn me and the guy continue to talk about random stuff. then niamgh comes back, and sits at the table in front of us. the guy, alan, tries to ask her a question about gaelic, but she gives him the dirtiest look, rolls her eyes, and turns back around, only to stalk off a second or two later. me and the guy are both really confused. i ask him what is wrong, and apparently, she has forgotten, in her drunk mind, that she invited me to sit with him and her in the first place, so now she is pissed off that he is talking to me. uh-oh. but apparently she does this quite frequently and alan tells me not to worry about it. eventually we decide it would be best if he chases his girl and makes nice. 

christina has disappeared, so i go in search for her. only to be sidetracked by this really tall english guy (whats with me and english guys in backpacker pubs? i dont know?). i eventually tell him that i need to find my friend and go in search, once again, for christina. i give up and texxt her that it is time to go. the english guy finds me again, and asks ""am i asking for help?"". i show him the message to assuage his self-esteem and try to look around for christina again. but now, some other drunk english guy approaches me and says ""why did you dump my friend?"" i dont know how to respond to this, so i just said that i didnt dump anyone. he insists that i did, and said that i dumped his friend, who really loves me. he knows this because his friend told him so. ooooookay. i end up getting sidetracked by the englishguy again. then all of a sudden i see christina, with some new guy. i run over to her and tell her we have to leave, its time to go, we have to wake up to damn early. she insists on 30 more minutes. i decide what the hell, and wonder towards the dance floor where i saw this cute guy who looked like the guy from prison break. drunk thinking isnt too straight, i know. instead i get sidetracked by the enlishguy again. but then i am approached by ANOTHER drunk english guy. this one was apparently the one christina was with earlier in the night. and he tells me not to do to his friend what my friend did to him. to give love a chance. what. the. fuck. i nearly run in the other direction. 

eventually christina is ready to go. and we dont think of a cab. instead we walk back to the hostel. and we find our way back! katy later joked that i could find my way drunk, in a city i had been in for less than 6 hours, with confusing roads back to the hostel, but i couldnt get to the opera house sober in sydney. yeah, i know. so making all sorts of noise christina and i return to the hostel. all my stuff is still on the bed, so i make a crap load of noise tyring to get it off so i can go to bed. its ok, christina made more noise. in her drunken mind the methods she used were to decrease the noise level. but leaving the door open and dragging her suitcase into the hallway didnt do that. i love drunk christina. so, at a bit past 3 am, a very tired me finally crashes."

"event","back in Brisbane, and everyone is on break still. I got to meet some random people I never would have otherwise those. Like Minlee (dont know how to spell that). She is afraid of fruit stickers. literally. she runs away when she sees them. and she has no idea of what is appropriate to say to people, so she seems really offensive, but is really just oblivious. And then there is Ching, from Singapore, who is 32 and a med student. and who has work ethic like whoa, and was part of the Navy and stationed in Hawaii. And Akshee, the Indian girl from downstairs who isnt Australian but is from Kenya. wtf. who the hell is from KENYA? Ash apparently is. And she speaks 4 languages. i feel dull and unaccomplished compared to these people.

But since Ash lives in my wing, I invite her out to go Salsa dancing on wed. since no one is here UQ dance decided just to hook someone's ipod up to the speakers and let everyone just dance. We go and the group is maybe 20 people. luckily its an even split for guys and girls, so we are good to go. its a whole bunch of beginners, so we try making up some moves. which leads to us females nearly getting strangled, but is heaps of fun. Then Jose (who is from mexico, but his parents are from el salvador and he has lived in australia for 20 years) decides he is going to teach us the rudiments of rueda. cuz what the hell, why not? put a whole bunch of australians (and asians) in a group and teach them some rueda moves is hilarious. because jose will show the move, and all the guys have a stupified expression on their face of ""how'd he do that?"" and the girls have a worried expression of ""oh shit, i am going to get hurt by this guy trying to this"". but we managed, and no one got hurt. 

we decide to go out to the RE afterwards. luckily Ian, some random australian guy, has a car and drives us there. so no paying for public transport. except he get absolutely smashed and cant drive back. so we walk 3 km at 1 AM trying to get back to emmanuel where Ian is going to crash on someones floor. Its a group of 5 at this point, which is fine, and 4 of us are returning to Emmanuel. we get back, and decide we want to have a sleepover in the Junior Commons Room. so we take our blankets and sleep on the huge couches. except the boys (ian and lee) decide they want to play pool. we learn a few things. like Lee is from papau new guinea (i have no clue how to spell that) but his mum is from south africa. and Ian's dad is apparently loaded, and ian is rich as hell. we eventually get to sleep, and at 4 AM people start coming into the JCR. its about 10 guys, who woke up at 4 AM to watch soccer on the tele. WHAT THE HELL! are they crazy? and then the security guard wakes us up and tells us its best to return to our beds because the cleaning lady will be vacuuming. so we go back to our respective beds. ian ends up jumping through an open window in order to get into Lee's younger brothers room (who isnt here) and sleep on his bed. which was an amusing sight to see. 

and now, i really dont have to right all this. except i have 2 papers and an exam to prepare for, which i really dont want to do. so i have LJ as a check on my list of procrastination. booo work, boo studying. oh well, 2 more months. just two more months and this semester will be over...kinda."

"event","so if you havent read the previous entry, that would be a good idea, scroll down to the part where i have the dumb idea of going to a bar in sydney, and that will get you up to speed. 

so i am at sidebar, with the free goon and the quickly getting drunk british people. i pour myself a cup of the free white wine, and keep it in front of me to ward off the many ""why arent you drinking!"" exclamations. the cup is a small plastic dixie-like cup, so i wasnt worried about getting drunk. except that when i taste it, it literally tastes like lemonade to me. i had to ask laura if we were sure this was wine, because it didnt taste alcoholic. she was like ""oh, yeah, its wine. wait for two or three of those little cups and you will be dancing like an idiot on top of a table. they hit you hard."" hmmm, so yet another reason not to drink it quickly.

the pool tournament starts, and i bow out. i really dont feel like losing $2 on something i know i am not going to win. its laura's bday so she gets to play for free. and since she doesnt know how to play, paul/mark sets up shots for her. and he gets his own shots in the process. so we are rooting for paul/mark to win the tab because he already declared should he win, he is buying us all drinks. which he is pretty much doing anyway. because happy hour has arrived, and jugs of cocktails are $10. now this was amusing as hell. imagine a beer jug filled with a bright blue, red, ginger, yellow, green, or white liquid. people were either drinking it staight out of the jug, or they had straws in it. so, if you were like we were, you had four (more or less) straws in a jug and shared. yves starting going through the colors of the cocktails and i dont know how he managed to keep that much liquid inside of him. paul/mark bought 4 jugs during the pool tournament. chris bought three. add this to several cups of free wine. they were a happy crowd. 

i am still working on the same dixie cup of wine. everyone assumes i have been refilling my cup with the wine, so so far i havent been pressured too much to drink more. paul/mark keeps giving me glasses of the jug drink, because he thinks i need to vary my alcoholic diet or something. i dont know. i just pass them to adam or chris, and they are tipsy enough and smart enough not to question teh appearance of more free alcohol. guys, they never have to work about spiking. i do try half a glass of the ginger colored cocktail, and it is very sweet, and doesnt taste alcoholic in the slightest. but when i have to get up to go to the toilet, i realize, that yeah, 1.5 cups of alchohol do have an effect. i get dizzy standing up, and have to pause before taking a step. i nearly stumble my way to the bathroom. now i learned this lesson my sophmore year, but apparently it didnt stick very well. dont drink on an empty stomach. especially not a stomach that hasnt been fed properly in three days. when i get back to the table, i get half a glass of mystery white cocktail, and just hold on to it for another hour or two. 

the entire table is now passed buzzed and in the getting very drunk stage of the night. everything is hilarious to us. we argue about the music the DJ is playing. chris hates sean paul, which gets me fired up, because i like sean paul. you can dance to sean paul, therefore i like him. he preferred more soft rock or dance/house type music. so did adam. i was disgusted with their music preference and told them so. this led to arguments about movies (me and adam both love empire records, so i couldnt hate him for that one and chris likes some hip-hop so i forgave him for the sean paul thing). 

since the free goon was done with, they handed out 2 for 1 vouchers, and all the guys got up again to get more drinks. adam comes back first, and comments that he thinks paul/mark is trying to hard to get with laura. this surprises me because i thought the two were together. she has his wallet in her purse, they are touchy-feely etc. at some point, i start talking to paul/mark and learn that they are travelling together. they have been to a crap load of countries, and will be in teh US by (our) summer time amking their way from LA to NYC. laura prefers women, but they share a double room so that each can bring someone back if they want to. so what do you know, adam was right.

paul/mark is pretty damn drunk. he loses the pool tournament because he cant stand up straight anymore.  him, chris, and adam keep offering to buy me drinks. they see i dont have a beer or a cocktail anymore and this upsets all three for some reason. so half my night is spent turning down drinks. i turn down about 20 offers for free drinks. go me and self control. had i accepted those offers....well, i probably not have made it back home or to the train. 

for one reason or another we decide to leave sidebar. adam, chris, and yves were really confused because they thought we were going to teh dancefloor, so when we got outside, they finally realized that we werent on the dancefloor. everyone sees me standing up, and realize just how short i am. i didnt realize how tall they were. chris and yves were about 6'5, adam 6'2, and paul/mark 5'8. i informed them i was fun sized, and tehy were too goddamn tall. we go to another bar called scubar around the corner. the place is packed. we enter as they are playing michael jackson. paul/mark buys more drinks. and by this point he is so pissfaced. 

he starts to think that it is a good idea to strip down. it starts gradually where he is just unbuttoning his shirt and rubbing his nipples, progressing to taking off his shirt, and ending in the grand finale of the night where his shirt was being whirled above his head and not only were his pants down, but his boxers were around his ankles as well. i wasnt expecting this and i turned to yell at him to pull up his pants, looked down, saw...him...and red-faced turned right back around and laughed so hard i nearly collapsed on the floor. i dont know who convinced him to pull back on his pants. but paul/mark was hilarious. he kept hitting on random girls in teh bar, but he was so obviously drunk that most ignored him. whenever he danced with one, he would make funny faces above her head at us. when a girl turned him down, he would tell me ""whatever. she is going to go to teh curb and complain how there are no guys."" i danced with him a few songs, and i am sure he made faces above my head as well, but he told me each and every time we danced ""why are you staying in a dorm room! bad idea! so bad, you cant bring anyone home with you. why the hell did you choose a dorm room?!""

chris buys me a smirnoff because ""it has been too bloody long since i held a drink."" paul/mark starts dancing with someone that chris thinks is one of the ugliest girls in the bar, and is confounded that paul/mark would dance with her, she is so butt-ugly in his eyes. then the girl comes up behind chris and grinds up against him. the poor guy looked horrified. so i join him, and dance in front of him. the group gets the idea and join us in a line. when we finally separate, chris profusely thanks me and says how he has never done that before. so for the rest of the night, the guys kept trying to recreate it with me. 

adam and i finally walk back home in the wee hours of the morning. wee get back to the hostel past 4 am. we talk in teh dining area, and he goes off on how he going to cook me lunch tomorrow and how we are going to have another great night tomorrow. i burst his bubble and tell him i am leaving tomorrow. so he decides that we are going to watch empire records as a going away movie, which he has packed with him. so by 7 am, i am still up, havent slept, and needing to check out. it was a hilarious night. i dont know how much everyone else remembers of it, but it was so funny and so much fun. damn, i wish i knew that i would have that much fun and syndey. 

i learned a lesson though. backpacker bars are the place to go if you actually want to hold a conversation with someone."

"event","ok, this is the day entry for day 2 of sydney. i wake up at the asscrack of dawn, shower, eat my allotment of apple and peanut butter, and study. yes i study, because i am a dork, and have a test when i come back. so i am sitting in a backpackers hostel at 7 am, studying microtubules and intermediate filaments in the dining area. i head back to room where i discover two people are up, because they have to check out before losing their key deposits. so i chat with these two people, dont learn their names, and head outside to wait for my tour bus thing. 

i am going on a tour of the blue mountains, and was told to meet the driver outside. at the meeting time, he still isnt there. i start to worry, because perhaps they lost my reservation like Nomads did, and i paid $80 and not going. i dont have any phone minutes, so i cant call to verify or anything. eventually i see the oztrails bus down the block and happily go over. its a small tour, only 20 people. our driver is this really funny guy named Jed who is like this older hippie/punk guy. He was from brisbane originally, but decided the police ruled state of 20 yrs ago just wasnt condusive to his creative health, and he moved to sydney. he is a huge smart ass, typical aussie humor, and just sarcastically makes fun of everything the whole time. i learn Harbour Bridge has the affectionate name of Madonna's Bra from him. 

We go to Scenic World and ride the ""steepest railway in the world!"" which is pretty damn steep. at one point you are nearly standing straight up. thank god it was a short ride, or i would seriously be freaking out. we go to all sorts of places, like to see the 3 sisters, the canyons, King's Tabletop, Prince Henry's (or charles or something) lookout, some kangaroos, and some other random stuff. the blue mountains look like a not so deep grand canyon covered in trees and surrounded by blue mist. so they really are blue. something about all the eucalyptus trees, the oil they secrete, and light refraction that gives them this blue look from afar. we stop for lunch at this posh restuarant and i have a semi-real meal. i didnt know i would get served actual food, so i had drank lot of water, and when i saw i was getting real food i was already full. i was like...shit, thats not cool. so i eat but i feel like i am going to get sick, so i stop eating. this should be a sign for me to start eating more food in sydney, but i am slow and on a REALLY tight budget. 

our tour is cut short by about 3 hours because all the paths to the waterfalls we were to see were closed to due to maintainence. so we go by the olympic stadium, learn some random facts, and get on a ferry to get back to the Harbour. We arrive back in sydney during the daylight hours, so I decide to walk the 3 km back to my hostel instead of going on public transport. like i said, i was poor here, and i didnt have enough money for food, i definately didnt have enough money for transport. its getting dark quick though, so i hurry my happy ass up to find Pitt St. to find my way back. it takes a while, because I get lost again, and ended up going in teh wrong direction initially, and having to walk extra to get back to where i need to get. 

I get to the hostel dirty and tired and hungry and in serious want of a lot of things, like sleep, which i could get, and food, which i couldnt. so i eat another apple, and another little packet of PB (think of a pat of butter, about that amount of PB). i bring out my notes to study some more, yes i am a nerd. Emily, the American, is teasing me about what a good student I am, and i have to tell her no, i'm not, because i havent done half the shit i was supposed to do on the ride here etc etc. she tells me that we have three new people in our dorm room, all of whom are guys. she only met one, and he said he was kinda shy. she leaves to shower, i continue to study. one of the guys comes in and changes and messes with his stuff for a while, then leaves, leaving the door wide open. he comes back once or twice more, each time leaving the door open. emily comes back from her shower, and is like, wtf, why is the door open. i couldnt exactly figure it out myself so i just shrugged. 

me and emily talk for a while, i tell her about a gay friendly bar i went to in the valley with the drag queen shows, adn she gets excited because one of her friends just came out and they want to take her to a gay/lesbain friendly club. the open-door guy returns again and is messing with his stuff, and listening to our conversation. he grins like mad at some points, because i guess these 2 american girls with these descriptions are amusing. whatever. he sees my notes, and makes a comment about them. i tell him that its dark out, what else am i supposed to do at this hour? his obvious response is to go out and enjoy the sydney nightlife. guys. i have to inform him that as a female, alone, in strange big city, going out alone is not a great idea. its not even a slightly good idea, its a very bad one. he has this ""oh shit, right, forgot about the whole girl thing"" moment. add the whole, i dont have enough money to eat properly much less have enough money to buy alcohol or a cab back home bit, and going out is a horrible idea. then he tells me that he is going to a bar a few blocks down the road where they are serving free goon (read wine) and having a pool tournament for a $50 bar tab at the place, and that i should go. a mate of his told him about it, and that it should be pretty good time, at the very least, music and free goon. emily gets excited and insists i should go out, just so i wont study. i decide, what teh hell, its only three blocks away, and i dont like wine very much, much less cheap wine, so no worries. i go in the same gear i went hiking in, jeans, tennis shoes, white tank top, and a green sweater thing. i am dirty and prolly smelly, so i fit right in with the backpackers. 

i leave with this guy, knowing only that he is from the UK. I learn other facts, so its not as bad. His name is Adam, he has been in Australia for 8 months, his job is teaching little kids how to rock climb and absail and all that outdoorsy stuff. He is turning 21 in two weeks (so in early may), and he came to Australia with $100 in his pocket, but his finances are running low, so he is returning back to the UK after this Sydney trip to finish his last year for his college degree in the UK. He was staying at a ""posh"" hostel for few nights till a bed opened up at Nomads. we pass up his old hostel, and the place looks like a hotel, not a hostel. very posh indeed. Adam, who was supposed to be the shy guy, definately isnt. in fact he is quite chatty. and he smokes so i stay upwind of him so as not to smell like cigarettes too too much (a useless goal i soon learn). 

At 7 pm, we get to the bar and its really kinda empty. he is wondering if he got ""faulty information"" and asks the bartender chick about it. as we wait for her to learn the truth from the manager, we chat some more. he decides he wont wait for free goon, and buys a schooner of beer. we talk some more over random stuff, like Harry Potter, which he is reading in the hostel. (Everyone seems to have a book in teh hostel, and they are big thick books, which to me for some reason was amusing, but prolly smart considering all the planes/trains/buses everyone has to take). A huge group of people arrive, and its his mates. 2 people from nomads are with them, and we all head to the back of the bar for the goon and pool. i end up sitting on the bench diagonal from adam (i didnt want to be a social shadow or cling to him or anything, but i wanted to be somewhat around at least one person i kinda knew). i am sitting across from this guy who is wearing a pink looking sweater drinking this huge pint of beer. when lighting gets better later in teh night, the sweater is indeed pink. 5 people are on each side of the bench. i am sitting next to some skinny blonde chick and a guy who she is with who looks kinda like the older brother in teh TV show supernatural. and on the other side of them is two other random people. I learn that i am the only american of this bunch, and there is one guy from japan, and one from western australia. everyone else is from the UK. The pink sweater guy's name is Chris, and once he has a few beers, he gets very talkative, and quite amusing. The blonde girl is Laura, and she hated the wine, so she bought 2 drinks waiting for happy hour to begin at 8 pm. The guy she is with is named either Paul or Mark, i couldnt figure out which, the name changed throughout the night. A guy from Amsterdam, Yves, joins us at some point early in the night. And lets say, whoa, what a night. I am going to leave off here, because the night entry kinda needs its own thing, it will be too long, so everyone can stop reading now. :)"

"event","ok, i havent slept in nearly 3 days. i had a decent meal for the first time today in like, five days. i have consumed more calories from alcohol one night than i have in a two days. i have been lost so many times, its suprising that i didnt end up robbed or in the opposite end of where i needed to be, and that i made my way back to brisbane. lack of proper food (since friday) and any resemblance of sleep (since sunday) has made more than a bit delusional, and thus any entry i make now would make absolutely no sense. but i felt completely compelled to share the fact that sydney is amazing, backpackers are hilarious (wait till i write about paul/mark and laura) and i have sworn off (as much as i can) student bars and want to go to more backpacker places. my sydney entries will prolly come in parts, since i dont want to write super long entries, so it may be best to read them from oldest to newest. i guess i can start one now.

saturday i take a train from brisbane to casino to sydney. its a 14 hour long train ride (give or take an hour). i spend my last $4 of prepaid phone minutes callng my mom, to let her know that i am still alive, and will call her when i return to brisbane. as a side not, my brother Nic is starting to understand jokes now. My mom was singing to him, and in a song she changed ""and the kitten says meow"" to ""the kitten says moo"". nic stopped singing and looked at her, then laughs and says ""mama silly."" so when the next line of the song came up, she goes and ""the puppy says...what does he say nic?"" and he responds ""the puppy says baa baa"" and laughs. so he is understanding jokes, and starting to make them. as much as a 2 year old can. on a not so light side, i found out that my mom has glycoma. so she is going blind. i teased her a bit about it, because i know how much her sight means to her. i told her she is going to be a pot head, and as long as she doesnt become a crack whore, i will still love her as my drug addicted mother. but yeah, she is going blind and this is for woman for whom reading tops her favorite things list.  her doctor says that it is still relatively recent onset, and that she can get medication to halt its process, hopefully. the good news is that learning this scared her,and if she gets insurance the first thing she is going to do is go to a doctor to get herself checked out overall.

other than that, the bus and train ride were uneventful. it was so cold on the train and they never heard of complimentary blankets. so i didnt sleep the night through, and arrived in sydney disoriented and FREEZING. the temp was so friggin low, i was more than cranky. 

luckily, the train station is on pitt st, the same as my hostel was. so i kinda walk up and down the pitt street trying to figure out if the numbers are going up or down the block. i figure it out, and walk to nomads/maze (my hostel, it had two names, or rather it was the maze, and this particular one was nomads). it was in this...eclectic part of the city. it was by a latin food place, convenience store, chinatown, discount stores, and adult book stores. i find out you cant check in till 2, and its only 7 am. i store my stuff downstairs. turns out the storage area used to be a bathroom, and they converted the old shower stalls into luggage storage. kinda. my reservation was lost, and its easter weekend, so the lady behind the counter is trying to find a spare bed to put me in for 2 nights. i find one, and get upgraded. by upgraded i mean i was originally in a 8 bedroom dorm room, and i got put in a 6 bedroom dorm room. 

so with my camera and a map stored in my purse (i had forgotten the camera my first run into the city, and had to walk 5 blocks back to get it), i go into the city. i go to hyde park where in addition to seeing an anzac memorial statue and reflection pool, i also got to see a lot of homeless people and backpackers who didnt get accomodations sleeping in the park. i see an outdoor pic exhibit which was cool. i find my was to darling harbour. yes i did search for 42 wallaby way (from finding nemo), and no i didnt find it. yes, i am aware i am a dork. i went to the sydney aquarium and saw a shark feeding. i found out that some sharks lay eggs in these corkscrew like seashell looking things, which was cool. i petted a baby shark, and it felt grainy to touch. 

after that i walked along the wharf looking for the opera house and harbour bridge. i had the lofty goal of walking across the bridge. that didnt happen my feet hurt like hell. i found The Rocks, and some markets. the markets were freakin expensive though, so i didnt buy anything. i saw some street performers, like contortionists and magicians, and more than a few musicians. i decided against the opera house tour because i missed the last one. so instead i walked in the botanical gardens looking for Mrs. macquieries chair. and that broad's chair is freakin hard to find. it took me about two hours to get to the damn thing. basically, the rock in the bay was carved for seating area for the governors wife (Mrs. M) because she helped plan teh harbour area of the city or something. after this long search i make my way trying to et out of teh gardens. that takes quite a while as well. i do manage to find a colony of bats though hanging out in the trees during the daylight hours. there were alot and they were loud. very chatty bats. 

i try now to find my way back to my hostel. i get lost, obviously. i dont know where i am or how i got there. i finally say fuck it, i'll be a tourist, and pull out the damn map. and realize how way off course i got. so i try to make my way back to a recognizable street, and find a barricks museum on teh way, so i go in and see some of the stuff they have in there. i also find an old catholic cathedral, so i go in and light a candle, because hell, its easter, and lots of people are going through rough stuff back at home. on the upside, i found free food. (i had only had a banana and an apple all day, and its nearly 6 pm, and i must have walked about 8 miles). it was some easter festival type thing where i got a free cuppa tea, and a hotdog. yay food! yay free food! i get back to my hostel, and check in. i am in blue 32. 

turns out that the maze lives up to its namesake. its a fuckin maze. i get lost IN the hostel trying to find my room. and i feel better knowing that i wasnt the only one, as i learned the next night. i finally find my room, except my key doesnt work. a blonde british girl in teh room lets me in and lay down my stuff on an empty bed though. some other guy is in the room as well, though i never really talk to him, and he checks out the next morning. i shower, and never has a shower felt so good. yes, i got lost finding the shower as well. after that, i just remembered that the marilyn monroe door was the female bathroom on my part of the ""hall"". the hostel is showing movies and giving out free popcorn, and my feet hurt so i go to that. i get lost trying to find teh TV room. i go to the game room (3rd floor, pool table and more rooms up there) and some other places till i figure out that is was on my floor, by the kitchen (lots of people cooked their food at this hostel, i was impressed). i manage to last through 2/3 of king kong before i say fuck it, i just couldnt stay up any longer. 

i meet some people in my dorm. an american named emily from NY and another dark haired british girl who looks like an elf to me. we are all travelling alone, except they have been in sydney for a few days. we gossip, as girls tend to do, for about an hour or two, before deciding that we should probably sleep. i go to bed completely wiped out, but thank god this hostel provided thick blankets. so that was the end of day 1."

"event","It being Good Friday and all, with no classes, and most things closed, Katy, Niki, Kim (from Dickinson College, another american), and I decide to go to the Australian Zoo, home of the Crocodile Hunter Steve Erwin. Of course, EVERYBODY has told us that Steve Erwin in hardly ever there, and not to hold on breathe about seeing home. no biggie, they have fun cut outs of him you can take a picture with. and they have tigers :)

this great expedition makes me wake my tired ass up at 530 in the freakin mornin. we have to be up and have breakfast by 630 in order to get to a ferry to take us to the train that will take us to the bus that will FINALLy get us to the zoo. The trip just to get there, is about 2 hours each way. Everything goes wrong in the morning. we dont leave breakfast in time and miss the ferry by about a minute. so we call a taxi to take us to the transit center, but the taxi never comes, so we end up taking the next ferry. but no one who worked on teh ferry knew how much we needed to pay to actually get to the zoo through public transport. we figure it out finally (it was 13 zones, and considering that st lucia and brisbane cover only 2 zones, you can see that it is quite a bit aways). we walk to the transit center, which looked a lot closer than it actually was, and start looking for the platform our train is leaving from. it was platform 7 so we are kinda takin our time getting there, because for some strange reason we thought we had time. we look at the screen again, and our train is flashing. thats not good. so we break out into a sprint following all the stupid signs for platform 7 and run smack into a staircase. but of course. what else. we make the train by, like, the skin of our teeth. and we all promtly fall asleep for the train ride. at beerwah (that is the name of the town its in, isnt that great!), we find out that a courtesy bus will take us to the zoo (yay for free stuff). 

everyone at the zoo, and i mean the volunteers, are dressed up in easter gear. bunny ears and all that. there is a guy with ears, black pants, and a bow tie on (no shirt) giving out free muffins. it was great. we feed the elephants, which stink to high heaven but are so cute, and we try to wonder on down to Tiger Temple to see the tigers before they have a showcase later on. we end up going along this random path and seeing teh wombats (which are these huge cute....things. they are just rotund), the kangaroos, some rainforest birds, and emus. in the koala part we are able to pet a koala, which was chillin in a tree. i start talking to the guy who worked in the area. we ask about how to get to the crocoseum, where all teh shows will be held. and then we say that we have a heard a rumor that steve erwin has been at the zoo a few times in the past few days. he tell us that he hasnt personally seen steve there today. but if we go to the croc show today *winking* that would be a good thing. so we get super excited and hightail it to the crocoseum. except we get distracted by the african elephants heading back to their home. they are holding each others tails just like in dumbo, and one decides to say screw it, and it headed off the path into the trees and started munching. the trainer kept trying to coerce it back onto the path, but it wasnt having any of it. the other 2 elephants decided this one had the right idea, and tried to go into the bushes and eat from the trees as well. the poor trainer was getting frustrated, but finally got them all to grab each others tails and head back to their home.

we get to the crocoseum and miss the first half of the snake show. the place is packed, and we cant find really good seats. we finally find decent seats, and just continuously move forward until we have GREAT seats, right in front of the 'stage' about three rows in. and we sit in for the long haul. we find out that steve erwin's daughter Bindi Sue, who is only 8 years old, has a show on this week. she is singing and dancing about wildlife with these four guys, the Crocmen. so we sit through the birds of prey show, the tiger show (which was awesome) and see Bindi perform. She is so cute. We all want to be Bindi when we grow up. She is this super sweet seeming kid, and she knows her facts about animals. Then we kinda look to the VIP section (aka the only place with some shade) and who do we see in the stands. STEVE ERWIN!!!! and his wife and his 2 year old son! At this point, the light really dawned on us as to why Bindi has been facing the same way the entire show. She was performing for her mom and dad! It was so cute, because her parents knew all the songs and dances, and they were doing them in the VIP section. It was so cute. The crocmen...ah, lets just say that one is definately gay, and the others are ambiguous. on eof teh lyrics of their songs is that they are going to save the world, but without wearing tights. 

so, steve erwin, his wife, and this croc handler named wes give us the crocodile show. it is amazing. terri and steve erwin are hilarious. they say some inappropriate things onstage, but they were hilarious. such as when the elephants came out, terri was stradling a fence, and steve erwin goes ""three elephants, but four elephant behinds"" and stares at his wife's ass. She gets off the fence and says if he wants to start making elephants comparisons, well the elephants has a really long trunk. we crack up laughing, and cant believe she said that. steve (saying both his names is too damn long, so just steve from hereon out), puts down his mike and says something to her, and then brings it back up and makes some comment about her being hot today. and it goes back and forth like this. they bring out the crocodile, graham, which steve swears has a thing out for his mate wes. wes apparently was bitten by this croc when they first captured it. he pulled up his khaki shorts and he has these huge scars along the back of his thigh, and apparently on his ass as well. Its funny, cuz it seemed like the crocodile really did have a thing out for this guy. the rest of the handlers would try to tempt it with food, and it would be like, eh. but when this wes guy tried to do anything near it, it would get all fiesty. but these crocs are freaking huge and fast. to show how fast they were, steve jumped into the water, and that croc turned around, got in the water, and was where he was at in no time flat. steve had two of the handlers help pull him out in time to not, well, get eaten. and to get the crocodile out of the arena, he jumped back into the water, and went towards it cage, so as to get it back there. crazy guy. but yeah, we were so excited, because we got to see steve erwin and his family!

and after 3 hours directly under the hot australian sun, during those exact hours they tell you NOT to be in teh sun, i now have a funny tan. niki has a funnier one, because she pulled up her pant legs, so only from knees down are darker. 

we got food, and the prices were of course outrageous, but they gave a lot of good food, so it was worth it. plus, since we were waiting in line, they gave us free ice cream smoothie things because we were waiting. how great is that? we see the tigers again, and see their water show. they have a swimming pool with plexiglass so that the crowd can see the tigers when they are underwater as well. we see other random animals, like the tasmanian devil and the dingos, and some awake koalas. it was an amazing time. completely worth the early morning hours and long transportation. 

but we head back out to the train station in beerwah to wait for the next train. i get this vaguely homeless person feeling because we are sittin on the ground in this podunk town, and it just feels odd. we have a conversation about bindi sue's name  (she is named after a crocodile and a dog), and quality children's tv programs like sesame street and mr. rogers. and not so good ones like boohbah and teletubbies. the wiggles are australian and make more money than nicole kidman. which is wierd. the train gets there, and we nap for a while. then we wake up and just start having the most random conversation. some guy is sittin next to kim, and the poor guy must be traumatized about americans now. i bring up maria and how she cant work at walmart because she failed the integrity test (she said she would not follow orders of her supervisor, if he told her to do something like carry a bucket on her head, they figured this was somehow wrong). that somehow got us into talking about formaldehyde, and sniffing glue or spray paint. the guy is cracking up at us because we are getting excited about these topics. then kim mentions her crush here, and how he is a canadian. the suggestion is that she just attack him. just jump on him and rape him. knock on his door, and say ""shhh"" and cut off the lights and go at it. i get this mental image of kim in a cammo nightie with the facepaint waiting behind some random bush waiting to jump her crush. the guy on the train is nearly choking at this point. but the canadian is also 32 yrs old, and since kim refused to tell us teh age of her parents...well hmmm. we also bring up, of course, tucker max. we tell teh random guy to go on it. to check it out whenever he is bored, or hell, whenever he is just on teh internet. us sharing the tucker max love. :)

so yeah, the trainride was great. i never actually saw the random guy we were talking to. i could only see his shoes, the fact that he was wearing black. and that he had long black hair. nothing else. but then again he spent most of his time with his head down, shakin his head and laughing at us. he probably thinks we are insane. 

tomorrow is syndey. yay! i am worried about this, since i couldnt even coordinate how to get to the australian zoo. if katy wasnt here, i would be so freakin lost. and the fact that my cell phone has officially died since for some reason, it refuses to charge up worries me very much. i do not want to go into a huge ass city without a cell phone. hells no. no no no no. so tomorrow, i need to find some time to go to a store and get it fixed. hopefully, a store will be open. dear god, please let a store be open and fix my phone. plllllleeeeeaaaaaaasssssseeeee. k, so yet again, this was a super long livejournal entry. yet again, most details were so i wouldnt forget them, cuz my memory sucks major ass."

"event","hello everybody! i am starting to hate the damn time difference. right when i need to get going to bed, and i finish sending off emails, such as can i please have a PIN number to get into your dang class, its business hours back in durham, so i end up spending an extra hour on teh computer sending all these damn emails back and forth trying to get various administrative shit out of the way. oh well, fuck it.

on happier news, i have had an effect on australian life. its a small one, but i figure its going to have a whirlpool effect. and to be completely honest, it all started with liza, mexico, and slacking off after lunchtime and before we finished up the days ""classes"". two words. tucker max. i told katy and christina about it earlier in the semester, and they were like, oh whatever, the guy sounds like a dick. then i read one of the stories to katy (the tucker tries buttsex one) and she is laughing so hard she is crying. it then spreads to christina and niki. and they spread it to friends back in their US campuses. then christina tells people in her psych group about it. and now one of the guys is freakin in awe of tucker max. yay for american culture. so my life is now complete since i know i have had an impact upon others. even if that impact was spreading the hilarity and joy of a very big asshole who graduated from duke. i prefer to think of this as i am spreading joy in the world, since you know everyone (just about) who reads that website at one point finds some story that makes them laugh till they nearly pee. 

oh, and also i am going to syndey this weekend! yay! by myself, not so yay. but whatever, its gonna be fun. even if i do live off of...nothing because i have next to no money left. maybe i can buy some peanut butter and eat it out of the jar....hmmm. no. ok, maybe. so, this is me informing people about my plans. if on the 19th, there is no super long entry, i am missing in sydney, please contact my mother. or i may be passed out from sheer exhaustion, so wait for the 20th. :)

i am a waste of space, not doing work, not doing my research, not studying for my midterms, but i am watching prison break, going out, dancing every wednesday night, and generally slacking off on the computer. and enjoying the crazy possums that occupy this campus like squirrels do duke. especially when they sleep on the 4th floor of the physical sciences library during the day, or enter classrooms in search of i dont know what. 

i am getting of and either sleeping or studying....most likely the former, because like i said, i suck."

"event","yay! i finally finished my damn psych report. now that was a pain in the ass. today is my ""i'm on a mental strike, no work for me day."" it started with me being a bum and getting up at 8 am (for here, that is considered late). mainly i got up because they starting mowing the lawn and today is cleaning day so the cleaners were vacuuming the hallways. i turn in my paper super early, and head into the city to get pierced. where i learn teh average price for an industrial piercing is $100. I think clit piercing were cheaper, seriously. so i finally give up and just get it done at a nail salon (agian, i know its strange, or at least to me, that nail salons double as a peircing studio here). i keep forgetting i have the piercing and keep knocking it about when i try to put up my hair. so i am expecting some trouble with it. and for the rest of the day i will continue to be a lazy bum. my only tutorial today doesnt even require much effort. i will be watching honey bees. just staring at honey bees for half an hour. and tonight there is a beach party at the embassy in the city. so yay! no more thinking till monday! although i just discovered the gals are going to moreton bay island this weekend, so i wont have my normal crew of girls to bug when i get bored. this will probably lead me to amusing myself in the city or toowong, which, what the hell, cant be that bad. 

i am on an ipod mission. i am damned and determined to enrol in an ipod course next semester. i dont even care too much for the topic, as long as i get an ipod. i figure i have been paying for the damn things for teh last few semesters, i should get one. so if anyone knows of any classes next semester that are handing out ipods, let me know so i can enrol. i will be perfectly happy to switch around my schedule for one."

"event","ok, so this one phrase has led me to do some funny/stupid/random stuff lately. it started off with me in my animal behavior class needing a ride to elanda pt, a 2 hr drive from brisbane, where we would be conducting our field research for our project. the girl next to me, christine (not the american girl in my college christina), said a friend of hers had a car and was driving. so she turns to him, and tell him to offer me a ride. he looks at me, and says 'sure, i have room to drive you. you keen?' so of course, ride, yes. the day going to elanda, i am exhausted, and half-ass pack, just kinda throwing stuff into a backpack and not really thinking about it (BAD IDEA, u will see why). i meet christine at the bus stop, and we wait for pete, the guy who has the car and is driving. we are going with a second guy as well, thomas, but he lives up by mount coot-tha, so we are picking him up last. the car, first of all, is this faded blue, and from the 80's. i love it. no ac, we roll down the windows for ventilation. reminded me of my childhood, back when i never quite understood the need of ac. we pick up thomas and discover we are quite the international crew. thomas is from austria, here for the semester like me. i of course, US. and christine is from singapore, studying here for 1.5 yrs to finish her degree. pete is the only australian of the bunch, and he is from the freakin outback of new south wales. we are all studying different things (me=psych, christine=molecular cell biology, pete=physics and ecology, and thomas=neuroscience or something, originally chemistry). the drive up there is really fun, we are all talking above the wind. getting sunburned on only one arm. learning random stuff about each other, you know, normal long ass car trip type stuff. oh, and thomas bought along a six pack of XXXX beer, much to the delight of pete and christine. pete asks me if i like beer, and i say i never really got used to the taste. so he asks me if i am keen to give it another go. 

we arive at elanda, and decide since its four of us, we can all just room together in the same cabin. this leads to us also having no shame, and just changing clothes right in front of each other, the boys even un/dressing with the front door wide open. pete has brought this huge sombrero he is wearing to keep off the sun, and we keep stealing it from him because it is freakin hot out there. i had my hot pink fresher hat to wear. watching kangaroos in teh heat is no fun when you dont have shade. pete also gave us gals two of his chairs so we didnt have to sit in the grass. very giving guy that pete. we discover that there is this huge lake right near our campsite, that is also really shallow, not getting any deeper than our knees for the vast majority of it. this is key later in the night. we do our kangaroo bit, watching their vigilant behavior and eating. this is difficult to do, because they keep on jumping around, screwing up our data points, or deciding to take a nap right in the middle of the time period we needed them to eat. it was frustrating. collective groans of ""goddamn it! get up! eat! dont lay down!"" occurred a lot from our group (about 40 people were there from class). we also have to watch these two movies. one on kangaroo behavior, and one of monkeys in ethiopa. both are hilarious in their own way. at this point you should realize, that the tea cups that were to be used for coffee are housing other liquids at this point. thomas has been splitting beers between his and pete's mugs, and they tap our (me and christine's) shoulder throughout dinner, dessert, and the movies to share the beer. if any of us are sick, at this point, we are all getting sick because we have been splitting food and beverages all day amongst the four of us. we get through about 5 cans of beer. i upgrade my drink of choice to hot chocolate, because it was provided, and cold outside. we go spotlighting after the movies, and get to look through night scope binoculors to check out the wildlife. the stars up there were amazing, we could see all of them. or at least to my knowledge all of them. 

christine, pete, and i are too lazy to stand around for the binoculars, so we lay down in teh middle of the dirt road and look for shooting stars. at some point, pete gets the bright idea of going swimming in the lake. at 11 o'clock at night. after drinking beers. with campers all around the lake. unh-huh. then the great question of ""you keen?"" comes up again, and christine and i think, oh what the hell. we say ok, we'll go. a group of people end up coming with us to the lake, about 8 of us in total. i borrow some board shorts from pete to walk to the lake in, but then strip to my undies go right on in. it gave me great comfort knowing that three of teh other girls had to do the same, because none of us expected water excursions. the water is alternatively freezing and warm and really shallow. i manage to stay dry until the other group starts to fling lake mud at one another. and hit me in teh cross fire. either pete or thomas decide then that i might as well get wet, and drag me under the water. christine soon follows. the water is gorgeous,really dark, and teh moonlight was right over it. it looked like a postcard, minus the rowdy uni students in their undies. we stay in the lake for quite a while, just chatting, flinging mud back to one another. when we are shivering because we are so cold, we decide to leave and go shower and go to bed. now, at around this point, i realize i didnt pack an extra pair of undies or bra. now thats fun. i shower, and walk from the shower to the cabin in a towel and tennis shoes (a funny sight, i was told). this entire excursion (minus teh actual showering) was done with the other three, and we were splitting this bag of chicken potato chips (i  shit you not, thats a flavor here) that christine has. we munch on these chips teh entire weekend. 

i put on my night clothes, and get ready to jump into bed. but then someone smells weed. we dont know from where, but we can smell it. again teh phrase ""you keen?"" and we off in search of the source of the weed. we discover that the two french girls beside us were smoking it, so we chat with them for a while. midnight passes, and we finally decide we are going to bed. i get into bed, with only my sheet and nightclothes (i was too dumb to remember a blanket). and i am FREEZING. i cant sleep the entire night. none of us can. at around 2, pete tells me he is toasty so gives me one of his thermal shirts to sleep in. i get out of bed and put on all the dry clothes i brought, and my blue jeans over my jammie bottoms. and i am still freezing. at 6 am they wake us up, and i am so happy because the sun is up and it should be warming up soon. we watch roos for two more hours and then pile up into cars to head back.

instead of heading back to brisbane like most normal folk would have done, we decide to take a roadtrip. we head off to noosa, to go to the beach. that leads to us also going to the national park at noosa head. we are at laguna bay, and the name amuses me because of the show laguna beach. after this we start heading back to brisbane. we stop for some gas (pete decided that instead of paying him for gas, we can all just buy him some beer in exchange), and as we are leaving the station getting back on teh motorway, the car just dies. we get out to push and try to coax the car into working again. it finally works and we head back to brisbane. me and christine are in teh back seat exhausted, and taking short naps in between chatting with the guys. and about half the time when we wake up, we see thomas with a camera, trying to get a picture of us napping. because in their words 'we were so cute, sleeping peacefully. while they were driving and trying to navigate where we were'. and we are putting stickers on one another because we stopped at a fresh fruit market and bought a bunch of apples. so we were calling each other granny smith, pink lady, royal gala, and australian fresh, for about half the ride. 

then we notice that there is an alternate route to brisbane throught the glass mountain range. again teh question ""you gals keen?"" and we take another detour up teh mountains. pete apparently is an outdoorsy person, and has climbed one of them. we decide that over easter break, we are all going to get together and climb up it. so i now have something to do as i am in brisbane, and my american gals are in new zealand. this detour takes about an hour and a half. we go through, take lots of pics, act kinda stupid. and teh car refuses to start up again. so again, us beggin teh car and talking nicely to it, so it will carry us back into the city. it finally starts up again, and we all mutually agree not to shut off the car for the remainder of the trip. we get back safe and sound obviously. 

i really enjoyed being with those three for the weekend. they were fun and goofy, and the guys were not sketchy in the slightest. pete has a girlfriend, so any of yall who were thinking 'finally! rickie met an aussie!"" can get those ideas right back out of your heads. since i apparently wasnt an annoying person to them, i got invited to go climb up the mountain, and join them on an excursion to go see pete's band play a gig sometime in late may. it was nice, and a lot more fun than i expected. i learned some random stuff about singapore and austria, and the price of cigarettes in france and italy. so yeah, fun times. sorry about this entry being so long. i had to tell this story once and forgot half the details, so i didnt want to forget them again. thus the details, probably unnecessary."

"event","ok so a few things to comment on. the first requires some explaining. i have hearing these really strange gnawing noises from my room. it sounds like a hungry animal is chewing their way through my ceiling. so i thought i was going crazy because every time i mentioned this noise to others, they gave me a strange look. but finally christina was in my room and the gnawing began. she freaked out because it is a seriously scary noise. me and the creature have been living in relative harmony, since i havent reported it and it didnt wake me up at odd hours of the night. but then it began to gnaw at 3 in the morning, already a freaky hour if any of yall have seen the exorcism of emily rose or just know random stuff. the next few nights it just keeps on going, and i dont sleep. so i finally report the damned thing. i went to the front office and said ""excuse me, there is an animal living in my ceiling eating at the wood. can someone please do something about this?"" they told me to write that down in the maintenance manual. so the next night, i hear the creature gnawing again, but then it sounds like it is getting into a fight. it screeches and runs about overhead and then periodically makes frantic scrambling noises throughout the night. so either it got into a fight, or it got caught. one way or another, it hasnt been back and i am sleeping again.

also, registration is coming. and i hate the psych classes for fall semester. so i am just taking 2 necessary psych courses so that i dont feel like a total slacker in my major. but for my other classes. there is no rhyme or reason for them. i am trying to talk myself out of ""hip-hop/rap appreciation"" and ""bodies of evidence"". but since i need a CZ course, and all the ones i really like, such as latin culture, conflict with my damn psych classes i am taking a really random course like ""dance and theatre of india"" or something similar. this upcoming semester i feel like a complete slacker since none of my courses i am excited about or look forward to or anything. oh vel. 

hmmm. nothing else new to say. i suck at life. i am going to cairns. i was trying to book a trip to go see Uluru, Kings canyon, and Kakadu national park, but realized that was really hard to do since 2 of the 3 are in the middle of nowhere. and i will be spending summer in a rainforest so i dont really need to see more of them here. so instead i am trying to go to sydney and go up the blue mountains. lets see how that goes. 

formal dinner was good for once tonight. tim and kim got in this argument. tim is waaaaay to metrosexual for his own good. kim (who is this really sporty/athletic fresher) has a very masculine watch. tim informed her that 1) he wouldnt ask her on the date because of the watch and 2) had he asked her out, he would have bought her a new watch since the one she has isnt 'sexy'. this led to whole new argument over tim (and boys in general) being shallow etc etc. it was funny because poor tim finally realized he stuck his foot in his mouth and was frantically trying to save himself at a table full of females. he did a similar thing to me once by constantly insulting americans, then turning around and seeing me standing there. poor guy."

"event","ok, so the week finally ended. i finished my presentation, and i just have two 7 page essays to write. do-able. i finally got to talk to my mother who advised me to travel around australia. for break, i was just going to hang around Brissie, but she suggested I go elsewhere and enjoy myself. Katy and Christina and I booked a weekend to Cairns over my bday to go snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef, so i am excited about that. I am looking into going down to Syndey and seeing the Blue Mountains over break now. Since i have like 2 weeks of no classes. :)

Friday christina and i went to south bank to look for the outdoor salsa thing. find it we did, and it was packed. it was such a mix of people, and i had a great time. granted, we didnt really dance because it was more ""bring the guy you are going to dance with"" type thing, but we still had fun. there were some awesome dancers there, as well as some really bad ones. this one guy kept tossing his girl around, and she was getthing thrown into couples dancing near them. i felt so bad for her, because the guy was off beat and roughing her up. but of course, my luck, he asked me to dance with him. and it was a merengue, so i was like, ok, i can do this, keep myself in a certain space and not hit the surrounding dancers. but this guy starts dancing salsa to the song and i didnt know what to do! so i just kept with the merengue till he finally (about a third through the song) got the hint and asked me what type of music we were dancing to was. christina was laughing her ass off. but she got hers. the guy introduced her to his friend, and said his friend would like to dance. but his friend was bleeding! with the bloody tissue still in his hand. christina was like, ""um, i have to pee."" so of course i accompanied her, it being dark and all. but we came back and hung around a different corner, which was like the pro corner, since the people there were awesome. we ended the night early to catch the last CityCat ferry, and we were starving. i wanted McD ice cream like none other, and christina wanted dominoes. so we ended up being hungry and cold outside of the regatta waiting for a bus, and so freaking tired we were getting delirious. we were each kinda holding our own converstations to each other. 

saturday night we decided to go into fortitude valley aka the valley. which everyone australian told us was very sketchy and dirty. we figured that meant it just might be good. so us, not knowing how the hell to get there take a bus into the city to queenstreet mall. and decide we were hungry and we foudn hungry jacks. but me, being keen, saw a mcd sign and remembering my craving dragged chris to it. and it was a 24 hr McD!!! we were so excited. so we ended up back at all the bus stops after, and decided to ask a random bus driver which stop/bus was for the valley. we got on our bus, and made our way down. lets just say its interesting. lots of bars, clubs, pubs, restuarants,etc. dirty but not disgustingly so. sketchy only because it was massive groups of very drunk people walking around. we wandered about looking for a decent and cheap place to go to. we saw a sign about dance music, free entry, and performances. we kept that place in mind and found birdie num nums (which is supposed to very good and has the nightlink bus stop right across the road). 

so we go back the first place we saw. lets just say, we had an awesome and hilarious night. it turned out that the top floor of the bar was gay/lesbian friendly. they also had better music and $3 basic spirits. the bartenders were these guys wearing white midriff cut shirts. they were dancing to the music as they mixed your drinks. so we were up there having a good time. couples were randomly drunkenly making out. we danced. then chris saw this guy who looked like sloth from the goonies. the resemblance was frightening. and the TOP of our night was when this guy started doing the australian jig to one of the trance hits here. we were laughing so hard it was great. we spent a lot of our time either dancing or watching others dance. we chose our MVPs of the dance floors. hers was sloth and his jig. mine was this really tall skinny asian guy who did a great kelly clarckson trance impersonation. they got really into the music stomping their feet doing the arm thing they do and the jig. theeeeen we find out what they mean by performances. drag shows. we saw the drag queens sprinkled about the bar, but thought nothing of it. no they performed. and it was really really fun. when we are ready to leave and go on to the next bar, we decide to jump downstairs and see how that place was going. 

when we open the door, everyone turns to stare at us. we are kinda uncomfortable so we kinda go in and shut the door behind us. then we see why everyone turned to look at us. the dance floor was empty except for this tim curry (?) look alike wearing a black top and a thong. drag queen of course. and he is performing. his stilletos look like they could be a murder weapon and he is going all over with them and climbs up on one of the podiums with them. about this time we realize that he is performing a song from ""rocky horror picture show"" and he is VERY good at it. he is an awesome performer. so we ended our night there on a happy note after seeing him. him and this other girl who was wearing close to nothing except these hideous hairy boots that looked like she killed several very cute animals for. the boots were moving more than her hips too. 

we leave and go to the RG which is a pub and so smoke filled we left gagging after 2 minutes. we decide we are going to birdie num nums because our feet hurt like hell. we beat the line, and get in in about 5 minutes. we go upstairs and are there for like 30 minutes. the same beat is playing over and over and only the words vary bit by bit. for the whole thirty minutes. there is a girl dancing next to me in heels stomping her feel backwards and several times nearly stomps on me. i am getting very annoyed with her and decided to shover her stomping ass if she gets near me again. a guy on my right is doing i dont know what swinging about like mad, and smack me in the shoulders several times. then he jumps down from his step DIRECTLY onto my foot. and it hurts like hell and i am pissed off. he quickly disappears before i say something, but i did manage a death stare before he left. me and christina are tired of this by now and decide to leave the valley. except that its only 1230 and the next bus doesnt come till one. so we wait next to this guy who keeps complaining because he coudlnt get into birdies. the line for this place is seriously down the freakin block. we manage to get home by about 2 am, but i cant fall asleep for another hour or so. 

i volunteered for the car wash fundraiser for an hour at 9 am on sunday. that was my main activity. my schedule went eat, sleep, carwash, sleep, eat, sleep. i wake up at 430 pm and take a book back to the library and that is it. i am a waste of space today, but i dotn care because for once i am not so zoned out of it and can think a bit clearly."

"event","ok, so i have done about a million livejournal updates. but this one i want to do before i forget everything. and it will be really long, so sorry for all those reading and uninterested.so friday was saint patty's day (hooray!) and i remembered to wear my green although a goodly portion of UQ forgot. At 3:00 katy, niki, and i went to the bus stop to wait for the bus that would take us to our adventure weekend (the location, to me, was still unknown). we were kinda worried because we thought maybe adventure meant that we would be camping out sans toilets, showers, and tents and that freaked us out. a good and bad thing was that a lot of the people who were supposed to come didnt either because they didnt want to, they had work, or they were still at the pubs and wanted to stay or were too damn drunk to come. but that just meant we had a seat to ourselves. but 2 hours later, and about 750 meters higher, we were at Lamington National Park (spelling unknown to me) which is a World Heritage park in Binna Burra. Lamington is also the name of a very delicious cake type thing, and the name is shortened to lammie. The ride up there was very amusing. we saw lots and lots of dairy cows. katy made the best comparison by saying it reminded her of heidi. it was a very apt description.

but we make it the the actual park place and lo and behold, we are not camping out in tents under the trees. well, we were camping out in tents under trees but they were these giant safari tents, had beds, and bunkbeds, and chairs, and dressers, and even electricity! we had a light bulb, but still, that was enough for us. so the three of us stayed in one tent and everyone else got tents as well. we saw a GIGANTIC huntsman spider which was about the size of my hand, and freaked the shit out of all of us. niki who is arachnaphobic was sitting on the bed slightly hyperventilating. katy managed to shoo it out the door and jason came and knocked it into the bush. also, the food was AMAZING. it was kinda ironic that in the middle of nowhere the food, housing, and shower facilities were better than the ones that we get at college, but oh well. we watched a movie (Lantana) and just passed out afterwards. 

Saturday we had a choice of going absailing (dont know how to spell that, but its like reverse rockclimbing, you start off at the top of the cliff, and kinda work your way down) or going hiking/swimming. we went absailing in the morning, so that it would be warmer to swim in the afternoon. we had a practice run on at 10m and also a 40m drop. now, i am scared to DEATH of heights. i freak out on tiny ferris wheels. sophmore year i had issues looking out of my 3rd story window. i seriously hate heights. the hike there was beautiful since it was through subtropical rainforest and ended on a cliff like projection. but i put on the very uncomfortable harness, asked the lady holding onto our safety rope about 10 times, if she was sure she could hold my weight and keep me from plummeting to my very messy death. and i went. the 10 m one freaked me out because i had no clue what to expect. but it was over really quick, after i slighly freaked out at the top because i couldnt even see the walls i was going to be going down, it was that steep. the 40 m one, i was like, okay, i am doing this, lets go! i was the first one down, which probably wasnt the smartest thing to do. there was a small ledge about 10 m down where the rope was pooled, and i was to throw it over the left side and keep going down. the problem was that they meant their left, not my left. so i ended up in trees, and branches, and a very nasty climb down. the rope got stuck at various intervals, and i had to climb my way up and undo it from teh branches. all teh while trying not to look down because the drop extended way below 40 m and i was afraid of dying. but obviously, i survived. the climb back to the top was more frightening. i was alone, and there was no path. a rope was strung leading the way, but it involved lots of climbing, manuevering, swiping spider webs, and holding on for dear life. and did i mention that this was like on the side of a mountain and it was a very bumpy plummet to death? there was barely enough room for me to scrabble up, a few times my feet slipped, and fell over the edge and i was nearly crying. but i went really slowly, and stayed on fours nearly the whole way back up. i was composed by the top and said how intense and fun it was. true, but minus the near crying. 

afterwards, we went to Killarny to go swimming in the swimming hole. i was such a steep hike that i was slipping and sliding the whole way down. katy let me borrow a swim suit so i was trying not to fall on my ass and tear through my shorts and ruin her bathing suit. the swimming hole was amazing though. we stopped off to look at the waterfall that fed into our swimmming hole before finishing the hike down. the water was a greenish color and very murky. at first, we all thought they were kidding and we werent really swimming here. we knew they werent when our guide, jason, and henry (another butler guide) stripped down and jumped in. katy and i were like, alright, and jumped in right after. the water felt so good, it was freezing cold though. we couldnt see where our feet were, and there were random rocks that we could stand out, but had to bang into first. so i have a new array of bruises and scratches to add to my absailing ones. i am also not a very strong swimmer, and very short, so i spent a goodly portion of my time looking for slimy rocks to stand on underwater. there was a mini waterfall that the guys said felt like a back massage, but would rip the swimsuits off of us gals (they still insisted we should try it) but the current to get there was too strong, and we gave up. some of the boys tried to use the rocks that were making the smaller falls as slides. bad idea. they are more bruised on their asses for it. the hike back up teh hill was grueling, since it was all uphill, and all up a very steep hill. henry hung back with me and katy and talked to us about his travels around the US and south america. 

after dinner, it was trivia and bonfire. our group won trivia and we got yo-yos as our winning prize. my contribution to the entire four rounds was the name of our cook and teh american translation of ""can i put my eskie in your boot for a fortnight?"" beyond that i was pretty much useless for trivia. but we still won by 1/2 a point. katy insisted we won because our team name was the dominators (or as jason kept on teasing, the dominatrix) and the other team names were teh kangaroos, the shit house freshers, and the sepos. unfortunately, i had to go pee really really badly. it was about 10 at night, and the nearest bathroom i knew of was back at teh campsite down teh road (about a 10 minute walk). so i borrowed a flashlight and walked. bad idea. every single horror movie i had ever seen kept flashing through my mind and i was looking around but couldnt see anything. and to top it off int he bathroom, there was another damn huntsman spider (or at least i hope it was, it had a skull on its back, and was big and scary looking). but i had to pee so bad, i was like, fuck it. i dotn bother you, you dont bother me. the walk back was better since the moon came out and i could see better. we had a bonfire and some australian bread (darka or something) with golden syrup which was delicious. 

sunday! (i am nearly done i swear it) we go hiking. and not a nice peaceful hike. a 11 km hike (about 6.9 miles) to go see the waterfalls. it was a hike through the subtropical rainforest, to the cliffs, to the waterfalls. and it was amazing. it was gorgeous, and beautiful, and every other word that cant describe the sheer beauty of the place. the waterfalls (and tehre were several) wore absolutely stunning. a guy we were with (he was our MVP for trivia, name of jeff i think) said they were some of the most gorgeous falls he had seen, and he had seen a few. we kept hiking to the creek which was so clear with lots of rocks to climb on it was just great. the hike back was painful though, and at the end, i couldnt feel my legs, feet, nothing. katy and i were slow hikers and the last to go. the last 1.5 km there was a fork in the road, no one was around, and we had no clue which way to go. katy made teh decision and teh entire way we were frantic looking for familiar signs. we finally figured that we were on the right path because we passed some hikers that told us they saw a huge group in front of us. so we stopped worrying. 

so that was my weekend. it was amazing, and i had a blast. katy and niki were kind enough to take pics of me throughout teh time, so i need to find those pictures and set them up on facebook or something. but my body hurts, and my brain needs to get fixed on this damn presentationt that is due (ahhhhhhhh!) on tuesday. so adios, and so sorry for teh long entry. i hope whoever reads this read it in increments."

"event","ok, so for me to bitch would be slightly hypocritical since i put my self in this position, but i am still stressed out. 25% of my grade for one of my classes in on a presentation and essay, both are due in the next two weeks, followed by another research paper for another class. soooo, i am slightly stressed since i wont be here this entire weekend. i am going to some national park on the gold coast to go hiking and what not with Butler. and i paid for this shit, so by god, i am going. but yeah, i am done bitching now.

i am kinda getting over getting sick. i have felt like i have been on drugs for the past week. no concentration, and all i wanted to do was sleep. i measure my energy by how long it takes me to climb to the second floor of my wing...and yeah, its been taking a while. so i am kinda cranky that i am sick. me no likee. 

the highlight of my week though! turns out the mexican guy that i swore was familiar actually is! I remembered his name was carlos something (its carlos daniel) and he attended UDLA. so yay! its a small world after all. i was at the wednesday dance social thingamajig and i saw him, and he looked like he was about to go (he had his backback and all) and i *scurried* after him and tagged him, and asked him if he attended UDLA. and he was like yeah, he did, that he remembered me (since he had to guide me home once cuz i couldnt remember my address, but i had only been living htere one day! and he also accidentally called me once in the states cuz he brother has my name) etc etc. so i was happy. so that has placed me in a better mood. and i learned teh charleston. that is one funny aerobics dance. katy made me be the guy for merengue which was interesting since these australian chicks are quite tall, and i had to stand on my tiptoes in order to twirl any of them. but overall fun wednesday, even if prison break was cancelled to show the parade of teh commonwealth games."

"event","last night christina and i went to friday's. and lets just say that we learned what it would have been like if we had gone to clubs in the 90's, 80's, and possibly portions of the 70's. and of course they played 'sexual healing' and 'like a prayer' which seem to be mandatory at all clubs. anywho, we found out that there is an all night bus service which is awesome. we finally got home at around 3 am where the funniest part of my night occurred. some king's boys were drunk and getting their way back to their college and were singing as they passed emmanuel. and the song goes like this 

i'm from emmanuel and i'm inbred (the second guy repeated this line and all the following lines)
i like to sleep with my dad in bed
i like my mom to give me head
cause i'm from emmanuel and i'm inbred

which to me at 3 am is friggin hilarious. but yeah anywho the next morning at like 7 am i was up again and getting ready to go to lone pine koala sanctuary. it was an awesome place. koalas everywhere. granted, they were mostly sleeping, but they were soooooo cute. and i got to cuddle a koala and get my picture taken. i look horrendous, but the koala is adorable. 

we also got to go to the kangaroo reserve and pet some kangaroos, wallabies, and wallaroos. they were so sweet and cute. they were just kinda chillin in the shade, and you could sit right among them. we bought kangaroo feed for 50 cents and fed most of them. they ate it right out of your hands so delicately. except for the giant male kangaroo with the huge balls (if i get a pic, y all see what i mean). that one drooled excessively and was kinda gross. but he was the only one. the rest were very dainty in their eating. 

we also got to see some dingoes, various birds, crocodiles, a death adder, a tarrin (the worlds deadliest snake though i dont know how to spell its name) and various other animals. except the tasmanian devil which was not there. and that was sad. but we did get to see lots and lots of goannas running around. and the crazy ass wild turkeys that chased each other for food. and the violent emus that tried to peck at your earrings as you walked past. but overall it was a very fun and exciting place to go. koalas and kangaroos are much more complex animals than i ever thought. but yeah, so now i am off to go try not to be a waste of space. it kinda sucks that everyone is on spring break back at home and i am barely starting my third week here. but i am happy for everyone back at home because i know they have been working their asses off while i was back at home with nicolas and ray. everything has its price i guess.

also, nicolas is getting big. i was talking to my mum on the phone, and she told me that while at the wic office, yuly asked nic to sit down and be a good boy. he was previously running about like mad with this other little boy. so nic sat down and was quietly playing. the other boy came up and tried to get him to play again with him, but nic said ""no. i am a good boy right now"" so omg my brother is getting so big!!! realizing what is good behaviour and bad and everything! so yeah, my baby brother is getting  big. :("

"event","ok, so i have no friggin clue what secs actually stands for, but they throw one hell of a party. thursday night buses were loaded up and took us to chalk hotel, one very fancy schmancy place. it had endless floors, and i counted about five bars. and since i have a strange tendency to judge a place by the bathroom. well, they had an opaque automatic door that swished up whenever you approached it. needless to say it took me a while to find this bathroom because i just figured that opaque-ness was part of teh wall. yeah...i'm a genious i know. but it was by far one of the best times i have had here. they played pretty recent music, and held back on the ""shake what your mama gave you"" and other similar songs. we danced so friggin much though, that we were literally dripping in sweat. sexy, i know. but then the nice dance floor because this near mosh pit situation. people were shoving everyone rudely. idiots kept on coming onto the dance floor when they damn well knew that there wasnt any room, and walking and shoving their way through only to leave again. and this 6 foot 5 guy and similarly tall friends were dancing next to katy and me and they kept shoving us and leaning back on us and everything. so we shoved them back to get the hell off of our heads (they were that tall...we were that short, it was a bad situation). and then they had the fuckin balls to give us dirty looks?! wtf. so by that time we were like fuck it. the fun is gone we are now annoyed and more than pissed off. so we just took a maxi back to college. 

so the next night, since christina missed out on the secs fun, me and her made our way to the RE. we were thinking about going to teh valley, but the place is supposed to dodgy, we have no fucking clue how to get there, and we were only two girls. we took the smarter path and went somewhere that we knew how to get back from. and that was fun in its own way. it was chill and laid back. everyone was casually dressed sittign around with friends and drinking a jug. they had these two guys playing live music and they were very very good. so i enjoyed myself just sitting and listening to live music. 

also, plans for this sunday is to go to the koala sanctuary at lone pine. i am excited! although a picture with a koala may not seem as exciting as jorge's picture with a baby lion i think it was, people forget that a pissed off koala can tear off your face. dont fuck with teh koalas. :) so heres hoping the weather permits this trip."

"event","ok, so here is something for liza and takiyah. or anyone who reads this who went to UDLA with us. so during orientation, they make all the people from their respective countries stand up. and there are maybe like 7 people from mexico. anyways, one of them looks a little familiar but it was such a quick glance that this didnt get too much of my attention. buuuutttt, then i am walking back from one of my classes and i see one of the guys who stood up for the mexico crowd, the one who looked familiar. and i swear to god, this guy looks like on of our animadores (i have no clue how to spell that word, but yall know who i am taking about...what nacho was). this guy frighteningly resembles one of them. i think he had two names, like juan carlos or something like that. he looked a bit like wolverine, he was kinda hairy. he ended up dating one of the tall, athletic, blonde american girls. but i dont know if it is him. he just looks ALOT like him. i am so tempted to go and ask him if he attended UDLA and find out if it was him. but as yall can easily tell this is bothering me. the probability of it being the same guy is really really small but oh well. it would be a funny coincidence if it was."

"event","there are lots of creep noises here. for example, the birds. one sounds like a monkey and insists on ""chirping"" at 5 in the morning. another one sounds normal, and then all of a sudden it sounds like you threw it in the water and its drowning. or possibly deflating. another one sounds like a child getting strangled. and the list goes on. my favorite birds right now are the ones with a long ass beak that they use to sword fight each other with. they live above the carpark outside of my window, so if i ever get bored i can look out and see some bird fencing. also, there is something making noises in my room. you know all the horror movies, where the girl hears a creepy scratching noise and investigates and then dies a horrible horrible death? its that kind of noise. and its coming from the corner of my room directly above my bed. so i have a few ardent and fervent wishes. one, that it is a rat or a bird and not anything that is shown in horror movies. second, that it doesnt eat through the ceiling and fall on my face as i am sleeping. cuz that would be very very very bad.

i went to the market on saturday. it was fun. we found some bottle openers that are attached to a kangaroo's scrotum. i wanted to buy one but didnt know who i would give it to. who can i give a gift to and say ""hey, here's a kangaroo scrotum. hope you like it. try not to get the hair in your beer""?

i finally dropped my intro to pathology class. i am so excited. i am taking an animal behavior class now and we are taking a field trip up to noosa. if i mentioned this already, i am sorry, but i am still excited. 

niki and i have discovered a way to amuse ourselves while on campus. so, here in australia, there are a lot of skinny girls. well, not skinny, not thin, more along the lines of anorexic. these girls have no thighs, ass, hips, stomach, breast, anything. the biggest part of their legs is their knees which bulge out in comparison to their thighs and calves. its frightening. very frightening. i have a suspicion that they buy their jeans from teh childrens section because no female adult could possibly be that thin. that and i think they may be on crack. just a theory. but niki calls them ""ethiopians"". i guess that could be rude, but what other country has such skinny rail thin people, and we cant very well call them anorexics when they are within hearing distance. now that just rude. but gaby knows of my everlasting temptation to go up to these girls and shove ice cream down their throats.  

nothing else is new. classes, more classes, more readings, etc. going out is a different experience. i told marisol about this already. here, in teh clubs, for the majority of the time, guys dotn come up to girls and dance with them. dancing here is a big thing. it means that you are pretty much going home with that person and spending some ... quality time together. no one explained this to us though. so if a guy is dancing with you, he is not close at all. christina jokes that a guy could be dancing with  you and having a blast, and thinking that yall had a great time together, but the girl doesnt even realize that she was dancing with him because he was like six feet away (a slight exaggeration, but you get the point). guys dont buy drinks for girls either. different strokes for different folks i guess.

oh, i can receive free text messages on my phone. so if you put me on aim, feel free to text message my phone with any random little thing. as i learned, when i send a text message teh same one pops up like 20 times on the recipients phone. i am sorry for that, i swear i only push send once. 

doing better here. feeling a bit left out, a little replaced. but i am hoping that is normal homesickness and not reality. because if it is...well that just sucks for me."

"event","ok, so i really dont have much to say about bush walking unfortunately. although katy did remind me that for our adventure weekend we will go bush walking. which made us all very excited :). but it is week one of classes and i am exhausted. i was taking this intro to pathology class which i thought would be totally amazing. and which completely kicked my ass. i was extremely unprepared for exactly how necessary all those prereqs would be. so, i switched out, in typical undecided me fashion. i am now in animal behaviour, and we get to take a trip some weekend to watch kangaroos and their vigilant behavior. so i am in a much better mood. i told katy and niki that it reminded me of when i dropped bio as a minor. the relief and the happiness completely washed over me. because seriously, i am in a foreign country taking awesome classes duke isnt offering, and one is making me so miserable and so stressed out in the first TWO days that i just want to cry. so i am happy now. 

its raining like mad outside. it was like they tease us with the hot weather where you felt like you would die of heat exhaustion if you dare walk in an area without shade...and then it rains so freakin much i feel like a hurricane is coming near. i do believe the weather here is a wee bit bipolar. 

oh, UQ dance! i completely forgot. so as my own personal reward for going to a prac at 5 at night and missing dinner, i went to the juice bar where uq dance was meeting and dancing merengue and whatnot. so i go, and the place is absolutely packed, there were seriously more than 300 people out there. and it was lots of fun. granted no one was an expert dancer, but i am not good anyway so it didnt really matter. i take that back. there was this one couple that was very good.but, i had fun dancing with this guy named brennan who told me that on friday nights, people salsa dance outside at southbank. so i am excited, and hopefully, if i dont pass out from exhaustion, i will go this friday. i was so hyped up from hearing music and dancing around that i did the most idiotic thing. i walked ""through the bush"" of uq to get back to college. i heard this strange rustling noise and freaked out. as i frantically looked around me (because i am oh so calm in any situation) i realized that it was this giant possum trying to scramble up a tree making all the noise. thank you aussie wildlife for giving me a heart attack. 

so after all this, me and katy decide to veg out in front of a tv and watch whatever was on. which happened to be prison break. the guy, michael schofield on the show, is absolutely gorgeous! katy and i just sat and watched the show because of his beauty. and we plan to continue watching this show just to watch him. good casting gets me every time. i am a shallow person. 

i am not much getting into this whole australian perspective. i am getting an international one, but not australian. most of the people i meet are from china, singapore, korea, india, etc. so that is a bit disconcerting. but what the hell. its all good anyways. what is odd, is that i am in a country where i can legally drink, people party on monday night (i shit you not) and i not only dont go out all the often, but i dont drink when i do. this partially has to do with the fact that i would not be able to find my way back drunk like i can at duke, but also that apparently drink spiking is a huge thing here. and i would rather not...encounter any problems? i guess that is a good way to put it. but anywho, i have a date with a tv now that i am no longer stressing over pathology."

"event","So, for the past week it has essentially been getting situated. And by getting situated I mean ignoring the morning wake up calls, trying to learn a schedule to get to the shower before all the freshies, finding out where the hell the ferry can let you off at, and finding local bars that arent saturated with 18 year olds who are out of the house and on their own for the first time. We managed to find a club type place/ casino in the Indooroopilly Hotel aka the Indo Ho. It was a theme night centered around Cancun parties. I was seriously expecting a wet t-shirt contest, but one did not present itself. While waiting for the ever elusive Indo bus, we saw this guy walking around the corner and heading for the local shopping store. He looked kinda shady, was wearing shorts that were falling of his ass, and nothing else. no shoes, no shirt, no problem. We got all excited because we were like, ""he's a kingsman (a guy who lives in kings college the all male college)! I bet they are gonna make him streak or something"" me and niki (a girl from d.c.) were gettign all excited because we have never seen a streaker before, like seriously. we were watching this guy with the most avid interest, only to be sorely disappointed. no streaking. but his pants did keep falling dangerously low. so we make it to the indo hotel, and are so exciting because they are playing hip-hop. and it was fairly recent hip-hop. they even played daddy yankee gasolina, and even though i am sure the aussies had no clue what the song was about they were dancing along in their own special way. the hip hop slowly died down, only to be replaced by...you guessed it. techno and old songs. we heard the creepy ""shake what your mama gave you"" song that i think is actually called ""i love the way you move"" and i shit you not, they played sexual healing and thriller. 

Nothing else to exciting has happened. We rode the ferry at night and saw brizzie by nightime. it is gorgeous. we walked through the out door mall, and didnt get run over even though we had to cross the road about 10 times. ice cream cones and Hungry Jacks were only 30 cents so i was happy. and we are all having lots of fun saying ""in the bush"". without fail, in most of our conversations we can work that phrase in it somehow. unfortunately for me, the bush seems to hate me. i am the lucky person who gets crapped on from the many bats and birds in all the freakin trees around here or who walks into huge ass spider webs. 

today, i went kayacking in byron bay, which is this tiny little hippie town in new south wales. we were gonna go sea kayacking and look for wildlife. unfortunately, the dolphins have other priorities this time of year. they are getting busy elsewhere (mating season and all that). but even in the shallow water you saw silver fish darting about. the water was clear and you could see your feet in teh water, a huge change from galveston bay. but back to the kayacking. yeah...i didnt cut it. you had to paddle like mad trying to get past the waves. and if your kayack was a little turned or if the person in front (me) didnt lean down low enough ot cut the surface area or if the person in teh back didnt paddle hard enough the wave crashed into you and capsized the kayack. so we would get pretty far out, and get to the very last wave which completely slammed over us and capsized us. this happened twice. and both times we had to frantically try to push the kayack and the paddles back to a high enough sand dune that i could get my short ass back in teh kayack while not drowning in the waves. after that second time i said screw it. i had enough near death experiences thank you very much. so i played in teh ocean water for teh remaining time at bryon, and i am okay with this. 

one cute thing here is that no one can pronounce my name. the aussies seem to be compelled to pronounce my name ""rick-KAY"". think of forrest gump saying ""jennie"" and that is kinda what is sounds like. i didnt really notice till my wing leader, blake, knocks and my door and says ""rick-kay are you coming to toga?"" when i told him no, he was ""why rick-kay? this is one of the biggest parties of the year. you have to come rick-kay"" thats when the pronounciation hit me. yes i know i am slow. 

other than that, everything is okay here. the homesickness is starting to hit me pretty damn hard. not only do i miss all my sucias and all the good times, i miss home a lot too. i got accepted into the costa rica ethnobiology program, and i am seriously considering not doing it. joshua's baby is due on july 4 and the program starts july 3. little ray had a horrible week at school when i left, and his teacher even had to set up a teacher parent conference because she was worried about him. every single time i leave i get depressed because i know it upsets my family. but i know that they are completely capable of living life without me and i am not a necessary fixture of the home. i know that me being in N.C. or me being in Oz is just about the same, because I dont see them for four months no matter where i am, but it is rougher now because I dont have my sucias and i dont have my routine. I know in a few weeks I will be like ""i love australia, i dont want to go yet"" but getting to that point will require a bit more effort. but for now, i am going to take my stiff, sore, tanned, sun-burned in the oddest places, and exfoliated self to bed. i am a loser, yes i am aware of this too."

"event","Ok, just so everybody knows, I hate you Gaby, I hate  you. And you know why. I called you to tell you why. So for everyone else, here is the past two weeks of my life. 

I arrived in Brisbane after travelling for more than 24 hours very dirty and very tired. But i was in australia so yay! Loaded up on a bus to head out for a 2 hour drive to the Noosa Resort on the Sunshine coast to get over jetlag and be slowly introduced to the aussie way of life. The fun part is when the bus starting buzzing...and the buzzing got louder. and our driver started to freak out and get worried. we pulled into a gas station and the driver got out and looked around. when he re-entered the bus, he still looked a bit worried, but started up the bus. it started to buzz again. He put on some music to drown out the buzzing, which was the best idea i must say. and then...it started to rain...and our windshield wipers didnt work. needless to say the 30 americans on the bus were freaking out becuase we are driving down a major highway in the rain with no wipers. fun times. but since i am still alive yall know nothing tragic happened. oh, except we jumped a few curbs and later discovered that the breaks went out for about an hour and a half of the drive which thank god they never informed us of. 

noosa resort was fabulous. in the morning a family of kangaroos kinda chilled on our back porch. one even had a joey in its pouch and they were so adorable! peacocks wondered about as well. we had surfing lessons on the beach, where we learned that beaches are also highways so watch out as you exit before you get run down. a man who worked with steve erwin came to show us some of the wildlife we may encounter is brisbane, and some aboriginees came and performed dances. we went to fraser island which is AMAZING. we swam in lake mackenzie which is the most beautiful lake i have ever been in. crystal clear water with white sand. gorgeous. and we went through the rainforest portion of the island as well. after a few days we come to our respective unis.

i am staying in emmanuel college, the largest one on campus. and it is o-week. this by the way, is why i hate gaby. its all cool, and tehn the freshies arrive. and they are about 17 years old. and they are getting hazed....and so are we. 5 in the morning i hear barking and someone screaming ""wake up you freshies! wake up!"" it was kings college, right behind us, starting orientation. then at 530, i hear screaming in my hallway, which i purposely ignore. then at 6 the most horrid sounding upbeat techno starts to BLAST throughout the hallways. and guys painted head to toe in blue run up and down the halls screaming their lungs out and banging on our doors (a few frames were busted when people didnt open up quick enough). we also have to wear these pink hats with our codenames on them. mine, obviously is Boxer. Acosta sounds similar to the name of a champion boxer here. but, we have to wear these hats our we get our faces painted blue and read an apology note to the group. so we file out and go to the terrace by the river (which has sharks in it fyi) where we do dance aerobics of some sort. the next day it is running. today was to dance, learn songs, and get doused in flour and water. fun times. 

but this has been all fun and games. hazing isnt too bad besides the horrid music and ungodly hour. we had our formal dinner where we got to wear these harry potter type robes and had wine served to us and delicious food. afterwards we did a strange song and dance. it started of with leg kicks to ""i'm singing in the rain"" some hopping, and then the gradual sequence of arms out, wrists flop, elbows in, knees together, heads down, tongue out, pants down. and then us singing 'arushka' or something like it. no girls didnt drop their pants but all the guys did. i have never seen so many guys with their pants down as i have in this college. at formal dinners, during morning jazzercise, at the clubs, in the bars, they seem willing to drop their pants at anytime. thank god most wear boxers. 

so that is a real quick, if very lengthy overview of oz. i left out about half. such as james bond trivia night where we had to wear our cocktail dresses. oh, and being called a ""sepo"" at the drop of a hat. american is replaced by the word sepo which is short for septic tank...cuz americans are full of shit. and for all my sucias, yall are doing a crappy job of keeping me updated! i need more info, even i can only check my mail once every coupla days and after 5pm. so cheers."

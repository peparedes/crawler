"event","Sitting on her back steps now. Its a beautiful sunny day. There is a chill in the air that makes the sun precious. I'm too used to the sun being something to avoid too much of. To desire it now is a new experience. I left the door open while taking the garbage out. Her 18yr old indoor cat trepidaciously looked outside a world he's never known. I decided to sit with him. 18 years is old for a cat. 

This house would be nice if not for all her odd rules and hang ups. I suppose everyone feels that way about everyone and everything. She fears loosing things. She fears people taking away what is hers. She fears not having enough. She balances her fear of mess and filth with her fear of things being taken from her by hiring me.

I balance my fear of not having money, of being in debt, of doing the same thing in the same place and never finding myself with my fear of... everything.

It is nice to sit here. I wish she wouldn't lock the doors all the time and demand the same of me. I wish she wouldn't set the house alarm all the time. To run through a door on a whim, to sit on porch step on a sunny day without premeditation. How wonderful. In this way i miss the trailer."

"event","So, it has been about five months since i've joined the Mac occult.&nbsp; I felt MANY mixed feelings for a very long time about making the switch.&nbsp; I know that the Mac is overpriced, in so far as the amount of memory and storage etc. compared to the market price of comparable pcs.&nbsp; My last computer was a Dell with XP.&nbsp; After trying to navigate vista on my parents computer and getting completely angered with it as it is as a counter-intuitive frustration device, i decided that anything would be better than this.&nbsp; If i were a bit more savvy, i'm sure i would have opted for a linux operating pc.&nbsp; 

So i feel this growing guilt that i'm paying for the sleek ads Mac puts on tv.&nbsp; I guess i hate the idea of paying for a brand, in whatever context.&nbsp; I don't wear brand clothing that self advertises.&nbsp; However, i am quite fond of adapting simplicity in my life.&nbsp; And Macs are that.&nbsp; I don't know that i've sworn out of frustration in the failure to perform even once since i've had my lovely.&nbsp; 

But like a tatoo, people adorn themselves with the bitten apple logo as though it might imbue their lives with beauty and simplicity.&nbsp; Counter-intuitively the Mac suggests that More is Less.&nbsp; That our lives will begin once we have the latest gadget.&nbsp;"

"event","Sometimes i worry that i don't feel things the way i'm supposed to.&nbsp; I feel like everything that is beautiful sort of skips over me, like water over a duck.&nbsp; I get the sense of what it is i should feel, but it doesn't resonate with me the way it is ""supposed"" to.&nbsp; 

When i go to hear music, or go to art shows, or see sunsets or see babies, or taste chocolate or wine, i can't escape this feeling that i am somehow experiencing a numbed version and everybody else is experiencing the real deal.&nbsp; People are brought to tears by the arts because it touches them so deeply.&nbsp; So i feel like i'm supposed to fake it.&nbsp; I'm supposed to say how wonderful everything is when in reality it wasn't even bad enough for me to hate it strongly, passionately.&nbsp; It's just sort of there.

I guess it's funny that i'm in the arts then.&nbsp; When i really don't care about art at all.&nbsp; How can you make yourself care?&nbsp; Where does caring come from?&nbsp; Maybe all of my interest in art has come from my recognition that making art objects moves other people in ways i will never be moved, which in turn moves me to a lesser degree.&nbsp; From the first shitty drawing that wound up on mom's fridge, i've been making things to try to feel some trickle down of passion ignited in others.&nbsp; But chances are, mom was just trying to be nice and she thought your drawing was crap but she loved you.&nbsp; 

Maybe we are all lying to spare each other.&nbsp; We are all happily gobbling up crap and calling it candy because life without passion is worse that admitting we're eating shit."

"event","I've never been one to drop the ""L"" bomb too fast.&nbsp; It fact, i find that word sticks in my throat.&nbsp; I mean i've said ""I love you"" before, but it seems like people drop that line so quick these days.&nbsp; Its like they long for love and then they call it like shotgun before it slips away in the night.&nbsp; I think i'm just too skeptical for all that.&nbsp; On the back of the head rest on the seat of the greyhound in front of me, i stared at ""I heart Brittney 4 life"" all the way until Dallas.&nbsp; There was something desperate about it.&nbsp; Scrawled in permanent marker, i seriously doubted that this statement still held any truth, only serving as a relic.

I think the problem is when people decide on love as a solution, or anything for that matter, as a solution."

"event","Today my stupid cat freaked out for no reason.  She jumped up onto the bar and then wormed her way behind my glass vase that i bought at tj maxx last year because i thought it was really pretty and i don't usually like things like that but this time i did... when i came closer to keep the vase from falling, she freaked out and ran out the door.  The vase couldn't be more broken.  It spun around three times before it fell.  I felt like god looking down on the misery of the world, unable to stop it or unwilling.  Everything i dare to love turns back into the sands of its origin.  Maybe i just need to hurry up and love this fact instead of feeling abandoned by it."

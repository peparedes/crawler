"event","Wow tonight was definitely one of the best nights of my life. Me and Holly had the BEST time today. Basically I woke up and did a few chores and talked to Holly for a bit and then went to her house at like 3 and we hung out and watched mtv or whatever and had spontaneus pillow fights till about 6:30 and then we left to go see shrek 2 which was funny! And we watched more of that movie than we ever had which is like a record! We must have watched about 3/4's of it! It was amazing! But yeah afterwards we went back to her house and I taught her how to make rice krispy treats which was fun. And I began to clean up and wash the dishes when lil ol Holly decides to pick a water fight. (bad mistake) so me and Holly go at it for like 10-15 minutes and I get her drenched and I'm pretty wet myself and my mom stops by and tells me to go home so I gather my things and leave at about 10:45 and come home and waddya know I talk to Holly again! hehe. But yeah today was friggin awesome.

"event","DUDE today was amazing. Okay, Dave (Holly's step dad) isn't TOO fond of me, I mean he likes me (I guess from what Holly's mom and Holly tell me) but yeah I still thought he hated me. And he's really protective of Holly, as is her mom, and she was grounded and she had mono for a long time and shes just recovering from both. Tommorow she gets ungrounded. But yeah anyways back to the story, Dave usually would never do this (so says Holly) but today HE invited me over for dinner!! I was freakin out dude I was like holy bajesus he just invited me for dinner and Holly is grounded that is amazing! But yeah Holly's mom like practically loves me which makes things better for me and Holly but yeah. I just wrote her a 1 and a half page long note showing my excitedness etc etc. But yeah that was my excited story for the day BWAHAHAHAAAAA
peezy, leezy, and beezypeezy marshmeezy's

"event","But yeah, more about last night. Last night was an AWKWARD NIGHT. At my band practice when I first got there some people were gonna stop by. So Kasi and Carissa come by and then Kristine and Antonin and Joey stop by. Now for those of you oblivious to the recent dilemma. I'm dating Joey's ex-girlfriend and they dated for a year and 8 months and he hated me for a long time and continuously hates me on and off now and last night we were awkwardly looking at each other last night and then things settled down he gave me a hug and we were kinda chillin and then they left and we jammed a little and then we went out and jumped on the trampoline and went inside afterwards to get some food and play dark tag. Then we made some jello, one was strawberry kiwi and the other was sugar free apricot (sick shit chubbs). But MMYESS it was dandy fun.
GBYE

"event","I had a really really good time today hangin out with my little sister Steph (shes not my sister haha and she is 4'9(little)) and Kelli and Zaq and Ryan. But yeah regardless of that I really really miss Holly. I don't know why but shes been grounded for a week and I haven't been able to see her outside of school for near a month now and I don't know how much more I can take it without just going over there haha. But yeah I really really miss her and sometimes I feel like shes dissapointed in me or is really jealous or something and I really don't want her to feel that way but I can't tell when she is and isn't and I really hope that I can be able to tell in the future when that happens and I wish that her mom lets me drive her this summer to the concerts and stuff. But, Holly if you're reading this I love you and I miss you so much! But yeah today was a fun day besides my extreme longing to see my girlfriend. Last night was an amazing band practice since we hooked up the lights to the amps so when we play the lights flash to what we are doing. And me and Jeremiah and Bryce and Zaq and Antonin and Aaron (zaqs bro) stayed up till like 4 or 5 making jello and playing dark tag. And then we turned around and woke up at like 6 or 7 cuz we are retards. But yeah then I went home and did yardwork and then I picked up Steph and Kelli and we met Zaq at his house and then we came back to my house and then Ryan came over and we watched 2 movies and then we went to Zaq's to jump on his trampoline and then we came back and ate hamburgers and then unsuccessfully tried to light a bonfire because the damn wood was wet. Maybe some dumb ass bird pissed all over my firewood. But yeah then I took Steph and Kelli and Zaq and Ryan over to Kelli's house to take Steph and Kelli home and we chilled there and talked on Kelli's driveway for a bit and then me and Zaq and Ryan drove home and stopped by Harbour Market and got some drinks and I saw all my working fellows and then we came back and sat and gawked at the Pacer game oblivious to what was actually happening. And then Ryan and Zaq left and Adam left also and here I am now explaining to my computer what I did today and how I felt about my lover and how I miss her incredibly and wish I could just hold her and kiss her right now but I fuckin can't because shes not here but that's okay because I have to live with it and if she was supposed to be here then she would but obviously it wasn't meant for her to be here today so yeah just gonna have to cope with it. But yeah I'm done now so Holly I love you and I hope I see you soon. CYA KIDDIES, peace love and bulletproof marshmellows.

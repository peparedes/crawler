"event","Well, I'll give a bit of post-Christmas update and such.

Christmas went fairly well.  Save for my Dad being sick with bronchitis followed by my sister being sick with the flu of course :P.  I flew home from CA on the 22nd to find out Dad was sick, then my sister got sick the 23rd :-/.

She was well enough for she and I to see <u>I Am Legend</u>, which I will post a review of later.

For Christmas I got an Air Action 2008 calendar (of military aircraft), and my sister got me <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Capcom-13388330027-Lost-Planet-Condition/dp/B000G75AXY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1199151012&sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">Lost Planet: Extreme Condition</a> for the Xbox 360, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fury-Star-Wars-Legacy-Force/dp/0345477561/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199151237&sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"">Star Wars: Legacy of the Force: Fury</a> by Aaron Allston (7th book in the series), <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Generation-Tom-Brokaw/dp/0385334621/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199151432&sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"">The Greatest Generation</a> by Tom Brokaw, some long-sleeved shirts from Old Navy, and a Aslan bookmark (Aslan being the lion from Chronicles of Narnia for those not in the know :P).  

I got Dad <u>The Simpsons Movie</u> and a Boeing pen, and I got my sister a couple of Wii games. a Boeing pen, a Boeing digital watch, and Marshmellow, this cute cuddly bear from Borders.  Many people got that gift, including Jodo (<lj user=""nomadicsnowman"">), Molly (<lj user=""sabergirlmcl"">), Thom (<lj user=""majormagik"">), and 4 others from NS.  I also gave Thom a year subscription to <u>The Economist</u>.  Hopefully that will help with his write in-campaign.

For many others, I sent Amazon.com gift cards and other e-cards and well wishes.  All told, my bill reached around...US$940......damn I didn't break a grand w00t! :P

Only minor thing about Christmas that annoys the hell out of me is that when I tried to install <u>Crysis</u>, the bastard CD fucking crashed my laptop!  Sorry that my laptop's Core 2 Duo is .2 gigs shy of the box requirements but it can still do well on the other parts!  *sigh* Now I'm stuck with this game, that I can't play on either computer, much less install, without risking another BSOD :(.  Does anyone want the game? 

The next day I went and saw <u>Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem</u>.  OMG you will definitely be seeing a review of this movie :D.

After much arguing with my dad I was finally able to get a rental car to be able to do errands for the time I was home in PA and hang out with people. My sister drove back to Stamford, CT as she had work on 27 Dec.  

I finally met Alex aka Soly (from the NS region of Taijitu), who flew all the way from Finland, even after being re-routed from France (damn you Air France >_<) to visit me and Alana, another of my best friends from that NS region.  We ate some oriental food at Z.wei, this Chinese/Japanese/Thai restaurant and sushi bar in Exton.  Soly finally got to try sushi, which I think he enjoyed ^_^.  Alana enjoyed her gift of Marshmellow the bear, which she will now apparently put beside her penguin at home, and we finished off a fun evening with seeing <u>The Golden Compass</u>.  The review of this movie will feature BEAR CAVALRY, though I will already point out that the amount of sexual innuendo that Alana, Alex, and myself noticed throughout the movie was highly disturbing, yet so fucking hilarious XD.

Unfortunately, the rest of the weekend was crap as I then got a mild flu, care of my dad, who's still suffering from bronchitis as of today but is much improved compared to 22 Dec. when I first flew in.  I'm getting a bit better now as well, after downing 4 tablespoons total of Robitussin cough syrup and half a bag of Halls Defence Vitamin C Assorted Citrus cough drops....I think I'm down to like 12 out of the original 30 that were supposed to be in that bag o.o.

Anyhoo, I'm sure some of you are still curious as to what the hell happened to me from Jul. 2006 up to when I started updating again since I came home for my paid holiday.  I appreciate your patience all of you, and promise that an an update will come as soon as I can, hopefully either tonight or at the end of this week.  My other LJ, <lj user=""mc_arctrooper"">, will still be used for assorted commentaries and my non-technical writings hopefully.  I have to contact the <u>Reporter</u> office and see what I can do about getting access to some of the articles I wrote in the 2006-2007 school year at RIT.

With that said, some of you have also been sent e-cards about this.  I couldn't send to everyone, but it is still the same point.

Thanks for the memories in 2007, both the good and bad.

Thanks for being my friend and being there for me when I needed it.

I hope we can continue to be friends and better ones at that next year.

May God bless you and your family and loved ones and that you celebrate the New Year safely and responsibly.

Happy New Year to everyone!

See you in 2008 ^_^ :)"

May you have a safe and Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Boxing Day.

Celebrate your holidays well, safely, and with family.

Be well, and be safe.  

Remember your friends, and those who cannot be there, for they are still with you somehow, in your heart.

Mum, Max, and Minnie may not be with me, but I know they are still here spiritually, celebrating it all with us.

My father and sister are doing well, though I have to take care of them both as they are sick.  I hope I just don't get their illness :P  I'm home in West Chester, PA now, until New Year's Day, flying in from Long Beach, CA -> Phoenix, AZ -> Washington, DC -> Philadelphia, PA.

I hope you all enjoy the rest of your holiday, and before I go, I would like to leave you:

<lj-cut text="" A Different Christmas Poem "">
<b>A Different Chrismas Poem</b>

<i>This was written by a Lt. Cmdr of a US Naval logisitcs unit in Iraq</i>

The embers glowed softly, and in their dim light,
I gazed round the room and I cherished the sight.
My wife was asleep, her head on my chest,
My daughter beside me, angelic in rest.

Outside the snow fell, a blanket of white,
Transforming the yard to a winter delight.
The sparkling lights in the tree I believe,
Completed the magic that was Christmas Eve.

My eyelids were heavy, my breathing was deep,
Secure and surrounded by love I would sleep.
In perfect contentment, or so it would seem,
So I slumbered, perhaps I started to dream.

The sound wasn't loud, and it wasn't too near,
But I opened my eyes when it tickled my ear.
Perhaps just a cough, I didn't quite know,
Then the sure sound of footsteps outside in the snow.

My soul gave a tremble, I struggled to hear,
And I crept to the door just to see who was near.
Standing out in the cold and dark of the night,
A lone figure stood, his face weary and tight.

A soldier, I puzzled, some twenty years old,
Perhaps a Marine, huddled here in the cold.
Alone in the dark, he looked up and smiled,
Standing watch over me, and my wife and my child.

""What are you doing?"" I asked without fear,
""Come in this moment, it's freezing out here!
Put down your pack, brush the snow from your sleeve,
You should be at home on a cold Christmas Eve!""

For barely a moment I saw his eyes shift,
Away from the cold and the snow blown in drifts.
To the window that danced with a warm fire's light
Then he sighed and he said ""It's really all right,

""I'm out here by choice.  I'm here every night.
It's my duty to stand at the front of the line,
That separates you from the darkest of times.
No one had to ask or beg or implore me,
I'm proud to stand here like my fathers before me.
My Gramps died at Pearl on a day in December,""
Then he sighed, ""That's a Christmas 'Gram always remembers.

""My dad stood his watch in the jungles of 'Nam,
And now it is my turn and so, here I am.
I've not seen my own son in more than a while,
But my wife sends me pictures, he's sure got her smile.""

Then he bent and he carefully pulled from his bag,
The red, white, and blue...an American flag.
""I can live through the cold and the being alone,
Away from my family, my house and my home.

""I can stand at my post through the rain and the sleet,
I can sleep in a foxhole with little to eat.
I can carry the weight of killing another,
Or lay down my life with my sister and brother..

""Who stand at the front against any and all,
To ensure for all time that this this flag will not fall.
So go back inside,"" he said, ""harbor no fright,
Your family is waiting and I'll be all right.""

""But isn't there something I can do, at the least,
Give you money,"" I asked, ""or prepare you a feast?
It seems all too little for all that you've done,
For being away from your wife and your son.""

Then his eye welled a tear that held no regret,
""Just tell us you love us, and never forget.
To fight for our rights back home while we're gone,
To stand your own watch, no matter how long.

""For when we come home, either standing or dead,
To know you remember we fought and we bled.
Is payment enough, and with that we will trust,
That we mattered to you as you mattered to us.""</lj-cut>

Please feel free to share the above poem if you wished.  Even if you disagreed with that message, I still will wish you all a safe and Happy Holidays.

Enjoy it well, and thank you all for your friendship and the good times.  You all mean so much to me :)"

It also sucks when most of the public wifi spots here are not free > _ <

It also sucks holy royal balls when public wifi doesn't let you access half the shit you want to because of their firewall.  That includes Outlook and Pidgin.

"event","As some of you may know, yesterday, 16 Apr. 2007, was the <a href = ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre""> Virginia Tech Massacre </a>.  They know identified the shooter as a South Korean native on a US visa, a 4th year English major.

I had a friend who goes there, and she's all right.  I had also another friend, an NSer, who was visiting the campus as he was considering going to that school next year, and his account as he told me:

""<i>For those of you who don't already know, Virginia Tech was struck by the worst mass shooting in US history today. Currently, 33 are dead, along with the gunman. The attack took place mainly in Norris Hall (there was a separate, possibly related attack earlier in the morning that killed 2). Unfortunately, I was in the adjacent Burres Hall (Administration) on a college visit. I, unfortunately, heard the shots, and watched police arrive, surround the building, blow down the doors and storm it. At that time, Burres Hall was locked down and placed under guard due to suspicions that it may be targetted as a center for administration. Fortunately, that was not the case.

At the time, I did not think it was affecting me too greatly, and thought nothing more. However, having heard the death toll since, and finally connecting sounds that I initially thought were construction sounds with really being gunshots, and that most of each shot connected, and that had it been two hours later, I would've been in that very building, I find myself very, very shaken.</i>""

No matter what people say, there's only one person to blame for this.  Not the administration.  Not US firearms law.  Not media.  Not the family of the shooter, but the shooter himself.  He will atone for his actions in the presence of God himself, as He's the only one who can tell his fate.

RIT had a memorial service today, followed by ringing the bell 33 times, for each one lost.

For everyone else, please pray for the families of those lost, for everyone at Virginia Tech, and for all those 32 souls lost.  May God grant them all peace in the afterlife and grant the grieving the strength to get through this, in this dark hour.

VT, RIT, and the US are with you.  Today, we are all Hokies.

"event","This was taken from Danelle on FB:

A farmer had some puppies he needed to sell. He painted a sign advertising
the 4 pups. And set about nailing it to a post on the edge of his yard. As
he was driving the last nail into the post, he felt a tug on his overalls.
He looked down into the eyes of little boy.
""Mister,"" he said, ""I want to buy one of your puppies.""
""Well,"" said the farmer,
as he rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, ""These puppies come from
fine parents and cost a good deal of money.""
The boy dropped his head for a moment.
Then reaching deep into his pocket,
he pulled out a handful of change
and held it up to the farmer.
""I've got thirty-nine cents.
Is that enough to take a look?""
""Sure,"" said the farmer.
And with that he let out a whistle.
""Here, Dolly!"" he called.
Out from the doghouse and down the ramp ran
Dolly followed by four little balls of fur.
The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes
danced with delight.
As the dogs made their way to the fence,
the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the doghouse.
Slowly another little ball appeared, this one noticeably smaller. Down the
ramp it slid. Then in a somewhat awkward manner, the little pup began
hobbling toward the others, doing its best to catch up...
""I want that one,"" the little boy said, pointing to the runt. The farmer
knelt down at the boy's side and said, ""Son, you don't want that puppy. He
will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs would.""
With that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and
began rolling up one leg of his trousers.
In doing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg
attaching itself to a specially made shoe.
Looking back up at the farmer, he said,
""You see sir, I don't run too well myself,
and he will need someone who understands.""
With tears in his eyes, the farmer reached down and picked up the little
pup.
Holding it carefully handed it to the little boy.
""How much?"" asked the little boy. ""No charge,"" answered the farmer,
""There's no charge for love.""
The world is full of people who need someone who understands.
It's National Friendship Week."

"event","We spent the first three nights home with Mike running downstairs before and after every feeding to store pumped breast milk in the fridge, wash pump parts, warm bottles. How did it take us so long to realize there's a sink in the master bath and we could just bring up a cooler to store pumped milk? 

(I'm pumping constantly because my milk took a long time to come in, which combined with jaundice meant a lot of formula supplementing while NICU pediatricians frowned, which eventually caused trouble breastfeeding, which means even more pumping)."

"event","Yet another way that Mike is awesome.  

Me, last night: You know what we should do?  We should replace this stupid closet rod.  
Mike: You're right.  Do you want to do that tomorrow?
Me: We can do that?  

In my head, these things take planning.  Thinking about the plan, and debating the plan.  Research.  Then scheduling the Big Day well in advance.  In Mike's world, if you want to fix something, you just fix it.  We've dealt with the stupid closet set-up for two years, we've got a Saturday free (save for a quick airport run to pick up traveling friends), let's do this thing.  

Every closet in our house has these stupid metal combo shelf-rail thingies.  You can only hang hangers from them by reaching into the hidden back part.  The rod part is just a piece of metal that hangs off the front of the shelf and curves toward the back.  It's annoying, but tolerable in all the closets but our bedroom.  

So today we went to Home Depot, and as I type Mike is drilling new holes in the closet to install more practical shelving.  I'm staying within earshot for when he needs another pair of hands (and I ought to be grading papers, probably I will in a bit).  Emptying the closet and removing the old shelf took just minutes.  By the end of the day we should have a closet much more to our liking."

This has inspired me to actually post in this journal, because I wish to note that I posted here about receiving my current laptop, <a href=""http://hatgrlstargazer.livejournal.com/5370.html"">in 2006</a>.  Sparrowhawk has served me well lo these many years, but like Falkor before him he is now quite ready to retire.  

Yeah, I keep using one laptop forever.  This is why I don't watch many youtube videos.  It's also why I am continuing to buy Thinkpads.  This one still does an acceptable job at the ripe old age of 7.  

New laptop will be a Thinkpad Edge.  It'll be my first widescreen laptop, a trend I long wanted to resist.  I'm a little worried about the ""clickpad"" it has, but I read some reviews that say it's great.  I'm sticking with Windows 7 because I get the impression that Windows 8 is silly.  

But yeah.  New laptop after 7 years.  Will the new one last as long, or will I start updating at a more normal rate? Will LJ still exist when I replace this one?"

"event","I woke up today to the sound of a work crew cutting down trees in the back-patio area of our block (on Saturday!  How strange).  Due to the way sound carries in this complex, it sounds like they are in our patio or the one next door, even though I can no longer see them.  So I keep having to jump up and check if they are cutting down <i>our</i> tree.  

I wouldn't blame them if they wanted to cut down our tree.  It's not precisely supposed to be there.  It is the offspring of a neighboring maple; we get little tiny maples trying to grow in our flowerbeds all the time.  This one was *just big enough* when we moved in that Mike felt bad about ripping it out.  By which I mean perhaps 4 or 5 feet of very slender sapling.  Honestly it's too close to the fence to be allowed to get too large.  But, five years later, it is very tall and reasonable thick around, and Mike and I have an odd affection for the silly thing.  There's a real tree now where there didn't used to be.  

So ever few minutes I run to the window to see if the sounds are coming from as nearby as it seems.  I think they cut down the pretty flowering tree next door whose branches hang over our fence.  I'll miss the flowers next spring."

It was in a ziploc bag, but the water got in anyway and it was thoroughly ruined.  So today, we went to the Verizon store to look at phones (after being unable to draw much conclusion from the web, and because Mike wanted to see if his phone was at all salvageable - sadly they couldn't even get his contacts off it).  

I bought a <a href=""http://www.nokiausa.com/find-products/phones/nokia-7705"">Nokia Twist</a>.  I'm afraid I may regret this.  Mike got a Samsung Reality, which he seems to like so far.

"event","Yesterday Mike got the bike tires inflated and oiled the chains, so we've been riding around the neighborhood.  The bikes have basically been sitting under the tarp since last August, when I started my job.  I've really missed riding to work.  My ankle is still causing me to limp a bit and keeping my walking speed slow, so the freedom of riding is extra sweet.  The bicycling motion doesn't hurt at all.  

We're contemplating getting new bikes.  We are both still riding bikes we got as kids.  My bike is a 10-speed Huffy I got for Christmas when I was not quite as tall as I am now, and I rode it to work nearly every day for six years of grad school.  It's an ancient piece of junk, but it still meets a minimum of functionality so there's no excuse to get rid of it.  Does it make sense to replace it now, when I kept it for all the years it was my primary form of transportation; now that I no longer *need* it does it make sense to upgrade?  Will I ride enough for it to be worthwhile?  Or does my increased paycheck justify the purchase?  Hmm.  

I've already been thinking that I need to find a new apartment in South Bend, one from which I can bike to campus if I want to (or at least *somewhere*, I can't get out of my current complex by bike at all).  Also one with a functional dishwasher.  A trunk-mounted bike rack for the car may also be on the shopping list."

"event","About a week ago, <lj user=""roman_mclaze""> invited Mike and I to a Memorial-Day-weekend barbecue in Dayton.  Even though we did not have a lot of plans for the long weekend, we had to turn down the invite, as the barbecue was on Sunday evening and so was our community band rehearsal.  I explained that it was the last rehearsal before our performance at the Old West End Festival.  I hadn't been able to participate prior to the end of the semester, so I was behind on the music, and Mike has been the only percussionist much of the time.  So it was important that we attend.  

Too much of the band disagreed, it seems.  When we arrived at the rehearsal at 7pm, a dozen or more people were missing, only two of which had informed the band director that they would miss the rehearsal but would still make the concert.  There was much disappointment, but it was agreed that we couldn't be confident that enough people were coming to the concert to cover all the parts.  So, the gig would have to be canceled and we all went home.  

At this point it's important for me to note that, having had a late lunch, Mike and I had not eaten dinner before the rehearsal but instead consumed two large ice cream sundaes.  We were planning on a late dinner.  The resultant sugar high might be largely responsible for what happened next.  

As we walked out of the rehearsal, I commented to Mike that I had half a mind to just drive down to Dayton right now.  Mike told me to call Roman.  He didn't pick up, so I sent him a text.  We went home, checked our email and the weather...  And decided that darn it, we were getting out of Toledo one way or another.  By 8pm, when Roman texted me back, we were on the interstate headed south with an overnight bag, a stack of reading material and our Ohio atlas.  

Because Roman is awesome, he was cool with visitors showing up on his doorstep at 10:30 at night with two hours notice.  He had also put out ""the call"", and as the nearby barbecue wound down a remarkably large number of geeks arrived.  Including <lj user=""kingyoco"">.  A D&D game began around midnight.  One of Roman's friends has put together D&D 4th edition characters for a large selection of Marvel, DC, and TMNT heroes, and is now play-testing them in prep for a larger campaign.  Seven of us picked characters, and he threw us into a battle against villains similarly drawn from three universes.  It took us until about 4am to complete the encounter.  

When we eventually got up the next morning, Roman, Emlin, Mike and I went to a local pancake place for brunch (appropriately enough).  Then Roman took us to the Air Force Museum.  It was cool, and particularly appropriate for Memorial Day.  Rather more walking than I've done since hurting my ankle; I held up okay but not great.  The guys were sympathetic to my slow walking pace.  

We hit the road back to Toledo a little before 5; Roman had family stuff to do and we were in favor of getting home early.  Eventually we found the rain which had been forecast.  It seems it was a good day to be exactly as far south as we were, weather-wise.  

Clearly it had been too long since Mike & I had an adventure.  This was a good one.  Our spontaneous road trips always seem to work out well; really what more could we need than each other, a good map and a credit card?  This time we were very glad to have friends as flexible as we were."

"event","Finally had another appointment with the ortho (at the last one he said ""come back in six weeks"").  That was a remarkable amount of waiting for not a lot of appointment.  Had an x-ray.  Everything seems to have stayed where he put it, so I am now told to put some weight on it.  Up to about 40 pounds, he said, then had me push the foot down on a scale to see what that felt like.  20 pounds felt like nothing, but it took real effort to put 40 pounds on it.  Just pushing wasn't enough, but actually transferring my weight is still scary.  I'll work on it.  In 4 weeks I'm supposed to upgrade to putting my full weight on it.  He'll refer me to a physical therapist ""if I want"".  I said I'll give it a few days and see how I feel.  In general I'd like more concrete guidance but it's quite possible I don't actually need it (and getting to appointments is hard).  I've also got leave to take off the cast boot and wear normal shoes as I feel comfortable, or walk with the boot instead (it's a walking cast but I wasn't previously allowed to use that feature) if I feel safer that way.  I'm wearing a normal shoe now but again I think I'm gonna work my way up to this.  

And while he didn't exactly ok driving, he was blase about it.  Mike and I agreed that we didn't want me to just drive off to South Bend alone (how would I carry my clean laundry into my apartment anyway?), so I'll be car-less this week still.  But we agreed next weekend I'll do some driving with Mike fretting alongside, and then possibly we'll drive out together next Sunday and Mike can take the train home and leave me the car.  If driving feels okay, and if we can finally manage to get my prescription for a handicap placard filled at the DMV.  BMV.  Whatever they call it in Ohio.  

So.  Progress.  In the past week I've been noticing just how much muscle my left leg has lost (and my right leg has clearly gained from all the standing on one foot).  I hope getting things back as they should be won't take as long as waiting on the bones and ligaments has.  Right now it seems that my fear of hurting my ankle exceeds my chances of damaging it further.  So, time to put all that dance training in listening to my body and finding then safely pushing its limits to good use.  (Already put to good use lately: said dance training in balance, specifically standing on one foot.)"

So today I am wearing a green sweater that's a bit too warm for the gorgeous weather, and a necklace which is technically Scottish but looks close enough.

Drove 2.5 hours to South Bend, packed up some things in my apartment including the birds, stopped by my office to drop off some work I had graded which the sub can return to the students and pick up some books I've been wanting, then drove 2.5 hours home again.  We got back around midnight.  I do not think my leg would have been up to this even two days ago, so I am glad to find it is improving.  I still had to ride sideways in the back seat with my leg up on a pillow the whole way (still managed the seatbelt in almost the right spot), and the vibration became more and more irritating, but I survived okay really.

"event","So I decided to adopt two parakeets from the biology department.  I spoke to the relevant professor today, and she took me to see the birds.  They have a ton of them, around 25, in two giant cages.  Then when I was done on campus I went to petco, and spent entirely too much time and money picking out a nice big cage and some food and toys, etc.  

Then when the helpful employee helped me carry the cage out to the car, it wouldn't fit!  It won't fit through the doors!  It comes oh-so-close to fitting in the front passenger door, if it was just an inch shorter or the car seat a smidge lower...  The employee calmly separated the top part of the cage from the base and put it in the car in two pieces, but what he doesn't realize is that I need to be able to transport the birds in the car in that cage, so having it in two pieces doesn't work!  If I can't put the cage in the car with birds in it, how will I get them home from campus?  How will I get them to Toledo when I am home for more than just a weekend?  

So now I have a dilemma: do I spend even more and buy a little cage for transportation (and then have to coax the birds into it when they need to travel, and possibly freak out the bio prof briefly when I show up with it)?  Or do I return the big cage and buy a slightly smaller big cage that will hopefully fit in the car?  How do I determine if a cage will fit through the odd shape of my car door while inside the store?  

I've been trying to use <a href=""http://www.parakeetcare.org/parakeet-cages.php"">this page<a> to find out how big a cage I need.  The one I bought is <a href=""http://www.petco.com/product/104557/PETCO-Tear-Shaped-Parrot-Habitat.aspx"">this one</a>.  The asymmetrical top helps it to *almost* fit through the door, that matches the shape of the door well, but it's just a little too tall anyway.  It might fit if I turned it on its side, but that would be pretty traumatic for birds I think!  Unfortunately I can't find the other cage I am considering on the website, and I've forgotten the exact dimensions.  

Of course I desperately need to be spending this time working on teaching my class instead."

"event","Several people suggested I listen to audio books while driving between Toledo and South Bend, but it was Mike who caused me to actually try it.  He bought me one and put it in the car.  It's the audio book of ""The Year Of Living Biblically"", by A. J. Jacobs, chosen because it was the cheapest one that looked interesting to Mike at Barnes & Noble.  

Last Friday on my drive home I gave it a try.  I planned to just listen to it in the gap between where I can get South Bend radio stations and where I can get Toledo radio stations (because I prefer to sing while I drive), but I ended up listening to all of disk 1.  Partly because it was hard to identify when one chapter was ending before the next one began (I don't want to pause mid-chapter!), but also because it was interesting.  On the way back I listened to most of disk 2.  There are five or six disks, I think?  I plan to listen to more on Friday.  Maybe I should finish disk 2 earlier so that I don't have to change disks while driving.  Or I guess I could pull off to change them, but I don't like stopping.  

It's an interesting book.  You've probably heard of it, it's the one where the author, who starts out agnostic and not knowing a lot about religion (he's of jewish descent, but grew up in a secular household) but curious about giving religion a try, spends a year trying to take every rule in the bible literally.  It's interesting to watch (er, listen to) him learn things about judeochristianity that I already know, and also find and act out obscure, forgotten, or dropped rules I've never heard of.  I particularly like the rule that you should sound a trumpet made from a ram's horn at the start of each month.  I'm tempted to try that, greeting the month with a trumpet blast.  More exciting than saying ""rabbit rabbit"".  I'm also finding interesting his attempt to learn how to pray.  I'm at the point in the book where he's been at it a few months, and he's starting to get the hang of giving thanks but still isn't really comfortable with the other aspects of prayer.  

It did make the drive go fast, but I worry that it's more of a distraction than familiar music is."

"event","Tonight was my last night observing with Ritter.  Mike came and hung out for the first hour or so.  Before I pointed at the first science target, we took a look at the Ring Nebula through the telescope, always one of my favorites.  Then late tonight, after it rose high enough, I pointed the telescope at Neptune.  Even through the one meter, Neptune is just a tine pale blue dot, but it's a dot that I've always wanted to look at but never got around to.  Well, now I have.

"event","Occasionally visitors to the telescope have told me of ways in which the set-up upsets their fear of heights.  None of the aspects of the telescope they point out have ever bothered me.  Of course, aside from a vague distrust of ladders specifically I typically love heights.  The telescopes at Alfred had more directly heights-related features, and I always relished that.  Folding back the staircase in the Olsen to cover the hole with the trap door, then later climbing down the now-too-steep stairs to run an errand while others were still observing.  Fun stuff.  

But there is one particular thing I do in this telescope that makes me irrationally nervous.  The platform can be raised and lowered for ease of reaching the eyepiece.  The platform is large and moves slowly, so this isn't something I usually *feel* so much as watch closely and wait on.  When I am trying to reach a particularly high-up eyepiece, however, I raise the platform while standing on top of the stepstool right next to the telescope.  I do this so that I can tell the moment the eyepiece comes within reach, to save time.  Usually things line up so that I am standing fairly near the railing at the edge of the platform, and being on top of the stepstool puts the railing a little lower than would be comfortable.  Now I'm not <i>actually</i> in any danger of going over the railing if I fell, otherwise I wouldn't do it.  And I'm not in the habit of falling off of things (have I told you about my No-Fall policy?).  But it's not <i>falling</i> that I'm afraid of.  No, while I stand on the stepstool with both hands on the control panel instead of anything sturdy, with the floor below me ever-so-slowly rising, the thing I am viscerally nervous about is <i>being pushed</i>.  

I am in no way afraid that I might have a clumsy moment and fall.  But I am afraid that, in the middle of the night, with two locked doors between me and the outside world, an imaginary attacker will appear out of nowhere to run up and shove me over the railing of the platform.  And the seconds it would take someone to run from the top of the stairs to my location is not long enough for me to react to their approach and get to a more stable position.  Never mind that, if they somehow got through the two locked doors, and knew where to find me in the dark, I'd certainly hear the door to the dome open and the footsteps up the stairs in plenty of time, even with the noisy machinery in the dome.  

If there were real dangers, they could be corrected.  Prevented.  But the impossible, imaginary dangers?  Unavoidable.  Unpreventable.  If a zombie or velociraptor attacks me in the dome, it's certain death, y'know?  Much scarier than reality.  Woah... I just remembered that my Dad told me much the same thing when I was a kid.  Supernatural things are scarier than real dangers because where real threats can be studied and predicted, imaginary things don't have to follow the rules, and that unpredictability is scary."

"event","Things that are happening on June 7th: 
-Mike&I's 6th anniversary (plan to celebrate Saturday)
-Church at 10am
-Church picnic after church
-Community Band concert at the Old West End Festival, noon
-I am flying to California for a conference
-Noel's birthday (he'll be in California for the conference)

The question is, which flight do I take to California?  And do I play in the concert?  
It's a 45min drive to the airport.  

Option 1: Go to church, attend part of church picnic, leave for the airport at 12:45 for a 3:30 flight.  Get to LAX at 5:22pm, join Noel for birthday dinner and fun.

Option 2: Go to church, skip picnic for concert, leave for airport at 1pm, get to airport only 1:45 before flight instead of 2hr, panic on the way.  If it takes longer than expected to get out of Toledo, this could be a bit of an issue.  Get to LAX at 5:22pm, join Noel for birthday dinner and fun.

Option 3: Go to church, skip picnic for concert, relax some afterwords.  Eat some sort of early dinner, take 5:13pm flight.  Get to LAX at 7:04pm, probably hungry.  Catch up to Noel kinda late.  Biggest concern here is managing hunger, which is a big deal for me.  Also I'll be getting to Pasadena later than I want to, particularly if the flight gets delayed.  

Why do all these things have to happen on the same day?  I'd like to do the church picnic *and* the concert.  I must decide before the band rehearsal this Sunday night."

I spend two nights a week alone in the dark.  Eh, it's a living.  

The computer monitor on the platform is out, makes it a lot darker in the dome (that monitors shows the control room computer which controls the telescope).  I suppose the dark is probably a good thing, but it's rather inconvenient.  

I quite like this new Community Access Target.  It's an interesting challenge, and it means I don't have to worry about should I observe a monthly target even though we got it two weeks ago.  I've got a nightly one that takes up huge chunks of time.  

So much for getting work on my thesis done while I'm here.  *sigh*

He starts this week's recap with a full page of trying to decide what song he'd pick for Year You Were Born week if *he* were a contestant, and concludes with ""I hope this doesn't turn out to be one of those recaps where I can't stop bringing up werewolves. We haven't had one of those in awhile.""  

Dude, my left hand has been hurting all night and I don't know why.  Actually my whole left arm, but mostly my hand.  I suspect I just slept on it weird.  But between being left-handed and the coincidental arrangement of observatory equipment, I need to use my left hand really rather a lot while observing, and it's all tired and achy.  

Rock Band has really got me liking the song Everlong lately.  I don't have an mp3 of it, maybe I'll go youtube it.  

Hey, you know what else is on the internet?  Doctor Horrible.  Maybe I'll watch that again during this next exposure.

Attempting to be sane for a moment, Mike and I are leaving for Buffalo for Easter on Friday morning.  I'm really looking forward to this trip.  Even rather a lot more than usual.  On the down side, even though it's April the current forecast for Easter day is low-40s, which means just like last year (when Easter was in March) I'm trying to dig through my closet and put together an outfit that *looks* spring-y and yet is still warm.  Hrmf.  I wish I had time to photograph outfits and poll you all, I'm sure you'd be very helpful.  

There's a lot of other stuff I'd like to write about but honestly at this point my brain has shut off.  I'm a little worried that I'll make some error in the shut-down procedure.  (I'm waiting on the stupid flat lamp right now, it's gotten oddly dim the last few weeks so we've had to increase the exposure times to ""tedious""."

"event","I've been promoting it elsewhere on the web, but haven't mentioned here the <a href=""http://www.100hoursofastronomy.org/"">100 Hours of Astronomy</a> event going on this weekend (note the website seems to have been usurped by the around the world in 80 telescopes webcast, which also sounds cool), part of the <a href=""http://www.astronomy2009.org/"">International Year of Astronomy</a>.  So we've got all stuff going on at the observatory this weekend.  I had a lousy night in the telescope observing Wednesday evening (again, ranted about elsewhere online but not here), but then gave a really good tour last night and had a pretty good although challenging public observing this evening.  I'm on schedule for public observing tomorrow night as well, but said no to doing things on Sunday because I have community band rehearsal.  I like doing all the tours and public observing, though.  

So I got home from public observing around 10 pm.  Mike and I chatted and watched some dumb tv, and were just beginning to think about bed when Mike looked up and noticed a bulge in the ceiling.  Which we quickly determined was caused by a leak in our hot water heater upstairs.  We right away called the complex's 24 hour maintenance emergency line, and the guy came over to deal with it.  He shut off the heater and got all the water cleaned up, which took a good length of time (and by this point it was around midnight).  He told us he'd have to call and get permission for the overtime it would take to replace the heater tomorrow (an effect of the economy), but assuming that went through he'd be back around 10am to replace it.  

Inconveniently, the heater is hidden behind a panel of the bedroom closet.  We had to clear the stuff out of most of one side of it to get the panel open tonight, and we'll have to empty the *entire closet* to make room to replace the heater.  Including the upper shelves, which have to be removed.  We have a lot of stuff in our closet.  And not a lot of other places we could put it.  Mike's clothes are all now hanging on the pull-up bar.  Some are hanging from the shower curtain rod (since we don't have any hot water right now anyway), but we're worried about putting too much weight on it.  So most of my clothes will spend tomorrow lying on the bed.  Probably along with all the other boxes and shoes and things.  I'm just grateful none of the things on the floor of the closet were damp (since that's where I keep the box that holds my wedding gown!).  The dampness was all under the rug.  Quite a lot of water came out of the bulge in the ceiling when the maintenance guy poked a hole in it, but thankfully we caught it soon enough that the whole ceiling didn't collapse.  The guy said that happened in another apartment just last week.  

Of course this would happen on a Friday night when we've got a really busy Saturday planned.  We've got the monthly cleaning day at church at 9am, then at noon I have to give a tour of the observatory (this one for prospective undergrads).  At one we plan to meet a friend for geocaching around campus, maybe stopping back in the observatory to check out the solar observing event between 2 and 3.  And at 6:30 there's the talk which preceeds my next public observing session.  That talk is about the Herschel space telescope, and I'm quite looking forward to it (and hoping I get to listen and don't have to spend the whole thing setting up the telescope).  It won't actually be dark when the talk ends, but I can give a short tour and we can look at the moon.  If people want to stay until it's dark I may try to find another target, but it's kind of an awkward time of year: the Orion nebula is setting and Saturn is rising, both are a little low on the horizon for our particular set-up.  Anyway.  While we're running around doing all this, our heater will hopefully be replaced.  Mike and I agreed that I'd stay home from the cleaning day until they got started with the water heater and it was clear I wasn't needed for anything, then catch up.  

And then Sunday is Palm Sunday, and the first service by our new rector!  We are all very excited about him, and I could say many nice things but it's almost 2 and I need to get up early.  I'm just so wired, between the late nights recently and the plumbing-related excitement tonight.  I should try to go to bed anyway, though.  I'm gonna regret it in the morning."

I have to go home now and take a nap so that I will survive my observing shift.  While I am observing, I will try to come up with a better way to convey the hilarity, but I do not promise I will succeed.  Everything is hilarious once it's late enough at night.  Maybe you should try to keep astronomer's hours and then make your own Occultato jokes.  Then you will see what I'm getting at here."

"event","On Friday, after more than five years, <lj user=""scans_daily""> was suspended for a livejournal terms of service violation.  For those unfamiliar with the site, scans_daily's purpose was to share excerpts from comic books (no more than half an issue, often just one panel) for discussion.  A lot's been said around the internet about it, and I'm going to try to not rehash in my own emotional words what's been said both better and worse elsewhere.  When it comes down to it, I think we knew that it would only take one complaint to LJ to shut us down, but it felt like, after five years and over 8,000 official members (and uncountable lurkers), after posts to the community from actual comic creators, that surely the major publishers were aware of the site.  It's continued existence must therefore have meant they had decided to let it slide.  Of course, I don't think it would have needed to be a major comic company's legal dept that complained for LJ to shut it down.  But anyway.  

It was scans_daily that introduced me to comic books.  I'd always been fond of of superheroes, but I had only watched them in cartoons and movies, never comics.  A handful of Star Wars comics, read in middle or high school out of Star Wars completeness, rather turned me off of the medium, honestly.  It always seemed too expensive a hobby.  And if I did think about it, I wouldn't know where to start.  But then in I think early 2006 I stumbled across scans_daily.  Now here was something different.  Here was something I didn't even know I wanted.  Here was a somewhat female-dominated site that let me dig through and explore what comics actually were like.  Which comics meant something to fans who think like me (or at least make jokes I laugh at), and why?  And what did I need to know before I could understand them?  With a little help from wikipedia, in only a few months I felt like I was up to speed enough on those decades of continuity, at least on the characters that most appealed to me.  And soon, I started wanting to buy specific comics for myself.  I found a comic shop here in Toledo, and walked in relatively undaunted, because I knew what I was looking for.  Before scans_daily, I didn't even know comics would interest me.  

Today I'm purchasing about four ongoing comics a month (that's changing at the moment because of some crazy event stuff in the Bat books).  I've got a rapidly-filling shelf of trade paperbacks and an amazon wishlist a mile long.  I can't speak for anyone else and it's impossible to compile statistics on this sort of thing, but every penny I have spent (and ever will spend) on comic books is because of scans_daily.  

I meant that to be just a few sentences.  Oops.  Anyway, as a bit of a tribute to the community, I wanted to post the funny quotes I have accumulated from scans_daily posters.  Quotes from discussions that are now gone, most of them accompanied by url's that will no longer let you see the comic pages being discussed*.  But hopefully, most of them are funny or otherwise entertaining anyway.  Not really a ""greatest hits"" or anything, just the things I happened across and was moved to save over the past few years.  

*I'm told that a backup of the site was made within the past month, but I haven't attempted to explore it yet and doubt I could ever re-find all these posts.

"event","There are very few observers on the team this semester.  So I've got all night both Wednesday and Thursday, rather than a few half-night shifts.  Today conditions were *finally* good enough to observe again (we've gotten data on only three nights since the start of December, and then not much of it, due to clouds, snow, cold, and ice).  Between not having thought about it ahead of time, and the combination of still-early sunset and colloquium, I didn't even go home for dinner, just stayed here.  Mike brought me dinner in the control room.  

But now the thin clouds have thickened and the humidity rose to the point where I'm closing and going home.  And looking out from the dome, the world seems ethereally beautiful.  The clouds are nearly fog, blurring the view of trees and building just across the street and a small grassy lot.  The city lights reflect off the snow and diffuse through the almost-fog giving everything this soft glow.  Not good for observing, but just magical for staring-at.  

It's much warmer than it has been, we reached freezing today and it's still above 20 F.  But it feels much colder.  Possibly because it's below 65 in the control room (if that thermometer's right), and this shirt isn't thick enough so I'm never quite getting warm.  That does somehow make the night seem more romantic, and the work harder.  

Yeah, I've been here too long, I'm getting strange.  It's bedtime.  Somehow I'm getting my wires crossed between the image of the dedicated astronomer in the icy cold dome on a crystal-clear winter's night, and misty romantic fog imagery.  Fog is *bad* for astronomers."

Other stations in the region are reporting 7 F and 9 F, and those seem more accurate to what I feel.  Need a good outdoor thermometer on campus.  It's 16 in the telescope dome, but that's sheltered and gets some heat from the building (much as we want it to be the same as outside).

"event","Because I know there are those among you who find it as interesting as I do...  

Big snow storm last weekend.  It started Friday, earlier than forecast, and snowed lightly to moderately just about non-stop until Sunday.  The snow was perfect powder, no slushiness at all, so the driving conditions never got worse than ""Level 1 Snow Emergency"" (which seems to translate as ""please drive carefully"").  

I had remote observing to do, so I drove the new car to campus at 2am.  The car drove just beautifully.  No one else on the road and I had no trouble at all.  My advisory, worried that conditions would be worse when we finished work, didn't drive to campus.  She did the remote observing from home.  I was on video conference with the telescope operator in Hawaii, and speakerphone with my advisor at her home.  And we both worked the computers through the internet.  Went well.  Got all of our targets that were high enough above the horizon, and one that was sort of pushing it.  

So then I cleared my car off at 11am to go home.  Snow was still falling.  Traffic was still light for the time of day but not empty.  And really the only thing I had to worry about driving was the other cars, several of which seemed to be on the road only because the driver was nuts.  

Sunday morning, the precipitation apparently changed to ""freezing mist"" and the county declared that we were at a Level 2 Snow Emergency just in time to cancel church.  Seemed a little ridiculous (we stayed at level 1 all that time, and *now* we're at level 2?) but I needed the sleep anyway.  By mid-afternoon, when I went to do some shopping, the roads were clear.  Or at least the main ones, the side roads don't actually get plowed but traction on the beaten-down snow was decent.  

Yesterday the temperature began to drop from high twenties to an overnight low of -6 (as reported by the NWS, I wasn't up watching).  Today we're at 12 F (-11 C), above the forecast high of 11 F.  Wow, I just realized the current mid-day temperature is the telescope's low-temperature operating limit.  Currently we're forecast to get down to a high of <i>6 F</i> on Friday.  I'm grateful I still have my collection of heavy sweaters.  While clearing off the car this morning, I thought: ""Down side of driving - must clean off car, and hunt for parking space (plus the expensive parking pass ordeal mentioned Monday).  Up side - don't have to walk a mile in single-digit temps.  Car wins.  This week, at least.""  

I know several of you have mentioned this cold snap being forecast both west and east of here, too.  Stay warm, everybody."

And I had to stand in line for an hour to get the tag (I should have gone on Friday, but the snow encouraged me to put it off; I planned to do it on Sunday but didn't realize how early the office closed).  Grad students have faculty parking privileges, but the tag says student.  I'm assured than when they enter the number to give me a ticket for being in the wrong lot, a message will pop up saying I'm allowed to be there.  This sounds like a really stupid system likely to have errors.  Apparently it's a feature of the new software; because it says we're students the staff isn't allowed to just hand us the faculty tag anymore even though we're allowed to park in the faculty lots.  Not that I'm parked in the faculty lot right now; it's full.

In fact I found it to be *hilariously* bad.  I enjoyed the badness quite a bit (maybe this is why people buy All-Star Batman?).  Mike I do not think had as much fun.

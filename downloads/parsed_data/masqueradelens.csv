How do you do? I'm very much in love with you. I met you a couple of months ago and now I see you every single day, you're gorgeous. 

My classes are going well, and I had my first singing lesson last week. I sound terrible but, apparently, I have the ability to become a soprano if I pratise and practise. Kate, my teacher, is really cool and easy going. :) Last night I finished the matching beanies for the soon-to-be-born twins. They'll look lovely with the hug-me-tights and booties. Sharon, my flat mate, thinks they're cool. I'm swelling with pride.

Gotta go, but I'll come and talk to you again - I promise,



Love, love, love,

Masq. x"

I have moved out of home, I have been out for three weeks. I abosolutely love my freedom. No longer am I subjected to my family's disapproval and harsh words. They cannot control me how they are accustomed to doing.


ii.

Ending my exclusive relationship with my (now) ex was the right course of action to take. He's now my best friend - my very best friend.


iii.

I feel a lot happier.

I've joined some clubs. :)


Thank you to those of you who kept on reading my journal whilst I almost worried myself to death. Don't you  just love life?

"event","<center>Well, I went and inspected the house.</center>

At first, I couldn't get inside. I tried the locks with each key on the real estate's key ring. I wiggled the door and nothing happened. Not one damn key would turn. So, after fifteen minutes of trying (I'd been waiting for the keys for almost a week), I called the real estate's office. No-one could come out and help me, not even for five minutes! I called my boyfriend, he couldn't come to my aid either. But, being the determined young woman that I am, I tried again and I cursed - a lot. Grumbling, I shoved the jangling keys back into my pocket and hiked my way back to the office. I power walked and planned - oh, yes, I planned - what I was going to say to them about their dogdy service! 

I walked up to the counter, face red and breathing heavily as perspration formed and collected on my brow. The receptionist looked at me, and her eyes widened. My heart wasn't in it. I didn't yell, or scream, after all, this was a nice lady who'd served me on many occassions previously. She apologised that no-one could help me, and she talked to all of the other receptionists to see if they knew any information about the difficult lock. No-one knew. She tried hard. One of them looked at me with her giant hazel brown eyes and suggested that I climb the back fence and try the back door. I wasn't sure but they encouraged me to ask one of the neighbours to let me into their back yard so that I could climb the fence. Ok. Keys in hand for another hour, I marched back to the unit.

Red palms, sore fingers and fifteen to twenty minutes later I was still in the same position as I was forty minutes ago. None of the neighbours were home, I'd knocked. Frustrated, I sat on the asphalt drive and flicked through my papers wondering whether or not I should just give up and go home. Call it a day and accept my fate. And, then, it dawned on me.... Did I have the correct house? I flicked through the brochure, that I'd been carrying, and gazed at the picture. Yep, it looks just the same. I shut the slim, blue book in frustration. Then, I open it again. I carefully inspected the black and white picture and compared it with the front of the units all sitting in a neat little row. Yes, it's just the same...but, hang on, what's that driveway, there, next door? There's no driveway, here....

Ten minutes later, I was sliding a key into a door with one lock and stepping into a unit. *coughs* Five minutes later, my boyfriend and I were chatting to each other via mobiles and giggling over my mistake. I'd been trying to unlock the door to someone elses house for, all up, a good thrity minutes. I was just extremely thankful that I hadn't scaled their back fence in an attempt to find a way in. *blushing* I could just imagine how embarrassing the situation could have been if some police officers had shown up, ""Ooohhh! So, this isn't the correct house!? I knew that, officer."" or ""I was just checking the window seals and the fence's wooden slats, I'll be on my way now."" [insert self blushing profusely]

The next door neighbours, of the correct house, were nice middle aged security guards who all came out and greeted me. Now, I'm just waiting for the property manager to call me back today or on Monday to inform me of whether or not my application for the unit was successful. 

But I will tell you, just on a side note, that upon entering the unit my first thought, as my gaze leisurely embraced the inner decor, was ""Ah, this smacks of reality."" When I told my parents my mother laughed and said that now I'd see how the other ""half"" live. Thanks mum.

All in all, I hope that I have provided you with at least a little amusing entertainment as I did my family and friends. *sighs*

I don't know what it is about constantly changing hair stylists, trying new people and places. Well, actually, I do know; I find it thrilling to meet someone new. I like to chat to a total stranger who's pleasent and has no desire to form an attachment, such as, frienship.

I love the different surrounds, that new salons provide. There're always new things to look at, new objects to spy. Husky toned lights, with their exotic shadows of varying shades of grey, come to mind as well as the scented hair-care products mingled with the bitter smells of a beatician's work room.

Tonight, the moon is bright. It's white like a polished pearl hanging against a black, indigo sky. As the night's cold wind caressed the exposed skin of my throat, I found myself wondering if each of the universe's stars were really distant memories that had escaped from our minds during slumbering dreams? Some stars are brighter than others, a fact which I attributed to them having been thought of in a more fondlier context by their creators. But, as the night's vast emptiness echoed with life,  I found myself curling into a ball upon the lawn's chilled blades of grass and pondering the fate of the stars that are dead. Are they forgotten memories like one's first romantic kiss, the wrinkles in an aged lover's face, or the warbling of dawn's birds? I plucked a small flower from its leaf-enshrouded stem and realised that none of this made sense to me. I understood it all as much as I did my sleeping flower with all of its petals tightly pressed together like a banana peel.

Your contenance and sleazy leer impressed us even more, as we sat behind you in my mum's car sniggering like two year olds. A noise of great delight escaped him, my friend that is, and he eagerly pointed out the source of his immediate amusement - you and your car. For, plasted to the rear door was a sticker whose purpose was to give some insight to its owner's temperament; and, yes, how we did laugh at yours. For stuck to the glass, melting under the midday's hot sun, was a statement conveying your animal magnatism: ""Irresistable Bitch!"". We wondered at your age (63? 65? 67?) before, once more, turning our attention back to the map but, now, with slightly amused expressions."

I'm sucking warm tea through a Nice biscuit. mmm!

Today, whilst I was driving along the highway in my old, rusty car, I flicked on my windscreen wipers and I just happened to catch a glimpse of some smallish object flicker past my range of vision. Puzzled, I checked out my wipers at the first available opportunity. There, on the rubber, was a furry catapillar clinging for all it was worth. I pulled over, in the pouring rain (skirt billowing, hair soggying up), and I gently extricated him from my car and put him safely on the lush green grass blades by the side of the road. Damn, I'm such a sucker for nature. :/

I dunno.

""You love girly things like expensive shoes, dresses and those bottles of perfume you keep on your dresser top...but you never bother with your make-up or hair. I'm not saying that you ought to, but it just seems sort of odd.""

The cat left a pair of tiny mouse feet on the back door step, this morning, there's also some minature intestines and a stomach in perfect condition. Not a scratch or a tooth mark. She must have been hungry. Usually we receive the hind quarters and the head, with their raw rodent smells, which makes me shudder and feel peekish.

I know that I should probably feel embarrassed, but I don't. It's quite nice - the feeling of voluptuousness. I used to stare at my jutting hip bones, small, curved and sharp,  and imagine a dairy cow's bony hind quarters. Now, only my tummy protrudes into the space between my hips; the same hips which stood like pointed sentries guarding my hidden womb.</center>

ii. <center>It was hot, today, too hot. The sunshine had not only warmed the soil and air, but also my body, too. Occassionally, I would feel the wetness of a dewy, sheen of sweat slightly cooled by a rushing of air which I'd caused to come about when moving my limbs, a little. My polo necked tee clung to my moist skin and the dampness of my breasts. Every now and then, I tugged at the collar's small lapels in a vain attempt to find some better comfort. I intiated a wrestling match between myself and my boy friend. My hand was thumping the thickly carpeted flooring, counting him out, when he lurched forward and tossed me over onto my back; pinning my shoulders to the soft piling. The ovals of my armpits were damp patches of sweat, and my breathing more like heavy, short pants by the time he'd lowered his face to mine and looked into the clear greeness of my eyes; acertaining whether or not I'd given up. I could smell his skin, and it was a beautiful moment, as his dark brown eyes gazed at me.</center>

"event","I heard you breathing, last night, your heart was heavy and slow inside of your chest. As I lent my head against the curve of your rib bones, upon my cheek I could feel the soft, warm smoothness of your skin. Your tender breathing gently ruffled the tiny silken hairs at the nape of my neck, and snores rumbled in and out of your nose. My motor-boat. The dull moonlight, streaming in through a parting in the curtains' fabric, caught and held your face's shapley features; illuminating each and everyone as though they belonged to an ancient Greek sculpture designed by Michaelangelo, himself. My eyesight traced the clean sharpness of your jaw-line, and the set of your chin. So very handsome, so very masculin. Already a growth of dark, spikey stubble has grown through your skin and your arms are holding me so securely. I love you.

"event","My finger tips are smudged with the colour of disgrace, and I'm finding it hard to feel that way. You're so complex, so terribly complex, I don't understand you. What is it about the undefinable moments that I can't seem to seperate into neat little squares of regular emotions? I'd catergorise them, you know, and then I'd line each up group into a logical and interesting order of jumbled confusions."

Last Friday evening, Honey's soothing touch massaged away my study aches. I almost fell asleep as her delicate finger tips gently rubbed oil over my skin and proceeded to work out my body's knotted muscles. My eyelids were heavy and the relaxation music tickled my ear drums. When I was putting my clothes back on, I looked up into the mirror on the wall and noted how smudged my mascara had become.

Monday consisted of a very busy schedule. I had to rush around endless lines of department stores in search of breast cups, black, and some panty hose. In a moment of weakness, I also purchased a pair which are black with many butterflies permanently suspended in mid-flight upon their silken threads. They're lovely, I plan to wear them often - that is, when I'm not indulging in the feel of my fishnet stockings.

I wore three red roses in my hair, their lovely perfumed scent was divine and they lent the perfect floral aroma to my perfume.  I think a few of the young adolescent males, at the party, developed a crush on me. Ah, youth. Heh!

The music was mediocre, the snacks were scrumptious and the wine was a full-bodied delight! I also learnt that when one is wearing two-inch high stillettos, one must be careful to walk backwards up very steep slopes or risk a potential, social embarrassment. I just wanted to say hello to the ducks and their children, they were so feathery and cute.

iii.

My puppy is stretched out and alseep by my feet. She's enjoying the heater's warm air. I'm wondering what the future holds for me. Tomorrow, I will complete my last exam. On Saturday my better half and I will probably be having a ""talk"". I hope that it's as sweet as the gooey chocolate bar I consumed this evening. Ho-hum, that's life, I suppose."

"event","I held an old fashioned telescope up to my eye, and I looked out over the sea. The waves kept crashing upon slimy, sharp rocks and in dismay I realised that there were no answers to be found for my eternally unasked questions.

Sometimes I believe in dismal bliss, and sometimes I store my faith in aluminium, paper cups. No drips lending rhythm to my echoing heart beats - a bass drum in the gloom. 

Such saucy behaviour is but a ragged mismatch against charatability, I fight against the gloom.

You call me angel, my wings flutter as though they're clipped. Sooty white lengths and tattered ends.

When you say that you love me, my heart says so, too."

Each loving kiss, that you bestow upon my lips, is a red rose in bloom. Its crimson petals are stretched out, and unfolding.

Be calm my wild heart, be quiet. Whisper into the darkness, whisper."

It looks like a blurred edge to me, fuzzy and indistinct.

My friend has fallen upon hard times, I miss her.

Tomorrow it begins and I wonder if I am prepared."

"event","You walked into the party

Like you were walking onto a yacht.

Your hat stragetically dipped below one eye

Your scarf... it was apricot.

You had one eye in the mirror

As you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner

They'd be your partner, and...

You're so vain...

You probably think this song is about you


Dont't you... don't you?


Oh, you had me several years ago

When I was still quite naive

When you said that we made such a pretty pair

And that you would never leave

But you gave away the things you loved

And one of them was me

I had some dreams...

They were clouds in my coffee...

Clouds in my coffee and...


You're so vain...

You probably think this song is about you...

You're so vain...

I'll bet you think this song is about you

Don't you... Don't you?

I'll bet you think this song is about you

Don't you... Don't you?


Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga 

And your horse naturally won

Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia

To see the total eclipse of the sun.


Well, You're where you should be all of the time

And when you're not you're with some underworld spy

Or the wife of a close friend...

Wife of a close friend, and...


You're so vain...

You probably think this song is about you...


You're so vain...

I'll bet you think this song is about you

"event","Today there was no inspiration. I felt devoid of life without my constant companion. It helps me to travel through the hours of the day. One by one as the clock slowly tick-tocks around its circular face, my eyes' gaze following the steady movement of the thin black metal arms. Tick, tock.

Last night, I again dreamed that I was pulling out tufts of my silky, soft hair in the most curious manner imaginable...this time it involved a magpie and a few black, orange, green and white coloured ladybirds. I watched the shiny blonde tufts float to the ground, the hot autumn sunshine glinting off each strand. I was surrounded by a pool of long blonde hair, my hair. I thought perhaps my recent choice of reading material had contributed to my odd dreams, but then I remembered my other dream, of a simliar context, from a few nights before last.



Today I admire Nancy Friday."

"event","When the orange flame flickered it drew my attention to the state of the charred wick, which was slowly crumbling beneath such intense heat; like a bony old finger it curled into a black, crooked shrivel. 

Tonight, after tucking my boyfriend into bed and bidding him goodnight, I stood on the back veranda and breathed in the night's cool air. For some strange reason I was captivated by the shadows stretching out across the lawn and I greedily drank in the black silence of the night. There was enough moonlight - thrown down from the sky above - for me to see clear across the back yard, right up to where the none existent gate sits...swinging back and forth, every now and then admitting tiny, grating metalic squeaks, as the hinges work in the wind.

Is so much contemplation and the indulgence of self reflection healthy in one so young?

Today, I admire Lyn."

"event","When God began creating the
heavens and the earth, the earth
was at first a shapeless, chaotic
mass, with the Spirit of God brood-
ing over the dark vapours.
  Then God said, ""Let there be
light."" And light appeared. And
God was pleased with it, and divided
the light from the darkness. So he let
it shine for a while, and then there
was darkness again. He called the
light ""daytime"", and the darkness
""night time"". Together they formed
the first day.

  I was running my fingers along my mother's smooth, pine bookshelves and, to my surprise, the wood was strangely cool beneath my finger tips as I gently glided them along the polished tops. I found an assortment of odds and ends, and, of course, reading material. Here are some of the items I've found at rest upon the shelves: translation dictionaries;  maps, of places unknown to me; records; photo albumns; something called a ""Quick Splice"" which guarentees its level of quality and competency with ""Automatic Butt-Splicer"" typed in bold, scarey letters; my deceased Grandfather's porthole clock; a Bible; innumerable sets of Scrabble (and other board games), and an extremely large novel collection. 

  I have a pounding headache, if its ferocity worsens my skull might crack...that sha'n't be helpful. :(

  I also found a giant sized magnifying glass with a light. I think it belonged to my nanny. The small wrinkly people have some pretty snazzy gadgets. I wonder if any of them are used when engaging in sexual activity...?

  I filed my nails down into round-ended squares and painted them to look like acrylics. I dearly miss how they used to look - beautifully oval; however, I know that no matter how much I mourn their change of appearance I shall make this exact same mistake again...someday."

"event","work drama:  The guy that was supposedly more qualified for a job than me, is leaving.  Okay that more than me part sounded egotisical....but I didn't mean it that way.  I guess I just have to go about training another TBA person who is more qualified than me.  But I was actually smart this time and am not going to put myself through the dissapointing interview process again.  Phone girl, after spending about 2 weeks of actually working after getting in trouble is back to her usual routine of doing nothing.  I was starting to get worried that something was wrong with her.  Sidenote:  it's payday, which means I can put that money directly into gas for my car.  

life drama:  my little birdies have left the nest today.  Earlier this month a mamma bird had settled into a bush and had three little eggs. About two weeks later the little eggs hatched, yesterday one ventured out on her own, today the other two followed suit.  I never got a chance to name them, I should have.  In other news, I said adios to him...I dunno it just wasn't there. I do consider it odd because I'm usually the dumpee not the dumper.  I guess I'm finally realizing that I shouldn't just feel the need to settle because some unknown part of my subconsious has been conditioned that I have to.  

internet drama:  none really to speak of....other than watching someone OD on the blue crack in his journal.  It was over the dumbest of things too...at first it was amusing to watch in that lookie loo train wreak kind of way, then it just got too painful and revolting.  By the time the plug was pulled on it, he managed to alienate everyone who loved him there.  Really a shame."

not really much to say I suppose.  work sucks...but at least the new boss, who was supposedly more qualified than me is actually learning his job.  The girl who spends her day either on break or talking to her boyfriend on the phone, finally got called out on it.  She had the nerve to be pissed off about said calling out.  I had to fight really hard to keep my mouth shut.  

This is the first time in about three weeks that I haven't felt like my head was full of snot.  This will probably last until late august when the molds come out."

these past few weeks have been utter hell and chaos and stress and all sorts of other uncomfortable things.

"event","So the rumor is that Britney Spears is gonna have a baby.  I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  I remember seeing in an interview that she wanted children to make her life seem ""normal.""  That is probably the most selfish reason in the world to bring a child into this world. Sure she has the money to care for a child, but if she feels her life is somehow out of control and the only way to fix it is to have a kid, that is truely screwed up.  But then again, what do I know, maybe it will be a good thing for her.  I feel sorry for the kid, who will most likely be used as a photoshoot prop instead of being a member of her family.

In other news. The new bossman is doing okay, he's getting some confidence and not letting the younger girls walk all over him like they did originally.  For example one girl took an hour and a half lunch and a 45 minute coffee break last week.  all because she felt she could get away with it because her and bossman are drinking buddies outside of work.  I guess someone *cough*me*cough* put a bug in his ear to be a little more ""bosslike"" and a little less ""barfly"" with some of his employees."

"event","A while back I was babbling about some promotion interview I had.  I didn't end up getting the spot, and they gave it to someone from outside, who as they claimed, was more knowledgable than I was.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Well this new guy, he's a good guy don't get me wrong, but I have to tell him how to do everything.  I dunno, training someone to be your supervisor is kinda weird.  I'm trying to look on the bright side of things and reason out why he was picked (they wanted ""fresh blood"", he can handle the job better....), but something just feels weird inside.  I'm trying to have patience, I really am, but at the same time, I am baffled that they got someone who is really kinda clueless to do the job.  The job I had been doing to one degree or another, just didn't have the official title.  I suppose I could just take it as a sign to kick back and not care about the stuff that he should be doing.  But that is not in my nature, as much as I hurt that I was picked, I hate to see people fail.  As much as part of me wants to say screw it and let him stumble while learning the job, I can't be so petty and selfish and not want to help him out and train him.  Maybe once things settle down and get organized, it'll be okay, and I'll see the wisdom in the choice the higher ups made...but right now I'm having a hard time believing that everything happens for a reason."

"event","Spring, that wonderful time of year when the snow starts to melt, the birds return with their chipper songs, the air is filled with the fresh scent of newly blooming flora.  However, there is a dark side, a hideous evil that lurks about every springtime.  It's worse than allergies, it more insipid than young teens making kissy faces at each other, it's more devasting than seeing ski resorts and snowmobile trails close.  This evil is none other than Girl Scout Cookies, it seems so harmless and pure on the outside, but what lurks beneath is worse than any horror movie.  Yes, don't be fooled by those cheerful green uniforms and the wild eyes of youth, these girls are sent forth on earth by satan to torment us all.  First they come with those colorful order forms, with their wares proudly posted, baiting you to buy just one box.  They know that it's hard to resist an angelic faced 8 year old who wants to go on a camping trip.  Now these campaigns have been extended to the mothers.  In any workplace lounge, one of these orders forms materialize, stuck to the fridge where you are keeping your low cal, low carb, low fat lunch. Try as you might to ignore it, you spend the rest of the day with thoughts of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, and worst of all, the crack in cookie form of Caramel Delites (or Samoas).  All day thinking about that order form, how it's for a good cause, how one little box will be okay and not really cheating on that diet.  Rationalizing and Justifying your weakness for this evil, you reluctantly order a box, or two, or three.  Then suddenly, one day the order form disappears, and the temptation disappears, life almost goes back to normal.  Almost.  A few months later, a familiar knock on the door, those little devil minions are back, they've come to collect, and collect they shall.  Because not only have they taken some of your money, but every year they take a little bit of your soul in exchange for a cookie binge.  These things are pure evil. If I was a conspiracy theorist I would say that these little girls are bent on world domination, and would be damn good at it too with these cookies.  I would call for a x-files type investigation into these girls, but then they might not come to my door next year."

Nothing like being a U2 fan eh? I feel so special, so full of warm fuzzy goodness. Come with me, and we'll share the love together: 

Yes, Yes, it seems like only yesterday when we were presented with the knowledge that itunes would make available to us a prestigous ""Complete U2"" digital box set. We waited patiently, for unreleased tracks and special bonuses, a certain must have for any collector. Finally, the day was upon us, as we booted up our computers, and clicked that oh so familiar icon on the desktop. Except for the people who lived outside the US and a few other countries, they couldn't get itunes. Well, whose fault was it that they lived in a itunes devoid environment, certianly not mine. So those of us forunate (read; living in the US with high speed internet access and extra money to burn) could partake in the glory that is the digital boxset. However, I think am a truely special and unique fan, who happens to have all their major releases, but only wanted the special tracks. When I scrolled through the treasures (what ever happened to Pete the Chop), what was lacking from my personal collection I could only buy if I bought the whole set. Yes, 446 songs, some songs must be so good you need extra copies of them on your hard drive. I know I would feel incomplete without three identical versions of Beautiful Day (oh wait make that 4, since it was already on my computer).  All of this, all of this can be yours, hehe, you know the rest. So I was faced with a dilemma, do I shell out $150, and wait for a 4 plus hour download to get 15 or so songs to have the Complete U2? I made the heartbreaking decision to use that $150 on my heat/electric/internet bills instead. I hope you don't think I'm a bad fan because of that decision, but I digress. 

Then we learn that U2.com really loves us, because they are offering us a chance to buy concert tickets before they go on sale to the general public. What a fantastic idea! The band truely loves us, now I don't have to fight with some kid who is the same age as the Joshua Tree (the album, not the actual tree, because it's dead) for a ticket. Oh, but wait, in order to be part of the special group, you have to pay to be enrolled in the super secret U2 fan club. Surely a super secret group that scalpers and booking agents wouldn't know about, right, right? Well again, I was faced with another monetary dilemma, pay $40 to get a chance for good seats (not to mention a super groovy keychain and links to old video streams), or pay the oil bill. Old man Winter, the bastard, won out; however, I still kept my hopes up high. Perhaps when they announce the tour dates I'll have time to become a member of that super secret group of 100,000 paying subscribers. 

Alas the time of the tour announcement finally came. Apparently, Americans only live in NYC, Boston, Chicago and San Diego (that's a little known fact for you geography buffs). So again, here I am with yet another dilemma, pay for tickets, a hotel and possible airfare; or new tires on my car, my car insurance and the water bill. Please, try not to be further disappointed in me than you already are. So here I was, a simple observer as those more fortunate than I went to buy tickets. Needless to say, I think those were tears of joy on the faces of those fans as they watched U2.com and ticketmaster demonstrate what happens when you don't dismantle that atomic bomb. It's a good things scalpers didn't know about the super secret U2 fan club; because they would charge all out, ripping off the fans, and we all know U2 loves us too much to do that to us. 

Wouldn't you agree?"

"event","In a good way.  See we have this policy that you can't return cameras after 30 days, if it breaks after that time, you have to contact the manufacturer.  So it never fails that we get people who come in after the time period to say that their camera broke on them.  Too bad, so sad, they have to deal with crappy tech support.  Like yesterday, had this girl in who all of a sudden out of nowhere her camera started taking fuzzy pictures. Of course she's been out of town, and unable to bring it back, since it's past the 30 days.  So I open the box and go to test it and low and behold the battery hatch is broken off.  It takes quite a bit of force for those things to snap off, but I get it to turn on and it does indeed take blurry photos.  So I asked if it had been accidently dropped, because the battery cover was broken, which may have caused the camera to not work right.  Oh No! Never! the cover was just fine, and managed to somehow magically break when it got into the store.  I told her that with it being past the 30 days the only person that could approve it would be my boss, who won't be in until Monday.  I know right now that she will say ""yeah right!"" and tell the customer to contact the manufacturer.  See in the past with other bosses, they'd cave to a customer hissyfit, and we'd get stuck with the loss.  Because if a camera, or anything else for that matter, the warranty is void if a malfunction is caused by intentional or unintentional misuse.  But my boss is awesome and doesn't cave for nothing, especially a sorta scam like that, because they knew they broke it themselves.  The lesson here is to take better care of your shit and it won't get broken."

She will usually put up little signs at the time clock, announcements and such, when the next jean day is, when they are cleaning out the fridges, that sort of thing, and every single fucking time, there is a gooddamn typo.  Not just any old typo, but blatant misspellings that a spell check would have caught and fixed before she even noticed it.  So today, there was a posting that next Friday was going to be jean day, but to bring in toiletries to be sent to the Red Cross for <b>TSUHAMI</b> victims.  So I took my ever present sharpie and fixed that right quick.  I don't even know why it bothers me so much, I guess because it is so recurring.  Granted my spelling and grammar aren't that great, but if it's something that's getting posted for everyone I know to see, I at least make an attempt to proofread it. 

Some of the other butcherings I that find humorous:

Personnel and Personal are two different things.  You are part of the Personnel staff halfwit, personal is something that is yours.

Wondering and Wandering are also very different.  Wondering while working is sometimes not a bad thing, at least they are using their brains.  Wandering while working is often frowned upon, because they aren't actually working.

Q:  Why does J-Lo play every character in her new video?

     a) She wants casting directors to see her ""versatility"" in acting and cast her in more movies.
     b) She is such the Diva that she can't bear to be on a set with the members of the Music Video Actors Guild.  
     c)  She's part of that wacky group that clones people, and she has created an army of J-Lo's in an attempt to take over the world.

Some nice customer found it and handed it in, the sad part was, I didn't even know it was missing until I got that message.  I did, because part of me is untrustworthy, call my card company to see if any charges were made yesterday.  Because, hey, you never know, I dropped the card around 7 am, and the message was dated around 4 pm... luckily there were no charges made, it prolley sat in the snow and just not seen all day.  I can think of a zillion worse places I could have lost it, and am happy that the person to find it was good enough to return it.  I think a lot of times you hear so many stories of identity theft and the like that you forget that those criminals truely are in the minority.  That 85% of people (yes I made the number up, because I can) are going to do what that nice person did, return the card and wouldn't even consider doing anything else.

So they postpone the start of the tour for a family illness, and people are pissed.  Get the fuck over yourselves, boo fucking hoo, you have to wait until fall to see them, the nerve of them needing to be with loved ones instead of your whiny ass. 

Some actual quotes collected from the internet(s):

""I wonder why U2.com hasn't reported this! And do you guys know whats else...I'm getting married on September 17th! I really don't want to miss this the Toronto show!I was counting on seeing the show in March, oh man oh man!""

""This is very embarassing for U2. How could they not be ready?! It will be hard to convince me otherwise. ""
""AhhhHHHhhhHhHhuawkawguiHhHhHhHhHhhhhHHHHH!!!

Of course OF COURSE I thought it was too good to be true that U2 would start their tour in my home town. OMG - OMGOMG, I am so depressed. Why are they skipping Miami? It's not fair. Miami is a good town! A nice, big, populated, happenin' town. I have been waiting my whole life to see them and now I am robbed of the ultimate U2 experience. I have never been to a U2 concert. This REALLY bites.""


These are the same people who whined that the band had gotten greedy with the ipod thing.  Pot meet Kettle.  

Thankfully these ungrateful, spineless, pissants are seemingly in the minority.

Work rant:  Part of my job is to sell cameras, unfortunately, the best and most popular models are sold out.  So I have to talk up the mediocre and crappy models.  Which makes me feel kinda shitty, mainly because when someone asks me ""How are the vivitars?"" and that's all we have, I have to be creative and say something like ""It's a great starter camera for those learning digital photography.""  Which I guess is half true, it's good for learning how digitals work in terms of functions, but don't plan on printing any of your photos.  Also don't plan on it working after the 60 day warranty.  Hello, 60 days should tell you something.  Then there are the people who see the $20 digital pieces of crapola, buy it because it's cheap, and then return it the day after christmas because it takes bad quality shots.  *bang head*  Finally, you have the people who can spend a good chunk of money on a camera, but haven't the first clue on how digital cameras work, and will buy anything.  Research people!!!! If you're gonna drop 200-300 on a piece of electronics at least know what you are buying.  and no, just because there is a mpeg function doesn't mean it will be as good as a camcorder.  Same goes with the camcorder that take still shots.  If you want to take movies, buy a fucking camcorder, if you want to take still shots, buy a fucking camera, but don't complain to me when the mpegs on your fuji A3100 are low quality, or when those still shots you took on your JVC U200 are dim because there is no flash on those cameras."

I immediately perk up because it is one of the best songs ever recorded, only to be dismayed when I saw it was being used in a car ad.  A fucking car commercial, not even a good car, a friggin Buick.  Who let this happen, why oh why is one of the true modern classics (by modern I mean in the last 30 years), being used to sell a fucking car.  Then get this, there is an ad for a stupid shitty digital camera with Steven Tyler in it. And yes, these cameras are shit, don't ever buy a sony camera.  Okay his foray into acting was good with Wayne's World, because that made sense, but sauntering into a cafe so actresses who in real life probably have no clue who you are can use their Sony craptasticshot camera to get a picture of you.  Is he back on the smack?  Because I can't think of any decent reason why he'd a.) be in an ad, and b.) why their best song is being used to sell a granny car.  What's next ""Janie's got a Gun"" for a supersoaker, or how about ""Permanent Vacation"" for Carnival Cruises, Heck while were at it, ""Walk this Way"" would be a great pitch for the Scooter Store.

The Good:  
  ipod, I can't say enough wonderful things about this piece of technology.  
  Franz Ferdinand, if there was ever a reason to not use my ipod it's this.  And no, I haven't gotten the album, I should, maybe after my christmas bills are paid off.
  Lost, Dominic Moynihan (sp?)  love love love.  Sawyer lust.  
  Altoids Gum, like chewing on a mouthful of regular altoids, the masocist in me loves the burn.
  Tivo, like the ipod, but for the tv.  
  Kodak Easy Share DX7590, even more of a reason to pester my pets.  
  New U2, finally it's about time, but this is cross referenced in ""the ugly"" category.
  My new job, yay for me, no more having to listen to the Queen ""B"" and her superiority.  
  Learning to Sew, I made curtains, I feel so empowered.
  Orange Mountain Dew, I think this was last years invention, but it still holds up as the best non alcoholic drink eva.
  White Chocolate Reeses cups, again a peanut buttery chocolate goodness party in my mouth
  Guilty verdict for Peterson, may he live a long life in prison with what he did.  
   Bath and Body Works Peony, this was originally just a summer thing, but yesterday it became part of their permanent collection
   New REM, YAY Stipe is my hero, but it makes me sad that Around the Sun didn't get the attention it deserved.
  My cousin for having the courage to come out to the redneck, homophobic side of his family.  
  Kohl's Department Store coming to the area.  I have to ration my visits to that place, or else I'd be deeper in debt.

The Bad:
  American Idol, what a complete mockery and insult to all that is music.  
  ""The Edge posts here"" 
  Avril Lavinge or however the fuck it's spelled.  
  Grape Mountain Dew, blech, stick with Orange.
  Donna, Emily, Dan, Sarah, and all the others that were taken this dark and rainy summer. Miss you.
  Britney can marry a guy for two days, and it's okay, but a long term couple can't because it's a violation of family values.
  Missing my people from my old job, minus the Queen B, The Psycho Hypocondriac, The Screeching Harpie, and the TMI lady.
  Having to spend my bonus on car maintence, if only brakes weren't a necessity ;)
  Emimen, yeah we get it already, you hate everyone, time to move on

The Ugly:
  The complete U2, um yeah cross referenced with good, because it's a good idea, but I'm not paying $150 for 12 songs I don't have already.  Almost makes me lose a bit of faith in something I've loved for so long. 
  Paris Hilton, need I say more.
  Michael Jackson, I have nothing to say other than I hope the people who need help get it.

"event","That is my official verdict of HTDAAB after spending a day with it.  As a U2 album, it's adequate, but in the scope of general music itself, its better than most stuff out there.  The songs themselves are good, some outstanding, but the album as a whole is somehow lacking.  Not to say that Edge was wrong with the running order, but it doesn't flow well as a whole.

Track by Track

1.  Vertigo:  Massive repitition on those ipod ads have worn me down on this song.  However, I did get happy when I happened to hear it on the radio the other day.  Only because the stations around here think Nickelback, Creed and Linkin Park are the definition of modern rock music.  Again, the lyrics are meh, but sonically it's amazing, I love the groove and feel of it.  I heard a snippet of it's predecessor Native Son, and that small bit far outshines Vertigo. 

2.  Miracle Drug:  Beautiful song, heartfelt and truthful.  However, that baby head line makes me cringe everytime I hear it.  Luckily it's at the begining of the song and you can forget about it quickly.  But nonetheless, it's still there and it makes the song a tad ackward.

3.  Sometimes you Can't Make it on Your Own:  I've heard some people compare it to One.  For that I say, screw you!  It is a good song, it really makes me weep, but nothing compares to One, so don't even try to put anything next to it.   Sometimes... is a deeply personal song, and you can hear it, it's touching and emotive and will make for a great single.  

4.  Love and Peace or Else: eh.  I said elsewhere that I thought it was a clusterfuck.  I believe I also said on here, that it's a song in search of an identity.  Maybe in time it will grow on me, but I dunno.

5.  City of Blinding Lights:  Much better tribute to NY than ""New York.""  Again it has the classic hook that make it catchy, and I woke up this morning with this song in my head.  

6.  All Because of You:  I heard this song previously on the live BBC concert, it sounds better live.  

7.  A Man and a Woman:  Not bad, but I think I need to let it sit with me for a while longer before making any kind of statement about it.

8.  Crumbs from your Table: definately a stand out track.  Yet it reminds me of something else and I can't put my finger on it.  Hopefully this will be played live, because it would bring the house down.  

9.  One Step Closer:  Again, this one doesn't stand out for me, maybe after a few more listens.

10.  Original of the Species:  Still too much Beatles influence here, almost to the point of distraction for me.  But not a bad tune, I suppose.

11.  Yahweh:  Pretty good track, makes for a good closer on the standard album, but wait there is more...

12.  Fast Cars:  Good song, I've been listening to it for a week or so, and it sticks with me.  But from it's location on the album, I don't think it should be the last track.  That being based on Bono's ""pretentious arch"" of the album, it would probably fit more after ABOY instead of after the ""Happy Noise"" of Yahweh.

13.  Mercy:  Tis a shame this didn't make it on the album, I would have taken this over Love and Peace or Else.  What a great track this is, again, I've been listening to it for a week or so, and it definately should have made it on the album.  I blame Larry for this oversight ;)

So as I was saying before, the running order of the album is a tad sketchy...which is why I find it wonderful that I can make my own playlist with my own order.  Technology is a wonderful thing, innit?  So here is my arrangement.

Vertigo
City of Blinding Lights
Crumbs From Your Table
All Because of You
Fast Cars
Mercy
Sometimes...
A Man and a Woman
Miracle Drug
Original of the Species
One Step Closer
Yaweh


Love and Peace or Else would be an extra track, or maybe a quirky b side.  Perhaps buried in a deep dark cave, only to be found hundreds of years later when a future society has no idea what a CD is or how to use it."

See she is still holding onto her cassette tapes, and they are starting to disintigrate, wonder why ;)  And everytime I see her, I tell her that I promise I will do it.  Well finally this morning, since I am up hours before the sun, I finally did it.  So Suzy, I am no longer a bad friend...not I just have to bring them around to you.

Why may you ask am I up at this insane hour....duh, it's U2Christmas. Big big big love for the itunes, in five minutes, I had it.  Although I do have the deluxe version with dvd and book of Larry's doors hopefully on the way from Amazon.  

I've been staying away from fan and journalist reviews, just because I didn't want that to taint my opinions.  Upon more listening than just the casual streams from official sites, Crumbs from your table is just amazing, I can't wait to hear it live (but rumor has it they won't play it).    A man and a Woman is really sticking out in a good way....but for now Im gonna start her up again and give it a second listen...while I look at the digital booklet that came with it."

"event","I've been kinda listening to HTDAAB, just to get a sense of it.  When it's officially mine to hold and keep, I'll probably be able to get a better hold on it.

My initial thoughts on it, very melodic, Sometimes You Can't... really pulls at my heartstrings.  Crumbs From Your Table is going to kick ass live, it's open and wants to soar, but somehow carries the restraint of a polished recording.  Yahweh I've read some compare to Grace (Which ranks at the bottom of the barrel for me anyway).  I really don't see it, maybe it's what Grace should have been.  Of course it sounds like he's saying ""Ya Wait"" which also would make sense in the song.  In fact I think I prefer Ya wait to Yahweh.  Original of the Species, a little too Beatlesque for my tastes, but the piano and orchestra carry it. City of Blinding Lights, again with the beautiful piano (can you tell I loveth the piano). Love and Peace or Else, has a very dirty opening which really wants to explode, but gets defused when the vocals come in.  It then starts to build back up at the choruses and again at the end.  Poor Edge sounds like he wants to go postal on his guitar, but Bono holds him back.  It's unfinished, unpolished and disjointed, It almost feels like they took a full out rocker and overlayed some random ballad over it in the editing room.  The song fights for an identity, I may have to give it a few more listens before I can find it.

So my intial reaction is that it's ATYCLB II, which is not a bad thing, but it is my first impression.  It's not as groundbreaking as AB, JT or Pop, but it's familiar, it's U2, which makes it hard not to love it."

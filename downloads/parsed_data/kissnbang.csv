"event","WoW,I went to sundance yesterday, and saw Crispen Glover's new movie he directed.  After the movie I got to chat with him and take my picture with him.  His new movie is messed up.  Its the first to his trilogy.  I believe he was the first actor Ive met in person, and is one of my favorite actors.  Loved him in Dead man and willard."

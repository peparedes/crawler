I went with them on saturday.&nbsp; It was ungodly hot, and then I had to come home and go to work from 5:30 - 12.&nbsp; <EM>crazyness. </EM>Nicole and I are talking again, which is great.. i missed the girl.&nbsp; I went to myrtle beach with Brenna Lyn, and of course had a blast.. we don't talk too much anymore, im hoping that its because my family is here, so I really can't talk to anyone.&nbsp; I love that girl &lt;3&nbsp; These past 2 months have been great between Billy &amp; I.&nbsp; For a while, we didn't see each other too much, which was hard, but we managed, and now we see each other a lot.. except for while im not here lol.&nbsp; I'm leaving tomorrow for Pittsburgh with the family for a week, and then on the way there, touring Frostburg State University.&nbsp; I'm actually very excited..&nbsp;Hmm.. this entry was filled with a bunch of random stuff, but I just thought i'd fill everyone in on my life since i haven't in like 8724398 years lol.</P>"

"event","<P>hmm.. i try not to complain too often, but lately i dont know, something is wrong, and i just cant seem to make it right.</P>
<P>not sure, but recently ive been feeling.. empty.&nbsp; i feel like my friends are only there to be there, i dont know, its like im completely alone.&nbsp; I really dont understand the feeling, i mean, i know i have great friends, but sometimes it seems like im just there, and i cant seem to fill this empty space inside of me.&nbsp; It's almost like a part of me is missing, ive felt it before, but it seems like lately its been there a lot, or maybe i just notice it more now.&nbsp; In a lot of cases it feels like i cant tell my friends or anyone close to me anything because im afraid of being judged or that im overreacting.&nbsp; but i also feel, not used, but just like i could be replaced&nbsp;anytime by anyone.&nbsp; that feeling really sucks. almost like no1 really cares enough about how i feel to even notice it.&nbsp; ive been trying lately to be nicer to everyone and trying to compliment everyone on lots of stuff, but it seems sometimes like what i do isnt good enough, or like it doesnt matter to anyone what i think.&nbsp; i dont know, maybe i am overreacting, but maybe im not.&nbsp; Maybe it's just because i always feel the constant need to impress and meet everyone's standards.&nbsp; maybe im trying to be too good of a friend.&nbsp; maybe i try too hard to be someone i'm not.&nbsp; Not sure, maybe one day i'll find out, but until then ill keep it inside like always...</P>

So we went back, and at the end, or when the sucky bands started playing we went to brennas, called kristi's parents and brennas parents and tried to take Fez home, and we hit a curb (when we werent supposed to be out) and blew out her tire.&nbsp; After about 5 or 6 different people that we knew came to fix it, charlie came and fixed it.&nbsp; THANK YOU SO MUCH CHARIE I &lt;3 YOU!&nbsp; So we ended up getting back to brennas safe ( about 20 minutes before her parents.. ) THANK GOODNESS!

"event","<P><FONT size=2>hmm.. today was kinda weird.. in 1st period we were talking about life, and ambitions.&nbsp; Ms. Searfoss made some really good points about&nbsp;how you should always live your life to the fullest because you never know when you wont be able to do that anymore.&nbsp; It made me think all day.&nbsp; I thought about how it is true that you should always tell people that you love them because if you dont, you may not ever get the chance to and then you will regret it.&nbsp; And also, when you really want to do something or feel that you really should and you pass up the opportunity because you feel that there will be another.. that really made me think about how many times i've done that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean honestly, what if you fell in love tomorrow, and you were too scared to tell the person that you love about it.. and secretly they loved you back.. what would you do if you went on living life with them not knowing and you never knowing how much you really loved them.&nbsp; That could pass up so many opportunities, its just crazy.&nbsp; Anyhow, I also wanted to say I love you to everyone.&nbsp; I know I dont say this as much as i probably should, but I really do.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

Today, everyone is still sad about mrs cooke, i dont blame them.  Jami might be moving to Japan by the end of the month.. that really sucks. =( Tomorrow is myne & Will's 7 month =D , i dno, im in one of those moods again, i dont know what I want, I dont know what is going on, im just so confused and i dont know why.  It is tearing me apart.  Also apparently people are telling my mom stuff that is making her worry about me, and she has NO REASON TO WHATSOEVER.  I hate it when people do that, i mean damn, its my business not theirs.  It seems like everything is coming down on me and i cant stand it anymore, im not very good at this game called life =( Oh well, ill get through it, I always do, no1 will ever know how I feel.. partly because i dont either.  Another thing is, george isnt talking to me.  I dont know what i did wrong, but mmk, whatever floats his boat.  I dont know, it just seems like everything that can go wrong is going wrong.  I read this thing, omg it was soo sad !

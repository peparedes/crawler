"event","Ok, so i haven't written for a while coz I am in in Broome at the mo'. For those of you that don't know, Broome is a tropical beach town (we have one of the best beaches in the world) with a population of about 13000, and its also the place where i grew up. I come back to visit about once a year. I'm only up here for a few days this time, and they are quickly running out! The first day I got here I went fishing all day. Caught a few fishies, but also caught me some sunburn and sea-sickness! Went crabbing yesterday too. The fucking tourists piss me off so much! We caught three big female mudcrabs but put them back coz then they can make baby muddies. It's not illegal to take them, but most of the locals leave them behind. Anyways, we were just pulling the boat in when this old couple (tourists) come over to us holding a bucket of crabs (2) gloating because we did'nt have any. So we had a look at their crabs and they were both female and full of eggs. So we told them they should really put them back and the wrinkly old farts refused! oOOOHHHH I hate old people! I swear i am NEVER gonna be an 'old' old person. 
Anyway, that's enough of my ranting. Gonna go enjoy the sun...then later off to the races. Gonna get smashed - whoohoo!"

I am sooooo stoked! I gots my tickets already. I was watching their DVD (again) last night and getting ever-so excited. I think I might possibly have a heart attack when they start playing. If you haven't heard this band - check them out. They are gods. That is all."

"event","Ok so I am at work again. The boss is running late WHOOHOO so i get to update my journal.
So, what has been happening lately? Got home really late last night. My bestest friend Jade is in the process of breaking up with the boyf so she needed some comfort. Then on the way home i passed a HUGE car crash...cops everywhere, two messed up cars, ambulance, fire peoples cutting one of the cars open. I found out on the news this morning that two people died on impact, 16 years old. So sad.
Soooo aaaanyway...moving right along...
I'm really peeved because Steve Vai is playing in a week or so and I can't go! Well, actually I can go...but I;m choosing not to. 'The Boy' (his name shall not be mentioned) has a gig on the same night and I wouldn't really want to go without him.
Best be working now.
Ciao Amigo's."

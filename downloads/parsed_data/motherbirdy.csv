OH why did i run out of TEA??&nbsp; now i remember it was something for ME!!&nbsp; kids suck the life out of ME around ever turn and the money in my pocket's nowhere enough to burn. so starbucks is out.. i could use a Grande WIDE AWAKE now.. guess ill just start my day somehow. off to preschool with #2... he's a handfull with to much to do.. his feet don't stop like that little penguin.. happy feet that are never left danglin.. run run run is what he does.. with no rhyme or reason to it... Just because. #3 will stay with me... she is 3 and happy to be! dont' know what we will do till pickup time comes... probably sit home and watch a video. yeah that didn't rhyme but i don't have the time.. So ta ta for now and no i won't take a bow! LOL"

"event","Its not a regular occasion that a man gets tossed through a window, but it sure feels like it. At least in the south side of Silentdale. Silentdale. Ha. A lot has changed since this place has been named. What was probably a small village built on a crossroads by a kind river oh so long ago, has turned into a bustling, but disgusting city. The very crossroads that brought Silentdale its trade and adventurers also brought its thieves and corruption.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been here for most of my life. As far as I know at least. My youngest memories are of running through the dirty streets of Grim Alley. Which is as gross as it sounds. If you&rsquo;ve ever seen a dirty street urchin before, that was me. Rags, barefoot, and quick fingers. I stole for my food, I stole for my clothes, I stole for fun really. I still steal for fun. But don&rsquo;t tell anyone. Shh. Shut up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost track of where I was. Lets go back a few steps. Its not a regular occasion that a man gets tossed through a window, but I sure did. Manhandled, roughed up, and straight up tossed through a window. A closed window, mind you. That sucks. A lot. As I laid there moaning and pulling shards of glass out of my hands and face, the goon that tossed me decided he wasn&rsquo;t done yet and took the easier route though the door to continue my pummeling.
&ldquo;Whoa whoa whoa&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson already don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I pleaded scuddling backwards on my ass trying to get as much distance between me and Mr. Ugly. Mr. Ugly just snorted and cracked his knuckles and lumbered towards me. &ldquo;Shit&rdquo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fumbled for my dagger on my belt and had a bitch of a time because my hands are covered in blood and full of glass. Before I could unleash my death fury on his ass, he grabbed me by my collar and lifted me off the ground with one hand and growled in my face. My eyes rolled back in my head from the stench. &ldquo;Jeez don&rsquo;t you ever brush those tusks? It smells like you ate a dead skunk that shit in your mouth.&rdquo; Bad idea.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next think I know I am seeing stars flash in my vision as his ham fists pummel my poor face over and over again. I fought bravely! Which means I weakly flailed at his face. Thankfully a voice called out from behind Mr. Ugly which caused him to stop pounding my face long enough to grunt and look behind him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerard is a great guy. To me. He&rsquo;s gotten me out of more jams than is reasonable. Me and him have gone though a lot of crap together. And no that crap wasn&rsquo;t always created by me so shut up. Lets just say he isn&rsquo;t the type to be tossed handily though a window.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Gerard said as he faced off with Mr. Ugly, hands casually resting on his sword. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re going to put my friend down and get out of here. Understood?&rdquo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ugly snorted angrily and tossed me back to the ground in the not gentle fashion and turned to face my good buddy. Gerard continued to stand his ground as Mr. Ugly started towards him growling something probably pretty derogatory in that gross orc language. I don&rsquo;t know what he said. I was to busy being super hurt. Mr. Ugly got right up into Gerards face, yelling, spittle flecking into his beard and threatening a pummeling. The mistake came when he jabbed one of his disgusting fingers into Gerards chest. You don&rsquo;t poke Gerard in the chest. You just don&rsquo;t. It was a childhood thing. I&rsquo;m not going to get into it, just don&rsquo;t do it. Mr. Ugly did it however. And you saw the flash in Gerards eyes. I&rsquo;m pretty sure Mr. Ugly saw it too because he stopped his tirade for a split second. And within that split second, Gerard drove his forehead directly into Ugly&rsquo;s nose, destroying it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ugly staggered back in shock and pain grabbing at his smashed and bleeding nose. That probably was enough, but he poked Gerard in the chest. He gone get it. Gerard came at him, with that furious grimace on his face which tells you &ldquo;Oh no sir. You do not poke me in the chest. You sir, will now be mangled.&rdquo; Gerard didn&rsquo;t even draw his sword. He just started throwing haymakers, blasting Mr. Uglys stupid orc face back and forth. Then with a straight uppercut, you could hear the loud crack as his jaw shattered. With a squeal of pain, Ugly staggered and fell to the ground holding his face, rolling back and forth on the broken glass.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I figured now was a good time to say something before Gerard killed the guy. &ldquo;Gerry! Gerry! I&rsquo;m good! He&rsquo;s done. Let&rsquo;s not kill anyone tonight.&rdquo; For a split second, Gerards fury turned on me. Those eyes flashing fury at me. &ldquo;Whoa whoa whoa buddy. It&rsquo;s cool, man,&rdquo; I said holding up my bloody palms. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken care of it. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s very sorry for poking you. Now let&rsquo;s get out of here and clean up, okay?&rdquo; Gerry fumed for a few more seconds, took a few deep breaths and shuddered as he calmed himself down.
&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;m alright,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you out of here.&rdquo; He came over to me and helped me out of the dirt. &ldquo;You seriously need to learn to keep your stupid mouth shut sometimes. How many times do you have to be tossed through a window to learn that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, I get it,&rdquo; I mumbled as I gave Mr. Ugly a swift kick for good measure.
&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; called Kal, the bartender of the newly breezy Choked Ass Tavern, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gonna pay for this mess?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it Kal!&rdquo; I called back, &ldquo;Mr. Ugly here will put it on his tab. Won&rsquo;t we Mr. Ugly?&rdquo; Mr. Ugly only nodded in response between whimpers. And yeah. Mr. Ugly is his real name. What? Did you think I was being derogatory or something? Rude.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerry and I then walked down the main drag away from the Choked Ass towards the ol&rsquo; homestead. Meaning our basement living space underneath a different tavern/inn: The Sparkling Unicorn. Its an interesting place. Don&rsquo;t worry about it.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot,&rdquo; Gerry repeated for the billionth time since we&rsquo;ve met.
&ldquo;You have daddy issues,&rdquo; I retorted as I pulled another piece of class out of my hand with my teeth. &ldquo;What else shall we reiterate about ourselves? I&rsquo;m a thief. You&rsquo;re an enforcer. I get my ass kicked and you kick asses. I&rsquo;ve tried getting us jobs and you&rsquo;ve shot them down due to some sort of moral code. You have a big ol&rsquo; sword and I&rsquo;ve got a big ol&rsquo; dong&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bullshit.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Just seeing if you were paying attention. Also, fuck you.&rdquo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gerry unlocked the bulkhead that is our front door, and helped me limp down the stairs to our humble abode. I collapsed into my amazingly comfy chair with a groan as Gerry went into a cupboard to find something to clean me up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our little castle under the bar is basically a dirt hovel that we made into something livable. We dug a fireplace into the wall and found our furniture from wherever we could grab it. For instance our cupboards were salvaged from a burned down inn. My amazing chair was liberated from the Brinne estate. Liberated. Everything else was built by Gerry or stolen by me. Its home. Its warm, its safe, and there&rsquo;s always a group of flamboyant men upstairs. Ok that might not always be the best but everything has its imperfections. Gerry came back with some bandages, and some awful liquid in a brown bottle. The stuff stings like hell, and foams around my open wounds. I grit my teeth and wait until the small bits of glass slowly fall out of my hands, arms and knees. Then Gerry wraps them up and hands me an ale, sitting in his own chair drinking his own ale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We drank in silence. Listening to our slurps and whatever strange hoopla that was happening in the Unicorn. Eventually, I spoke up. &ldquo;Gerry. We gotta get out of here, man. This city is such a shit hole with nothing going on. The only upside we have is that the Guard is so corrupt they could care less about whatever we are up to. Or anyone else for that matter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been saying that for years, Lucas. And what have we done? Nothing. Sat in a basement drinking and talking about how we need to get out of here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We just need a HOOK!&rdquo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat there expectantly, hoping that something would happen. A sign maybe. A place to go. Something to do for gods sake! But there was no hook. Nothing interesting. Just the sound of footsteps and creaking floorboards above our heads and carts rumbling by outside. I fell back angrily into my chair. &ldquo;This is bullshit. That sort of thing is supposed to work around here! Where&rsquo;s our crazy wizard? Where&rsquo;s our desperate king? Where&rsquo;s the goddamn adventure?!&rdquo; Me and my big mouth.

"event","I&rsquo;m not even sure what to be writing here. Just like any other twenty something in a Starbucks with a laptop in front of them, I feel like I should be writing a script or the next great American novel. Or even the next Twilight. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to have that sort of incredible bit of inspiration sitting in a coffee shop? Its having the greatest thing ever written come flowing out of your fingers that is the dream of any of these twenty-somethings in this Starbucks with the laptops in front of them.
I spend much of my time with earbuds in my ears, having podcasts of all kinds playing through into my head. At the moment, its Selected Shorts. Which are short pieces of fiction read live in front of an audience of world-minded, or trying to be world-minded, NPR listeners.
I&rsquo;ve always found these stories so wonderful, imaginative, heart wrenching, beautiful, and inspiring. And I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be able to find the inspiration to write something like that. Just a short story that can create and fill a world that can take people away for just a few minutes.
Now I know very well that these stories come from everywhere. From all over the world and from incredible writers. Some writers are considered some of the best in the world. Others, never heard of before and never heard of again. But these writers have found a way to connect with an audience, no matter how large or how small. I think it&rsquo;s the unknown writers that give me the most inspiration. I feel that the larger known writers have already made their connections and have a voice, that can write anything and still be considered great. Its those smaller, younger, lesser known writers that have to create something new. Something that can capture the imagination of an audience starting from the bottom and pull the emotions out. That&rsquo;s what I want.
Its not going to be easy. I haven&rsquo;t really written anything good or of substance since before college. It was actually just a creative writing assignment that I found in my piles of crap at home that got that spark in my head again. It was an odd, futuristic sci-fi story of the young adult variety. Teenagers having to deal with some huge evil corporation doing some huge evil corporation things. It wasn&rsquo;t too terrible. I know my teacher at the time loved it. You can read it in her red pen all along the borders of the story. Any criticism that was there was written more like a book editor than those of a teacher grading an assignment. Questions on plot, exposition and character development instead of grammar and sentence structure. Re-reading it and all those notes made me feel like I could write something again.
This writing however, was over 10 years ago. I was a 16 or 17 year old kid writing from imagination. Not from experience. Now I&rsquo;m a 28 year old man, living in New York City and trying to be a true adult and not doing well. Imagination has been slowly waning, being replaced by pop culture, opinions and life experiences. For me, these things make not a fun story. At least not from me. I would much rather create a new world, or build fancifully on the current world like I did back then. The amount of times I have started and stopped a new story is innumerable.
I would like something to write for. Something besides myself. So many years ago I wrote that story because I had an assignment to complete. A one or two page short story. I wrote twenty pages. Why? I don&rsquo;t know. I started and could not stop. The story kept flowing out of me. It felt wonderful. I need a reason to write something. Someone. Or something.&nbsp;"

"event","Just thought I would get some of my thoughts out before heading off to work.

Recently I have been more comfortable financially, at least in the short term. I know I owe money to taxes and to friends who lent me money before. Its difficult to really save. At least it is for me. I should just not be an idiot about it and just do what needs to be done.

Beyond that, I feel like I&#39;ve finally found someone I can build a real relationship. I met Laura though OKCupid, which is always interesting. But, she messaged me and immediately I found we had a real connection. Just nerdy stuff, and theater stuff and whatever else. And of course our first date consisted of us sitting in the back of Bar 9 and making out for hours :p. To the point where if she wasn&#39;t dog sitting at the time, we would have gotten busy that night. That may have been the best thing, because we got together not too long after that and its been incredible ever since. Shes such a sweetheart, a wee little nerd, and she just makes me happy. I really hope things continue in the direction they are going. I really would love to have the support of a girlfriend and partner. I&#39;m already starting to feel it too :)

Now that I&#39;ve gushed on that, *sip of coffee to buy time* I&#39;m trying to think of what I want to do in the future. Working on the new cabaret show On The Spot with Nathan and Patrick and all my friends has really started to get my creative juices flowing again. I&#39;m trying to see what creative content I can get working on. So lets brainstorm:

-Podcast. A comedy podcast of some kind. Improv? Sketch? Some sort of long form serial story? I don&#39;t know. I feel like I want to brainstorm with a few friends.

-Write something. I haven&#39;t written anything of substance since high school. I found an old story I wrote in high school for my creative writing class. There was so much praise written on that thing from my teacher, and I haven&#39;t looked at writing something like that since. I don&#39;t know why. I always wanted to be a creative. A performer. Writing should be a part of it.

-Music. I miss being in God Awful so much. Performing music, no matter how dumb it was, was one of the most fun times in my life. I need to find a way to do that again.

-Comedy. Ive always been terrified of doing stand up comedy. I&#39;ve always said that I&#39;m more of a group comedy person. Improv is a communal thing. A group effort. You create a reality with the help of your fellow improvisers. Stand up... is all you. Its all what you have to say. You have to find whats funny on your own. I dont know how to do that. I should try to learn. At least get an idea.


I think those are good things to get into again. I should take this laptop around with me in case I want to write. Always take a notebook somewhere. Take notes. Use them. For writing or whatever else.

Yup.

Gotta get to work. Adios."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually think this is a great way to get my thoughts out. No one actually used this anymore, so it&#39;s basically a private journal anyway. Sounds good to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Jekyll &amp; Hyde club in Times Square closed, working for that company has become less and less fun as time has gone on. The pub its alright, I guess. But they are slowly taking away more and more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it was an overall cut in hours. No more than one actor on at a time unless its a Saturday night. Therefore, the amount of shifts have gone from about 4-5 per shift (roughly 35 shifts available per week), down to about 15 shifts per week total.
&nbsp; Secondly, they took away our delicious meal. The biggest pull to the pub is that we used to get our staff meals off of the menu instead of the crappy pasta or salad deal we had at the club. About a week in, they took that away.
&nbsp; And finally, the place is just falling apart. Its old, it doesn&#39;t have the same kind of people coming in, its small and hard to navigate, theres a lot of running up and down stairs because the puppets arent automated so every 10 minutes I have to run up stairs to set off a puppet and come back down again, repeat.

However! I still do have some fun. I still get to perform, joke around, and improvise for money. Under the table money too. A nice wad of cash every two weeks its pretty swell.

Now the reason I brought this up is at around 8:45 am I got a text from my boss Patrick saying I put down for about 5 available shifts next week and asking if I would want all 5.

Yeesh. The money would be wonderful, but would my sanity hold? Maybe not sanity, but temper? Once Jeremy left, I knew it was the beginning of the end for me at that place, but ive worked a few shifts since hes been gone (yeah yeahh) and it hasn&#39;t been too bad. I know the other managers well enough now that I can communicate with them.

I just miss having my best friend around.

Anyway, thats that. I&#39;m going to try and figure out this mixtape thing my cousin sent me. Pease brudda"

So here&#39;s the story.

I was sitting in the break room at New World and my coworker Sarah was talking about rediscovering her Livejournal and very much enjoying what she found. So I took the task of finding mine. And here we are.

I read all the way back to the beginning. The angst, the love, the loss, the laughter, the fun, and alllll those quizzes. I truly hope this never goes away so I can remember and look back at how I saw the world between the ages of 16 and 21. 

I almost wish everyone I knew on here from back in the day would all come back for a moment and see all of these things.

And good lord Andy, your angsty unrequited love posts. For christ sakes man. I want to find some of these girls and just show them these posts and have a good laugh because most of them I am now very good friends with now. Thank god I finally got laid because I feel like I would still be pinning like that over women. Gross.

Anywho, thank you LJ for keeping hold of my younger selfs mind. I&#39;ll continue to look back, I promise.

I was going to do that picture meme that J.Shea did, but i only have a limited ammount of time on this computer. Once i get back to salem i will sit down and do it.

as for now...

life is pretty good for the most part. Money is tight, but that will change soon once the pirate museum opens up again. But i have a beautiful girlfriend now, Lauren, and that just makes everything better.

Nope.

I put myself in situations that i know i will emotionally get beat up. And the times when i dont do anything, i beat myself up with all the ""what if""s. its not fun.

this is the first time i have actually updated this thing in months, so yeah.

2007 is a new year and i think its a good time to really start turning my life in the direction that i want it.

I made a new years resolution to lose weight. Thats a huge undertaking im giving myself. I have at least 150 lbs to drop to really be healthy, so its going to take alot of self control, schedules, eating right, working out, and support from all my friends.

eventually ill be a sexy bitch. ha ha

yeah not so much but honestly i think i would feel so much better and be so much healthier if i dropped these pounds. 

So i start now! if anyone has any good suggestions on how to go about this please let me know.

As for the rest of 2007...we'll see. i plan on getting my grades to where they are supposed to be. and i plan on getting another job so i can actually save some cash and move out of my parents house.

those are alot of things i have put on my plate, but i think ill be able to do it.

heres to a new year! cheers."

Its a rut i fall into and just dig deeper the more i try to get out of it. It makes me feel so inadequate that im never able to cross that line from friendship to something more. And this isnt about any specific person. Its a combination of a whole assload of experiences over the years that just pile up.

Where to start...

well this summer i got a job down at the Pirate Museum in salem. that will be a great time. 9 bucks an hour to be a pirate tour guide. sweet :D

The Country Wife has been going so well. We kicked off our final weekend last night. This show has been such a great experience and ive had so much fun. Its been a ton of work too. whats funny is the day the show closes... i have to be ready to audition for next semesters shows, to do it all over again. i love this life. Though it may be hectic and will drive me insane and will make me broke, i love it. Oh and if you havent seen the show and you want to, its now Friday Saturday at 7:30 and Sunday at 2. please make it down if you havent, its a great time and i would love to see all of you.

lets see what else...

we had our read though for Honk! the other day. Thats going to be such a good time, though its really conflicting with my work schedule. Hopefully that will all work out. That show, by the way is June 8th - 10th. come see that too :)

and once all that is over, the good old summer is into full swing. I get to see all my old friends, work will really get going, and of course, Moonlight. I miss it tons, and i cant wait to get back into it this summer. Hopefully it will be something good, especially since i'll be passing up doing Tommy at school... lol.

well theres my life. comment if you wish."

"event","Yesterday was awsome. Had classes, but they werent bad. 

I tried out for HAT, and i did an Aristocrats joke for it. it was awsome.

So last night was pretty damn awsome.

I went to my first concert. The show opened with Lost City Angels. and they were ok, very generic punk sounding band. BUT after them came the main attraction:

Dropkick Murphys

Their set was awsome. Everyone was pushing, shoving and moshing the whole time. As my good friend Nate McNiff   said, ""This concert will be a babtism by fire"" He made sure that i knew that i was going to be in a mosh pit. and i was. oh yes. i was.

My favorite thing was at the beginning of the concert, they announced that we couldnt mosh, which was answered by a chorus of boos. So Nate turns to the crowd next to us and asks them if he moshes, if anyone else would join him. HELL YEAH! so the music starts and he turns to us and says ""Well, if I get kicked out, say hi to the Murphys for me,"" and went flailing into a mosh pit.

A few songs into the set, i see Nates hand out of the corner of my eye reaching for me. all i could get out of my mouth was ""FUCK!"" and i was fully into the mosh. It was pretty fucking awsome.

the whole concert was spent either bouncing between moshes, pumping my fist and screaming, and tossing crowd surfers. so key.

then a party at 7 west afterwards was pretty chill too. Reardon, Savage and Bryce all told their own Aristocrats joke. All hilarious. Mike sang about his dick and we laughed.

so yes that was yesterday.

tomorrow i have Cue2Cue for country wife. whoo... bleh.

PS. I applied to the Pirate Museum in salem. lets hope i get that one.

huzzah!"

"event","wow yeah. i havent actually written in this thing in such a long time.

lets see...

Country Wife is going quite well, although i think it will be the death of me. I did not expect this much work in this show... i suppose i just have this romantic view of doing a straight comedy. Its actually been doing a real number on my psyche, but i will deal.

classes are fine. just going through the motions, just trying not to fail. thats about it with that.

finally on SPRING BREAK BITCHES.
although this wont be much of a break. i have 5 things to memorize, plus a 7 page paper on midsummer nights dream. gah. the only thing i have to look forward to is St. Patricks Day. irish pride. hells yes.

yesterday i spent with the G3L crowd, doing some filming for our next show. Then went back to Bobbys and played guitar hero forever. good times.

aaaaaaaaaand today i am going to help out with the cinderella super sunday.

in fact, i should probably go shower and get going. adios muchachos."

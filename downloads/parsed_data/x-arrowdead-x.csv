You like my favorite band.  They are deep and make you think, and can even move people to tears.  You probably like The Cure as well.  Thanks for being so cool and picking the best band ever.  Never lose your taste in music.  Oh yes and if you do indeed like AFI, wish Davey good luck with his recovery. <p><b><a href=http://www.greatestjournal.com/quiz.bml?Q=738>What band are you?

<br><br>
it's the black clothing and fangs and blood and.. no just kidding. pretty much the former stereotypical punk. black clothing, black hair, black jewelry... it's not grown to the name of former barbarian groups, the Goths.<br> goths are cool because they have really dark, mysterious personas. but remember that not everyone is out to get you and light does people good sometimes.

"event","I never did snow, well it did. But not enough to keep me home. I HATE SOMEONE!!!! Lol. I do, but don't we all? SHe's a bitch, who needs to get a life besides hair, make up, shoppings, boys and dissing people who are different from her, like ""goths"" and ""greebs"". (Look at my icon, i don't believe in labels... What the hell is a dyke?!?) 

Im getting my hair cut in 40 mintues... I'm scared. I don't trust hairdressers... They're scare me. What if something terrible happens and I have this huge chunk cut out of my hair? What if she cuts it really short? What if-- Okay, I should really stop with the ""What if""'s. I mean I am scared shitless that something will go wrong, but it could look really cool... right?

I HATE MSN MESSENGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's not working!!! It wont let me sign in, and hasn't for the past 2 months. This happened to my mum, and she had to get a new computer to get it to work. So i think it will be no MSN for a looooooooong time.

My Good Charlotte tickets came through yesturday! It's the 19th March. So thats....*thinks*.... 17 days away!!

"event","This morning it snowed, but not enough to keep me home from school. I hope it does tonight. I'm starting to hate school, but doesn't everyone. It's okay now, but for the past couple of weeks every thing's been a little messed up... y'know, friend wise? But it's all good now. There's Louise, Caley, Grace, Alex, Laura, Katie, Rosie, Charlotte, Caroline and Sarah. But i think we're kinda split. That is actually all the girls in our class minus two. Cause me, Lou, Caley, Grace and Laura hang out (sometimes with Katie) and Rosie, Charlotte, Caroline and Sarah hang out. But who cares? Lol. 

Today we did jack shit. In IT we updating our Xanga diaries. English we pissed of <i>Miss.</i> Evans. (She has this big thing about how everyone has to call her by her proper name, she shouted at David cause he called her Mrs. Evans). Break. Then Maths, I had Mr. A and he is such a pushover sometimes. This guy, Sam got his guitar out and they stated playing it in the middle of the lesson. Science, not much special happened. History, where i looked at GC worldwide. Then Spanish where me Lou and Alex were mucking about.

"event","Okay, my internet has been down for the past... <i>4 days!!!</i> And seeing as i spend loads of time on it, i was about the put a gun in my mouth. I need to update my fic now... i have it written out, i just need to format it. HTML annoys the hell out of me, but it is often a must. 

So today... well to put it simply, was boring. Like every other day of my boring life. Wow... that's depressing. Okay, I'm going to be happy if it kills me!! Lol.

So tday we had that freaky Polish student teacher again for french. He can't speak English... and he smells. Bad. Then Math, we had no teacher at all, as he/she never turned up. (It was a cover lesson). P.E sucked, like usual. We have to do this sad dance based on going to the beach... like in the 60's, and we have to be all girly and shit. Geography, we had <i>another</i> student teacher, who really needs to go to anger managment. Sheesh, our normal teacher lets us get away with fucking anything. Chemisty, (or is it Biology? I don't know.) we had this lame test. And Art, well Miss. Whitfield needs to get it into her head that not everyone can draw excellently, some of us just enjoy it. So you don't need to tell us it's crap, okay?

Honestly, i'd rather shoot myself in the head than do GCSE art with her. And the other teacher is a plain bitch. 

Later. \m/"

"event","Barring anything unforeseen coming up in the background check (which I doubt, because I am both honest and boring), I will be starting my new job at EMD Serono on August 12.&nbsp; For a great boss and big fat raise and great work.&nbsp; Huzzah!&nbsp; And a 44 mile drive each way through nasty traffic.&nbsp; Huz . . . well, no.&nbsp; But that&#39;s okay.

Even with the hour+ commute each way this is a terrific thing, because I got laid off from Vertex on January 17.&nbsp; I was on the payroll till February 4 . . . and the lump sum severance package paid me through mid-May . . . and generous Massachusetts unemployment got us through after that till mid-June . . . and the weeks since then have been soul-killing.&nbsp; Just . . . crushing.&nbsp; Meanwhile I made it to the final round of seven jobs, in the time between, and none of them worked out.

None of those seven jobs were anywhere even close to as awesome as my previous job, much less anywhere near as terrific as this one -- a big jump up in salary and responsibility, yay!&nbsp; But . . . I was desperate and scared and I often applied to roles two or even three levels below me, and I would&#39;ve taken each and any of them if I&#39;d been offered, just to be working SOMEWHERE again.&nbsp; I always figured I&#39;d someday be grateful for the experience of being rejected seven times in a row (more in that later) but now, with that rejection leading to a better job even than the one I&#39;d gotten laid off from, I am THRILLED.&nbsp; But more than that, relieved.&nbsp; And hopefully done with being scared.

You&#39;d think that my having watched so many better people than I get laid off, in the seven years I was at Pfizer, would have made this easier.&nbsp; Or the fact that I hated, hated, hated my job at the end.&nbsp; Or the fact that I&#39;d already started interviewing elsewhere by the time it happened.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; One of the only things that really helped was all my friends confiding that they, or their spouses, had also gotten laid off in the past and they never told anyone.&nbsp; (I didn&#39;t really tell anyone either.)&nbsp; One of my best friends not only told me that her husband had gotten laid off back when they were living in NYC, but that it took him SIX WHOLE MONTHS to find a new job (me too; the offer came on July 17) and that they completely blew through their savings in that time (luckily we have not touched ours).

Complicating all of this is that Steve and I made the supremely and completely uncharacteristically irrational move of buying that lovely place up in New Hampshire after all . . . a couple weeks after I got laid off.&nbsp; (The previous owners ended up having to sell at a loss in a short sale, and contacted us to see if we still wanted it.&nbsp; For the amazing price they were offering, we did.)&nbsp; Negotiating the short sale with the bank over a six month period was hard enough while I still had a job, and completely nerve-wracking once I didn&#39;t.&nbsp; Boy, don&#39;t ever redo a mortgage at the last minute, on one income instead of two, if you want to keep your sanity.&nbsp; I don&#39;t regret it one bit, but I do have to wonder what kind of crack we were smoking at the time.

Anyway.&nbsp; It&#39;s already nice to know that this dark time is coming to an end.&nbsp; I can&#39;t pretend I&#39;m looking forward to two plus hours of driving every day (especially in my beloved stick shift cars).&nbsp; But hey, it sure as fuck beats the alternative.&nbsp; Everything is just slightly easier now.&nbsp; We are just a tiny bit calmer, a wee bit happier, every day.

<i>Oddly enough things had already started to get a little better around about the time we went up to New Hampshire for Fourth of July.&nbsp; That&#39;s probably the best anniversary of either of us could have asked for . . . but the job offer could trump that.</i>"

"event","it feels strange to post here again, after so long.&nbsp; I can't promise I'll keep it up.&nbsp; I also can't promise not to do the annoying &quot;here's what I was up to all this past year&quot; post, even though I usually find those so annoying and apologetic (what, you didn't post for a while?&nbsp; um, yeah, we all survived).&nbsp; so, random thoughts in no particular order:

- connor is five months old and gorgeous.&nbsp; I stopped posting right when I  got pregnant with him (completely coincidentally) so maybe there are readers out  there that haven't heard my many hellish stories about that time.&nbsp;  not that there were any complications whatsoever from the pregnancy itself (not  even a kidney stone, unlike last time!) unless you count the wholly  unexpected experience of being clinically depressed.&nbsp; never had that  before, in my life.&nbsp; never even came close, quite frankly.&nbsp; never want  to go through it again.&nbsp; when all the crying and not eating and not  sleeping was done, and I was holding a beautiful 6 pound 6 ounce baby in  my arms (so much smaller than we wanted him to be!&nbsp; but perfect all the  same), I was amazed to discover the exact polar opposite of PPD.&nbsp; it  was like a switch had been thrown and I was myself again.&nbsp; I didn't even  have the baby blues, the way I did with james.&nbsp; fucking hormones.&nbsp; and to top it off  connor is happy, and chill, and calm, and smiley, and placid, and easygoing, and an absolute peach of a baby.&nbsp; I have  no idea how that happened, given how miserable I was  throughout his entire gestation, but I am thankful every day for it.

- I'm starting a new job july 1.&nbsp; still in helth-wyzer, but out of IT.&nbsp; in commercial operations.&nbsp; my journey towards the dark side is now complete.&nbsp; I can no longer hide in the ostensibly &quot;good&quot; world of regulatory and medical operations, steadfastly saving the company every last penny I can find; now, my job will be helping the sales force make money.&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; I did my best in development and medical for long enough, people.&nbsp; I'm not superhuman.

- you do a lot of soul-searching when you're told, on your second day back from maternity leave, that your job has been eliminated.&nbsp; I thought that I was already as angry at the company as I could possibly be, given the drubbing I'd taken from my boss the previous year.&nbsp; but this was a new level of rage.&nbsp; it's not that I harbored any particular illusions that, when the chips were down, I'd still be valued by The Company as if we were all living in the 1950s or something.&nbsp; I'd seen far, far too many excellent coworkers callously tossed aside over the past five years to be that naive.&nbsp; but I had worked my tail off, while pregnant and depressed, and I'd expected better.&nbsp; in the end they never quite had the balls to ACTUALLY lay me off (probably because they knew I would sue their pants off, and quite likely collect a sweet settlement too if the company's own past history is any judge) and as referenced above I managed to find something far better even after they grudgingly gave me a shitty project management job to tide me over with.&nbsp; still.&nbsp; I didn't think I could plumb new depths of jadedness but I am even more callous now than before.&nbsp; 

- so why stay?&nbsp; well, to be able to make the move out of IT&nbsp;and into the business is very, very good.&nbsp; it looks PHENOMENAL from a resume perspective.&nbsp; the new job also happens to be very much what I want to learn, and do, and excel at.&nbsp; and all the things about helth-wyzer that have kept me there over the past three years (easy commute; incredible benefits; personal trainer; sweet paycheck) are still there.&nbsp; I'm still learning good stuff.&nbsp; I'm still doing good stuff.&nbsp; but still in all honesty it was pretty surprising to both steve and I that we didn't just leap at the opportunity and make the move to boston.&nbsp; if I'd actually gotten laid off, well, at a bare minimum we would have been looking at 7-9 months of pay in a lump sum.&nbsp; probably two to three times that if I'd gotten all lawyered up and sued.&nbsp; either of those would've gone a long way towards a down payment on a new house.&nbsp; steve can work from pretty much anywhere as an IBM employee, and even in this tough economy my prospects in the boston area biotechs, after five years supporting development and regulatory operations, looked pretty good.*&nbsp; on the other hand, the house is just about done, the property is just about landscaped, and we have made tons of great friends with kids in the neighborhood and are really very, very happy where we are.&nbsp; we basically dithered and sat on the fence long enough for me to find a better job at helth-wyzer and I am not sorry that we did.

- steve has taken up sailing with the husband of one of my good girlfriends, at my incessant urging.&nbsp; I am SO&nbsp;GLAD.&nbsp; I have a couple terrific girlfriends in the city, and a couple of newer (terrific) girlfriends in the neighborhood, and he is always great about encouraging me to go and spend time with them.&nbsp; but he himself doesn't have as many friends in the area (for a number of reasons, many of which begin with the letters I, B and M) so this is one of the few times he has to go off and have guy time.&nbsp; AND go sailing.&nbsp; every sunday afternoon.&nbsp; it's definitely a big time commitment, especially if they all go off and have dinner afterwards, and I'm definitely finding that everyone was right when they told me two kids are really about four times the work of one.&nbsp; the fact that steve can go off and have some Me Time makes it totally worth it, however.&nbsp; and let's face it:&nbsp; when kristine and I take our kids to the SurfSide Club in Greenwich to drink pina coladas and watch our kids scamper around the patio, I'm finding a way to cope.



* I was actually on the shuttle between the two connecticut campuses of bo3ringer ing3lh3im, on my second round of interviews, when I rolled off a voicemail from my soon-to-be boss offering me the job in commercial operations.&nbsp; I accepted on the spot and then had 2+ more hours of interviews where I had to smile and tell them how excited I really was to work there, honestly, really.&nbsp; would've felt wildly guilty about that if I hadn't been so freakin' excited."

"event","in a few weeks I will get my eighth boss in less than five years.&nbsp; in corporate america these days this isn't wholly uncommon (though 8 in &lt;5 years is a little excessive).&nbsp; it still sucks.

I'm more pissed than usual since this woman made such a show of wanting me in her group -- I've seen your body of work, I know you've been bounced around a lot, but I also know you can deliver and I think you need a home -- blah blah blah.&nbsp; I can't fault her for leaving -- she's actually taking a bigger and better job elsewhere within the company, which is pretty fucking hard to do these days and therefore quite impressive.&nbsp; but I'm irked just the same.&nbsp; I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;went out on a limb to work with this woman (especially since I am not exactly any kind of fan female bosses as a rule) and now I have to start all over again once more.

not that the job itself isn't fun.&nbsp; I&nbsp;seem to have stumbled unwittingly into sales, after avoiding it like the plague all these years and even spending $100k and two years of my life escaping it via b-school instead. &nbsp;whatever, if that's where I&nbsp;can do the kind of work that I want to do, then so be it.&nbsp; 

we are taking james into the city tomorrow to the car show, and meeting up with steve's old roommate tim who now works for porsche.&nbsp; there's very little not awesome about that.

I am working from home today (what's my boss going to do, yell at me?) and hoping to get some gardening in before the rain hits.&nbsp; I'd also like a run (for some reason I was a pathetic excuse for a runner all over the treadmill this week) but it looks like easter sunday is the soonest I can do that.&nbsp; I think I will need a nice detoxing run after the catholic mass in bronxville, anyway.&nbsp; I&nbsp;found an old lilly pulitzer dress in the back of my closet that I forgot I bought years ago, and am grateful that I have something cute and spring-ish that cost more than $200 before markdown to wear so that I will be let in the door and not looked wholly down upon.


EDIT:&nbsp; eighth boss, not seventh.&nbsp; I forgot about scott, who was my manager for two weeks and who I never actually met in person until long after I'd successfully lobbied to work for rick instead.&nbsp; he did not take it personally and we get along very well."

"event","this morning on the train I once again got stuck next to a woman who annoys the shit out of me.&nbsp; <lj-cut text=""I'm a bad person for not wanting to deal with truly unhappy people whom I don't even like"">unfortunately, her son goes to the same daycare as jamie, and she always takes the 7:58 express, from tuckahoe, and so do I&nbsp;now that I sit on a hallway of coworkers (including my immensely clock-watching new boss, who's cool with me leaving every day at 4:35 to pick up jamie, but who also quite legitimately expects me in by 8:30), I can no longer take any later train.&nbsp; and the next earliest train is 7:39, which is pretty much impossible for me to catch when daycare only opens at 7:30 and I still have to park the car and then hoof it down the hill to the station after that.&nbsp; anyway, this woman drives me up the wall because she is the single most negative person I've met so far in 2009.&nbsp; I honestly wonder why she stays married to her husband if he's truly the asshole that she describes him as.&nbsp; not that she sounds like a fun person to be married to, but.....last friday's conversation hit its nadir when she talked about how he threatened to &quot;pop her in the mouth&quot; and she supposedly said &quot;go ahead, I dare you.&quot;&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't like to think about the implications of that, nor the possible ethical obligations on me, at that hour of the morning.&nbsp; and now I can't even escape her -- she used to take the train from the middle cars, but she started moving down to the head cars once she saw that I always go there.&nbsp; then today, I&nbsp;hid in the middle car area....but she came down to find me.</lj-cut>&nbsp; so that sucked.<br /><br />then (while nodding in sympathy as she described how despicable her admittedly annoying-sounding in-laws are) I realized I'd completely forgotten to buy my march commuter rail pass.&nbsp; <br /><br />thankfully the kind attendant (no doubt seeing my hapless plight and taking pity on me) took my february one away instead.<br /><br />long day at work.&nbsp; not too bad though.<br /><br />end of the day.&nbsp; making lasagna tonight to use up the last of some leftover bolognese.&nbsp; figure I'll pick up more lasagna noodles from the italian place in grand central since they're extra special yummy.&nbsp; unfortunately -- AFTER&nbsp;I&nbsp;buy the spinach and ricotta and parmesan and some random yummy cheese just for the hell of it, at the other overpriced stores there -- I find out the italian place is all out of lasagna noodles.&nbsp; and the closest grocery store I know of near grand central is a seedy gristedes on 41st and 2nd which really creeps me out.&nbsp; so I'll have to hit the grocery store on the way home anyway.&nbsp; so I'm carrying a big ol' bag of overpriced groceries around for no reason.<br /><br />don't know why but this irritates me a bit and I decide I deserve a treat.&nbsp; I pick up a gelato.&nbsp; mmm, key lime pie gelato.<br /><br />then I see, gelato in hand, that I'm actually in time to catch the earlier train.&nbsp; and there's a convenience store across the street from the train station that might have lasagna noodles, which would give me enough time to get up the hill to pick up jamie by the 5:30 deadline too.&nbsp; what the hell, worth a shot.<br /><br />on the train, as it literally pulls out of the station, I realize I never bought a monthly pass.&nbsp; I bought spinach and ricotta and parmesan and taleggio and aged chevre and gelato, but no monthly pass.&nbsp; I am the DUMBFUCKINGEST&nbsp;yuppie who ever lived.<br /><br />conductor comes over.&nbsp; he is not impressed by my ability to wring a whole $9.16 out of a couple crumped bills and a whole shitload of change at the bottom of my purse.&nbsp; the fare to tuckahoe is $13.&nbsp; I&nbsp;remember from painful personal experience that the conductor will take your driver's license information down for like fifteen minutes, while everyone around you looks at you like you're some smelly vagrant caught peeing between the cars, so that metro north can subsequently mail you a bill for the fare plus administrative overhead.&nbsp; fuck that, I'm getting off at harlem 125th and buying a fucking pass.<br /><br />cue all the jokes about a yuppie with a bagful of overpriced cheese wandering through harlem.&nbsp; (though that's actually not fair since I've been there before a bunch and the station itself is pretty nice.)<br /><br />except, that is, for the motherfucking monthly ticket machine.&nbsp; which, of course, is out of order.<br /><br />I&nbsp;buy a one-way ticket, bitching to myself the whole while, and head back up out to the oh-did-I-mention-freezing-fucking-cold train platform, to catch the train I was originally planning on catching anyway.<br /><br />which is late.&nbsp; fuckfuckfuck it's cold.&nbsp; I&nbsp;decide to call steve and bitch to him, but a woman comes up to me (she's actually the same woman who told us to press the button in the elevator to get up to the platform, never minding the fact that it was already pressed) and tells me that my iPhone is going to give me an ear infection.<br /><br />I tell her I already have a brain tumor.<br /><br />she squints at me, very suspiciously, and actually BACKS&nbsp;AWAY.<br /><br />so the best part of my day was when a crazy woman in harlem actually decided that *I* was more fucked-up than she was.&nbsp; <br /><br />these things don't happen every day, folks.&nbsp; you have to treasure them.&nbsp; I&nbsp;won't say it turned my mood around or anything but it helped.<br /><br />"

"event","so I'm moving offices again, which feels all kinds of weird.&nbsp; the upside is that I finally get a fucking window again (my last two offices have been windowless, and even if I weren't prone to the odd week of totally hypochondriac SAD, well, it would STILL suck).&nbsp; the downside is, I now have a view of a roof.&nbsp; and, distantly, lots of a/c equipment.&nbsp; woo!

still.&nbsp; sunlight, people, sunlight.

the downside is it's been pretty nice to be one of the only people left on a hallway that was never very populous to begin with.&nbsp; this was at its nicest for the first six months I was back at work after maternity leave (pumping breast milk is MUCH easier when no one even so much as walks by your locked door).&nbsp; but -- shocking as this may be to believe -- I'm not entirely an extrovert.&nbsp; I really, really like my space.&nbsp; and my alone time.&nbsp; and while I&nbsp;generally prefer to spend at least 90% of my waking hours being cheerful and social, there are those times when I really need to be alone and recharge.&nbsp; unfortunately, if you're a happy chatty person most of the time, coworkers often get confused and annoyingly solicitous if you DARE&nbsp;shut your door.&nbsp; &quot;hey, is everything all right?&nbsp; are you okay?&quot;&nbsp; rrgh.

the other downside is that it's also an office in a densely populated hall of people in my new group, all of whom have worked together for over a year now, and several of whom -- I am only now finding out -- really wanted my job and don't necessarily understand why I got it and they didn't.&nbsp; oh, joy.&nbsp; 

I'm not complaining, since I've pretty psyched about the job and I don't think it's a mistake that I got it.&nbsp; and I'm not so desperate yet that I feel like taking some of my former mentor's more wacky suggestions (including the one that I cut my hair so that I&nbsp;&quot;look less pretty&quot;.&nbsp; note that she did not say &quot;young&quot; or &quot;unprofessional&quot; or even &quot;cute&quot;.&nbsp; any of which would have prompted me to cut it.&nbsp; but &quot;less pretty&quot;?&nbsp; fuck that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;draw the line at feeling bad for being pretty.)&nbsp; for the most part they're a great group of folks and I'm looking forward to being part of a team that doesn't mostly sit out in groton, connecticut. &nbsp;

- oh yes, and in related good work-type news, I am not laid off.&nbsp; for now.&nbsp; actually I got a fucking awesome job that is so cool I am still processing it and undoubtedly going to get laid off come september (see the bullet point two down).

- however, we still don't know if that means it's okay to have another kid now.&nbsp; logic says no.&nbsp; lesley says, fuck you, logic.&nbsp; but logic generally wins.

- and also, let's be honest:&nbsp; obviously wyzer inetgration happening at the end of the year makes everything interesting.

- james is 13 months and has four molars.&nbsp; damn, kid!

minneapolis was a shockingly nice visit.&nbsp; I&nbsp;did wipe out quite spectacularly on an icy sidewalk while going for a nice morning run, but that was more amusing than anything else, and once I moved onto the road I ended up with a really great workout.&nbsp; mind you, my SIL&nbsp;was a total bitch to steve and her parents, but thankfully she didn't try to blame anything on me for a change, so I was finally allowed to sit back and ignore her drama.&nbsp; it's about fucking time that taking the high road actually works out.&nbsp; on a brighter note I got to meet my nephew for the first time ever.&nbsp; he's adorable.&nbsp; hard to believe that I'm an aunt; we only children tend to not count on these things.&nbsp; speaking of which we're starting to think about giving james a sibling -- strangely enough I'm more hyped about the idea than steve, which is a complete reversal from a year ago.&nbsp; (I&nbsp;LOVED&nbsp;being an only child.&nbsp; but I do want another baby.)

"event","came home early yesterday afternoon to surprise steve with a nice romantic friday night date night.&nbsp; prepped dinner, cleaned the place up, got out all the candles and so on, and then decided to mend an old slip from our grad school days.

found a mending kit and felt very thrifty and virtuous as I mended the slip and two fine gauge sweaters.&nbsp; (I&nbsp;can sew perfectly well, but who sews anymore??&nbsp; that's what the tailor in the chrysler building is for.)

tried on the mended slip, went into the hallway for just a second to twirl around and make sure it still fit.

came back:&nbsp; max was trying to swallow the needle.


needless to say (no that it not a pun) he succeeded, despite my best efforts.&nbsp; so, one romantic friday night date at home wound up being a seven hour odyssey at the vet's office (first half me, second half steve).&nbsp; we went to bed at about 1am.&nbsp; steve is back there with him now this morning.


when this is all over and max is fine, I'll laugh.&nbsp; but we're not quite there yet."

"event","I feel like something has happened nearly every damn day of the last months when I've blocked off time to go running.&nbsp; 

1/3 of the time it's work stuff, and you better believe I'm going to drop everything and run like hell for that fire drill (um, hello, I want a job in 2010).&nbsp; 

but now another 1/3 of the time it's been baby stuff -- our poor kid has been home sick with a fever for what feels like 50% of the last month -- all of which culminated in a trip to the murray hill doctor's office today.&nbsp; (&quot;yup, he's got roseola.&nbsp; no, he won't feel or look or act sick at all.&nbsp; but he'll still be running a fever, which according to new york state law means that you can't send him to daycare.&nbsp; why mrs. o'keefe, why are you grimacing?&quot;).&nbsp; 

and the remaining 1/3 gets neatly divided between doing my regular work (which takes longer than I thought it would) and, well, obssessively haunting the pantry and water cooler and starbucks and pret for fellow helth-wyzer folk news of the next reorg, and gossip on its possible implications.&nbsp; life has been like this for the past four and a half years so I don't know why I care anymore, but when you're working at the largest pharmaceutical company in the world and people actually care how you structure your business, it makes even tech geeks like me perk up and take notice.&nbsp; that, and little old MBA&nbsp;me has dreams of writing all this shit up in an HBR&nbsp;case someday.

anyway!&nbsp; back to bitching about not running.&nbsp; so for the most part I'm thrilled that james decided to wean himself.&nbsp; (mostly.)&nbsp; I certainly don't miss lugging a big-ass breast pump around with me as if I were just waiting for the opportunity to whip open my shirt and feed starving orphans in africa.&nbsp; &quot;open wide, kids!&quot;&nbsp; but, that was also 500 calories a day or so that I am no longer burning.&nbsp; in the first month alone post-wean I've put on four pounds.&nbsp; you couple that with a really, really shitty running schedule and I am NOT&nbsp;a happy camper.&nbsp; 

thank god all my clothes still fit.&nbsp; it's winter wardrobe season now and I haven't worn most of this stuff since 2006.&nbsp; party on wayne!"

"event","after having some poor guy come out to give us an estimate on central air (which, btw -- score!), we wound up getting a new boiler instead.

lest we sound stupider and more sucker-iffic than we actually are, let me at least point out that the dude was totally happy to sell us insulation for the attic . . . but said we didn't need it.&nbsp; he was totally happy to sell us new upstairs windows* . . . but said those weren't the problem.

on the other hand, when we whined about how the upstairs never got warm, no matter how high we turned up the thermostat, in complete violation of the basic law of thermodynamics, god bless the guy for noticing that two of the eight burners on our current undersized, eighteen-year-old boiler are mysteriously missing.&nbsp; just, gone.&nbsp; poof.

we thought we had already found every dumbass thing wrong with this house that its former owners had left us.&nbsp; wrong size windows upstairs?&nbsp; check.&nbsp; all kitchen appliances, plus dining room, plus family room, all on one circuit?&nbsp; check.&nbsp; shower head set a mere 5'5&quot; above the tub floor?&nbsp; hideous fake paneling literally glued to the wall?&nbsp; hideous acoustic tile literally glued to the ceiling?&nbsp; beautiful inlaid mahogany floors painted over where the bookshelves are?&nbsp; three inches of concrete and chicken wire behind the ugly blue tile in the upstairs bathroom?&nbsp; a powder room so small that a skinny 5'4&quot; woman can barely squeeze inside?&nbsp; check, check, check, check, check.&nbsp; and check.

but a boiler that's automatically 25% wasted?&nbsp; that was news.&nbsp; jeeee-sus.

. . . . well, here's to not having to bundle the baby up like nanook of the fucking north every time we put him down for the night.



* the upstairs windows are, technically, new.&nbsp; the listing for our house even said &quot;new windows upstairs&quot; and this was entirely correct.&nbsp; also entirely correct, however, is the fact that the fucking things DON'T&nbsp;FIT&nbsp;the frames but instead leave an inch or so of gap at the top.&nbsp; we have put insulating foam in the gap and are vastly relieved to discover that this stopgap measure really is working."

"event","manager training was, no fooling, awesome.&nbsp; also totally frustrating given all the uncertainty around my job, but hey, you can't have everything.&nbsp; and while I&nbsp;am facing the very real prospect of losing my job over the next six months, the fact remains that I still have one (and my mortgage is paid on time and all that jazz) so I won't whine toooooo much.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would whine even less if my 401k didn't more closely resemble a 101k, though.

anyway, the best part of training was the first morning, when we were divided up into teams and given index cards and masking tape, to see who could build the tallest free-standing tower.&nbsp; dumb old me totally ruined the learning for everyone (turns out one of the other teams had been deliberately set up to win -- exactly how, was the learning) when I decided we could make the tower taller simply by stacking the conference room tables on top of each other.&nbsp; (actually my first idea was to stack a table on top of a table on top of another table, then put a chair on, then have someone stand on the chair, then have him or her hold up an easel upon which was balanced the tower.&nbsp; I guess the fact that the chair was on wheels had some people getting all squeamish.&nbsp; whatever; it's not like I didn't volunteer to stand on the chair for christ's sake.)

it's a blustery, drizzly day, and we're wasting a nice windy night by the fire by driving up to sudbury around suppertime.&nbsp; the original plan was to head out right around james' bedtime, but given that he's on his SECOND&nbsp;marathon nap of the day, we may be leaving later than I'd intended.

in related news I think I was seated near the absolute dregs of humanity on the train to work friday morning and am still trying to shake the shivers.&nbsp; I'd burn my clothes if I weren't exceptionally fond of the outfit."

spent much of sunday in brooklyn w/tyler, loving her new pad.&nbsp; brought her and the baby and a couple six packs over to the red hook ball fields so steve and I could get one more hit of pupusas before the season ends.&nbsp; (of course there's apparently an awesome pupusa place just down the street from us, but it doesn't involve driving ALL&nbsp;THE&nbsp;WAY&nbsp;along manhattan from one end to the other, so we'll save that for winter.)&nbsp; also found it vastly amusing to wander around red hook drinking pumpkin ale in public while pushing a stroller and valiantly trying not to jaywalk.&nbsp; when I win the award for Worst Mother Ever I'll know it's moments like these that made it happen.&nbsp; hah.

have a Mom's Night Out this thursday at the local westchester fondue restaurant.&nbsp; there's nothing that's not awesome about that (esp. since I missed the last one, which was at p.f. chang's) so you know I'll be there with bells on.&nbsp; even though I will be coming off of three days worth of manager training by then.&nbsp; (nothing says &quot;pour me a drink&quot; like three days of learning how not to make fun of your direct reports' outfits.)&nbsp; the really amusing thing in all this is that my company is going through a major reorg (yes again) and my own job is not at all a sure thing (yes again).&nbsp; so this whole manager training thing is really only useful if I wind up staying at helth-wyzer and make director.&nbsp; otherwise, it's three days in the paradise that is rye brook, new york.&nbsp; I've recently decided to [accept james' decision and] wean the baby somewhat, so at least I won't suffer too much if I'm not able to chain myself up to the machine and drain the lizards three times a day.&nbsp; rrgh.

we are apparently going to a late-night halloween party with a superhero theme.&nbsp; I am in favor of this except for the fact that I want to be running my 5k much, much faster than 35 minutes before I put on tights and thigh-high boots.&nbsp; also it starts at 10pm.&nbsp; hmm.

I feel like I've been living my life on other people's facebook walls for the past three months.&nbsp; probably because, mostly, I have.

I&nbsp;went to a happy hour / birthday party a couple weeks ago where eleven of the sixteen attendees called in sick the next day.&nbsp; the fact that I myself did not can be chalked up to mere chance.&nbsp; that, and the judicious choice of which train to take out of grand central.&nbsp; and, my (albeit drunken) command of spanish when the cabbie misheard &quot;valley road&quot; for &quot;valhalla&quot;.

last weekend in ithaca was great albeit quite trippy.&nbsp; you haven't lived till you've walked from collegetown to east hill plaza at three in the morning.

james is drinking from a cup and refusing to nurse at night.&nbsp; this definitely makes my nightly wine regimen easier but has the unfortunate side effect of getting me all weepy and worried that he's weaning.&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; the kid does everything else early so why not this?

we are watching the presidential debate tonight b/c I&nbsp;have high hopes that really really good willamette valley pinot noir can curb the urge to throw baby toys at the TV&nbsp;and shriek in frustration.&nbsp; today was the last day at work for a phenomenally terrific client of mine who, having adjusted to be laid-off with the utmost of cheer and dare I say it snark, is now volunteering for the obama campaign in florida.&nbsp; so our last status meeting was taken up by impassioned, heated, unanimous agreement as to the multitude of detriments of mccain and, especially, palin.&nbsp; this, when all the other participants were all middle-aged white marketers with MBAs.&nbsp; hah.&nbsp; I&nbsp;KNEW&nbsp;my degree wasn't an automatic ticket straight to hell.&nbsp; rather, I have many, many years of hard work ahead of me before I&nbsp;get my ticket, bitches."

I'm in my usual place as I face a week away from steve:&nbsp;  I love being able to cuddle and play with the baby, and there's a ton of stuff I can get done around the house in the evenings*.&nbsp; at the same time, I am really going to miss the extra help getting everyone ready and out the door in the mornings, and frankly -- call me crazy -- I'm going to miss steve too.&nbsp; helping with the whole lonely part is tyler, coming over to stay the night wednesday, which has me irrationally excited.&nbsp; you hate to burst your best friend's bubble and reveal how pathetically mundane your life of parenting in suburbia is . . . but there's nothing wrong with sushi and and wine and crappy movies, and it gives me an extra kick in the butt about vacuuming the basement.&nbsp; (cf my earlier glee at having the time to do housework.)

besides, I can plan a nice menu for a welcome home dinner friday night.&nbsp; that is, when I get over this nasty cold that our plague monkey son has bestowed upon us.&nbsp; sniffle!&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you, james.&nbsp; :)



* I think I'm making it it sound like we're still doing major renovation work on the house.&nbsp; we're not -- or at least, not right now!&nbsp;&nbsp;but with both steve and I working full-time, and with a beautiful eight-month-old baby boy who's crawling, cruising, babbling, eating solid foods, and into literally EVERYTHING&nbsp;he can get his chubby little fingers on, there are an awful lot of general housekeeping chores that simply fall by the wayside in the mere hour or two we have each night to ourselves.&nbsp; call me crazy but I'd rather hug my husband and eat dinner and watch the daily show with him than, you know, fold laundry.&nbsp; so the byproduct of a happy marriage is a whole ton of little nitpicky chores that are just waiting to pounce on us the moment we have some spare time."

"event","I don't really know what to post.&nbsp; my job is awesome.&nbsp; my baby is awesome.&nbsp; my husband is awesome.&nbsp; my house is, dare I say it, awesome.&nbsp; the combination of all four doesn't suck my will to live but it sure as hell takes every fucking minute of my day.

I've taken to working from home on fridays (note the lack of quotes; I'm generally doing real helth-wyzer work about 90% of the time, which to be honest is probably a higher percentage than when I'm in the office) just so I can get shit done around the house.&nbsp; there are so many different ways that this is sad, I won't bother to enumerate them.&nbsp; except, it keeps me sane.

I can run a full half-hour at 6mph these days.&nbsp; that's three 10-minute miles.&nbsp; I'm sure all you serious runners out there are laughing in your adidas at me, but it makes me proud.&nbsp; especially when the aforementioned job means I don't get to run very much as it is.&nbsp; (BUT it's like the only time I get to blow-dry my hair, so I can ALMOST count it in my mental ledger as a job-necessary chore.)


oh and, wish me luck.&nbsp; we're flying out to minneapolis tomorrow morning at 6:15am.&nbsp; am I happy?&nbsp; of course not.&nbsp; am I resigned?&nbsp; well, yes, after six months (and this whole thing being my idea in the first place), yes I am.&nbsp; am I too fucking glad that we're flying first class and I get free champagne the whole way?&nbsp; no, no I'm not.&nbsp; because you can't BE too glad to get champagne at six fucking fifteen ack emma in the goddamn motherfucking morning.&nbsp; and oh by the way, yes that's right, keep it coming."

"event","I spilled some latte on the floor this weekend at starbucks, then in essence blamed the baby and said it was spit-up.&nbsp; (for all of you out there that are castigating me for this:&nbsp; you know you would do exactly the same thing if you had a baby.)

also, he's seven months old and won't be scarred by this.&nbsp; other things, yes.&nbsp; this, no.

also, I spilled latte on the floor to avoid spilling it ON THE BABY INSTEAD when jostled by a rather emo-looking 25-year-old.&nbsp; and if you're 25 and still all emo, you need to get a life and stop hanging around fucking bronxville on a beautiful saturday morning.&nbsp; jesus christ.&nbsp; I half suspect he was wearing brooks brothers too."

"event","tons&nbsp;of not-wholly-lame stuff to post about but I don't feel like it right now.&nbsp; however:&nbsp; saw my old high school girlfriend* way back in november (weekend of my baby shower) and we had an absolute blast catching up.&nbsp; mostly b/c, well, she's awesome.&nbsp; but anyway, I was mildly amused to hear how another friend of ours (and now only a friend of hers**) is doing.&nbsp; apparently said girl was still with her college boyfriend and about to buy a house with him.&nbsp; I'm ashamed to report that I made some comment to steve later like, ""yeah, she's a mess.&nbsp; I give them a year, tops.""

um.&nbsp; saw that same girlfriend last week and yup, the other girl and her boy have since broken up.&nbsp; not happy to be right.&nbsp; not happy that I'm mildly amused, either.



* I tend to use the term ""girlfriend"" to mean ""good friend of mine who's a girl"", just in case anyone's reading this and thinks I was way cooler in high school than I actually was.

** originator of the second (there are only two) evil letters I've ever received.&nbsp; the first one was much better, really, because it contained the words ""you two can go fuck like rabbits for all I care.""&nbsp; but for the record, we didn't."

screwing with your baby 101:&nbsp; lesson one, playing folk songs in the car

the best verse of ""poor howard"" is the one that goes, ""jay arthur rank with a great big gong"".&nbsp; because steve can change ""gong"" to ""dong"", ""schlong"" or, my personal fave, ""bong"".&nbsp; 

but that usage of ""bong"" pales beside hearing my husband warble, at the chorus, ""left us here, TO SMOKE THIS BONG!"" as our six-month-old baby giggles in the background.

luckily it's an obscure enough folk song that I don't think he'll get in trouble at daycare if/when he learns to repeat us.


(and yes, tyler, I fully expect to teach him to sing ""the girl with colitis goes by."")"

"event","&nbsp;Hey loves!

So I think I've made a crazy decision!

I am going to drop out of university and go to college!!!

I applied last night to colleges and I am going to become a TRAVEL AGENT

You can get jobs at hotels and airlines and cruise lines and spend a few years away from home and travel a lot!
Which is sooo what I want to do!!

PLUS, if I eventually want to settle down its so easy just to get a job at a travel agency in like ottawa or somethign...or even here in cp!!

The course is only 2 years. And less than 3000 a year so im spending way less money!
I would still live where I am and just bus to algonquin for my classes...only 30 mins or so.

This is finally something that I'm interested in.
I just decided this because I went on to my infoweb thing a couple of days ago and I have to declare my major
so for the past couple of days I've been trying to decide what I should take next year
and almost nothing at ottawa u interests me
So then I started looking in to different things and I think this is something that might actually work out!!

So keep your fingers crossed that I get accepted!!!!"

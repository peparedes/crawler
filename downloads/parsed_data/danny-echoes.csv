"event","<p>yeah, i'm lost again.<br />too many thoughts run through this head.<br />i'm scrambled, wasted lost like the dirt caught underneath your fingernail.<br />i wish i could've felt the wind lift me off my feet so i could see myself fail.<br />i know that i'll never fly, i know that i'll always be, exactly what i hate.<br />i'd rather lay alone in bed, with so much time to contemplate.<br />every action, every motion, every time your hips touch mine.<br />every step, every slip, every moment where we lost time.<br />i'll take these notes and melodies in stride.<br />this time, i'm making this moment and running with it blind.<br />i'll come to the fork in the road, where the it's the road less traveled and the road always known.<br />and i'll keep running straight and i'll make my own.<br />i'll pound my feet until their weight is like bricks and stone.<br />someday, somehow, i'll make my way back home.<br />i'll make my way up to your door step and ask myself ""what should i say, what should i do?""<br />and i'll take a deep weazy breath, and say with all my heart, until my face turns blue...<br />""dear ______ ...&nbsp;do you know how much i adore you?""<br /><br />i don't know where this came from, but i kinda like it.<br />it popped into my head after watching <em>Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind</em>.<br />so ... yeah.</p>"

"event","That i create one of these. I've had like 7 in the past 4 years, and this will be my last. 
I feel like because I've gotten older it's easier to write about things, or even have things of relevance to even write. 
I guess I'll start with what's new in my life and world. 

Well, for starters i'm realizing slowly but surely that everyone in this town, are robots. Robots that are all programed to like the same music, and hate the same people, and dress the same way. I'd be lying if i said i don't look like everyone else, but i don't go out of my way to buy what's in style, i buy what attracts me. Now i'm not trying to sound like i'm better then everyone, or better then anyone person, i'm just saying it sucks being the only person who realizes these things and wants to do something about it.&nbsp;

Which brings me to another thing, my band. This band was started to prevent as much violence at shows as possible. We're not trying to save the god damn scene or anything, i just want to play a show, where everyone gets along, and no one seems to support it. Which makes me feel like it'll never happen =\. Well I'm at least going to try, and if i fail, well then i fail, there's not much I can do about that.&nbsp;

I've been meeting new people lately. Some boring, some have my attention. We'll see how things go.&nbsp;

That's all for now, softball practice and then probably nothing. 
WORK TOMORROW!!! Is it weird to be excited for it?&nbsp;

Bamboozle this weekend. 
hope to see you there."

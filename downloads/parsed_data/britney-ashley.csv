"event","I really have nothing to say but I figured I'd write something! Okay, so here it goes! I am now coaching cheerleading at my little sister's school and we have a christmas show on the 18th! I am so excited! The girls are soooo cute!
Next,
The day before last, I went to the gym and I ran and worked out til I threw up. I guess I over worked myself. Whoops!
But anyways, 
I'll write again later! 
I am watching Bewitched!

"event","I am in a better mood today. I am thinking about all the funny things that my cousin and I have pulled in the past. I think this one takes the cake though. A while back the manager at the burger king on US1 gave me like 50 of those gift cards. They all had one dollar because that's how they start off. Anyways, saturday night my cousin and I were hungry and I found the cards in my underwear drawer (I know thats a funny place to stash them). I took like all of them. we didn't think it would work but we were going to try and order food with all the cards. So we get there and we order and it came out to like 13 something. So we drive up and my cousin hands them 13 cards and some change. The kid goes ""what the hell?"" and Daniel, Gabii, and I start laughing hysterically! To our suprise it worked! It was hilarious! They had to ring each of the cards individually so we had to wait in the parking lot for our receipts. So, we're sitting there eating our food and they come out with 14 receipts and our cards and they say to have a great night. I couldn't believe it worked! We then go to mcdonald's after that because Gabii doesn't like burger king and while we're ordering Gabii's food, we see a homeless man. My cousin and I asked eachother if we should give him something. We didn't have any cash but we had burger king cards so we called him over and we told him that we can't give him cash but that we had these cards and burger king will take them and they'll work. So we gave him like 20 of them. he then told us to have a merry christmas and God bless us! I was so happy. It's so rewarding to see him happy even for a second. So after we get Gabii's food my cousin drives back to burger king to let the manager know and the manager said it was fine and that he won't turn the man away. Anyways, we did it again last night. It worked again. I couldn't believe that we had pulled that twice in one weekend. It was hilarious. Then last night for some reason I couldn't sleep. I was up til 4 a.m. doing nothing but sitting on my bed and writing on the computer. It's good that I am not the only insomniac in the world because my phone kept ringing til 5 so at least I had something to do. I don't know what tonight holds but I can't wait."

"event","I am sitting here in my room and I don't know what to write. There are just so many things running through my head that I am having a problem writing a complete thought. I am kinda sad right now. My best friend Christian Oliva passed away in a car crash on november 11th and I can't seem to get over it. I don't understand how God can part the ocean and make a blind man see but he can't bring someone back. I miss him so much. I want my best friend back! I cry over it all the time and I can't stand how people tell me to get over it. I bet if their best friend passed away they would be sad just like I am. I hate it when people judge and they have no idea what it feels like. I pray they never do though. This is pain that I wouldn't wish on the devil himself. I sleep with his shirt everynight and I miss him so much. He was my best friend...I can't believe he's gone. I can't even explain how I feel...I can't put it into words. That kid would spend nights over at my house and sleep in my bed with me. We would spend the whole night talking and laughing and goofing off and I am sad that we'll never have that again. I just miss him. 
Another thing thats on my mind is school. I am dropping out and getting my GED so I can just start college. I am sad about this but to be honest, I hate high school. I can't really explain that either. If you know me, you know that high school has been hard, and is filled with things that I'd rather forget forever. There have been some good times but for the most part, It's been sad and heartbreaking. I just want to leave it all behind. I know that everyone is thinking that this is a bad decision but it's what's good for me. It's what I need...
I don't really know what else to write but I will get back to it later..."

Well, This is my first live-journal entry so I figure I should tell everyone who I am. My Name is Britney && I'm a Senior at South Dade High School in Homestead, Florida. I'm 16 so I'm pretty young to be a senior but I wouldn't have it any other way. Many People Look at me && see who I play myself off to be. That Perfect Little Preppy Girl thats constantly Laughing && Smiling with all the Beautiful People in My Own Little World...or just the girl you constantly hear all the dumb girls talk about. Some People also feel that I look like a Rich Stuck Up Laguna Beach Type...I'm the Farthest Person from that stereo-type. All that aside, Everyone is Going to be able to see who I really am now. Read about all my ups && downs && maybe finally realize I'm human underneath it all. I do have bad days && I do cry && My life isn't the perfect fairy tale I make it look like.

So Get Prepared to see me in a Truely Intimate way that no one really does...
(This Journal Thing Is Pretty Cool Already)

Stay Sweet && Smile Always,
Britney Ashley xoxo

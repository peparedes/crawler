I'm just like this is my life I can be with who ever I want when ever I want with or with out your permission and if Nic, Ray and them don't like oh well thats their problem I'm not going to stop doing everything I love doing because they have a problem with it or because you guys have a problem with it I have enough problems going on that I need to slove and all I am doing by going out with Ricky everynight is so that I can take my mind off all of that shit and not worry about it and just have a good time an kick back for awhile but no apparently I'm not suppose to be out having fun and hanging out with guys I'm suppose to be out with the girls because thats what I am an only that way I will stay out of trouble and all this fucking bullshit how the fuck am I suppose to stay out of trouble by hanging out with the girls if I don't get along with girls and all I ever fucking do with them is fight all the fucking time yea thats going to me out of trouble of course it is oh well I just need to put up with all this bullshit a little longer after I'm done fixing all my problems I'll be good and done with everything no more hanging out with the guys, no more dancing and no more hanging with the girls to much shit happens when I do all this shit so I might as well stop and hopefully I won't get bitched at now for stopping all this oh well fuck it I don't care anymore"

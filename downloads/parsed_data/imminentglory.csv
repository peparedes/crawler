"event","Grr.  I want to drive down to Chicago tomorrow, but Gabby has managed to become unreachable by virtue of her phone being EVIL.  She's apparently ""not available"" or... something.  I hope she turns up before long; probably I'll just drive down tomorrow anyway and hope she's around.  Cross your fingers for me, and if I don't talk to any of you between now and then, have a happy new year."

"event","Merry Christmas, all! (or whatever you want to be celebrating.  I just currently happen to be celebrating New Stuff and being lazy with my family and cinnamon rolls and tradition, which means Christmas to me.)

Later on I'm going to have to visit with relatives, blah.  But currently I'm up to my knees in weird useless things and also a CD player/stereomajig for my car (which has been graciously fixed by my daddy), yay!  and lots of chocolates and a lovely red shiny picture frame from my sister which makes me wish I had my photos here with me, because I need to choose a good one for it.  I got Return of the King to go with my other two, and my sis got the whole set and discovered that the 3 movies end-to-end are 11 hours, 20 minutes long.  Perhaps one day I will be lazy and stay home all day and leave them on continuously.  I will, of course, make no pretense of watching them all.

In a couple of days I think I'll be going back to Chicago and trying to have some sort of adventure.  There may be rumours going around that I'll be unveiling a new screen name in the new year, but such rumours are heretofore unfounded.  Probably.

Festivity to you all, and I'm off to play with my things and my pretty little puppy who has a new toy of his own."

"event","I have too much time to think.  But let us not complain about those things right now.

Today I was driving uptown to get my last check and buy some last-minute Christmas presents when my gas light came on.  Oops, gotta buy gas.  So I did.  And then my car didn't start for a couple of tries, and the steering was sluggish and stuck, and the battery light came on, and the temperature gauge went all the way to the top.  So that meant my sister coming to pick me up, and she drove me around town.  Long story short my car needs fixed again.  AGAIN.  I need a new car, badly, but there's no way I can afford it.  

That's actually one of those things I've been thinking about too much.  I am not good at all with money.  I am in debt and I need to get out, but I'm not sure how.  I need income, for one thing, and I need to stop spending so much money.  I think I have this urge to buy things for myself because I think it will make me better, and I want to buy things for other people because I have this urge to take care of everyone else.  And rationally, why should I have to take care of other people?  I'm not capable of it all of the time.  Mostly I want someone to take care of me once in a while.  I don't want to be strong or dependable or independent.  I want to be bought things and complimented and pampered and I want to not feel guilty about accepting it.

Uhh, and that was our spontaneous soul-searching for the day.  Sorry about that, after promising not to.  It helps to get it off my chest.  Maybe if you know I shouldn't be buying you things, I'll remember better.  Or maybe my logic isn't quite on keel yet.  Probably a lot of the latter.

Ack.  I need a hug.  Or lots of them."

"event","Winter is not my thing.  Hot chocolate, cookies, fruitcake and all that jazz - they're good enough, but I really wish there was some room in the fridge so I could make some Kool-aid.  Snow?  Pretty, but I'd rather have dead grass (of course, live grass would be best).  Buying presents for people at a forced time when you have no ideas?  Give me a break.  This is probably not a good time for me to be writing an entry, but I promised.

Wednesday Peter and Em and I drove down to Chicago, and Thursday we and Gabby took Peter to the airport where he departed for the far-off land of Australia, much to our sorrow.  More to our sorrow was that he never called to tell us he got there alive, and we periodically commented on such throughout our residence in Chicago.  But I digress.  And I shall continue to digress!!  It's ridiculous that the airport wouldn't let me in the duty-free shop.  I love the duty-free shop more than my own feet and they should respect that love.  Anyway.  Then we went downtown and paid Gabby's rent, and then we kind of went into Marshall Field's and then we left.  Okay.  Next day: . . . I can't really remember.  Generally the whole trip involved a lot of them watching movies and me cleaning Gabby's apartment because she doesn't do it, and me spending lots of money on things I'm pretty sure I need and then feeling guilty-sick about it afterwards.  I have new boots and some of the coolest pants ever, and I bought some Christmas presents for my mom and sis.  I got my ears pierced again, but I think the piercings are kind of crooked and so I think I'm going to let them heal.  Which sucks after I paid a lot of money for them.  Everybody else seems to think they look fine, but everybody else WOULD say that, so I'm going to ask my mom's opinion when she gets home.  Yesterday Em and I drove home and Indiana became a vast wonderland of SNOWY BLIZZARD DEATH.  I'm not so good at estimating, but I'm certain there was at least a foot and a half of snow on the highway.  Seriously.  People at rest stops kept telling us they didn't think we'd make it, but my cell phone called my sister called the internet which told us that it was all lake-effect and dropped off shortly into Michigan.  So we survived by listening to Men Without Hats and playing with sparklers and Tetris.

I have decided for once and for all that Chicago is not a place I want to live.  It just doesn't feel like it's worth being in for long periods of time or... I don't know.  It's not right.  There's nothing to do that doesn't involve spending lots of money, at least in the winter, and spending lots of money is the last thing I need.  Maybe there's nowhere that's a good place for me to be.  But I'm glad now that I didn't move there, because I don't think I'd be happy.  Not that I am now but still.  I'm supposed to go back after Christmas and spend ca. 3 weeks there, hopefully getting trained at Blockbuster so I can work up here, which would be nice because I really need the money.  Hopefully I can refrain from spending a lot more money when I'm down there then.  I don't know if I'm capable of it, every time I turn around I'm in a restaurant or a store or I'm just not caring about it, and it's going to crash me, I know.

I knew I had issues but I think I'm just now figuring out what some of them are.  Last night Peter IMed me and my phone woke me up, so I got up and talked to him for a few minutes.  He seems excellent and indeed I am jealous.  The bad part was that I couldn't get back to sleep after that and I spent two hours crying and writing in my journal, things which probably would look different by daylight.  Everything is so much different in daylight, just as much as things are different in winter and summer.  Still it's true what I wrote and I should probably read it again and see what it was.  I need to stop writing such angsty entries.  Blah.  I think it's just an effect of winter that everything makes me want to cry, even fluffy little bunnies and fun games.  Everything.  It sucks.  We should all pick up and move south, because this is not a reasonable place to live.

Bitch bitch bitch!  Maybe I'll update later if I feel better, I hate to leave this at the top of my LJ.  I just feel so trapped and Chicago didn't make it better like it should have, and I don't know what to do."

"event","Last night - woo, party!  I spent most of the night being followed around by this girl named Tiffany.  She's my new friend and she's eight and she did my hair up reeeeaal pretty.  She also likes to ask things like ""Do you have anything I can have?"" and ""Who do you think is nicer, me or your sister?"" and I'm the nicest teenager she's ever met and she can't wait until she gets to come over and see me again and maybe we can have a sleepover.  I hope I never have any kids that annoying.  She also took about eight thousand pictures with my phone, if you want to see them.  They're mostly blurry.

I'm still stuck at my house because my dad is trying to fix my car and it's not cooperating.  Although just as I was typing that he came in and said he was done with it.  It's still not right, but it's better, I guess.  Nasty car.  Anyway, I guess I better make the snowy and dangerous trek back to dormland so I can study for the rest of my tests tomorrow.  At least I brought my Anthro exam and wrote it while I was here.  That's the biggest thing I had to do, and now it's all guesswork studying.

Joy!

Seriously though, I'm relieved to have my Anthro done.  Now I should go finish everything else and then I can have glorious free time instead of stranded-at-my-house free time.  And I can stop eating cookies.

Happy Holidays everybody.  I made you this: |^ It's a pointy candy cane.  Don't eat the top."

It feels strange to know that there are so many people you're no longer going to see on a regular basis.  I never did like my job very much, but I loved the people I worked with.  Even the ones I didn't like.  They made me promise to visit them and I told them I'd bring cookies.

"event","I am totally not sick anymore.  Except for the coughing.  But I expect some degree of illness in the beginning of December.

What's that, you say?  Yes!  Today is in fact December first, and that means there's only a month left of 2004.  No longer will our dates be easily divisible by two - but that's okay, because you know what comes next?  <b>2005!</b>  And 2005 is practically the future.  I'm holding out on getting a new car until the flying ones come out.  Who wins the battle then, snow?  I do!  Because I don't need no freaking traction.

I expect 2005 to involve some large degree of change, though as of yet I have no idea what that change might be.  It will be the Year of Surprise, I suppose.  I am hoping that said Surprise has something to do with small fuzzy animals and being given large amounts of money.  All shall be revealed in time.

Oh boy, today I might have to give my speech.  Le sigh.  Speeches really irk me, they do, I can tell you that.  Still I suppose it must be possible to get this over with.

But hey!  I'm totally not sick anymore."

"event","Why is it that all of my entries are either very short or terribly long?

I wish I had animal crackers to eat.  Although I'm not entirely certain that it would be a good idea to do so.  Last night my throat was like ARGHEHH! (there are certain things I can't describe with words, which is probably a bad trait for an aspiring writer).  Anyway, this morning my throat was more like AREGHHEHHSHH! and then it quieted down to arghehh.... which was good because my stomach was starting to imitate it, and I couldn't very well go to class like that.  So I made myself throw up, because I knew it was going to happen eventually and I didn't want it to happen at a less opportune time.  And then, feeling slightly better, I went to class - surprisingly not late, because I'm slow and tired-feeling today despite getting a reasonable amount of sleep.  And then I sat in the corner and took some notes because she gave us some notes, but said notes are rather scribbled and probably undecipherable upon further review.  Then class was over!  Hurrah!  So I descended the stairs from the third floor to the second, where I felt the sudden urge to explore for a bathroom.  Damn trick stomach.  So after that fun foray into the realm of sudden sickness, I meandered back to my room where I am currently sitting, trying to convince my body that going to Spanish is good for me.

Did I neglect to mention that I'm also rather dizzy, and my head hurts like whoa, and I suddenly remembered that the ibuprofen I took to remedy that probably isn't at work anymore?  At least I'm not coughing or sneezing anymore.

Much.

By the way, does anyone know what the symptoms of flu are?  Or that the word ""influenza"" is derived from the Latin ""influence,"" because of the belief that sickness was due to the influence of the stars?  (Reeding makes me smrt.)

Hopefully I am much improved by, say... tomorrow afternoon.  I have to give that speech I panicked out on the first time.  This week is sucking a lot."

"event","I got a whole two and a half hours of sleep last night.  Er, this morning.  Between, say, 4:45 and 7:15.

Hurrah for Thanksgiving break beginning!  I'm gonna sleep in my nice toasty house tonight.  After I eat yummy cookies and make my mom play Scrabble with me, of course.  Yesssss.

Last night was... mixed.  The beginning and the end kind of sucked, but there was some fun in between.  Unfortunately not the kind of fun where I got hit on, or didn't look like I was freakishly young, or didn't get cornered by creepy people, or could breathe or anything, but it was probably better than studying.  I guess.  In retrospect it doesn't sound that great.  There was music, though.  And decent people-watching.  And we got to say ""dancin' in Lansin'"" even though my away message wouldn't work because it hates me.  Peter seemed to be having a grand ol' time.  I liked the car ride/people at least.  Despite sitting in the middle and having my poor stepped-on foot die of foot cramps.  It wants foot pity now.  See it cry!

I want food.  And sleep.  But it's too late for sleep now.  And too early for food.  Because apparently I told Peter I'd eat with him and then he went and slept for a long time like a normal human being.

I can't find my camera or the thing to put my fish in.  I'm wondering if my fish would like to live in an old 20oz Mountain Dew bottle, but I can't find the net either.  I hope I didn't put it in my house.

I've decided that I would be okay with being single as long as I had somebody to buy me things and tell me I'm hot.  In continuation, I probably don't deserve a boyfriend (etc) because I would take advantage.  Damn me!

I need more people to talk to so I don't have to write long rambling LJ entries.  I've been wanting to comment on other people's entries lately, but I don't know what to say.  I'm terrible at advice and that sort of thing.  I think I haven't gotten enough of it to be able to give it out.

In other news, I had a panic attack and couldn't breathe and skipped out of half of speech class - the half where I was supposed to give a speech, of course.  It was great.  Now I get to just barely miss having enough credit to make the requirement!  Yay, screwing myself over!

Ugh.  I don't know what I want for Christmas and my relatives are going to start asking me tomorrow.

I should stop going on now."

!@#$%.

Also my loan whatsamapeople are !@#$% and I had to charge $527 just to take the hold off so I could register.  And they probably won't give me the money now because they're !@#$%.

!@#$%!

But I have a schedule now, and while I was unable to get Fridays off without taking classes I didn't want, I did manage to compress everything into convenient blocks of time in order to get it over with.  (I opted for Friday classes instead of crappy classes.)

School hours:
M - 10-1
T - 10-2
W - 10-1
R - 10-2
F - 11-1

Classes:
German I
Cultural Anthropology
Cultures of the World
Nature of Language
Intro to Literature

Hopefully it works out - unlike everything else in my life.  !@#$%!"

"event","Attention Everyone:  <b>Don't</b> let me whine anymore.  Or at least respond when I start whining.  If you want to hear about it, say so; if you don't, tell me to buck the hell up and be glad I still have legs.  Something like that.

This morning I got up with every intention of going to class (though with no expectations of learning anything), then I took a shower.  Then I cried because I'm a whiny little bitch and I like to feel sorry for myself.  Then I got dressed.  Then I realized that I had only washed half the shampoo out of my hair.  So I took another shower.  Then I cleaned and rearranged my room.  Now my computer is in the other room, which hopefully will make me more productive and less paranoid.

*deep breath*  I've spent most of the last month feeling like hell, physically and mentally.  I wish I had a magic machine that could tell me why.  Maybe it's that I'm malnutritioned and underrested and stressed about a million things I can't do anything about right now.  Today I think I'm going to try eating something besides chocolate and Coke.  Even though I haven't really been hungry lately.  I need to stop worrying about how I worry all the time, because it's not accomplishing anything.  I don't know what else to do, though, because I don't like any of the other things I have to do.

Somebody give me a kick in the arse and tell me what to do with my life!"

"event","I have no one to talk to.  I'm listening to the most annoying music I've ever heard and I can't make it stop.  I'm not tired.  I can't think straight enough to write.  I haven't been able to think straight since... well, I'm not sure.  Maybe I've never been able to think straight.  Maybe I've always been able to think straight and I just don't know it.  Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.

Back on track.

I'm really bad at staying on track.  I should be writing my nano but there's too much light and noise in here and I feel like I'm being watched.  I am kind of tired.  I wish my arm didn't itch.  I worked today with a new woman who is one of the most annoying people I've ever met and as far as I can tell, there is nothing in the world that we agree on.  I have to be nice to her anyway.  I hate being nice to people I don't like.  I wish people would just leave me alone.  Except for the people I like, which are probably all the people who end up reading this.  You've all left me alone right now, though.

I like my little fish.  They're really super cute.  I don't know why the one of them is so small, though.  One is growing a lot and he's about twice as big as the small one.  I don't know why I assume they're all male.  Maybe ""he"" is just shorter to type than ""she.""  Maybe it's ingrained into my brain.  Maybe that rhymed.

Now my leg itches too.  I don't know why this is such a stream-of-conciousness entry.  I really hate this music.  I wish I had headphones.  I wish I had nowhere to be tomorrow.  I wish I had someplace fun to be tonight.  Earlier Hope and I watched this weird movie called Battle Royale that involved people killing their classmates.  It was bloody.  I'm not really into blood.  I like talking through movies though.  It turns out I suck at DDR quite a lot, but I don't really mind because it's fun anyway.  I wish something would magically happen to make tonight good again.  I wish I had my own room.  I wish I had my own island.  If I had my own island I would let a lot of people stay on it with me in my island mansion.  I kind of want to go to the casino.  I hate that they lock the doors after midnight.  Here, not at the casino.  That would be strange.

I think I'm going crazy.  Not just tonight, though.

Also I keep opening my Nano file and closing it again without changing anything.  Make me stop!

And I keep realizing I've been tapping my foot really fast.

And I keep editing my LJ post.  This.  This post."

Today is Election Day.  I don't really feel like driving all the way home to vote, but I will.  Because if I don't I'll have to stab myself for being a politically indifferent slacker.  Damn slacker.

I wish I had ice cream."

"event","Okay, maybe I should elaborate on that last cryptic entry.  It's not just that I don't like people.  

It's that a week or two ago I was doing wonderfully, or at least I felt wonderful; and now all of a sudden I feel incompetent and overwhelmed and helpless and clueless and I want to hide in a warm corner and never come out again.  I don't want to study, I don't want to work, I don't want to go outside, I don't want to talk to people I don't already know, I don't want to make things, I don't want to get things, I don't want to try.  What <i>do</i> I want, then?

I want to go to Chicago in the summertime with Emily and Peter and Gabby, and I want to walk around in the sun exclaiming over beautiful things, I want to ride downtown on the L and go nowhere in particular.  I want to go to Canada for no reason and sit outside in the shade with quesadillas and a drink and look at buildings a hundred times my height.  I want to be taken care of.  I want to know all the answers to all the questions I ask myself.  I want to climb up on a chair and hang the sun on my wall with acrylic paint and bare fingers.  I want to roast fake hot dogs over bonfires and set off fireworks and drink pineapples and coconuts and cranberries.  I want everyone I miss to be in the same place for once.  I want to get markered mail in envelopes covered with pictures and glitter.  I want to fly kites at the Tridge.  I want to be really, genuinely interested in something a teacher says.  I want to spend a weekend watching movies and eating ice cream with my mom.  I want to wake up on Easter morning and search behind the curtains for a basket full of chocolate and toys.  I want to sit in a crowded cafeteria and sing ""I Will Survive"" at the top of my lungs with five other people and not care whether the rest look or they don't.  I want to taste strawberry Pocky for the first time again.  I want to get a roll of real four-by-six pictures developed and hang them all up on my door with Scotch tape.  I want to feel that there's a possibility of changing my life instantaneously.  I want to feel interesting without feeling like I'm trying.  I want to wake up and not have to get up.  I want to be eight hundred feet underground in a cave that knows what darkness really looks like.  I want to feed a squirrel from my hand.  I want to feel the first rush of something I've never felt before.  I want to be interested and have the nerve to show it.  I want to have someone else know exactly what I need to feel better.  I want to feel like I can accomplish anything.  I want to be proud of myself.

I suppose I am glad that all of those things have happened to me before, but I really wish I could have just one of them back right now."

"event","I just got a 62% on the midterm for my only class dealing with my major.  I almost feel like I'm going to throw up.

And I didn't expect it at all.  It's not like I didn't quite get around to studying - I looked at my notes and I thought I knew them, and then the questions on the test didn't quite match up.  I was wrong on nineteen out of fifty, and they were MULTIPLE CHOICE.

I suck.  I suck a lot.  And I have three things to study for today and tomorrow, and I just want to curl up in a ball and die, because this SUCKS.  I don't want to do anything anymore.

In a couple of hours I have to go to Spanish, the MOST boring pointless class I HAVE, where I learn NOTHING, but I'm supposed to actually do something there today and I don't want to.  It's a stupid thing and there's no point to it.  But if I don't it'll hurt my grade.  I hate grades a lot.  Grades cause people to learn all sorts of shit they don't care about and they don't leave time to be interested in anything.

Grrr.  College is starting to seem overrated.  Is is time for vacation yet?"

This weekend was, probably, the least technically productive time <I>ever</I>.  But it felt fabulous and new and all sorts of things I've been needing a little bit of.  I don't regret it.  Though I probably should be doing my homework now, at least.  I'm baaaad!"

"event","So that bastard fish of mine, that horrid white molly so inappropriately named Angel, has succeeded in killing the last of the other adult fish.  Soleil is gone.  Now all I have are Angel and Soleil's many babies, and I don't like Angel in the least.  I hope the little rat dies.  Of purely accidental causes, of course.  I'm still not cruel enough to kill a pet on purpose.

I should be choosing a topic for an informative speech, but I just can't think of anything I care about enough to tell thirty people about - or anything I care about that is universally interesting and appropriate to discuss in a classroom setting.

I haven't updated lately and I just don't know when the update page changed.  It's odd.

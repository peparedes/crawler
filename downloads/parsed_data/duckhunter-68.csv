"event","Funny that the last time I posted was 57 weeks ago when Ryne has his last surgery. He had the screws and plates taken out today. He is in recovery and we are waiting for him to wake up enough to go home. His mom wants him to stay overnight so she can get a break from her life at home like she is at the syberus I personally canth wait to get out of here. I spent enough money in this place. Oh well looks like the nurse is here to help him get up and dressed. Thank god I can head home to less drama."

"event","<font color=""#0000ff"" size=""3"">After 6 days of little or no sleep, Ryne went home today. He had his casts put on today and is doing very well. The swelling in his face is almost gone and his spirit is real good. Me and Michelle went to the park yesterday to see for ourselves. We met the Superintendant of parks that helped Ryne until the EMTs came. He said Ryne was banged up real bad when he found him. He is lucky something worse didnt happen. Me and Michelle want to thank those who were there for us during this time. </font>"

"event","Well Im beginning to believe the world is going down hill fast. Someone stole the license plate of my truck sometime during the night. I didnt notice it til mid morning and just shook my head. Normally I would have exploded but I didnt. It amazes me how little respect people have for others these days. But wait it gets better....I went to the license branch to get a replacement. The ladys says"" Did they steal the whole plate?"" I had to turn the beginning of the day into something better than it was. I gathered my quick wittedness. I said "" No they only stole the W and the 4 "" HERES YOUR SIGN. She says huh I said of course they stole it all you think they left some of it hanging there. She laughed. Good thing is that it didnt cost me but $9.00 and a couple hours of my time. I bolted the new one one real good. They will need to get on their back with a wrench to get it off. Im hoping Ill catch them in the act and Ill stomp the piss out of them.   Thanks for listening"

"event","The Light of Integrity:  The soul is dyed the color of its thoughts. Think only those things that are in line with your principles and can bear the full light of day. The content of your character is your choice. Day by day , what you choose, what you think, and what you do is who you become. Your integrity is your destiny....it is the light that guides your way. Those who preserve their integrity remain unshaken by the storms of daily life. They do not stir like leaves on a tree or follow the herd where it runs. In their mind remains the ideal attitude and conduct of living. This is not something given to them by others. It is their roots...it is a strength that exists deep within them."

"event","Its not the critic who counts, not the man that points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; who's face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly ,who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause, who, at best, knows in the end the triumph of high acheivement; and who at worst fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or death."

"event","A few guidelines to see if you qualify as a Liberal Christian:

Liberals are more offended by a Nativity scene than by the Maplethorpe art exhibit depicting Christ as a sodomizer.

They cite the Pope as a beacon of morality when he denounces war and capital punishment, but dismiss him as an out-of-touch relic when he expresses equal condemnation toward abortion and homosexuality.

They acknowledge the theory of evolution as being incendiary and inflammatory toward African-Americans, yet insist it be taught in public schools.

They agree with those who shout down speakers with whom they disagree, while patting themselves on the back for being ""tolerant"" of divergent views.

They find a moral equivalence between our troops putting naked Iraqi prisoners on dog leashes, with terrorists severing the heads of American hostages.
 
They say they support gay marriage, yet denounce any ballot initiative seeking to legalize it as divisive.

You think this country is a mess now, think of the mess it will be in if the Liberals win the next election."

Took me some time to find a picture to go along with my name but I did it. If they lose the Superbowl...Down with them and on to another picture. Anyway I'm here and ready for some good old fashion ""bashing"""

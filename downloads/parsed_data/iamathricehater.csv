"event","ok guys, in the last couple months i've been getting the impression that there are a lot of myths out there about the amazing punk rock group the ramones, people seem to think some things that just aren't true, and it saddens me deeply, so let's set the record straight shall we

myth #1- Ramone is their real last name
nope sorry to tell you guys, but not a single one of the ramones actually carried that last name, the name was actually just thrown out there by dee dee because they were in need of a name and everyone just decided to stick it on the end of their names, their actual names were as follows: douglas colvin (a.k.a dee dee ramone), christopher joseph ward (a.k.a. c.j. ramone), jeffrey hyman (a.k.a. joey ramone), john cummings (a.k.a. johnny ramone), marc bell (a.k.a. marky ramone), i can't remember richie's or tommy's off the top of my head but rest assured, their last names are not ramone

myth #2- Joey and Johnny are brothers
nope, Joey and Johnny met at the same time that they all met in Queens, Joey's brother was however really good friends with Johnny before they ever met, Johnny thought Joey was a hippy and didn't really like him

myth #3- Dee and Tommy are brothers
this one isn't really this big of a myth, i've only heard it once, but anyway, this couldn't have been true because Dee dee grew up in germany and tommy only met him after the band had started when he was their producer and they didn't have a drummer

myth #4- Some of them are related somehow
nope, none are brothers, none are cousins, or uncles or aunts or anything, sorry guys

wheww, glad we cleared that one up"

"event","i've been thinking a lot about music lately and have broken music down into a couple different spectrums

1)rock- the pop spectrum looks something like this 
(heavy)-=rap=--metal--industrial--hardcore----punk-----rock------*ska*-----pop-punk-------pop- (light)


2jazz- the jazz spectrum encompasses music that's more focused around talent rather than catchiness it is directly connected to the pop spectrum however as the two do intertwine
(jazz)--rag--big band---swing-----bluegrass----blues---rockabilly---(rock)


3)other- the rest of music, i'm not to up on, i.e. folk music, tribal music, cultural music stuff like that i won't try and classify as i do not know enough about them

the asterisks are put around where music has progressed to it's finest
the nathanation marks are put around rap because i by no means consider rap to be music, but i thought i'd put it up there anyway

anyway, that's my take on music, enjoy"

yea, today was sweet, not even sarcastic, today really was like one of the funnest days ever, first i had school, blah blah, no one cares about school, then after school me and zach did some jamming then i came home and napped for like 4 minutes then i worked, had a wayne's world-off with dave, my co-worker and tied, then me katrina, dan, and veronica all hung out, but we really did nothing, we just sat in dan's car and talked about philosophy and religion and suicide and stuff, that was great fun, because i'm a nerd, and i enjoy intellectual debate, it's fun for me..... think of like...... baseball for you normal people, i don't know, i'm a nerd, then katrina got angry and her and dan left the car and went to her car so me and veronica did some debating and then dan went to bed and we left, katrina also wanted to be home so she went to her home and me and veronica went to meijer and looked through other people's pictures, that was great fun, then we left and the funnest part of the day occured

now, i have only spun out twice in the history of me driving, and both were like the funnest things ever, it's like riding a roller coaster, only more excited and free, pretty cool huh? so veronica didn't want to put her seat-belt on so i was swerving and driving like an ass to try and get her to put it on and i ended up in some guys ditch, we did a 540, yea that's a spin and a half spin, IT WAS SO BLOODY FUN, i'm gonna go do it again tomorrow, no, i probably won't but still, it was sweet, so then the guy in the house came out, my parents came they had a chain, guy in house pulled me out, parents didn't really care, veronica's parents came to get her, cops came and did absolutely nothing, definitely not in that order, it's so nice driving a car you don't care about, i love it, oh, and i cracked the concrete for the drainage pipe under the guys driveway, that was cool, i felt powerful

glitter rawker:	sex is natural, frogs do it
glitter rawker:	are frogs sinners?
MissMeAtMidnight:	couldn't tell you, I'm not a frog
glitter rawker:	there's nothing wrong with sex, it's completely natural
glitter rawker:	how would you reproduce without it?
MissMeAtMidnight:	I wouldn't
MissMeAtMidnight:	but I am also not ready for that now.
glitter rawker:	yes you are, otherwise your body wouldn't have made it possible for you to concieve a child
MissMeAtMidnight:	physically, yes. It's possible
MissMeAtMidnight:	but no, it's not going to happen now.
glitter rawker:	it's unnatural to wait until you're 20 to have sex
MissMeAtMidnight:	why?
glitter rawker:	because your body gets craves it the minute you hit puberty
MissMeAtMidnight:	maybe for you...
glitter rawker:	that's what puberty is all about, your body is telling you to reproduce
MissMeAtMidnight:	yep.
MissMeAtMidnight:	I know that.
MissMeAtMidnight:	 I also know that it might not even be 20
MissMeAtMidnight:	it's my choice.
glitter rawker:	it's your choice, but you can also choose not to eat, but that's also unnatural
MissMeAtMidnight:	if I don't eat, I die.
MissMeAtMidnight:	if I don't have sex, I don't.
glitter rawker:	if you don't have sex the human race dies
glitter rawker:	it's the same thing
MissMeAtMidnight:	I didn't say I never would
MissMeAtMidnight:	I just said I'm not now.
MissMeAtMidnight:	and haven't you heard of over-population? 
MissMeAtMidnight:	that's what's happening in the world....
glitter rawker:	uh huh
MissMeAtMidnight:	so why bring more people into it?
glitter rawker:	that's because of modern medicine
glitter rawker:	which is also unnatural
MissMeAtMidnight:	modern medicine is unnatural?
MissMeAtMidnight:	elaborate on this...
glitter rawker:	damn straight it is, everything to do with technology is unnatural
MissMeAtMidnight:	so go live under a rock, Nate
glitter rawker:	what have we gained from technology?
glitter rawker:	a 40 hour work week and a bunch of rules that govern thousands of miles for people that don't have the same needs
MissMeAtMidnight:	the ability to stop deadly disease
MissMeAtMidnight:	MMR? you got it.... 
glitter rawker:	you need deadly disease, how else would you take care of over population?
MissMeAtMidnight:	not all of them are stopped
glitter rawker:	disease is there for a reason, it's all part of the natural order, when we destroy it we're playing god
MissMeAtMidnight:	no one plays God, but God
glitter rawker:	i beg to differ
MissMeAtMidnight:	go ahead
glitter rawker:	if there was a god then no one could play god
MissMeAtMidnight:	exactly. 
MissMeAtMidnight:	they aren't playing God
MissMeAtMidnight:	they are doing what is possible by human nature
glitter rawker:	but think about it, human nature is to go against the natural, to destroy, to consume, to decide what is right and what is wrong, god couldn't let that happen because god theoretically has a system
glitter rawker:	there is no system to human nature
glitter rawker:	we are a glitch in the natural order
MissMeAtMidnight:	ever thought that it's supposed to be that way?
MissMeAtMidnight:	what's your theory on the beginning of the world?
glitter rawker:	we're supposed to destroy?
MissMeAtMidnight:	no. we're supposed to learn.
glitter rawker:	what god would create a being meant for destruction?
glitter rawker:	the only thing we're learning is how to destroy better and in greater numbers
MissMeAtMidnight:	Nate, without destrustion, nothing would be. 
MissMeAtMidnight:	the same particles that were here when the earth was created are here now.
MissMeAtMidnight:	the same ones
MissMeAtMidnight:	the only ones.
glitter rawker:	it is true that without destruction you couldn't have creation, but there has to be a balance
MissMeAtMidnight:	yep
MissMeAtMidnight:	there does
MissMeAtMidnight:	I still want to know your opinion on the beginning of the world
MissMeAtMidnight:	big bang, god, giant meteor?
glitter rawker:	when a leopard kills an animal it eats it and then it dies and it becomes food for micro-organisms and becomes food for plants, but when a human creates toxic gases that pollute our envvironment and kill off our world permanently there is no balance
MissMeAtMidnight:	and the human world is not resetricting the amounts of pollutants it releases
MissMeAtMidnight:	so as not to kill the environment
MissMeAtMidnight:	a VERY low number of parts per million or billion of pollutants can be released
glitter rawker:	how do you explain the depletion of the ozone
MissMeAtMidnight:	before the limits were set.
MissMeAtMidnight:	they now know what's causing it. and are working to stop, or at least slow the process
glitter rawker:	it doesn't matter, the limits are just going to slow the depletion of the ozone, not stop it
MissMeAtMidnight:	just said that
MissMeAtMidnight:	yes, eventually Nate, there will be a large enough hole in the O3 layer that it will be dangerous to be outside without getting UVA and UVB rays from the sun
MissMeAtMidnight:	it happens now.
glitter rawker:	yes, how can you say that's natural
glitter rawker:	it's destruction, why would god design a creature designed to destroy itself
glitter rawker:	the only way we can fix the problem is by playing god
MissMeAtMidnight:	&quot;playing god&quot; is a really offensive statement, ya know that?
glitter rawker:	why do you say that?
MissMeAtMidnight:	because we arent play things...
glitter rawker:	by playing i mean acting
glitter rawker:	just like an actor plays a character
glitter rawker:	the only way we can keep from destroying ourselves is by reversing our natural programming which was theoretically put in there by god, which means that in order to keep from killing ourselves off we have to fix the problem god made in creating which to me, proves the inexistence of a god
glitter rawker:	or an all powerful one at least
MissMeAtMidnight:	go ahead and think that Nate...
MissMeAtMidnight:	we'll see
glitter rawker:	it's just logic, i'm not trying to deny your lifestyle, believe me i used to be just like you
MissMeAtMidnight:	what am I like? please tell me
glitter rawker:	you believe really strongly in your morals and believe very strongly in god, i can tell that pretty easily
glitter rawker:	there's nothing wrong with it
MissMeAtMidnight:	you got that right
glitter rawker:	i a lot of times wish i still had my faith, it's a great thing to have, it's just not for me that's all, i place my faith in my brain, and in my logic
MissMeAtMidnight:	that's fine
MissMeAtMidnight:	I am science minded also. I just choose a belief that works for both
glitter rawker:	science and religion can never go hand in hand
MissMeAtMidnight:	what's your belief then?  I've asked you several times.
glitter rawker:	i don't think we're supposed to know
MissMeAtMidnight:	my theory... 
glitter rawker:	i think that if we were supposed to know then it would be incontrovertible as to what you were supposed to believve
MissMeAtMidnight:	God created the universe through the way it says in the bible, but he put all of the evidence of other ways into place so there could be more than one option
glitter rawker:	theres no options in truth, there's either right or wrong
MissMeAtMidnight:	then there will always be a wrong
MissMeAtMidnight:	but it's up to people to decide what that wrong is
glitter rawker:	but if you decide that god is wrong, then supposedly you go to hell right?
MissMeAtMidnight:	yea
glitter rawker:	so why would god place evidence for you to believe other things
glitter rawker:	is god tricking us into going to hell?
glitter rawker:	that's the only thing i can think of
MissMeAtMidnight:	keep in mind, this is entirely based off of Christianity... there are other religions
glitter rawker:	but according to christianity, if you are a buddhist you'll go to hell correct?
glitter rawker:	or a muslim
glitter rawker:	or a shiite
MissMeAtMidnight:	I know what you mean
MissMeAtMidnight:	just the idea that Christianity could be wrong
MissMeAtMidnight:	Heaven and H*** may not even exist
glitter rawker:	i dont believe they do
glitter rawker:	a lot of times i really wish i did believe though, cuz if you think about it we really don't know, christianity could be 100% correct, and then i'm screwed, but if i'm right and there really is no god, then christians are still fine
MissMeAtMidnight:	you can always come back...
MissMeAtMidnight:	if you allow yourseld
MissMeAtMidnight:	yourself*
glitter rawker:	no, you can't force yourself to believe something, believe me i tried, the only way around it is brainwashing, which i believe is the only way i was a christian in the first place, and i can't allow my mind to be put in a box
glitter rawker:	you can't limit yourself to one way of thinking when there is so much that is unknown
MissMeAtMidnight:	and I agree
glitter rawker:	no matter how hard we try we will never be able to explain our existence, and i don't think we're meant to, and when you're part of a religion, you're limiting yourself to that way of thinking, you can't think about being a muslim when you're christian, it's against christianity
glitter rawker:	the purpose of religion is to explain the unknown and no religion will ever be able to explain everything we don't know
glitter rawker:	it's limiting our brain power to say that it will
MissMeAtMidnight:	I know it won't
MissMeAtMidnight:	everything will never be explained
MissMeAtMidnight:	it's impossible
glitter rawker:	i think most of the time we just don't want to think about it, so we invent ways around it, like god
MissMeAtMidnight:	very possible"

"event","dear live journal readers, 
this is the king of england, i have created a system of live journal posting for the benefit of everyone involved
step 1. Nathan makes a post, he'll keep it short, usually stupid and non-controversial
step 2. EVERYONE replies to it
by doing this we can ensure that nathan doesn't come to his computer, find that nobody has replied to any on his posts and make him jump out a 17 story window.
thank you for your time
sincerely, 
the king of england"

"event","i've decided that from now on i'm going to pick a mood at random, because for the most part my mood is more complicated than one word, 

well then now that that's said and done i think it's time to post, i've been working so much lately, today was actually my 4th day in a row of working 5-close, closing sucks too, i have to do all the work, like sweeping, mopping, dishes, it sucks, but it's ok, cuz i figured it out that my next paycheck is gonna be over 200 bucks, my last one was like 150 which is pretty cool, i felt rich for the two days that i had the money, until i had to go to court and pay off my check, so instead of having 150, i now have 60, sucks, i wanted to go binge on cds, oh well, maybe next check, oh well, oh yea, and aubrey, i'm so glad i didn't call in like i wanted to yesterday, it was the coolest day ever, some jackass guy came in and was all pissed cuz on the phone i made him check the expiration date on his coupon, cuz i guess he thought i thought he was dumb, which ya know he was, but still, then he started yelling at my boss, and my boss started yelling back, and it was the coolest thing ever, angry russian guy+yelling and swearing=fucking awesome, haha, then lisa came and visited me, which was cool, but made me mad all at the same time, cuz when she came to visit me she was on her way to visit joe, which kinda pissed me off, but it was cool to have some company anyway, 

tonight was sweet, it basically consisted of me and my brother picking the most random songs that we have downloaded and playing them as we worked on the west wall of the house, it was sweet, well, i'm tired, and i think we have drumline tomorrow (although i dont know cuz once again, i wasn't told) anyway i'm going to bed"

p.s. i had no choice AT ALL about being at practice on monday, my mom didn't have time to drive me until later then she had to go to about 4 different banks, the only thing i could've done differently was walk about 6 miles to carolyns house carrying my quads the whole way, maybe next time"

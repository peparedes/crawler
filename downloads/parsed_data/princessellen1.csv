"event","Not sleeping is fucking awesome.&nbsp; Oh wait...no it isn't.&nbsp; This is two nights in a row that I try and sleep with no success.&nbsp; I mean in the past I pull a lot of all nighters on my own choosing and I deserve it when I get sick or can't focus.&nbsp; But seriously, why can't I fucking close my eyes and fall asleep.&nbsp; I mean when you lay there for like 6 hours just praying you will at least be able to sleep for thirty minutes, you know something isn't right.&nbsp; Whatever...I'll be working on diff eq once my brain wakes up.&nbsp; Oh, I got another turtle.&nbsp; She is fucking sweet.&nbsp; Her name is Princess.&nbsp; Right now she is just chilling on the filter which is absolutely hilarious.&nbsp; These turtles are almost therapeutic to me because they give me something to take care of and be responsible for.&nbsp; Well I better get to my studies because there is nothing more exciting than doing math at 6 in the morning.

"event","<font color=""#808000"">Its time to turn things around.&nbsp; Its all about school now.&nbsp; I need to make grades and get my head on straight.&nbsp; Sometimes I am so ashamed to be me it hurts.&nbsp; I hope all my friends can support me in my road to ""recovery"".&nbsp; Its gonna be an uphill battle but I need to be the better person and work through it.&nbsp; I think other people will benefit just as much as I will if I can get back on track.&nbsp; So yeah, its sort of embarrassing that I have to admit how much or a mess I am, but thats the only way to start getting better.&nbsp; I love my friends and I look forward to being the best friend I can be to them.&nbsp; <br /><br />TIME TO BE A NERD AGAIN BITCHES!!!<br /><br />XOXO,<br />Ellen</font>"

"event","I didn't do shit all damn day.&nbsp; Wow I'm pathetic.&nbsp; And I'm tired so I'm gonna stop writing and watch the rest of the movie.&nbsp; Tomorrow will be a super productive day and I am so excited to see my friends!!!&nbsp; I smell bad cause I'm too lazy to shower today.&nbsp; But when you sit on the couch in the lounge by yourself all day its not really a big deal if you smell.&nbsp; Oh, and my friends Patrick, Joe and Eric were all piss as drunk and came to bring me a bowl for my Ravioli and an antibiotic that is really hardcore (I'm saving it for later).&nbsp; Then Patrick proceeded to piss in one of my showers on my floor.&nbsp; Now I know which shower stall to never use (The one closest to the entrance).&nbsp; And my friend Eric lost his virginity!&nbsp; Congrats to him, its about time haha jk.&nbsp; His drunk ass walks into the lounge and immediately says ""I got rid of my virginity!""&nbsp; Wow I love people.&nbsp; Oooook.&nbsp; Have a fantastic night.

P.S. I'll kill you"

"event","I wonder what it feels like,
What it feels like to be you.
Like the perfect puzzle
All the pieces of&nbsp; your life fit,
They fit without a hitch.

When I'm feeling so blue
The only one I can turn to,
The only one is you.

My faith draws me to you,
Your convictions are so real.
If only I could I could live half as true,
Half as true as what,
What I can steal from you.

When I'm feeling so blue
 The only one I can turn to,
 The only one is you."

"event","<b><font color=""#ff99cc"">So I got home from break on Friday afternoon.&nbsp; I left the house for the first time today to go to the bank because I had $88 in charges for overcharging my account.&nbsp; I'm a pimp so I made them go away.&nbsp; But no joke, I haven't even stepped outside until today for 20 minutes.&nbsp; I hate talking to my friends and hearing them having super fun breaks.&nbsp; This is why I can never ever live at home again for an extended period of time.&nbsp; My parents have no trust in me whatsoever and they treat me like I'm fucking 2.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot, I was trying on dress clothes and I one of them was a tank top and I forgot about my new tattoo on my shoulder and my mom saw it.&nbsp; Fuck...that was not good.&nbsp; She just walked out of the house and didn't come back for like 2 hours.&nbsp; For fuck's sake its my goddamn body.&nbsp; Its not like its on my face or something.&nbsp; So my dad is pretty okay about it because hes not a flaming douche bag.<br /><br />I'm coming back to IIT on Friday.&nbsp; I am fucking pumped.&nbsp; I know not a lot of people are around, but I know a few people I will hang out with.&nbsp; Hopefully we can find some fun shit to do downtown on St. Patty's Day.&nbsp; Nick, Bill, and the crew isn't coming home until Sunday so that stinks but I'm okay with it because I pretty much talked to Bill for 3 hours the other night online.<br /><br />Okay, enough of me blabbering.<br /><br />P.S. WELCOME TO MY LIFE BITCH!</font></b>"

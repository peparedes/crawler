Weakminded people who wear their hearts on their sleeve are like strings on a guitar. Sure to manipulate an individual string is easy to do and can produce some music, but manipulating many strings at once though more difficult before you master the art, creates a far more satisfactory melody.

I will play the fools of Hogwarts like they were a fine Spanish guitar and they will dance to the music I write."

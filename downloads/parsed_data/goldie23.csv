TOP TEN STORIES OF 2005

1. VT or not VT
 
The top news story of 2005 is one that dominated my thoughts over the last eight months of the year.  Upon visiting the Bucknell campus over Easter Sunday, I realized just how much I had missed academic pursuit.  Later that week, a plan was put in place to go window shopping for grad school.  Aided by the layoff, I pursued this option ever further, planning a trip to the campus and talking with several professors there.  

From then on, it was a done deal.  The question was no longer if I wanted to go back to school, but when.  After deferring the fall semester due to lack of funding, a plan was put into place to attend during the spring.  Mistakenly, I thought there would be ample grant money available.  However, it wasn't until the last day I would entertain a move to the Blacksburg area in time to start that it was finalized.  The plans that were set in motion around late April were well on their way to being accomplished at the onset of 2006.

2.  The move

As my grandfather wrote in his autobiography, there comes a time for all of us to finally go into the world and strike out on his own.  This is a process, not a milestone, and he states that it took him 2 years to complete.  For me, significant progress was made toward that process in 2005.

Moving away one carload at a time during the last week of January, I successfully found a place to relocate to that was, at the time, much closer to work.  It cut my commute time by approximately 40%, and gave me a sense of independence that must be experienced first hand to really feel.  The move was completed the first weekend of February, with most of the large objects of the apartment being transferred over via my father's truck.

3. The last summer at camp (?)

The summary of events from this story have previously been chronicled within this journal.  For 13 summers, camp had been a place for me to be recharged, to be energized spiritually.  However, due to circumstances internal and external, this rejuvenation did not occur, and left a vast void in it's place.  This empty feeling lingered for several weeks, and in some regards remains unfilled to this day.

4.  The May confessions

The two confessions that took place in the second half of May occured, publicly, less then a week apart.  The lessons learned from these incidents, cheifly that of secret sin and that no one is perfect, resonate today after several months.  This was a time of forgiveness, a time of love, and a time to reflect on just how fragile we as humans can be compared to the power of evil.

5.  Infiniti totaled

In what would be the first of four accidents of 2005, this one claimed the car I had been driving since I first got my driver license during the summer of 1998.  It was the car I learned to drive in, drove to Colorado in 2002 and to North Carolina in 2003 to witness my cousin's wedding.  However, on an ice slicked 216 just outside of Hanover, I was traveling too fast around a curve and it slammed into a telephone pole, which still stands, albeit fractured, to this day.  The car was then towed to New Oxford, and a replacement was found for it that weekend.  

6. Bucknell 64, Kansas 63

During my senior year at Bucknell, I saw them beat American University 67-62.  However, I noted that all the starters were freshmen and sophomores, and made the prediction that they would be a threat to pull an upset in 2005's NCAA tournament, and could potentially be a sweet sixteen team in 2006.  This prediction remains to be seen, but for the 2005 season, I was right on.

I remember watching the game and thinking nothing of it until about 7 minutes remained and Bucknell was leading.  That's when the idea that a Bison victory might be at hand.  As more time ticked off the clock, the more tense I became until the final buzzer with Bucknell ahead by 1.  It was a truly great team, one that performed well both on the court and off the court.

7. HADCO lay-off

It was the week after April fool's day that I noticed that production had slipped, as some people on the floor were leaving as early as 10 AM.  So it was no surprise that my supervisor, on April 8, pulled me aside and told me I was being let go.  That announcement gave me a sense of peace, considering the plans that were being set in place with regards to grad school.  It also marked the end of the worst position ever held, with my intelligence being put into question by other workers there on a near-daily basis.

8.  GSS hiring

Six weeks after being laid off by HADCO, I was hired by Gichner Shelter Systems as an engineer.  The job was a much better one, for it paid better, was a lot more laid-back, and offered more favorable work then what I had been doing previously.  When word got out about my plans for the future, many were saddened that I was leaving.  The feeling was mutual, and I have not ruled out a return to GSS in the future, even with an advanced degree.

9.  Hurricane Katrina

This story and my reaction to it has been chronicled in this journal.  My feelings remain basically unchanged- that there is plenty of blame to go around for this and to put all of it on one particular aspect (be it the questionable leadership, people taking advantage of the situation or something else) is foolish.  It doesn't look like I'll be able to help out over spring break as once thought possible, but would like to do something hands-on toward this recovery effort.

10.  Eagles compete in Super Bowl XXXIX

While they didn't win the Super Bowl, it was the end of a lot of frustration in SE PA when they finally won the Conference Championship, defeating the Atlanta Falcons to earn a spot in the Super Bowl for the first time since 1981.  They also played respectfully in the game, despite their opponents refusing to do so.  They also kept it respectful on the scoreboard, and is the only Super Bowl in history to be tied after each of the first three quarters.

2005 PERSON OF THE YEAR

This year's POY was someone who I saw face to face only once during 2005.  We went through a lot of these stories together, and carried each other's burdens throughout the year.  It is for this reason, that sharing of each other's lives, that Maggie Hlasta is this year's POY."

"event","There is so much I can type here that has happened over the past two months.  Indeed, they were two of the most pivotal in my life, for as I said before, my life would be very different with a graduate degree as opposed to not having one.

I will present what all has happened since the last entry in time-line form, hoping that would limit just how long this entry will go...

Nov. 12- Return from Blacksburg

Dec. 5-  After being told no GTA grants are available, I'm informed that a GRA (graduate research assistantship) may be available.

Dec. 6-  Professor with possible grant is contacted, and says there's a 99% chance of a grant coming through.  I tell Pete I'll be out of the apartment by year's end.  Rumor of my leaving starts to get around work.

Dec. 12- Call Professor Roan to confirm grant.  He says he can't, and to call back on the 14th.

Dec. 14- Grant still can't be finalized; should be done by the next day.  I start to prepare for the worst.

Dec. 15- I call, he's not there due to a severe ice storm that hit all Western VA.

Dec. 16- I call, no answer.  I start to panic a little bit.

Dec. 19- Finally get through to him, and am told there will be a thumbs-up-thumbs-down verdict by the 21st.

Dec. 21- No answer.  I leave a message to get back to me immediately.  The rumor then spreads to my boss and I tell him I should know for sure what I am doing by tomorrow.  By this time I am so frustrated I can't see straight by day's end.

Dec. 22- Finally get an e-mail saying there will be a grant.  I start to breath a little easier.

Dec. 22-26-  X-mas at my parents house, the first time it's been there since '96.  I saw my newest 1st cousin, Sloan Fuller, who was born about 1.5-2 years ago.  She is cute, albeit a bit loud.

Dec. 26- Move out of the apartment with the day off.

Dec. 28- Clean out apartment only to realize I had lost my social security card, car registration and proof of insurance.  My car was up for inspection that month (it had to be done even though I knew I was moving out of state since I'll still be a PA resident until the 4th of July or thereabouts).  Meanwhile, a massive apartment search commences.

Dec. 29- Car is supposed to be inspected, but the guy at the auto shop doesn't like the temporary registration I had printed out, even when it says it is legitamate for state inspections.  I also claim an apartment, a 2-bdrm place about 3-4 miles from the campus.  Problem is it might not be ready for Saturday, when I must move in.  I spit tacks for the next several hours.  Fortuneately, my family had an extra car so I drove it while it was still at the shop.

Dec. 31- The 7th annual Markle-Gold outing at ESPNZone, Baltimore.  Jacoby was fortuneate enough to come along this year.  That was the most fun I had had in a very long time.

Dec. 31-Jan 1- NYE party at the Valencia Ballroom, where me and 350 other people from all over the place swung in the new year.  I had to walk several city blocks wearing a blue zoot suit.  The looks I was getting were... priceless...

Jan. 1-  Said good-bye to church at Glen Rock.  I attended both services and cried both times.  It was very hard to say good-bye to them, with me being there for half my life.  I was not looking forward to doing that for a long time.  That night, there was a going away party for me at the Yeildings.  It was a very nice gesture on their part, and will remember that for a long time.

Jan. 5-  I finally get word that the apartment will be good to go for Saturday.  Problem is, no electricity.  I call up the local electric company and tell them to turn it on immediately.  They say they probabaly can, but might have to wait until Monday if they can't do it Friday.

Jan. 6-  I say good-bye to Gichner, and that was difficult to do.  It was a much better place to work at then HADCO, for they let me be me and loved me for it.  I haven't slammed the door on returning there someday, which I easily could do (if they are hiring at the time of course.)  After work, I picked up a moving van and started to get everything from my parent's garage into the truck.  Dad and Randy Robertson help out.  Went dancing that night, said good-bye to everyone there.

Jan. 7-  Moving day.  Mom and Adam are in the Saab, I'm driving my car and dad is in the truck.  We arrive at about 2:15 PM.  We unload the van, and both cars and eat at El Rodeo.  They then left for home.  I started to get settled in while listening to the playoffs on the radio.  I got the games on WFAN, which is in New York, some 600 miles away...

which brings me to...

January 8-  I got up, went to church and ate out with some of the older college students who live in the area.  It was nice, and it shows me they are willing to take me in, even if I do talk funny (more on that later).  I finished moving things around here, and it is set up very nicely I might say.  The apartment is two bedrooms, so I set one up as my bedroom (this bedroom has has an huge closet) and the second as a study, where my computer, books, and my second bed are located.  The living room isn't too big, but it isn't too small either and with little trouble was able to get everything to fit.  The kitchen is small, but I'm willing to live with that for a DISHWASHER!!!  The least favorite thing to do when you're living by yourself... gone!  This place also has free Wi-fi service, which I'm currently using.  All for $500 a month.  Not bad for moving in site unseen.  After PM services, I went to BK with the campus minister and ate dinner with his family.  They are very nice, and look forward to learning from/working with them.  I finished putting my clothes away once I got home and am now done ""settling in"".

So there you have it, two months in I don't know how many words.  It was a bit gut-wrenching at times, but the dust seems to have settled.  However, there are a few things that I've got to adjust to...

1.  Beer/wine at gas stations (this seems a bit dangerous, don't you think?)
2.  Sweet tea is iced tea, and iced tea is unsweetened tea.
3.  I'm the one with the funny accent (the ""twang"" here is more pronounced as I thought it was going to be)
4.  The south appearently won the civil war.
5.  It was about 50 degrees and the natives were complaining about ""how cold it was"".

That's all for now.

"event","VT might not any grants, making the exercise in putting life on hold for the past half-year potentially futile.  Work has become frustrating, and all these accidents isn't helping matters at all.  

I did make it to Blacksburg for the weekend, where I was informed there probably aren't any research grants for the upcoming semester.  I've had to accept a grim reality today- that there might not be a grant, and that it would be impossible to go to school there.  I'm so sick of having my life being put on hold it's unreal, in case you haven't picked it up by what's been written in here.  Six months is too long, and another eight months would be unacceptable.  There's still hope, but given my luck in the past FUHGEDDABOUDDIT.

My stay in Blacksburg was an enjoyable one, though.  It further cemented my desire to be there full time.  I got to know the group there a little better, and that's always a plus.  I managed to go from there to here in just over 5 hours, and didn't have to stop once for anything.

I just want my life to move on.  For too long now, it's been in limbo, and I hate uncertainty.  I've been sorely lacking in certainties since graduating.  Is it too much to ask to know where I'm going to be in a few weeks?"

"event","Another day, another accident!!!! OH BOOOOOOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was pulling into the parking lot at work, behind someone who was going in for a job interview.  She came to a stop, so I stopped about a car length behind her.  I figured she was going to back in to a parking spot on the right side of the lot, so I wasn't surprised to see her put her car in reverse.  But instead of doing that, she backed right into me despite me blowing the horn...

Powerhouse this past weekend was simply awesome.  There were several camp rats there, including some I hadn't seen in years.  It was very good to see them, and it was very good to be with them in a celebration to God.  It was a huge gathering, with some 600 people total.  Three members of our church were baptized this weekend, which is always a good thing.

While in Fairfax, VT lost!!!!  AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  I didn't get to watch any of the game, but it sounded painful.  PSU manhandled WI, and now stands only a win at Mich. State away from the conference title and likely Fiesta Bowl birth.  But wait there's more!!!

PSU can make it to the Rose Bowl this year.  It probably won't, but crazier things can happen.

-Texas has to lose, and with a road rivalry game at Texas A&M to close out the year, and a conference title game to go, it could happen (See OU of a few years ago)

-Miami has to stub its toe, either against Ga Tech or in the ACC title game.

-Alabama has to run through LSU, at Auburn and SEC E champion.  I don't think they are that good.

-They are ahead of LSU, but another Tiger loss can't hurt.  It'll help them in the polls to help them stay ahead of other 1-loss teams.

-Duh, PSU has to win, and win convincely at MSU (11/19)

VT and PSU could also play each other, but the odds of that are mathmatically insignificant, as the above has to happen and USC has to lose somehow, and get lots of help from the pollsters.  If PSU would have beat Michigan, they'd probably only have to have TX/USC lose somehow.

Remember what I wrote about gas prices about 2 months ago?  Man, I love being right... if it wasn't for Rita they'd be around $2/gal right now.

Flyers won tonite in OT to run their record to 9-4.  They haven't played as many games as some of the other teams, but they are close to the top of the division anyway.

YS has qualified for districts playoffs with a 9-1 record.  They go to Muhlenburg (Berks County) to play the #3 seed.  A win would probably set up a re-match with Susquehannock in round 2.

I wrote a rather lengthy letter to the youth minister at Glen Rock after getting home on Sunday.  I covered pretty much everything, from the decline of my parent's involvement with the church to perhaps having to give up camp to being single and of course the impending move.  Which reminds me I've got some e-mails to type up toward that effort.  I talked with Ken after work today, and it was nice to touch base with him and talk about our lives.  I called mom and she admitted that her spiritual life isn't where it needs to be, and is looking for ways to bring it to where she wants it to be.  It's nice to hear that from her, as she has done more to influence my faith then anyone has."

I sent out feeler letters to some Blacksburg apartments today, and there are about 10 or so apartments I am interested in.  There is also the possibily of moving into an apartment just outside of town, which would make getting there a bit of a chore, esp. if I wanted to ride a bike everywhere.  We'll see...

Powerhouse starts tomorrow, and I managed to work the necessary extra time, just short of 2 hours, to get out on time for that.  I don't know what to expect, by all accounts it's the youth rally to end all youth rallies, which may explain why they do it only once every other year.  I was still in school for the last one, and had no way of knowing what was going on.

I've noticed that a good chunck of my clothing has gone missing.  I suspect that it's at my parent's house, which I would be at for another two weeks, but if it isn't there, I don't know where it would be.  It's not in my room, not in the other room, not in the car, and it's not at work.  The goblins must have taken it."

I forgot to mention a few things in the last post.  One was that the car was fixed, and looks as good as ever.  The shop down here has done two outstanding jobs on it, and it looks better now then when I bought it.

Work continues to be just that, work.  I'm ""chopping wood"" as I've been calling it in anticipation of bigger things in the near future.  I've been doing a lot of data organization there, as there is a big push for standardization that would help reduce the amount of time it takes for us to get our designs across.  It's not something I'd want to be doing long term, but for here and now, it's OK.  I've managed to get the 14th off, and with no better explaination of a personal day.  Still no idea what's up, although some hints may soon be dropped as to what I'm doing (esp. if a grant comes through this month)

Monday was Halloween, and no one stopped by my door.  I bought two bags of candy, so I've been chopping on them (as well as a lot of candy at work) and have had enough sugar this week to sink a battleship.  At work, people were dressing up, so I decided to let them see the Cletus teeth (Bucknellians will know what they are...)  and hid them from my boss most of the day, until he asked why I didn't dress up.  After he said that I turned my head, popped them back in there and he laughed...

I've been flexing time this week so I can get out early on Friday to go to Powerhouse in Fairfax, VA.  It'll be nice to get out when the sun is out, which is something I can't do because of the time shift.  This means I won't be able to see the biggest PSU game of the past 7 years or so (yes, bigger then this year's OSU game) against WI.  Oh well, I have faith they'll pull it off."

"event","As advertised, I went to the PSU game by myself on Saturday.  It was a very good time, as it always is.  I paid $65 for the ticket, which was cheap for this game.  Yes, it was Purdue, but it was homecoming and tickets for that game were tough to come by.  109,467 was the paid attendence, but the row I was sitting in was practically empty except for me.  The game itself went pretty much according to the script, PSU wins 33-15.

VT continues to make a case to be in the championship game with another business-like win over #13 Boston College on Thursday.  Texas had some trouble, but took care of Oklahoma State.  The rest of Texas' schedule is weak, so any loss would drop them below VT handily (and probably below PSU as well).

Sunday was interesting, I taught the adult class at church on marriage of all things.  While I was preparing for it, dad brought to my attention that he had taped one of Lon Mohondro's sermons while he still preached at Sunbury (He's now at Tabernacle, see June 12 entry or thereabouts) in March of 1987.  It practically said all I wanted to say, and so it was played then later discussed for that class.  Many adults commented that the tape should be seen by our youth group, something I totally agree with.

I can count the number of passing times I'll be at on one hand, and it appears as though those around me are starting to take notice to that fact (well, except for those at work, they still have no idea what I'm up to).  Yesterday's was emotional, for we sang quite a bit in the dark and the kids really enjoy that.

Saw YS vs. Susquehannock in a footb- I mean mud wrestling match in pads on Saturday.  The game was scoreless at the end of regulation in large part because the field was a gigantic mud pit.  The Warriors got the ball second in OT (they do the exact same thing as college, only the ball is started at the 10 instead of the 25) and after YS score a FG with their possession, Susquehannock ran it in on second down to win the ""game"".  But it was still a blast despite my alma matter losing and the not-good weather (a cold drizzle).  They are still 7-1 and will win this weekend before playing Twin Valley (I have no idea how good they are) to close out the year.  At least I know how the game was played in the 30s after watching that.

After watching that game, I came home and watched Ala-Tenn.  That game also ended 6-3.  To remind myself what offense looked like, I saw the PSU game and they were up on Illinios 56-3 at the half.

The VT rug continues to come together.  It is now 3/4 done.  I'm hoping to have it finished before Fairfax (week and a half from now).

And now, something from the total absurdities department. (no, not just a CHI-HOU world series...)  The mother of the driver who hit my car some 2+ weeks ago told her insurance agency that I was the one who was out of control.  Upon hearing this from Allstate, I thanked the agent for telling me that because I always enjoy a good laugh.  I've already explained the accident, so I wouldn't here and will be very mad if I pay any of the repairs on that car.  It's on now......."

This past weekend was a good one, spent it at camp with our youth groups.  It was a change of pace for me, for I'm used to hanging around the older kids.  This weekend a lot of younger kids were there, with the older ones busy with work or other things.  I managed to win the fussball tournament for a third time, having won in '99, '03 and now in '05.  It didn't come easy though, as Olivia of all people gave me a run for my money in the first game, and at one point I was behind 5-2.  But that soon passed, and proceded to score 8 of the next 10 to quell the massive upset threat.  I faced Adam in the final, and won 10-8.  It's the third time we've faced each other in the finals, and I now lead that series 2-1.

Because I was at camp, I didn't get to see PSU lose for the first time this year.  I hear it was a very close, controversial game, but PSU should've stopped them on the last play of the game if they wanted to stay in the national championship hunt.  They are still in the conference driver's seat, but would need to win at Mich. State to close the year (and win the other three games) to win their first conference title since '94.  Oh well, they are back, and that is what is important.  We've waited too long for PSU to return to glory.  VT plays MD on Thursday and did not play this weekend.  They remain thrid in the nation.

Mom and dad are in CA for this week, and am here dog/housesitting with Jeff for the week.  Jeff is here for the time being, until he gets some $ from his new job and finds a place of his own.  Jeff is my mom's brother, for those outside the loop.

Just got done reading an article about John Wooden on espn.com.  It is highly recommended reading, and has been someone I have admired for a very long time.  His devotion to his friends, family, God and his humility have been outstanding even now as he starts the 96th year of his life.  If everyone would to live life by his principles, this world would be a much better place to live.

There was a blood drive at work today, so I gave a pint this morning.  I didn't pass out this time as I did the first time I gave blood, which is always a plus.  It has left me feeling a bit tired, as can be expected.

Susquehannock and YS both won, and both will be 7-0 when they play at YS this Saturday.  It promises to be a great game, although most prudents say Susq. has an edge.  We shall see.

Not much else to report.  It's been quiet, which is fine by me.  The VT rug is coming along, and is now more then half done.  I should have it done by the time I visit the campus mid-November.  The dog needs some attention..."

But oh, what a game I missed!  It was an old-school, line-'em-up, knock-'em-down scrum.  PSU won because they didn't turn the ball over, and took advantage of OSU's.  PSU is now eighth in the nation, and have the driver's seat to the Big Ten title.  A win at Michigan Saturday all but assures them a New Year's day berth, and would give them a virtual lock on the conference title (assuming they can beat Wisconsin and OSU beats Michigan St this week).  I'll be going to the Purdue game on the 29th, come no matter what.  It'll be the last time I could go there until I move.  Speaking of, VT continued their business-like approach to their season, easily dispensing of Marshall.  They continue to be ranked third, and will continue to be there unless Texas or USC losses.

The universe had to balance things out, so the Eagles (and my fantasy team) got routed, and the Braves got KO'd from the playoffs in 4 (you heard it here first!).  But the sports gods heard my lament, and evened things out once again by making everybody's second-favorite team advance in the playoffs.  That team being, of course, whoever is playing the Yankees.  Another season with a Yankee-free World Championship.  Maybe there is some good in the world.

In other news, the spiritual gift seminar was this weekend.  That was simply awesome, and watching everyone realize what their gifts were was special.  In no surprise, I was very strong in teaching, serving and administration.  Sheparding and missionary also was high.  The only one I had a negative score was prophecy, while evangelising and mercy giving were just a little above break even.  This is very encouraging, giving my future plans.  I'm going to grad school in the hopes of being able to teach, and engineers tend to be good administrators.  The serving comes into play during the summer, where I hope to be at camp for a large chunk of the summer.  Every summer like '04, minus the job search?  I can live with that.  

But there are some things about that, which if you look at it, are unusual.  Teachers tend to be speakers, servants doers.  Teachers are objective, servants are subjective.  Admins are in the middle.  As anyone knows who has known me for a little while, I'm a bleeding-heart idealist and empathizer, and these are typically traits of mercy givers and prophets.  I think that's why sheparding was as high as it was, whereas prophecy wasn't- they like confrontation and I shy away from it at pretty much every oppourtunity.

The car was estimated twice this morning, once by the body shop I had it fixed earlier, and another time by Allstate who stopped by work.  The shop's was $3566, while Allstate's was $3160 or thereabouts.  The difference was new parts vs. recycled.  I'm hoping they can start on it next week, but we'll see.  There's some talking that needs done as you can see.

That's about it for now.  Happy birthday to sis, who turns 21 on Tuesday."

"event","Coming home from work today I was involved in the third accident I've been in 9 months.  A teen driver was taking a curve a bit too fast on Rt 216 (just off the apartment for you non York Countians) and lost control of the vehicle.  It was (and still is) raining heavily.  When I first saw the car it was going sideways right at me about 200 yards in front of me.  Not a good sight to see.  I noticed that the car was starting to drift into my lane, so when the car was 20-30 yards in front of me I got over into the other lane.  That seems to have spared an injury crash.  Instead, the back of her car hit the back right side of mine, shattering her winshield and denting the quarterpanel and taking out the tailight on that side of the car.  Everyone was OK, thankfully.  The fire company was alert immediately, as was the police and an ambulance to ensure all were OK.  The car is still driveable, albeit illegally.  

This is the sixth close call or worse I've had since last August.  Enough is enough already!"

As first reported here, the Braves commenced their annual death march in October by losing today.  Sunrise, sunset.  I'll give them game 2, but three and four will go to Houston and the Braves are 4 and out again this year.  

Rumor has it that a seat for the PSU game is running as high as $125.  That's a bit high, and I think there's a $50-60 ticket out there.  I paid $50 for the Nebraska game in '02, and that was by far the best $50 I've ever spent.  ESPN will also be doing College Gameday there on Saturday, marking the first time that's happened in several years.

Nothing else of note happened this day, like most days around here.  I had my chair die on me here at the computer, and have replaced it with yet another lawn chair.  Those Bucknellians of you know that's how I like to sit by a computer, in a lawn chair, as I am currently.

"event","Well, three months and a couple days, but who's counting?

It was a quiet week last week, I couldn't get in touch with my BU friends, but I made the trip up there anyway.  Dad and I saw grandma at her home and helped ready her old house for sale, which should happen by month's end.  I did manage to see the 'Sharks for one last time, and ended up playing a point in blue jeans.  Thankfully the disc never turned, and my guy was never thrown to, so I escaped with very minimal effort.

I've been working on the VT rug like a fiend and now have about 11000 stitches out of 47000 done.  This'll be the last rug with the 20 yard roll I ordered back in '02 (the Broncos rug I made for Andrew was the first), and ordered another 20 yards of canvas today at work.  It'll be here before that rug is completed.  I've now hooked close to 1,375,000 stitches lifetime, or about 55 miles.

I played flag football again on Sunday, and thankfully wasn't nearly as sore as I was the week before, where I almost couldn't walk Monday or Tuesday.  I did manage to hurt my thumb going after someone's flag, but that didn't stop me from intercepting a pass late or tipping the pass that was then intercepted that sealed our victory.  It's my right thumb, so ordinary things like starting my car have become rather difficult.

Hockey season starts tomorrow.  While most will say big deal, I don't.  Those who read this know how big I am into sports, and hockey is no exception.  I look forward to this year, and the Flyers are the Vegas favorites to win it all with 5-1 odds.

Speaking of teams that choke in the playoffs, the Braves start their playoff dive tomorrow.  I don't think it'll come back to Atlanta for game 5.

I need to throw in a basketball comment to round things out.  Bucknell 67, Duke 65.*  You heard it here first!

* Score only valid if Redick, Williams and the entire Duke starting lineup come down with smallpox or some other gold-rush era disease.  

The football season is progressing very nicely, with Bucknell's team being the exception.  York Suburban, VT, PSU, the Eagles and the diggers have a combined record of 22-1.  PSU gets a stern test this Saturday when Ohio State comes to town.  I know several OSU fans and am really sick and tired of them giving me the business after they win by the slimmest of margins the past several years.  Hopefully that'll change this year.  I might sneak up to that game, but it'll be 1) a traffic nightmare, 2) an expensive ticket, 3) close as to whether or not I'll make it there in time since the conference at church isn't expected to end until about 3:30.  The game starts at 7:45, so I'll probably be OK, but yikes if traffic is bad (which it obviously will be).  I'd also be getting back home stupidly late, as in 2-3 AM.  There might be a way around that though....  but oh, would it be fun!!!!

I end this entry on a sad note.  My roommate my senior year had his father die on Tuesday of congestive heart failure.  He was 59.  I spoke with Chris tonight and says that he and his family are doing OK, but they are in need of obvious prayer."

"event","It's been a quiet few days, which is OK I suppose.  I finished off the Rangers rug, so that's ready to go.  The VT rug has been started and about 3% of it is now done.  

Yesterday the paddling trip was cancelled due to lack of water.  It's been dry 'round here of late, so it wasn't surprising to hear that.  That meant I got to see two different types of football games.  One was a nailbitter, the PSU-Northwestern game, which PSU pulled out in the last minute.  It was the best game PSU won in many years.  They are now 4-0, with a ranked Minnesota team coming to Happy Valley next week.  The second game was a statement game as VT blew away Ga Tech 51-7.  It was a tour de force by the Hokies, and it was one of the most one-sided games I've seen.  They too are now 4-0, and for the moment are #3 in the nation behind USC and Texas.

After church today, the youth group went to Ken's house to play some flag football.  We had a good turn out, we were playing 10 on 11 for a time.  I was on the team with ten, but it didn't matter.  We killed them.  I was on the line most of the time on offense, but did manage to score twice, once on O and once on D.  The offensive score was sweet.  I made a double move and ran a post down the middle of the field.  Markle threw a strike and the only question that had to be asked was what kind of struting I was going to do heading to the house.  Defensively, there was an interception, but the ball got stripped about 10 yards outside the end zone.  So I picked it up and ran it the rest of the way in.  It reminded me of those BK commercials, and I would be the king, seemingly coming out of nowhere to score...

Fantasy team, thanks in large part to a huge day by Westbrook, Holt and McNabb, appear to be on the way to 2-0.  I'm up 59 with the other team still having Barber and Lelie out left to play.  Barber isn't dong too much, so it seems safe.  It'll be particularly sweet since the other owner was trash-talking all week.  Not sure why, I did outscore him by more then 70 last week even though he won.  It's always fun to shut them up.

Still not sure if dad will be joining me to go to homecoming next week or not.  If he is, I go with him.  If not, I'll try to flex during this upcoming week and get up north to talk with some of the professors and maybe take a practice with the frisbee team.  And I'll be all sore again, and then be all sore again when I play more flag next Sunday.  GOLD FOR HEISMAN!!!!

While I'm on sports, Bucknell will be playing at Duke 1/2/06, setting up the oppourtunity for them to be playing two top-5 teams in one year (Villanova at BU being the other.)  The Bulls may be heading to that game, and if they are I might join them.  I have that day off for New Years.  It'll be a blowout in all likelihood, but it'll be fun to go down there and get grilled by the Cameron crazies. 

I e-mailed the recruiter for the graduate program at VT and she said I might not hear back about a grant until after Thanksgiving.  That's a little too close for comfort, seeing how I'd have to be moving weeks later.  Hopefully I can find something a little earlier than that."

Work continues to be work.  There's whispers that I might get laid off in December or thereabouts, but those don't worry me one little bit given the situation.  I would probably be looking to find a short-term, not necessarily well paying job (thanks to the car loan being dead I can do stuff like that) for that time period.  The current plan is to, as you might expect, keep working until the first week of January before making the move to VA.  

Speaking of, I haven't heard anything from them about next semester.  This is somewhat expected, and I'm probably not going to be hearing back from anyone for another 3-6 weeks.  Although I am starting to get at least a little antsy about it, it's not a major concern at this time.

My sleep cycle was waaaaayyyyyyyy out of whack last week, causing me to stay up as late as 2 AM some nights.  That seems to have lifted somewhat, but that prolonged period of inadequate sleep touched off the worst cold I have in many years.  I typically get one around November, but this was two months early.  Alergies may also be a factor, even though I haven't had them anywhere near this bad ever.

Charles Dyer, a friend to myself as well as many others died last week; he was 81.  He was suffering through many health problems during the last year of his life.  A truly inspirational man, Charles was faithful to the end, as the youth group would come over to his house and conduct a mini-service there.  I gave the last communion thought that he would ever hear.  While I am saddened by his loss, I realize that he is no longer suffering and am joyful of where he is now.

I've restarted hooking after this summer's events put it in a three-month hiatus.  I'm am finishing off a Texas Rangers rug, but don't have anyone to give it to.  If you are, or know someone who would want it, by all means let me know immediately.  It'll go for $25 plus shipping.  The next rug, as you might expect, will be a VT rug.  It'll be my 50th.  It'll be done right around Thanksgiving/early December.

Fantasy team didn't do very well the first week, and would have lost... but since we switched over to Yahoo it didn't count.  So the first week of the season, aided by McNabb's 5 TDs, another 5 TDs from my WRs (including one from LJ Smith), and the Bears defense, the team got the second-highest score by a team in one week in the history of the league (now in it's fourth year).  I still say Simoneau should be available to pick up as a kicker.  I don't think they'll be putting up 170 points a week, but 110 isn't a stretch... given they all stay healthy (BIG if).

It appears every weekend from here until moving day has been accounted for.  Here they are...

Sept 24- Paddling trip with church
Oct 1-  BU homecoming
Oct 8-  Spiritual gifts seminar 
Oct 14-6-  Youth group retreat (although I have no idea how many are going- this was supposed to be last weekend but got postponed due to the funeral for Charles on Saturday)
Oct 22- Susquehannock at YS- These two teams may be undefeated going into this game... YS is my alma matter and Susq. is the district I currently reside.  Should be a great game
Oct 29- Going to PSU football game
Nov 4-6- Powerhouse in Fairfax, VA
Nov 12- Trip to VT to scout apartments/speak with faculty/get to know Blacksburg better.  I'll probably be using a personal day in here to lengthen the stay.
Nov 19- Hymn sing at camp; last time I'll be there for a while (maybe)
Nov 26- Thanksgiving weekend
December weekends- There's going to be a Christmas party in there somewhere, with the other two going to see a Flyers/Sixers game.  The last two are holiday weekends.
January 7- move


So there you have it.  That should keep me occupied right up until the end.  It's nice to have something to look forward to like this at the end of every week to help pass the time, which has been exceeding difficult at times, esp. during the week.  But this weekend looks fun, with the paddling trip and flag football.  I actually get that two weekends in a row it looks like.  Looks like it's time for B Gold to live up to the character he is on Madden '05... well, at least the game I have..."

"event","I'll say my piece here, and then leave it alone.

Believe you me, this is a topic on everyone's mind in here... we've all been impacted one way or another. Be it through gas gouging (I'm seeing it first hand 'round here) or something far worse- losing a loved one or fearing that, it's been a trying time for everyone.

A read a column that echoed my sediments on the whole thing. ""9/11 seemed to bring out the best of America, and Katrina seems to be bringing out the worst."" (Bill Simmons) I remember vividly the national response to 9/11... one of resolve, unity, determination to move forward. That was what America was supposed to be about- when there is a major tradegy, we all pull together, regardless of color, class, religion, political ideology, etc. I remember feeling downright scared for the next 2-3 days after 9/11, but felt comforted and proud of America for rallying around NY and Washington in their time of need.

But Katrina is different. Instead of rallying around the victims, America seems to want to take advantage of it. I've already touched on the gang situation in New Orleans, and while it has calmed down substantially, it was way too bad for way too long. It curdles my blood to think that there will be those who are and will be left unaccounted for (while on this earth at least) for their actions. Gas prices, while they rightfully went up due to simple economics, have been set too high by some who are trying to take advantage of the situation. Politicians are too busy pointing fingers at each other instead of addressing the needs of their people. 

For my part, I will be cutting a substantial check to the recovery effort and praying about it often. I toyed with the idea of going down there, but realized I'd be better off working and giving some of that earned money to the relief efforts. Long term, it could be a spring break project if the efforts are still needed then. 

This is something that has been at the forefront of my mind, and because of what I listed above, caused this bleeding-heart idealist to be very concerned about the barometer of the nation as a whole. Four years ago we were all too willing to push aside our own interests for the good of the whole, but now we are too greedy and are looking for ways to profit from this and oh well to the greater good. That's why I haven't been dwelling on it- it's symptomatic of an (gulp) evil society."

Anessa and Gregg also came with us, and it was great seeing some people at church on Sunday who I hadn't seen in close to a year.  

I've been spending a good chunck of time recently developing a fantasy football calculator that would automatically calculate winning odds of any two teams if they played each other, and what the odds would be of winning 14 games, 13 games, etc. given my scores and the scores of everyone else in the league.  There appears to be an early strong favorite, and I am the second favorite.  It's so early, however, that this is almost a wild guess as to what may happen during the year.  Only thing is I've now found out that's it's rather large (21.5 MBs).  So getting to my box back home will be a challenge.

In other news, PSU won unspectacularly.  But I remember they started the '02 season like that and they ended up fine.  VT barely won over a much better opponent on the road.  They too will be fine, since their QB is inexperienced and figures to get better as time moves along.

"event","Alright... time to get some things off my chest.  Summer is now in the rear-view mirror, so I'm going to look back at it, with much of it chronicled within this journal.

This summer was an eventful one.  I always consider the Sr High retreat as the start of the summer, so I'll go from there.

It began with myself out of a job, yet feeling God's peace like I had never truly felt before.  There was a sence of direction through it all, and when I found work whatever fears were around were quickly dashed.  The job is very much closer to what I wanted to do outside of school, the atmosphere is much more laid-back and, oh, yeah... a 15% pay raise is always appriciated :-)

Then it seemed like time stood still for the next several weeks.  The events of the second half of May (see previous) were nothing like I've experienced, but yet there were some very important lessons learned.  I've said my piece already, so I'll move on.

Those events gave way to camp-craziness, and for the first time ever, it didn't fill me up for the year.  Instead, it left me all the more shaken, and very few (outside of those who were with the GR congregation) seemed to notice or take what I was saying (this could be it) very seriously.

After that disappointment, I started to focus on what lies ahead for me.  In the not-so-distant future, I'm heading off to grad school.  While I didn't get the grant to start immediately, I am very much looking forward to what is next.  I don't know what (or with whom) it may be, but it's got to be better then the months that have just ended.  Disappointment, at times lonliness, and enough things have happened to make the idealist in me scream several times were rampant.  Things have started to settle down here recently though.  That is except for...

the hurricane.  It is unbelievable what has happened to New Orleans.  Downright scary.  It has literally transformed that area into a third or fourth-world nation.  I don't know what to make of this, I really don't.  I have heard stories of gangs shooting at victims who haven't had food or water since the storm hit, and taking hospitals (!) hostage when they have no power, supplies water, etc.  Whatever fate awaits them will be too good for them.  Their acts, and I'm not exaggerating when I say this, may be the most evil acts committed in America in the past century.  It curdles my blood to think that some will be getting away with this (well, so long as they are on Earth...) without anything happening to them.

Needless to say, help the victims anyway you can.  They need a lot more then you or I can imagine.  

This situation, while some 1600 miles away give or take, has me in a funk.  I'm finding it hard to believe there's people out there in good moods despite this, but I don't hold it against them.  I'm funny like that I suppose.  

There is a little (or, insignificant) part of it that does hit home, and that is gas prices.  I filled up on Sunday night, realizing that prices where about to go up, at $2.53 a gallon.  It was unchanged Monday, went to $2.59 on Tuesday, then $2.89 yesterday, $2.95 this morning and $3.09 this afternoon.  In Dallastown it was up to $3.19.  Ridiculous.  However, I don't think these prices will be around for too long.  It'll be this high, if not around $3.30, through Labor Day.  After that, the end of the driving season combined with the increased capacity from the storm will bring the price back to Jupiter instead of Neptune (meaning it past the moon a long time ago).  It'll be around $2.50 again, eh, mid-October.  Still way too high, but I do see it being lower then that most of the winter.  I can only hope but to be optomistic.  And before you say what can you do about it, I think I'm doing plenty.  Short-term get a good-gas car, long-term learn how to make better engines (read: grad school) and then teach others how to design better ones.  Next question!

So there you have it.  4 months in one entry.  Eat it up, spit it out, and it wasn't a very good one to be honest.  This, like the past two years or so, will be remember more for what went bad rather then what went good.  

My thoughts are prayers are with those who have lost so much in LA, MS.  May they be comforted in their hour of need."

"event","So this is what being 24 feels like... not much different.  Hither and yawn.

My birthday went pretty much according to plan.  Dad took mom and I out for dinner at Victor (a fairly nice Italian restaurant not far from the house) and went dancing afterwards.  Not too many people were there, a result of college kids going back to school and possibly late-minute summer vacations.  It wasn't hot in there like weeks past, and come out wearing the same shirt as I did coming in.  That hasn't happened in a while...

Today was the fantasy draft.  Here's how it went down:

First round:  McNabb.  He's been my horse for three years.  I'm not going to stop now, not after what he did the previous night.

Second round:  Torry Holt.  Probably the most consistent WR in the game right now.

Third round:  Javon Walker.  Farve is going to be throwing quite a bit.  Walker's his #1 WR.

Fourth round:  Brian Westbrook.  Not exactly the guy I want to be my #1 RB, but I'm willing to live with it for the top three.  Any RB below him and I would have been in trouble.

Fifth Round:  Lavernueas Coles.  He's a #1 WR back in a familiar setting, without Moss or Cherbet to steal his touches.  

Sixth Round:  Fred Taylor.  A bit of a gamble, but he was the best RB available at that time.

Seventh Round:  Mike Anderson.  He's going to be starting in Denver.  This could be the steal of the draft or Bell will be replacing him after 3 weeks.

Eighth round:  David Akers.  Kicker for a good offense, but not good enough to not get FG tries.

Ninth round:  Santana Moss.  Sure, he's not in a passing offense, but Ramsey isn't the worst starting QB, and he's a #1 WR.

Tenth round:  LJ Smith.  With Chad Lewis gone, he's going to get all the touches at TE in an offense that uses the TE.  Could have a break-out year.  Also completes an Eagles passing TD play.

Eleventh round:  Steve McNair.  Very solid back-up QB.  Insurance policy in case McNabb gets hurt.

Twelveth round:  Travis Henry.  Will probably split time with Brown to start.  This late, with three RBs already taken, this is a good gamble.

Thirteenth round:  Bears Defense.  All the ""big name"" defenses were already taken, but these guys might surpise.

Fourteenth round:  Jabar Gaffney.  A good #2 WR in an OK offense.  I'd hate to have him start consistantly, but I don't see that happening.

Fifteenth round:  Dolphins Defense.  See Bears comment, these two are very similar.  Put these defenses with the Colts Offense and they'd be a hands-down super bowl favorite.

Add it up, spit it out, I think this team is formidable.  It has a good QB, K, and TE, shaky but possibly OK RBs, and the best WR corps in the league.  The defenses were the subject of much joking, but they are the top two defenses according to foxsports, so waiting until the 13th might pay off.  I got some steals, while I don't think I reached too much here (experts will say McNabb, but with passing TDs counting for 6 pts instead of 4 I think that's OK).  If the RBs stay healthy (big if) there's no telling how far they'll go.

That's pretty much it.  The be-all, end-all is coming, I promise.  Not this is long enough, so, you're just going to have to wait."

It's been cooler around here, it looks like the weather might have turned into late summer instead of blistering hot.  Nights are a lot better, what with no AC in here.

The fantasy draft is upcoming on Saturday.  My record in the league is a steller 30-11, not including playoffs.  Including playoffs, 33-12, having won the title in '03.  The only championship my teams have won in close to ten years.  Sheesh.

As reported for the first time here in this journal, I will be 24 on Friday.  This marks the end of summer, and there will be a be-all, end-all post to finish out the summer."

"event","The first week I worked at Gichners was pretty boring to tell the truth.  Some people would love weeks like that where you're not doing much and getting paid for it anyway, but I don't.  I've learned that if you're not doing anything you're going to be out of a job before too long.  Obviously, with the plans I've got ahead of me, that wouldn't be the end of the world, but it sure has been nice to get those paychecks every week.  Starting next month, I'll be saving about 40 cents of every dollar I earn.

Went dancing last night, but really wasn't feeling up to it.  The week was a long one.  I left around 11, which the earliest I've left there in a while.

I got a letter in the mail recently about the car accident.  It appears the guy who hit me was uninsured at the time of the accident, and could be facing jail time for not having insurance.  Meanwhile, it appears that I'll be short $500 because of this.  Less then 10% of all cases like this are solved with the deductible being refunded.  The idealist in me is having a coniption over this.  

I've been finding myself lonely of late.  There's no one at the church in my situation, and there hasn't been for quite some time.  Granted this is a short term problem, but I don't want these next few months to become an exercise in being reclusive.  Such is life when you're unattached heading to your mid-twenties..."

"event","This week was eventful.  Bap's funeral was on Sunday, but I didn't get to go because I had no idea where it was.  So I stood here and went to lifegroup which lasted well into the afternoon.  I did get to talk to mom (it was her grandfather) and she seems OK.

In other news, my grandmother will be going to assisted living around month's end.  She moved out of the house shortly after graduation, meaning she will have lived where she does now for about 15 months.  This is hardly unexpected, she needed something like this to protect her from herself sadly.

The car repairs finished yesterday, so I bid adieu to the rental and welcomed back my much more gas efficient car.  Looking back at that, it was probably the wisest investment I made in a while (assuming that I'll have the car for many, many years).  The investigation into the accident is still ongoing since the guy who hit me has been rather elusive.  I did get his license plate, so they will be following that lead shortly.  I had to pay the deductable, which was $500.  No problem, paid it off and drove to work.  

Speaking of the Linc, I should be able to pay it off in full by the end of this month, as well as pay for car insurance until January (courtesy of a nice birthday check).  That's one less payment I'll have to worry about.  School loans, you're next!

Yesterday XXX's son was born (see May 20th entry or so) 11 days late.  Mother and child are doing fine.  I hung out with the father and my sister (she was home this week) on Tuesday night.  It was fun, and it was good to spend some time with sis since we hadn't seen each other in quite some time.

Today was drop-dead day for getting into VT this upcoming semester.  Since there was no grant offered, I'll be defering to the spring.  

Got bit by the clean this apartment bug tonite, and started cleaning like mad at about 11.  Cleaned dishes, moped the floor, picked up all the clothes, ran a load of laundry.  I need to shut it down now or else I'll be hosed for the rest of this weekend..."

My great-grandfather, whom my grandparents temporarily moved in with, died this morning.  He was 91.  He lived in Cherry Tree, PA for as long as I can remember.  The family would visit his house in Indiana County every once in a while, primarily on the holidays.  Although I didn't get to know him that well, I remember him, at the age of 90, mind still sharp, writing a short letter expressing how pround he was of his great-grandson graduating from school.  It is a shame that he didn't get to see any great-great-grandchildren, but will be missed by those he has influenced over the years.

The same call from dad also informed me that grandma may need to be put in a home as early as this month.  This doesn't surprise me too much, she's been having difficulties doing some everyday things in life, such as getting around town, paying bills, etc.

The last few leads from VT for this fall seem to have dried up.  That means I'd be spending the rest of the calendar year here at the apartment, if nothing surprising happened in the next week and a half.  There are obvious benefits to that, which I have already listed in here.

I've been spending the last few minutes caught in a time warp.  Dimly lit room, fans blowing, kinda hot in here watching the Simpsons before calling it a night.  It's almost as if it's late August/early September at Bucknell.  Eerily similar..."

None in at least 8 years!) and leaving early Friday so I can arrive at the mountain retreat at a decent hour.  Made for some long days in the middle of the week, but I got through them without being totally unproductive.

And the mountain retreat was good.  It was one of the few things this summer that didn't disappoint me this summer after all that has gone on in the past couple of months.  There was a lot of good times, and I got to know some of the group a little bit better.  They really do look up to me as a role model, and realize that any actions I make will be scrutinized by them.

Sunday was a bit crazy- I dropped my car off at the shop down the street from the apartment here in Glenville.  I then walked up to church, and had the Markles drive me to the house where I spent the night.  I was supposed to be picked up by Enterprise the next morning around 8:15, but didn't wake up until close to 8:20.  I frantically got around and they came while I was shaving.  I picked up my car and it is an '04 Sebring.  Waaaaaaaaayyyyyyy above me, I wouldn't dream of driving a car like that everyday.  But for the week, it'll be a nice change of pace from the run-of-the-mill cars I've been driving since I learned how 7 years ago.  

Over ate today at dinner, and went for a run afterwards... and that exhausted me.  Came back here and drank too much water, so I was bloated after that.  Made me feel sick as a dog..."

This past weekend I went with mom and dad and mom and her sister's family (that would be my aunt) saw the Drum and Bugle Corps championships at Bucknell.  It was a good show, and it brought back a lot of memories of marching around hot parking lots and Mr Anderson getting up in everyone's grill about our shows...  but it was fun, and I enjoyed it.  

I've been wanting to exhale now for quite some time, but haven't found a way to do it.  I'm hoping to get the car looked at next week.  Perhaps then I can start to breathe...

I'm starting to get used to the idea of hanging around here for the next few months.  I'm realizing there's some good to that, what with the money I'd be making and all.  The car would be paid in full, and some inroads would be made into the school loans as well in all liklihood.   That and enjoying being close to the church.  I picked up David Munch today after work and talked with him a little bit.  It was a good time, even if one of his kids managed to tear down a shelf in their living room before I arrived...

But at the same time, I'd like to move on with things.  This iron is best struck hot, and that means going there as soon as possible.  That isn't my decision though, and as much as I'd like it to be, it just isn't.  It be God's, and I'm not going to mess with it."

This is the latest in a disturbing trend of lack of communication.  Think about it, what if you went through life without getting any kind of feedback, good or bad.  That's the way my work life has been since it pretty much started (save for one review in October that scared the living &^%$@*&%^ out of me) last August.  It would drive you nuts.  You do something great, you don't know.  You screw up royal, you don't know and assume everything is OK, when in reality it's the exact opposite.  For someone who has a pre-disposition to anxiety to say the least, it's not a good situation.  That may be a factor in my decision to go back to school (besides the fact that is what God has all but told me to do)- I know how I'm doing.  I do good on a test, I know it.  I do bad on a test, I better buckle down.  Research I think will go pretty much the same way.  My advisor will tell me how I'm doing, it be their job.  

I'm still trying to find a grant at VT.  One of the profs there seems to want to help me out in some way.  That would be great, even if it meant pulling up the steaks here in a few short weeks.

The mountain retreat is upcoming.  It's just what I needed.  Hanging around with them might do me a lot of good.  I plan on flexing a little bit so I can get a jump on things and show up there around dinner time.  Afterwards, as is customary, I'll swing back through Lewisburg and visit some family and friends there, although my mom's parents have left to be with my great-grandfather.  Yes, he's still alive, and is 91 yrs. old.  While his heart, lungs, and mind remain strong, the rest of him is not good.  By the sounds of things, he won't see another Christmas.  

The past few days have not been good.  There's a lot of... uncertainty.  I'm not going to say anxiety, I know what that feels like and this isn't it.  There are some things that are going to get resolved here in short order, and I'll feel really glad when they are over."

I've sent out a couple of feeler e-mails to profs down at VT to see if they've got anything for the fall.  Heard back from one already saying she doesn't have anything.  Wouldn't be too surprised if nothing was there... but I really want to get this thing started.

The accident thing is proving to be a bigger headache then I thought it ever would.  I'm still waiting word from Allstate on how much they will cover the repair bill.  They did an estimate on it and it was somewhat (about $150) lower then the estimate I had already received.  Once I hear how much they are going to cover, I'll be getting it fixed.

Pete shopped the apartment here after work.  I had the living room and kitchen in tip-top form (yes, it was cleaned up... not just stuff thrown under the cough or anything like that...) but the bedrooms were still a mess.  That hasn't changed.  It was a reminder of how close I could be until I'm outta here.

Still am very tired from camp.  I guess I just can't stay up as late as I used to and not pay for it as much.  Dave Garrett wants me there for next week, but that's not going to happen.  I'm not sure how much I'll be there for Gareth's week either... I'm sure I'll get up there at least once, but I can never be sure of anything these days it seems.

I saw War of the Worlds last night with Brian, Moody, Ben and Brian's friend Lindsay.  I thought it was OK.  I've heard the 1937 ('38?) broadcast, and the movie followed it reasonably well.  They adapted it to today's world, and changed the people and places around a little bit and lengthened it from about 45-50 minutes to 2 hrs.  It was pretty much what I had imagined the movie was going to be like coming in.  Not the best movie, not the worst movie.

"event","I'm not sure what happened, but camp didn't go as I thought it would.  There are four reasons I count for this...

1)  The Smiths.  It was front-page news in the camp area on Saturday, the first day of that week.  It put all of us in shock.  Even though there were family members there that week, thankfully it didn't come up that much at all during the week.  Thank goodness for that.

2)  It seems like that week has turned into a battleground for Christian universities.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad they exist, but it isn't like if you don't go to one you're slime.  This thinking seemed elevated this year, and passed the comfort line for me.

3)  I was a co-counselor this week, under Dave Smith.  I'm not 100% sure why, probably because I was late in giving a total commitment to working that week until late.  Nothing against Dave or anyone else I may have been under that week, but I'm just not wired that way, at least not any more.  I hadn't been a co-counselor since 2002, and before that it was 1998.  It's just something I'm no longer programmed to do.

4)  This one is bigger then the other three combined.  As I've been saying all along in here, I'm going to grad school either this fall or next spring.  That would take me away from camp, or at least the area.  It's pretty obvious to those that know me at all really how much I love that place.  And now, I feel like I'm being pulled away, for whatever reason.  Hopefully, this is a test, like Abraham and Isaac.  If God wants me at camp, there's no doubt he'll put me there.  He could down the road say that you can go to camp.  Or He wants me somewhere else.  I spoke on decisions on Friday night, and it was both the best and most difficult devotional of my life.  I talked about how we all make decisions, some good, some bad.  I also told them that because of this situation, I may have to be without CM for a while.  About half the audience I was speaking to was crying by the end of the talk.

The one thing I said in the end was two things.  One was that as long as God is #1 in your life, you'll be OK.  The second was God is with you no matter what kind of decisions you may have made.  I need to keep these things in the forefront of my mind going forward.

Not sure if my talk had anything to do with it, but there were 8 baptizms at week's end.  Friday night was absurd, there were 5 late that night and three the next morning.  It seemed like whenever we were closing up the pool, someone else was coming forward.  The first five were done by about 2 AM, and then I had night watch for the next two hours.  I got up three hours after that, and headed for home.  I was so exhausted that I slept for about 15 hours last night, and am still tired right now.  I had spent the night up in Lewisburg, witch is where the family was for the 7/4 weekend.

This experience marks the third time I've been ""blind-sided"" in the last six weeks.  I am reeling inside.  But my faith is where it needs to be, and so long as I keep God #1, I'll be OK."

Went dancing on Friday, per usual.  They had a live band there, and the place was jumping... I haven't seen the place that full in a while.  I met all kinds of follows and had a blast.  There was one that really seemed to enjoy dancing, so I got to dance with her quite a bit.  'Twas fun.

The Wilsons were over for that night, so it was good to see them.  

I did manage to get up early enough on Saturday to see the gang off to Mexico... or Texas depending on how you look at it.  They are staying in TX and then crossing the boarder everyday to get to the construction site.  But it was neat seeing them all that last time, some for two weeks.  It's going to be difficult to go back to school with all of them still there, I've become a role model to them.  But there's others there, so they won't fall off the face of the earth.

Work has let up.  There were two deadlines to meet on Monday, and I made them both.  I actually had a little extra time because some of my bosses had to leave early in the day due to family reasons.  They seem impressed with what I'm doing, so I can't get too worked up about things.

That is way more then I was expecting, but there was more damage to it that meets the eye.  The rear axle will need to be replaced, and that won't be cheap.  The quarterpanel will also have to be replaced, and that will take them a day and a half alone.  All glory told, it'll take them a week.  Not sure how I'm going to be doing that just yet.  

Yesterday was rough, I had a panic attack at work.  While they were somewhat commonplace when I worked at HADCO, this was the first I had one at Gichner.  Not sure why it happened, the boss said something about my time cards and I guess I might have read too much into it.  Another one of my bosses seems to be a real go-getter, type-A personality, which clashes quite a bit with my more laid-back approach to work.  But today went a lot better. There's a couple of deadlines tomorrow, but I'm fairly confident I can meet both of them without too much of a strain.

Five years ago yesterday I left for Mexico on my first mission trip.  Man, those were the days.  Life seemed a lot simpler back then, but time marches on I suppose.  Tomorrow, this year's crew heads for the boarder.  Rumor has it they will be crossing the boarder every day to get to the work site.  I think that's a horrible idea, given the escalated violence that has occured around the border recently, but I ain't in charge so there ain't nothing I can do about it.  I'll be there at Wal-Mart to see them off, and might go down to the airport to see the whole crew off as well since a lot of them won't be at Wal-Mart.  They'll leave at 6 AM.

I wore a hat, which took care of my head and face, but my arms and a six inch- section above either knee was charred.  It's a nice apple red right now, and it hurts like the Braves in October.  I like to think it'll be nice and tan by the time camp rolls around :-)

I left the island I headed up to Tabernacle to worship with them.  I got to sit next to the Smiths, which was special.  After eating lunch there, we all went over the the Hladkeys and hung out there for the PM.  I played nertz with Caroline and JoJean, and believe or not was holding my own until the end, when I got the stomp.  It was like 2004 all over again.  It was very encouraging to see them given what has happened, that there's a sence of normalcy, or whatever normal will be after all is said and done.  There's a lot more to be said here, but I don't think I'll get into that now.

For now, I'm counting down the days to camp (11) and am attending to my burns.  I'll have the car looked at tomorrow by a body shop right down the road from here.  I also got word that the electric company over charged me last month, so I have an electric bill of a whopping $5 for this month instead of the usual $60.  Outside of that, not much is happening.  A lot of quiet, which is exactly what I need at this point..."

"event","Man, I love this time of year.  Camp around the corner, Mexico is close, and even though I'm not going, it still gets me all nostalgic... and the post-camp high is close at hand.  I talked with one of the elders who owns a house in Chincoteague, so I get to stay there (except for food and gas and tolls) for free!!! Woo-hoo!!!!

I got in a car accident coming home from work today... it was the first time I was in an accident and it wasn't my fault.  I was turning onto 74 in D-town and was wanting to make a right hand turn.  The street I was on had a right hand turn lane that was empty, so I left a fairly long line of traffic and went to make my turn.  While I was doing this, a car came around another corner on that road and T-boned me, hitting my driver's side backseat.  Their mini-van suffered little to no damage, and my car didn't have too much done to it either since they weren't going too fast.  The door got pushed in and has a big dent in it, but I drove around a car with a big dent in it for years so it's no big deal.  There may be been some frame damage, but it's in a non-critical area.  I'll have a shop look at it to see what it would cost.  Shouldn't be too much.

Another quiet day.  Talked with the engineering boss about camp, he doesn't see any reason why I couldn't go.  Is this turning into 2003 all over again?  I'm working with a defense contractor, there was some major that happened weeks before that'll carry into camp (grandpa's death was it two years ago), and there was a sense of good feelings despite it all.  Hopefully it'll turn out to be as good as a week in aught-three.

Next weekend I've made tentative plans to head down to Chincoteague, VA for the weekend.  I'd also like to visit a congregation or two while I'm in that general vicinity.  With camp near, I need to make the most of these free weekends.  Oh the things you can do with a gas-efficient car and not being tied down with some extra cash in your wallet...

Camp is but three weeks out!!! I know I've said it already, but it's worth repeating!!! I am so jacked for that week, just like I am every summer.  It won't quite be the same as last year given what's happened, it'll probably be my only week there (instead of last year's dream run of 6) and there's no desparate job search that is on-going that will leave me questioning my family... ugh, am I glad those days are over.

It's interesting what happened over the weekend, esp. with the 5-yr anniversary of my high school graduation being tomorrow.  I was talking with a few of my buddies from high school, one on-line and another at the track here and both of them thought I was going into teaching.  I told them that I hope to be shortly while I'm in college.  Another nudge!  That's 4 if you're keeping track at home.  It's almost getting ridiculous..."

I get house and doggy all to myself for a few days!!!

The past few days have been better.  Time does indeed heal all wounds, and that is what is happening here.  It has also been very encouraging to hear that the family involved in the second case has decided to stick it out together no matter what happens, and I am blissful that that could be accomplished.  I hope to see him and his family in person soon, before camp (3 more weeks!!!! EEEEE!!!)  I have since sent three letters to his family, one to him, one to his wife and one to his four daughters (the one is on a mission trip in Scotland...)

Speaking of camp, I talked with HR at work, and they said it wouldn't be a problem taking a week off for camp so long as the head of engineering knew about it in advance.  Three weeks would be enough time.  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!

"event","Well, May is over.  Long may it be over.  The last time I can say I went through May without something or other happening was 1994.  This one was no different.  

In addition to the things listed below (although I have since heard that grandma is doing much better :-)) a couple of other things have happened...

There's been an ethical struggle inside of me about this job... I feel like I'm leading them on what with the grad school plans I've got.  It's great that I'm making $, and can help others with it as I've started to do recently, but can't help but think I'm using them.  As long as I keep putting in an honest day's pay I guess I can live with it.  

The people at work seem to not have the moral character that they had at the old job.  Granted, they weren't saints either, but they'd be more sympathetic at least to me given the situation I've found myself in since taking that job.  Again, this is a short term problem, so I'm not all too worried about it.

I've yet to talk to anyone at work about camp.  Hopefully they'll let me go for a week or two, since I'm technically not working for them, I'm working for the temp agency.  It's a techinality, but it's a good one.

And what would my life be like without another heartbreak?  It happened again, but given my luck, it was hardly a surprise.  People keep telling me that I need to tied so to speak, and for once I don't think it'd be that bad at this point.  I mean, I'm out on my own, I have plans going forward, granted they aren't around here, but once I settle down, why not?  I'm going to grad school because I don't have anyone at this point.  But if someone shows up, then that's no longer true and staying put sounds like a better option.  Wait, what am I saying... that's not going to happen, so I might as well just, in the words of Jim Heitmann, FUHGEDDABOUDDIT!!!!

Yet through it all, I feel a lot stronger.  I needed this month.  I've learned a lot, albeit the hard way.  As for today, I told Allen about the two major incidents listed below.  He seemed visibly upset.  Can't blame him- I had to hit him with bad news twice over.  My friend in question will have his day in court on Thursday, so I've been mentally preparing for what could be a media blitz on the story and their family.  Hopefully they won't exploit them too much......"

Their ex-minister will be going to court on Thursday, and will be subjected to local, if not (hopefully not) regional/national attention.  One thing that was said that stands out in my mind is how this could be their finest hour.  After visiting there, they seemed determined to make it work no matter what happens.  Sunday night the elders talked with the congregation here at Glen Rock and filled them in on the situation.  I thought I'd never see the day...

Sunday night was fun, went with the youth group to BK.  Their service was really slow, I don't think they had more then 4 people working there.  After stopping by the Carpers for a breif stint, Nick, Moody and myself drove back to Brian's house to spend the night.  The only problem was that he wasn't at his house, and we ended up spending the night here at the apartment.  Turns out Bri was at another church member's house until 1:30...

Today was good, there was a picnic at the house with mom's side of the family.  It's the first time in a very long time I remember something like that happening at our house.  Usually it's up in Lewisburg since it's where my grandparents live.  After that was over, I went to the driving range with Adam.  There was a rainbow in the sky just before we started tee-ing off.  Almost as if the Big Guy was saying it's going to be OK.  I am not good at that, and it showed bad.  I hit 3-4 balls off the tray that holds the rest of your golf balls and sent balls in every which direction. But I still had fun.

Shock from the latest entry is starting to wear off.  He'll be in court Thursday, which means we'll probably hear something about it from the news on Friday or possibly late Thursday.  It was really encouraging seeing one his daughters mindset, it is one of faith despite the fact that her family has undergone a major upheaval.

It wasn't as fun this time, but it was still worth the trip down there to see them play.  They've got a fun team to watch this year and it's really disappointing to see them not draw anywhere near what I'm used to.

Went dancing friday for the first time in 5-6 weeks, before the Sr. High retreat at least.  It was good to get out there and see people I haven't seen in a while.  They are good people, and it's a shame that I couldn't be out there more often recently, but life moves forward.  While on the dance floor I boogered up my knee... the top part of my leg went one way and the lower went another and the thing just buckled...

After dancing... I'll get to that in a bit...

Spent today at a yard sale for the church's mission trip into Mexico at the Shultz's.  They've raised around $800 for the kids going on that trip, one that I myself went on in 2000 and 2001.  It was good to help them out.  It started to rain around 1-2, so I helped cover the stuff up before it get all wet.  I hung out there until about 5, watching a movie and talking with the Shultzes about... 

...the phone call I got after I got back from dancing on Friday.  Once again, names will not be mentioned, but I will tell the situation.  One of my best friends called to tell me that a preacher at one of the churches in the area, a man that I have looked up to for many years, admitted to his congregation on Thursday that he had an inappropiate relationship with a 9th grader in his church.  After confessing, he walked out of the building and went to turn himself into the police.  I immediately went into shock, and still haven't come out of it.  It's not very often in life that twice within two weeks you see one of your role models fall like this.  I'll be traveling, with some friends who know people at this congregation, to this church to support them.  They will need it, for I could see them folding over something like this.  I'll be leaving from home to get a jump on things and be there in time for at least their worship service.

"event","Wow... sorry I haven't updated in a while, but something happened last weekend that prevented me from getting back on here.  It has dominated my thoughts and actions since then, and it was something that I was privy to earlier.  While I will elaborate on what it was here, I won't say who is involved (those who read this will know how I'm talking about in all likelihood).

The singles retreat was refreshing, even if I was one of the youngest there and didn't know anyone else except the director.  The speaker there did an outstanding job, and learned a lot about what it takes to be a Christian.  But with my sleep cycle outta whack to begin with, and by sleeping in the backseat of my car Saturday AM (!) I couldn't risk another bad night's sleep before showing up at my first day of work the next Monday.  So I packed it in and took off for home Saturday night.  Glad I did, because I didn't get a good night's rest on Sunday night...

On Sunday after PM services, one of my best friends sat down with me and another one of my best friends and told us that he got his then-girlfriend pregnent and is expecting in mid-July.  Needless to say, this caught us waaaaaaaaayyyyy off guard.  This triggered a whole line of thinking which I'll get to in a moment.

I didn't get a good night's rest because of that (and the subsequent thinking) but went about work that first week alright.  Obviously, my thoughts were elsewhere (as they still are to some extent), but it was an easy week.  They didn't throw much at me and was finding it hard to occupy myself for 8 hours a day.  This hasn't changed, and have no idea when it might change later.  This is a stark contrast to my previous job where I was on my toes and working extra hours to get jobs done.  One thing that did happen was a blood drive, and I gave a pint of blood.  They had door prizes and I won a cooler full of soda, which I used for...

...a camping trip close to Fawn Grove by the church youth group.  There was a good turn-out amongst the younger kids, and they occupied themselves quite well during the weekend.  We managed to get back to church in time to hear XXX's confession.  And when he did, I lost it.  I've often said I'll either loose it a little bit, or I'm gone.  I was gone.  Even though I already knew about it, it was just traumatic almost seeing that happen... he was one of those guys I grew up with, that wasn't supposed to do things like that... but he did.  Then I thought if he could do it, I could just as easily do it.  Yikes.  

I came out of a non-Christian environment for four years stronger in faith then when I had left it.  I had followed what God wanted me to do afterward despite a lot of people near-forcing me not to.  During that summer I had started a relationship that ended soon afterward, but I didn't do anything I regret now, and a lot of good came from that.  I had just licked this anxiety thing recently (see the first entry) and was feeling awesome.  I wasn't perfect, no one is, but I was on a winning streak.  Then this happened, and I thought, if he did it, then I could do it.  But wait a minute, all sins are equal, so in effect, I did do it.  Sure this one has more consequences, but I messed up just as bad as he did.  It was the closest sin has ever gotten to me, and it scared the crap outta me.  Then I thought, wait, there's a way out of this... the Christ.  He's overlooked XXX's sins, and he's overlooked mine.  Did I believe that before?  Sure, but it has new meaning now, I REALLY need it.  I don't want to say I took it forgranted in the past, but perhaps I didn't value it enough.  That's changed now.  I talked with Terry about this, and he said it was the realization of spiritual mortality.  The concept that your spirit is dead, but Christ can revive it.  That is a concept that is really powerful, if you only stop to think about it.  No matter how bad a sin, be it the ""smallest"" offense or something as big as sex out of wedlock, it's wiped out.  I just hope I don't have to learn this all over again first-hand, or learn it second-hand from a close friend again..."

I didn't go with anyone, but had a good time anyway.  I was at about the middle of the high fence they have in right field.  Listening to the hecklers go to work about the Twins RF was worth the price of admission.  A couple of the Orioles HRs were close to where I was standing, and whenever one was heading over the fence there was a mad scramble to get the ball.  Highly enjoyable, and I wish to be going down there as often as I can.  It was cheap, $8 for the ticket, $3 for the light rail and about $5 worth of gas.  The team is good, so I don't mind spending $20 for an evening to watch a team of this caliber.  Hopefully they can hold off the Yanks as the year rolls on..."

I drove up to the house after that to see mom, what with it being Mom's day and everything.  We talked about anything and everything, and it really helped put these nerves of mine on ease.  It was badly needed.  So that's why there's a mother's day...

Today was exciting, I got a job offer with Gichner.  It was the last of the three interviews I had a few weeks ago, and it was surprising.  I wasn't expecting to hear back from them for several weeks, and was also expecting another interview.  This is a three month contract, meaning that if VT has anything I can go there no problem.  The way I see it, there's 5 possible outcomes.

Best case: VT has a spot for me this fall, and I'm able to get off for a week or two at camp. I'll be paid better then I was before, albeit without benefits, and I'm able to pay off my bills as well as pay off my new car before heading to hokie haven. Since it's a three-month contract, there's no problem with leaving after it's over even if they were hoping it wouldn't come to that.

Good case: VT has a spot, but not until spring. I'd have to go through this whole ethics thing all over again in three months, but I'll worry about it then. At least I'll have a well-paying job as an option, but I may be uncomfortable working there given the situation.

Didn't see it coming case: VT doesn't let me in, but at least I've got a very good job out of it. Not likely to happen.

Not-so-good case: VT has a spot, but not until spring. Gichner finds out about my plans, and won't let me work there after the three months ends.

Worst case: VT doesn't let me in, and Gichner doesn't like my work and I'm out of a job in three months. This is extremely unlikely to happen.

So, the worst that can happen is that I'm pretty much right where I am now in three months. Can't be that bad. There are some ethical issues in there, but none in the immediate future. Camp status at this point is uncertain, and won't know until the end of the month.  Still, it'll be good to do something and not have to worry about burning up my savings.  In fact, with this job paying what it does, I should be able to pay off the car, put a dent into the school loan and still save quite a bit of $ if the good case as described above happens.  It can't be that bad.

There's a single's retreat at camp, and I'm still not committed to going.  I'd like to, but if some of my friends are going, then I'll go.  Even if they don't, I still might go anyway.  I've got to do something about this whole being single thing..."

It seems the peace that was so prevailent a few weeks back is missing, as I don't know what to make of short-term objectives.  That ethics struggle (see previous) is weighing on me, and is part of the reason I want to go back to school- so I can escape the corporate world.  I've determined I can't survive there, my breif encounter with it at HADCO was not a good one- it just seemed so corrupt that they would rather cut someone who is trying to make a living so that they can play golf during the work week or make sure they stay in 4-5 star hotels when they are on the road.  I'm not sure if this is common everywhere, but if it is, I don't want any part of it.  Long-term things seem to be OK, go back to school and that will get you well past the foreseeable future.

Haven't heard anything about grandma recently.  Dad went up there this weekend to visit her.  This too is weighing on me... I knew it wasn't good, but seeing her the other day just really caught me off-guard.

Job trail is starting to go cold.  I know what I'll be doing long-term, but this is a rare instance where I'm looking more at the short term then long, since that seems to be taken care of.  I did get an e-mail saying one of the three letters is done, and drove up to Lewisburg again today to make sure a second gets done.  A third should be done before this week is out, meaning VT will have everything they need from me before they leave for the summer.  I did send a resume to United Defense, since they have a position open for someone with my qualifications.  I loved working there for the summer a few years back, and wouldn't be opposed to going back there, provided it's OK to work there for a couple months.

After talking with the profs, I played frisbee with the boys there at the U for the rest of the afternoon.  Boy, am I out of shape!  I thought running a few times a week, walking to church, and swing dancing on Fridays was enough... nope.  I'll be so soar tomorrow I won't be able to see straight...

After walking peg-legged into my car, I drove to my grandmothers... and I wish I hadn't.  She had a baseball-softball sized bruise on her forehead, black eyes down to the bottom of her cheekbones as a result of a fall she had on her kitchen floor two weeks ago.  It was extremely sad to see her in this condition.  She can't carry on conversations for more then a minute or so, and just seems out of it.  I know I have a duty here, but seeing people in bad conditions I am just not good at.  I couldn't bear to see my grandfather in his last days, or when my other grandfather was in the hospital following his accident in 2000.  I want to remember the grandmother whose house I would ride my bike to when I was in Lewisburg, who used to hold Christmas parties when I was little, not the one I saw today...

Upon seeing this, I wanted to get home and tell dad about her mom.  He said that she did that two weeks ago (she said it happened that afternoon) and we then proceded to get into an argument about my plans for grad school.  He is critical of how I've now definately chosen to make a run at grad school, and he still wants me to look for a permanent job.  I just can't bring myself to that- applying for jobs when I could be out the door in three or seven months.  It seems unethical to me- they want me to be there for a longer period of time, but I just can't hide that from them.  I could be wrong about this, but I don't see how.  I do plan on working with a temp agency until then.  This seems to be the best way out, no commitment, flexibility, time off for camp.

"event","I got my application completed and sent off to VT last night.  Hopefully, the profs that I wanted letters from will be on it and get them done in a timely manner.  To ensure that gets done, I'll be up in Lewisburg tomorrow.  It's the last day of classes, and it'll be nice to see what the next class did with their senior design projects.  I'll also be visiting my grandmother and uncle Steve while I'm up there.  She needs the company; she hasn't been quite the same since grandpa died nearly two years ago.  

Today is a punt.  Nothing left to do on the VT front except wait to hear back from them.  Haven't heard anything on the job front, and that might not be such a bad thing, considering my mind has all but been made up.  Sixers play tomorrow, and it looks like it'll be their last game of the season.  Not much was expected of them, so I won't be too disappointed if they lose.  Weather outside is icky, cold and drizzling.  I was hoping to get a jog in today, but I won't if it's raining.  Yep, I be a pansy....."

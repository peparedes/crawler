"event","or ""I'm really bored and lonely so I'm going to smoke some pot and type up a long post""

So, life has become <i>very</i> stupid as of late. My life consists of going to work, then coming home and trying to entertain myself for hours at a time. Maybe if I'm lucky, I get to hang out with Matt or Corey, but with their work schedules and girlfriends, that doesn't really warrant that much hang out time. I'm sure it's how they felt when I was with Emily, always gone to visit someone they didn't really know, but at least they got to hang out together then. Now I just feel like life is this long, boring thing that everyday I hope ends through some freak accident. Poopydicks.
Anyway, I'm going to write about why I am who I am. Or at least, what I think has to do with who I think I am. I guess it'd be funny if who I thought I was had nothing to do with how others see me, and render the rest of the post pointless. But, I'm not doing anything anyway, so away we go.

My dad never had much time with his father. Or rather, my grandfather didn't pay much attention to his family. He apparently was a drunk, and that caused a divorce between my two grandparents. Growing up my dad was gone a lot for his job. There was a nine month period when he was living and working in Oregon because the company he worked for was on strike, and he went there to cover their jobs and get paid more money dollars. When he was home and doing his job in town, he spent a lot of hours, even at home, on his work. On weekends he'd try and spend some ""quality"" time with me and my sister, and would constantly worry about if he was being a good father or not, as he never had the experience as a child himself.
I want to come out and say ""Yes, you were a good father"" but I don't know if that's neccisarily true. Not that he was a bad father either, it was more of not being a father at all. What he was, more than anything, was a provider. He got good at that job in the last two or so moves we had to make as a family.
Still, to see where all this is coming from, I guess I have to really see where he was before he was the provider.
My family, as in generations of family, haven't had a lot of money. My dad, who was the real studious type in highschool, had aspirations for college. Seeing as how my grandmother, who ran a farm on her own, couldn't provide this education (and my grandfather wouldn't, nor could he), he went into the army. They paid for his college, where he met my mother, and as per his contract entered the service upon graduation. My grandfather, my dad's older brother, and now him had all been in the army. Grandfather in WW2, Uncle Steve in Vietnam, and my dad for college. So, he figured he'd fit in well in the army. It's what the Cooley's had been doing for 40 or so years, so it ought to be alright, eh?
Well it wasn't. My dad hated the army. I'm not sure if it's the traveling that made him so upset, but that the army wasn't this strict governing body with it's employees. The amounting of dicking-off that was done amoung his coworkers as compared to him drove him crazy. He worked his ass off while others in his department did nothing, and no one was reprimanded for it. Still, the hard work my father did caught attention, and this sort of work was expected of him all the time. Six years, a few suicide attempts, and an honorable discharge later, he moved back to the States where I would be soon born, and he would start the family life.

Now, I told you all this backround in the hopes that you could all pick out parts of my personality based on what influences I've laid out above. Well, I'm going to point them out anyway, because this is where that ""Who I think I am/who you see me as"" comes in, so I might as well spell out who I see myself as while I'm in all of this.

From my dad, I've always been taught to do the right thing. My family became a church-going family, mainly because my parents wanted good values instilled in my sister and I. I'm not going to go into all of that business, but sufficient to say I think I have a pretty good sense of values that I live my life by. These came a lot from what my father pounded into my head for years and years, and (especially) the experiences I had in high school.
The whole provider thing I just kind of picked up from being in the same general area of the man for so long. Sure, I'm not paying for my friend's cars, or rent, or groceries every week, but I do what I can. I almost always share everything I get to eat, offer to pick up checks for my friends every now and then (or don't ask for my money back when I cover them), and generally just help them out with things when in need.
My intense sense of monogamy comes from my father, and from the times I was dicked over by girls in highschool. This really applies to honor and loyalty, not just monogamy, really.
My worries come from a combination of my father, and a history of depression on my mother's side, but that's another post.





So this was a lot sloppier than I had liked it to be, but oh well, it doesn't really matter. I was going to go on about a lot of other influences, but I don't think I feel like making the commitment to a post that'd esculate this post 8 times as long as it is now. Even if I did, I doubt it'd hold enough interest for people to actually <i>read</i> it, anyway. So, I'm thinking I'll break this up into several posts over the next few days, all showing different influences on what has made me who (I think) I am.
Though not every post will show new qualities, but rather more backround that re-enforces previously established personality traits."

"event","I thought it was funny. Kind of a ""Matt parade"" what with all of those pictures of Matt going in a wavy motion. Wooha!

So it's 3 AM according to my computer clock. That's not fucking true. It was accurate when I left at 2:40 AM to go deliver papers, I wonder when and why it fucking changed. Someone give technology a middle finger for me.

Speaking of papers, today sucked.
First of all, I feel sicker than I have been in a long while, namely my throat. I'm coughing regularly and it feels like someone made me swallow a quart of razor blades. Anything that touches my throat, even a bedsheet, makes me feel like I can't breathe. My back/shoulders are REALLY fucking killing me, and I don't know anyone that can give me a decent massage.
You can imagine how this made me feel when I went out at 4 am to run papers to 55 or so houses. Fan-fucking-tastic (Woooo, I got to use my favorite word). Was it a normal job this would've been one of those days I called off, but I didn't like thinking of Ashley having to do that whole route all on her own, and only on her fourth day.
Ashley's Dad came with us. Again. I know he's just being a good father, but I'd rather him not be there. It's kind of cool that he drives and me and Ash just get to bail out the back seats with papers in hand, inbound for our houses, but the guy also wants to hold the map and try to direct us to our houses. That's not so cool, because I always end up having to just lean forward and look at where I'm going anyway, making his role more of a hinderence than assistance. But whatever. I guess he has nothing else to do at 3 to 5 AM, and doesn't seem bothered doing it. That's it for my rant on papers.

Random info on shit that's happened since my last update:
-Yesterday I masturbated for the first time in like 3 days.
-I've been having a reoccuring dream where I'm in a pool with a bunch of random people. Suddenly, I go deaf, and soon after discover that my heart has stopped beating. I wake up. Had that dream 6 times since 4 PM Tuesday afternoon.
-I finally got my lisceince renewed.
-I got a buzz-cut.
-Haiduke and Cliff Hanger have been taken to the animal shelter.
-Emily tried to get ahold of me, which is always against my wishes.


I guess I'm going to go back to sleep, not that I'm tired. I'm just really bored and don't feel like playing videogames. Hopefully a shower and a personal HJ will change something. Booyakasha."

While it sucked ""not learning"" anything, he did throw me into some tables all on my own, and that's really the best way to learn. Short of an arguement with a little bitch, and a disagreement with my actual trainer about jerking off on the job, it was a good night.
I'm tired, and I don't know why. I worked 4 or so hours after sleeping from 2ish till noonish. Still, whether it makes sense or not, I'm still tired and have to be somewhere at 2 am for a pseudo-work thing. Yays.
Matt, I hope that date with a vagina is going well. Thanks for posting it on the fridge. <3"

Fuck I'm tired. It's 9:30, and I'm getting home from work. It wouldn't be SO bad, but I didn't get to bed until 3, and even then I probably couldn't sleep for an hour due to the fucking heat and all of the things I had on my mind. Let me explain:

I had all but given up on the Ashley ordeal. Throughout the week I invited her over 3 times, and none of the times were accepted. ""Fine"" I thought, ""she'll hang out sometimes, and that'll be that."" I really don't want to fuck around, or play games, and she was giving some pretty obvious hints that she's not interested.
Then she shows up here last night at 2 AM as I'm finishing ""Collateral"". We had talked earlier in the day on AIM for the first time, and that went well I guess. She was so quiet when she was here though, but she was dressed up. After we watched an episode of Bullshit and smoke/drank some, I asked if she wanted to see my room for no other reason than that I'm very proud of it. She was really hesitant, but decided to come up anyway. I told her on the way up that it wasn't a stupid trick, and that I just wanted to show off my room, that's it. It went well until she asked about the Unicorn on the wall, which I guess I should have taken down by now. She left shortly after, and that was that. I'm going to call her later and tell her that she has to come to lunch with me today since tommorow is my birtday, and we are both going on vacation this week. So, hope that goes well. I might have the blunt ass ""Here's how I see things, and here's what I'd be ok with"" talk afterwards, but I don't know.

A lot of my alcohol is gone. Fuck. Wish I wouldn't of overdrawn my bank account by $8, then I wouldn't of had to pay a billion fees with my check today, and maybe I could've had some money for Vegas. Oh well, C'est la vie.

Not much else to report on. Work is going OK. I'm excited about my trip. I have to poop. Corey just woke up, so I'm sure there's either A) Maintenence men working on our AC downstairs, or B) Shenanigans are afoot.
Either one is cool with me."

"event","So I guess I should start this post off with a message to Bryan. I'm sorry I couldn't come down to your party, but sometimes things come up. It's rough when you're living on your own in an entirely different city. I'm really sorry I couldn't come down, but I hope you had a great 21st. The only consilation that I can think to offer is that I probably couldn't of gotten into a lot of the bars you went into anyway.

Now that I have that out of the way, I want to mention that I <i>always</i> think of long detailed posts while in the shower, but I'm always too lazy to sit down and type them out. So my intention to update has been there, but my fingers are weak. Anyway, here's the most detailed post in awhile, so enjoy.

The past few weeks have been decent. I cut back my hours a little bit at work so I have a little more free time, but my financial situation really isn't effected by it as my tips have gone up per table. So whatever. Other than whiney 16 year olds that I have to put up with, and a semi-incompetent team of Managers, and the customers, work is great. I know that sounds sarcastic, but I do really like my job. Sure, Monique is a close minded, pushy bitch who can't keep her 16 year old mouth shut. Yes, Marnie is the worst person to ever dawn a Managers shirt. You already know that only senile, blind, ""golden generation"" patrons make up the mainstay of Bob Evan's cash flow.
Still, I like the job. It's really not that much work, and I can ignore anything that really sets me off, such as the things listed above. The money is good, hours aren't bad, and I get to work with some cool (or at least interesting) people that help the day go by.
So that's good.

I haven't really heard from Emily in a while, and that's the way I like to keep it. As I mentioned before, the past few weeks have been decent. When someone asks me how I am, I say ""good"" and genuinely mean it. It took over a month to be ""fine"" and now that I'm ""Good"" I would like to keep it that way. Corey and I had a conversation about this a few nights ago. Ricky, one of his more serious ex's, called and left a drunk message on the machine. His response was ""Fuck, I liked it better when I thought she was dead."" This statement is really, really true. Not that I hate Emily. I love her still, with all of my heart. But those people are the ones that hurt you the worst, and if they DO hurt you, well, they're out of your life. Not neccisarily because you want them to be, but because it's just too painful to have them around.

Ben Fold's Five just came on my random list on Winamp...fuck you Corey, I hate this guy.

Ashley, blah. What can I say about this? She's this pale (woofuckinghoo) girl that I work with, and one of the only people I really respect at Bob Evan's. That and she's really, really cute. I'm really conflicted on how she feels about me, mainly because I can't read her worth a shit. I don't know what I want to do about the whole situation of her opening up into more (albeit small) parts of my life. From just working, to talking a lot every shift/sharing smoke breaks, to coming over for the first time the other night.
I really dig the girl, but I don't know what I want. For right now, I really enjoy her company, and I figured I'll leave it at that and let things just work themselves out, and hope that inaction won't be a cause for missing out on anything. Then again, perhaps I'll give her a gentle shove before we each go on our vacations next week, and see what happens there.

I'm glad to be staying in Columbus for another year and not having to worry about a new living arrangement, and I can't wait to get rid of the smelly, annoying cats. No more than 2 weeks is my hope, and then they'll be gone. If I'm going to really live here, I want to have at least a respectable house that I don't feel at least partly ashamed of when I invite company over. That includes getting this fucking air conditioner fixed, because I'm sick of sweating in my computer chair right before I go to sleep due to my house being 85 degrees, probably hotter here on the second floor.

Vanessa should be home from her vacation any day now, and I'm excited about that. As of right now she's probably my only real friend here in Columbus. Sure, she's not really what most of my friends are like, but we have a good time when we're together, and I've never felt my time was wasted when we hang out or talk. It'll be nice to have her around again, so I'm looking forward to that.

Really, REALLY want to get our sketch ideas planned out and start making it happen. Even if it doesn't really go anywhere, it'll still feel like a great accomplishment to me and be the source of a lot of pride. I want to do it, and I want to do it right. If you're interested in helping, let me know. We'll need extra people to act, help with ideas for script changes, ect. You all should have my AIM name, or just leave a comment here.

Well, I think I'm going to cut this post short for now as it's approaching 3 AM and I work at 11. Peace out diz-awgs."

"event","I smoked way too much today. I ran out of cigs last night, and didn't get around to buying a new pack until I went to get food around 4 in the afternoon.

For the first time since early April I'm feeling comfortable with my life. I don't have to worry about money anymore, work is balancing out, and I'm content with my social life. Not to say there isn't room for improvement, but I'm happy. The parties the go along with hanging around Vanessa are more of an entertainment of seeing how much I can hate people then enjoying any company of stupid drunk assholes. Also, I know where I'm living for the next year, and I won't have to deal with bullshit cats. HURRAY.

I have to go home this weekend to get my Tux fitted for the wedding and finalize plans for Vegas. I really don't want to go home and see my mom mope around the house, but some things have to be done I guess. She's just getting way to pester-y about me not being in Cinci for at least 2 months.

The phone call from Ashley the other night really caught me off guard, though not as much as the info she delivered. It's been on my mind more than it should be lately, so I'm anxious for her to get back in town so the whole thing can be done with.

Well, it's time to crash, goodnight all.

Also congrats Matt, I'm really happy for you. Corey too, I guess."

I'm starting to get into my ""early to bed, early to rise"" routine in preperation for school, so that's good. Plans fell through tonight to go party at Miami with Bryan/Lis, but hopefully we can actually reschedule for another night this weekend.

My sister got her cat today from the Makepeace's, and it cried from before we left their house until it got to Sara's apartment and started eating food. I hope it's ok, that has to be such a scary situation.

My dad is going to only pay 2 more years for a car, and the payments have to be under $400/month. I've completely written off the possibility of buying another sports car, so I'm going with a 2004 Cavelier, and pocketing a few thousand dollars for rent/whatever else...though that plan has yet to be approved by the parents. I'd like to spend the remaining money on a kick-ass computer, but I don't know if I can/should. It all depends on my job situation/monthly expenses/college shit.

In other news, it's a matter of weeks until I move into my new townhouse with two very good friends. Matt, Corey, you need to get wireless-g network adapters if you want access to the internet. So, yeah, get on that. I can show you mine (still in box) if you want ideas.

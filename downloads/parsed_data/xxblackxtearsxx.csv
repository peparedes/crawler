"event","filled with flea marketing, drinking, and general good times. I haven't had a nice weekend in awhile. Saturday I went to the meadowlands flea market with Alex where we found some fun stuff. Then we went to Hoboken to catch lunch with Katie Mack, she's such a dollface cutie pie. hehe. Then we went to Maxwells for about 7 hours haha. Became friends with Jason Gleason from Further Seems Forever so that was groovy beans. After the show at Maxwells I went back to Alex's where we took a two hour nap because we had to get up at 5am for a Flea Market we were going to in CT with Ryan Matthews from the TV show Oddities. We found some cool stuff at the flea market and spent several hours there, it was a gorgeous fall day so it was quite nice. After the flea market we went back to Brooklyn to drop off the things that Ryan bought at the flea market, his apartment is crazy. He has all these skeletons, taxidermy, and body parts displayed; its actually quite cool. Then we headed to the bar High Horse to finish of the night. Twas not bad. I made two new friends, so that's always fun. Beats work!

"event","So most of this week I was in Philly. It was pretty awesome skipping class and just having fun for once. I hung out with Alex for all of it. That was the most time I spent with him, since I first flew out to meet him 4 years ago. So much fun, I love that dude. We went to go see Astronautalis on Tuesday and then saw The Psychadelic Furs and Happy Mondays on Wednesday night. Good times. 

I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do after graduation. I was thinking about going to graduate school but now I'm kinda shooting down the idea. I don't really have the money or drive to go through another two years of schooling. So with that realization I think I am going to stay out east. It's either that or move to LA, that's where most of the video jobs are. Anyway, I think I'm going to move to New Jersey and commute to the city for work. That's the plan for now. It's gonna be a rough year at first but I think I can do it. I'm a hard worker and actually have pretty good luck in finding jobs and cool people to network with. 

Yikes! 

2010 is gonna be a scary scary year."

"event","Wow. Last night was such a blast. I went up to New Haven, CT to see Thursday. They were so amazing, I have bruises on the back of my thighs from rocking out too much at the bar hahaha.  After the show I was waiting outside for Geoffy to get back from walking this odd girl back to her car when I made friends with Tucker. While talking to him he invited me onto the tour bus, it was pretty amazing. So I hung out on the tour bus with the Thursday dudes till Geoffy got back. Once he was back we went to my hotel I booked for the night and he showered there. We were in desperate need of some alcohol and nothing was around so we ended up going back to the bus where we had some vodkaaaa. We refilled our red cups and walked back to the hotel. We hungout and told silly stories and did some other fun stuff. Then Geoffy went home since he had a huge show to play the next day. And I passed the fuck out. hahaha. so much alcohol was involved last night, I haven't had a fun night like that in such a long time. I miss my music life."

I still work at the box office too where I make zilch. haha. This year I have been thinking about taking a trip to Berlin, Paris, or Amsterdam for my birthday. Although I can't decide which I wanna do, probably the trip that costs the least. haha. Not much else going on, just working, playing stupid xbox games, hanging out with the same people.

We drank, started setting up the new Eyeball office, and watched silly TV shows. Nothing too exciting but a great night nonetheless. After thinking lots and lots over I decided to stay on campus another year. As much as I really want to get the fuck off Purchase, I also need to think about my financial future. If I stay on campus another year I can pay off my credit card bill and maybe even save a little money for after I graduate and move away. Damn rational thinking.
I will probably go home in June for my little sister's high school graduation. Makes me feel old. Haha. Oh well, I love the little turd.

In all honesty, McCain's policies would have benefited me personally more than Obama's policies would. But it's not about voting for your selfish needs. It's about our country. Which is why I voted for Obama. I really think he's better for this country as a whole than McCain.

Today I mailed in my request for an absentee ballot for the election in hopes to keep McCain out of office. His VP candidate is fucking awful. What self respecting woman would even consider voting for a woman who doesn't even support women. haha if that made any sense.
 
In an upbeat note, I watched Obama's speech Thursday night. Man. What a dude, he's so inspiring. I really think he and Biden make a great team. I really hope they make it into office. This country needs a big change and fast and that team is the best to do it.

Sigh, the election just stresses me out. I feel like if McCain wins I may just move out of the US as soon as I graduate. I can't get down with that guy."

anyway, i've been looking into graduate schools and i found one in San Francisco that I really want to go to. It's not that expensive and it's away from New York. I have been contemplating whether or not I wanted to stay out here after I graduated from Purchase, and I think this past weekend sealed the deal on how much I don't want to be out here anymore. The people I know suck, not only for the aformentioned false promises, but because they are all so consumed in their own lives to care about anything else. I was thinking that maybe it was me just being self absorbed or something, but I took a step back out of my own little warped mind and realized it was not. Another reason could be that I am very certainly going insane. Which could be probable. All I do is sit on the computer all day and fiddle with various HTML and video things. 

in other news, to make me feel just oh so wonderful, my mother is going to florida when i am home in milwaukee. what a bitch. im in wisconsin, like 9 days out of the year, and she has to be gone when I am home. I find that ridiculous. i kinda don't want to go home for christmas just to stick it to her. yes, i am oh so rebellious. i just may not go home for that, gotta kick the relying on the parents habit sometime. Although, I haven't gotten money or anything from them in a long long time since I have a job now and like 2 grand in the bank. I still need more money, I'm going to look for another job/a job during the school year, so I can bring in more money. Im saving up for when I graduate so I can get an apartment and have somewhere to live while I get a job. 

Phew. anyway, this is the end of my rant. Im kinda bummed that I use to be so happy, but I fell into a little depressed pit for a couple days. I'm slowly pulling back out of it and becoming happy again. The first step is to get out of this damned house. hahaha. the end."

Sometime during the last week of July I'm going to meet up with my uncle and cousin since they are going to be out east. And then Im going home august 5-12th. I think im taking off the last week of july just because if I don't I will be so beat. haha. Oh and yes I'm going to see Max about a BILLION times during the course of that week, but I never see him, so who knows when i'll be able to see him again. I'm gonna milk that shit. haha.

Anyway, if you wanna hang out while I'm home be sure to holla at me.

"event","let's see... let's see...

well i am now doing that freelance job. it's actually pretty bad ass. my boss is really awesome and i get paid like 400 bucks every week for 3 days of work. so it's not a bad situation. i'm actually house sitting his house in like...a week and a half and am staying there for almost 3 weeks while his family is in Italy. Im going to make 1500 bucks during that time while he's gone for the house sitting and doing work.

with my newly found wealth i plan on spending it on my trip to austin for sxsw and hopefully maybe seattle again during the first week of august. Im going home august 5th-12th, but I can't wait. I'll be home for the state fair, brewers games, and summer fun. hopefully it'll feel like summer this time! last august when i went home it was 45 degrees! haha.
anyway, im done babbling now. my life is boring. I work, come home and eat, go to bed. It's not exciting but im content with it for now.

oh yeah, im over boys. no more sex for vanessa this summer.



xoxo."

"event","this finding a job shit is getting real old real quick.
next week i am ""apparently"" starting to do the freelance web design shit for some guy. but i can never get ahold of him , so I feel like that job is going to fall apart.

In the meantime I've been looking for other jobs. On tuesday I went to an Apple seminar where they try to brainwash you. I somehow got a call back for an interview. Lord knows how that happened. haha. We had to pick a product from the store and explain why we wanted it. I totally picked a video camera that had nothing to do with Apple, while everyone else picked the MacBook Air or iPhone or some shit like that. haha. Anyway, this Tuesday I have an interview there, so we'll see how that plays out.

I also went to an interview this morning to be a receptionist at a hair salon. It's pretty easy work, but the key thing is that is close. A 5 minute drive away. And with the ridiculous gas prices this summer, that makes me want the job. Ha.

Anyway, other than that, my life is alright. I have been socializing a lot these last few days. Who wouldv'e thought. I met one of my neighbors who lives in the apartment next to mine. We are gonna party it up this summer. haha. exciting.


that is all.
Oh and I can't wait for the Lost season finale next week! eeee!

xoxo."

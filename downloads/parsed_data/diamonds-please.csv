"event","So... I learned some new things today!  Did you know...
*There were eighteen people in the Dominican Republic who suffered from Machihembra; they start out (physically) as females and develop into males.  Hmm interesting.
*Swans are compleately monogamous.  Like humans, the early excitement of their ""relationships"" are replaced by calmness, intimacy, and a sense of wellbeing.  Otherwise known as companionate love.
*There IS a hormone known as the ""cuddling hormone"".  Its an opiumlike hormone called Oxytocin that is released when people cuddle.
*Peahens, female peacocks, almost never mate with the first male they encounter.  They prefer to mate with the most gorgeous peacocks because they are the ones with the big genes.  ( directly quoted from The Science of Romance by Nigel Barber :OP )

Anyways, on another note, today was a good day.  My morning, believe it or not, was GREAT.  So I got Garnier Fructis shampoo and conditioner and I've used it once before but its been a while.  And ya know how a lot of the time smells trigger memories!?  Well I started shampooing my hair and I had one of those Herbal Essense ""ahh"" ""yes"" moments in the shower because the the last time I used Fructis was in Hawaii.  All these memories started flowing into my head and it was GREAT.  I spend an extra 5 minutes in the shower just enjoying myself haha lol.  It was incredibly cold and windy today though which is no good, but the snow tonight was pretty and made up for it.  Thats about it for today.  Goodnight :O)"

"event","Today was a grose day all around!  Slush everywhere making the walk to and from class just plain grose!! Especially since I ran all the way to my first class to find out that it was cancelled, but there is a reason for everything, and the reason for this was because I didn't have time to do my english homework last night :O) someone was watchin out for me.  I didn't have time to work out today which isn't good, but I did get everything done that I set out to do, thus my relaxed mood.  Now all I have to do is hang up clothes and homework and I should have some time to chill tonight and watch some TV!!  I had to check out a book on the effects sex has on relationships for Marriage and Family class :OP but I ended up with a really interesting book.  Its on the Science of Relationships and Love.  Thats about all that happened today, nothin special, just kinda went by.  It's MONDAY MOVIE NIGHT ON LIFETIME though which is GREAT!!  

Those Winter Sundays
by Robert Hayden

Sundays too my father got up early
and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold,
then with cracked hands that ached
from labor in the weekday weather made
banked fires blaze.  No one ever thanked him.

I'd wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.
When the rooms were warm, he'd call,
and slowly I would rise and dress,
fearing the chronic angers of that house,

Speaking indifferently to him,
who had driven out the cold
and polished my good shoes as well.
What did I know, what did I know
of love's austere and lonely offices?

Dog's Death
by John Updike

She must have been kicked unseen or brushed by a car.
Too young to know much, she was beginning to learn
To use the newspapers spread on the kitchen floor
And to win, wetting there, the words, ""Good dog! Good dog!""

We thought her shy malaise was a shot reaction.
The autopsy disclosed a rupture in her liver.  
As we teased her with play, blood was filling her skin
And her heart was learning to lie down forever.

Monday morning, as the children were noisily fed
And sent to school, she crawled beneath the youngest's bed.
We found her twisted and limp but still alive.
In the car to the vet's, on my lap, she tried

To bite my hand and died.  I stroked her warm fur
And my wife called in a voice imperious with tears.
Though surrounded by love that would have upheld her,
Nevertheless she sank and, stiffening, disappeared.

Back home, we found that in the night her frame,
Drawing near to dissolusion, had entered the shame
Of diarrhoea and had dragged across the floor
To a newspaper carelessly left there.  Good dog.

**just wanted to share those I thought they were great, last one very sad, but great.**"

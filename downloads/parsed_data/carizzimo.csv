"event","Its Tuesday (Oct 8th) and this is my first journal entry. Last night i went to an open call at this modeling agency called Trans Continental Talent. aka TCT. But i ultimatly decided not to sign w/ them. I dont want to do modeling. I would rather do commercials, television, and movies. Plus... I cant travel all over the US for a gig. So no. But oh well. The search for a good agent in LA begins... this weekend. This Saturday is going to sux the big one... I can tell. I have the SAT (the real deal) at 8am. Im going to die. ugh. Today Mrs. Randels (Gov/Econ teacher) made Alexis cry. And she said shut-up to the class like 6 times. She had something major stuck up her butt. And my ex (DesForges) embarassed the hell out of me today. I was leaving skewll 5th period and he said ""What are u doing after school"" and i said ""ummm... watching a meiosis video""... it was not true of course. Its just a joke from Physiology class. Plus, I thought he didnt know what meiosis is. and he yells ""Ur gonna watch a porn!! Hell yea. Im there"" . So embarassing. i could have died. Everyone was lookin at me. ugh... i could just kill that kid sometimes. But what are Ex-boyfriends for n/e wayz. I know i should be more careful about who i date... but i have a problem with rushing into things. I get all emotionally attached before i know what hit me. I guess thats every girl to an extent. someone is IMing me. g2g. late"

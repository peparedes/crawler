"event","This weekend was fun,Friday i skipped with jo and alicia, and we went to the gym where i participated in a hip hop dance class, it was SO HARD i have so much more respect for jo.. she's amazing.And then alicia and i walked for 20 minutes and then we did thigh thingies, AND THEN we ran like 2 miles on piedmont. wow. i excercised. Later that night, alicia's party.. where she and i left and went to wendy's at 1 in the morning and ate chicken like animals in the car.. or i did... and then i went to sleeeeep early. For once i didn't drink, aren't you proud? Rhetorical question. And then saturday eva and i met up. Sexy sexy Eva. Rar. we went to CHili's and ate, got stuffed on some weird meaty cheese deep, and couldn't eat my chicken fingers. AFROOOZ joined us half way through.
THEN we decided to go bowling, my brilliant plan. i know i know. Thomas brought the socks and his wripped pants. Hot.  I was winning for the longest time until afrooz, the penis face, beat me in the end, and then i dunno what happened second game cause i just SUCKED BUTTTTT. 
I took eva home, and we got eachother sick and now i'm coughing like a hound and i hope you feel better eva. WHAAA. ps- major never called ME! boohoo
and now i'm screwed with school cause i suck beyond words, despite what my grades tell me. 
it's horrible having a cold and a nose piercing. i won't go into details. 
i'm craving sghetti'"

"event","I seriously planned on not doing any of my homework and going to sleep at like the early hours of 7. but first... america's next top model distracted me.. and then american idol got me.. and then alicia called.. and now i'm drawing pictures of Jen and talking to people online about numerous topics.  Gabe and i are planning on having babies cause he's a sex machine who's masculinity is so irresistible. 

I am planning on telling a certain someone a certain something on a certain friday night about a very certain .. CERTAIN interesting topic. certainly. 

There is seriously something lodged in my throat and i dunno what it is. it has been there since jo and i went shopping for BRAS at victoria's secret. Maybe it's lingerie that makes my throat aggravated.... WELL ATLEALST i got something from it. 

Eva is being a goddess and telling me how to deal with life problems. I loves you. 

Erica just said something to me in a different language, i don't quite know what she is talking about but i will nod and smile in return. 

Gabe prefers to call himself cocky instead of conceited cause the route word is cock which is latin for cockamous maximus, translation for, long penis. 

my butt is going numb and i can't feel my fingers. i wonder what i've been doing .. HARDY HAR HAR that's a knee slapper. maybe this is why Dan thinks i'm a dirty horny pervert. 

anyway goodnight. sleep well. dream of certain lovers that live in far off places that we can't exactly see every day. how sad. if u can relate.. leave me a comment"

Jo you're hot. hot. we won't talk about ANYTHING THAT happened. cause we don't do that.  and i cam home to find that i left all the food Whitney Alicia and i got from eatzi's in my room for two nights, and i was welcomed with the rankest smell i've ever sniffed in my entire life 
I hosed the room down with febreze and am plugging the nostrils as we speak. disgusting is all i have to say.
now i'm so tired cause i got about 4 hours of sleep in total... friday night i spent the whole night talking with lisa dan and.. kind of andrew. although i didn't talk much cause i get shy when i'm around hot indian men like dan . hahaha. and for the record i don't have a thing for him, i just think he's extremely good looking and fucking funny as hell. it's embaressing how much i laughed. 
I don't think i have any homework? i hope not. i'm waiting for alicia to get on so i can tell her everything.

"event","Wellll today i got my oral over with, and if i say so myself i thought it was quite good, except for me hyperventilating. I had been worrying about that crap for like 5 weeks! now i just have to re-write my english paper. WOOT WOOT

I didn't get caught for out of dress code with my large tinkerbell on my shirt, YAY!

So what did i do today...
This morning i was greeted with a pretty yellow rose from beautiful Eva, which made my day, then i spent a grueling hour in biology, god that class is satan's desire to kill me, and then another pain stakingly long hour of math with Ms. Pabutoy, where all i do is talk to Alicia and make the teacher mad.. i feel kinda bad, then BREAK! I rehearsed my oral like a mofo, then FUCKING A ENGLISH WAS SOOOOOO BADDD SOOO BORING. when i think of all the work to come for the rest of the year i want to jump off my balcony even if it is only like 3 stories high.  Then lunch, and then tok presentation, then history where i learned i had an A minus, delightful! Then i came home and saw connor from northsprings in my lobby, which was a bit freaky, tis a small world, he was with some big toothed idiot.. not to be mean or anything...THEN my prom dress came, my second one anyway, but i look like a fairy and i decided to keep my first one, Sigh. 
And my mom had cleaned-re organized, re-arranged my entire bedroom which is nice so now i don't live like a 20 year old man.

I'm exhausted and all i want to do is sleeeeeeeep!

BUT tonight is One tree Hill and American idol so that is superfragalistickmakesmealladoscious.

"event","Alright so what did i do last night? I believe I picked Julia up from school said hello to my few northsprings friends aaaaaaand went to tijuana joe's to eat QUESO AND CHIPS. where the waiter was sketchy and avoided eye contact with me and watched us dance to some international techno beats. Oonce Oonce Oonce *shakes head* THEN took Julia to the mall.. and on the way i find out SOMEONE thinks i wanted to hook up with her ex cause i was alllll over him on wednesday. which is the completele OPPOSITE! He was ALL OVER ME! and i refused it cause i was thinking of her. i'm a good friend, like i said before. 

Julia bought a shirt at Urban while i almost fell asleep who knows why. Drama makes me tired. Why am i always in drama? I'M NOT A DRAMA KINDA GAL. i like to be mellow. maybe i should become a hermit and never go out and be social again. Live in my room eating White turtle, getting fat and watching re runs of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. 

I think i just gained ten pounds eathing this White Turle ice cream.

i got gas by myself for the first time today.. and by gas i mean the stuff you put in your car... hardy har har

I wish i was able to go to the beach with Rachel. DAMMMMMIT!
tonight i am going out with friends which shall be fun. HOPEFULLY SOMEONE DOESN'T START A RUMOR THAT I'M A SLUT TRYING TO HOOK UP WITH HER RECENT EX. gosh. i don't do that. hfs;ljdfisjg

I have a lot of homework before the weekend is over, which is soon! my second spring break went by fast. sweet jesus. I have to prepare for two presentations re write a paper begin reseearch for art and something else i forget.

"event","So guys, i've decided to actually write in my live journal and join in the good fun with Julia..and no one else cause i don't know anyone else on here. I really don't know what to write about because i'm a boring old fart with no life, except partying and getting my ears sucked. Delicious. So i'm on my second spring break, that's write SECOND, count em biotch. Yesterday i went to a party at alicia's cause she's the party master and her parents are always out of town, props to them... and we got down like it was 1999.... or something or other. The Paris Hilton in me comes out when i'm intoxicated and i like to shake my non rhythmed bum on the pool table. So suck it. Or as rachel says.. that term is so male oriented.. let's be feminists and say ""eat out""....no comment
   So i was a good girl and didn't pounce the person i so very wanted to. I'M A GOOD FRIEND! even if he did suck on my ear for a good 5 minutes, which must rank as the top 5 best moments of my life. HA just exagerating, but if you are looking for a good ear satisfier, i'll give you his number.  I am actually urging or persuading my good ol friend the jules-meister to join an ear lovers club. want to join?
  Today i went shopping and spent basically all the money i've been saving up to travel to the Mother Country (england) i seriously think i need a new prom dress for that special day, i swear someone already has it, and there is this glorious one from betsey johnson. 
   I can predict my life in 10 years and it doesn't look pretty. I'm going to be fat, from beer-belly-idis, and i will waste all of my money on buying clothes way out of my budget, i will spend my weekends at the clubs and on sundays i will attend the ear loving foundation, i am the co-founder, along with Julia (yes you are apart of this destiney too, except minus the beer belly.. damn you). FOOK! It doesn't look bright.. but atleast i'll be happy ..hmmmm
    I'm just going to tell you all a little secret about my dear friend Julia, cause she's secretly a man. No.. i'm not kidding.. don't let the eyes deceive you, her willy is hidden between her legs and her boobs are made of RUBBER! Sorry Hulio (your true identity) i think it's time to come out of the closet about who you really are. 
   It's okay cause we are going to frolick in fields of chocolate brownies when we are older and you will puke after cause of your severe allergic reaction to about every food i can possibly think of, besides those jolly good reliable nuts!!! and bread?? And I will be fine cause i don't like chocolate. Wouldn't it be sick if there were fields of parmesan cheese. I think i'd die of repulsion. and god forbid fields of cotton balls. WAIT! there already are. MON DIEU! The crazy things that grow out of this earth.
 and branching out on the thought of Julia's random thought about chef hats. What if they grew out of the earth? Like seriously.. what is their purpose...I DON'T UNDERSTAND! maybe there is a secret well covered ventilating system sewn into the cloth that allows the chef's.. sweaty? head to get air. Or maybe they like to cover their bald spots, or maybe it's a trash can so they can flip the waste products of what they are cooking into the tall SHAFT of a hat. OH I GOT IT! maybe it's like a corvette or one of those long sports cars old men gowing through a mid life crisis get to make up for their small penises. IT'S A PENIS HAT!!!! everything in this world is falic(however you spell it. u know what i mean you dirty readers you)
anyway i'm getting out of hand and i need to go ....back to doing nothing?
cheerio

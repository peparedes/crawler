"event","as i lay dying in this pool of blood youll see me smiling, while looking into your eyes
saying goodbye in this kiss, saying goodbye in my mind only for you to hear, now i know
i can leave this world some day with one good thought on my mind, the thought of you
the thought of laying next to you, leaving all my hate and pain behind, no more tragic
thoughts


yah this is really  not about anybody,  i just felt like writing it"

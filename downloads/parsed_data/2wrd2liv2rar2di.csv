"event","this is a lot more complicated than the old, Xanga... why couldnt everyone just stay on there, it would have been so much easier, plus i've been on it like a year and a half, so i got attached. but why go on something if no one'll see it, eh?
Broo tickets are being delivered tomorrow, New rainbows too. i'm excited, i know everyone else is to. rainbows are the best flip flops in the world. i'd swear on that."

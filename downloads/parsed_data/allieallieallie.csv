"event","..I like hate school...im sick of drama...i wanna go to a different school...everyone says they hate drama...and then turn around and cause it??wtf people? Everyone at school fucked up Lynnhaven for each other...its everyones fault...everyone talks shit..even if they say they dont..i hate it..i cant stand it...i cant even tell if i have real friends.yeah they tell me they love me and im their best friend...but am i?? There are people who care about me and they know who they are but i mean come on. I see soo many LJ's that say they want the drama to go, well maybe if everyone stopped being 2 faced and shit then maybe it would stop and id have a reason to go to school every day. right now...im scared to go to sleep every night because im scared of what will happen the next day. This shouldnt happen. im confused about stuff. and i almost cant even stand it anymore. People who say shit, i dont even know if it comes back even harder on them, likes its supposed to...it doesnt seem like it bc it looks like everyone enjoys talking shit and alot of it...what is going on...give it a break for once...have fun...have real friends you can trust...if you stop...then maybe other ppl will too...im not saying that i dont talk shit because sometimes i do...but i mean what am i supposed to do..sit there and let people tell me shit that isnt true...for this whole thing to end everyone has to stop...and wow....rumors...electric toothbrush...not about me but about one of my good friends...wtf who would sit there and use a toothbrush...that is dicusting...and someone must fuckin have alot of time on their hands to come up with that shit..thats gross...i hope people know that that isnt true bc i no melissa anderson and she would never do anyhting like that. FUCK EVERYONE WHO CAUSES DRAMA AND MAKES LYNNHAVEN THE FUCKIN GAYEST PLACE ON EARTH..I HATE IT THERE..

wow i feel alot better, but am still hurting inside...<//33 allie"

"event","Uhh..i feel like my life is going to pieces..its probably my fault, i just dont no it. I try to live life at the fullest, but somebody always has to crush that. I wish everyone could cut this drama shit and have fun. So, would you rather go spred rumors about someone and make them feel bad, or go have fun...and no i dont mean fun as in go tell lies about someone and make people laugh at that certain person..i mean the kinda fun where you go run outside because you want to. go down to the beach just to put your feet in the sand. go somewhere youve never been just to find out whats there...that kind of fun...so...can you handle it???? i dont know about you guys but im ready to try it. Leave me some comments...tell me what you think or hit up my cell 6197373<3

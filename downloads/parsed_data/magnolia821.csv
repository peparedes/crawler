In other news, it's a beautiful day in a series of beautiful days, the writers union picnic is today and much merriment and rejoicing should occur. so i'm going to go be merry."

"event","what i've learned this week:

- ""Girl"" is a horrible movie
- I want to go to U.Penn. where's my money and secret genius-ness?
-Philadelphia is wonderful. Warren Haynes solo is wonderful. Prince is fucking amazing.
-Parties in Perry Hall are bearable if you've been drinking 
-I am done with Mt.Washington
-I need to find some more money.
- I should've read ""The Never Ending Story"" a long time ago....oh well, it's still good

Going to NYC tommorow, then the Dead/more Warren/the Bridge on Sudnay. Ran into Kenny in Philly...ahh, he pisses me off. but oh well, i'll see him again this weekend and luckily he'll be too busy playing a mandolin to say something stupid to me. 

lots of packing/shopping/seeing people to do. ahh! madness."

So last night was fun, went out and got free ice cream with mike, then dan and laurie randomly popped up and hung out here with us for the night. met a really cool guy who's going to washington--finally someone with good taste in music, hehe. next week is my version of a vacation-- can't afford to go away, but i'm going to an insane amount of shows.

August 9th (happy Jerry Garcia's birthday!)- Warren Haynes
August 10th- O.A.R. and Howie Day
August 12- Prince
August 14- Going to NYC
August 15- The Dead! and Warren! and The Bridge! awesomeness. 

after all this constant claire-at-the-office time, it'll be nice to go have a week of live music. yum. 

more dentist time tommorow. having my very first cavity filled. eww. but the dentist reminds me of bill cosby, which is cool. well, pre-crazy bill cosby. well, pre-openly crazy bill cosby. reminds me of that episode of family guy when stewie's on ""kids say the darndest things."" good times. ""i'm going to sit here and be quiet. and i like pudding.""

"event","i am so incredibly bored. i think mike needs to get off work and jamie needs to get back to baltimore and noura and laura need to have not gone to switzerland. crazy weekend of broken plans. mike and i were supposed to go see ""Badasss!"" after work on friday, but i was hungry and tired, so we went and got food. afterwards, we found out mike's tire was flat and walked all the way back to my house, which was shockingly really nice, except for my hair exploding (oh 'fro)and many cars almost running me over. but mike saved me :).
last night i was supposed to go see Big Boi with Sara and Simon. On the way there, Simon calls to say the show was canceled and Big Boi's bus had broken down in North Carolina. So in a flurry of complaining, we miss our exit and end up being lost for an hour and ending up in the middle of Dundalk. eek. but it was all good, spent about three hours talking to sara as we staked out the few places in owings mills that are open after, oh, 9:00 pm. ahh living in suburbia. went out to lunch with mike's family for his dad's birthday today and read more of ""Truck,"" which is amazing and has convinced me that i need to re-read ""Geek Love"" and really read it as opposed to skimming through it.

glen's still out of town, so i'm working like a maniac again this week so i can pay off these last few college-related payments, after which i will hopefully be way less stressed out. but i'm not all that stressed out now, for once, which is good. and i'm going fishing when i get to college. oh yeah. should be interesting."

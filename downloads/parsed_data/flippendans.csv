"event","I remember when I used to think I'd write in this thing everyday forever. 
and then I got a life
a busy busy life.


I really just wanted to update because I am so proud of myself for the following:

-I carved*(see below) and cooked a fish for dinner the other night and actually tried it! -for those of you that know me and my intense fear of fish should be smiling right now and mouthing the words ""way to go champ!"" in my general direction(which wherever you are, is probably north)

* I used the verb carved instead of the proper term filleted because in no earthly way can removing scaly skin from slimy flaky flesh and digging out rib cages with sharp little spindly fish bones whilst engulfed in the foul stench of fish itself be called something so dainty sounding as filleted. fuck filleted, that shit was carved all to hell. 

-Adam and I broke up, which sounds lame to say because it wasnt really breaking up it was just sort of like, hi ""boyfriend"" I never see you because I change diapers and you save lives being all firefightery and such, and it was a friendly parting, so for that I am proud (see history of my life on breakups)

-I am also proud because I finally asked out Devin, and he said yes! and he was all blushy and smiley and perfect and awesome and I dont ask out boys but I made an exception for this one on account that he's rather timid at times. SO BE EXCITED FOR ME and my forward pushy ways.

-I HAVE AN A IN MY ONLY COLLEGE CLASS, its probably because I actually attend it.

I also really wanted to update because I am absolutley horrified by the following:

-Big Mitch, My boss/Mentor, is in the hospital, and it could be bad. I don't have enough details and I dont feel like typing out what I do know except for that I'm sad, and really worried. 

-UAA Panhellenic just changed the GPA reqs for new members, so I might not get a bid this weekend which SUCKS, especially since the bonding is already done and like, ASA and I are in love. 

and this is something im horrified/proud of:

-first of all, I got a bunny, Oliver(see facebook pics) he might be the sweetest thing ever(except when he bites on accident) but Coni loved him so much she bought one too, (another boy, Todd) AND OLIVER TOPPED TODD!!!!!! AHHH, my bunny is gay. i have mixed feelings. its like, I always thought I would love to have a gay son, but the reality of actually having a gay son(bunny) feels much different.


ok by for another long period of time

SNOW IS COMING SOON YAYYYYYAAAAA!!!!"

"event","hello all,

I feel the tight grip I once held my livejournal with slowly slipping away into the black abyss that is my past. However, since I am on vacation, I surely cannot pass up the temptation to update you all on my life's comings and goings.

in the words of Coni, my sister, my teammate, my mother, my best friend(one of them) ""I feel like this is how everything should be, this is the way it is supposed to happen, this is the life we are supposed to be living.""

I am in California. We've come down for the Mid-State Fair and to be with Coni's grandmother on her death bed. It's been a whirlwind of emotions down here. Being with someone at the end of their life is an overwhelming and moving experience. I feel like I should be writing a novel based on the experiences I have lived through with these people, all of whom, consider me family. I just can't even say. 

Coni and Teri and I bought Tarot cards and gave each other readings the other night which were shockingly accurate.

Naomi is just perfect. How can anyone consider her a job. this is way more than that.

Coni took me to see Larry the Cable Guy on my birthday, not my initial idea of a good time, but ended up being greatttt fun. Probably because everyone in attendance reminded me so much of Georgian white trash, something I have almost come to miss...almost. The next day she and the whole family threw me a barbeque and we had a huge ansley cake and played games and swam and stayed up late outside under the stars, it was the best birthday I've had since I was a little kid. We rode rides at the carnival and I got to see Velvet Revolver from the Ferris Wheel and i love me some Cali. probly the highlight was winning a goldfish from the fair.

I'm missing Adam, which is a good thing, I am excited to be back in Alaska and pick up where we left off. There is no other way to describe him, a gentleman.

I'm coming home Labor day weekend. I'll be there from wed-tues but I'll be at my farm with my fam fri-mon, call me if youre interested in hanging out. I reallly miss mezzo.

so, I start college on the 28th, I see my family that weekend, annnnd I'm starting up a new job on the weekends in Alaska!!! I am going to teach singing lessons with Big Mitch!!! Thats like, a huge confidence booster!!! so training fr that has been fun.

but right now, I am just loving all that is my life, and California, and sleeping in every morning until 10:30. and being with people I can call family.


and as for my real family, i just am so blessed.

miss you all, love you all, I hope you are all happy."

"event","Hi, so life isn't always cotton candy filled in Alaska.

This has been a very emotionally challanging week.

About a month ago I realised that there would be absolutley no physical or mental way that I could continue living for two years without my breast reduction. It has been put off for too long and I can't wait until I leave this job to have it done, so I disscussed it with The Wells family and the Gwinn family and we agreed to start planning my mammoplasty surgery in Alaska. 

Only thing is, my insurance ends July 31st, 2 days after I turn 19. Because I no longer live with my family, and I am not a full-time student, I can no longer be claimed under my parent's insurance, which means I would have to have completed the operation before July 15th, before my coverage ends(we are leaving for California on the 27th and I have time to heal before we fly).

So it began, the rush to find a doctor, a good alaskan cosmetic surgeon. We found her. Dr. Sarah C Troxel MD. The most qualified surgeon speciallizing in breast surgery in Alaska. In order to even schedule a consultation with her, I had to be issued a referral by another doctor, which can take weeks, sometimes even months. You have to go through an entire process of physical tasks to prove indeed that you are in need of this surgery( I MEAN IS IT NOT ALREADY OBVIOUS?) this is where living with a chiropractor comes in handy. Dr. Wells wrote me the referral and sent it to Dr. Troxel confirming my diagnosis of macromastia, saying that I was a candidate for the procedure.


and then..... Dr. Troxel's office calls giving us our next task, get pre-certified for the surgery through our insurance company. Normally the surgeons handle this themselves with the insurance company's but since my process had to be fit in by next month, they suggested we handle it and skip the extra time-consuming tasks. Long story short.

denied coverage.


Cigna insurance does not cover any medical expenses for me in Alaska except for emergancy procedures, they would however cover me in Georgia, but there isnt enough time to fly home have the surgery, heal, and fly back before the 15th, or even before the 31st.


so here are the options:
My parents and I pay the $10,000 out of our pockets.
Or I pay $300 a month for individual insurance plan that will cover the surgery
Or I become a full time(30 hr/wk) employee for Dr.Well's Chiropractic office(receptionist) so that I can be included on their employee's insurance rate.


If my parents pay, I would no longer be getting the car they owe me.
If I pay $300 for insurance, it will pretty much destroy my savings account.
If I work for the wells, on top of my nanny schedule, college, study time, and sleep (yes i calculated this all) I will have apx. 19 hrs free time on sundays to actually spend time doing stuff other than listed above.

45 hours/week nannying
30 hrs/week working
60 hrs/week sleeping(i wish)
3 hrs/week class time
6 hrs/week study time(yeah....i say that now)

144 hrs total

168 hrs in a week

which leaves 24 free hours which I can fit 5 in on sat, and the other 19 sun.

it's a good thing I only have 3 friends up here

so much for community theater!!!!

oh yes, I am enrolling as a part time student at UAA this fall.

im singing the anthem at the Alaska Pilots baseball game on fathers day! wish me luck with that


...and life in general."

"event","so I'm sick.

like really sick. and it's not the normal cold-like symptoms, it's like the been having strange symptoms for going on a month such as extreme dizziness, body aches, head aches, nose bleeds, my ears bleed?, paleness, fatigue, scary, cancer potential type of sickness. I've taken the past two days off work and I'm scheduled for the doctor tomorrow. I've never been this scared for my health before, my body is like shutting down on me. It's overwhelming.

I had a dream last night that I had a brain tumor and the cost to keep me employed under the Wells family was too much of a risk if I were going to be dying soon, so they very politely arranged for me to be a nanny for another nice family who would be living at my family's farm. So I was all upset and hurt and sick but decided to be professional about it and went to work for the other family. I woke up crying because i just wanted to be with the wells again! I told Coni about it this morning and she just hugged me for like 20 minutes and assured me I would always be welcome to work for them and i certainly have no brain tumors.

I've been reading the Da Vinci Code(finally) it's intense, and obviously cryptic, but i've been subconsciously applying codes to everything in my daily activities because i've completely immersed myself in the text. it's getting a bit extreme.


fun fact: adam rapp, anthony rapp's(RENT's mark) straight brother, is the creative consultant for my favorite television show, the L word, which happens to be all about this group of homosexual women. In Anthony Rapp's biography 'Without you"" which I just read in Hawaii, he writes of his brother and how he wrote screenplays and produces stuff and such and also about how he dealt with Anthony's sexual orientation. I wonder if Adam Rapp's brother's homosexuality had any influence on his involvement in this show. side note:trans genders are creepy. speaking of the l word, I just bought the complete 1-2&3 seasons off ebay for nothing from hong kong(full english) they havent all been released in the states yet so im pretty excited about it, i go them today and it's helped with the bedridden boredom of sickness. so you should all be jealous that you dont have the third season like me! well, i dont think anyone besides me and candace watches the l word, but whatever. im excited.

now drumroll please.........
I have planned a visit with a University of Alaska Anchorage admissions representative next week to discuss my plans for enrolling for this upcoming fall semester. I actually consider myself responsibly ready to attend school seriously. So I'll be a full time nanny and a part time college student.

and yes, this means i could be staying here longer

and yes, this means I am no longer sure if IADT is where i will be attending in Tampa

and yes, I have no fucking clue what i want to do with my life, but i'm so happy, driven, and clear headed its disgusting


I have this friend, she works at the grocery store and her name is stephani, she rings me up every tuesday when i go do the family's shopping and we have this whole conversational update everytime. ""how are things in the nanny world, ans?"" (i update) ""how are things in the engagement world?"" (she just got engaged shortly after i met her, and she updates) We've been having thes weekly installment rituals since about the third week I lived here so we finally exchanged numbers and have decided to actually talk outside the local fred meyer. So  go home and tell coni about it and the next day she tells me that brent went to the store and was so impressed with his cashier's nice smile and costumer service that he offered her a job to come work for his chiropractic office as the new receptionist, low and behold it was stephani!! she couldnt believe that she was offered a job by her fave grocery shopping nanny's boss! So now she is going to work for the wells too and if everything works out she might be coming on the annual staff trip next year with us( I think it might be Israel GASP!) i just love it when aweosme stuff happens.

I am so fortunate to have this life with amazing friends back home who constantly remind me that no matter how far away I am they will always be just a phone call away and awesome friends up here who are making me feel more and more at home each day. I have a life, an amazing job, success, and I have TWO amazing families to share my life with. I live in the most beautiful place I've ever seen and I constantly have to remind myself that this is my job.

Coni sat me down for a talk tonight in which she told me how proud she was of me for everything I've done and how much she loves me as a person and as her nanny. It's been a bit hard for her now that I've been making more friends and (drumroll please......) actually dating real human men(who knew that was possible?) She told me that I've become a daughter figure for her here and she wants to make sure that I know she trusts me to make good choices and that she loves me for it. Although it kind of sounds like she's putting parental restrictions on me, it's not like that, I would never dream of doing anything to dissapoint her and she knows that, she just wanted me to know that she misses me now that I'm out more, but she knows I'm safe and responsible. I never expected that I would grow a mother-daughter relationship with an actual employer of mine, but she is my mom away from mom, although there is no comparing the two, I am just soooooooo happy to have Coni in my life.


I've started to get involved in the community, I have a theater audition coming up and I've been taking voice lessons with this insane man whom I also love. And I've been spending a lot more time up at the farm, Mrs. Perkins took me up to Palmer for the Stallion parade and it was awesome, Palmer is definatly one of the most breathtaking places I've ever visited.

ugh, i dont want to jinx anything. so i will wait for the next update to shower you with more giddyness."

"event","So, Coni, Naomi, Claire, Colton, and I, ansley-wondernanny-gwinn, made the journey down to Cali monday night. You try holding a baby for a 5 hour flight(thank geez it wasn't a crying baby)

anyways-  Southern California is awesome, just like everyone says. It doesn't feel like I'm in America it has a very Aukland, New Zealandish vibe and tons o farm land which makes it cooler. It has rained only once but has been a bit chilly but I like it best this way, now that I am acclaimated to below freezing wheather. 

We drove from LA down to San Lois Obispo, which is where I am staying right now in this quaint little farm house with sheep and such, and deer in the front yard as opposed to moose. It's been amazing. So far we have dined at the Carlton Hotel which is this really awesome restored place in Atascadero, and yesterday we went to the famous Madonna inn, a fabulously gaudy landmark where David Arquette and Courtney Cox were married. 

   Coni's sister is the administrater for an alzheimer care facility and she and coni's grandmother 'Dot' is one of her residents at one of the homes. Dot is on her last couple weeks so we are throwing her a borthday party this saturday the big 8-6!!! This is the whole reason we have come here. So the past two days I've been painting with people who can't remember my name and hugging these amazing amazing people and spending time with them and it's one of the more awesome things I can say I have ever done. Today I was talking to this man named Dave who sits in his chair and holds his saxaphone in his arms like a baby and sings the most beautiful songs. Teri told him I sang and he played the piano and we sang Frank together and I just cried. I could just picture this man in a white sports coat on a yaht somewhere singing amazing jazz tunes and flirting with younger women at the bar. You can just tell he was a total pimp before he started forgetting who his family members were.
   And then there is Gunnar who can only says 'okay' to everything ""Gunnar, what are you eating?"" ""okay!"" but he is so cute, and he is so nice and smiley and he showed me all these pictures when he was young and they are the black and white ones and all nice and classy and perfect.
   And another woman Libby, insisted on holding my hand the entire day, I had a rather hard time laving her behind. 

It's just overwhelming. I have total respect for nurses who can put on a happy face and take care of people like that all day long. As depressing as it is, it is so rewarding to put a smile on these people's beautiful old faces. think 'the notebook'

Tomorrow after the party, we are driving up to Santa Barabara where we will be spending the rest of our trip. I will try and keep you posted.

mucho love."

"event","i noticed this fun fact whilst cooking dinner this evening.

first things first in this jam-packed updated entry, my dream last night:
fire alarm broke again so i had to sleep with beeping, so in the measly 4 hours I did manage to doze, I had a dream that I had moved to Alaska with my cousin Natalie to attend college. Catherine Moore was in 2 of my classes, but refused to talk with me because she had to concentrate on studies. Meredith Kelly was also there, I think she was working there? So we all went to chick-fil-a in Alaska and Lauren Coffey was working the drivethru in the alaskan chick-fil-a! So, naturally, Lauren took her lunch break and she, natalie, meredith, and I disscussed how crazy it was that we actually moved to alaksa! I mean who does that!??!?!

and then i woke up.

yesterday was a good day, I slept late and then went to the mountains to take pictures, I hiked a bit in the Chugatch Mountains in this park that was unbeleivable(pics later) I took some pictures of the sunset over the ocean with the mountains and then I was like ""hey, I should go to the beach right now""

so i did, and I drove 20 minutes away from the mountains to the beach and I found the hotel I stayed in in my first trip to alaska. I got excited. and then I lost my drivers license, debit card, and my blockbuster card so i started freaking out and I told God I promised to be a beleiver if he would help me find my id case, and I found it so now I beleive in God.

So I totally went to the beach, AND the montains in one day, all within an hour. and dont forget my religious experience!

so then i came home and sliced my finger open with scissors hanging pictures around my awesome room.

Today was not a good day. 

I was given a new schedule made by the bitch ass grandmother, that basically has everything listed that i already do everyday with certain things underlined or in bold print with an obnoxious amount of exclaimation points just incase im retarded. ex: BE ON TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and like DON'T LEAVE THE STOVE ON!!!!! or WASH YOUR HANDS!!!!!!!!! and bascially i was insulted.

so I'm sitting there having this read to me by coni, and i notice that SHE IS WEARING MY FUCKING SHIRT! I mean what the hell do I do? ummmm, boss, can I have my shirt back!???!!?!?! wtf!? so i just kind of stared at the oil spot on the boob that proved that it was mine and knodded in agreement to whatever she was saying and then walked away.

I called my mom and she got really upset that I was having a bad day and started crying, so that made me feel worse, so then I called candace and talked about her breakup with alicia and i felt better, im glad she is finally getting free of this mess.

I was still upset and pissed at the fucking retarded schedule and i picked up the iron by the wrong side and burnt the cut on my finger from the scissors. 

So then I got the song 'when i was 17' by frank sinatra stuck in my head, and i got really sad because it makes me think of my dad dying, and then i got really sad because frank sinatra already died.  

SO I STARTED CRYING. I havent cried really since ive been here, and i start crying over frank sinatra. what the hell is wrong with me?

and then, after dinner, a baby projectile vommited on me. so i cleaned it and the couch and changed it, and then i took a shower and a long bath and now i am here trying not to think about frank.

"event","So today I got own3d by snow. 

Here is the story.

I took a hike in our backyard, because our backyard is a forest and it's the size of the east cobb park. I took my camera and decided to take pictures. so I begin my walk and bust ass more than expected, but oh well. I took some really pretty pictures but I kept sinking pretty low in the snow the further I walked. I thought the snow would be more shallow if I stayed under the trees because they block most of the snow fall and not as much snow would build up under them. RETARDED. all the snow fell off the trees which any alive person would notice, I guess I was just thinking it melted and evaporated or some crazy shit. So I keep walking and I'm like ""man, this snow is really deep it's like all the way to my calves, wow"" BAM. I sink thigh deep in snow. So I was like, oh silly ans, and i took some pictures of me thigh deep in snow and then i dropped my camera in the snow, which sunk about 2 feet down. That was cool. So then I decide I should climb out of this little hole I've made. So, I force my foot out of it's deep crevace in the snow and put it back down in a different spot thinking I will just be able to step out of the mess. no, my other foot sinks. so I'm like, cool, I'll just climb out with my hands and pull myself out. No, hands sink too. so I basically had to wallow around in 4 ft snow to get to higher ground. 

when I did I noticed animal tracks. bunny tracks, moose tracks, and freaking wolf tracks. Brent went out and showed me each of them and verified that these were indeed the right animals.

so then I got the hell out of there.

cool.

I made a friend!!! Her name is Shauna and she loves moulin rouge and is pretty rockin, she is taking me to this place called bear tooth and it's a movie theater but a restaraunt too and it's like $3, so I'm excited. Her bf is a dj for a local club but I am trying to avoid that scene whilst living here, and she is totally understanding. 
I'm really happy.

I bought fabric today for the tutu I'm sewing for Naomi, I'm really excited about getting started on it. Coni has an old sewing machine that she has been letting me use so I don't have to buy one here! sweet action. I'm taking some pattern making classes with one of coni's friends, Tess. She is like, the coolest lady ever. She's a lot like Cindy Curtis, my mom's bff. I'm finding more and more things that make me feel at home here. Today I made sweet tea. It was glorious. I forgot how much I need that to live.

I got lost in the mountains yesterday, kind of. I just wanted to drive up a bit to take some cool pictures and the higher I went I kept trying to remember the turns I had made, oops. 

30 minutes later, I made it down the mountain before dark. It was scary. and beautiful.

last night I took naomi to a suprise dinner and a movie! I freeking love her. Now I understand why parents spoil their children.


cheers for being happy


i will be yours truly if indeed the price is right."

it's 9:33pm and I'm lying in my lavishly decorated room searching for uncomplicated recipies on epicurious.com. cooking.....I want to say sucks, but it does'nt. I suppose the best word would be challenging. The actual cooking process is ok, sometimes I fuck up, sometimes I have fun with it. Everything I've made so far has been either just ok or really good, nothing disgusting(one time I over-cooked Halibut so badly I could'nt serve it, but I was secretly pleased because I don't eat fish) It's the finding meals to make that is horrid. It's like outfits, you don't wear the same thing every night and God forbid if you repeat and outfit within a month! I don't want to serve them the same food over and over again, but after cooking 5 nights a week, thats gonna get difficult.

I just studied a map of Anchorage and then drew my own interpretation with icons of places I go in the city and I found short-cuts to try out and roads to take me into the mountains and to the beach. There are about 4398247 lakes in Anchorage, which is a lot for such a small city, and there is a park pretty much right next door to my house. who knew?! I shall explore more this weekend.

Fire Alarms.
fuck fire alarms. The fire alarm outside my bedroom door had a dead battery and when it gets dead batteries it beeps a very loud harsh beep every 25 seconds (I counted) Brent and I tried to fix it last night but we couldn't so we tried to take it down but we couldnt because it's wired into the house. So until an electrician came today, every 25 seconds was disturbing. You can imagine how well I slept last night...

I watched the entire 2 seasons of the L-word on dvd (compliments of the best blockbuster ever) in a 2 week period after Candace convinced me to check it out. Holy crizznap, what an effing good show. Not for the homophobic. It's really amazing. I'm officially addicted. Now I must subscribe to showtime.

speaking of tv. CARA FINALLY GOT VOTED OFF PROJECT RUNWAY!!!! my ideal top 3 would've been Nick, Daniel, and Andre/Chloe (either one) I don't think Santino deserves to be where he is, he did some great stuff in the beginning but the judges gave him too many chances. Iwanted to cry when Nick left, and I was also very upset when Andre did as well, they both should've been there longer. ugh. and last episode just blew, I didn't like any of the dresses. They all looked like they were from David's Bridal or Riche's-Macy's, except in Santino's case, his looked like it was from the Walton drama prop room. gross.
oh well.


Naomi fell off the playground swing-set thing at school today and bumped her head so we went to wal-mart and bought a pegasus barbie sticker set. she's all better. We both wore are hair in pig-tail buns today to match and she wore this shirt I bought her a couple weeks ago. She's so stinking cute. She makes an amazing little sister, not as cool as Kaley though.

I've made $2,000 already. Let me think about that.....wtf? And I've also started restenting the G-ma....oops! 


I miss sweet tea."

"event","The most insane thing just happened.

Coni found a letter adressed to me that had been dropped on the front porch and never made it inside. It was from my dad.
a real, live, kind-hearted, fatherly letter from Mitch Gwinn. I was like shaking when I opened it. It was really nice, just saying how happy he was for me and talked about the weather there, stuff any normal father would say. He has gorgeous penmanship and it was written on his personal embossed stationary which I have never seen before. It was such a pleasant suprise. I was suppose to recieve it two weeks ago, but I'm glad I got it on valentine's day. An unexpected show of love.

Valentine's day was awesome, Naomi kind of asked me on short notice(yesterday) if I would please be her valentine, after some pretty persuasive attempts, I assured here I had no other plans and agreed. Who knew I would one day have a 4-yr old valentine in Alaska? So, her preschool class had a valentine tea party and she made me a card and a fruit parfait and it was a lot of fun. It's amazing how mature kids make you, you would think you would be wollering on the floor with them(don't get me wrong I sometimes do) but just being responsible for someone so small and eager to learn about life makes me feel ancient, things I normally think are funny are now crude and inappropriate and the harshest word that remains in my vocabulary is darn(and that is only in serious cases!) No drugs, no peircings, no sex, no alchohol. This is serious business, and it's the most clear-headed I've been since I can remember. refreshing really


and cheers to mike yin for making me laugh with a very strange online valentine! have a good one yin!

and Happy Valentine's day to everyone else!

much love"

I got sick. sucks. I took my first day off today and have been on a strict medication schedual. gross. 

The weather has been pretty crazy here, one day it rains and turns the snow to slush, and then it's 40 degress outside, which means I can walk outside in a t-shirt, and last night the temp dropped again and it snowed another 2 feet.

wtf?

Because I am sick, I didn't have to cook dinner tonight, so the g-ma did, dinner was good and we had parsnips? I've never had them before....it's an experience.

I'm saving up for a sewing machine so I can start working on my porfolio scetches and making them into real functional clothes. It's exciting. I feel so much more inspired here. I've been looking into a lot more interesting things to do with my time. I start my art class next month, I'll be getting involved in theater soon, and I'm looking into the coolest thing ever.....fencing lessons. yeah. I am enjoying myself. There is something so thrilling here, I just feel like this completley transformed individual. it's really comforting.

so I finally have the internet, and it's been awesome, so this means I have pictures for you. enjoy.

"event","GAH! I LOVE ALL OF YOU!

thanks for all the comments filled with love and support, it made me a bit homesick, but in the best kind of way! 

So, I had my first bad day last week, only because Naomi had a complete emotional meltdown, but hey, I would too if I was 3 years old and my mom had two new baby twins and I wasn't the center of the universe anymore, so it was a huge ordeal and it made me sad.

The thing is, I have really become one in the family. I've been here for three weeks today, but we've all said it feels like years. I've just melted into this setting and although I am very much a georgian gwinn, I have just become Alaskan. It's all a part of moving I suppose.

Since I am a part of this family now, I look at my work as 'pulling my weight.' Keeping the house clean and cooking dinners is just my purpose in the home. My shifts are mon-fri 8-5 but I end up working full time anyway just because I might as well wash the dishes if they are dirty anyway, you know? It doesn't feel like an extra load or I'm going out of the way, as long as I'm home and I'm not doing anything else I might as well work. Coni and Brent think I'm a work-a-holic

so on my bad day(which happened to be my pay-day!) I came home to a suprise. A sushi dinner! They ordered my favorite food! It was amazing. And thenthey handed me an envelope with a $50 gift certificate to an art supply store and a list of classes to sign up for and they are paying for my enrollment into the one I choose. It took all the strength I had to keep from crying. How completely perfect can these people be!?! it's just not normal!

Yesterday was the shower, it was my first baby shower and I've never felt more like a mini-van driver in my life mingling with mothers whose daughters attend school with Naomi and whose favorite topic of conversation is the brand of formula they use to nourish their offspring. But, it was a suprisingly good time. I bought the babies pink and blue snow booties and Naomi and I made some pretty art for the nursery. Coni loved it!

everything is going well, Naomi is still having a hard time but she will be ok. Ugh, she is such an awesome kid. 

It's the g-ma's b-day today so we are all going out to a nice fancy dinner(with 3 kids?) we will see how that works out!

and I'm off to the art store!

.LOVE.


let's fall just like you said into some forgotten sea with the envy and the hate, spinning round' in figure eights, spinning round' in figure eights"

"event","ok, for those of you who are interested, here lies a full detailed update of ""the life alaskan""(copyright Laura Bowers)

I left for Heartfeild airport early sunday morning Jan. 15th with my mom and dad. I was to move to Alaska for one year to become a nanny for a family whom I had never met in person and had only spoken with through e-mail and telephone calls. My mom had been an emotional wreck that whole month as soon as she understood I was really leaving. We grew so much closer after I graduated, it was very hard to leave her. Kaley and I had said our goodbyes that morning before I left and Candace and Alicia even drove to my house at 3 in the morning to see me off. Who knew it would be my dad that would make me cry? He walked me in and helped me with my bags and when it was time for him to leave I lost it. He told me he loved me more than I knew and to have a great adventure. After that I was one of those pathetic strangers you see walking through the terminal squeaking and sniffling as the public stared in pity. gross.

The flights were long and the lay-over was even worse. I met a woman on my second flight from st.paul minnesota(MARSHALL!) to Anchorage named Beth. She is the local community theatre director in ancorage and I was given her email adress so that I can audition in my free time. I also shared the flight with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Hockey team. Needless to say, it was an interesting flight.

Dr. Brent Wells(chiroprator) and 3-yr-old Naomi greeted me with beautiful flowers and a sign that said welcome Ansley! This little girl and I have been attached at the hip ever since. Driving 'home' to their very very very large house in the mountains, I experienced some major culture shock. White. EVERYTHING IS WHITE!!!!! like, thick sparkly powdery snow everywhere! you can't see the green under the trees or even what color some cars are, its all just snow. When we got home, I was given a grand tour of the house(which I am in charge of cleaning)and a gift! A columbia fleece scarf, hat, headband, and gloves! I was shown my room, or my apartment I should say. I live in the first floor with my own bedroom, bathroom, mini-kitchen, and entertaiment center. Outside my backdoor is the jacuzzi and the most amazing veiw of the mountains. beautiful. I decorated my room with moulin rouge, harry potter, liz phair, and narnia posters(of course) and my bed is even more comfortable then the one in Georgia(a huge feat). 

Coni and Brent are my bosses and they instantly welcomed me into their family. At our first dinner they made it clear that they wanted me to be comfortable here, like a big sister to Naomi, and like another daughter to them. Easy! considering I absolutley adore this family. There is no fighting, occasional bickering over stupid things which I find humorous, and they constantly praise me on my work around the house and with Naomi. Naomi and I do get along perfect, she is no challenge and listens to me and she is not one of those kids who are soooo annoying to play with. She's hilarious. I hate it when she goes to school, I miss her too much! 

My duties in the house include light housekeeping, cooking for the family(which is the hardest thing so far) and taking Nomes back and forth from school and gymnastics, and swimming, and ballet. I've made a few friends with some other moms and nannies of nomies friends so i'm not completley isolated yet! I've met one girl my age so far. But I really have'nt had time to be lonely or bored. Even if I were to met people here, everyone just compliments me on my beautiful daughter, ""I'm her nanny, but thanks."" yeah, apparently I'm a mom now.

So Coni was pregnant with twins, due Feb. 7th for a c-section. I would not be responsible for them, I am only Naomi's nanny. I was so excited to have babies in the house! I've never really wanted children of my own but I decided to use this experience to see if maybe I would someday. Anyway, they were supposed to come in feb. change of plans. The two beautiful pre-mature but healthy twin babies, Colton Wade, and Claire Marie, were born this past thursday. I can't beleive I'm actually holding one when they are in my arms, it feels like in just holding a warm blanket. They don't seem like people, more like puppies or dolls, but they are amazing. Im absolutley in love. I'm still not sure I want ones for myself after i've seen what coni has gone through to have them, but I just love holding them!

It is'nt unbearable cold up here, one day it was, but most of the time it's a nice dry snowy cold and I love going outside. I miss everyone a lot, but I've only gotten homesick once or twice. Mom calls crying a lot. I don't think she'll ever let me move out! So far I've seen one moose, to bald eagles, and about 673670000 Ravens the size of small dogs. no squirrels.It is definatly a job caring for a family and cleaning and grocery shopping and cooking and DRIVING IN THE SNOW! But its fun, and it does'nt feel like work. 

I wake up most mornings first thinking, ""I really live here?"" and then ""I'm actually getting paid for this?!?""

come visit! 
love and kisses, your inuit friend"

moving is harder than i thought it would be. I have a fever. I'm running out of time to see people, including my family. And Liz Phair was dropped from capitol records, which may mean she won't be releasing anymore albums, which means there is not much point of me having ears anymore. What are they good for if I can't hear Liz Phair?! It would be like if J.K. decided not to finish the 7th book, I would have to pull out my eyeballs because they would be good for nothing if they couldnt read the rest of harry potter's adventures, and then I would have to kill myself because let's face it, I'm worthless if I don't have closure.


I think I'll have closure when I leave here?


I saw memiors, it was really good, except for the part where they left out her 1st danna, and when they set the nitta okiya on fire(that doesnt happen in the book, Hatsumomo's friend Korin's okiya catches fire instead) and they didnt make Nobu cool enough, in the book Chiyo(Sayuri) and Nobu are pretty tight before she fucks the general, and they barely had granny in it. oops!

otherwise, moving and beautiful and pretty accurate. I cried. maybe it's because im emotional and worn out and sick? or i was just soooo happy in the end.

I can't wait to meet the love of my life, I hope it's asap so I can spend as many years with them as possible."

last night was fun.

I have been blessed with bitching parties the past two New Years.
I think this one takes the cake, probly because I didnt make a drunken ass out of myself, but I did make out with some pretty hott people. So happy new year to that. I cant wait till next year and my homecoming!

and I really like Casey Tatum, how come i didnt know she was so awesome? she would give up her virginity in new york! and laura cried. and garland cried. and candace cried, but we love them. and laura danced?

and i just laughed. 

and i love you.

and then people drunk dialed me 4 times while i was in the same house as them, people being laura.

thanks bing for having us!

there were a ton of people there. wow. that was a perfect night with kids before i leave. yay!

this entry sounds really high schooly -deal with it.

i hope garland lives. i love her."

"event","so, my room is growing emptier by the minute. 

For the few of you who have actually seen my room, you can tell by the mounds of mystery shoved in all corners that I have never thrown anything of even remote sentimental value away since kindergarten. You can imagine that packing all of this up and organizing and cleaning has been quite the challenge. 


especially since <b>I am now leaving on the 15th</b> instead of the 21st.


I keep finding things like old fan-o-grams and pictures and notes and countless other peices of my life scattered in random places such as my closet or jewelry boxes and other dust infested corners of this infinate abyss I call my room.


and I decided, I love you. I love each and everyone of you. I even love the people I hate. I love the people I barely know and the people who broke my heart. Georgia has been a really amazing place for me to have grown up and without all of you who I am reminded of in these pictures and notes and yearbooks, I would in no way be myself. and I kinda like being Ansley.


I will miss it here.

"event","<font color=""CC0066""><lj-cut text=""omg....tears of absolute joy"">Hi,

I got a call from Kathy today and she was very nice.  She had wonderful things to say about you.  I also got the background check back and it had nothing to report, which is good.</font>

<b>I'd like to officially offer you the position and say I'm excited to meet you in person!!</b>

<font color=""CC0066"">I was thinking of getting your ticket for around Jan 21st, give or take a few days if that would work for you.  Which airport do you normally fly out of?  Just to let you know, flying to Anchorage takes a long time and is exhausting, so we'll give you a couple of days to get rested and settled in your room.  We can talk about things to bring when we talk again.

Well, everything is looking good.  In fact, I may go into labor when you get here, so things may be a little hectic, but we'll all be ok!!  I'll have to stay in the hospital a few days, but Alisha (our current Nanny) and my Mom will be here to help you.

Email me if you have any questions and let me know if the dates work for you.

Thanks so much and have a great night!!

Coni Wells</lj-cut>

To those people I am sorry if I offended you. 
My comments and updates were not directed to any one particular person.
There was not just one person saying the things that I commented on. 
There were many people and many of those people did not give a valid reason as to why they were concerned. 
To me it seemed and still seems like they do not support certain decisions. 
I appreciate everyone's input as far as their concerns with decisions being made.
I just have to ask that if you are going to have a concern be a little more specific as to your reasoning. 
If there are events that you want to use as a reference and don't want everyone to see it you can e-mail me at red_rosechick@yahoo.com
I don't want to offend anyone by putting this on here.
I just want people to know that if you simply put some concern to me without validating it, then I won't read it. 
It won't seem like anything important enough for me to consider.
I will be leaving Southside, but not because I want to. 
I am leaving Southside because God has been laying it on my heart for quite some time now to leave the church.
I just was being stubborn about it until recently. 
I know that I should not have ignored what God has laid on my heart, but I did.
It just makes it all that much harder to leave Southside because I love all the people there. 
I am going to miss everyone and I mean that with all my heart. 
I barely knew Isha and Kayleigh when they left, but I still miss them every day. 
I will truely miss everyone at Southside, but I can not ignore God's calling in my heart any longer.
I have put it off for far too long already, but I will occassionally go back to visit Southside to see how everyone is doing. 
I love the family that I have gained from Southside, but God's calling is just too strong for me to ignore any longer."

"event","for those of you who now know about Matthew and me, guess what? We talked to Pastor Jim with the Ellettsville First Assembly of God. He brought to surface some of the concerns that have been on both Matthew's and my mind. We have both finally come out and told each other that we both think it would be best and want to wait a year to get married. Now get it over with bring on the ""I TOLD YOU SO"" that any of you want to say. We are not saying that anyone in particular would want to say that other than all of our family so far. We both knew it was for the best a long time before anyone actually told us, but we just did not want to admit it to anyone else. However, this engagement ring is NOT coming off of my finger. I love the people at Southside Christian Church, but now God is calling me away from the church and to the Ellettsville First Assembly of God. He has a different purpose for me now than he did almost a year ago. I will be there the next couple of Wednesday nights for the Building a Biblical Marriage class and then I will have to pull away from Southside and move to Ellettsville First Assembly of God because that is what God has been laying on my heart for me to do for quite sometime now. Well I am going to go now. See ya later."

Please be happy for us and don't try to talk us out of it because if you do then you are no better than any non believers who seem to not care either. Any ways got to run. Really tired from Friday night-Saturday morning when a certain someone kept me up all night. I am really sleep deprived and going to get up early tommorrow too.

"event","I had a series of crazy dreams last night. 

The first dream I had was that my mom came to visit me over at grandpa's house. 
That would have been good, but she brought my stepfather along with her. 
He is the cause of my problems. 
I did not want to be around him so I called Jennifer, my stepmother, to come get me.
Then I woke up.

The next dream I had was that my stepfather died in a car accident while leaving their house in Tennessee.
My mother was severely injured and knocked unconscious. 
My brothers and sister were not in the car with them. 
I rushed down to see my mother in the hospital. 
While I was there, she woke up. 
I spoke with her, and she told me a few things.
Then after having reconciled, she started having difficulties breathing and died. 
Then I woke up again. 

Then I had a dream that I had a family of my own with a set of newborn twins.
We lived in a big house, had some money, and were hopelessly devoted to each other and to God.
That was the best dream I had all night. 

I learned that I can always depend on family and God to pull me through the tough times."

I am so confused. I feel like what happened to me was my fault.
I know it was not my fault, but I feel like it was. 
I know that no one ever chooses to be molested. 
Why do they blame themselves for what happened to them?
How does someone help someone like that? 
What do you say to them? How do you treat them?
How are they supposed to act? How are they supposed to feel?
Will they ever get over their fears again?
Will they ever stop blaming themselves?
Why do they always feel so bad? Why do they always blame themselves?
I need help. I have problems. I don't know what to do."

I have grown a lot since the past year or so.
I have grown and still grow more in the Holy Spirit each day."

"event","I have 3 younger sisters that I live with.
They are 8, turned 6 today, and 3 years old.
My sister's birthday party is at 6 tonight. 
I can't wait to see the look on her face when she opens her presents. 
This is the first of their birthday parties I have been to.
I have not been here for quite some time now. 
I never got to see my sisters grow up. 
I missed them even though I only met the two older ones right after the second one was born.
I feel kind of sad that I wasn't here sooner to watch them grow up.
I can't wait until they become teens and drive each other crazy!
At least I will be here for their first boyfriends.
That ought to be fun."

I can't think of anything to compare it to.
Instead of being lost and afraid, I find myself just letting things happen. 
I am finding myself better at dealing with ""sticky"" situations. 
I have only been praying that God helps me deal with my problems.
Without Him I am nothing. With Him I can do anything.
I pray that God continues to help me in my healing.
I also pray He helps deal with life's problems as they are handed to me.
Everything happens for a reason. 
Now I know why some things have happened to me.
I praise God for everything he has done for me in the past couple of months. 
I find myself loving the Lord more and more each day.


I am giving my testimony at the thing with the church this Sunday the 7th.
Just to let anyone who can make it know and for anyone wondering why I have been acting funny."

Three years ago I met a stranger. 
Always wondered what he was like,
Longed to meet him,
Longed to be with him.

Did not know if he was alive,
Always wondered what he was like.
Right now I wish he would get help,
Killing the hate he has in him.

Sometimes it feels like someone stabbed me.
Today it feels like that. 
Right now I love him,
Although he needs help.
Now he won't let anyone help him.
Going crazy all the time,
Evreyone fears him and what he can do.
Right now I fear him too."

The title of it is: The Storm Inside of Me! I would love to know what you think about it. 




Very much has happened to me,
I can not tell a lie.
Rainbows never come my way.
Gray clouds always seeem to stay,
Instead a tornado is heading my way
Never slowing 
Instead it is growing
Always faster while showing.

Always nearer does it come,
Living forever,
Living inside of me.
You never know when it will show.
No one may ever know.
Every day seems to bring a new danger though.

Forever I will live, 
Every day with this storm,
Racing in my soul,
Growing ever faster,
Underneath my skin.
Soon it will come to an end,
On one condition,
Nobody knows."

Are you supposed to cry, get angry, be sad, or get mad? Do you get confused? Do you freak out? Do you stand there and get hurt some more? What are you supposed to do? I like to turn everything over to God because without him I am nothing. Without God, what are you? Are you strong? Are you courageous? Can you face everything alone? I don't think so. I have been hurt by both of my parents, and yet I still turn everything over to God. He has helped me tremendously. He has helped me find a peace of mind. I feel contentment for the first time in a long time. I am stronger because He is with me. I can do anything because God has made me able to do it. I am able to withstand a lot more pain now than I was a week ago because God is with me. You are supposed to turn your every care over to God so that with Him the problem will be resolved. That is what you are supposed to do. You are supposed to stand strong with God by your side, and then you give praise to the Lord for helping you with your problems. That is what you are supposed to do. It may be hard to do at times, but I promise it can be done. I have done it many times this week."

"event","What family problems do you have? Whatever your problems are you will always have some type of family to turn to. If your problems are with your parents, then turn to your grandparents for help. Whether it is just disagreements or being abused by someone in the family, you always have other family members to turn to. If you have problems with your father, then turn to his parents for help. If you have problems with your mother, then turn to her parents for help. If you have problems with both parents and they are divorced and remarried to other people, then turn to their spouses or to the grandparents of the one you want a relationship with. There are many reasons for having problems with family, but you can not turn away all of your family when things go bad with one person. Everyone turns to someone else in the family for help, whether it is for money or for a place to live. You need family. They can help more than you know, and sometimes they will surprise you. Will you turn away all of your family for one person's mistakes? I know I will never do that because my family is a blessing."

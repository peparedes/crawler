"event","i'm still alive.
as the years go on, i get so much more real. there's a small patch on my back where all the fur is rubbed off now - a place that RachelCat rests her cheek against as she sleeps at night.
I love RachelCat, and she loves me.
she's my main woman, I her main man. i'll never betray her, or make her cry, like the others sometimes do..."

"event","i seem to be going on a journey.
I am wrapped round a very hard compressed sleeping bag in a black and yellow rucksack. on top of me seem to be a very short THING in army pattern, some tops, a black dress, and a beeblebear.
i am not too impressed about this seeing as mother had to sit on the bag to get it done up. i blame zaffi for being so fat.... 
THEN she proclaimed that there was another five to six hours to go before i will be unpacked.
she is a harsh mother indeed."

Profile for Grizzly
 
Personality type: Unlovable, uncommunicative, stupid, bossy, egomaniac, jerk.
 
Unlovable
No matter what you do, no one likes you and no one even notices you exist. You very rarely, if ever, have meaningful relationships of any kind with anything other than your own anatomy.
 
Uncommunicative
You find it impossible to express your true feelings or emotions. Your friends (if you have any) think you are a liar, an unfeeling bastard or retarded. Probably all three.
 
Stupid
You are basically thick. If you think back, you will realise this is true. Most people you meet are smarter than you. This is because you are stupid. Ask a friend to explain this to you if some of the words are too long.
 
Bossy
You are constantly telling people what to do. This is because you are basically incompetent and lazy. People make voodoo dolls of you and put them through paper shredders.
 
Egomaniac
You have a bloated self image. Somehow you think you are more than the web surfing loser the rest of the world sees you as. 
 
Your rating as a human being:
21%

The person/character whom you most resemble is:
Garth Brookes (country ""musician"")

I am at school while my MOTHER is at home aving a fun time.
all the other teddies are stuck up, and i am the only REAL one here. 
grrrr.
Also i overheard my mother on the phone to trouble saying that she may not be taking me to ireland.
that upsets me a lot. 
I always used to be her best friend.
now she has a snotty hankie instead of me. i'm feeling left out and lonely, all by myself in the dark......

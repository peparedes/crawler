"event","A complex thing, one could classify it simply as an organ pumping our life. Others could say it is simply something to follow towards happiness. The question is though, what does one do with a heart that refuses love, sympathy, attention or companionship? How does one ""fix"" a heart? Wait diligently for persons willing to aid in this endeavor? Or simply shield this heart behind name brands and bright clothes, playing the part of the social chameleon, blending with the crowds. Belonging to all; Conforming to none.

What I miss more is the crazy nights going to Denny's listening to said music discussing the meaning of life and more.

I think I was using the wrong medium with which to express myself. Art and Culinary didn't do it for me. I feel my passion lies most with Music. I feel there is no deeper outlet then music; One song can trigger a cornucopia of emotions.

"event","I'm not saying that I am feeling that right now. What I can say is that I feel...awkward. Like, I graduated '06. It's '08 already and I'm turning TWENTY come end of August. I feel like I'm stuck in a weird teenager stage considering I finished school at 17. Two years later and it's still difficult. I'm alive by all means and doing well. I wish I was the way I am now back in school, but I doubt McFatter would be able to put up with that much more chaos from my aftermath. 
     Since 2006, I've experienced more in two years, then I've ever thought possible. I've been through my relationships. I've had my likes, my loves and my lusts. I've lost friends, family, and more. I've had many jobs. Seen places. Lived in unsavory neighborhoods or residential areas (Covenant House, taught me people will still find ways to use you). I've seen people come and go. I've Partied. As in ""P-A-R-T-Why? BECAUSE I GOTTA!"". I've become more street smart. I've learned a lot on the subject of how others look at their/others' lives. I've been around the drug scene. Do you know how awkward it is not having seen someone from my high school for two years, then randomly getting a text message asking ""u got ne stuf?"". All and all I think I've seen a lot of negative things around. Why? Mainly because I've asked for it. Because I was so infatuated and curious with how the other side lives, I forgot to learn to separate the difference between my world, and the next. I've had my near-death experiences. On more than one occasion I might add. I don't mean to sound like a braggart, but I've been through hell and back and all before the age of 20. 
     And in all honestly when it comes to the negatives things I've dabbled in and seen I know this one truth:

Better now, than never.

     I would have rather experience every last one of these ""Life Lessons"" now when I'm young and capable of making choices, then older, when it's that much harder to handle these ""Lessons"" because you've grown so accustomed to them.
     And you know what else is interesting. I'm single. Now I can't play the modesty card, or say I'm just ""spitting my game"", but I'll tell you one thing, the day I find someone who can so effortlessly write a deep open conversation like this, is the day I'm kidnapping them and forcing them into marriage.
     Kidding, kidding, but I figured I'd sneak in a cheap laugh or too. Serious business time is....................................................now. 
     I'm going to post a two videos, they connect, two separate parts (yes you have to watch it, visual effects are what make it more impacting), and I would like you to watch them. And truthfully listen to what message is being presented to you. Thoughts or opinions just fire me back a message:

<b>Part 1</b>

<lj-embed id=""1"" />


<b> Part 2</b>

<lj-embed id=""2"" />

The time for change is now. Now is as good a time as ever to turn my life around. The drugs, the bad decisions; Done. It's time to let the good times roll. Besides, a little less stress wouldn't kill me.

Yes, I unfortunately stooped to a new level in myself, meaning, I have done things that I am not proud of, nor am I really proud to admit to my other friends of my deeds. My car accident did indeed shake a couple of things loose, I feel like I lost a portion of my life in that very instance.

Coming damn near death and walking away without a scratch left me with a new kind of... cockiness...

Yeah it's something to brag about, but who likes a braggart?

Let's come clean in a single swing shall we?

<lj-cut>
-Smoked bud everyday for the past..... 2-3 months on a daily basis? That was my breakfast lunch and dinner. I don't eat, I really haven't found the need for it ya know? Baked out of your mind, you only need to eat enough to survive and keep yourself going.

-Drank almost every other night. Hell I haven't been sober a day besides the past two days only from thinking about life and telling myself that I need to get things in order ya know?

-I've rolled. Good Lord if I could roll again (and plan on it) I would do so in a heartbeat. That is the only 1 of these 3 that I know and feel that I didn't do out of seeking escapism. Sweet Jesus all the best things of my life come out all at once when I roll. 

-I've also moved out of my parents house for good.

-And I'm addicted to WoW. You aren't a computer gamer unless you've even heard of this game. Seriously, it's kinda bad, all my friends and family in the house now play it....worse then our Diablo 2 addiction from before lmao.

I'm a Candy Kid now. I'm a Stoner now. I'm a Raver now. I'm a Juggalo now. I'm myself. This is the person that I have decided to be because all of these things I enjoy and found out that I actually have a passion for. Yes I know there will be others that definitely disagree with my choice of a lifestyle, but who cares? Yes it is indeed my life, and yes I am the one in control of it ja? So what prevents me from going completely off of the deep end and sinking into the pit of eternal damnation for good? Her. Sweet jesus, good lord and all that it's holy her. Just the thought of her is enough to make me want to change the past, present and the future all in the name getting her. But her is the catch. How do you obtain perfection? Perfection. A very deep rooted and very meaningful word that I only use when referring to anything having to do with her. Intellectual, BEAUTIFUL in every meaning of the word, smart, has a direction in life, has a very deep social life, has been an amazing friend, makes me unable with to speak to her with just a mere look and the smile that never goes away. It's amazing what one person can do by just being nice to everyone. And once again my typing ADD settles in. *le sigh*

If I could fix something from my past, it'd be to make my middle school dance NEVER end. Ever. I was a good guy, I was nerdy as all crap, but I was where I felt comfortable; good grades in school, always somewhere to go or be, and loads of friends. And don't forget; Her.

Yeah I'm pretty sure by now that I ultimately sound like a stalker (creepy I know, but no I am not like that lol) and could and might as well just seal the damn deal by proclaiming some bizarre undying love. Slight catch; slightly creepy (*rolls eyes* ok very creepy)and very impersonal. 

*shrugs* Guess I'm not that private of a person. *2x shrug* 

Oh, and if you are still reading this, I typed this one-handed like I usually do. I dunno it's more fun and I can focus so much better when I type like this.


*Waves* Well ladies and germs, I'm off. It's time I actually take a stand and try to make a better person of myself instead of expecting someone to swoop in out of nowhere to kick my rear in gear ja?

 So yeah, I got run over...twice. By a cadilllac and a van. Both hit me at about 40-45 mph, then fled the scene. And I will say god damn did I luck out and god damn am I sore. Only 8-9 stitches in my eye, bruised kneecaps, rocked ankle and bruises everywhere.

Man I got lucky.

Well I am fine and yes I am alive. I am currently residing at Covenant House Florida at my own free will, and have moved beyond the very troublesome ""Crisis Center"" side, and am now in the independent living. So basically I'm getting a crash course in how to manage my money, make rent, budget, etc all the essentials, and I get to live on the beach for free~ My phone number has changed, 954-479-9164, please feel free to give me a call because I lost all of my other numbers when my mom gave the other cell to Bernie. I am alive, and after today I should be available to chill til about 9""30 when I have to be back (curfew). Not so bad really.

"event","Well let's do a rundown of the important things in My life.

My life is basically in order.

In just a couple of days I:

Registered for classes at BCC as a full time student.

Got my License.

Got a job at Books-A-Million.

Damn I'm good.

I'm also watchin' what has to be the best thing ever on TV. MLG Pro Circuit Playoffs.

www.MLGPro.com
<lj-cut>
MLG is Major League Gaming. Super Smash Bros. Melee and Halo 2. Played by people who are paid to play. That is goin' to be a goal of mine. Good match, like watchin' football, highlights and everything. You guys wouldn't know, but Team Final Boss, and Team Carbon are the ones to beat. Currenly respectively ranked 1 and 2 in the entire MLG Halo 2 Pro Circuit. The PMS Clan, A.K.A. The Pscychotic Man Slayerz and most recently Pandora's Mighty Soldiers, is the only Pro All Female Clan out there. And from what I've seen and heard, they are by far the nicest. They take any girl, no matter the age, etc, and they train them. There are roughly 4 branches to their Clan: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. This are the wickedest ladies to watch out for, with their Leader in all games they play includin' even Counter Strike, Athena and Athena Twin help the ladies dominate the gamin' field when they're involved in the competition.

I'm sure you're probably tired of hearin' me go on about MLG so that's all for now.

As of January 8th, I'm puttin' all the effort and energy I can muster from this body into school, work and my car. This is for me, not you who think that by applyin' your ""Control"" onto me you will be able to control me. I control me. I am me. You do not make my decisions. I don't glare at you, I give you the look that I give all things in my way. I'm not annoyed, mildly entertained is a better choice of words.

*shrugs* I don't even think that I need a year to be out of this house. I will have moved on to better things.

I hate life.
People need to stay the fuck in their own business.
My stepbrother has become that which I am afraid that I will become.

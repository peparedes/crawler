"event","the past month or 2 has been absolutely crazy but i've finally made a decision: I am in fact moving to virginia.
i've looking at several schools in MD and VA and Piedmont is the one i'm going with. 

pros: graduate in a year, live closer to zak and gwynedd, better quality of education, get out of parents' house, no dealing with community college. (oh dear how i do hate community college) 

cons: no college credit, won't be able to get my massage license in MD because the school isn't accredited (by their choice- the accredited schools i saw were scary bad) 
but i decided it will be worth it to have to work around that stuff, this is what i really want

as of now i don't actually have anywhere to live but tomorrow i'm going to look at a room that sounds really promising...  i really hope it works out because class starts on monday and abingdon to woodbridge is a hell of a commute  
i will also have to find a job down there to cover everything my parents can't but at the moment i am just working one day a week at the ren fair.  my job this year is much nicer than my job last year, if anyone cares to visit i'm working at the wax hands booth, it's not far from the entrance. 

in other news my ol'man has achieved the rank of kinsmen in dagorhir (yay!!) very bad ass.  also i survived my first pennsic and i don't plan on making it my last."

"event","today makes day 2 of unemployment.  got laid off tuesday- it was a temp job so no suprises.
so i've been enjoying some laziness and plotting random stuff- mostly dagorhir related.  getting some weapons made, hopefully kick some ass at althyng, and trying to come up with a weeks worth of garb for pennsic without actually spending money.  ebay is kinda awesome but i can totally see getting addicted and I haven't actually gotten any garb off ebay because i fear it would not fit or just not look good and then i'd be screwed, which is also a concern I have with making my own garb.  i would cry if i spent $60 on fabric, hours sewing and then came out with something that didn't look good on me.

but anyway, what's next? i imagine i'll take the rest of the summer off which will be easy because there are soo many campouts plus pennsic coming up, plus getting registered for school clean out all my old junk, a good bit to keep me busy then in the fall i'll go back to work at the ren fair and i'll go anne arundel cc to finish my massage classes.  ...yet i feel a bit of a pull to move a bit farther south...  i'm afraid if i go to anne arundle i'll end up caught between 2 worlds. i would still be living at my parents' house but that's about an hour north of anne arundle, and then of course the river house and the ren fair are in anne arundel county so i'll be spending a lot of time down there... and of course another hour/hour and a half south of that is where zak and most of gwynedd lives...
i don't know... seems like this fall is going to bring a lot of driving and a lot of distraction... it could be bad... trying to come up with alternatives but it's rather sticky.  i'm still dependant on my parents for a place to live, transportation, health insurance, tuition.... the list goes on
arg... idk"

"event","so i made it to ragnarok! woohooo!

not quite the full experiance though :( drove up friday night w/ Lo'mar and Zwei, I drove the last hour or so so they could get a head start on getting ""all hootied up"" and then as we pulled into the troll (around midnight) i downed a bottle and a half of those schmirnoff thingies. we were planning a grand suprise entrance into camp - loaded and ready to party (Lorrymar=King of Gwynedd, Zwei=Prince, so us showing up was kind of a big deal) but Ludwig had aparently been waiting by troll since about an hour before we got there so that plan kinda failed (aww he's so friggin cute... one of those slow motion movie moments- i walk/run over to him and we are instantly all over each other. it had been a whole week!) so it was a fun night, a bit of dischord but nothing really note worthy, ultimatly I danced untill the sun was up before Ludwig ""persuaded"" (by persuaded i mean carried) me to go to bed.  we slept in and lounged around the tent till around 1. sucked cause it was too hot to sleep and i missed the archery class so i couldn't fight. we wander over to the field and handed out water with Adryanna who had tried to ""make bigger fire"" and burnt her hand (aww poor dear) but neither of us fought.
Saturday night Ludwig and I decided to take a nap before the partying got underway but when I woke up around 11:45 he was dead asleep so he said he'd catch up in a bit and I went ahead without him. unfortunatly gwynedd camp was pretty dead so before long i got bored and got to wanderin'. at least i was smart enough to keep ppl posted on where I was going.  eventually ended up next door in dark angels camp with sarah and sabrina.  they were feeding me falcon's blood, which they warned me would fuck me up, a warning which i did not take seriously enough. eventually i found out the shit was made with everclear- now i knew everclear was strong shit but i didn't know it was a ""stealth liquor"" .... i guess i figured it was a weak mix cause I could barely taste it and at first i could barely feel it. so they kept handing me more and i kept pounding it. i did go back to gwynedd to tell them where i was but the dark andels had drummers so they had me. Ludwig eventually woke up and came over to hang out and watch me dance and keep me out of trouble. it went pretty smoothly it seemed. we went back to gwynedd camp and at this point i'm crawling on the ground around the circle of people by the fire... i felt kinda sick and ludwig started trying to get me to go to bed.  ..ok i'm realizing that i'm not really too sure about the sequence of these events...  but anyway i decided i wanted to go back to DA camp and dance more... i could barely stand but ya know... seemed like i good idea at the time. i suppose i must have gotten a bit beligerent about it cause at some point zak was wrestling me to keep me from going back down... i was putting up a good fight- he said he almost felt proud of himself when he finally won except he realized that i was about half his size and compleatly trashed. eventually came to me bawling about how i was ashamed at myself for losing control again and frustrated that all the gwyneddian guys i had been talking to thought it was fun to just let loose and get as hammered as they pleased - that being reallly fucking hammered-  and never thought any less of eachother for it.  Ok, i've offically experienced this type of drinking and it is once again confirmed to be a bad idea. Now that i'm with Ludwig there's conciderably less potential for me to get in trouble, first of all because I have a stong loyalty to him and even when down to my last little sliver of awareness I know that no other guy had better be kissing me our touching me and if any would try I would loudly express that he needed to back the fuck up. and secondly if anyone got out of line with me Ludwig would fuck them up, especially if he happened to be present at the time and especially if he were also drinking, both of which are ussually the case when i'm drinking.  none the less, i'm not gonna partake in such drinking anymore.  i've had too many people i care about end up worried or mad at me for it to be worth it. maybe it's ok for the gwyneddian guys or the angle heads but it's not for me.  I don't think it's because i'm an alcoholic or i have a drinking problem, but i do have a very low tollerance and i'm very hyperactive so i'm more likely to actually do something, not just pass out, and i'm a girl, i'm friendly/touchy, and I'm a bellydancer and frequently dancing about in skimpy clothing.  everyone is entitled to their own opinion but i don't think any of this makes me a stupid whore, i think i am just a little too trusting and open to be a good candidate for that type of drinking.  ... all this has been very hard for me...    please be patient with me...  
at the end of the night after Zak and I sat down by the lake and talked a bit he caried me back to the tent.  and he was still glad I was there with him. he wasn't mad at me.  when things get bad to have someone like that makes it a lot easier to want to keep on living.  I may not deserve it, but I am sure as hell going to try to make it worth it to him to be so good to me."

"event","so Ludwig (see axefest rant)finally asked for my number :P
yeah, he totally likes me :)
y'see I saw him again at mayhem and it turned out that he had been wishing he had asked for my number ever since I pulled out of the parking lot after axefest.  He was still being kinda shy at the begining of Mayhem but I did catch on that he was into me.  ...  he made me a metal flower *melts* 
so, anyway, his real name is Zak and we have been spending quite a bit of time together lately.   the weekend following mayhem he took me to the sca saphire joust campout. he was the only one there i knew but i still had a great time, most of the weekend was just the 2 of us hanging out.  eventually the question arose, ""... soo, am i like, your girlfriend now?"" and we both agreed that if i wasn't already i aught to be. so that was that. 
this past weekend i was down at his place for the dagorhir battle and it was another awesome weekend.   sunday we spent the whole day just napping on the couch and yknow i could have laid there for a week and still been happy.  such lovely company.
the rest of my time has been spent working at the warehouse so not much else to talk about... he's soooo sweet!"

i also need a hug.... lots of hugs in fact.

i kinda want to run away.  be a flight attendant or something.

this sounds terrible but i feel like my life is more stable when i have a boyfriend and i'm kinda missing that.  it's so good to have someone to share stuff with and i think i need another person to kinda set a direction by.  i know it sounds awful to say i  need a man to be able to know what i want but i think that may be who i am.  not that i don't have my own personality or dreams in life but i need some grounding.  i know i need to learn to make my own choices but there are so many possibilities in life and i can see my self being happy in a lot of them which is kinda convenient in that by being flexible if i find a guy who's nice, and smart, and fun, and respectable and who possesses other such qualities which seem sooo hard to find, then i'll be able to adapt and we can live happily ever after"

"event","This weekend I went to my first Dagorhir campout.  Much fun was had. Much fun indeed.

The Fighting:
borowed a bow from Crystal and used some of Greg's arrows along w/ my slightly improved quiver an old dagger from Greg that I am apparently keeping and my nifty clipy invention.  Had one awesome sneaky backstab and quite a few face shots. unfortunatly  also hit my forearm many times w/ the bow string. It's pretty, all purple and stuff.

The rest: Preston and Margie ..er i mean Jari and Falaria ended up going home that night (Jari got all sickly :( ) so I really had no one to camp with but I was invited to camp w/ Gwynedd and so I did.  Gwynedd likes is generally into plaid things and drinking lots. so needless to say I fit in pretty well.  It seemed that I was ""assigned"" to this guy Ludwig which was cool, he was pretty cool to hang out with and he was very nice to me and took care of me. I say assigned b/c after he let me use his sunscreen I was several times being sent in his direction.  I was told I should set up my tend near him, He was told to help me get set up and walk me around and protect me. It was sugested that I sit on his lap to conserve chairs.  and ultimatly, w/o anyone telling me to I ended up sleeping in his tent w/ him.  That was good though because it was really cold and he was very much a gentleman.  I very much enjoyed his company and respect him for not taking advantage of me in anyway but i'm not sure if he actually liked me.  I kinda thought he did and everyone else seemed to think he did but he never asked for my number or anything.  I don't think he kissed me either.  I think I kissed him several times when I was real drunk but I don't think he ever kissed me.  at first I was worried that it was cause I smelled bad, that morning I realized that I should prolly switch back to men's deodorant for running around and camping out in the summer.  heh.  but now I'm afraid I ruined it by talking about Greg too much.  It was the first time I had seen him since we broke up so it was a little weird but I really wasn't that wrapped up in it .  idk maybe just cause we live about 2 hrs apart.
so yeah other stuff, I drank alot. I belly danced. I climbed a tree.  And I tackeled several large men :) I was just walking around w/ sabrina when we saw Micah and Jebus walking across the field Sabrina said something about tackling them (joking aparently) so sho'nuff *thack* and it just went from there. there were many tackling victims that night but i don't necisarilly remember them all.  I do remember tackling arabus as he was standing by there drinking a beer. he was less than happy. oops. hehe

So yup, those would be the highlights of my weekend."

"event","despite being a bit out of sorts i have had tons of fun the past few weeks.  2 saturdays ago I fought all day at the dagorhir battle which apparently qualifies me as no longer just ""arm candy"" ha. soo much fun running around like a fool shooting at people. and of course lots of quality time hanging out w/ margie and dennis.  then this past thursday after bellydancing class i went along with a few girls from my class (and our teacher) to bull on the beach where I was mistaken for being 21 due to negligence on the part of the guy who checked my licence.  so i went ahead and had a drink with everyone else and then we went out and belly danced on the dance floor for quite some time. i was having a ball :) eventually everyone got all out of breath and went back to the table to smoke but i, with my healthy lungs spent the rest of the time dragging them back out to dance more. great evening lots of dancing and i didn't even get drunk:) yes i do know how to have a good time, drink a bit and not get drunk :)  then friday night i was hanging out w/ crystal and around 10:30 we decided that we wanted to do something exciting so we got all dressed up and went to the goth club. also much fun, much dancing, and a bit more drinking heh. i sorta got caught too, not suprising, i was pretty out of it and not doing such a good job of hiding it but the guy was really cool about it and just told me that i needed to be more careful. but i think crystal had fun too and that was good. wheee i actually like dancing. who knew?"

1. drink less
2. curse less 
3. eat less
4. work more

1- i got out-of-control drunk friday night and saturday night- saturday night my friends actually had to send me to bed because i was being to obnoxious...  i didn't take that well either, i would say being unwanted amoung people you like is one of the most terrible feelings one can experience, not that i think that they're still holding it aginst me but it really bothers me that i came to that.

2- for some reason i've started cursing a lot again. not sure where it came from, just snuck up and i need to cut it out.

3- i've decided i should lose 10 lbs by summer, that's really nothing drastic but i'm just not in the kind of shape i want to be in and i've been eating more than i should so i'm gonna work on that.

4- work harder in school, practice more, exercise more, clean more and all that jazz

so wish me luck and determination, i know i can do better"

i feel like i'm taking more from the world than i am contributing and that sucks. i'm not a kid anymore and yet i'm living at home off my parents' money taking like 15 credits a semester, no job and still i can't seem to keep myself together.  i don't even keep my room neat. so few responsibilities and i still just barely skate by. i hate that i'm so lazy and i hate that i'm sitting here bitching about it instead of doing something about it but i suppose i'll finish anyway. today greg was outside all day in the cold working and i spent most of the day napping. i didn't even ""get around to"" hanging out w/ crystal and jon till like 7:00 or something. part of me wants to get a job so i'll be doing more but i'm afraid if i have more responsibility it will just be more opportunity to screw up. also if i got a job i prolly wouldn't keep volunteering at the hospital. i just need to try harder."

other thing:
i finally started reading 8-bit theatre, which preston and jerrod have told me about for like the past year.  it is friggin hilarious. rofl-lmao."

"event","i just feel like i have a ton of stuff to ramble about right now so here goes.

i always get these feelings that i've done something to make someone think badly of me, often i don't even have a clue what it might have been or even why i would think that someone is unhappy with me.  i think my problem is that at any one time i only have a few little ideas, thoughts, memories, or what have you that keep me attached to reality. beyond that i just percive one moment at a time and the rest is all just feelings and fleeting notions of whatever.  and i guess one of the feeelings is fear that people i care about will leave me, or that i'll drive them away which turns into searching for signs of that happening through my fogged memories, not that i don't remember stuff, but i have trouble remembering it as a big picture. so as i'm searching for any of these little bugs that i'm hoping to fix(subconsiously for the most part) i just get little bits of bad feelings floating through my mind, all detached from any resolutions that they might have had, and then i start searching for the resolutions or justifications or actions i should take to fix stuff. and it's all just really floaty and confusled and i'll just land at this point where my heart's sunk and i feel parylized and lost. generally at this point i either just go to sleep or get distracted by nice music, i like music, i think i helps keep me sane, or some louder/ more concious thought.  i think this type of thing can make me a rather fragile person, but i'm getting better. i think the biggest thing that helps is to just remember that if i did do something wrong and i do end up alone i'll still be ok. i mean, being alone sucks but i know i can deal with it especially when i have my familly, my God, and the kindness of strangers.  yes, the kindness of strangers, i'm pretty shy but i've found that often when i'm lost or otherwise helpless i will find people out of no where who will help me through.  I thank God for them, and i hope i can be that person for other people too.  i trust people a lot, often more than i should, but i think sometimes, for people who aren't hardened, seeing that trust makes people want to live up to it. ... i donno, i might well just be rambling, but maybe this stuff actually does make some sense... i'll re-read it in a few days and try to decide... 
but anyway i want to be a strong person, and i think i'm getting better at just going with stuff, allowing myself to forget things that i just get tangled up in anyways, so i can move through life trying to use each moment as i can and not worry so much over what has been done, because i know i just can't handle it. i suppose that's what Jesus is for too, if i am forgiven by the only power that truly can erase the debt then i can start each day new. and each day i want to be a blessing to the people around me. i want to contribute more to the world than i take from it. it's love that makes the world go round, ya know?
i'm glag that i've found a friend he holds me when i'm fragile and i love him and i love bringing blessings to him it's really nice to have someone to walk beside and someone to laugh with ... it's pretty cool. but i know i can't worry about losing him because it just drains me and probably him too. i just have to have trust, and know that even if i fall i'll get back up
...and now i should get back to work"

so then when i was good and ready to wake up i went out to do some shopping and just spent the rest of the day just walking around belair 
over the course of the day i bought a pair of shoes ($4-and they were exactly what i wanted) 2 tee shirts which i find very amusing and 6 cds at record and tape mostly used and all under $10 and a study bible my mom asked me to pick up for her (and i got a sub and a smoothie yummy!)
tryed to buy warped tour tickets at the ticket master desk at hechts and the guy said they sold out ::panic:: but jimmy got some online so i'm good now (yay we're going to warped tour!!!)
i really like that there are enough stores crammed into a small part of belair that i can just park my car at any of them and walk to the rest and have great fun sliping on wet grass down a small hill and running back and forth across rt24 and rt1"

"event","::Warning: the following is just a lot of me bitching and should not be at all taken seriously, or even read for that matter::

it's friday night and i'm sitting at home alone ... even jimmy is at brians house so they can play WoW together ... but not selina ... it's not that i'm sitting around feeling sorry for myself i just find it rather curious... people just don't seem to realize how pathetic my life really is. 

my parents have been all about trying to find a girl for jimmy lately, they don't seem to realize that i have even less of a social life than he does. they're worried about him because he has more of an antisocial personality than i do but the thing is he has friends. he has known brian since 5th grade. 

my best friend from when i was young was julie and she always got me into trouble and was off in distant lands before i finished 9th grade. she is currently in nyc to the best of my knowledge. the people i have been closest with since then have been boyfriends and they are now ex-boyfriends, making for somewhat dysfunctional friendships.

i didn't meet many people in highschool... i was one of 4 in my graduating class (average was about 20 kids in the whole school most years) i did make a few good friends but i'm not really close with any of them. 

i guess another reason i'm sitting at home is because i'm to lazy to make any effort at doing anything else.

::End bitching::

so anyway... next tuesday in my last day in the warehouse and on wednesday i'm going to WARPED TOUR! woohoo! not that there are all that many bands i want to see but Offspring is playing and if nothing else it's worth it just for that plus dropkick which is sure to be fun and always fun to check out smaller bands that i don't know about and maybe find some new stuff i'll like so i'm sure i'll get my money's worth also both MXPX and Reliant K are playing, not that i'm a huge fan of either but i think it's interesting that there will be 2 significant Christian bands on a secular tour"

""you know what is problem? you water in wine glass"" plus they were gonna make me wear a bow tie ::cringe:: the kitchen guys kept smiling at me rather creepily (they  didn't speak english.) over all lots of anger and confusion and humiliation, plus the day i quit i would have been working through jrca graduation(congratulations jack and heather!) so that made it not worth trying to stick it out one more night

so, new job: ulla popkin! yup, that's right, 8/9 hours a day on my feet in a hot warehouse packing and folding ridiculously large women's clothing. but hey, pays well, plus no public interaction (and no bow tie!) not a bad gig

other news: the next person who says anything along the lines of ""look at you, you've really gained some weight"" will be tackled and then beaten mercilesly with a shoe, probably their own shoe."

so far my summer has been kinda sad. spent a lot of days laying around the house but i have gotten out a little. got to see 2 of my good old jrca friends at colleen's 16th birthday party :) (ha! we surprised you) and i've been out skiing once (i love the water) and the other day i got to go to dc to see some art museums, went w/ this guy i met a long time ago, he drove a really long way to get me... it was weird... but it has been so long since i've been to an art museum that i was happy anyway.
my dad came home the other day and asked me, ""so, where are you working this summer?"" meaning i didn't get the job w/ the people he works w/.  so now i'm just applying to everything i see in the paper 
meh... we'll see what happens"

"event","Death by consumption: my cold has turned into a cough - not just a normal cough- i have this 'sad little orphan' cough  meh... it sucks

Death by finals: so far i'm 2 for 2 on breaking down and crying durring my finals. these were my lab finals, hopefully the others won't bear this curse. first was chem which i didn't know and had spent lots of time stressing over and then frank is just intimidating so that sent me over the edge. the second was EGR in which i had to face -THE SQUIBBER- (fear the squibber!) not a very difficult object to draw but getting it drawn is only half the battle. 

Death by demonic soul seal/sword of kusanagi: ok so i'm gonna die here, that's life, er.. i mean death but if this damn glowy sword kills me before i can pull orochimaru's soul out of his body i'm gonna be pissed... on no wait, that's not me that's hokage-sama. you can do it! hang in there! ... i'll see what happens in a few days when finals are done and i can get ahold of the next few episodes."

"event","pre-finals round of tests is over, which makes life much better for a few days then i can start stressing about finals. there is always work to do but i just want to relax a bit. i did manage to finish my EGR essay on time this morning and i am in the process of doing some laundry so i'm not just compleatly wasting all my time. the rest of today and tomorrow i'm just going to relax a bit and work on some of the simple things i need to get done before the end of the semester. then i'm off to ruggers fest! i'm sort of questioning my own sanity for deciding to go away the weekend before finals to play rugby but oh well i just can't pass it up. life is short and rugby is awesome. (although it may make life shorter lol)
i'm excided about going home, i'm a little bit worried that i'm not going to want to come back in the fall. unfortunatly i won't be able to live in mckee next year, the last room was taken by the 2 girls directly infront of me and mal when we went to sign up :( so of all places i will be back in young east, young east is apts. that they were going to make freshman housing but they ran out of space so they had to open up a floor for upperclassmen.  yeah, geneva is kinda retarded. oh well, at least i'll be w/ mal."

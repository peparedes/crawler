"event","Yeah for the past week I have not been able to sleep very much. Had a lot on my mind. Trying to drop math but my dad wont let me. We got into a huge fight. Its kinda funny. He compairs me to andrew when I am worse then him. Then says that he wont compair us when I am better. I guess I am just going to fail to him. I guess he is scared I wont have something to excel in Like Andrew. I guess I will fail again."

"event","Today I was sitting back and thinking about my life and everything that has happend. I have treid to think about who I think are my ""true"" friends, but I cant seem to thinkof any of them. I have grown to realise I have no honest to god true freinds. No one I can be myself 100% to them, no one I can be 100% honest too, no one I can honestly say I love. I have been really close to that. But Never fully there. My bday is coming up soon. Im fear it will be a little like last year. from  my dad last year all he said was ""Happy Bday, I am going to my girlfreinds bye"" My mom called and had Liam talk to me and my nana called But that about it. A lot of my friends forgot. So this year I am tryiing to blow it off 100%. I just dont want it to happen. I dont want to end up sad and deppressed. I will be home alone since my dad works. Thats how I want it. So I can sit in a corner in my room and cry. Thats how I would like it. To save myself from worring about everyone who forgot. So please if you know its my bday ignore it. dont bring it up to me. So that way not only does it not look bad for the peope who forgot but Im not pissed for being reminded. I am only a year older. Not like that matters. And I want to thank a friend of mine. Who sat and talked to me today as a was crying because I had a lot going on. Even though he only reminded me of what I already knew. guys are lame!!!!!! There was also more today that set me off. Things reminded me of past issues I had. Also I found out someone I really cared about was not 100% honest with me about what and who he was. I also found out that A guy I dated a while back is still an ass hole. He has taken me for the ride of a life time. I have decided That I am going to get back on anit deppresants because I am falling back into my old ways I just want to run away and never be found. Today I was also talking tomy ex boyfriends girlfreind. I dont know if I was Jealus cause I miss him or because they have a great relationship and I wish I had one myself. I just dont know anymore what I want or what is best for me."

"event","So last night I went to a party. It was with a girl whom used to hate me. Go figure. She was key word. dating an Ex of mine. Andy... WOOO HOO! So he made her hate me but now that they are not together we are friends. Like so Awesome. So she invited me to a party last night. Wow. this girl was like ""yeah there will be beer and stuff there I'm going to buy it"" hahahah Yeah right. She ended up giving out like 8 beers and raiding her parents drinks. I was like what a dumb ass. This was also a VERY nice house... I wonder what it looks like now. all the people there looked like stupid drunks. Like they took a pool stick and hit the pics on the wall.. Please pics of this if anyone took it! So me and Val got a beer but her friend (our ride) looked pissed and wanted to leave so I had to give my beer away and Val let grover drink hers. Mine was almost gone but I cant chug it.. So we ended up going to the bowling ally to see some people I guess and then played some games... Well we all wanted to go watch a move somewhere Vals sis had the TV at her house. Grover just didn't want us there ;( So they ended up dropping me and Val off so they could have some ""alone"" time. So we watched this REALLY fucked up movie where people were on drugs and saw fire and satin on the walls. It  was funny as all hell. Yeah but Imp going now... The oddness of last night isn't absorbing in yet."

And so this girl I met on IRC she Says she is Bi. But from what if know she would NOT be excepted in the Bi/gay couture here. Cause if you say ""gay in the wrong term... It will be about 5 sec before someone will slap the shit out of you. If you are gay or bi and you don't stop someone from saying it then you get slapped as well. There are about 8 Gay people at my school and like 20 bi.... All the bis are not girls either... And those are honestly bis. not just trying to turn on a guy by saying ""I would make out with her for you"" I hate girls like that. its stupid as all hell. I love being who I am. I would never change anything about who I am as a person. Yeah I can be a bitch sometimes. But I get over shit so fast.

"event","Have you ever felt so in love with someone. Like you would do ANYTHING to be with them. There is this someone... I am so Crazy about him and have been for a while. I would give ANYTHING to be with him and be in his arms 24/7 To wake up and be able to whisper I love you to him. Just to wake up not alone and in his arms. I really hope when this time comes it will be so shocking and enjoyable for both of us that he will never leave again. He will be here with me until I am free from my living hell. Have you ever been so in love that you just knew... You would die if you lost that one person!"

"event","Yeah so I am trying to find something to do. I know I have to go to the mall before school starts to get some more stuff. But no one is online that can go with me. Andy is being a fucking shit head... Rene is still Idle. I think she is pissed at me fore something. I think it has to do with either PJ or something else I don't know. And and I want someone to go with me. I am trying to get my friend from West Linn here but he is being a dumb ass...!!!111oneoneone So I might go alone. I'm fine with that don't get me wrong. I actually get it all done and fast. But its a LONG trip! It takes like an hour there and back... and with no one to talk to in-between. I wish me and Sam still talked. But who cares she would end up blowing me off again and I don't want to deal with that today. School starts in 2 days.. Ohhh noes! back to hell with people I HATE! I cant wait to grad this year. So I don't have to deal with people or at least that many people all day long. Its fucking stupid for I think its 25 min a day we have to sit and read a book. I'm like what the crap is that! I meet this girl today she is awesome... She chats on IRC with me.. Yeah I don't know what else to type about. I am fucking hot right now.. MY room never cools down. Yeah well KTHXBI!! come back another day!"

"event","I hate my boss.  Yeah I'm gonna start my entry off like that today.  He is really pissing me off.  Last week I finally finished with that online training for Quality Inn.  I had to come in early the other saturday cause we had a trainer also come in and go over everything with us.  Well my boss missed like the whole class.  When I came down to the lobby for a quick break he told me that I had better learn, and know everything the teacher; is teaching me.  Oh and that there is no excuses for me to forget anything, incase he or Arun needs MY help learning the computer.  Are you serious?? Your the manager, get off your lazy ass and utilize the damn training for yourself also.

We also had to go through the material and take the tests before the trainer had arrived.  Well my manager didn't go through any of the material, and he made me stay in his office and basically give him all the answers.  Yeah thats my boss for you.  I'm just fed up with it.  Not only that I've been coming to work sick but not deathly sick, and he wanted me to come out in the pouring rain to grab some of the breakfast stuff.  I hate this place.  I'm only sticking it out cause I'm not going to be here much longer.

Thursday night I'm jetsetting off to Virginia to visit Alex!  I was soposse to originally go this past weekend but he had to go underway for 2 weeks.  I miss him, and can't wait to see him!

Hopefully, I will feel better.  Right now I have a Sinus infection/cold.  I have been taking Night Quil/Day Quil and Vitiam C Immune booster.  But still not much improvement.  I don't miss work unless I'm physically uncapable of going to work, cause I'm just that sick, I have a temperature, or If I can't keep anything down.  I did call out sick once out of the whole time I have been here when I really wasn't,  then like 2 days later I really was sick..

But anyway, I sound like hell.  Tomorrow it will be a week since I've been ""sick"".  

I went drinking Saturday night.  I went out to Dave and Busters.  I got completely wasted.  Because I have a sinus infection..I couldn't taste a damn thing.  I had like 6 or drinks of something.  All I know is it had Hypnotic, Vodka, and Oj and maybe soemthing else.  I knew it was strong cause I could tell the way it went down.  There was this guy sitting next to me by himself.  He had a watch on.  (Incase you don't know I love it when a guy where's watches.  I have no idea why..but whatever)  So I was like ""Hey I like your watch.""  He was like ""Thanks""  Then I stupidly was like ""Yeah I like it when guys wear watches.""  He turns to me, and he didn't say anything.  I was like ""Yeah, Awkward sorry..""  Then he was like ""No, hey everyone has there thing.""  I was embarrised for like a spilt 2 seconds..then I decided to goto the bathroom.  There I am in the bathroom, and I am trying to call my boyfriend Alex.  Somehow I dropped my phone and it went sliding across the floor.  I was like ""OH shit!""  Thats how my phone got busted...

On the home was not a pleasent seen...I got motion sickness in the car and we had to pull over.  I was ranting and raving about how stupid drunk drivers are.  I was like ""I'm in the passanger seat and I can't even look at the road..why the hell do drunk people think they can drive?  Are they stupid??!!  I'm smashed, and I know I'm not capable of driving!""  It was kinda funny.  Then when I got home.  Because my I threw my purse and water bottle on top counter..my water bottle fell and down, and there was water all over the floor.  I just left the water on the floor and picked up my bottle.  Then I guess I found my mom's phone, and I went on facebook to get Alex's number.  I soppose it was my mission to leave him a voice mail.  Then I guess I left one.  Then I decided to take a shower.  I'm like barely consionce, and I'm taking care of myself.  So I get in the shower.  I shampoo, and condition my hair.  I attempt to wash my body with out falling down a couple times.  It was pethic.  Then I ended up passing out in the shower.  I honestly don't know how long I was in there for.  Then I finally got out.  Managed to put my clothes on the correct way.  Tried brushing my hair twice but I gave up cause my hair was tangled, and I couldn't function drunk.  Then past out on my bed.

I woke up about 8:30a.m.  I was still buzzed, and hungover...I was thristy.  I almost thought I left my diamond ring at Dave and Busters, cause when I woke up it wasn't on my finger.  Cause I always take it off when I wash my hands.  But apparently I remembered to put back on my ring.  I just took it off when I hoped in the shower.  So not only I was sick but I was hungover.  I wasn't planning on getting that drunk..but oh well.  It makes for an interesting story.  Only I would do something stupid like that.

Yesterday, I took another shower, and then I went out to coldstone creamery last night.  It was good.  I also called t-mobile, and I'm having them replace my phone.  They were like ""did you drop it?""  I'm like ""Not to my knowledge..""  The buttons on the phone wasn't working.  Right now I'm using my old phone..till the new one gets here.

Tomorrow is SHANNON LEIGH MCNAIR'S BIRTHDAY!!! I LOVE HER!!  I'm going to be seeing her soon in Florida this month.  I can't wait!  I haven't seen my bestfriend in almost a year! :("

"event","Ok, so it may be possible that some of you are wondering what the hell my AIM away message is about (the pissed off ones), and maybe saw some of what I'm going to talk about in my facebook.  

Let me start it off straight from the beginning.  On Feb 14th my EX friend Apryl picked me up at my work.  We went down to Longhorns to pick up some dinner.  I had accidently left my Capital One credit card in her car.  I didn't relize that I had left it in her car until the next day.  So you know I called her and was like ""I left my card in your car, as soon as you find it can you please call me.  If you don't find it tonight I will call tomorrow and report it lost.""  basically she said it wasn't a problem.  Later she calls me and asked me if I would come over to her house to put on her sheets on her bed.  I said ""Sure no Problem""  she told me that her mom had bought them for her.  I was like thats cool.  She told me that she didn't find the card yet but it had to be in her car. I was like ""yeah I know your right.""  

Then she called me the next morning and told me her mom had just bought some new clothes.  I thought it was odd that all these new stuff she got in such a short amount of time.  I saw her around 12 the next day and she gave me back my Capital One card.  

Now I didn't call the c/c company because I was 100% sure I left it in her car, not only that I only had a $500.00 credit limit (which only 30.00 was left)...which went up to $750.00 on Feb 4th..and I didn't know that.

That is until I decided on Feb 19th to view my bills online to see what needed to be paid.  All of a sudden I see charges for:

$174.00 at walmart
$104.00 at another walmart
$42.00 at a Race Trac gas station.

I was sooo pissed off.  I couldn't believe a ""friend"" just did that to me.  But lets not stop there.  That night I was already planning on seeing her, and I had to get my stuff at her house.  I was like ""Lets see these clothes that your mom bought you.""  I was hoping she would be honest with me.  Now I talked to Kyra, and we agreeded that I should leave all my credit/debit cards here at work where no one would find them.  So I don't have to worry about her stealing them.

I had slept over her house one last time 3 weeks ago.  See I was trying to get my dooney and bouke purse back which is like worth $200.00.  As soon as I woke up I immeditely checked my wallet and my Discover card was missing.  I called them right in front of her and reported it lost/stolen.  Later I checked Apryl's wallet and what do you know my Discover card is in her wallet.  

After she had dropped me off from work.  I later confronted her online.  And she tried lieing some more.  I asked her if she had stolen any of my other c/c.  she was like ""No I haven't.""  I'm like ""your lieing to me again.  You used my Capital One card.  I gave you 3 weeks to come clean with me.  Did you steal any other money from me.""  She says no.  So I say ok.

Well about 2 weeks ago I opened my WAMU statement.  It's a debit card which has had $1.00 on for like a year.  So I never checked my statements.  The only reason why I did was because I had gotten a letter from Discover saying to get a new card (which I already did at the time with all my cards).  So I checked my wamu figuring they were gonna issue me a new card.  But no I see MORE charges that were all pretty much made on the 20th of Feb.  22.00 to the movies 67.00 at Krogers (grocery store), and 16.00 at sonic. On top of that an overdraft fee because the stupid bitch put me in the Negatives.  Basically she went into my purse the when I slept over, spent a bunch of money and put it back in my wallet.  You know whats funny she bought me sonic..using my own card!

I had relized the only card I didn't leave at work was my wamu.  I didn't think anything of it cause it was behind in my wallet..and you would think you would get declined with $1.00 on it.

I don't talk to her anymore.  She doesn't have anymore friends anymore.  I'm pissed cause most likely she will only get probabtion for a federal offense.  She told the police that she used it because she was in a ""bit of trouble"".  Yeah ok.

Up until this year I have never had a friend like that. Shady, dishonest, thief, manipulative, physcotic bitch.

If anyone of my friends needed money from me.. you can fuckin ask me with out having to steal from me.  If I have it I will lend it to you.

Because of her.  Aside from my close and tight friends.  I don't trust anyone that much.  Because of her she set my trust back for everyone else.  

I could always trust people right off the bat, because I like to believe that people are good.

So right now, I'm currently reviewing my friends.

If I am going to have a constant friend in my life that I see pretty frequently..I want to be able to trust them, and be dependable.  Cause thats just the kind of person I am.  

It just really bothers me that a soppesedly a good friend did that to me.  I don't understand what I did to deserve that.  But I'm glad I found out the kind of person she really is.  And I was madder than hell, and I'm still not thrilled but I'm moving on from the situation.  

Aside from having a realy shitty friend..I still like to think that overall my life is still pretty faboulous. 

Now NEW TOPIC.  Easter is coming up.  I hate that Holiday.  Incase you didn't know, my dad passed away on Easter Sunday back in ""94"".  So since that I find it always the hardest holiday for me.  That day back in ""94"" is inbedded in my brain.  Steph (my sister) tells me I should try to enjoy it.  She was 3yrs old when our dad passed away.  So really the Holiday doesn't effect her half as much as it does me.  Mom is the only one that understands.  I find that my birthday is a little hard too cause thats when he was sick.  I remember he couldn't even walk to bring his mug into the kitchen.  I was had turned 9 that day.  But Easter is worse.  It's like the end of march/beginning of April is my roughest time of they year. 

It's wierd sometimes when I talk about him, i get chocked up about it.  Then other times I'm ok about it.  Some years it feels easier, other times difficult.  Stephanie doesn't like to talk about him much because she didn't know him.  The death of my father hasn't effected my sister.  I think just when she was younger for like a few months.  I think it was even more difficult for my mom seeing how she got left to raise us by herself.

If I had the option though of getting my dad back alive today, I wouldn't chose it.  Only because even though I went through some difficult times loosing my dad, and sometimes miss him.  I am happy with where I am at my life.  I guess because my childhood growing up with my dad was not good, nor normal.  I didn't have a childhood.

I also strongly believe that everything happens for a reason...and if God didn't think I was strong enough to handle what I have been through, he wouldn't bring that upon me.  I try so hard to take the negative stuff that happens to me, and make it into a positive outcome.

I'm 23 years old.  I'm still young (yeah i know i said young).  But life can end at any time, and time flys.  I like to learn from my parents, friends, and the people that were or are in my life.  Weather it was from something negative or positive.

So even though my own father sucked at being a parent for atleast 6yrs of my life, and decent for 3, I've learned at an early age the things not to do, and how not to be like him, and what would happen to me if I followed his path.

I'm really thankful that I have a WONDERFUL mother (even if she is overproctective).  She is such a strong independent woman, she always put my sister, and I first before her. She made sacrifies so steph and I could have it good. She taught me to always keep going, and to never give up on life even when there are times you want to.  She taught me to work through my problems.  She also taught me to never depend on anyone but yourself...because at the end of the day you only have yourself.  I think thats why my sister and I are so independent, and her, and I don't like asking for help.  No matter how small or big. 

Because I grew up poor (for a while). I learned on my own to apprectiate the things in life, and not to take anyone or anything for grantide because it can all go away in a snap of finger.  

Well I wrote another long entry.  I just figured I would once again share my feelings, and whats going on in my world."

"event","""I've decided not to date any guys. Not until I move anyway. Just because I have to much going on down here with work, and trying to spend time with my family and a couple of friends. Not to mention I don't need anything chaotic in my life. There really wouldn't be much of a point I sopposse if I'm moving. After the year I had, I could use a break. I think sometimes when youv'e been in a relationship too long (especially if it wasn't the best) you can kind of intend to loose some of who you are as a person. Maybe that sounds too cliche or corny. But I have been through so many changes since I've moved down here. I think I would like to find some of myself again. I'm not perfect, and I know I'll never be. However, I think there's some things that I can improve on. Right, now I just want to put myself first.""

Ok so of course I never followed through with that.  Usually when I say I wanna do one thing I completely do the opposite.  It's never on purpose eithier.  Seems like when your not looking or not expecting someone or something, they find you.

So I'm now with this guy named Alex.  Like I said in my last entry.  I met him in December of ""06"" at my work.  I was actually visting Apryl that night.  She was on shift.  It was like 3a.m. in the morning.  He had came into just use the bathroom.  Of course the door was locked because technically after 10 were not soposse to let anyone in the lobby.  Even though it wasn't my shift I had let him in.  Then we ended up talking for a like 3 hrs or so that night.  And pretty much ever since then we stayed in touch.  The only time we really didn't keep in touch was until Andy had moved back to mass.  

Alex is orignally from Texas.  However, because he is in the Navy currently he is stationed in Norfolk, Va.  He has a Year, and a half left in the Navy.  So I'm not sure whats going to happen after that.  I can, well I should say we can only take it one day at time.  I know alot can happen in that amount of time.

So as you know, or maybe most of you know.  I went to Virginia, this past weekend.  I arrived in Virginia at 8p.m.  I couldn't believe I was actually there when I saw Alex.  He looked REAL good.  We went to his place on the base.  He cooked me Hawaian Chicken,  I helped him, and made the mashed potatoes, and we had mixed veggies on the side.  

The next morning he had let me sleep in.  He cooked me breakfast in bed that morning.  It was so sweet.  No guy ever has made me breakfast in bed.  So because he made me breakfast, I cleaned up the mess.  He really didn't want me to do it.  But I didn't leave him a choice.  I'm a believer in 50/50.   However, I'm the kind of girl that likes to cook with the other person, and clean up with the other person.  I hate doing that shit if no one is there to atleast keep me company.  I hate cleaning cookware, and cooking by myself.  But if someone is there to eithier help me, or talk to me while I'm doing that.  Then I'm good.  Maybe its weird I don't know.

After a few hours we finally got out of his place, and went out to eat for lunch, then made a stop at the mall.  Went back to his place, then went out for dinner.  After we went out for dinner, we came back and melted the chocolate and dipped the strawberries in the chocolate.  Then we put the dish in the fridge to cool off.  Then we attempted to watch this movie called ""Shoot Em up""  which was a wierd movie, but we fell asleep.  I was exhausted.

Then the next day we pretty much just hung out, and ate those strawberries, and chocolate.  Yummy.  My flight was departing that night around 7.  It was hard saying goodbye.  I maybe visting him again soon.  

Right now he is on a ship for the week.  I have only talked to him on the phone 2 days this week.  We have been mostly staying in contact through e-mail.

Alex is pretty everything you could ask for in a guy and more.  He knows what he wants to do with his life.  He has goals in life.  He's a great guy.  I'm his #1 priortity.  Which is a nice change.  He makes me happy, and thats all I can ask for.

If someone told me a few weeks ago I would be in a relationship.  I wouldn't have believed them.  I just didn't think I would be with someone so wonderful, and so unexpectedly.  I love my random life.  I thought this year was going great..but it just keeps being random, and more amazing each day.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  I love my random life."

"event","Ok, so as I said before 2007 sucked big time.  From beginning to end.

2008 yeah I'm loving it :)  Umm its pretty amazing.  Like from literally Day 1.  

Simple things, or people out of nowhere make my life pretty interesting.  Wheather there physically here or not.  Like technically everything that is pretty much going on in my life is long distance.  Like friends from home, and a certain person that I like, who lives out of state.

I just don't really know how to start this entry.

After 2007 was over.  My New Years reselutions was just to ""go with the flow"".  Pretty much my motto this year.  Not to mention stop putting everything I have into one person especially too soon.  Cause for some reason when I do that, I'm the one that gets screwed over.  

Yeah, so basically from Jan 1st around that time..I made a complete 180 change.  

Just so you know guys.  I'm not gonna chase you.  I'm just gonna replace you.  I'm just not in the mood to deal with guys that don't know what they want, have their ex-girlfriends as friends, play games, and act like a child.  I'm not a mind reader eithier.

Like I just don't give a flying fuck.  It's an awesome feeling.  I feel like I have everything in my court.  The ball is in my hands, and no one is gonna take that ball away from me.

I know who I am, and I know what I want.  I can offer the you the best of me.  I'll do anything and everything for that person.  Maybe thats one of my faults.  I'm just too nice.  Some days I may be at my worst.  But if you can't handle my worst...then you clearly don't deserve my best.  

Take advantage of me..and I wont forget it.  Screw me over, and I wont forget about that eithier.  

Eithier way...no matter what a guy thinks, says, or does to me thats negative.  I'll turn that shit around and make it into a positive thing.  And then when I look for the next guy I'll make sure he's everything your not.  Not to mention twice as better.

Also not to mention. What is it with guys wanting what they can't have?  It seem's like sometimes it takes someone else to step into the picture before they relize what they had in front of them.  Which is sad and pethetic.

I just figured I would lay it all out there.  This entry isn't to any certain guy.  

As of right now though, I met this guy Alex in December of 2006 in Georgia.  He's been interested in me for quite a while.  However, during the time I was engaged..he respectfully gave me my space.  We talked here and there.  Well anyway lately we have been talking alot.  Which now leads me going to Virginia.  I go in 3 weeks I can't wait!!  He seriously is a sweet guy.  We talk on the phone for hours like everyday.  He's just real, down to earth, honest, caring, makes me laugh, doesn't play games, most importantly very respectful, and I could go on and on.  He basically makes me a PRIORITY, and not an OPTION.  Cause I'm NO ONE'S OPTION!  He apprecitates me, and does't take me for grantide.  Like I said before though.  I'm just going with the flow.  I'm loving my life, and enjoying the ride.

Oh btw, why is it that the people that like me live out of state?  Figures, I can get them out of state, insept for the one I live in.  Not sure how that works. Maybe its the fact that they may be redneck, ""white trash"", or there missing their teeth, or they smoke! Eww."

"event","So did I mention how happy I am 2007 is done?  What a crazy year that was..

Since the 1st I can honestly say things have been smooth sailing.  Like aside from working EVERYDAY, and being deprived a little bit socially.  Things are going really well all around.   Well the financial stuff is something I'm in the process of working on.  But like I said smooth sailing haha.

Its amazing.  I have no drama going on (usually that would have something to do with a guy of course).  This has probably been the calmist in my life in a while.  Cause if you know me, you know my life for the most part is kinda crazy (wheather its good or bad) there is usually something always going on.  So this is a nice change for a little while.  I'm gonna enjoy it, while it lasts.  I still can't believe I'm happy.  I haven't truly happy in god knows how long.  Like who is happy when they have to work everyday? lol.  Then again it could be because my plans (for moving) are finally being put in motion,  Which is exciting.  If it was possible for me to work more than 64hrs I would.  So I could leave sooner.

I've decided not to date any guys.  Not until I move anyway.  Just because I have to much going on down here with work, and trying to spend time with my family and a couple of friends.

I still can't believe I'm gonna be moving this year.  That's gonna be my most major change this year.  Thats about the only big plans I have this year.  Everything else falls second.  I have no idea whats gonna happen this year.  But I'm excited.  I have a feeling its just gonna be a great year, and alot of unexpected things are gonna happen.  

My life is like a rollarcoaster, its just one hell of a ride.  But I wouldn't have it any other way.  Like I said though right now everything is calm and good.  But you know what they say there's always a storm after the calm...

Oh Today is my sister's 17th birthday!  Crazy I know!  Her and I are gonna spend some time together friday night.  Were gonna goto the movies.  I miss her."

2. Always, put myself first before others.

3. The Knowledge to know I deserve better.

4. To not give so much of myself so soon.

5. To take a break from relationships for a while, and learn to accept being by myself again.

6. To go with the flow.

7. Do not over-react when emotionally upset.

"event","So this past Sunday I woke up at like 2.  I went out to eat with my mom.  Then we decided to goto the mall.  Just to pick up my moms shoes.  Which turned out that I ended up going on a shopping spree lol.  I told my mom that I wanted that Star Necklace, Sweaters, long sleeved shirts, and some socks.  Honestly, I could have sworn I had more long sleeve shirts but I have no idea where they went off too.  I cleaned out my draws this summer and went through all the clotehs I did, and didn't wear to make room for new clothes.  So I needed some sweaters cause I needed to update the wardrobe.  I have more hoodies than sweaters.  So I pretty much got what I asked for.  I also wanted another Dooney and Bourke but I figured that can wait for my birthday.  So I know all my gifts but its fine.  Atleast I got to pick em out.

I already finished my Christmas shopping weeks ago.  Thank god.  Cause the mall is packed.

For the rest of the week.  I cleaned here and there.  Thursday though I pretty much did the full fledge cleaning.  Dusting, Vacuming, Laundry, pretty much the whole 9 yards.

Yesterday, I just chilled all day.  I wrapped up the gifts I purchased.  Then later went out by myself and saw a movie.  After I went to the movies. I stopped at the liquar store.  I bought a huge bottle of blueberry or fruit punch PUCKERS, and Absolute Citron so I can make me some blue martinis.  I plan on drinking that tomorrow night with Traci.  Traci is working tomorrow night 10p.m. - 6 a.m.  So I'm gonna go to the Holiday Inn Express with booze at hand and drink it with Traci.  Not only because its a Sunday but also because its the Holidays its gonna be MEGA slow tomorrow night.  So why the heck not drink at the Holiday?

So I hope everyone has a Happy Holiday!!"

"event","So Steph, nick and I did end up going to Starbucks.  Nick got pissed cause some lady was being a bitch to him.  He wanted a certain drink and apparetnly she didn't know how to make it.  I love Starbucks.  My favorite drink is an Iced Mocha Latte.

Nick decides that he wants to play phase ten.  They wanted me to play. I wasn't really in the mood.  I told them that if we were gonna play.  I wanna play at Borders cause I didn't feel like being at my house.  So we get there.  The guy that was working behind the counter apparetnly remembered my name, and the drink, I drink.  I was like ""Wow, your remember.""  After an hour I decided to order a French Vanilla Coffee.  I paid for a small but he gave me a medium.  I was like ""Wow thanks.""

I lost at phase 10.  I was stuck on 3 the whole time.  Jerks.

So it's Thursday now. I get up at about 7:20a.m.  I was so tired, I didn't wanna get out of bed.  I basically through on some jeans, and a sweatshirt.  Then washed up of course.  My mom wanted me to attend this ""brunch"" thing at this store called Belk.  Stupid me agreeded cause I haven't seen my mom for like 2 days.  So as we head in, outside it says ""Coffee and Card Exchange""  See my mom joined this thing ""Douglas Chamber of Congress""  (something like that).  It's like a click for businesses.  Douglasville people are snobby and prefer to buy or shop if your a member of this thing.  So a whole bunch of them get togther at this thing and talk business.  I'm like ""Mom please don't invite me to anymore of these things.  I'm the only young person and this is boring.""

Then we had to drive to this bakery cause my mom had to bring some flowers to her.  The nice lady offered us free samples.  Cake was delicious.  I want her cake for my birthday.  I was soo thirsty though after eating that so I had to go next door and buy a water.  The guy was like ""Have you ever eatin here before?"" Ii was like ""uhh no but I just had tihs cake and I was thirsty.""  He was like ""well if would you like a sample of our hotwings?  That when you come back you'll come here for lunch.""  I said ""Sure.  Why not.""

Later though I got sick. Uhh I hate feeling sick.

The Next day on Friday I felt way better.  I pretty much did some laundry and stuff.  I took a shower.  

At 4p.m. I decided to take a couple hr nap.

My cousin Keith calls me at 5:40.  I answer the phone.  ""I go oh hey i gotta tell you how to get here."" I'm like a little disoriented due to the fact I just woke up.  He goes ""Whats your adress""  I told him.  He started laughing at me saying ""I'm right outside your house.""  I was like ""Oh shit.  I'll be down in 2 seconds?""  

We had to stop at my mom's work because she had bought the tickets for me.  So we didn't have to wait in line.  On the way there he was being my cousin and giving me shit. lol.  After we got the tickets we left my mom's work.  He was pulling out on to the street.  Now this street has like 2 lanes one way and 3 on the other side.  there is like a Medium in the middle.  Technically he was soposse to make a left leaving.  Dumbass decides to make a right so you know we go over the medium.  I was laughing so hard at him.  He was like ""YOu were distracting me.  Telling me you wanna goto strip clubs.""  I'm like ""you were the one telling me about how you sopossedly met a chic called Candy apples from a stip club.  Don't blame me for getting old.""  It was funny just giving each other a hard time.

We decided to go to Wild Buffolo Bills or something like that.  My cousin wanted to order me a shot but they didn't have what he asked for.  We were talking about my 21st birthday how he sopossedly had to take care of me lol.  I'm like ""I remember Matt doing it more so.""

Then we headed to the mall where the theathers are at.  We had some time to kill before we headed in to the movies. I helped him by a Christmas present for my cousin Jason and his wife Michelle.  Keith was like ""You should help me with the rest."" lol.  We didn't have time though.

After that we went to see ""I Am Legend""  My cousin went to the bathroom while I went to go grab some seats.  He was like ""Oh you want anything.""  I was like ""Uhh a coke or diet coke is fine.  I don't care what you get.""  My fuckin cousin comes back with 2 small drinks, small popcorn, and the 2 shopping bags.  I went to help him out right away.  I was like ""Keith I would have taking your shopping bags if I had known you were gonna get this much.""

As far as the movie is concerned it was a pretty good.  I wouldn't say it is Oscar worthy. 

So later Damian comes to pick me up.  We go to IHOP.  We met up with my sister and Nick of course. I actually ate alot.  I had 2 scrambled eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 1 pancake, and one toast.  Not to mention I ate dinner earlier so that was good.

So thats was my 3 days of acutally stuff.  Oh yeah I picked up my star diamond ring.  It's pretty amazing.  I really wish I had a star diamond necklace to match it.  I have been wearing my heart necklace since september of 05.  People from home are like you always wear that same necklace.  Thats because that wasn't cheap.  If I am gonna buy something expensive I better be getting my moneys worth."

"event","So I finally fell asleep last night at like 5a.m.  Lately I haven't been sleeping well.  I think I have mentioned that earlier.  

Today I woke up about 10:45a.m. I was so tired I didn't want to get out of bed.  I had to take a shower though and straighten my hair.  I hate my curly hair.  

I left my house around 12:30.  I went out to eat for lunch with Traci from work.  We went to some Itlain place in D'ville.  I got chicken parm.  I ate a little bit.  Traci noticed I lost wieght.  I haven't seen her since thanksgiving week.  She was like ""Aren't you soposse to gain weight around the Holidays..?""  She's says ""any skinner your gonna look like Marykate and Ashley Olsen.""  I already have my sister on my ass about my eating.  She calls me anerexic.  Nice huh?  Steph's like ""What happen to that shelly appetite?""  I have been trying to eat more. I know its my responsibilty to take care of myself.  It's just I don't feel like cooking and I don't have much of an appetite.  But thats a lousy excuse I know.  I'm working on it so no worries.

Well all in all my lunch with Traci was pretty good.  I got to catch her up on everything there is to be cought up on.  Then we went to the mall.  I wanted to see if I had recieved my diamond ring yet.  It should be in tomorrow.

I came home at about 3. I talked to Shannon for about 3hrs outside.  It was a beautiful day.  It was nice and warm out.  I was wearing a t-shirt outside.

In about 10 min or so my mom should be coming to pick me up.  Were going out to eat at Texas Road House.  I have no idea what I'm gonna order but I'll be eating.  I'm gonna see if Steph wants to go to Starbucks later.  I have a craving that needs to be handled.

K, well I'm off."

"event","Well obviously I haven't really been up to much.  Every time someone online or calls me asks hows my day is going, all I can really say is ""OK"" or ""good"".  When majority of the time its just boring.  I do the same thing everyday wake up, watch t.v., and goto sleep.  I need a hobby.  I was thinking about going to Gold's gym off of Chapel Hill which is the street my development is off from but membership there is to pricey for me.  Not only that I don't need to loose any wieght and its also boring going by yourself.  

I guess it doesn't really matter though. I only have 3 weeks left before I start working over time.  Then for the next 5 months I will be sleeping, eating, working, and repeat.  I told shannon I'll be counting down week by week.

Apparently from what Kyra says she is moving back to Mass in January.  I was kinda surprised cause it was like a random decsion.  So it looks like if she does move I'm not going to be seeing her March.  So I'll probably work on my birthday.

Anyway, some good news.  I'm actually going to be spending time with my cousin Keith this Friday.  I haven't hung out with just him in a long time.  He wanted to come with me to see the movie ""I am Legend""  So after he gets out of work hes gonna swing by my house to pick me up.  Where gonnna go out to eat eithier after the movie or before.  Steph may come too.  She isn't sure though.  She suggested that we go out to eat at TGIF.  But I was like uhh I don't know about that.  Traci also wants to do lunch.  I don't know what day though yet.

Oh yeah, Steph and her friend Nick got our Christmas tree yesterday.  It's not decorated yet.  I don't know when will be doing it.  I do know next week I have to get the house ready because my Aunt Louise from California will want to see our house.

Anyway, I'm off for now."

"event","Well lets see.  I seriously need to start writing in a journal more.  I used to write in it everyday when I lived in Mass.  However, since living down here I just write in it once and a blue moon.

Today, I went to the Olive Garden with my mom.  Unfortuanally I could barely eat.  I had like 2 bites of my Alfrado.  A little bit of salad, and half a bread stick.  Yesterday I only had 8 chicken nuggets and small fry.  I don't know what the hell my problem is and why I don't have an appatite lately.  I'm not sure if its because I'm stressed out right now.  Even though I don't do much right now that doesn't mean things aren't happening in my life.  I'm also worried about one of my friends and I can't do much living down here.  I don't think I'm actually happy.  I guess because I don't know where my life is going.  Everything is so up in the air just in general.  The last thing I need to do is loose anymore wieght.

On an up note I got to actually have a conversation with her.  I haven't talked to her in like a few days.  I have been home by myself all week.  

Steph, and I went to the mall.  I wanted to buy a $169.00 diamond star necklace so I can match it with my Diamond star ring but I didn't.  The last thing I need to do is spend money.

I'm also considering buying the Verizen LG Voyager before I move.  I love that phone and I want it.

Well thats it.  I haven't decided if I want to go to bed or not.  I haven't been sleeping well at all the last few nights."

"event","So as most people know I'm moving to Mass next year.  I can't wait.  I'm scared and excited at the same time.  It's gonna be so wierd moving away from my family.  

Anyway, now that i'm moving and single again.  Guys are all up on me.  It's annoying.  I just want to be single atleast until I move.  Nick's co-worker apparently has a thing for me.  Sopossedly he wants to go to the movies tonight with me.  Nick knows I go every friday.  I told Nick there was no way I was going with a guy I met for like 5 min by myself.  I told him I was only going if him (Nick) and my sister was coming with me.  This guy isn't even my type.  I hate to be mean and be like ""umm yeah I'm not interested.  sorry.""

I gave up on trying to make any friends down here.  I'm very picky.  The whole time I've lived down here.  Traci is about the only friend I have made.  Stephanie was telling me today I was borderline Anti-social.  I just like New England people better.  The guys up their too are WAY better.

Starting the first week of January I will be working 64hrs a week until I move.  I hope it goes by fast."

"event","Ok so I was in Boston a couple weeks ago.  Good Times.  Good Times.  Trust me on that.

Sept 8 (Friday).  Kristene picked me up from Logan.  Her Sister,and MaKayla (her daughter a.k.a my neice) all went to the Roger William Zoo.  For some reason I thought it was bigger.  I guess cause it was years since I had been to the zoo.  

Kristen packed us all a lunch.  Which consisted of Tuna Sandwich, Smartfood, and drinks.  Its was good.  

Later we dropped off her sister.  Then ordered some Papa Gino's.  I was excited (yes I get excited over food).  Especially because we don't have Papa-Gino's Down South. The next best thing down here is Papa John's or a local resteraunt called Fabiono's.  

So the next Day Saturday Day Morning.  Kristene made breakfast for me.  :)  Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Toaste.  It was the works.  

Kristene and I had some errands that day.  We dropped of MaKayla at Kristene's parents house first.  

Then We went to Lowell.  Good ol Lowell.  The stories I could share.  But anyway,  I saw Money.  I hadn't seen him in a year.  He looks older now with a beard but he still looked good.  So we caught up with him.  

We left Lowell after an hour or so and headed over to Olive Garden.  We had some wine.  I had Spagittie with meatballs.  I wish I ordered the Fettichini though.

THen we headed back to Kristene's house grabbed everything we needed for the night.  Then headed to Holiday Inn Express in Milford.

We were ready about 10p.m.  Ryan who works at the Holiday Inn Express came, My friends Angie, and Mari Came.  Also Mari's boyfriend Pablo.  

The Limo came at 10:30p.m. I swear to you I was drunk by then.  It just wasn't so noticble till later.  There was Mari givin Lap dances to Me, and Kristene.  It was all in good fun.  We had our glasses poured with Champaigne.  I drink like 3 glasses in 20 min.  Music was blasting.  Jackass was playin on the screen.  Lap Dances.  It was crazy.

We went to a club in Providance.  All I have to say is we had fun.  ANd if you seen me drunk you know how I am.  So when I entered the club I went to the ladies room first.  I saw someone that really looked formiliar.  ANyway, me being drunk means I'm always EXTRA friendly.  So I was complimented on her outfit.  Mari was behind me and said ""yea it looks nice.""  Then we were out on the dance floor.  Having a blast.  THen I get thirsty.  ANd needed some water.  Kristene was coming back and forth to the bar so many times I couldn't keep track even I was sober.  So Ryan went up there with me.  THen all of a sudden the girl I complimented in the bathroom comes up to me.  SHe was like hey I thought you looked formiliar.  Shes like ""I'm Andy's sister!""  I was like ""No wonder why I thought you looked so formiliar I haven't seen you since June.""  (I saw her for only like one weekend.)  Unfortunally I was so drunk I called her Erica.  When her name is Lisa.  

THen I saw her on the stage dancing later on and I went up there to joined her.  I never danced on a stage in my life.  Thats just not me but.  Actually I take that back I think I might have once and that was in April.

So we left the Club at 1:30 stopped at McD's on the way and then everyone had there own room at the Holiday Inn to Crash at.

It was a great night.  My journal doesn't do the story justice.

The rest of the weekend was pretty mellow.  I was glad I had spent some time with MaKayla and Kristene. 

I went home on Sept 11.  My flight was 30 min delayed.  Anyway I was excited about eating at this resteraunt at Logan because they have really great french Fries and Turkey sandwich.  So there was a line to get in.  There were two gentlemen in front of me and a lady.  We were all a single party.  There was one table with 4 seats.  So they asked us if we didn't mind sitting with each other.  The Lady wasn't having it.  She looked kina snobby.  Then they asked the other two men (who were on seperate business trips).  They said they didn't mind.  ANd then they asked me.  I was hungry.  The guys didn't look sketchy and I'm open-minded.  So I said sure.
I love the random things in life.

So I sat next to a guy named Rick who was about 37ish.  And Jim who was like 65.  Then theres me 21 and a female sitting at the table with two random business men.  It's kinda funny.  So Jim lives in Rhode Island and Rick lives in Wisconsin.  Basically them to were heading to Chicago.  Ramdomly they had the same flight.  They asked about where I was from and what I did.  So we talked about all that.  When we got our food Rick prayed at the table.  Hey whatever it didn't bother me.  Besides I was too busy trying to clean up the ketchep on my shirt.  He asked Jim if he didn't mind.  Of course he said no.  Then later we parted our ways.

So that was my trip.  Sorry it took forever Kristene to write about our adventure.  I noticed I remember what I ate two weeks ago.  Thats crazy.

THe next weekend Andy moved down here.  He drove.  His cousin Rocky came with him.  It's nice having him around.  We do things on the weekends now that I have the weekends off.  I don't really see that much of him MOn-Friday.  

He works 7:30a.m.-4:30p.m and On Wednesdays till 9p.m.  

My Schedule:

Sunday - House work.   

Monday - I have a tutor.  Tutoring me for Algebra 11a.m- Noon.  THen work 
         2-10p.m.

Tuesday - Algebra Class 10:30a.m. - 12:45p.m  Tutoring 12:45-1:45p.m.  Then
          work 2-10p.m.

Wednesday - Work 2-10p.m.

Thursday - Algebra Class 10:30a.m. - 12:45p.m  Tutoring 12:45-1:45p.m.  Then
           work 2-10p.m.

Friday - WOrk 2-10

Saturday - Phlebotomy Class 9a.m. - 1p.m. (the latest)
So this past week I started My classes

So weekends is literally the only time I get to actually spend time with him.  He picks me up just about every night from work at 10.  I make him sandwiches for his lunch.  I do his laundry on Sundays, and vacum his room on sundays.  I enjoy doing it for him.  I know that may sound wierd.  But its just my way of showing him that I care about him.  He cooks Spagetti on Thursday Nights.  I cook Sunday nights.

Tonight he is going to make me hotdogs when I get home.  He drives me around.  He's going to probably pick me up from my Saturday Classes.  I enjoy living with him.  

This Friday will be our 7 month anniversary.  Speaking of which he bought me some gifts a Victoria Secret.  Which basically consists of my favorite Hair Products such as So Sexy shampoo and Conditioner.

So thats whats going on with that.

Like I said my Classes just started this past week.  Basically when I'm at work I do my homework.  I never done so much homework in my life.  The tutur is really helpful.  SHe can break it down and explain to me better and just take it step by step with me.  I understand more about Algebra than I did in April.  For those that don't know I flunked the course.  For some people its easy for me I struggle.  The tutor Costs me about $40.00 a session.  I have her 3 times a week.  I pay out of my own pocket.  HOwever, because I got another session added on MOndays.  That is the only day she pays for.  So I pay for 2 sessions a week.

Today I passed in my Math homework.  It was 11 pages covered from front to back.  I really want to understand it and pass it.  Failure is no option.  I'll do whatever it takes to pass.

I also started my Phlebotomy class.  The class cost $709.00 and that didn't include the book.  I didn't want my mom to pay for it.  So I paid for it.  It broken down into basically 4 semesters of Phlebotomy.  So if I pass this class I start my Second Phlebotomy class In January.  Basically I can't get certified in like 9 months.  I have to go through the 4 sections.  They call it Module 1, 2, 3, and 4.  So it will cost me $619.00 for the last 3 module.  So $619.00 x 3 more Modules = $1857.00 coming out of my own pocket.  That doesn't include the lab coat, or the venipuncture I'm going to need.  I'll need that stuff on the last module because I'll have 40hrs of internship at a hospital.  So while I'm taking this class at Georgia Perimeter College.  I'm taking credit courses at West Central Tech to get an associates in Radiology.  I really want to enter the medical field.  It would also be nice to get paid better while I'm in college finishing getting my associates degree.  Not to mention it will give me the opportunity to have more knowledge to get an associates in Radiology.  Not to mention if you haven't noticed I really want to be a Forensic Pathalogist more than anything.  I want to do something I love and just make something out of myself.  Its really going to be difficult for me.  I know it wont be easy and I certainly don't need people to tell me that.  It makes me sound like I can't be capable of being a Doctor.  I just have to stay motivated and focused.  I know that I'm going to have to do things or homework that I'm not going to like, just like everybody else.  I just have to think of the end result.

Ok sorry to have been rambiling on.  Well I think that covers on what you missed.  Sorry I haven't talked to anyone.

I hope that everyone is doing well.

Talk to you when I talk to you."

"event","First off we had a great time in ATL.  Aquarium amazing..but I have said that before.  Shan, and Stacy loved it.  It definitely was worth the money.  We walked around the underground mall, and we ate our at Hard Rock Cafe. Stacy never ate at one before until that night.  Shannon tried a bite of my veggie burger.  I love them veggie burgers at Hard Rock Cafe.  Then we rode around the train for an hour and half just because.  It was my bad idea lol.  It was interesting.  We played charades that night at the hotel.  We did impressions of some people we knew and didn't like. ANd oh how funny.  Stacy started up that game all because she had mouthwash in her mouth and was trying to tell us something.

South Carolina was amazing.  Despite having our shower head cap at the hotel being held up by string...and having a view of a roof at the hotel.  

The beach was fun!  I finally got a tan.  Shannon got stung by a Jellyfish.  Bad scene.  Water was nice though.  We went clubbing that night at a place called ""Monkey Business""  THe club had great music, what was weird though is that it had all different ages there from 21-40.  I'm not used to seeing older adults at the club.  Also the club was smokey.  It was burning my eyes.  I'm not used to that.  But all in all it really wasn't that bad.  

The next day we went to the beach to get our tan on.  After that we went out to eat and then decided to go to the movies.  We saw ""John Tucker Must Die""  The ending kinda was disappointing but the movie was good.  It brought me back to my old days.  :p  When we came back to the hotel we all went to the beach that night to just chill and relax.

The next day we went to the beach one last time.  THen we headed home on a 5hr car journey.  That night we ate Chinese food.  After that we went to the mall for a little bit.

Shannon would like to come back in either October or November for the weekend. As well as possibly Stacy.

So I definitely have pictures but currently there is something wrong with my scanner at home.  So they will be up a.s.a.p.

My summer still isn't quite over.  ANdy is coming down this weekend.

Next month I'm back in Boston for the weekend.

In the mean time I have been preparing for my up coming classes.

Starting September 28th I start my Algebra class.  I'm already in the process of getting a tutor for that class.  I have always struggled with Math.  It took me two times to pass my Math MCAS in high school.  Its like my worse subject.  I really would like to actually understand the material and pass.  It looks sad that I'm 21 and I need a tutor for a Simple (for most) Algebra class.  But I gotta do what I gotta do.  This is the second time I will be taking this class.  I'm not looking for a 3rd time.

I also enrolled in another college.  Georgia Perimeter College in a certificate program.  I will be taking a Phlebotomy class.  Its ONE in FOUR series of Classes.  So like in December I will have to enroll for the next Phlebotomy program.  All I want to do with my life is achieve something.  Its easy for everybody else and twice as hard for me but I am determined.  I'll do whatever it takes.  Hopefully in the end I'll get what I want.

Well that's it for now anyway."

"event","Well its been a while since I wrote an entry. With work and traviling its hard to find time to keep up with my lj and myspace.  As you know I'm never on AIM eithier do to working literally everday.

I don't really communicate with anyone anymore besides the people I planned or planning on seeing.  Thats sad I know.  It also it doesn't help having a pre-paid phone.  That will change though this Tuesday.  I am back with Verizen and with a really cheap plan.  I got the family share plan with Andy.  Andy plans on paying for our phone bill every month.  Which helps me alot.  He is such a great guy.  Plus  I only owe my mom $2,500.  Which should be paid off in September.  So I paid a little over half of that amount to my mom since I have been really working.  Of course the the debt added up since I left highschool.  THats why its so much.  I was really careless with my money.  Now I'm much more better at budgeting my money.  I'm glad I learned such a valuble lesson well I'm still some what young.  Not where I have a house and its really bad.

As soon as I'm done paying my mom off.  I plan on saving like $3,000 on a car and $1,500 for insurance money.  I'm not planning on getting a car though for a long time.  I find no point in having one when I have no social life.  Its a waste of gas money and car insurance.  It would be nice though to just already have the money for whenever the day comes.  NOw is a good time when I'm working so much.  I think though this fall I will take some type of class that runs once a week on Saturdays.  It's where you practice taking a needle and taking blood out of dead bodies.  So you can take blood out of real people.  I know the name of this I just can't spell that word right now.  Anyway I can get a certificate out of the class.  Plus taking that class will influnce me if I really want to be a medical examiner.  

After this year I will be returning to school for the second time.  Classes will start Jan 3, 2006  It will be a brand new year.  No debt.  Money for a car/car insurance, and money in the bank.  I will have went through one big financial hurtle this year.

So thats a catch up on my life.  Basically nothing has changed.  Just making financial progress.

Anyway NEW YORK.  It was awesome to see Dan!!  I was so happy to see him.  Dan lives in Harlem.  So I stayed over at his place in Harlem for the weekend.  Dan lives with two girls.  I told him it was like Threes Company.  

Friday Dan had to do a few errands.  I was tired cause I didn't sleep all night.  I figure why sleep when I have to get up at 4:30a.m.  So when I went to the airport I wanted to get upgraded to First Class.  It was on my list of things to do before I die.  Yes I have list. It only costed me $35.00.  I was like sweet.  I also got a window seat.  My flight took off at 8:00 a.m.  I only had to sit next to one person and not two.  I had more room. I couldn't believe the leg room I got.  I got complimentry drinks while we waited for the people to board.  Then when they were handing out snacks I had two choices and they weren't little tiny bag of crackers or pretzels.  I got a bag of cookies.  There also another choice.  I forget what it was.

Anyway I landed about 10:45 Dan arrived at 11:00.  Dan had to take the bus to pick me up.  So while we waited for the next bus we grabbed some lunch.  and DAMN it was expensive.  What do you expect though its NYC.  I got to see Dan's tattoo.  It was cool.  Dan and I talked about what we have been up too among other things.

Then after we ate we just caught the bus.  I was like damn good timing.  The bus ride was about 35 min.  So it was slightly passed 12 when we arrived in Harlem.  THen we had to walk a couple blocks.  Anyway the time I got settled in it was almost 1p.m.  Dan had to run some errands.  I took my nap.  I ended up waking up at 5 p.m  After about 30 min we walked 5 blocks to the Grocery Store.  Bought some food for the weekend.  Then after about 30 min of shopping we had left.  I carried 4 bags of grocerys.  Dan carried a gallon of milk, Juice, Soda, and some food.  So we had walked back 5 blocks with all those grocerys.  Then we had to walk up 5 flights of stairs to his apt.  I was soo tired.  We were gonna take a taxi but we decided to save our money. 

After about 35 min we headed to time square.  It was soo cool at night.  I mean I have been there before but it was during the day.  Not at night.  It was awesome.  we eneded up going to the movies to see ""Click"".  Which was a pretty good movie.  We also ordered food there and ate supper while we were watching the movies.  Dan had a $50.00 gift card.  So he was nice enough to use that on me as well.

After the movie got out.  We ended up roaming around Time Square.  We got some ice cream. Then went to Virgin records.  I got Steph a Breakfast Club photo with the frame.  Thats one of her favorite movies.  Then we headed home.  I was out like a light.

The next morning I took a shower and got ready.  We eneded up leaving at 9a.m. to go meet up with some of Dan's friends.  Adam and Stephanie.  They took a Ferry from Long Island.  We went into Time Square again.  We planned on going to see a play.  I wanted to see Phantom of The Opera because its a play I have always heard and saw a movie of.  But it was 66.00 for a ticket.  We deffinitly all couldn't afford that.  So we were gonna go see RENT.  They raffled off tickets for $20.00.  its only good for 2 people.  So I had to write my name down and put the number 2 if I wanted 2 tickets.  So the four of us put our name in however, they only called my name out of all the other people that they called.  So that didn't work out.  Then we went some where, where you can get tickets half off. So we ended up getting tickets for Phantom of the Opera for $33.00.  Before we went to the show we grabbed some lunch.  Then headed over.  The play ened up being disappointing.  I thought it would better.  There were parts of it I liked.  I thought the first half was better than the second half.  Cause second Half I kind of fell asleep.  Because I was half tired and half bored lol.  After that Stephanie had to go back to Long Island.  So we walked her back to the place where you get on the Ferry's or whatever.  Then Adam, Dan and I relized we had a couple hours to kill before we headed over to Port Authority to meet up with Shan and Andy.  We decided that it would be a waste of time and money to go back to Harlem.  So we decided to go to Kmart. lol.  We looked around at games.  I decided that I would buy the game Jenga so we could play something that night.  Then we sat on the couch for the remander of the time we had left.  

When we left we headed over to Port Authority where we met up with Shan and Andy.  It was so good to see them both.  Shannon and I were all over each other that night lol.  Anyway, we took the subway back to Dan's.  We watched some Austin Powers movie that was on TBS.  Then more of Dan's friends showed up.  This guy Jamie, and Amanda.  We all ordered some Pizza.  Which was soo good.  We were gonna go the villige but that didn't happen.  Then we all decided to go bowling.  Then I asked how much it was.  and he said $6.00 a string.  Shannon, and I were like uh no.  Andy, Shan, and I didn't have the money to do that.  Shannon and I are used to 0.25 since a game.  So we decided to watch whatever was on t.v.  Then we played some Strip Jenga but no one ended up getting naked.  WE didn't play long enough.  After we had played.  We all went up on Dan's roof.  It was soo cool.  It was so different then what I'm use to seeing.

Shannon and I decided that because Dan didn't have coke we would just go to the Deli down the street.  Andy came with us.  So we told Dan that we would be back.  We went down and bought Pepsi.  Then we go back to Dan's.  We walk in the first door no problem.  THe second door to actually get in was locked.  So I called Dan 3 times.  But you know if he isn't answering he left his phone the appartment.  So we sat on the Stoops of Harlem.  I look at Shan, and I look at Andy.  I'm like ""I bet all these black people around here are probably wondering what the fuck 3 white people are doing on Stoops in Harlem"". lol.  After 15 min Dan ended up relizing that we probably got locked out.  Basically we were on the roof till about 3a.m.  We all went to bed.

The next morning I got up about 11:15 we were all tired.  about 1ish Dan, Shan, Andy, and I went to Dunkin Donuts to get some food in us.  THen we went to Time Square again.  This time we went to Toys R' Us.  Shannon and I got to go into a big Barbie house lol.  It was awesome.  THat chick and I got pictures.  The guys played some video games and looked at all the boy toys.

About 4:15 we were back at Port Authority to bring back Shan, and Andy.  They just made there bus.  They only had 5 seats left.  If there were another 5 min late that would have had to catch the 6:15 one.

Dan and I went back to Harlem.  Dan crashed as soon as we got to his apt.  I decided that while he was sleeping I would go down the street to wash my clothes.  So thats what I did.

Came back later Dan was up.  We watched Forrest Gump.  I put my Frozen Dinner in the oven.  THey didn't have a microwave.  Then Dan and I went up on the roof and we were up there talking till about 2 a.m.  Pretty much about our weekend and me coming back up and all sorts of things.

The next day I left.  I found out that I was flying first Class on my home.  When I paid 35.00 I thought it was for one way class upgrade turned out to be round trip.  So I was very pleased.  

I arrived back in ATL at 1:30p.m.  I went home and went out with Apyrl my co-worker.  Then went back home and just watched some t.v.

It was a great weekend.  Can't wait till I go back.

However, this Tuesday Andy will be coming down here. His company paid for his flight because he has a class on Tuesday.  So he is really here for his business trip.  But I'm glad I get to see him for the whole day.

Then Wendesday I work 2-10. Thursay I work 2-9 because Shannon, and Stacy are coming down to visit me for a few days.  Thursday night there spending the night at my house.  Friday around 11 mom is gonna drop us off in College Park, GA  Were gonnna Stay at the Holiday Inn Select.  They have a shuttle which will take us back to the ATL airport. At the airport that have the Marta subway that will be taking into Atl.  We plan on going to the Aquarium which is where they have the worlds largest shark and the country's biggest Aquarium.  Will be going to the Underground Mall.  Were gonna eat at the Hard Rock cafe.  Possibly go the club then head back to the hotel later that night.  

At 6 a.m. my mom is gonna pick us up at the Hotel.  From there were heading to Hilton Head, South Carolina.  Were staying at the Hilton Hotel where we are right on the beach.

It's going to be one Fabulous weekend with my girls.

So there you have it.  :)

I will be putting all the stuff I taped in NYC and this coming weekend up on myspace by the end of next week."

"event","Well as always I never know where to begin.  It has been a while since I have written in my lj.

In 3 more days in will be June 1st!  I have worked every week these last 5 weeks over 40hrs.  Don't get me wrong though it doesn't bother me.  I love to make money.  I love to work majority of the time.  Its way better than doing nothing at home.

Sam (my manager), said that he wont hire anybody else for 2nd shift (my shift) unless I want him too.  He or someone will take my days off that I requested off this summer.  I mean I do need a break at some point.  I'm not no energiezer bunny.  Besides I do need to see my friends or I'll have a break down.

So basically June 22-26 I'm spending time with Andy.  Were going to the Cape, as well as going on a double date with shan, and her bf Andy.

July 14-17 I'm going to NYC to kick it with Dan :D.  I haven't seen this kid in like 10-11 months.  I mean I need to see him.  I have seen just about everyone but him.  Shan, and ANdy may come down on the 15th and stay over one night in NYC with us.

July 27 - Aug 1 - Shannon, and Stacy are coming to the Dirty South.  :)  were gonna cause some type of trouble in ATL.  Were also going to go the beach down here probably in Savannah.  Cause I get a hotel discount @ Holiday Inn were gonna stay down there for a couple nights.  

August 18-21 I MIGHT (I'll find out in two weeks) be going to North Carolina to stuff guys in trunks with Priscilla. lol.  haha no were not really gonna stuff any guys in a trunk.  But were gonna cause trouble around there too.  Prissie and I have have been talking online for like 6 years now and were finally gonna meet. 

September 8-11 I'm heading back up to Boston to spend some time with Kristene and my niece MaKayla.  I only have been with MaKayla a couple times.  So I really want to spend some time with her.  I already know that I want to go to the Rogerwilliams Zoo with MaKayla, and Kristene.  I want to take Kristene out to dinner at the top of the Hubb at the Prudential Center also.  Cause I didn't spend time with her on her b-day, or mothersday.  

So I booked all my plane tickets insept for the one in August.  In 3 weeks I'll have about a grand saved up for the summer.  THe rest of the summer I will be just handing my mom my money.  If all goes according to plan.  My debt will be gone in September.

All summer I will be working no less than 40hrs. A couple weeks each month will be overtime.  Then I get my bonus at the end of each month.

This month I gave my mom $823.00 and I spent a grand altogether for my Camcorda/digital camera (all in one), memory card, phone bills, Dinner at the Cheesecake factory (I took my mom, and my sister there for mothersday), and of course plane tickets.

So I made some serious money.

Let me just tell you right now.  If I wasn't working all these hours at the Holiday Inn Express there is no way in hell I would be going anywhere.  I would not be able to do it.  My summer would suck big time.

The majority of you don't have debt to pay.  Not to mention everyone has all there friends in the same area as them.  I don't have a social life.  All I do is work, and goto class.  I'm lonely majority of the time.  So my vacations this summer is all I have to look forward to (which I'm grateful for).  Some of you may think its not a big deal.  But for me its like wow I'll get to see some of my friends and have some what of a little social life.  Some of you may think thats alot of money to to these places.  YOu have to consider though I don't own a car, pay car insurance, pay for gas, or have speding money (when you go out on a regular basis on weekends you spend money)  I don't go nowhere.

So I'm ready for summer ""06"".  For me is gonna be all in all a pretty good summer.  Better than doing NOTHING (which I thought may happen)  Not to mention I'll be spending it with the best people. 

Ok well nuff' about that.  My classes end jUne 16th.  My last math test I got a 72.  Best grade so far.  Although I'll probably need to re-take that class.  What are you gonna do?

Oh and my lap top wireless isn't working.  I'm mega pissed about that.  Because I think the Linksy thing that you plug into the comp on the side broke. GRR. So I need to buy a new one for it to work.  I haven't had time though yet.  So thats why I haven't been on AIM.  And well I am at work so I guess it doesn't really matter.

Well I guess thats all I have to share.  Everyday I work 2-10 insept Tuesday, and Thursday I work 4-10 cause of classes.  

I don't have a tan yet either.  I haven't been out in the sun.  Thats gonna change in 3 weeks.

Well thats really it. It's pretty dull on my end.  SO if I haven't talked to you in a while Message me on myspace or something.  Love to hear from anybody.

I'm still on my pre-paid phone thing.  Thats gonna change in June too.  Andy wants to add me on to like a Family plan.  Were you share minutes.  Then I wont have to pay for my phone.  That will be nice :)

Ok I'm done. 

I Miss everyone!"

"event","So I have just finished working 15 days straight.  I can't believe I have a day off.  Like I don't even know what I am going to do with myself for the next two days.  I guess I'll study.  God knows I need that in the math section.  Maybe I'll clean up my room too.  I haven't really had the time to keep up.  

Oh and I have no more health problems.  You don't know how much stress has been lifted on my shoulders.  Well I still don't know about my future job.  If my now my past health will get in the way of that.  I guess I'll get to that road when I get to it.  I don't want to worry about something when I am not even sure about it.

So I am going to Mass in six weeks.  I almost put months. haha.  I can't wait to see Andy.  As well as go on that double date with Shannon, and her boyfriend Andy.  I can't belive Andy and I are getting matching tattoos.  It's gonna be exciting.  What can I say I'm a free spirt.  I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up marrying him.  Obviously it wouldn't be till I am a few years older, and more mature.  My college education is my first priorty.  I don't want to ever be like my parents trying to make ends meet.  When I was poor back in the day.  I got my clothes at the Salvation Army.  My clothes sure as hell wasn't coming from the mall.  Atleast today we don't worry about trying to make ends meet.  It was just the first part of my life.  Thats why I get scared of not making it through college.  I absoultely refuse to go through what my parents went through.  Unlike everyone else some things are just a struggle with me.  I like to think all the struggles I went through and will continue to go through will only make me stronger.

Some people will never be able to comprehend the things I went through emotionally as a child.  The things I went through with my dad.  Besides him passing away.  The verbal abuse I used to take from my mom.  Cause when your a single parent and you just lost your husband imagine the stress you go through.  I was like her ""punching bag"" so to speak.  No she never hit hit me.  But if I ever did anything wrong I would have to kneel on the floor for like 30min - an hour.  I sure as hell wasn't kneeling on carpet eithier.  When I look back now.  My family as changed so much.  My mom is alot more better as a parent and just as a person.  It just took her a while to Mourn.

I know I have been bringing up my Dad lately.  I think I just miss him.  Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if he was still around.  Would my life be better or worse?  I guess I'll never know.  I mean I accept that my dad is gone.  I mean I always worry about my mom.  See my Grandmother on my moms side past away at 61 or 62.  We have this disease in our family that is called HHT.  It's something like that.  I just runs in the family.  You can't pass it to anyone.  Basically, you can have low iron so you need to take iron pills because your anemic.  Well on top of that condition I belive my grandmother had some type of internal bleeding.  Ok, some of you know I get random nose bleeds (which runs in the family).  Well its like that but its just internal.    Well you know thats always made me worry about my mom.   Now that she is getting older.  She was 20 something and she had to basically feed, bathe, and groom my grandmother.  I would do the same for my mother.  It just sucks having one parent sometimes.  Cause if anything happen to her god for bid (especially if I am still in my 20's) I don't know what I would do.  When I was 12 and my mom got her goude (however, you spell it) bladder out, and she was in the hospital.  I was worried.  My mom also used to smoke the doctors said if she didn't quit soon she wouldn't live much longer.  She used to get sick with Broncitious all the time.  I was worried.   When she has gotten 3 hr nose bleeds I get worried.  If she was never back when she said she would be and it would be like 2hrs later with no phone call.  I would be worried.  My mom is all I have.  She has been there everytime I needed her.  Even though she can get on my nerves, and we have some big fights like when I moved out.  At the end of the day I know she would be there for me.  She has done so much for my sister and I.  Like take us on nice vacations like going on a cruise.  Going to California, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texus, New Orleans, and etc.  My mom wanting to get nice things for us..cause we couldn't afford them when we were younger.  She wanted us to expierence life at our feet, to be open-minded, to gain knowledge from first hand expiernce, to learn somthing from whatever we did.  I really couldn't ask for a better parent.

I guess I should be lucky though that I have gotten to know my dad.  Stephanie does't remember really anything about him.  I'm just glad everday that our mom is still here.

I miss my Grandpa too.  We used to see him, my nana, and my uncle every sunday for like 17 years.  My nana, and grampa didn't leave us in the will.  There giving everything to my Uncle, and my cousin Jen.  I guess my gramps didn't like how my mom spent my dad's money that he had left us.  My grandpa is wierd.  He holds grudges. Stupid or not.  If my grandpa is didn't put my sister and I in the will because he is trying to ""punish"" my mom.  I still love them.  Money is weird.

I haven't talked to my Uncle in like a year almost.  When I was sick he never came and visited my mom, or I that last weekend we were in Mass.  Instead he went with his neighbors camping somewhere.  

When my gramps was in the nursing home.  And my gramps sat in a soiled chair, and my mom told me the next day about it.  I hauled my ass down there and bitched those nurses out and filed a complaint.  My uncle was pissed.  I'm like that his dad and he don't even care.  Fuck that.  My dad would be so pissed at my uncle.  My mom thinks I should call him.  I'm like you do it.  But she is like your his neice.  I'm like well hes your sister-in law.  THen she tells me that I'm his neice and I should be more maturer than him. haha. ok.  I am soo mad at my uncle and my cousin Jen.  I hated how my cousin Jen called our grandparents by there first name.  What kind of respect is that?!

Sometimes I wonder if our grandparents, my uncle, and my cousin Jen treat my sister, and I different cause My father isn't here.  Sometimes I wonder if my mom wasn't here would my mothers side of the family treat my sister, and I different.  I swear to god my closest friends are more of like a real family then my own blood.  Besides my mother and sister.

God this turned out to be some what of a depressing entry.  Sorry.  I don't really talk about my family one on one with anyone.  If I do I get all choked up.  Anyway, thats part of the reason why I am always worry about my future financially, and the people in my life that I hold so dear.

Its amazing that I can get through all this and that.  But I wouldn't know where I would be with out my friends.  I miss them so damn much.  For christ sake by the end of the year I will have possibly flown 4-5 round trips by the end of the year.

well I am all done.  Night."

"event","So I'm sitting here munching on oreos and drinking a glass of milk.  Kicken back.  Well I guess I'll start with work.  Basically my life is consumed around work.  By next tuesday I will have worked like 15 days straight.  One of the those days was a double shifter.  15 and a half hours.  

I have ALWAYS been a workocholic.  I have like 4,382 dollars left to pay off.  It includes my lap top which was about 1800.  Some past rent, doctors, stuff that just added up.  I also have 319.00 left to pay for a phone bill.  200 dollars was for canceling with next Nextel.  So with the phone bill all together I have about $4,600.  

Grantide.  I do have $650.00 in my savings which will never be touched.  Anything goes into the savings is going towards Mass.  I also have $331.00 sitting in my checking account.  Anything that will be put in my checking account goes to airtran, spending money for when I go to Mass, NYC (to see Dan), and NC (To see Prissie).  I'm not going to be shopping for clothes, buying purses, or getting my hair done.  Basically if I am down here; I'm not speding with whatever is in my debit account down here.  Unless its something I acutally NEED.  Not because I want it.  

I did get PRE-approved by Bank of America for $1000.00 So I guess I'm getting a credit card.  Those motherfuckin things scare me.  I told Andy I was leaving it at home so I don't get the urge to use it (not like I go anywhere anyway).  The only time the credit card is coming out of my bedroom is when I fly out of state.  Basically the card is only for an emergency.  So like if I'm in Mass or NYC...or NC and something happens god for bid atleast I have that.  Cause I would have no other money on me.

So yeah I don't want to burry myself in more debt.  Especially with a credit card.  That would be worse.  

So next week.  I have like Tuesday, and Wednesday off.  I'm soo pissed. I wanted to work.  Hey I need the money.  Shit.  He is training someone for my shift.  I don't know of course though if she will take my job for like part time.  2 or 3 days.  I'm telling you.  The bitch better not get more than 3 days.  I need atleast 32 motherfuckin hours.  I told Sam She better work Sat, Sun, and Tuesday.  That way when I request my weekends off.  I'm only askin for 1 or 2.  Instead of 3 or 4.  I don't know will see how that goes.  

Seriously though, I would have worked everyday (besides the days off that I requested.  June 22-26, July 14-16, July 22- Aug 1st.  Aug 18-20, Sept 8-10, and two other days of in sept for whenever Andy comes down here.)  Your probably like what the hell do you need all those days off for.  Well in June I'm going to Mass to see Andy.  In July I MIGHT go see Dan; however, I wont know that in like two weeks.  Also in July Shannon..and possibly Stacy may come and visit me.  In August I'm gonna go see my friend Prissie in NC.  I wont know that for sure till June.  Thats only if she gets the time off.  She just started working at on*star.  Then in September I'm going back to Mass to see Kristene, and spend some time with my neice McKayla; and that is Gaurenteed.  Atleast I'll get a free one way ticket out of all these round trips I'm taking.  I told Sam all these days already.  I told him that I wanted a fairly good summer.  Seeing how I'm extremely lonely down here.  He has given me every day off that I needed.  Not once thought twice about it.  He told me today not to worry about it.  Some of you are probably don't think thats alot of days off.  But this is the hotel business its not like you work in a big department store and its easy for someone to cover you.  Because if this new future employee can't work it.  He has too.  Cause the morning shift people can't do check-ins.  And the night audits well there night audits.  One of them works 3 jobs.  Including the Holiday-Inn.  

I'm not quite sure if Cathy knows that I get a bonus or not.  Cause none of the employees are soposse to know.   Cause last week she was like ""Sam better be paying you overtime.""  I told her ""I'm not.  My choice though.  Cause if he had to pay me over time he would just work.""  Cathy looked at my funny.  I was like ""Well I really need the money.  So it was eithier work 40hrs and not get paid anymore than that or work more hours and get paid more.  Just no overtime.""  She was like ""So he doesn't give you money under the table?""  I lied and said ""No.""  Cause my Bonus is under the table.  Then I said. ""Sam just pays me 8.00 an hour and it goes straight to my check.  Nothing more than that.""  Like I like Cathy but she is so nosey.  It's not even her business how hes paying me or if I'm getting paid overtime or not.  She first of all works 3rd shift.  So its not like I'm cutting into her hours.  2nd shift is my shift.  I run that shift.  

THen last night she was like.  ""I think I'm gonna ask Sam if we can all get bonus's at the end of the month.  I don't think He'll go for it. But I was thinking that he could give us a littel extra depending on how the Hotel does.""

I was thinking wtf.  See Sam left me some money in this box mixed with the Dorito's and Cookies.  Cause I make goodie bags for P.C members of the hotel.  I was so busy that night.  Sam couldn't acutally hand  it to me before he left.  I assumed he was just gonna give it to me the next day.  So of course I didn't get a chance to make the ""goodie bags"" and Cathy came in went by the box and clocked In.  THen I clocked out and for some reason I check the box.  I was like OHH my money.  To myself of course.  So I don't know if Cathy saw it and didn't say anything.  ANd then when she ended up making the ""goodie bags"" noticed it was gone.  SO now assumes something is up.  

I told sam about it.  Cause I didn't want him thinking I was telling everybody that I got a bonus.  Cause he told me not to mention it to anyone.  Cause I'm the only employee that gets that. 

Bottom line.  I HATE discussing money with employees.  Its not my business what they make or what I make.

So I'm gonna switch gears here and bring up Algebra.  I hate that fuckin subject.  First test I got was 49.  Second test was 60.  I'm like so pissed.  Its so frustrating for me.  I feel so stupid.  I so struggle in that subject.  All my friends are extremely smart, and I can't even comprehend some simple Algebra/Geometery.

Most people don't know that I was in Special Ed.  I have NEVER brought it up in my LJ till now.  So if you didn't know you now know.  It's not something I am proud of.  I find it to be embarrising, and shameful.  One of my teachers in like 4th grade though didn't think I would be able to attend college.  Fuck that bitch! If I can't even get this subject.  What about future subjects?  If I have to take this class over again I will.  I know there are times I want to quit.  But I HATE FAILING OR GIVING UP.   I'm not gonna let some bullshit math get in the way of my dream.  I don't want to be poor my whole life..or working at a minumum wage job.  I want to have an unlimted future full of possibilites.  I guess I'll have to study harder.  I know I had to take Math MCAS like 3 times to finally pass.  English took me two times to finally pass.  So I was able to get my Diploma.  Thank God.

Theres two opposite sides of the track in my family.  One the Burkle side.  My Gramps dropped out of HighSchool.  My dad went to Bently Collge in Virginia and dropped out.  My Uncle only graduated Highschool, my cousin gradutated highschool, flunked out of college,  and then only got her nursing license, and my Nana was a stay a home mom.  My Dad, and my Nana were EXTREMELY bright people.  But my dad well thats something I can't get into.  I'll just say he got side tracked.  Maybe one day I'll be brave enough to tell that story.  But right now I'm not.  

Then you have the Fitzwater side.  My Uncle John has a Masters Degree, Jason a Bachalors degree in Business, Keith Bacholars in Computer Technology, Matt a bacholors in Art, My Aunt Loise got her bacholors as a Dentel Hygentist, My Mom Bacholors in Business, My grandmother was a Nurse, and I don't know what Gramps did.  I never met them.  Basically they all went to college and all have degrees.  They all strive for sucess, and they all work extremely hard for what they earn.  My Uncle was VP of BF GOODRICH and now owns his own company.  I like don't even compare to any of them.  There were always like ""When are you going to start college?""  Blah blah blah.  Not to mention none of them went to a Communtiy or Technical College.  

Both familys have one thing in common were workholics.  I just don't have the education part down.  I'm working on it.  The good news is.  I got an 82 on and English test.  I'm just stressed about Math.  :(  Everyone has the future practically secure by now..and I wonder if I'll ever make it out alive.

Well on other news I should be getting a call from my doctor today.  I wonder what news she'll bring me from my tests.  Oh dear.  Oh dear.

My butt aches.  I'm out."

"event","I'm totally against illegal immagrants.  Not because of their heritage.  Its because 1.  There breaking the Law.  2. WHat about all there fellow mexican people who are legal and who waited.  WHat makes them so fucking special that they should automatically get citenzship when everybody else had to wait to get theres?  The majority of them don't even speak fuckin english.  Most peopele that have come here and are a legal United States American citizens speak english.  Not to mention they busted there ass to get that citezenship.  Which I totally respect.  And these mother fuckin illegals just want shit handed to them.  Im sorry but no matter what you do you have to struggle for what you earn in life.  Nothing gets handed down to you.  

Here they are in the streets making threats to us.  Saying that the American People are Racist.  Why because we belive in following the law?  We welcome all nations.  

I was watching C-Span even mexican people who are now citizens don't even agree with what there fellow mexicans are doing.  To them its like a slap in the face.

First of all they have no right to complain if there not even american.  Go back to your own country and complain or wait for your turn.

Not to mention there making threats to our enconmy.  Is that how you get what you want by making threats?  Is that a way you get through life.  Why don't you threaten your own country?  If this is the way you try to get the things you want in life by making threats whos to say we want you in our country.  God knows the kind of leaders we would out of them.  

Not only do I belive as well as some of there fellow American Hispanics who worked there way here want someone like that living in our country.  Not only are they disrespecting our country they have no loyality.

There was this lady who called in From Illinoi who is a DR in ER she says she sees Illegal Immagrants getting free health care because they don't have fuckin health insurance, nor do they get paid enough.  And here Iam an AMERICAN CITENZEN 21 years old paying fuckin $4000.00 for my health situation.  Wow I should have just been and illegal immagranat and shit maybe I can get free health care. Fuck you.  

They slap all americans in the face that vote, and all  mexicans who busted there ass getting that citizenship, as well as other countrys who bust there ass to earn there citizenship.

Hey were welcoming all countrys as long as you play by the law.  This is our home.  You have to respect our home.  Like would we respect yours.  You don't have the right to jump in line.  When others are trying to legally work hard for there citizenship.  

Illegal Immigration = ILLEGAL.  Get that.

I mean its some of our fault too.  We shouldn't be hiring them to do certain jobs.  Alot of Mexican, hispanic people are in the  Construction business right now.  A guy who earned his citizenship doesn't want to be put out of a job because there taking over.  I can't blame him.  Its not right.  We shouldn't even be tolerating that there breaking the law. 

Those that hire these illegal immagrants are paying the min. wage.  I know that those illegal immagrants who are in construction get paid shit for what they do.  Just because there illegal.  If they were legal they would probably get paid better.  Those that also hire should get some sort of penelty for what there doing.

Another guy said his Aunt is from Columbia it took her two years to get a visa tourist just to visit her family..  But she didn't fly to Mexico and go over the border to Florida to see her family.  She waited her turn.

Shit if we let all these immagrants in with a FREE pass.  The whole fuckin world will want a free pass.  Then what are we gonna say ""I'm sorry we only did that for the mexicans.  We can't do that for you.""  That wouuld be fucked up.   We can't fit the whole world in OUR country.  

Our leaders need to get this shit in control and so something about this mess.  Its partly there fault too for not having a gate on the border.  We are finally putting one up and securing our boarder.  Not to mention.  We should have been enforcing the laws.  We have been giving them a slap on the wrist.  We let them get away with it..as well as takin advantage of the U.S.  So we have ourselves to blame for that.  Well I should say our goverment..and those that hire the immagrants, Health Care professoinals that give them free health care,   and etc.

Fuck them illegals who want that free pass.

I know some people disagree with me.  Its a contorversy subject.  But I do respect anyone that does have a different opion than I."

"event","So if your reading this then your well aware that I have a new phone.  Let me tell you how I came to that decsion.  So since I have moved my mom was just paying my monthly phone bill.  Of course I have to pay her back.  It was while I was out of a job too cause I had just moved and other issues.  

I didn't relize that I was paying between 80-140 dollars a month on my phone.  Last bill I got was 228.00!  I thought I was gonna die.  I didn't relize I used the phone that much.  Plus I talked to Andy alot as well.  The next bill and last bill I will get will be 140 something.  I can not believe it.  So I before I found that out.  I decided I was gonna go with cingular only because from what I have searched online was the best one.  Not to mention Andy, Kristene, and Byn have cingular.  So I can talk to them for free as much as I want.  As for everybody else there just gonna have to call my phone..and I'll have to call them back eithier from work phone, or my sister's cell phone after 9p.m. or on the weekends.  

I only have to pay like 25 dollars a month.  Or I can just wait till the end of June to pay cause the minutes will expire then.  However, if I do pay every month my min will just rollover.  I can sign up online (once I get my debit card) and my bill can be automatically paid on a certain day every month.  They just deduct it from my checkings account.

Speaking of Checkings account.  I went to Bank Of America earlier this past week and opened an account because I haven't had once since I have been here.  But now that I get a bonus every month it will be going into my savings account and some of it into the debit account.  I give all my work checks to my mom.  Which goes to the doctors bills and other bills.  Which should all hopefully be paid off by either July or August.  Or I will shoot myself.  The only reason why I opened with them though was because there goning to be sending me a check of 75.00 just because I opened with them.  I was like sweet!

I am usually always a big spender and my motto use to be ""Money is no option"" and thats part of the reason why I am where I am but not fully do to some of my health issues.  That wasn't something I could control financially.  But I am starting to try to be more financially mature.  Like I haven't had a any credit cards.  And I'm trying to plan out my expenses and all that stuff.  And what I need to save to move to mass.  I need atleast 6000.00 dollars.  Thats my goal.  10,000 is my main.  I am trying to make it atleast realistic.  It all depends on how much I want to kill myself workin.  I just really want to get out of debt and actually have money.  

Will see what happens.  But I estimated that I will atleast save 500-800 dollars just by paying much lower phone bill.  which is great.  For me thats alot.

So today I have a doctors appointment. Yeah I'm scared.  And I have to wait like 2 weeks for like results.  Thats a bitch.  I'm not gonna be able to sleep. Its gonna drive me nuts.  I was doing ok since like January because not seeing the doctors helped me put my situation on the back burner.  But now its back in the front.  So to speak.

Work has been ok.  Next 2 weeks I work 102 hours all together.  Nobody better take my hours.  I need that money. I love working only cause I get money.  This weekend is Tallageda weekend.  Its like a big race weekend that they have in Alabama (which is 45 min away west of me).  And were gonna be like sold out..and I'm working that WHOLE weekend.  I'm soo dreading it.  

Even tonight I was busy.  I get headaches.  I like working at a steady spead.  Not where my lobby is over crowded with people.  So thats it.  Atleast tonight I get to work til 2-9 and not 2-10.  I'll be GLAD to leave tomorrow.

Well I'm off.  I REALLY need sleep."

"event","Well I guess today I just don't know how to start off with this journal.  I have been thinking about alot of stuff lately.  My friends, Andrew, guys in just general, my health situation, me not being in mass, classes, and work. 

Well I guess I'll start of with my friends.  I miss everyone like whoa.  Especially Shannon cause she is my BESTFRIEND, Dan cause I haven't seen the kid since september, Kristene, and my niece.  Those people are like the only people I really ever need in my life.  Not that I don't think of my other close friends as important people.  Cause I do.  THey just know me inside and out practically.  I haven't made any friends down here.  Because I just started classes, and I'm the youngest one at work. So.

Aside from meeting Shannon (whos been the best thing in my life).  Andy is the other best thing in my life.  He is just always there for me.  He understands my current Health situation.  He just purchased a round trip ticket for me to come see him in June.  Basically he takes care of me wheather its financially, or just emotionally.  Long Distance isn't really that difficult for us because we talk on the phone just about everday for a few hours.  At the end of everyday he is the only one I want to be with.  He knows that I'm a natural flirt.  I think I have toned that down...but like I always have said in the past.  <font size=12>Just because I flirt.  Doesn't mean I'm interested.</font size=12>

So my outlook on guys.  Well where do I start with this one? haha.  Well you know Andy and I have been been together since March.  He is the longest relationship I have ever had.  So its deffinitly different from being single.  I was single practically my whole life.  But that was always my choice.  Cause 

1. I'm Picky. 
2. Guys are assholes anyway 
3. Guys just want ass. 
4. They amuse me...and always will.

Well, lateley for a while now since I have moved I found more guys have been hitting on me..from mass than when I was there.  I would like to know how that hell that worked.  Well actually it didn't start until January...when I went up there to visit friends.  I don't know if its cause I wear my hair down alot more than when I used to..or what. haha.  Did I get more attractive?  I don't get it.  But sure.  Maybe its cause they <font style=Bold>think</font style=Bold> they can get ass..and then I would be on my way back to Georgia.  Please I don't trust guys (besides andy and very few others) as far as I could throw them.  

Before Andy I never really treated guys that great.  They just didn't know it.  The trick is not making it obvious.  And if your a guy reading this.  You probably don't have a clue what I'm talking about.  Lets just say that I can be manipulating..and tell guys what they want to hear.  But at the end of the day it would be all bullshit. I'm not saying that was true for every guy I have dated in the past before Andy..but there is a good chance that I did.  I mean I was always kind of like that.  I NEVER liked to get attached. I would never chase a guy eithier..nor will I ever.  I would just replace them.  

One of my friends the other day said I use to treat guys like they were a conquest.  Cause once I had my eyes set on someone that was it.  Then If I got something from a guy (no not sex sorry), or If I knew I could get whoever at the time then I would move on.  I thrive on challenges.  There is nothing more exciting than that.  (why do you think I'm with Andy?)

I know your probably like ""thats kind of fucked up""  But you have to understand I never use to be like.  When I was younger and I really did like a guy.  I got treated like shit.  Nathan really topped it off though.  So before Andy.  I was the way I was because of shitty asshole guys. So you can thank them for me.  If anything they made me a stronger person, and not so neive.

I think it got worse after Nathan.  Nathan was the first guy I loved..and actually put my heart in.  I thought I knew what I was doing and I wasn't gonna fall for him...cause nope I wasn't like that.  HAHAH yeah ok...I ended being the one getting disceaved.  Only it was way worse than what I ever did to a guy.  Then I think after him...I was worse to other guys because I surpressed all my feelings about him.  I only cried over him once when I was sober.  Then I cried about him In June of last year and this past March when I was drunk.  I don't like to cry never mind it being over a guy.  Fuck that.  

So its just amazing being in a relationship with Andy.  He is everything I could ever want in a guy.  There is just nobody better than him in my eyes.  I wouldn't give him up for anything or anyone.   I'd be a fool to let a great guy go.  Hes the reason why were together.  I knew he was one of the rare good guys out there.  So I couldn't pass him up.

So do I miss the single life?  No cause I'm with Andy.  The only thing that is wierd is not really flirting with other guys like  I used to.  It was like part of an everyday life for me.  Nothing great.  But like I said its wierd.  But it doens't bother me.  Cause like I said earlier in the entry.  At the end of the day all I want and need is him.

Priscilla and I were talking last night.  O my gosh I love her.  I needed to get some things off my chest..that I really couldn't tell anybody..not that its bad.  But just certain things. It felt great.  Thanks!

So Algebra..ughh I hate that class.  That class makes me feel stupid.  

I am gonna be working the next 4 weeks with no days off.  My choice though.  I need the money.  Especially with me keep going to mass, and moving back up next year.

As far as my health sititaution.  I have an appointment next month.  Hopefully all goes well, or I'm pretty fucked.  Andy, and my friends have been totally supportive of me..and I just want to say thanks.  Especially Andy for being a great guy and just understanding about the whole sitution.

So that is my rant today."

"event","So Thursday (March 30th) my mom picked up Andy at the airport. Then around 11 my mom came and picked me up.  Andy walked in though to get me. He met my my co-worker Cathy.

He saw my crummy apartment at the time.  He ended up sleeping on the couch.  Before we went to sleep we just catched up.

The next day Friday we just moved all the stuff from the apartment to the house.  The Cable lady came and hooked up the internet and the cable sooner than I thought.  Like the day we moved.  Later on that night we went out to this japennesse place where they cooked the food in front of you.  It was awesome.  

Saturaday our fridge came.  We unpacked boxes.  Later on we went out for dinner with my Aunt and Uncle.  Then we came home.  

Sunday we did more unpacking.  Around 6ish Andy, My sister Steph, and I went out to the movies.  We saw the Inside Man.  It was a pretty good movie.  Then my mom decided we should rent a couple of movies so we did.  I rented ""DeRailed""  which was ok.  Also ""Dark Water""  which sucked ass.  We all just saw Derailed though that night.

Monday we dropped Andy off at the airport.  Then I had to work.  It was totally wierd coming home and him not being there.  :(

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So April 4th I started classes.  FINALLY!  I attend West Central Technical College.  Right now I am taking two classes.  English and Algebra.  I completely suck as Math.  So that will be interesting.  I talk to this girl named Charmane who sits next to me in English.  She is wicked nice.  Then there is this girl infront of us who I also talk to.  She happens to be in my Algebra class to.  So she sits next to me as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the majority of you know.  I went to Mass/Rhode Island this past weekend.  April 7-10.  Shannon, and Brandon picked me up at the airpot at 5p.m. Friday.  We got Pizza at Logan.  For the first time I had olives on my pizza as well as tomatoe.  It was interesting.  I think Shannon, and I freaked out Brandon because to him whatver Shan and I had talked about made no fucking sense to him.  

Her and I have this friendship and this communication where all we have to do is look at each other say a couple words and know exactly what were talking about.  I love the girl to death.

Brandon says were both on Crack.  HAHA.

Later that night about almost 10p.m.  Shannon's dad took Shan, Paul (her brother), and I for drinks.  We went to the Emerald in Worcester. Her first drink was a Bahamma Mamma on her 21st birthday just like me!  (I just relized that now! haha) I couldn't really drink that night.  My stomache wasn't in the mood.  For those that don't know.  My 21st birthday was two weeks ago and I ended up puking so.  Not to mention I really can't drink anyway for temperary health reasons.   So oh well.  

So back to my story.  Shannon got a little drunk.  It wore off the time we got home.  However, after we went to the Emerald we went to two more bars in Worcester.  Also shannon, and I played KENO for the first time.  I payed cause it was her bithday.  Although we both lost. :(

After we came home we talked to her brother.  It was actually the first time I really talked to him that about stuff.  Nothing like personal.  But just an actually conversation.

Saturday was such a crazy day.  Shannon, and I ended up over at Kristene's about 2:30p.m.  I finally met my niece MaKayla.  Which is Kristene (who is one of my dear and closest friends) daughter.  MaKayla deffinitly looks liker her father Stevie.  It was so weird holding a baby.  I literallly haven't held a baby since I was 6.  And that was my sister I held.  I was afraid I was going to drop the baby.  MaKayla is so beautiful though.  I spent the time catching up with Kristene as well.  I miss that girl.

At 3:15 we headed to B.K to meet up with my boyfriend Andrew.  I went with him to Fall River.  While Shannon met up with her Boyfriend Andrew at his friends house.  (Yes both of us have a boyfriend named Andrew.)  Ironic I know.  I was actally a little nervous meeting Andy's family and friends.  I just wanted them to like me.  But I just acted like myself of course.  

Andy's parents seem wicked sweet.  His friends Nick, Mike, and his cousin Rocky are just a riot.  We all went bowling.  I had a lot of fun.

Before though I met Andy's parent's and friends he took me out to eat at this Itlian resteraunt.  It was pretty good.

After bowling around 9ish we headed to Providence to meet up with Shan and everyone at Stacy, and Stef's place.  We got there about 10:30.  Andy and I walked in and there were mad bitches everywhere and one other guy.  Which was Stef's boyfriend.  All the girls were extremely nice and they were just having fun.  Shannon, Mandi, Erin, and Shannon's boyfriend Andrew showed up.  I was so excited to finally meet Mandi.  See this girl and I have been talking since January online and a couple times on the phone.  We didn't get to meet in Jan.  So we were totally excited to meet that night.  Hopefully we get to hang again in the future.  Her friend Erin is totally cool as well.  I get along with like everyone so.

When we all got to the club it was almost like midnight.  I met up with Angie, Mari, Leah, and Kerrie.  Then Mandi's friend Chris and a ccuple of other of his friends showed up named Grahm, and Some other guy.  Anyway.  I kinda spreaded myself around as much as possible.  Everyone was spread out.

I didn't drink that night.  Shannon got a little buzzed.  So did Mandi.  Everone was pretty sober. If not atleast buzzzed.  I had alot of fun at the club.  After we went to the club we went out to Coffee and Cream.  Insept for Stef, her boyfriend, Stacy, and some of there friends.  It was just My boyfriend, Shannon's boyfriend, Mandi, Erin, Chris, and those two other guys.  

The next morning.  We went to YOLKs.  Stacy, My boyfriend, Donny, Megan, Erin, Mandi, Shannon, and Kristene.  Kristene showed up with MaKayla!  MaKayla was right next to me.  

Megan left a little early.

After we all ate Kristene took off.  She had to do some errands.  Donny also had to leave to.  He had stuff to do with his uncle.  I was kinda bummed out.  I was hoping that he would have hung out with us longer.

Everyone else went back to Stacy's.  We went to go look at movie times for the movies in Lincoln.  We ended up going to see BenchWarmers.  It was a funny movie but really no plot to it.

After the movies we went to stacy's to drop her off.  THen I said goodbye to Andy.  Then we all went home.

Shannon, and I did some homework.  Although she had way more than I did.  She has more classes.

Today, Andy picked me up at Shannon's house around 10.  We actually just hung out for like an hour and a half.  Shannon had classes today from 9-4ish.  So thats why I hung out with Andy.  He took the day off work to spend it with me.

Anyway, around 11a.m. we went to Walmart to pick up Shan's and my pictures.  Then we headed to Marlboro.  we went to the Regal Cinames to see ""Ice Age: The Melt Down""  It was pretty funny.  THen about 2 p.m. went to the Olive Garden.  Of course I ate all my food.  Andy calls me an eating machine.  haha.  I like to eat what can I say?  THen we went to the store.  I bought him a picture frame.  I have a wicked cute picture of us that I wanted him to put in a frame.

Then about 5 he dropped me off at Shannon's.  He met her parents.  Then we went outside and we said our byes.

Shannon dropped me off at the airport.  My flight was pretty good.  

The weekend went by so fast.  I kinda cried last night cause I am gonna miss Shannon, Andrew, and my closest friends.  My life isn't the same with out them.  I appreciate the time I get to spend with them.  It's hard but I am dealing with it.  There really isn't a choice in the matter.  

Shannon, and Stacy plan to come down and see me in July.   Andy is planning on Purchasing my ticked for a weekend in June to come see him.
Serioulsy Andrew has done so much for me.  He literally went out of his way for me.  I know its because he wanted to and it was his choice.  He's the first guy thats actually payed attention to me.  Without smothering me of course.  And I am not even talking about the sexual stuff.  I just mean emotionally he pays attention to what I say.  I'm so lucky to have him.  I mean what guy pays over 500 dollars just to see me and take me out?  Not many (I'm talking about the ones that can actually afford it too).  He is just great.  I appreciate him so much.  He's very speacial to me.

Well tomorrow I have class at 1:15p.m.  I have to finish up that homework now.

Thanks for the fun memories guys.  <3 can't wait to do it again!"

"event","So as most of you know This past Monday (March 13th) was my 21st birthday.  I didn't do anything exciting.  Later I went out with my mom to have a few drinks.  By the time I left I was kinda drunk.  I had 2 Bahamma drinks, 1 Strawberry Dquarie, 1 Strawberry Margarita, and some other drink that was wicked strong.  Then came hom and drink like 12oz of mudlside.  I was online drunk and Iming some people.  I ended up calling Brandon and I talked to him like an hour and a half on the phone..and the other hour and half online.  He kept telling me to go to bed.  I was like NO.  Also made some random text messages..then decided to call Byn at like 4:30a.m.!  He just laughed at me.  Although after we started talkin for few min.  I started to cry..I guess cause I was lonely and it was my 21st Birthday and pretty much spend the day alone.  But he cheered me up.  I ended up falling asleep with him on the phone.

Then last night omg..Mom dropped me off at Uncle John's company.  So I met up with Matt and Keith there.  From there we went and headed towards atlanta.   We had to stop at there apartment first.  Keith needed to iron a shirt.  Matt and I decided to stop to the liquare store.  The place was packed.  I got a large bottle of Strawberry Margarita already mixed. A little bottle of Absolute Vodka...and some red bull enegery drink.  (I'm so hungover right now talking about drinks is makin me sick to my stomache.)  Then we came back.  Matt needed to take a shower.  I called up Andy before I left.  Then Matt decided that we should walk to the bars.  Because none of us wanted to drive drunk.  Plus they live right in the city..so.  We tried going to Taco Mac but the place was just way to crowded.  So we went across the street to some other place.  We ended up getting supper (note* that dinner was the only thing I ate the whole day).  Kieth got me a Vodka and Redbull.  For him and I.  He just ordered my drink.  Now I can't even smell redbull or drink.  Thinking about now makes me want to head towards the bathroom.  Ok so anyway...then I ordered Vodka with Orange juice and Cranberry juice.  Then I ordered a ginatonic.  (Ok I deffinitly just went to the bathroom and puked).  **The last time such a HORRABLE hangover was Columbus Day 2004.  Only that still tops that off..cause I was at the toilet for 45 min that year.**  Last night was like 10 min.  Ok anyway, back to what I was saying.  Keith was lucky they served him because he forgot his wallet..so he didn't have his ID on him.  

After we head left the place.  We took a cab back to their apartment so he could get his wallet and then headed back.  Then we stopped at a cigar store cause thats what Keith and Matt wanted.  Matt found something.  Keith didn't.  So  Keith ended up getting some cigarettes from this gas station.  He hasn't smoked cigarettes in like months.  

After that we headed towards another bar.  I got a strawberry Margarita on the rocks.  The glass was tall and the Drink was strong.  We ended up playing some Cigarette game where you have the plastic mostly off the cigerette box..and the penny is in the middle of the plastic.  And you have to be the one that doesn't have the penny fall throught the plastic and hit the table.  I won cause Keith made the penny drop!  After that Keith went outside...and then I don't know what we were talking about..but somehow I brought up Nathan.  I started balling..and Keith comes in and was like ""what the hell is going on...you alright?""  Matt was like yeah she is fine.  

See they used to bring up Nathan all the time..and call him a ""canook"" cause he is from canada...and like playing around and teasing me.  Everytime they find out about some guy eithier through my mom or my sis and they say something..my cousins start blowing it way out of porportion.  ANd start ragging on me.  So I guess I was telling Matt that I really didn't like that..and I told him what happened between Nathan and I.  Matt was like ""I'm sorry I didn't know...he was like I wont bring it up again.""  Then I guess I told Matt not to mention anything to Keith or Uncle John.    Then thats when Keith came in.

Anyway right after Keith came back I was fine.  We ended up going to another bar. Before we got in though.  We were outside in line.  ANd I was talking to this girl cause I could tell my cousins were checking her out.  So I just started talking.  I don't know what we talked about.  I think she isn't originally from Georgia..and I told her neithier was I..and junk like that.  I forgot all about that till now.
When we got inside I bought a screw driver.  Keith got a beer.  I don't know what matt got.  Some how though we ended up loosing Matt.  Cause he told me today that he was like 5 ft away from us..3 girls wanted him to take a picture of them.  He was like I couldn't turn that offer down.  ANyway Keith and I went all over the Bar looking for him.  I had to really use the rest room.  So I get in there and there are two girls in front of me..and there was one stall open because apparently it didn't flush.  Which was what I figured.  But fuck I needed to go. So i just went..and came back out.  Then I was like yeah it doesn't work.  I just relized I forgot to wash my hands...but apparently I didn't care.  Usually I do too.  Anyway, when I came back out we tried looking for Matt one last time.  I went by this guy who ended up grabbing my hand and kissing it.  I was like whoa.  Now Keith didn't see that cause He was infront of me..and I was holding his hand so I wouldn't get lost.  Then I was like ""I'm with him"".  Meaning I am just with him..not but like in a boyfriend way.  But when I said that he backed the fuck off. lol.  

We ended up leaving with out Matt.  So Keith and I took a taxi back.  Then I called Andy totally plastered.  When I was talking to him on the phone.  Matt tried calling me on the other line.  I couldn't deal with Matt so I just handed it to Keith.  ""I'm like deal with your brother.""  I guess matt hung out..cause he called again.  Then somehow I ended up on the floor..dragging myself.  Then all of a sudden Matt walked in and was like ""You guys abandoned me..and yatta yatta ya.""  Then Keith ended up going to bed.  So matt and I watched Will and Grace while I was talking to Andy on the phone.  Then I ended up needing to puke.  Not to mention Matt just put his trash barrel infront of.  So when I was puking Matt was holding my hair.  And then just sat next to making sure I was ok.  THen he ended up going to bed.  I was pretty upset..but I was on the phone with Andy still..then I feel asleep on the phone.  

When I woke up this morning my phone was on the table open.  Thats how I know.

Someone told me if you don't puke that means you didn't celebrate right.  Well I think I celebrated ""right"".  I deffinitly don't plan on drinking for a while.  I have only puked 3 times since I was 18.  And each time, I couldn't drink for months. So I am pretty sure that I am not going to get wasted on shannon's birthday. I don't think I can do it again for a while.

Well that was my week.  Happy 21 to me :p"

"event","Saturday was my cousins birthday.  So at about 7:30ish we were at my Aunt and Uncles house.  Michelle's tummy is getting bigger.  I felt the baby kick.  It was just AMAZING.  We had some cheesecake.  I also wrestled Kieth.  I put him in a head lock and brought him down hahah.  He is a riot.  Then Matt tried to take my legs while Kieth tried to take my arms so Jason could tickle me.  But they decided that because they were buzzed it probably wasn't a good idea. lol.

Then Sunday I met Andy at the airport at 1p.m.  After that we headed over @ the Holiday Inn Select.  Mom had a hard time finding the place.  Anyway we checked him in when we found it.  Then went to the resteraunt next door.  Mom paid. Mom never was introduced to Andy.  So she wanted to get to know him.  

After that.  Andy and I headed to the Coca~Cola factory.  It was ok.  We tasted some NASTY soda.  eww.  I thought I was going to hurl. lol.  Then we went to the Underground mall.  I bought some Candy.  I had an urge. 

Then later we went to the HardRock Cafe.  I got a salad, Veggie burger (which was AMAZING), and fries.  The only thing that was left on my plate was ketchup.  Andy say's I am an eating machine.

Then we went back to the hotel and just chill out.

We had to take the Shuttle to get to the Marta trian at the airport to get to atlanta.  It was interesting.  My first train expierence in ATL.  I think its better than the T.  Better directions.

The next day mom dropped me off.  About 12:30 we took the shuttle to the trian again.  This time we went to the Aquarium.  When we got off the train.  I wasn't sure if I was heading the right way.  I knew I wanted to eat lunch so I saw some Chinesse/Japenesse food place buffet.  I went in and asked them where the aquarium was.  They were like oh just head up that street.  I was like hey lets eat here.  So we did.  

After that then we went to the aquaurium.  I was wicked excited.  Cause I haven't been there yet.  It was AMAZING!  WAY BETTER than the Boston Aquiarium!  I think Andy took like 80pictures.  Cause it was a HUGE ASS aquarium.  I think he is in the process of getting rid of some of them though.  We were there for about 4hrs almost.  I touched some of the sea animals.  Like I felt the stingray.  So slimy. haha.  But I have actually held a stingray in the past when I went on vacation.  Andy didn't want to touch it.  He is like I like fish just not touching them.  lol.

After that we had to hop back on the Marta Train to head towards Buckhead.  Because they have the Cheesecake factory.  So we arrived in Buckhead and We stopped at the Lenex mall.  Then we took the shuttle to the Cheesecake factory.  It was awesome.  I love there food.

After all that we got back to the hotel and went swimming.  The water was FREEZING!! BRR.

My mom came and picked me up at 9:40.  So Andy walked me down.  We showed my mom the pics we took.  and just talked for a few minutes.

Andy is going to be coming back on Thursday March 30th.  He is going to arrive at like 10p.m.  He is going to help my mom move on Friday.  Cause we FINALLY move into our new house.  He is going to leave on April 3 at about 2p.m.  My mom is paying for half of his plan ticket because he is helping her move.  So woo hoo.  This time he can actually stay at my house.  Cause he would have no where to sleep in this apartment.

Anyway, I got home the other night.  Donny IM's me and told me to check out my myspace.  It was about a message he sent me.  I guess Kyra posted a bulliton about me and andy.  How she is pissed off.

See heres some background info.  Andy and Kyra went out about 7 months ago.  He broke up with her for another girl named Andrea. (because I guess he wasn't happy with the way the relationship was going).  Then he broke up with Andrea because basically she just was using him or playing games with him.  Sopossedly she says it was only in the beginning of the relationship.  Still thats wrong.  So then I started talking to him.  Because at the time.  Kyra gave me and shannon the impression she was cool with him.  She was like on the phone with him when I was there in January.  When I came back about a week later I decide that I would add him as a friend.  Then from then on we have been talking like just about everday for like hours on the phone.  Then our friendship and relationship just grew from there.  So now she is mad at me.  She ended out FOUR year friendship over Andy.  Not to mention Kyra HAS A BOYFRIEND of 6 months right now.  Who by the way she claims she is in love with.  So I don't get it.  If I was in Marc's position I would be pissed.  But I guess he isn't.  Not to mention Kyra is all like friends with the girl (Andrea) who Andy had left for.  LOL.  That is all fucked up.  Kyra like posted a blog about me..and only like Andrea, her cousin, and some other girl replied out of 134 friends of hers.  I just find it amusing.  At first I was kinda upset.  But now I just find it funny.  Cause its like soo stupid.  There all about that HighSchool Drama.  What could you really expect from 17yr olds?

Anyway, next week is my 21st birtday.  So I'll be writing in the journal again next week.  And keep ya'll posted."

"event","So I got up about almost at 3p.m.  Got dressed.  It was rainy out and kinda cold.  So I was contemplating on what to wear. haha.  I ended up wearing a sweatshirt, jeans, and BoSox hat.  I knew I was getting a hair cut so I just through it up, and it was curly.

Steph and I were kinda aruging over something stupid.  So she didn't come to the mall with me.  She would have been bored anyway.  So mom dropped me off about 4ish.

I was wicked nervous about getting my hair cut.  Only because up in Mass I have been going to JcPenny's Salon in Marlboro, MA since I was like 13.  I don't like the JC Penny's salon down here.  

I ended up going to REGIS and some russian lady cut my hair.  She did good.  You know how I have my underneath layer dyed blonde and you can only really tell when my hair is up.  Well my dark brown roots you can see them.  I was going to re-dye it but it was like 70.00  And I was like uhh I'll wait.  

After that I walked around the mall and went to some CD store.  I bought the Aqualung CD for Andy.  After that I called him and we talked for like 20 min as I walked around the mall.  After we hung up.  Steph called.  She wanted to go to the movies.  So while I was waiting for her I went to go get my eyebrows waxed.  

Then her and I went to the movies.  We saw Date Movie.  That was pretty funny.

So thats why I did that day."

"event","Well its been a while since I have updated.  To my faithful readers (haha thats if I have any).  Sorry. When you don't have much going on its just unessary.

Anyways, lets catch up shall we?  Lately I have just been working at the Holiday Inn Express.  About a week and a half ago my cousin Keith and I hung out.  He came and picked me up about 6p.m.  We went out to dinner.  We went to this place called the Mellow Mushroom.  I had a pizza with no cheese (I'll get into that later). with green peppers, and onions.  Then we were gonna go play pool and kill some time.  But they wouldn't let us play pool cause I was under 21.  Cause technically the place is a bar.  I was like thats retarded.  So we went back to his place and watched some t.v.  Then we went out about 9:30 cause we had tickets to a comedy club which was ok.  I had some laughs.  I could have gotten served alchol cause they didn't check Kieth's ID.  But I didn't feel like it (go figure).

So your probably wondering about the no cheese on the pizza deal.  Well about 3 weeks ago I had attempted going Vegan.  However, I'm not ready to quite give up on my dairy products.  However, I have been a Vegetarian for 3 weeks now.  I just felt like it.  I also discovered Soy Milk.  The brand is Silk.  The taste is delicious.  That is if you get chocolate, or mocha.  The vanilla is only good with cerel.  Your regular milk has pus!  I was like ew.  Thats another story.

Today, I have to go the Douglas Campus and fill in my Student renewel form thing.  Cause they wouldn't let me start when I came back from mass.  If you miss two days they drop you.  How retarded.

Good news is though I have a visitor coming to see me!!! My first one too!  It's Andy too (no not shan's bf).  Different one.  I actually only started talking to him like 3 weeks ago.  Cause I sent him a myspace request thing.  Of course I knew who he was.  He is my friends Ex.  I didn't know we were going to end up talking like everyday on the phone for hours.  He was soposse to becoming to Atlanta for a business trip.  However, they cancelled it till June.  So he just decided that he still wanted to come down.  So he booked his own flight.  I got him a discount at the Holiday Inn Select (which is near the airport) for $46.00 per night.  He is only coming for two nights.  I'm just gonna meet him there @ like 12.  My mom is dropping me off cause I'm still carless.  I don't want to pay for car insurance when I don't go anywhere and I'm trying to save to move out next year.  There is train that will take us right into Atlanta from the airport.  And the hotel has a shuttle to take us to and from the airport.  Which is good for him cause he can take the shuttle back to the airport for when he leaves.  Were gonna go to the Coca~Cola factory, the Aquarium, Bowling, movies, maybe a comedy, out to eat. Etc..Ect.  So he will be arriving in Atlanta Sunday March 5th, @ 1p.m.

My 21st birthday is the week after. Finally I turn 21.  I don't know what I am gonna do on my birthday.  My birthday is on a Monday.  I do know that Kieth and Matt are taking me out drinkin that week on Friday.  I'm sleeping over at their place.  I'm going to get so smashed.  Even though I know I shouldn't be drinking but whatever.

I am going to have to see the doctor in May.  Lets pray I have good news yo.

April 4th I should be starting classes.  March 20th I register.

A few hours ago I just booked my flight to Boston.  I leave the 7th of April.  Which is a Friday.  I will be there at 5p.m.  Shannon and her bro is picking me up I soposse. Shannon is turning the big 21 the next day.  I'm really glad that I will get to be there for that.  We MAY (not for sure) sleep over Stacy's.  I was soposse to get a flight back to mass for $99 and the mother fucking price went up in like 2 days.  Assholes.  It's like 268.00 round trip.  Last time I paid 323.00 round trip.  If you think about it considering the time I spent (12 days)its not that bad.  As opposed to stayin 4 days 268.00 round trip.  Andy is payin more to see me for like 2 days.  So I shouldn't complain.

I hope my other Bostonian/Rhode Islander friends come down to visit me sometime this year.  Cause it would be nice.  I'm planning on visiting everyone atleast one or two more times this year.  By the end of the year I will have spent $1,000-1,500 just on airflights alone.  Granted that is my choice.  I just hope that my close friends could atleast make one visit down here (in the summer).  I know nobody can't right now cause of school which is totally understandable.  I just get lonely down here thats all.  :( 

So I guess thats my rant for a while.  I am thinking about getting a hair cut (like add some layers and not cut off more than half an inch).  I also need to get my roots died.   Cause underneath my hair I have a layer thats blonde.  Not like blonde blonde though.  If you have seen me you know what I'm talking about.

Ok I'm done now."

"event","Well my friends it was a crazy 12 days.  It came and it went.  The things I expected to do...we didn't.  The things I didn't expect to do we did.  A couple of people I expected to hang out with I didn't.  THose that I didn't I did hang out with them.

Sunday night my plane was late. As I am heading down the escalater (however you spell it)...I saw shannon.  My eyes were full of surprise as I didn't expect to see her and her brother right there.  ONce I got down..I jumped on her and hugged her.  Like I never hugged her before.  My eyes started to water.  The next thing you know..I was crying.  I was crying because I missed my bestfriend, I missed my old life, I miss my home, and I miss everything I knew, I missed my friend, I even mass the cold new England weather.  I cried cause my life right at this moment is not the same.

After about 5 min.  We ended up getting my luggage. Then we had to find this place to pay for our ticket.  It was crazy.

On the way to Charlton.  Where Shannon lives.  We stopped at McDonalds.  I was Hungry.

Shannon, and I just bonded the whole night.

Monday we hung out.  Shannon's dad my awesome pasta.  It started to snow that night too.

Tuesday we ended up stuck inside the house cause of that snow storm.  Later that night though.  Shannon, and I went in her Hot Tub.  It was weird being in my bathing suit in the middle of winter.

Wednesday Shannon and I stopped at the Holiday Inn to see Kristene.  I couldn't believe how big Kristene had gotten.  She's pregnent so you know.  Kyra, also stopped by at the Holiday Inn along with her boyfriend Marc.

After that we had left.  We went to visit my Nana at the Nursing home.  It was sad.  I miss her.  She is doing ok.  Then after that we had stopped at my doctors in Milford.  They were such a big help to me before I had left.  So I dropped them off A christmas card.  Janet and my Dr.  were happy to see me.  

Later we went out to Olive Garden with Shannon's Friend Holly.  Holly is really friendly.  I always liked Shannon's friends.  There wasn't one I didn't like.

THursday was extremely awesome.  Later that night.  Kristene, Shannon, and I ate at Chillies.  I ran into Matt.  Matt used to work with Shannon, and I at Kohl's.  After we had ate.  I bought Kristene some baby stuff for my niece.  Then we just talked for a while at her house.  

Right after that we eneded up getting Kyra and Marc to follow us at the Woonsocket Bowling alley.  WE met up with Donny, and Stacy.  Stacy was the only one that didn't bowl.  I ran into Mike.  I also ran into MIKE T!!  I was so excited to see him!  He is so funny.  We all just had fun bowling and catching up.  It was such a blast!  I even did well at bowling.  Then surprisingly Rick, and Ashley came!  I was so surprised.  Apparently Shannon called them up to come hang out with us.  I saw the new car Rick bought ash.  As well as those diamond earings.  It felt like the old bowling crew was back.  It couldn't have been more exciting or happy.  After our bowling we went to Wendy's across the street.  It's our tradition.  The only people that didn't come was Kyra, and Marc.  They had to get up early.  

After we ate at Wendys I said goodbye to Ash, and Rick.  The rest of us headed to Stacy's appartment so we knew where was when we came back the next day.  Then later we left after a couple hours.  

Friday, Shannon and I headed over to Stacy's around 3. and arrived at 4.  Around 6 Stacy's friends Tim, and Cory come by.  After we talked for about an hour we headed over to Papa Gino's because I wanted bread sticks.  I don't have Papa Gino's in Georgia.  Donny, and his friend Blais had met up with us there.  

Blais didn't really interact with us to much.  He was basically on the phone.  Tim was really funny.  He was taken Shannon's digital camera and just taken pictures of Random things.  After Papa Gino's we went back over to Stacy's. Donny, and Blais though had went some where else. Stacy and I ended up starting to drink.  Shannon didn't because she was going to head home around 10 because she had to get up early the next moring to get her new Nissan Maxima ""96"" car.  So I was going to sleep over Stacy's by myself.

Stacy and I did plan to go clubbing but it turned out we got wasted instead.  After we had a few drinks Tim drove all of us to the Liquor store.  I had them get me a margarita, and a bottle of mudslide.  Then we went back drink some more.  Then Tim, and Cory had to leave for an hour or so. I was drunk and pretty bummed out.  So I was getting ready to go to the club.  Then Stacy was all like yeah there coming back don't go.  So I ended up staying.  Stef and Jess ended up leaving to the club.  I took a chance and stayed with Stacy.  I just didn't want to be drunk and up all by myself.  By then Shannon had left too.  So then I guess I hopped on the computer and started doing Drunk Iming.   Then all of a sudden the guys came back.  And well yeah anyway.  After about 30 min later they had left.  I was kinda mad. (remember I am still drunk).  So I got changed into my Pajamas. and we were laying on Stacy's bed.  Then all of a sudden Mike (Jessica's boyfriend) walked in.  THe first thing he said to me was ""Aren't you Jon's girlfriend""  I was like ""Thats EX to you.""  He apparently remembered me but I had no recollection of him.  I basically told Mike that he was taking Stacy and I too Coffee and Cream because I was hungry.  And he actually did.  Once we got there.  I ran into Jay.  A person I was surprised to see.  He was like ""hey how are you?""  I kinda looked at him like who the fuck are you?!  Because I didn't relized who it was till after a min.  As I am still wasted.  We talked for a min.  He ended up leaving and we got a table.  Then I made a couple drunk calls.  

After we had left we had stopped some where and Mike had invited Josh, and one of his other frineds to come hang out.  I was excited.  THe more people the better.  Basically we were all drunk till like 5a.m.

Saturday morning.  I woke up with a hangover.  I eneded up making stacy get up and get ready to go to Yolks.  Seeing how I haven't ate there in a while.  I wanted food.

Shannon ended up coming by at like 4p.m.

We went back to her house and ate some dinner.  Then we left at like 6ish.  We were then off To Amherst.  We had to make like 4 stops on the way.  Because we had a hard time finding Angie's appartment.  But we finally got there at like almost 10.  As soon as we got there.  I started drinking.  Surprisingly though nobody was really there.  All the guys were there Friday night.  I was disappointed at first.  I will not lie.  But once you get drunk everything gets fun.  Then people started to show up.  But there weren't drunk or weren't getting Drunk I was like you guys suck.  But Aaron's friends were really cool.  Surprisingly I remember there names.  Helena, Amy, and Ashley...I think that last name was right.  And some other guy named Jared. We all played a game that I drunkly couldn't comprehend.  I also was jumping on myspace and left that ""Drunk of the Drunk post"".  THen they were trying to hide my wine.  

Then all of a sudden Byn, and Frank came in.  Apparently as soon as Frank walked In I jumped on him.  And some how thought his name was Jake.  He said something about showing me his appartment.  So I went.  It was next door.  ANd I guess I was there for like 45 min.  But it didn't feel like it.  It felt like 15 because all we did was like make out..and yet I jumped on his computer getting random IM's it was so bizzarre.  Then I ended up leaving him.  When I got back everyone was in bed but Aaron, and Byn.  Byn made me a Gin-a-tonic.  Then not to much longer I ended up crashing.

Sunday morning I woke up.  With another hangover.  Later I hoped in Angie's shower and got ready.  All of us but Shannon, and Byn came to Stables.  Frank also went to.  I think he was surprised that I acted different sober in away.

After we ate.  We picked up Frank's car.  He asked if I would ride with him.  I said sure and we did.  However, when we left we got stuck in the snow.  So Angie, Mari, and Aaron had to come back and help us out of it.  We got the car out.

When we got back to the appartment Shannon was sick.  She was puking and the whole nine yards.  Spent the whole day in the bathroom.  We all felt bad.  I kept Shannon company for a while.  Frank sat in the bathroom with me for about 30 min.  He e even got shannon sprite.  Mari, and Angie had also kept her company.  Later though we all went to Chillis because Frank worked there.  After we had eaten we went back to the appartment.  Because we ended up staying another night.  I ended up getting drunk again.  I even played darts drunk.  we also watched a movie.  Mari's friend Fred showed up cause he was picking her up to bring her home.  While he was in the shower..Mari got my and her, and I think Angie to run into the bathroom in on him naked.  But its not like I looked or anything...

I was a tired drunk though that night.

Monday morning we ended up leaving.  As soon as we got back to Charlton shannon and I took a nap.  We woke up at 4:30 then got ready to go over to Anie's house.  Mari, Angie, and Andy and I had planned to go to the Fire and Ice.  I had never been there so they wanted to take me.  It was ok.  OUr waiter was hott.  Mari was like ""do you want his numeber.""  I said there was no point because I lived in Georgia.

Then we dropped off angie and them and said our final goodbyes.

Tuesday we went to Burger King with Shannon's boyfriend Andy.  Then did some random errands.  After that we had stopped to go and see Kyra.  Kyra made me talk to her friend Richard on the phone who was in Iraq.  I was like ook.  THen we all went and visitid Melinda and the kids.  THey have grown so much.

After that we had went to the movies to see King Kong.  Donny had met us there.

Then we dropped Kyra off.  I said my final goodbye to her.

After we had left Kyra's we all went over to Stacys.  Josh and His friend came again.  Josh wanted to see me again.  Go figure.  Donny had left by one.  The rest of us stayed till 3a..m  I said my final goodbyes to everyone.

Wednesday I was sick all day.  I was soposse to go to the Cheesecake Factory with Kristene..but that just couldn't happen.

Thursday Shannon and Andy had dropped me off at the Airport.  We got some pizza before I went to the security place.  

As I hugged shannon goodbye I didn't want to let go but I knew I had too.

I must have cried 4 times yesterday.  My friends are my life.  I had so much fun.

I was soposse to see Dan in NY but it was $200.00 round trip on train.  I didn't have that kind of money besides shannon got sick anyway.  I made out with 5 guys in a 3 day span.  I don't even kiss that many guys in one month.  It could have been 7 but I got wiped out.  I shouldn't have been drinking last weekend...but oh well.  I made some new friends.  I had a blast.

Until again my friends."

"event","Well tomorrow I call the doctor for the results.  I forgot to call them yesterday.

Holiday Inn has been going ok.  I got Christmas Eve and Christmas day off.  Monday I worked.  I work again this Friday.  I have New Years Eve off.  And of course I leave on New Years Day!!  

Christmas was fun.  We opened all our gifts.  I got some jewlery, and other stuff.  I don't really keep track.  Steph bought me Sour Patch, and Madonna.  Mom bought me my plane ticket, travel shampoo and conditioner, and a web cam.

Yesterday, I came over to see them at around 5.  My mom and sister went earlier.  I was too tired to go in the morning cause I was up all night.  I also didn't want to got to the Atlanta Aquarium.

Derek wants to hang out.  So that would be cool.

Not much is really happening.

I may get an MP3 player before I leave.  It would be much better than carrying a bunch of CD's around.  I would love to have that for when i travel this weekend."

"event","Well Holiday Inn is going pretty well.  I basically started doing things on my own on the third day.  I could work a shift alone now.  I met like everybody that works there.  There all in General nice.  I will be working the shifts alone so it doesn't really matter.  My manager Sam has been training me and supervising me.  He was like so how come you don't have any boyfriends blah blah.  I felt like saying why do you care you married.  But ah I didn't.  I talked to this guy named Rocky who is 26 and he is Hindu too.  So hes not goodlooking or anything.  Anyway, we were talking yesterday and he was telling me what it was like when he first came to America and how he went to a strip club or what not.  Before he left he was like your so cool I can't talk about this kind of stuff with anyone else.  I'm like sure.
I guess its because I am just generally a friendly person and I make people feel comfortable and people always seem to tell me things.  Even if its unappropiate.  I did want to tell him that I went to a strip club too.  But I wasn't going to cause its work...and hes a guy and may take that in the wrong way.

Today, I went to that Doctors appointment and they took 4 tubes of my blood.  I find out Tuesday/Wednesday my results.  She said I could be clear of it or not..or still in the process.  If I am chronic I have to see that Gastro Intestint specialist.  They would have to give me Anti Biotics. (However, the hell you spell that).  That would suck taking pills forever? For a while anyway.  I forgot to ask her about the field I was going into.  I'll ask her on the phone.

Christmas is right around the cornor.  I'm not really thinking about Christmas or New Years this year.  I guess because we don't have a tree up.  Cause were in a small appartment.  I haven't bought anyone gifts.  Including Mom, and Steph.  I am broke.  I told Steph I would be getting late Christmas gifts.  I feel wicked bad.  I love buying Christmas gifts for people. It's fun.  I think.  I'm also more focused on my upcoming trip to Mass.

I am just so excited.  I know I mention that in every journal entry and I tell you.  And you may read that on myspace.  I just hate it here in Georgia.  The only think I like is not shoviling.  I don't get to see my cousins as often as I would like.  Besides the holidays and little family get togethers.  I mean like me and one of my cousins just going out.  Keith and I have like attempted 3 times.  He did call me but my phone was out of service for a couple days.  I was so bummed out that I missed it when he told me this past sunday.

Speaking of this past Sunday.  I did go over to my Aunt and Uncles.  I saw Grams, and Papa.  They are just the sweetest people you'll ever meet.  There staying till Feburary.  I also get Christmas Eve and Christmas off.  So I'm excited.  Jason, and Michelle will be in Ohio.  There visiting Michelle's relatives.  Aunt Louise will be coming on Christmas Eve and leaving New Years day.  I wish Martin came.  I miss him.  I think I mentioned he is on House arrest now. So.

I have to call West Central Tech tomorrow.  I e-mailed my teachers saying I wouldn't be there the first 3 classes.  One of them e-mailed me back and said I have to talk to Student Services because after you miss the first two they mark you absent or some type of shit.  He said it was standard procedure.  Standard my ass.  What a fucking pain in the ass this is to take 2 fuckin classes.  Are you kidding me?! I am not waiting another semester to take these classes.  I will rip someones head off.  Fuckin people.

Anyway 10 more days till Boston!! <3 A week and a half yo."

"event","So earlier this week I went to the Orientation @ 1p.m. instead of 9a.m.  I went to the Murphy Campus.  It was way different for the CCRI orientation.  WCTC had loads of people.  They gave me this card thing and told me to sit at the color of my ballon which was Red.  And they basically went over the stuff you need to know.  Then they sent my group to this room.  In there that had it all broken down.  Radiologic Technology, Medical Assistant, Dental Hygene.  So I sat in the row of RT.  And I told them the 2 classes I needed.  Then I had to go to another room to get my schedule and then a different room to pay.  And then another room for Student I.D.  It was wierd.  I was just like woah.  

Also they said for the people that are going into the medical field we have to go to another Orientation on JANUARY 3RD.  Are you kidding me?!!  I was like why didn't anyone mention this in advanced.  Cause everyone found out that day.  So I told the lady who did my schedule that I'm going to be out of state.  And right now I'm not even taking any medical classes right now cause I have to take these mandatory classes.  I'm like is it possible to go in April. So she was like yeah.  But I don't think she even knew what she was talking about.  What assholes.

Anyway, that day after I left we went into this place called Crackerbarrel.  I just randomly asked for an application.  Then there was the Days Inn next door.  I was like what the hell I'll stop in there too.  The Front desk guy said they weren't looking but the Holiday Inn was which was next door.  So I go in there I ask if there hiring.  He was like have you worked Front Desk before.  I was like yeah.  And he was just asking questions and was like ok.  ""Can you come in @ 2 on Friday?""  ""Sure I said.""  and then yesterday he just decided to hire me. I was like sweet.  And the funny thing is, thats like the only second job that I have attempted here.

Buckle was only going to pay me $4.00 an hour and then whatever I sell would be commision.  I'm actually glad they didn't hire me because I have classes from 1:15 - 3:30p.m.  I told him I could work like after 2p.m. Mon-Fri.  I said that because I needed a job and I didn't know when classes were yet.  I didn't find out till this week.

The minium wage here is $4.75.  Oh hell no I'm not working for that little.  I get paid pretty decent considering its the south.

My manager is way better than my old manager at the Days Inn.  He's much more friendlier and he actually knows what he is doing.  I'll be working on Fridays, Saturday, Sunday at 2p.m.-10p.m. although My manager said he would try to get me a night off every so often.  He was like I understand its important.  So like him understanding that means alot to me.  Most managers don't care.  Also like one night a week I'll be working 4-10.  

I didn't think I would be working at a hotel again.  I actually really didn't want to.  But I mean atleast I get to do my homework at this place while its slow. I'm not getting out at 11.  I hate getting out at that time.  It's pretty easy running a hotel.  Also this hotel is small. It only has like 45 rooms.  My old hotel had like 72 or 79.  I also don't have to fold laundry at this hotel like I did at the other one.  So yeah I'm pretty happy to know when I come back I will also have a job.  He is letting me take the time off.  I mean I have plane tickets so you know.

Anyway, I'm off.  

14 more days!  So excited!"

"event","Well its 5a.m. I can't sleep.  Nobody is online.

I was reading in my little book thingy about Radiologic Technology.  Cause that is what I will get my associate degree in down here.  So you know I'm reading the requirements of like what classes I would have to complete before being elgible into the program.  They said after I complete the classes I would need these requirements to enter the program:

Current basic cardiac life support certification.

Copy of Immunization records including PPD and/or Chest X-ray results.

Copy of documentation of immunity to varicella (chicken pox).

Record of physical exam with a physician statement that the student is in satisfactory health.

Hepatitis screen results and documentation of immunity to rubella, measles and tetanus.

Verification of liability insurance (can be purchased through the college)

Do you know what this means?!  There may be a chance that I wont be able to become a doctor or work in the field of nursing, or even Radiology.  I'm afraid that there not going to except me because I have Hep.  IF there is a chance that I do have it for the rest of my life...which I do doubt I can really kiss my dreams goodbye because I would be endangering someones health.  I'm not sure about working with dead people though.  

There is also that possibility that even if I'm fine and I'm immune to it already that they still don't want me.  I mean I got that notice from the American Red Cross saying I can't donate blood recovered or not.

I guess I am going to have to ask the GC at the college and my doctor when I see her.  I mean I didn't really think of it at the time.  I just started crying because I can't believe that what I want to become may not be possible.

If I can't become a Forensic Pathalogist I may become depressed.  Because thats what I want to be.  Everyone else will be able to become whatever they want and not me.  And someone maybe like ""oh no big deal just go into something else""  If I ever hear that come out of someones mouth friend or not I will fucking knock you out.

Like I said I don't know for sure.  I have to find out.  But its nerve wracking. I'm afraid I am not going to get an answer I like.

I'll just have to keep you posted till I get a conformation on my answer.

I only blame myself for this mistake.  I should have known better.  I guess I should have a back up plan.  Maybe I will be a Physciatrist.  I can't spell that right now too tired to think.

I rather not talk about it with anyone it will make me more upset.  But I had to write about it cause I'm frustrated.  No one (well actually T who reads this does) but other than that no one knows what I'm going through.

Well I'm going to stop complaining.  I just need to talk to my doctor..and have a backup plan for my future.

It's amazing how a few min can totally alternate your life."

"event","Well last weekend I helped my mom out with the craft show thing.  We did ok.  Could have done better. It really wasn't that busy.  Usually from what I heard, they have lots of people but there was another craft show going on.  Sunday was the only day I didn't go with my mom.  Steph went.  I told Steph to pick a certain something up for Shan's parents.  It's just a little something for them having me stay over and all.  I have to send them a Christams card too.

Mom is put in an application today to get a cart at the mall.  There is some fee for every month.  However, this month there booked.  So I don't know.  That would be cool though to work at the mall and be in charge.  Another good way to meet people too.  Will see.  

Buckle hasn't called me back and I haven't really bothered.  If they really needed me anyway they would have called.  I'm sure with the busy time they already have the help.

Today, I picked up my watch at walmart.  I needed a new strap.  I got black.  I have worn my watch for like a year.  That was my only christmas present last year cause it was expensive.  She didn't think I would wear it.  She was crazy to think I wouldn't wear a watch that had diamonds in it.  It's the most expensive piece of Jewelery I own.  I'm going to show that shit off.

Also I went to BestBuy to check on my laptop.  They had to send it to Compaq.  Cause there people can't fix it.  Compaq may have to replace my computer.  Good thing I am under warrenty.  I miss my laptop.  

I want a webcam.

I got a letter in the mail from Wes Central Technical college.  My highschool transcript finally came in.  I have Orientation of December 13th.  I noticed there quarter starts January 4th.  ANd I was like Oh shit.  I would miss 7 days.  But that doesn't mean I am going to miss 7 days of classes.  When I dropped of some sheet earlier today.  I asked them how many times are you allowed to miss class.  Some guy was like you can just e-mail your teacher and ask them what you want them to do.  It shouldn't be a problem.  But becase I am starting on a delay.  I am only going to take 2 classes.  I don't want to come back and overwhelm myself or get behind.  Then I wont do good.  So its good once I get back I start.  Yay.  My quarter runs through Jan-April.  Then I am going to go full time April-July.  So I dont' think I am going to come up in June to mass.  If I want to get out of here.  I have to go to college.  The quicker I do it the faster I can permently move back up.

Also because I will be away I am going to miss Steph's 15th Birthday.  I kinda feel bad.  But atleast she isn't turning 16.  For every girl thats a big deal.

December 21st.  I have to get my liver checked again.  Fun Fun.  It's $90.00 to see the doctor who has too look up my thing in the book.  Southern people..

During that time my Aunt's parents are coming down. I am really excited to see them.  They are so nice.  There like oh you can call us Grammy, and Gramps.  They are the sweetest people.  There real names or Jennie, and Al.  Gramps has some type of cancer.  So he hasn't been doing well unfortunally.  There from Fitchburg, Ma.   My Aunt will be coming out from California.  Martin can't come cause he is still in prison.  I written him a letter a while ago.  Still haven't heard from him.  It's time like these though that I am happy to be in Georgia.

Somebody said..oh thats sucks that you'll be coming Jan 1.  I said why.  They said you can't celebrate it with your friends.  I said no I want to spend it with my family.  I wouldn't have it any other way.

January 1st I'm just so excited to be arriving in Boston.   I know I mentioned that like a million times.  But I just can't wait.

January 6th I'll most likely be in Woonsocket.  Stacy and Stef got an apartment.  They share it with there friend Jessica.  Were plan to hit the club in Providance.  I can't wait.  I miss the club.  Not that we don't have clubs down here.  But I haven't met anybody to go with.  And I am for sure not going alone to get hit on by scumbags.

January 7th - I'll be going to Umass Amhurst to see Angie.  She is having a party all weekend long.  She got an apartment for the semester.  Shan and I will be attending on Saturday.  Shannon is inviting her friend Mandi.  I can't wait to meet her.  This girl loves Law and Order SVU just like me.  As well as like to sleep.  I never met a friend of shannons that I didn't like.  I also invited Jay.  I told him though that he would have to drive up.  Cause shan does live far.  He said ok.  So will see.  He was like ""if you hook up with any other guy besides me I'll be mad.""  I was like ""don't worry about.""  The oly way I would hook up with another guy is if he wasn't there.  I'm not really soposse to get drunk.  But I mean It will be 5 months.  One night of drinking can't hurt... I hope.  I'm not going to be robbed of my fun.  I am probably not making a smart decsion but I'll just have to deal with the consequences.

Like I said we also plan to go to NYC shan, and I to see Dan.  Were going to sleep over at his dorm.  Were going to have so much fun.  I don't know what day were going.  I dont' know what else were going to do.  But I know Jen wants to hang out.  Donny too.  As well as others.  I can only spread my self so much hahah.

I'm just glad when I get back from my trip..I will finally start my life down here.  I have literally not done anything down here.  I mean I have been doing things but you know what I mean.  I will still be in the process when I get back but atleast it is progress.

Today I when I was at that Mall.  I thought about Shannon, Meg, Stacy, and Donny.  How we all went Christmas shopping last year.  I was looking at these two people who are friends or going out.  But I was like I wish I could be with my friends.

Well thats my busy 2 months.  Busier than these last 3 anyway."

"event","Well on the 16th of November I took my placement test.  I just have to wait for my highschool transcript to come in so I can pick my classes and fill in some sheet.  So I am going to stop over tomorrow to find out if the transcript came in yet..as well as hand in my sheet.

I finally got a hold of my doctor.  It took like forever.  So I made an appointment to see her on the 21st of December.  Then I will see a Gastro speacialist to see if my body has develped the anitbodi.  Which means I wont have this for the rest of my life.  Hopefully it will be gone before I turn 21.  I want to get mad drunk!

I called the Buckle store.  (Technically I was sopossed to call once I knew my class schedule but that wont be like for 3 weeks).  So I just called them and said I can't work before 2 mon-friday.  And then Mike said he would call me back this coming week about the ""hiring decsion making"".  I was like ook.  Cause before it sounded like he wanted to hire me.  I don't know.

Thanksgiving was good.  I found out that Michelle is having a baby.  So I'm really excited!  When Matt, and Keith later left.  We all played Phase 10.  It reminded me of when Donny, Shannon, and our other friends played it.  Mom was the only one that really didn't know how to play.  I came in 3rd place  My Uncle was first then my Aunt.

Then we all went back over the next day for left overs.  Turkey soup that is.  And we all pretty much talked. I played pool with Jason.

Yesterday, I officially purchased my airplane ticket.  I depart from Atlanta January 1, @ 4:14p.m. and arrive in Boston at 6:40p.m. Shannon, and Andy will be picking me up from Logan airport.  I'll be departing from Boston on January 12, and departing at 7:20 and arrive in Atlanta at 10:13p.m.  So I am soo excited.

"event","So bascially this week I did absoulutely nothing.  I just about sat on my ass literally. Watched AMC and anything that had to do with Ghosts, Haunted houses, etc the whole 9yrds.  So yeah.  I haven't been online.  Too lazy I guess.  I just haven't been in the mood to communicate with anyone.  Online or phone.

This past Friday though I did go to the boo run.  I did the 5k instead of the one mile.  I must have ran like 1/2 mile.  But I got extremely exhausted.  Because one I am still not well, and two I just haven't ran in a long time hence I am out of shape.  After that we had went out for Pizza.  The whole family came even Matt.  I was surprised.  However, he brought his stupid Farret.  Hype.  I was like what the hell..  He ended up leaving cause his little pet was cold.  Yeah thats my cousin.

Steph ran 3 miles in 38 min.  Uncle John came in at 32min.  Michelle is still technically the house champion for the 5K.  She can run the 5K in 25min.  Keith did start running with us.  (Although technically he isn't sopossed to be in the race because he had no number.)  Anyway he ended up going to the bar with out evenin finishing.  It was at the pizza place we all ended up eating at.  Which of course Michelle, and Jason were already there waiting for us.

Mom, and Aunt Ronnie walked the one mile.  They ran a little bit.  They came in in like 20 something minutes.

Michelle would like me to run in the peach tree run.  Which is a 10 mile run in Atlanta.  It's like a mini marathon.  I have to get in shape for that.  Thats like in July.

I am going to do the 5K again on Thanksgiving morning with Uncle John.

Saturday I went to my DMV class thing.  Which just reminds me I have to call that number now that I passed that course.  So my license wont get suspended.  Cause then I will have wasted six hours for nothing.  There was 2 guys from Mass.  One is orginally from Argintina.  The other one went to jail for 5 years for attemptive murder.  His name is Dance.  Literally too.  Dance was telling us he got pulled over on a suspended license already.  That he was drunk..smoking a blunt..and he had a gun that he put in his glove department.  Yeah I you should have seen our reactions when he told us that.  I was like ok...can I leave now.

Today, I went to Buckle for my second job interview.  Well Mike (who is like 21-23yrs old and very hott) gave me the job.  I just have to let him know when my classes will be in January.  Which I wont know until I take my assesment testing, and orientation.  So he told me to call him (which will be like in 3 weeks).  He said he would fit me in. He just wants to give me, and the other co-workers a set schedule. I don't mind waiting that long because of my health, and I am still getting stuff situated.

Steph dressed up as a slut for Halloween.  No lie.  It wasn't that bad though.  I did her make up..so she would look like a cheap slut.  I met a couple of her friends.  There nice.  Mom went out and did some errands.  So I passed out candy to the little shits.  I saw like 3 or 4 kids tonight not dressed up.  I was like what the fuck is this shit?!  Basterds!  Some kids looked cute.  I really don't like kids though.  

When Steph, and Mom came home.  We watched the Excocist.

I am all horror/scary movied out.  Like I don't need to see horror movies till next year."

"event","This morning we went to the Waffle House for some breakfast.  I got a waffle.  It was good.  There was these people sitting in this booth.  Like 1 baby, 2 toddlers, a grandmother, and of course the mother.  The grandmother you can tell is a cancer surviver.  The mother looked like she literally rolled out of bed.  You could tell her hair wasn't combed.  I mean I know you have 3 children lady..but how hard is it to take a brush and put it through your hair?  Basically she, and the grandmother looked like slobs.  Like its ridiculas.

After that we took an hour drive to the DMV.  Of course we got a little lost so it took a little longer.  We get there..and I can't get my license because I didn't have my birth certificate.  Now I didn't know this.  Also my mom had called, and even I had called no one ever answers the phone.  So how can I find these things out if no one picks up the fucking phone.  Mom got hers.  We came back home, and then went back so I could get my license which I did.  It was a pretty good picture of me.  Especailly for a license.

Then we came back..picked Steph up and then went over to Uncle John's and Aunt Ronnies for ""Mexican Night"".  Basically we had Margeritas..well not me of course cause I am sick.  So I can't drink.  So Steph, and I had virgin Margeritas.  We also had Tacos.  They were soo good.  Michelle, Jason, and Keith were also there.  I was so happy to see Michelle, and Jason.  Because I haven't seen them since I have been here. 

After we ate supper, we played trivia game.  Guys, against the girls.  The guys one.  Uncle John, and Jason were a little bit drunk.  Like Buzzed.  Jason kept pissing off Michelle.  I found it rather amusing.  Mom was a little tipsy..and sobered up before we left.  During one of the questions that Keith read he laughed so hard..his face went so red.  All of us laughed tonight so hard.  We all had fun.

About 9:30 Kieth left.  

Keith, and I made plans to see a movie this Saturday.

Then basically we all talked.  Jason, and Michelle left about 10:30.  We left about 11.

On the way home..we saw a baby deer cross the road.  That was pretty cool.

I was surprised Matt didn't come tonight.  You know I have no idea what is going on with him.  Keith doesn't know..cause they don't talk.  Pretty much there just strictly roomates.  I mean I called Matt yesterday..and left him a voice mail to call back.  I also called him last week and left him a voice mail.  I only called once each time.  Cause I know he is gonna get my voice mail.  I am a little pissed at him..only because he hasn't called back.  Like it takes 2 minutes ya know.  And its not like he is working on the weekends..and he doesn't have any friends really.  So I have no idea whats going on with him.

Well I saw the homeless cat yesterday..and that cat is a girl.  Which means she is pregnant.  You can see her tummy hangin.  That sucks..she homeless..and pregnant.  

This friday is the Boo run.  I am running 1 mile.  Mom, and Aunt Ronnie are walking the one mile.  Uncle John, and Steph are doing the 5K.  Michelle MIGHT do the 5K.  She isn't sure.  Jason is just gonna hang out.  Keith my run he isn't sure yet eithier.  I know Matt deffinitly isn't running..but I don't know if he is going to show up or not.  You have to sign up to run/walk in the race.  There is a fee of $20.00 but you get a shirt. It's at 8 o'clock the race.  After that will all be going out to dinner.

Also there is going to be an event all day in downtown on the night of the Boo Run.  So Mom, Steph, and I are going to do somethings during the day.

It's midnight..and I'm of course am exhausted."

"event","So Wednesday I went to the mall.  I ended up shopping like crazy.  I atleast bought $300+ worth of clothes.  Basically for the fall.  It's like a preppy style, yet kinda sexy, classy..very mixed.  Usually I wear sweatshirts, and t-shirts..and these clothes are different from what I normally wear.  I even bought high heels.  I went to this store ""Buckle"" and I asked for an application.  Which the manager gave me..who helped me with some of my shopping.  I woke up that morning at 8.  I fell asleep at 8'clock in the car..while waiting for mom.  Then went home and crashed.

Yesterday, I went back to ""Buckle"" to see Mike the manager.  I gave him my application, and resume.  He seemed impressed.  So he wants me to come back on Monday (Halloween) for another interview.  Cause I talked to him for like 10min when I handed him my application.  

Last night I went to bed at 8 and woke up at 4:30 this morning.

Martin wrote me back.  I got his letter yesterday.  He seems like he is doing ok..all considering his situation.  I wrote him a letter back.

Today, I went out to the Olive Garden with mom for lunch.  I have been to the olive garden so many times..with lots of different people.  Going to Olive Garden today..gave me some comfort to home.

I also went to the doctors today.  She drew some blood..to check my liver something..I can't spell it.  She is going to compare my blood from this month..to last months.  She is also going to set me up with a doctor who speacilizes in the intenstint field.  And set me up on some sort of plan..and what not.  Also they may put me on Steriods to give me Glycome (however that is spelled) put into my liver..to make me not so exhausted.  She was gonna put me on it today.  However, she wants to talk with the specalist.

You know this situation completely sucks.  This is not fair.  Why can't I be like everybody else..happy and healthy.  I feel like I am old cause I don't feel good.  I feel like shit everyday.  And I'm just so exhausted..and I don't even do anything.  Like I have no energy.  Most of you wouldn't understand exactly how tired I am.  Like who the fuck sleeps 25hrs straight.  Oh wait ME.  Like if I take steriods..am I gonna be like addictid..cause some people I think do.  It's actually a good thing that I am not starting school till January.  I just wonder if I am gonna be ok working ya know?  Like will I be even twice as exhausted?  Cause then I'll be actually doing something.

Tomorrow, I get my Georgia license.

I called Matt, and left him a voice mail.  I would like to see him tomorrow."

"event","First off I like to say that Kristene is having a baby girl!  So I am going to have a niece.  I forgot to mention that in my last entry.  But that news made my week last week.  I can't wait till I see my niece next summer.  

The other day I took a few pictures of me cause I was bored.  Plus I was sick of the pictures online on myspace.

I went to the BBQ also the other day.  Matt ended up not coming. He had to do somethings.  So therefore I still have no idea how Las Vegas went for him.  Maybe it went bad..and he knew we would ask.  So he didn't feel like going to see anyone yesterday?  Jason went traviling and one of the places was Columbus.  So Michelle flew out to Columbas to meet Jason there...so they could see friends, and family for the weekend.  They will be driving back together this Sunday.  I saw Keith, Uncle John, and Aunt Ronnie of course.  Then I watched the football game.  

Yesterday, I went to the Wes Central Technical School and filled in my application, and passed it in.  Apparently the dead line is November 4th..not when I would Start.  Therefore I start at like the end of Januaray. I have to choose out more Classes on before February 14th.  Cause classes will start in March.  It's wierd.  They do it by quarters.  I guess cause its a technical school.  So I'll be getting my associates degree in radiology.  Then transfer to a four year school.  They said if I have like all A's I wont have to wait to get into the Radiology program.  So lets say if I had to wait a year or something to get in..I could just transfer all my classes to a four year school but I wouldn't have an associate degree.  I rather have a degree when I transfer.  Plus I could get a decent job while in college.

I finally fell asleep this morning at 7a.m.  then I woke up at about 4..but kinda took a nap.  So 10 hours of sleep.  

We ate supper a little while ago.  I said something I guess really funny because Steph laughed so hard she puked up a little bit of her food...then kept on laughing.  She was like ""I have NEVER laughed so hard in my laugh.""  Her face was so red."

"event","Well the Wednesday I woke up at 5p.m.  I ended up staying up all night.  I didn't fall asleep till Thursday 1p.m.  Then I woke up at like 5 p.m. on that same day.  I ended up watching some t.v.  However, I fell asleep at like 10p.m. then I woke up at 3 or 4a.m. on Friday. Which was yesterday morning.  I was up for a while pretty much online.  Then I got tired again. So I fell asleep at 3 in the afternoon yesterday.  I woke up at like 6 to eat dinner.  So I was up for 15 minutes half asleep eating.  Then I went straight back to bed and didn't wake up till 5a.m. this morning.  So I slept for about 25hrs.  Can you believe that?

I am eithier tired because I am a little depressed.  So I could have forced myself to sleep 25hrs.  Or it could be the side effects of my disease.  I don't know.  I'll have to ask the doctor.

Yesterday, I talk to Dan on the phone.  I miss Dan.  He wanted my mailing adress because he would like to write me.  Which I thought was nice.

I hope to recieve a letter from Martin next week.

Last night when I was sleeping.  My mom, and my sister decide to use my laptop to watch DVD's. Cause we haven't set up our DVD player yet.  This morning I come out and find my laptop in the living.  So I pressed the power button to turn it on.  But it never came on.  I was like what the fuck?!!  Are you fucking kidding me?! I was so pissed off.  I tried for like 2 hrs.  I then decide to wake Stephanie at 7a.m.  I was like ""Did you shut off the computer last night?""  She goes ""No.""  I was like ""Why the hell not?""  I was pretty much yelling at Stephanie..and I ended up making her cry.  I was like ""Well you used my computer which almost costs $2000.00 yeah I am gonna be pissed!""  Like this was the first week that I started using my computer..cause it was hooked up to the internet.  I always wanted a laptop since I was in middle school.  So I was excited when I bought the laptop last year.  We just didn't have the internet, and I ended up having to drop out for the semester because of my car accident last year.  

Anyway, we brought it to Best Buy.  So I wont have a laptop for 10days. I am so bummed out.  Atleast it is under warrenty.  Cause I have a 3 year warrenty.  My laptop is like my kid.  I don't like people using my things.  That may be selfish but its the truth.  Especially when its expensive.  I hate it when people use my stuff, or they ask me, with out me offering.  I don't even like my family to use some of my stuff.

We went to the mall today.  I bought a kinda sexy top.  It's strapless, and has like lace.  It's sexy but not slutty.  I also bought a top that is like a half top with sleeves. Mom was trying to persuade me into buying a different top.  I was like ""Mom, I am 20yrs old.  I will wear what I want to wear wherever I want (as long as its an appropiate place to wear it of course).  It's not slutty mom.  Some times a girl needs something a little sexy.""  Thats pretty much what I said.  I also got a purse thats wicked cute.  It's siver, and it has little stars on it thats sparkily.  It was only like $40.00.  Its like the cheapest purse I own, besides my one $10.00 purse.  I have a fettish for purses...usually hundred dollar purses.  But I made and exception.

Some times, I am very materialistic.  I don't mean to be.  Some times I feel that I have to have the best of the best (of whatever I can affored).  But then like I am funny about certain things.  Like I wont buy clothes from Abercrombie & Fitch because I don't think my money is worth spending for me to walk around advertising them.  I don't like even walking in there.  I look at a pair of pants or shirt thats like $50.00 or more.  I am like fuck that.  But then I'll buy a $65.00 Dooney & Bourke wallet.  One day I'll buy a $7.00 necklace that looks pretty nice from Kohl's.  Then in a few months I'll buy a $100.00 necklace from Kay Jewlers.  I use to wear a $50.00 watch but then last Decemeber I bought a $400.00 watch.  Which I still wear.  Obviously I would be retarded not to after I spent that money.  My mom rags on me because I spend $200.00 on make up.  I just don't believe in pharmacy make up.  It doesn't last long.  As where expensive make up last longer..and its a better quality on your face.

Stephanie wore this pretty funky hat.  Steph was like ""So where did you get this hat?""  I go ""Walmart it was 5 bucks.""  Steph dropped open her mouth.  She surprised.  Cause I don't buy clothes at walmart. I will only get my film developed there..or I'll buy candy, Cds, or any food but never clothes.

I don't know.  I must be concided, or something.  Like some days I like the cheap things in life. The majority of the time its expensive things in life.  I mean maybe if I was in the situation where I had a family it would be different ya know? Cause then you can't just spend money where you like to or on whatever you want.  I mean maybe I am materialistic..because I am filling a void?  Or maybe I feel like I should take advantage of it while I have the opportunity to?  Cause you never know what life throws your way.  I do know that I never think I am better than someone because they may have less than me.  Not to mention some one is going to always have more than somebody.  Which obviously there are people that do have more than me. I know where I came from..and I know at one point in my life our family couldn't afford anything.  So I'm never a snob, or look down on anyone.  Thats probably why I get along with all different types of people..and I am very diversed person.  Cause ALL my friends are different.

Tomorrow I am going over to Aunt Ronnie's and Uncle John's.  There having a BBQ.  So I will see Michelle, Jason, Matt, and Keith!  Yay!

Mom is also buying another computer today.  Not a laptop of course.  A computer for her business.  Her future business anyway.

Oh yeah, Kyra has another boyfriend.  That girl goes through boyfriends like no tomorrow.  It's like every time she breaks up with a boyfriend thats shes been with for a few months. A month after they break up..she has another boyfriend before you know.  How she finds them I have no fuckin idea.  This kid Marc goes to college in Boston, and lives in a dorm.  Hey you know what though good for her!  As long as my girl is happy.

Also on other news Rick bought Ashlee a pair of Diamnond Earings for there one year anniversity!  It's about time that kid gets her something nice.  He never buys anything for her ""just because"" you know.  Like flowers.  They don't really go on dates eithier.  There always haning out with Paul, and Heather on the weekends, and working.  So for her sake I hope them diamonds are big. haha."

"event","A few nights ago.  I saw this black 12 yr old or maybe 11 totally preaching till he was gonna pass out.  he was like ""OH LORD LET US HEER OUR PRAYERS"" amoung a whole bunch of other things I couldn't understand.  I found it to be amusing.

All there is, is Baptist people down here.  We only have 1 catholic church.  While there is like 12 Baptist churches.

I downloaded Yahoo.messanger last night.  Because that is what Martin has.  So I saw somebody online I haven't talked to since I was 15 or 16.  So I talked him for like 3 hrs.  I remembered his name too surprisingly!  

Well thats all. Nothing great.

Oh yeah, and shannon is writting a story and using my name in it.  Basically telling me how to keep a steady job, reletionship, and all other things.  I am like yeah.  If someone could only teach me that in real life."

"event","After I finally fell asleep at 6a.m. yesterday morning.  I had to wake up for 8:15a.m.  I had to get ready for my doctors appointment at 9.  The office was really hard to find.  So we finally found the place at like 9:30.  Mom even printed directions on how to get there.  Apparently they weren't that great.  

I got there.  I filled out paper work. I think they finally saw me at like 10:00.  The doctor finally comes in to see me at 10:30.  We discussed on what I had.  What the doctor in Mass wanted me to get done.  Cause the doctor up there said I should have my blood checked every two weeks.  She goes I don't think you need it checked that often.  All of sudden she whoops out a book and looks up the disease and trys to find out how often my blood really should be taken.  I don't know I never seen a doctor in my life get out a book. I was like wow.  I explained that I called for the medical records to be mailed to you.  She was like ""Ok"".  She then asked what my doctors number was so she could call him and speak with him.  She called him but the office was closed yesterday cause of Columbus day.  (Everything is open on Columbus day even school).  So she didn't charge me for my visit yesterday.  Thank god.  Tomorrow I have to call her and reschedule my appointment.

After that we stopped a city hall to find out about the permit of our house.  I think mom is gonna back out of the deal.  Now were going to have to look for a new house.

It was about 11:30 after we had left.  We stopped at Taco Bell cause I was hungry, and wanted a taco.

We came home.  I layed down with the dog on the floor for about 10 min.  Then I decided I wanted a nap.  Which I took till like 5:30p.m.  Then we ate supper.

After like 30 min mom wanted me to go look at some houses with her.  I didn't really want to go but I was like ahh what the hell.

We have a dumpster that you can go to on the way out of leaving the apartments.  And I threw a couple bags like Stop, and shop plastic bags.  Well I think I hit a cat cause it meowed.  I felt so bad.  I have seen the cat around the area.  The cat is skinny.  A couple days ago it was sleeping by the dumpster.  I would take the cat in and like bring it to the vets.  However, I already have a dog.  I don't think that cat belongs to anyone there is no collar around the cat.  I just feel so bad for the kitty.

That was like my ""eventful"" day.  I think I am going to give Matt a call later.  He's back from Las Vegas, and I want details!"

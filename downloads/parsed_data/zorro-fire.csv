"event","i am leaving for tour in about two hours. finally. i don't really know where all we're going and i don't really care. bri made me a giant bag full of candy, powerade, and cookies.

dave and i had lunch at the heorot and i am about to get another pint. and pack, i suppose. zack broke my nice Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale glass wednesday night. i have all the songs down perfectly and have fun with it. the batman cape and bicycle sunglasses are coming with me on tour. and the Mr. Weenie shorts my dad got for me.

what is left to do this summer? record the osteoferocious full length (which will be put out on Flannelgraph Records), go to lake michigan, and build another bike."

highlights of the end include visiting bloomington, buying the David Bazan &quot;American Flags&quot; 7&quot; and &quot;Elephant Eyelash&quot; on vinyl.

Cairo decided to be nice and curled up on me as i used automatic shotguns to escape from captivity, located natalya, and escape through the library windows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; it was late by then, and i decided to use the $5 bill in my pocket wisely (the pizza was in my freezer already):<br /><br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 508px; height: 381px;"" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00103.jpg"" /><br /><br />now i am going to finish watching Fight Club and snooze. it was a good day.<br /><br /><img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00050.jpg"" style=""width: 408px; height: 543px;"" alt="""" />.</lj-cut> <br />"

Ronald Jenkees was watched that night and Double Dash was played. but i went straight to bed. seepy. we woke up to bagels, waffles, coffee, and Mario Party 8. and we practiced for 'i trusted you' by andy kaufman (youtubes it). before the show we played four-square, obviously.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00215.jpg"" /><br /><br />dave had the ultimate four-square blooper (a fooper, if you will) when he stepped on the ball, slipped, and came crashing down onto his back. this particular session was also very tense. i hit dave in the head with the ball and he chased be around the entire building. stephen and zack got pretty competitive. it was good though. four-square kept us active the entire week. here we have a picture of me singing and everyone else doing their thing for our cover. keaton and stephen's faces say it all.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/n705035601_3022292_5042.jpg"" /><br /><br />i think it went well. after the show we had a massive pizza party in david's basement. al green played the entire time. dutch blitz, uno, and mario kart were all played also. it was a blast. here is a good example of just how many people were there:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00220.jpg"" /><br /><br />cool your jets just kinda hung out in the corner. but oh well. i talked with nate hendricks for a little while (buy his cd) about trade school in north carolina. nice. we woke up early the next morning for chicago. we had to get up because david had work, so we decided to go eat at Bob Evans. stephen flaked out on us with some of his friends the night before, and when he met us for breakfast he was $100 richer. we played four-square in the Target parking lot with our shirts off. some girls drove by and called us fags. BLOOPER. we made it into chicago on a very nice and sunny day. i like chicago on such days. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00227.jpg"" /><br /><br />we were all pretty tired, so we began napping at sabrina's. when kyle sleeps, his eyes are usually halfway open. and you can see his left eye slowly wandering around. it is unbelievable. funniest thing ever.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00229.jpg"" /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""13""/><br /><br /><br /></lj-embed><br />we played out on the porch, which was kind of weird, but all the while a good time. uncle andrew and the melkins played, and we had met andrew last year at sabrina's. the cops showed up eventually, so many people left. a handful of us hung out in the living room and told ghost stories and riddles. keaton and i slept out on the porch that night. it was cold at first, but i awoke to the sun shining on my face in a cloudless sky.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00236.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00241.jpg"" /><br /><br />this cat loved boxes. i wanted it to come home with us.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00239.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00232.jpg"" /><br /><br />we left chicago and made it to lansing. it was an awkward time. nice people and grill (i cooked a couple bratwursts), but awkward. pixie nixie and brixie showed up. we played in a basement. laura sold a boatload of things, and a shitty rage against the machine-esque band played after us.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00242.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00244.jpg"" /><br /><br /><lj-embed id=""14""/><br /><br /><br />we stayed at kyle's parent's in angola that night. tons of food and drinks. we made his sister make us popcorn. zack and i watched football follies and family guy. it was a lot of fun and a needed rest. we left fairly early so that we could see Indiana Jones at the marion theaters. it was ok. i think it could've been better. but oh well. then we went to breezey's high school graduation. i am sure that we embarassed zack's mom. the show at the Red Barn was ok. my friends were there and it was good to see them. this is about all the people there when we first showed up.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00252.jpg"" /><br /><br />more trickled in. then we drove to indy the next day. our van kept dying on us whenever we stopped, and we'd have to restart it in neutral. well, stephen had to. he was the driving champ! like none other. we were only half a block away from kyle's when it happened, so stephen and kyle totally pushed the van into the parking lot. this isn't so much a good picture, but at least you know the story.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00264.jpg"" /><br /><br />we played in an ex-church. it's like an arts center now. cool. we played four-square and hung out. i found these pics on my camera, apparently taken by kyle. alex filled in for keaton.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00267.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00268.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00273.jpg"" /><br /><br />and so tour concluded. it's nice being home, but i would love to be back in the Hot Van, chillin' and playing. there is nothing like it. touring is quite an experience.<br /><br />i would like to thank everyone that helped us out, gave us food, put us up, and showed us a good time. namely, joel, justin &amp; helen, melissa, the hersh fam, scott, sabrina, ellen, mark, kyle's parents, kyle's sister, stephen and lucas, airbud, and the PEORIA CREW. thank you. and thank you to those i forgot. i'm sorry. i love you.<br /><br />a three week tour is in the works for july. rodeo ruby love vs. the South.<br /><br />oh! on the way home from indy stephen, zack, dave, and myself had a little sing along:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""15""/><br /><br /></div>"

"event","this is very long and overdue. so let's begin!<br /><br />this was to be my 'apartment' (as stephen called it) for the tour.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00194.jpg"" />&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""...!"">We woke up at about 4 am saturday to embark on our journey to philadelphia. needless to say, we weren't quite looking our best. or maybe we were?<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00146.jpg"" /><br /><br />anyways, we got to philly, after traveling through about three mountains. this is laura's friend's, matt, house. keaton on the porch.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00149.jpg"" /><br /><br />we were in the west philly area. there are still trollies in philly! crazy. this is where we played. very cramped indeed.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00150.jpg"" /><br /><br />we drove to bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus and home of Joel Williams, the famous cameraman for 69 News. gears of war and dutch blitz were played. hot dogs and spaghetti was eaten. we found this horse outside of the gas station we stopped at:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00153.jpg"" /><br /><br />i tried to jump on top of it, but it was made of plastic and hardly bolted in. so we made our way to new york, and while passing through New Jersey we listened to Saves the Day (naturally) and i took a picture of a smog cloud:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00155.jpg"" /><br /><br />dave and annie were with joel in his car, leaving me, keaton, laura, zack, and tour MVP Stephen ""Boyd the Droid"" (who was driving) in Hot Van. New York traffic is unreal. we took a wrong turn out of the Holland Tunnel, as a result of the tomtom losing signal, which put us in the middle of Manhattan with a trailer. crazy! zack nearly passed out from anxiety as the rest of us screamed and helped stephen drive. the dude is a champ. here is a photo of NYC:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00158.jpg"" /><br /><br />and a huge ass cemetery:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00161.jpg"" /><br /><br />we played in Brooklyn at Spike Hill. it was a cool bar, and i got a good Brooklyn Lager with one of the drink tickets they provided us. it was a neat stage with a cool drumset:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00162.jpg"" /><br /><br />we stayed with Justin and Helen (who became my favorite two people of tour) at their apartment. this is their back porch area that they share with some of the other people (yes, that is a jelly fish and santa claus):<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00165.jpg"" /><br /><br />there was also a big plot of grass in a sandbox-type thing. here we have dave enjoying the weather:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00168.jpg"" /><br /><br />we went sneaking underneath a building at Pratt. i think it was a boiler room. i just have to put this picture up:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00170.jpg"" /><br /><br />another shot:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00171.jpg"" /><br /><br />we heard a bunch of footsteps and clanging in a room next door, and fearing the worst, we bolted out of there. after returning, we hung out, ate ramen, made Welcome Home shirts, and played N64. i beat zack in baseball 18-2. here is stephen and zack playing mario party:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00173.jpg"" /><br /><br />our next show was only a couple minutes away, at Goodbye Blue Monday. it was like a bookstore/antique/treasure chest. i found a lot of cool books but did not swipe them. one book was authored by a man named Dick Hyman. get it?<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00175.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00177.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00179.jpg"" /><br /><br />then we drove to Montclair, NJ where we stayed at Helen's mom's apartment. the town was dead by the time we rode in. i could've laid down on the main street for awhile before any cars came. we woke up and decided to enjoy the day. keaton started jumping over some big boulders in the park, which resulted in zack getting the idea to jump over people. zack appears to be stepping on helen's head.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00185.jpg"" /><br /><br />then we got the idea to have someone jump from back-to-front, for band pictures. me and stephen did it, with cool poses. then annie decided to try it too, and ended up kicking laura in the head. i don't have the picture of it, but soon enough you will see it. the timing is perfect. here is keaton and melissa's dog. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00189.jpg"" /><br /><br />i tried to make the moves on melissa. but i don't think it quite worked. i didn't really have much chance to it seemed. we played in a basement and it was actually a lot of fun to play. this is our setup:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00191.jpg"" /><br /><br />afterwards we all went to this place called the Wastelands, which is this big cliff that overlooks a couple NJ cities and New York way off in the distance. it was unbelievable. i will try to snag some of the pics from keaton. it was at night, of course, and it's just a total explosion of the senses. a so-called ""Pride Rock"" is there, and i peed off the edge of it. the next day we played kickball (i made a super awesome diving catch that tore my jeans) and c.h.u.d. melissa made us all smoothies and burnt popcorn and spaghetti. stephen and i experienced the most awkward situation of tour, which involved the movie 'thumbsucker' and melissa's mom. then we drove up to connecticut and played in a bar, with the Mike Coffey Trio.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00192.jpg"" /><br /><br />we stayed at Airbud's house, which is in the total backwoods, and in the same neighborhood as Keith Richard's! i really wanted to see it, but everyone was tired and Airbud was super high. but he was nice and gave us more food than we could handle. after waking up we journeyed back to bethlehem and hung out about town till Joel got off work. there was a nice creek/river where people were fishing (and wished i was one of them):<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00198.jpg"" /><br /><br />it is a real old and historical town. good sightseeing. we drove to dover, OH the next day and went to the library there. the computers were still on Windows 98.&nbsp; were greeted with a potluck dinner.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00200.jpg"" /><br /><br />we also played some intense four-square. we stayed at the the hersh house that night. louisville was a very good show, with the most people we had seen so far on tour. chemic was great. and kyle returned to play with us. and i finished <i>Invisible Man</i>! so it was good. here is chemic:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00203.jpg"" /><br /><br />we then drove up to the marion area before pierceton. around the fairmount exit on I-69 the Hot Van began to leak something. so we ended up having to switch vans. this will be the closer for the first week of tour:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y138/zorro_fire/DSC00213.jpg"" /><br /><br />the shows haven't been so great. at least the not in the east coast. but now we are in the midwest, and tonight is peoria. this will be good.<br /></div>"

luckily everything was pretty much all moved out. my room fared the best. most of the damage (as you will see) is the room where my dad kept all of his guns/ammo.

my dad was getting some final stuff out, then left to go to Pastor Tim's house, which is like five minutes away. he was on his way back when one of the neighbors called and said the house was on fire.

my brother dave called me (he is a volunteer fireman out of sweetser) and said ""fuck man, i don't know how else to tell you...the house is on fire.""

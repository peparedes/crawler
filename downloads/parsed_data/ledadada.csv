I really like when the group suddenly synchronizes (1:54, 2:25-2:40, 3:15-3:30)
I kind of wish she would shape up and reperform this in her concert and shut everyone the hell up.

I went back to look at the actual performance, and it wasn't as bad as I remembered it. Closer to planned than I gave her credit for, but still sub standard."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Wed: First Day at Macy's""> Wednesday : Started my first day at Macy's. 6am baby. I haven't driven to work/school in the dark in a looooong time.  I do merchandising, which is basically moving fixtures and clothes around and putting out new stuff. Boring but i work with two cool people so it's not that bad. And the store doesn't open until 10 so i don't have to deal with customers for 1/2 of my shift. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Thurs: Anatomy study issues"">Thurs: Took my anatomy test that was supposed to happen on Tuesday. My professor came in and literally said, ""I forgot about the test. We'll take it on Thursday."" Seriously!?  So we took it on Tuesday. The test was pretty fair, although he tends to repeat questions more than twice. So if you miss it once, you're likely to miss it several times, unless you guess differently each time. Anywho, one of the repeated questions was something he mentioned in passing during the lectures that wasn't specifically typed out in his notes that he gives out. And everyone in the hall afterwards had their panties in a wad saying it was completely unfair b/c he said his tests would come from the lecture notes, which is why they don't always come to class. I just thought they were a bunch of crybabies. And I feel almost snobbish for thinking it, but if this had happened at UT, a professor would probably laugh in your face. It's not some obscure sentence from the text (which he doesn't make us read), it was something he said in class. Sure he only said it once and pointed at a picture instead of typing it out, but doesn't that make it fair game? Maybe I would feel different if I had gotten the question wrong, but I didn't so I don't.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Fri: 10.5 Hours at the Mall"">Friday: 6 am at Macy's. We started putting out toys for Christmas. They put up the Christmas trees 2 weeks ago. Ah, retail. My sister calls me at 9:30 to say that Dad's taken her car and she has work at 10. Just the kind of crazy I should expect. In my family, my dad and sister are the two impulsives and my mom and I are the overthinkers. Anywho, she gets a ride to work and my mom asks me to take her home since we both get off at 2 (we work at the same mall). Later Marylea calls me to say it's actually 3, so I agree to wait around for her since I probably won't get finished until 2:30. So I show up at Abercrombie at 2:30 and she says it's actually 4, but keeps me talking until 3, so it's not really enough time for me to go home. So I wander around the mall until 3:50. Come back, try on some clothes, and at 4 she says her manager won't let her leave until her replacement shows up. Sucks, but as an ex-manager I know this to be true. But at 4:20 I'm like WTH? they can't keep you here forever, go tell your manager you're leaving. But her manager is in a meeting and the other one is at lunch.  Perfection. So we didn't leave until after 4:30 and didn't get home until almost 5. Although none of it was intentional and was just the accumulation of small factors, I couldn't help being pissy. Especially since I had to cancel dinner plans b/c I was so tired and hadn't eaten b/c I kept thinking I was going home.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sat: Catching up with old friends"">Saturday: had lunch with a friend who just got back from Italy. That plus the pictures my cousin keeps posting from her study abroad in France, I'm really feeling urges for Europe. Ran a couple of errands before going to a housewarming. Seeing everyone was nice but just a little wierd b/c I don't seem to be chaning at the same rate they are. Not that it's a contest, but it's just wierd when people I graduated with have children or houses and I'm still in school.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sun: Lunch"">Sunday: Had lunch with the Friday cancelee (Ray from Port A), but he wasn't hungry so I pretty much stuffed myself while he watched. If he hadn't been a good friend, I would've felt embarrassed. But really, who eats a bag of chips before going out to lunch?  But it was good seeing him, except that he got me all worried about my complete lack of studying for the GRE, which was the next day. So I came home and did the two practice tests on the disc they sent me in the mail. I did as well as I expected, and I only need 1000 for the UT program,so that helped ease me.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Mon: The GRE"">Monday: Only did my morning shift at Seton b/c I'd scheduled the GRE at 3. The essay topics were easier than the practice ones-a little more science oriented, which made me feel good even though UT nursing doesn't count the essay score. But the verbal and math parts were 2x as long as the practice ones. Just when I thought I was finished, up popped another section. And another. It was crazy! But I'm very happy with my score (1390), slightly higher than the two practice ones. Came home, had some coffee b/c I had a slight stress headache from all the thinking and nothing fixes me better than a little caffeine boost. For dinner it was homemade tostadas. Yummy, or so I thought...</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Tues: The Mystery Sickness"">Tuesday, ""The Mystery Sickness""
 I had gone to bed feeling sick and had restless sleeping until about 3, where I moved to the bathroom. After laying on the tile for about an hour, it all came up. Spent the rest of the day laying around the house, completely spent and completely incommunicado. Didn't answer the phone or even look at the computer, which is something I usually do even when feeling sick, but I was having trouble sitting up for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I couldn't believe how bad I felt. I'm not sure what it was b/c the 24 hour, complete body achiness sounds like food poisoning but everyone had the same dinner.  The only difference was the coffee, which was the same bag and pot I've always used, so I don't know what happened. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text="" Wed: Recovery"">Wed:  I had let Macy's know I wasn't coming Tuesday night. Woke up feeling alot better but still sore and iffy in the torso. But after some tea and Cheerios am perking up enough to be coherently typing without effort. The rest of the day should see me getting back to normal.  Sorry if this is TMI but I'm still too tired to worry and type two entries, so hopefully your filter is working you'll forget.</lj-cut>

Hope everyone is feeling better than me!"

"event","This weekend was kind of a bust. Friday I think I spent shlepping around the house. Saturday I had the house to myself so I cleaned and danced around alot. Saturday night I went to a LAME-O party and cut out early (1-ish) to opt for Taco C nachos and Jawbreaker. Sunday, I tried to study for my Anatomy test but only got thru about half the material.

Monday was more packed. Seton, $320, and I went infront of city council. For more try...

<lj-cut text=""Seton speak"">

Monday though. Got to run the desk at Pre-op again, but was semi-bored and got a teensy bit of studying done there. In post-op, nurses are still being bias and just as boring as last time, but the patients were nice.  This one cancer patient said my bedside manner was really great, so that made me feel good. But then she asked if I had graduated, and after answering her that I had a bachelor's, realized she was referring to high school.  She was so shocked she repeated it 5 minutes later when her driver showed up (""Guess what?! She's graduated from college!"")  So that was sort of downing b/c I'm getting a better picture of how I'm viewed by others, but still felt good about how I was doing things.

Afterwards, I studied in the dining hall for about an hour to kill time for a meeting.  And I found a message on my phone from my doctor's office. I had complained about a bill, and turns out the insurance company fouled up and I get $320 back! </lj-cut>

 <lj-cut text=""This is were it get's interesting"">
The meeting was actually a hearing at Town Hall/ City Council. A few of you may remember that across from my house is a curved bluff, with a great view. Recently it had been sold to a developer who's trying to put 9 houses on it (there's room for maybe 5). He keeps going to the council to ask for variances on city ordinances so he can negotiate houses onto the bluff side. The neighborhood has been fairly stirred up at this b/c he's building 3 story houses, really close to each other, so that eventually it will look like a small apartment complex. 

So a few of the neighbors, including an ex-contractor who had tried to buy and build on the lot but decided against it, got together to go down and protest his application. You may have seen it on Austin's channel 6, looks completely boring and like they don't really know what's going on--and it's like that in person too. I sat and studied during the other cases.  But when it was our turn, it was pretty interesting. It's bascially debate style, where first he makes his case for the variance, then we get up and say our defense, he gets a 2 minute rebuttal and then the council ask questions to clarify. Then they make a statement (like in the supreme court) and vote. Here's how it went down.

Blackstone (the developer, nice name!) says he needs this tiny variance b/c he has a topographical hardship--he can't build stable houses on the incline unless he moves them closer to the curb at the top of the incline so the bases are more level. (there's a city ordinance requiring houses be 25 feet from the curb)

In our turn, we said that although we like our view, we have accepted that someone would develop it at some point and that's not what we were there for. However, his plans do not fit into or flow with the neighborhood, decreases the value of adjacent properties, and creates further traffic and environmental problems for the neighborhood b/c his housings will sit on drainage area to the creak below --hence the drop off. Specific to this variance, his ""hardship"" is self-inflicted b/c everyone who's ever seen the land knows you can't build 9 houses on a 60 degree incline.  Then my dad piped in that this is his 3rd trip, that we know of, to ask for variances, and that if this is granted he will back for another.

Blackstone rebutted that his land is it's own ""Subdivision""--which he got a variance to do w/o informing the community-so he doesn't have to follow the flow of our neighborhood (meaning his houses don't have to look like the rest) b/c ours are old (25 years--shocking!) and ""no one even makes houses like that anymore.""  

The council then proposed a compromise, allowing variances for two of the 5 houses that need to be up higher. Blackstone turned it down. Another councilman offered the point that by building the houses lower on the incline, the homes would be spread farther apart--offering more view and more desirable spacing between homes for a ""subdivision."" Blackstone responded that this was not his intent and that his ""staggered"" houses on the bluff actually leave a better view for the rest of us b/c we could see between the houses, but that if he has to change his plans he will turn the houses 90 degrees so they run along the incline thus blocking more view--and that his original plans were to benefit us. Right.

There was more discussion and a council woman read her statement, which was in favor of the variance. Then they voted. B/c opposition does not get a rebuttal we only need 2 dissents of the 8 councilpersons. We got three!  It was pretty surprising b/c everyone on our side thought we'd already lost based on the reading. The contractor and his little girlfriend were miffed. haha. Part of me feels this is somewhat wrong and vengeful but the guy turned out to be as big a dick as he was in my mind. And if he's going to ruin my view anyway, why not make him work a little harder and spend a little more?</ljl-cut>
<lj-cut text=""And now the bad news"">
Then I came home and studied/watched the Yankees lose--which was torture b/c right after you'd think the score difference was too much, they'd score and cut the deficit, so they actually still had a chance.  So I am much sad, in mourning in fact b/c supposedly the owner Steinbrenner says my own, most fans, and player favorite manager, Joe Torre would be fired if he didn't win. Maybe Joe should retire, but George has no class when it comes to these things--something that sets the Yankee dynasty apart from other franchises. Anywho, we'll see what happens next season.</lj-cut>

Smaller news: I weighed my cats. Dot (girl) is coming up on 6lbs. Boy is clearing 9. They are six months. Sometimes I think he has a pituitary problem b/c he's gigantic and sleeps all the time but he may just be a large cat.

And I am OBSESSED with Ben's Brother song Stuttering. It's just a demo/half song for their next album that got used for a Dentyne ice commercial but I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Seriously, it's on repeat and it's only 90 seconds long. Check it out at their myspace under Ben's Brother.

Alright, now I go to class."

<lj-cut text=""My Week So Far"">

Monday: I already covered in the Seton post before this. 

Tuesday: took my Anat practical, thought I did pretty well. Did my best parallel parking job EVER into a free space  at Rio Grande campus. I had lost a bet to my sister last week, so I took her out for a pad thai at Madam Mam's, my #2 pad thai of all time. Then we drove down to TX State to see a play for her ""freshman experience"" class, which is like UT's freshie seminars. It was the Importance of Being Ernest, pretty cute, although I think it's an odd choice to call someone Bunbury. and even more awkward to say Bunbriest. Plus there were refreshments afterwards, so that was a plus. 

Wednesday: nothing much, my off day. I took the plunge and registered for the GRE so I'll be taking it October 15. I've been putting it off b/c I wanted to study for it, but my app is due Dec. 1 and I have other things to be worrying about so I just need to fill in the scantron and move on. 

Thursday: Found out I got a 97 on my practical and a 100 on my stats test, which was only mildly dampened by my bitterness that UT is making me retake this inane stats class. If this isn't proof that I don't need it, then I don't know what they want. Today in lab we started cat dissection, but the prof used our groups cat as the class demonstration so I didn't get to do any actual cutting. Plus, he's done it all so my cat's all ripped up already. For lunch, I made myself my signature ""sushi bowl"" dish, which is actually me dumping all the California Roll ingredients into a bowl b/c I'm too lazy to actually roll and cut it. It's hella good. I even got my dad into it.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""A New ESB?!?"">
Tonight UT called me to ask for their yearly donation, which I haven't been contributing b/c I'm still trying to make back the 15K my parents already sunk into that place. But then they told me I could make it specific (i.e. not to an even bigger Megatron), such as the new ESB building they're planning for next spring. That's right folks (and more specifically Saida since only she spent as much time as I did in that stinky old building), the ESB is being torn down. They've canceled all labs for next semester, which seems a little sudden but I guess they finally had enough of the leaky labs and the bacterial bio-hazard that is the 2nd floor incubator. Whatever the reason, they're retiring her. And as much as I complained about her, I probably spent months of my life in that place-if you add it all up. I shall miss her. Campus is changing so much! I'm gonna be lost when I go back.  </lj-cut> 

<lj-cut text=""I'm Marrying Bad Music And You Can't Stop Me"">
In other news, I am IN LOVE with bad music. Specifically Brit's Cold as Fire and Heidi Montaug's Body Language. The awesomest bad music can get. A friend played me HM's as a joke so we could make fun of it, but I ended up loving it. And Brit's was so annoying at first that I couldn't listen to it, but after a couple of weeks it's really grown on me. Anyone around might think you're a fan of some kindergarten singing sensation, but you just have to turn it up and forget who's watching b/c there's pink, bubblygum fun to be found in bopping your head to it. 

I have no shame when it comes to my love of bad music. I realized it the other week, when defending my choices to said friend. She doesn't like ""pop music"" b/c it's processed and cookie cutter, etc. etc. Nevermind that her top five are all male guitarist, Jon Mayer wannabes. But then I pointed out that not liking pop music b/c it's dumb is like not liking Cheetoh's because they're unhealthy. The only ingredient you may recognize on the bag is cheddar cheese, but that doesn't change the fact that they are crazy tasty! So she can stick that in her pipe and smoke it.

So, shake them haters off and turn up the music."

"event","first things first, as has been discussed everywhere Britney's VMA performance was a disaster. I have purposely been not paying attention to the media. I still have hope for her, and sincerely want her to succeed.  I'm totally rockin to the songs and am looking forward to the CD. We'll see where she is six months.  Favs are Gimme More, Been Awhile, and Your... (which I think is a really cute song). 

2ndly, school is going alright. My first test is on Thursday and for whatever reason, I have zero motivation to study. Let's hope I do better than Britney. I've got Anatomy and it's lab in the mornings. The prof is from New Jersey and is a really good professor, interesting, informative, and personable. My lab group means well but listening to them is like watching an episode of Newport Harbor. Which although it maybe interesting, is really really annoying b/c of the valley accent. 

In the afternoons I go downtown to the Rio Grande campus for Statistics for Behavioral Sciences. I hate it. I can't tell you how much I hate it. First off, I've already taken Statistics for Bio majors, which is apparently not good enough for UT's nursing program b/c they're making me retake this. And while I admit I'm a bit rusty on chi-square and all that jazz, I do have a very strong background in science. The rest of the class makes me want to jam my pen in my eye. The professor  has spent two hours going over how to identify hypotheses and the difference between an independent and dependent variable. And people are still confused. Seriously. B/c they ask questions, which wouldn't be so bad, except that La Professora likes to interrupt them mid question to answer what she thinks is the question, when it really isn't, thus confusing them even more. It's just so frustrating b/c I've designed and conducted my own research while the person next me can't differentiate between the subject and the condition. I feel like Elaine on Seinfield, when the subway gets stuck and she's cursing in her head. and the kicker is, b/c they don't have a parking lot I have to use metered parking, so I have to pay 1.50 everyday to go to a class I hate. If she didn't take roll and use it in the grade, i would skip the first six weeks. rant over. for now. 

I volunteer at Seton once a week. Right now I'm at the admit/pre-op desk, doing intake. It's really just paperwork, so for two of the four hours I'm usually highlighting stuff. It's hella boring, but the people are nice. I'm on the waiting list for a position in the ER or surgery. Basically I'm doing it to shove my foot in the door. We'll see where it leads.

Whoever remixed it is a genius, b/c I think it's a good song to come back with. Now she just has to not do anything crazy until the VMAs, I'm not sure how to bet on that. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for a kickass video and a good VMA performance.  I think it'd be a good dance song, so hopefully she's got something amazing in her stripper outfit pockets. I really want her to  come back, b/c I'm totally ready to forgive the no underwear and shaving of the head. Whether she's a good mother or not, well, that I just have to hope she figures out soon.

Love Story--Kat McPhee
Nothin Better to Do--Leann Rhimes
Umbrella--Marie Digby (it's acoustic and 10x better than Mandy Moore's)
In The Morning--Junior Boys (electronica, the song from So You Think--the mannequin dance)

"event","well, I just got back from Texas State where I was the acting parent of my incoming freshman sister, since neither of my parents were available. I was asked twice whether she was my actual child. I was tempted to make up a story about being a 14 yr old mom, but thought it might go wrong. They split us up, so that the parents and I could go to our own parent orientation.  And omg, was it the most boring thing I've sat through since geology (sedimentary flow rate anyone?) . They repeat things over and over; they explained what a syllabus was 5 times. I mean really. Even if I didn't know what office hours were when i got there, I knew after the first two times. It seemed to be directed at parents from towns with populations of 12 (which there actually are a few in Texas) who had no idea what to expect at college. Did you know professors are typically harder than high school teachers? I was crawling up the walls. So after Marylea registered, I skipped my last two info sessions and we left early. 

But it's not what I expected. It's bigger than I thought, but just as high school-ish. I felt like I was being babied the entire time, and Marylea said she felt the same way too. It wasn't well organized, as if they were a new school and still figuring things out. One thing that I did like, they have a part of the river running across campus that you can tube around! Holla! I sooooo want to do it. Just float around and watch all the punks going to class. hehe.

I'm about to wrap up my summer Nutrition class, which means two tests, a final and a paper due between Mon, Tues, and Thurs of next week. My professor is obviously as bad at time management as I am. So I'll be spending my July 4th studying. Boo.

Week after that I'll go visit the grandparents in Cali for a week and see the brother unit too. No other plans for sure since I'll have stitches in my scalp. Yesterday I had a precancerous mole removed from my thigh and in about 10 days I'll get a couple taken off my scalp. They kind of excavate it so it takes about 4 stitches, not too bad, but to keep pressure on it and where they are, they wanted to wrap my head turban like for a couple of days. But since I'll be flying, they said I could where a baseball cap. yay, a reason to wear hats! I've never had stitches before but I think the wrapping is pinching me more than the actual stitches hurt. And taking a shower was a trick to keep them dry. Sorry if it's TMI.

I'm loving So You Think You Can Dance, and obsessively listening to The Chairman's Waltz--which is the instrumental cello piece Wade choreographed the ""hummingbird"" routine to. Man, that dance was amazing. I had grown a little tired of Wade's wierdo style in the last few routines but this one blew me away. I'm more a fan of the dances, than the dancers at the moment.  I loved the krumping piece, the rumba ( the leg balance thingie was so seamless!) and Dan's Oh Timbaland would've been good with the right dancers. The girl who got kicked off this week was so pissed! And she was kinda right, b/c in my opinion I don't think she deserved to go home. 

Also keeping me from writing my paper are the joy's of my life- I got two Siamese mix kittens and they are fabulous. Girl and boy littermates, and they play all day. And they're the most affectionate kittens I've ever owned,which is apparently a Siamese trait. They love to nap with you, and will move if you move so that you're always touching. It's the most adorable thing. They are the first cats my parents have allowed to be inside for more than five seconds, so I'm muy happy.  The girl's called Dot b/c she has a dot on the tip of her tail and the boy is called Boy or Biff. Loves em.

Tidbit: I was looking on wikipedia about EV3--the group En Vogue became after losing a member. Well, they eventually got another 4th. And that was Rhona, from MMC--tall black girl who sang all. the. time. Also, Nikki from Emerald Cove. I don't know why, but I was completely shocked. I just flipped it. It never gets mentioned when they talk about those guys so I thought I'd share.

Other than that, no boy or job to speak of. There's a cutie in my class that'd be fun to hit sixth with but not boyfriend material. Lakeline mall called last night to say Hollister was getting broken into. Guess nobody told them I quit six months ago. I'm still planning on Masters in Nursing at UT but going to PA school is creeping around in my head, so i guess I should get off my bass and investigate. Also notable, my sister turned legal so lock your doors.

Have a happy 4th! Live free, think free!"

B/c based on his kissing scene he looks like he's gotten good at that too. And a happy surprise, he turns 21 in June, so not all that much younger. While he's not classically hot, he's come a long way since his curly haired days on the Disney channel. He's got three movies out this summer:  Disturbia, Transformers, and Surf's Up (the animated surfing penguins movie). And I just might have to see all of them.

Disturbia is the first good movie I've seen in awhile as I've been on a bit of a sucking streak.  Here are my spoiler free reviews.

<b> Disturbia</b>, obviously I liked it. Good thriller, exciting, and Shia filled. <b> A
Shrek 3 </b>was pretty good, but not as good as 1 or 2. <b>B
Spiderman 3</b> was alright. Not up to its own standard, and it definitely would've tanked had it been the first one. You know it's not good when the audience starts laughing, b/c Tobey's crying. For it's visual imagery it gets a<b> B-
Stomp the Yard (DVD)</b>, which I was looking forward to for some good dancing but the crumping and stomping were not so visually pleasing.<b> C+ </b>for good dancers and including Darren Hensen in the cast. 
<b>Happily N'Ever After (DVD) </b>was a complete let down b/c I thought it was gonna be really cute.<b> C
Zoom (DVD) </b>the biggest let down of all b/c it had so much potential. <b>C-</b>
 
We'll see how the rest of the summer plays out. I've got a lot of high hopes so it could be really bad or really good."

"event","so it's been a long time since I updated a ya'll on my happenings. Things at work have just been soooo crazy, I can't even describe. And if I did it would take pages. So I'll cut to the end. I quit. Saturday will be my last day. It feels kind of like the end of school. Love the people, fond memories of the place and events but ready to move on.  so hopefully there's a better job out there for me and I can find it. I've promised myself no more retail.  A job w/ regular hours, weekends and holidays. And hopefully has benefits. Anywho, that's what's up. Hope everyone had a rockin Christmas and New Years. Here I come 2007!"

"event","Finally made it back to Austin, things are back to normal. Just a quick blurb to say that I had a blast this past weekend. Friday I stayed home b/c I felt sick, so that on Saturday I was ready to get out of the house and went out for some shopping.  First, I hit up Kohl's, it's so wierd going back.  I saw Nic, Adrienne, and Jarret--who has grown a lumberjack beard. He said he was going as Castro to Chelsea's party that night, although he hardly seems like the type to dress up.  They gave me a flyer for the party but I had no costume, so I headed over to Walmart b/c i needed a brake light and picked up some face paint and fairy wings while waiting in line. afterwards, I was desperately trying to find someone to see The Prestige with but no luck. I hit up Amy's for some icecream-- I've been on an icecream kick ever since Humble, I haven't eaten any in forever but not being able to have it there made me want it. Of course, I always want what I can't have.  So, I decided to go w/ plan B and watch the UT game w/ Jinny at Pluckers since I coincidentally was wearing a UT shirt . But when we got there it was so packed we headed across the road to Sherlock's and proceeded to drink down the cocktails list. I never enjoyed football so much. Watson's Cosmo, Texas Tea, Emerald Martini--we hit all the ones that sounded interesting. Four for me and five for her.  We also played hangman, got hit on by some odd old guy, put a note in a jack-0-lantern (which I be they won't find until they take the decorations down on Wed), and angry texted Freemyer for being a girl. Literally, he was putting on makeup. Also, the bartender was dressed/undressed as Tom Cruise in Risky Business and had no pants on, so that added some fun. I called him Tom and threw napkins at him, but Jinny thinks he looks like a white Khai. Which I can kinda see.

 About midway through the third quarter we decided to go back to her house and get ready to go out, w/ a quick stop at my house to get some shoes. I ended up wearing Jinny's bee costume from last year and she went as a naughty nurse. Vy and Sam came over as ghangsta and vampire.  Jinny had some fun putting on eyeliner for him, but it turned out rather well. He added some fake blood and we were good to go. A quick stop at Wendy's b/c neither J or I had eaten, and then to where else--Element.  Then I froze my ass off as we walked the 5 or 6 blocks to that bar next to Treasure that I can never remember the name of, hopped over to Spill, and then downstairs to some bar I'd never been to and can't remember the name of either. It was some fun times. I even made it to work on time and was completely functional the next day. I miss having the weekend off, one more thing about retail that sucks.

In conclusion...

Best costume: four guys w/ interlocking Tetris piece costumes. Genius! first I saw them in the street and then in a club, hilarious!
Funniest: Flava Flav--complete w/ 16 hoes shouting his name
Memorable quote: ""I.AM.A.BEE!!""--my reason for being so cold, while everyone was loving the coldness

"event","I've been meaning to post but the one computer in the ""business center"" at the hotel, which was really a closet w/ a desk in it, was ""out of order"" since Monday night. Brillant. Anywho, they decided i could come home on Thursday but apparently forgot to tell the hotel or security about it.  My hotel key stopped working, so i had to run in the rain from the side entrance where they let you park to the front check in desk. Thank you Comfort Inn.  And then my security code for the store expired on Wed., which no one told me. So when I opened at 6 am Thursday I couldn't turn the alarm off. And since it was 6 fucking A.M. no one was at home office that could help me, the store and district managers were still asleep, and b/c it's a new store for me I don't have the local lp's number. I called like 10 people that morning and got zero help.  So I got to talk w/ mall security and then the Humble police came out (an hour and a half later, nice response time) to take down my ID info, etc. (p.s. the police arrived while I was in the bathroom. of course.) But all in all, I think I handled it well. We managed to redress all the mannequins, put up new photo marketing, and all the Christmas decorations. Yes I said Christmas.   anywho, I managed to get out of the store around 3 and miss most of the Houston and Austin traffic. That makes two 12 hour shifts in a row. I almost fell asleep on the way home, it was horrible. I'm glad to be home. Mostly. But all my stuff still reaks of the hotel b/c they didn't have anymore non smoking rooms to give me. Apparently all Humble hotels were booked that weekend, I have no idea why. sure it's close to the airport, but it's freaking Humble.  whatevs. but now that I've been gone, I don't have a halloween costume. oh well.

"event","so Hollister sent me to Humble for the second week in a row and it's boring as hell. Well, the first time they sent another manager down w/ me so it was fun. But this week i'm in a smelly hotel w/ no roomate. And the store is hellish b/c we're having to redo the entire floor but half the kids don't show up, so it's a big fucking mess. the only silver lining is that the new store manager is hot. like really hot. with some hot on top. but he has a gf (who likes to watch him work and it's soooooo annoying b/c she lives 45 minutes away and drives to stand and watch him work. God, please don't ever let me become like that) plus, we don't usually work together. the last two days I've been managing 10 hours a day, alone, which means no breaks--and I have to send out kids to bring me back food. so I just needed to vent a little here. plus, there's a freakin cheerleader squad staying on my floor that plays tag at night. oh, it's just fabulous. hopefully I'll get to go home on Tuesday, but that's yet to be decided. yeah, I don't even know that yet. gonna keep my fingers crossed."

"event","so yes, it's been forever since I posted. here's a quick update:

1. the job. it's going alright, I've found a decent rhythm w/ the kids and the store. half the days I know it's not for me, the other half I can see myself doing this for awhile. especially since I think I'm the only one available for transfer to another store. and I've spent an outrageous amount of money there. and we get a new color next week which means I'll be buying more.

2. the boy. non existant. I might have told ya'll about the party I went to w/ Jarret and his renewed gf and she locked herself in her room. but i went again, to their last party and she and I sang songs together for an hour. so all is good in the hood.

3. the apt. still haven't moved out. the rents wigged when I started talking about it. but there comes a time when you just gotta get out. 
plus it's about a 26 mile commute each way to work.

other news: Jinny's pre birthday weekend was had. I only made it out one night and I feel like a punk, but this weekend i go out to Miami to see her! and we shall live it up!

and now for some serious news. I feel it is my duty to warn all of you.  Do you remember a movie that went straight to video a little while ago, w/ Aaron Carter called Popstar? he's a popstar that goes back to high school to pass math. Well, it's super horrible and the whole time Marylea and I are like there's something familiar... it feels like Longshot... and then. at the end. who makes a cameo but the fat devil himself. Uncle Lou.  I should've known. I totally forgot about that man. meanwhile, the Carters have a new show coming up on E! where it's the Carter siblings Real World style. Looks like rehab house to me. 

A short musical review, in my opinion.
1. Christina A. There's only about 5 songs I like on the two disc set. I little disapointed. Not worth the buy.
2. Timberlake. My Love is awesome of course. and I have a feeling the disc will grow on me, it's just a little sad and slow towards the end. So when I play it in the store I have to skip some songs.
3. N. Furtado. By far, my favorite disc. I'm lovin it! Totally suggest it to anyone. It's got a great range of songs. My fav. to dl would be All Good Things. bittersweet but irresisble.

looking forward to hearing Jojo's new stuff, I think in October."

"event","it's about 1:30 am, which isn't late for a Friday night--or any night. But I've gotten four hours in the last two days, I should be tired. I feel a little tired but I can't seem to make my mind stop. So here I am. Texting friends that are downtown.  The weekend of all weekends to get sick. Jinny's in town. Beth's in town. Geez.

So what's up with me? No sleep b/c I had to take my dad to the dr's/surgeons this morning so he could have an implant put in. Long story, it's nothing major, but he was given anesthesa so I had to drive him. So I've been up since six. And once I'm up, I'm up. 

anywho, good news. I quit my job at Kohl's. Well, officially I won't turn in my resignation until tomorrow/ later today, but it's going to happen because...I've been offered a job at Hollister. So I guess I haven't told ya'll the story. Two weeks ago I took my sister birthday shopping b/c she turned 17. She wanted A&F, which I never go to, but we went. While we were checking out the manager came up and offered me an interview for manager in training. She said I had the right look, and after she found out I had retail experience she was ecstatic. So I interviewed last week w/ the district manager and it went alright. A&F also own Hollister, which they are opening later this month in Lakeline (about 30 mins from my house), so they referred me over there. Yesterday I interviewed w/ the Hollister people and today they made me an offer, so bad-a-bing that's the story. And it works out well b/c I had requested time off from Kohl's to go to California, so techinically my two weeks ends while I'm on vaca. Kinda nice. So if you wanted to abuse my 15% discount at Kohl's now's the time. I start at Hollister July 31st, which gives me a good reason to buy a bunch of clothes. Let's hope my discount (30%!) starts soon. 

And even though it only happened a few hours ago, it's all over my family network in California. My sister was giddy w/ excitement after the initial stop in the store that she told my dad and my mom, who's out near Sacramento, that night while I was at work. Well that just spread like wildfire. It's like mentioning you have a first date. They take it and run w/ it. Anybody else have this problem? And that is exactly why I don't bring anyone home or even mention it--same for interviews. Marylea hadn't realized it yet, so I've let her know. My parents weren't too thrilled, especially my mom. ""it's so far!"" on and on. but it's an opportunity for me. There's no place to move up to in Kohl's and this is a better offer. and even if it doesn't go anywhere I needed the change. I think she was just set on me going back to school and she sees this as a step in the wrong direction. But I've already accepted and she'll have to deal.  Meanwhile, my sister is overjoyed with the prospect of a Hollister wardrobe. 

sidestory: the Hollister district manager that I interviewed w/ has a bio degree and got recruited instore just like me. After three weeks as an MIT she got promoted to asst. manager and a couple monthes later, got the whole store. She's really taken off, and has only been w/ the company for three years but is doing great. So this has potential. But I just thought how crazy was it that we both had the same background?!

And that's pretty much all the news. all the good or interesting stuff anyway."

It's about growing up pre-1980, which even though I'm post 1980, I grew up in a similar fashion so I got a kick out of it. Hopefully you will too. I took the liberty of bolding things that I actually went through.

1930's 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's !!

First, we survived being born to mothers who smoked and/or drank while they were pregnant. 
They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, tuna from a can, and didn't get tested for diabetes.
Then after that trauma, we were<b> put to sleep on our tummies in baby cribs </b> covered with bright colored lead-based paints.
<b>We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets, not to mention, the risks we took hitchhiking. </b>
As infants & children, we would ride in cars with no car seats, booster seats, seat belts or air bags.
<b>Riding in the back of a pick up on a warm day was always a special treat.
We drank water from the garden hose and NOT from a bottle.
We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and NO ONE actually died from this.
We ate cupcakes, white bread and real butter and drank koolade made with sugar, but we weren't overweight because WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING !</b>
We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on.
No one was able to reach us all day. And we were O.K.
We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then ride down
The hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.
<b>We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at all, no 150 channels on cable, no video movies or DVD's, no surround-sound or CD's, no cell phones, no personal computer! S, no Internet or chat rooms....... WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them!
We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no lawsuits from these accidents.
We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever.
We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays, made up games with sticks and tennis balls and, although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes.
We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just walked in and talked to them!</b>
Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. Imagine that!!
The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law! Unless your name was Bush, then you had it made and could do no wrong!
These generations have produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever!
The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas.
We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned HOW TO DEAL WITH IT ALL!</lj-cut>

I just find it crazy compared with today. Congrats to us."

"event","I got my car back yesterday! It's all shiny and new! And all the bugs that I could never get cleaned off from the road trips are gone! It's gross but they're gone! And even though it wasn't damaged in the crash, I got my windshield replaced--just to do it all at once. No more giant crack! It's beautimus. Now I'll just have to back into something to get my back end replaced and I'll have a whole new car! that's some good logic there.

just gonna say Eight Below was good and I'm looking forward to Running Scared. How long into the movie will PW appear shirtless? Whatever it is, I'm sure it's too long for me.

Also, I finished reading the Chronicles of Narnia, or the Narniad as it's called. Good stuff. And I started Hiroshima and War of the Worlds. Both excellent. And then it occured to me that I've been reading a lot of violent books. Gotta get back to Jane Austen or something.

oh and my new phrase --""They're going like bagels!""-Heidi Klum (meaning hotcakes)
she is the cutest adult alive! The way she talks! Love it! Although I did hate her for like five minutes for not wearing Jay's dress and not having the balls to call him herself. But she's still cute. ""Hot mama on fire!""

Carry on.

ps. Tim Gunn on Best Week Ever! If he did read the news I might actually watch it. Sad but true."

"event","I was so ready to give up O.C. I had stopped watching before the break b/c there were just too many things on at the same time, but now that they've moved the time I can watch again. It's a sad reason to watch, and yet I did. I finally thought Ryan and Marissa would break up but instead they just killed some poor kid. That's so Newport.  And Marissa's little sister? Combine two of the most annoying people on Earth (Marissa/Mischa Barton and Avril Lavigne) and that's what you get. And Seth, you really are a loser. 

Project Runway: best show ever. I totally didn't expect it to be as good as last season, but it's better. I'm so in love with Dan and Nick. 

Gilmore Girls: I've decided that I do not like Logan. Again. I think Rory belongs with Jesse and Loralie belongs with Christopher. I love Luke, but Christopher will always be Christopher."

I didn't watch the game last night, but went to bed around the 12th inning. Good baseball. Too bad I'm not motivated to watch it. Poor Houston.  But I'm liking the HEB commercials Andy and Roger have been in. Cute.

"event","Spent the night at J.Co's last night, rented Amityville Horror about the family that moves into a house haunted by the family that was murdered there. It was no bueno for me b/c it actually scared us, we literally screamed-twice. But it was also fairly unrealistic, we yelled alot at the stupid people on screen. Silver lining: Ryan Reynolds shirtless. I think he did this film after Blade Trinity b/c the boy is RIPPED. RIPPED! Like Batman suit ripped. It's insane. Jen and I couldn't figure out how Alanis snagged him but she is one lucky girl.

Also, my sister got Saturday school this weekend, aka Breakfast Club. haha! for being tardy three times this semester, which seems excessive to me but I'm still laughing b/c she's totally Molly Ringwald. She came home and was like, ""But I don't belong there!! What am I gonna do?"" 

so now I'm gonna go get her some diamond earings because I don't think she can do the lipstick/bra thing."

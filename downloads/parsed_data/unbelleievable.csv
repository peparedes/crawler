"event","this weekend was one of the best in a while... 

friday- sara, beth, and i went to noodles n company for dinner at like 7.. and then we just stayed there and talked for like 2 hours. it was so much fun tho... beth- i hope you win the asparagas queen... your so full of fiber... lol... but then when we finally decided to leave.. at like 9.. we come outside and we realize that sara left her car lights on.. so she's like.... shiiiit... what if my car doesn't start?!?! and surely enough.. it doesnt. SO, tan texts her and says.. hey i'll be off work in 15... and sara texts him back saying.. uhm.. then we're stranded here for another 15... so then we attempt to jump start her car! i was so proud cus i just learned in drivers ed how to properly do it... so i assisted!! and at about 9 30... we were off and running. but during that time beth sara and i made up a new cheer for the badminton team for conference the next day... so then at like 10 30 sara and i made cookies.. then fell asleep. 

saturday- bus leaves at 7! Varsity to plainfield south... and JV to oswego east i believe. So anyway, the hour long bus ride to cornfield country was a blast lol. beth and i taught the varsity the cheer.. and it was fun... we finally got there and our coach drives the raider bus over the grass and sidewalk on their school property.. it was really funny but some girls who were driving in the parking lot looked at us very surprised.. coach was like... dont tell your coach that we just did that... yaaaa... so then the meet was really long but really really fun. Esther and i won our doubles!!! 1st place out of the 6 schools... and then i won my singles!! 1st out of 6! all conference babyyy!! and our school got 1st place over all. it was so much fun and i am so proud of how we all did. we worked hard. after we got back.. we all went to bk... then i met up with sara.. and she won her singles too! congrats sara!!! and yeah.. so then i showered and hung out with sara genie brad and tim.. we watched a night at the roxbury then went to the condomm park. it's a park by edison middle school.. and there is this ""ride"" i guess you can say, that looks like a big condom... you spin around in it and it gets you all sick lol. so then we went bowling.. taht was fun.... :-*

sunday- woke up at like 12... then i had to go to church with my sis to practice for her confirmation... im her sponsorer so i had to go too. so im doin hw all night.. got so much.. blah... but my parents are comin home from DC tonight.. i havent seen them since wednesday! oh and i can't wait for britney spear's new show to start.. may 17th i think.. haha it's gonna rule"

"event","so there was a meet today against lake park for badminton. they're really good. i seriously thought i was gonna pass out... in singles, the girl i played kept moving me around the court and i felt like i ran a marathon... it was crazy. after the meet the team (well some of it) went to chili's and that was really fun. EVERYONE (no joke) was there tonight... from the people i babysit for... to friends... to cousins... it's crazy! chili's is the place to be at on friday nights i guess... ha. but yeah. it was fun cus a whole bunch of us just gossiped while we were waiting for our food. gossiping is so much fun, it's so bad, but so fun. so it was an interesting night... 

so tomorrow i go on my 30 hour famine to raise money for the hungry in this one country. 30 hours with no food! im gonna keel over and die! but it's for a good cause

i want my nose pierced, i want it to be summer, i want my license, i want to swim, i want to go to sleep, so good night"

"event","wow this weekend was pretty sweet.
friday!- drove to crystal lake to surprise lisa... her ""surprise sweet 16 party"" was that night. so i got to marielle's house where lisa was at (clueless) and i ring the doorbell and marielle has lisa go and answer it. She sorta stares at me for like a few seconds, as if she doesn't recognize me lol, then she just starts screaming her face off. it was so funny. i was so happy to see her! i haven't seen her since like september. so then us 3 hung out for a bit.. then we went to target, and as we were driving... we went under street lights, and within 1 mile, 3 of them turned off as we went under them! it was so freaky. so then we went back to marielle's house to pick up marielle's brother for his ""party"" at lazer zone or whatever their lazer quest is called... and then we got there and lisa went in and all her friends were there surprising her. it was cute. then we played lazer tag for like 2 hours then we went to nick's pizza.. good place.. i didn't get home until like 1 that night and i had to get up at like 6 30 for badminton!!! aaah.. but it was good... so then..........
saturday!- badminton invite! it was awesome, i was so tired but it was still fun. jessica p. was my doubles partner, and we kicked butt!! we beat all the schools there (total of 6) except for gb west, but it was intense. South varsity placed in 2nd overall, and JV placed in 3rd. it was awesome. that night i babysat... it was pretty boring...

"event","ugh, i just wish it would be spring break. the next two weeks are gonna be crazy, but fun i guess. im not doin too much over break.. i might drive up to wis. to see my cousin... dont know though. it'll be a lay-low break. 

 so i watched first daughter tonight cus sara and i felt like watching a chick flick.. it was sorta good in the beginning... but the end was horrible! but like normally, chick flicks can give you like a short.. i dunno.. high i guess, cus your all caught up in the movie and it's all ""love and happiness"" then about an hour later, reality hits and your like... wow this sucks.  

but wow im so excited for badminton. im on varsity! yay! this season is gonna rock. but we're trying to come up with different slogans for our T-shirts... but all of them get rejected by the atheltic directors. we had like ""flip the bird, side or serve"" and ""boys like BADminton GIRLS"" or just plaing ""BADminton girls"" but nope, ""they're wayyyy to connotative"". we can't help it... our sport: we play with a shuttlecock.. our coach's name is woodcock... we smash... we flip birds...the list goes on. so if you have any ideas for a slogan, tell me!"

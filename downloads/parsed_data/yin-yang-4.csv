"event","so today was my day off, which was the ONLY day off this week, and I got called in because they couldn't figure out how to put one of the peices to fit on the roller machine. which of course everyone has trouble with (except me). so I went in to work which takes about twenty minutes to get there, just to put a single pieve onto a machine. ::sigh:: one thing I will say, my job keeps me on my toes. :p :p :p
tonight is the reel-films bible study related movie night. we will be showing Evan Almighty. should be interesting. not sure if alot of the usual people will come, mainly cause we didn't send out our usual notification about it. its okay though, I text messaged everyone. wish us luck."

I need some added support from my brothers and sisters!  God has called me to spend some time outside of Las Vegas with a youth group called The Edge.  The only downside is I need a little help getting there.  The obvious need is prayer.  I have been asked to spend a little time getting to know the kids their and help them grow with God.  They have 95 kids in their youth group.  I would also be spending this time in a place where I only know a handful of people and would need to rely on them to get me through and around town.  Also, I need a couple hundred dollars.  That is it.  If you would be willing to help me out in any way, it would be much appreciated.  I am still in Arizona as I type this, so if you are willing to bless me financially, get anything to my mom, Lorrie Klem, at 9 Sunshine Court, Bloomington, IL  61704.  Include a note that it is for me.  She will make sure I get the money. 
 
A few updates, since I have your attention:
 
1) A summer working at United Christian Youth Camp has been amazing; illuminating, encouraging, burning (spiritually on this one), and a blessing!  I thank all of you who prayed for me while I was out here.  It really helped! 
 
2) The book of poetry I wrote, ""simple words for God from a simple man of God"" by daniel m klem, is not only available at www.PublishAmerica.com, but I found out on Monday, August 13, that Spring Arbor, the Christian division of Ingram book distributors (and the second largest Christian book distributor), has picked it up for distribution! 
 
3) I have been asked if next June I would be willing to go backpacking in the Himalayas to distribute Bibles for a month.  I will have more details later, but it would be an amazing experience to reach out to Muslims and see one more part of the world.  It would also cost around $3275 to go. 
 
That is about what I have to say for now (in a brief message).  I love you!  I am praying for you!
 
Blessings and peace in our Lord!
 
Daniel"

"event","so I dropped my mom off at the automotives, and aked the guy there if he could check my car later in the week. I gave him my number and info like that. There was one girl there waiting for her car to be finished as well, and overheard me giving out my number, so he just happened to remember it. she started text messaging me and asked her to take my number off her list. that's just kinda creepy."

"event","so yesterday, I went to work, got home and only spent less than an hour there when Jeremiah calls me up. He was supposed to call me, but I didn't expect it to be that soon. So I go over there, and we both go to Home Depot to pick up their rental truck. While there, I met with two girls that I knew in the past; one who used to go to Fuel, and the other that used to work at the pretzel place at the mall. Anyways, we get the truck and go to the furniture store to pick up a huge chair that Jeremiah bought, and took it over to his new apartment where he will soon be moving to. The whole way we talked about the most random stuff. it was hilarious. Then we went back to his other apartment and watched a movie before I had to go back to work at 5. Left work at 8:30, went home finally, and crashed around some late hour. 

Today, went to work, then went to the Interstate Center because the quilt show was going on and I had my egyptian quilt entered into the show. No, I didn't win. After the show ended, I helped my mom and a bunch of other people tear down everything because I volunteered. I just got home to check e-mail and my livejournal, myspace, and facebook. Now, I'm gonna get ready to go to Fuel, and after that go to Game Night with Jeremiah and James."

We actually didn't watch Borat (thank God). Instead we saw Son in Law. Yaay Paulie Shore!
half the time I was watching the movie I was also playing Tetris on my phone and texting Jenna. I was still paying attention to the movie though, darn it!"

"event","So for Christmas I got:
- two long sleeve shirts
- a reversible vest that looks like the one from Back to the Future
- a clippers set for when I cut my own hair
- a Nightmare Before Christmas clock from Dan
- a Cable comic book from Special. Thanks Special!
- my LG CU500 cell phone that I got a month ago from my mom
- Fearless DVD from my brother

I got my brother a gift card that works like a debit card anywhere.
I got my mom a gift card to Hancock Fabrics, and a walking stick. I can explain that one. On my birthday my family went to Starved Rock. While there, my mom said she wanted me to pick out a tree limb of her choice, and wanted me to make it look nice and give it to her as a Christmas present. So, I cut off all the bark, sawed off every limb and sand papered the whole thing down. Then I woodburned quilt patters over the entire staff, and finally varnished it and drilled a hole at the top to put the handle through. needless to say it took a while. 
I hope Special got her gift in time. 
That's pretty much all the people I got gifts for. I got James a six-pack of Guiness, but that's also because he installed my new stereo. 
Merry Christmas to all. Ohh yeah, if your offended by me saying Merry Christmas and want me say Happy Holidays,


MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!"

"event","Not really, though. I've taken two or three of them today, along with two pennicilin. All I feel is a little lightheaded. 
In case you all don't know why I'm taking these drugs, I had my wisdom teeth out today. Yep, all four of them. 
I woke up this morning at 3:00 to do my paper route, got back home at 5:00 and took a nap till 8:00. It was a little tough, cause I usually work up an appetite after walking for two hours. But I wasn't able to eat anything for 6 hours prior to my appointment. 
My mom drove me to the place aroung 9:30 and they started after 10:00. The laughing gas they gave me didn't do anything. They stuck the IV into the side of my wrist, prolly cause that was the biggest vein they could find. The thing I didn't like about that was I could feel the needle inside me the whole time I was awake. They gave me more laughing gas (which still didn't work) and then stuck the annestesia in my tube. It didn't take long after that till I passed out. 
When I woke up I felt fine. I could pay attention to everything and walk easily. Basically for the rest of the day my mom took care of me, getting me my pills, and mashed potatoes, and strawberry jello. yum. There's still pudding in the fridge that I haven't touched yet. 
So anyways, I get to take the next two days off work from both jobs. Dan's taking over my route. I guess that's all for now. I get to go back to sleep, or watch more tv. awesome. I actually get to take a real vacation from everything."

Read ""Wal-Mart Partners With Gay and Lesbian Group"" 

Although Wal-Mart has never excluded homosexuals from being employees, customers, or suppliers, the company wanted to be more closely identified with promoting the homosexual agenda. Wal-Mart is now a ""corporate member"" of the NGLCC, putting their approval on the NGLCC's efforts to abolish the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. A Wal-Mart vice president will serve as an advisor to the NGLCC, helping them promote homosexual marriage.

Wal-Mart agreed to give $25,000 to the NGLCC and to pay for two conferences scheduled by NGLCC. Also, Wal-Mart will give homosexual-owned businesses special treatment when making purchases. Companies not owned by homosexuals will be moved down the list."

"event","I got tired of my ""shades"" user pic and put the default back on the Seether eye pic. The story behind why I changed my default to the shades is this:
There was one girl on my ""friends"" list, and I asked her why she never actually put me on her friends list. She replied by quoting one of my past entries about the Ford company promoting homosexuality and that I didn't agree with it. So the reason she never put me on her friends list is because my views are different than hers and apparently that's enough to make or break a friendship. 
And somewhere in all of that, some whacko posted that seether sucks and blah blah blah, so I changed my default pic and deleted her from my friends list. Then after that, another person I know went back to check on former friends list she used to have, quoted a different post of mine that had to deal with the same issues of Ford and why I don't own a car from them, and says ""ohh, now I know why I deleted you in the first place"". 
There is one person who I will keep on my friends list and hope she does the same, and that's Kate. We do have different opinions in this matter, and yet I will still value her friendship regardless of the views we have.
well, this kinda turned into a long story-turned-ranting."

"event","Activist Judge Strikes Down Ban On Homosexual Marriage, Overruling 76% of Georgia Voters

 A liberal activist judge has struck down a constitutional amendment in Georgia which made homosexual marriage illegal! She felt that she knew better than the voters how they should vote and threw out their ballots. 

The constitutional amendment, passed overwhelmingly by 76% of the voters in Georgia, is now null and void. 

The homosexuals are determined to win this battle. They know they will never win if the people have an opportunity to vote. So they are turning to liberal activist judges to force their will on the people. They intend to force homosexual marriage down the throats of Americans. They feel our children must be indoctrinated beginning in kindergarten that homosexuality is normal behavior. 

On June 6 the U.S. Senate will vote on the Marriage Protection Amendment (MPA) which defines marriage as being only between one man and one woman. Because of a power grab by activist judges like the one in Georgia, the MPA is the only way that the sacred institution of marriage will remain between one man and one woman. 

Take Action 
Please call your two U.S. Senators today and tell them to vote for the MPA. If your Senator's lines are busy, please keep trying. They need to hear from you personally. 

The liberal senators who want to legalize homosexual marriage will give you the political run-around. Don't be fooled. Just remember this: If your senator does not vote for the MPA he or she is voting for homosexual marriage. Regardless of the political jargon you get from a liberal senator; that is the bottom line. 

Use the link below to locate the main district office number for your two U.S. Senators along with talking points for your calls. Tell them to vote for the Marriage Protection Amendment. Print out their phone numbers and distribute in your church and Sunday school. Ask others to call! 

The time to act is now. We must not let a handful of activist, liberal, pro-homosexual marriage judges force homosexual marriage on us and our children."

"event","Ford Headed Toward Bankruptcy, But Support Of Homosexual Groups Continues
Ford Motor Company continues to give money to help finance homosexual organizations pushing homosexual marriage. 

Chairman Bill Ford evidently is willing to take Ford into bankruptcy in order to continue support of homosexual groups and homosexual marriage. Ford's sales dropped 5% in March and 7% in April. Ford's stock has dropped more than 14% since the boycott began to the lowest price in nearly 20 years. Some feel the stock, now at $6.78, will be at $3 in a matter of months and are bailing out now rather than lose more money on Ford stock. 
Ford is a ""Platinum Sponsor"" of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading advocate of homosexual marriage. In order to be a ""Platinum Sponsor"" of HRC, Ford had to give HRC $150,000. Other homosexual organizations getting financial support from Ford include GLAAD, Michigan Pride, Triangle Foundation, GLSEN, Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and PFLAG to name only a few. 

In addition, Ford is a corporate sponsor of the 2006 GLAAD Media Awards in which homosexual groups honor companies which have helped them promote their agenda. 

While Ford helps groups promoting the homosexual lifestyle, Ford refuses to give to groups on the other side of the issue. Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays & Gays (PFOX), an organization which helps those who want to come out of the homosexual lifestyle, applied for a grant from Ford. Ford refused to donate to PFOX. 

Ford dealer Dan Janssen told the Detroit News that the boycott was being felt. ""It's something that's just kind of snowballing,"" Janssen said, adding that it is starting to hurt business. For more information on the boycott, visit BoycottFord.com. 


Isn't that sweet? Bill Ford wants to bankrupt the company, lay off every single employee in the nation, so he can support gay marriage to those who most likely don't even like Ford cars. If even then, after bankruptcy, no one's going to buy any Fords anyway. So its never been about the money. Bill has full intentions on laying off the possible thousands upon thousands of people working for Ford."

Apparently, Dan went with his mom to Walmart. No biggie, except the fact that they were there for over two hours and DAN LEFT HIS PHONE IN THE CAR. So then they get home, blah blah blah Dan's tired, and forgot all about it until about 8:15, and Nichole was leaving work around 8:30. 
So long story short, the roses are dead, the little box of chocolates are still at his house, and Nichole still doesn't know anything about it. Whatever.
Yesterday I bought the script to The Pirates of the Caribbean. Sweet."

"event","Dan explained to me some things about a couple foods to stay away from. He has this book called the maker's diet, which basically explains, on a Christian level, what's okay to eat, and what's not. 
So I can stay away from swine (pig) and crustacians.
That means no pepperoni, bacon, ham, porkchops, sausage, ribs, lobster, crab, oysters, shrimp, ect. 
This hurts me on a personal level, seeming how I work at a pizza place, and my favorite toppings are PEPPERONI AND BACON! 
But in all actuality, I have been doing exceedingly well in avoiding all of this. 
Yes it can be hard to stay away from lobster, shrimp, and ham as well. I can't have my second favorite pizza, ham and pineapple (hawiian pizza). Sure there are plenty of other toppings I can have, but they just don't quite replace it as well as my pepperoni and bacon. But you know, plain cheese isn't that bad, either. 
Hope you are all doing okie dokie. Bree, nice pics. ;)

"event","That song is in my head for some odd reason.
Last night, I worked till close with Dan and then we went to James' to play a little Halo. And of course before we left, we had a little cigar. 
Obviously I will never be able to get back into the habit of smoking(and THANK GOD) because it nearly made me really sick. 
Plus around the time we started playing the game I got the hiccups, and didn't really stop until I got home around 2:00 this morning. 
I woke up at 7:00 cause I have class at 8, got out of bed and bam! I got the hiccups again. Geez! Anyway that stopped shortly after, but still, how annoying. I'm supposed to be in my 9:00 class, but it was cancelled. After that class I'm supposed to be at work, so I decided to wait a while before I go in early.

<TD>You are your author's imaginary friend, but you're not really the type of character fiction writers should aim for. 
<P>You're more than a little out of the ordinary. You might have had some really crazy experiences, or have an unusual talent or two. Maybe you were even born with a tail. Whatever it is that makes you unique, it does the job well, because there are very few people like you on this planet. 
<P>A novel with you as a character would be a guilty pleasure to read. It would be considered intellectual junk food, of course, but damn fun to read nonetheless. Even if many people didn't want to pay actual money to read about you and your exploits, surely it would be checked out from the library at least... once every couple of months. </P></TD></TR>

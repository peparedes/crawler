"event","<p>i've been a little off this week, i don't know, i think that the girl i've been seeing has lost interest, but she hasn't said anything to make me think so. i wish i knew what to say to her to get an answer without being offensive, i know she's busy, but she had at least been calling me before. we never had any agreement, it's a relationship based on sex, which is totally unstable.&nbsp; i'm starting to feel like i don't know her very well, which is true, but i've found myself thinking about the fact that it would be curtious of her to tell me one way or another, if she's simply busy, or would rather not continue spending time together because of a lack of interest.&nbsp;<br /><br />i wish i wasn't such a loser, no licence, shitty job. things that would make me more attractive seem to drag down my chances when they're absent.</p>"

"event","last thursday there was a tornado in vancouver, and i can't imagine the odds of that happening. Theres an even smaller chance of where it landed being my street, but thats literally what happened. I had just gotten home from work, and brought the garbage bins down from the street, luckily, because the winds were strong enough to relocate some containers about a half mile.

my mother was out walking the dog when it struck, the side of the road she was walking on had five trees blow over, right where she had been standing.&nbsp; she's incredibly fortunate to not have been hurt. the wind blew her across the street, to safety, and nothing flying through the air hit her. i was even struck just standing on my porch yelling at her to get inside.&nbsp;

i saw trees falling, the power transformer in front of our house exploded, my neighbors car got crushed, dozens of roofs were removed, but my parents' house and all of us came out clean, and free of injury. amazing."

i haven't really thought about how this could effect my life. but facing losing my licence for a year, this close, it's starting to scare me. i don't get out much, but when i do its only because i can get there in my car. getting to work on my bicycle could be shitty during these winter months, but i know i can do it.

maybe i'll not worry about things like that. i should try and give up all my issues for awhile, i don't think i've been getting anywhere as it is, so going with the flow shouldn't make a difference. maybe my answers will come to me."

Like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind
Aim a line straight at mine
To a heart that is broke
Tried to feel but got choked
In the smoke of a desert
A beach with no treasure
A night that seems blue
Feed the aching in you
And the background birds
Take a flight from the earth
A bonfire burns
And the night current turns
On a lifeboat floating
Down a river of sleep
Can't see her hollow eyes
Walking along with my boots full of rocks
Can't believe these tears of mine
I give 'em to you to keep away in a box"

the book ""the silent planet"" had an applicable lesson for this man to learn.&nbsp; the main character had a friendship that came to a terrible halt when this friend was murdered. but it was a good thing in this somewhat alien culture.&nbsp;the end of anybodys friendship was something to be celebrated.. not just for their passing on to heaven or whatever, but for the same reason people celebrate a completed project... as if there was no more wrongs to be suffered between the two, and remembering the friend as good was never going to change&nbsp;who they were..&nbsp;

or how i've said that there is only so much one person can do for another before reaching a point where it hurts you too much to try any harder.. you have to give up or else you'll be digging yourself into a hole, or lowering yourself into theirs'&nbsp;however you want to look at it... but i guess giving up on people isn't really a good lesson to be taught in rehab

i might as well just give up on the money. i should give up altogether, its not worth the stress it's causing me. if they feel like paying me it will be a better feeling to be surprised than to be irritated this whole time.
maybe i'll take out my angst by shooting guns, that seemed to help last payday, even though renting machine&nbsp;guns is expensive.

i won't ask for anything i don't deserve on a silver platter, but trying too hard to earn anything has never been&nbsp;my style. i have a good work ethic, i literally have called in sick twice in 16 months, and one time was because of those fucking banquet pot pies, the other was because i had court. so theres obviously different levels of my effort. things i like i really try to put forth.

but seriously i'm a quitter, i've felt like giving up on a lot of things but if i give up one thing i'll probably drop my whole life down and quit my job and become a jewel thief or something... that sounds more glorious than what i am now

mark isn't the only person pissing me off. my roommate joe owes me $400 fucking dollars for three weeks now, and he totally avoids me. my sister alexandra needs to give a car title to me, but she can't find it, so shes avoiding me too. in fact, she wanted me to do her a favor and buy two cases of champagne, but wouldn't call me herself, she made my mother do it.. i shouldn't even need to start about my mother.&nbsp;

i'm almost worried&nbsp;about my sanity. as mad as i get at anyone, i imagine taking all my anger out on one particular person, one that hasn't done me wrong in a long time, however,&nbsp;the worst blatent disrespect.. i don't think it would bother me in the least to flat out murder him... no one else... just this one guy.... i've had some serious fantasies about killing him and gained pleasure from the thought. for real i'd put his name here but i don't want to end up killing him and getting caught because of livejournal.

did i mention i hate the name mark?&nbsp;

today wasn't bad, some driver got fired, and they took the jackass trainee to work somewhere else, and i got to drive a 45 footer to yacolt... i should have refused since i would go to jail if i was caught, but i really wanted to drive.. i haven't since labor day

i'm getting sick, my throats swollen, and my head is pounding.

well, that wasn't even all whats on my mind. but i don't think i should share that with the world, or anyone. i'm just going to bottle it up and eventually turn that bottle into a molotov.

"event","today shows that it really is true that the best things in life are sometimes the worst mistakes.  of all the problems that i've had i have to be thankful that from it i can offer real advice to one person, advice that can be heard and understood.  even if i can't help those who need it, i can always help those who are willing to accept it.

it feels really good to be able to listen to someone, and not only relate, but feel the same, give advice, and work towards a higher understanding.  i almost can't believe it, i don't even know the guy, but from what i told him i honestly think that he can learn from my mistakes, and those that have been made by certain people i know in similar pitfalls.

the trouble with people, is they're almost all the same.  at least the people the both of us know... i think he feels the way i do when i had been so innocent, before i took a couple bad streets, and hopefully he'll never have to experience what i have.  he's definatley been through enough... i've taken his situation and turned it into a worse one many times, i know how bad he must feel.. but now he knows what paths will only make it worse.  i definately don't know what would make it better, i haven't done that, but at least he can try to keep out of trouble."

"event","last night i felt horrible. 

this guy i vaguely know came up to me and we started talking about annie. 

i don't know where he got his information, but i felt like i just got kicked to the teeth. he said that annie doesn't like me, which i don't give a fuck now.  i figure that she's too high on crack to know anything that goes on around her. including the fact that i'm gone, or that i was ever there to begin with. she's forgotten completely. 

that wasn't what hurt.  dude told me that i was the ONLY person that would be able to get chad and annie to quit smoking dope.  he said that i have to save them, he even insisted that i have to do something after i explained that i've tried too many times already and that its totally impossible.  those two deserve each other, they're going to die soon, cracked out, unhappy, and alone.  fuck them, they wanted this.

i had a dream that annie was selling her body for meth, because chad is in jail (literally) and she had nowhere to feed the dragon... except mikee the dopeman.. its so simple to imagine her not having money and going and getting high, then just putting out, either because she wants it, or because he does. it doesn't make a difference.  she doesn't know what love is. she doesn't care. she's addicted to drugs, sex, and manipulation... but the meth makes her too stupid to be the one in control... she's getting controlled by anyone that's around. 

i'd cry, but its too late. i don't care anymore."

"event","just a little over two years ago, i went to a party at madison's house.  i won't forget it, because it was a radical huge rave party in a million dollar house with probably about a hundred people.  it was one of the first times i ever rolled, so i was really high and diggin the groove. 

oh yeah, the point.  even though i had a girlfriend at that point, i really had this feeling of dumping her, if i could have gotten away with it and not had to have driven her home.  it sounds bad yeah, but she was being really annoying at the party, and it was either the first time i met mo or the first time i hung out with her. 

i snuck into one of the rooms with mo and we were given each other massages, and that was the closest we have probably ever been talking to each other and bullshit, because my girl had barged into the room and shut it down, mo didn't try to get real near me the rest of the night.

last night i saw mo, available, as am i for the first time since ever.  

i know that there is a mutual attraction, but i'm thinking that she doesn't really want me around more than just a sex buddy.  i would definately enjoy doin it, i know this, i almost went crazy last night because i was massaging madison, and switched up to mo. then they got naked and i was massaging ass and titties, arg.....

i was joking about doin it and she was talkin about liking to, but it came time for me to go to work. i really hate graveyard shifts. 

she said that she'd go to the movies with richie, madi, and i when we went this week.  goddamnnit, i can't say i've really been excited to go to the movies with a girl in a really long time. 

oh yeah!!!   i'm going to move into my new townhouse, on or before NOV. 1  

if you have really read this far, and think that you would be interested in the inaugural party, all you have to do is ask buddy.

richie is going to be my roommate.  its 1550 sq ft, bedrooms upstairs, huge living room, walk through kitchen, fireplace... we've got more than enough furniture, we're working on getting a 60' TV... and i'm gonna hook up a sex swing, heh, i'm excited."

i went to ashton's birthday party, and met some of his other friends for the first time. including his girlfriend, who couldn't seem to keep her eyes off me. at this point i have been feeling the least attractive of my entire life, but for some reason she was fucking drawn to me i could see it plainly. 

the next fucking day we went to his house and the stupid bitch had left a break-up letter in his room.  she was still there and when i left the room alone it was like she thought that i would join her little scheme. 

goddamnit, if i haven't learned to keep away from girls like that, i haven't learned anything from whats happened.

"event","i could be one to say that life is not fair, however, there are many signs that i have ignored because of my stubborn personality.  the things that i desire i want to come to me, and the things i put effort towards are nothing but detrimental, dangerous, and flat out wrong.

i can say without even considering the validity of my torn feelings, that it is true i had more chances than i can count to change the course of the present, obvious signs that my life was turning downhill again.  

i should be thankful that i am still alive.  i should realize that my problems are impossible to fix. i should understand that my problems are really only lessons in life, and i should move on from this shallow, and depressing situation.

i can't believe how much of my life revolved around her, i dove in thinking that the water would be cool and refreshing, only to get sucked into a tremendous whirlpool.  why, now, is it that no matter what i try she can't understand my feelings?  i can barely remember being so naive.  is it possible that in the future she will look back and feel remorse for the things she did to me?  i don't know, i think it is entirely possible she has already forgotten, and i am going to be forever regretful for letting her do the things she did to me.

never have i let anyone walk on me for so long, with such big fucking shoes.

annie thinks that she is now in love with chad.. i would call him more of an aquaintence than a friend, but that is how he has always been, the distant asshole. i've known him for years. i don't know why i didn't suspect that my best friend's ex girlfriend would create this triangle. maybe it was denial.  i remember telling myself to hang on as long as i could, enjoy the time i had, then be done with it. but even now i can't stop feeling the way i do.  i only hope that one day i will find a real, mutual, desireable relationship with someone.

so chad's girlfriend madison, (who was the one keeping annie away from him) took a holiday at the perfect time for annie to sink her claws into the game.  unfortunately, chad thinks that its cool to take on both girls, for whatever reason, they both deny the fact that he was just weighing his options. i don't know if it makes it harder for me... but when it was obvious that he was with madi, annie took her revenge by sleeping with me... after a month of hardly speaking. it was a terrible decision, but the best sex i've ever had.  at the time i believed it to be a gift from god. a final dance with my sweetest desire. even later, when i ran away from everyone, i was walking down a street, and she tried calling me... suddenly before i answered sirens rang out from every direction so loud that i had to reject her call.  god told me that it was really over, and warned me not to get involved any further. somehow it wasn't possible for me to give up, i thought i needed her.  but i don't possibly need to be treated like that. 

i somehow think that i forced chad to decide to stick with annie, when madi made moves towards me i couldn't possibly take the triangle gaining another side, i was too emotional.. so i told chad what she did and probably from that, or other things that i said and did he blew madi off, and took annie in. just two days ago madi was talking about how she would like to fuck me... good god, i couldn't even comprehend it.  i can't find any females attractive, (especially one already involved) i'm so hung up.  i definately didn't want madi, not because of how it would be switching ho's with chad... not because she's horribly inattractive, or not because she's someone i wouldn't like... theres just too many things going on.  she's in need, sure, and so am i. but she also knows that i am the number one guy that could maybe be considered revenge for whats happened, she could hurt annie and chad by getting involved with me.  richie is the number one reason i couldn't bring myself to do it, second to the fact that she would use me like annie.  i can tell that richie is in love with her.  she isn't keen to the thought of changing her friendship with him, but me coming between them would probably be more wrong than me taking annie from him.

richie told me all along to get rid of annie.  he knew what she was, and how she acted before i ever knew anything about her.  i didn't realize through the summer that she wasn't happy, i thought i had brought her something special.  but she said that the whole time she was bored, and wanting to get back into drugs.  i never knew that right before we started hanging out that she was addicted to meth. i had convinced myself that it was right, when it was so horribly wrong.  chad is a crackhead, annie taking one step his direction was enough for her to resume her crappy life, give up all the chances i gave her, and just fuck off the future.  even if it wasn't a future with me, i wish with all my heart that it wasn't a future with chad.

i hope that soon he will get sick of babysitting her, i know from experience that she is a lot of stress and effort.  i don't think that he will want to continue... but i know how addicting her personality is, and how well they get along, doing all kinds of crack.

i wanted to die.  i wanted to turn myself into the police, tell them that i raped a young girl, tell them that i gave her meth as incentive to forget the world, to lure her into my life.  i don't know what is going to happen in the next few months.  i got away from her completely, i couldn't keep doing it to myself.  i broke down when i realized what i had been doing.  that shit does that to you... you forget who you are, what you are doing, its miserable. she still says she wishes that i would still be her friend, that things could be the way they were, when i was taking care of her... but not in any sort of relationship... just one way.. i give, she takes.  i can't be around her. i want to so badly, but i'm not a crackhead, i just did what i thought would bring her to me? i don't have a logical excuse. i was only hurting myself.  i can't hang with that crowd.  i can't witness someone i care for so much throw her life away.  i can't help her either, she doesn't want my help, she wants chad and everything that comes with him, including the crack.  the entire summer, through everything i did for her, i never saw her so happy then about a month ago... well into this situation, when she found a bag of meth, and it meant that she would continue to satisfy her physical and emotional dependency.

i wish i could cry.. i seem to have forgotten how, its been so long.. i can still remember the last time i did.. ironically it was because of my own ignorance that the last major relationship in my life was ruined, and this time it is still because of my ignorance, but in a completely different way... before it was my lack of effort, direction, and personality... this time it is because i tried entirely too hard. it wasn't meant to be. my happiness lies in myself. if i am alone, no one but myself can cause me pain.

before i wished the future would bring be back to the ""good old days"" and now i wish the same, but i don't think that it is possible.  she is a lost cause.  she may as well have died.  i may has well have died. i probably did, when i lost my will to succeed in life, when i turned down a path that led me away from myself... i sacfificed my happiness, all because i'm a fool in love with the devil."

"event","i want to have a better understanding of tantra.  its a very cool thing; being able to have a four hour orgasm, but an even better thing being able to decide that you're going to make one happen on purpose.

the weird thing is that the both of us had no idea what the circumstances were that caused it.  she thought that maybe i had somehow slipped her some ecstacy, but it was super-potent, and only physically altering.  i said that i put a magic spell on her, but that wouldn't explain why i was also experiencing the same thing, or why specifically we had the most incredible climaxes at the same exact time. its strange, she had decided that i wasn't the one that she wanted to be with, but after that she doens't know if she's in love with me.

i was thinking that it was probably the fact that i had been having pretty frequent sex, then didn't even have an erection for over a month, i don't get turned on by anything miniscule.  i'm used to being around tons of pornography, and it doesn't do anything for me anymore. i really only become intrested anymore by serious effort, not random thoughts, or whatever the hell it is that used to cause it... i was kinda being teased for two days <u>straight</u>, no sleep, it really had given me a huge desire to make what happened real.. which would explain why i was capable of making the experience on my end, but what would make my desire turn her into a reciepient?

honestly, i want to know why.  fuck it, i'll go through the effort of not having frequent sex if i could have a monthly orgasm that lasted as long as that one; it was the entire session, and unlike anything i ever believed was capable of being achieved with or without drugs. it was absolutely incredible.  i want to know. i need to know. i don't understand."

i definately need money, i fucking owe people.. and its making me insane that if people that owe <i>me</i> money paid me back i wouldn't have any problem.  nick stole my new shoes. he made it sound as if he wanted to wear them for a date or something, then just didn't give them back.  i only wore them like twice... it was the only new pair of shoes i've gotten in about a year, and he should have given me the $50 for them, but instead took off out of town with them.  brian said he would pay me back in ONE goddamn day, and its been almost two months since i loaned him $75.  chris and andrew both owe me $20, and my sister owes me $25. 

i really fucking hate money.

i really don't like the fact that my relationship with annie is so leisure, i try to do everything i can for her, but she'll still complain about how her life stinks, and that she wishes she could move away and start off new. thanks annie, i'm glad you apperciate me so much.

i should be my parents accountant, because they are so dumb with money too..  they should be able to help me out, get my car fixed and all, but are totally in debt just because they choose to spend all their money by credit, and not even consolidate their bills. they've got like 30 different bills every month, and only my dad has a job.

she said i don't care, but that couldn't be further from the truth, i care, and thats the reason i'm upset.  She doesn't give a fuck, and would still have sex with me and the rest of the crew only if i was down.  i could handle it for a minute, but when Matty moved to Europe, that left Chad open for game.  

god damn, she even fucking told me that he's got priority over me, after everything that i had done for her.  i babysat her bitchass.  i tried to tell her not to drink so much, and to get her to go to school, but i still ended up getting her from people's houses during school, or fucking holding her head up while shes too drunk to even know whats going on.

so after waiting outside for richie for a little while, nick started getting a little more angry and i told him that he wasn't going to be able to get richie, he's staying inside, but if it would make him feel better he could box me.  he probably would have, but thankfully he decided it wouldn't make him feel better since i'm on his good side, and had nothing to do with it. so for some reason he decided that richie really wasn't coming out as long as he was standing by the door, and took off... but only to drive around the parking lot.. we were lucky enough to hop in the car fast enough to get out of there

heh, i dropped richie off at the minit mart on grand, then took annie home... nick was there, hoping to catch richie

its too bad there are so many people that would like to give or see richie get a good beating, it causes crazy situations.

haha, i think its funny because nick fuckin saw annie hangin out with richie the other night they ditched me and i was pissed off.  but to be honest i don't want to see that happen, i can't really jump in to stop nick, but i can't watch my friend get his face curbstomped either... bad situation"

"event","i have to ask annie today if she's had sex with anyone but me recently, i honestly don't know, i suspect that she has, but the other night she said that she hadn't... then we had wild scandalous sex.  i really shouldn't have done it. i don't know how it happened, i was completly drunk and had 5 drinks before i opened my half case.

if that isn't bad enough we were at richies house, on his couch, while everyone else was sleeping.. i fuckin thought that they were gonna come upstairs and see.

shit i am retarded, i bet she's been with a couple other guys at least, and i'm totally being used by a dirty ho... i hope she'll be honest when i ask her about it.. it'll make me feel a lot better."

"event","well i won't have to feel like a fool for much longer.  Annie is back with Richie, and i'm now free of responsibility.  i don't know how it was so easy for her to take advantage of my friendship, she doesn't even seem to understand, i tried to explain that she wasn't being a good friend, and she just turned around and said that i'm not always right... as if i had been making false claims the whole time.

well, maybe i've learned. hopefully i've learned... richie hasn't, he's back into it full power. its kind of ironic, he's gotten natalie pregnant, broken up with misha because ""he can't handle the responsibility of a girlfriend,"" but at the same time came through my life and swooped up annie.  ha, i guess i owe him thanks, because with all his problems, he's managed to solve mine.

Travis called me from somewhere and was saying that his friend gave me a bunch of pills at the rave and i straight jacked them, and i definately didn't do that, but if they're missin a grip of cash and shit, i don't want to be responsible, i don't know those fools, and i wasn't trying to pull anything.

i need a job desperately, so i can save enough money to get the fuck out of vancouver

i wish my parents hadn't taken my money, i wouldn't even be here now, and i'd never have gotten involoved with some of this shit thats happening."

"event","USC 8 is coming up really soon and i'm still worried about what i'm going to do, i've got tickets, a car, and a hotel.. everything is planned out for it to work out well, except for what i'm going to do about annie.

those days that i feel i'd be better of dead are because of her, and also the best days are because of her.  i think i'd be better off not wasting my time, but i'm so drawn to her.  she'll call me and no matter what i say i end up on my way to her house to pick her up.  she's using me for everything i've got and i don't even do anything to protect myself.

it really made me mad when i told nick about what was going on and he told me that i should stop talking to her, and i'd be better off.. then he kept her up all night talking to her, or she was talking to him, some bullshit, i don't even know who i should be mad at.. probably myself for even getting involved, i should know better, especially because of where she comes from, and how much i already knew.

i might end up selling her ticket, and breaking off our non-existant relationship, but it would be really mean of me to just tell her shes no longer invited.  its even worse than that because i've bought her a dress to wear, and a flower halo, but she makes me feel like shit, and i don't get any apperciation for the things ive done.

i've nearly got enough money now to fix my car, i've got to get it on the road. after its running i'll be able to put all my money into a ""save erick"" fund, where i'll raise money to move down to florida, then i'll be away from all the shit thats constantly making me miserable. i guess theres hope for my happiness.

heres to the alcohol that keeps me alive for the meantime."

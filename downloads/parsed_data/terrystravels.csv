"event","Today my uncle had arranged for me to talk to a I.T. guy from Unisys about what sort of qualifications I would need to get a I.T. job out here - if come back on a working holiday visa.  My uncle is a builder and in charge of building the Perth Convention Centre at the moment, I had to get into a building site basically and I wasn't wearing proper shoes - so I really shouldn't be on a building site, but with him being the boss, I got in ok! Spoke to the I.T guy there, gave me some good advice.

Back at uncle's later on I said my goodbyes as I was leaving early in the morning for my flights to Sydney. It was great to see them and they made me so welcome.

In the evening back at Paul and Siska's we went for an evening beach walk - it was great, I wasn't expecting much before getting there, but it was great!  Good way to end my time in Perth."

Kept me cool too!

In the evening we had another BBQ at my uncle's before heading back to Paul and Siska's."

"event","we went to Fremantle which is about 45 mins drive from Perth.  After visiting the local market, we had lunch - Fish and Chips! I had Shark!! It was really nice actually! Afterwards we paid a visit to the maritime museum, then to Fremantle prison.  I really enjoyed Fremantle Prison, better than Robben Island prison tour in S.Africa, The tour was too rushed at Robben Island, here you weren't rushed and it was so much more informative. 

On the way back to Paul's house we stopped off at Kings Park in Perth.  I really enjoyed it here, the view of the Perth skyline from here is amazing!

In the evening I went out on Paul's birthday night out!  Paul and Siska's friends were there too - they were all really nice.  We went to an area of Perth called Subiaco, it was a really good night!"

Its a 45 minute ferry ride there, and after breakfast on the island we hired bikes and went to Henrietta Rocks, this area of the island has a few shipwrecks there and when Tony was here last year he loved the place!  Paul tried to call him on his mobile from here to make him jealous, but knowing it was about 3am back home I knew he wouldn't answer!  Afterwards we went to the other side of the island, to a place known as 'The Basin' - which is basically a natural swimming pool! Here I atempted snorkelling for the first time, and..... I REALLY enjoyed it! It was so good! Got some great views of fish, especially one that went past my face - about 2cm away!  Then a couple of hours later we headed back to Perth on the Ferry.  The island is really nice, and we picked a great day to go as it was 40 degrees and perfect conditions! (The day after was overcast)."

"event","Below is the story of my mammoth journey from P.E, S.Africa to Perth, OZ.

Got up at 5am to prepare for flight, shared a taxi with two girls from the hostel who were also catching the same flight to Jo'burg.

Only took 5 mins to get to the airport! so we were waiting a while in the airport after checking in!

First flight was about 1 hour 30 mins, it was ok, then got to Jo'burg, it was a bit of a trek to change from domestic to international terminals, and then when I got there I sat around for 7 hours 'airside' waiting for my next flight....

Time comes and I board the flight, also boarding are the South African Cricket team! Then the weather changes and thunderstorms keep us on the tarmac for 2 hours, it was still quite bad when we finally took off, but it must have been safe with the cricket team on board too! Then during this 12 hour flight I was wondering whether I would catch my connecting third flight to Perth, it was going to be a very close thing.

Got to Sydney and had to clear Immigration then pick up my luggage and go to the domestic terminal! It was still a very close run thing, It was leaving from Gate 8 - right at the end of the terminal, so I ran and got there about 3 mins before the gate closed, phew! Got on the plane and the hard work was done, I was so tired at this point but still couldn't sleep.  5 hours later and the plane lands, I am so excited at this point as I have finally ended my mammoth journey and finally in Australia (main bit of my trip) and I had relatives waiting for me!

In total, I was up for 42 hours."

Mostly saw Elephants at the park, got within 2 metres of some, it was amazing, took some great photos too! Saw antelopes, warthogs, ostrichs, and right at the end saw a rhino - only the second time bradley our guide has seen a rhino there in 3 years of doing the tour! I was very lucky!

Great day and great way to end my trip in South Africa, off to OZ tomorrow - well start my journey!"

Lucy, Lorna and me walked down to the beach front and took a walk around the area this morning, then stopped for lunch before having to head back to the hostel, I had laundry to do, had to be done today because tomorrow I am off to Addo Elephant Park and Saturday I fly out to Oz, can't turn up to meet my relatives in manky clothes!

Went the casino tonight with the girls, its at a place called 'The Boardwalk' - very nice entertainment complex.  I lost R100 at the casino which isn't much, I had a good time anyway, the girls lost about the same amount too. It was fun, good atmosphere there. Said farewell to the girls as they were catching the Baz Bus early in the morning, so meeting them again somewhere in OZ."

Anyway conditions were perfect on Saturday afternoon, so we went up there, cable car revolves, which is very strange, my ears 'popped' as well which was freaky.  We walked around the top of table mountain for about an hour and a half, it was superb, no actuallly, there is no word to describe how good the view is!!!  We ended up staying up there for about another hour having a beer and chatting, was wierd being above some of the cloud, definitely the highlight of my trip so far. :-D"

"event","Friday (23rd), and my plan was to go up Table Mountain in the morning and Robben Island in the afternoon.

I went up to the cable station only to find it closed due to high winds!!! I wasn't going to walk up (I had considered it before arriving here, but when you see how big it is.... no chance!) so I decided to go straight to the Waterfront to try and see Robben Island.

Got there about 11:30am, booked my ticket for the ferry, it wasn't leaving til 2:30pm so I had a bit of a wait! The waterfront can keep you entertained for a while though, so it wasn't that bad.

2:30pm came and on the ferry, took about 30 mins to get there, then we were put on buses and driven around the island.  We stopped off at one place, which has the most superb view of Cape Town with Table Mountain in the background.  I am looking forward to getting those photos back!

Then we were taken to the Prison, here I didn't really think it was appropriate to take many photos here, I had a strange feeling inside me, I can't explain it.  Our guide around the prison was a former prisoner, so it was really interesting to hear what it was like from someone who had actually experienced it.  We got rushed through the section where nelson mandela's cell was, which was a bit of a disappointment, we just walked down the corridor really, couldn't stop due to time running out.

But I'm glad I went, was a 'good' day.

Got back to hostel and in the bar got chatting to a girl called Gemma who is in a similar situation as me, travelling alone, etc.  Was good to chat to someone in a very similar situation, at first we thought we were both on the same plane coming to Cape Town, but she made a mistake and she came on the flight a day later!

We travelled down the west coast of the peninsula first, stopping off at a few places on the way, then at lunchtime we arrived at the Cape Of Good Hope National Park.  Then the bus stopped so we could get out, unload the mountain bikes and we all went on a 10 Km bike ride.  It was really good doing the ride, because its better than being stuck in the bus all day! The last uphill part was a killer though! - and the tour guide said most of the run was downhill!! - yeah right!

Then we had a picnic lunch, got chatting to an english guy called Charles and an Aussie guy called Andrew about Football, found out they were both Liverpool Fans, so we had a good chat about that for a while!

Then we made our way back on the bus to Cape Point, Beware of the Baboons! If they see you eating food of drinking they will come and attack you!  When we were there a baboon swiped a bottle of coke from a girl in the car park and ran off!

We all walked up to Cape Point, well worth it as the view was amazing.  Then after walking back down we all decided to walk up to the cape of good hope, this was a harder walk as there was no defined path, so this was more tricky, one of the girls from the uk called Nikita was worried about being attacked by a baboon so she stuck with me on the way up. Then when walking down we all battled to get our photos taken next to the cape of good hope sign, as we got there though 2 bus loads of japanese tourists arrived, I thought I would have to move all my future flights forward a few months  as it looked like we would be waiting for a while, but we kind of pushed in the queue and louise our guide had 8 cameras around her neck trying to take our photos, while at the same time the japanese group are booing us because there are 8 photos to take! It was so funny!

On way back to Cape Town, we stopped off at Simon's Town to see the Penguins, They were cool, got some great photos, hope they turn out ok!

So end of trip and I had a great day, made a few friends, I might be going up Table Mountain tomorrow with a girl from Canada called Nicole who was on the tour, so at least I don't have to go on my own!

When I got back to hostel, I met the new person in the dorm, a german guy called Chris, seems like a bit of a hippy - asked if I wanted to play chess with him, he likes to play it with the ocean around him apparently, bit wierd, but he seems ok!

Went to the hostel bar in the evening, talking to the wierd german and got talking to a few others staying there. So was a good day!"

The vision that is sold
Just never seems to grow
The life that you cannot mold

The fact is played, the story's old,
I'm f**king cold
To be like you and have your actions
To buy into the new perceptions
Of how my life should be, the vision I
Should see

So it will dry your tears away. Maybe calm your mind.
Set your mind on something outside the solid walls and strong bars you sit behind.

I look into your eyes, I do not see you in that room where you sit each day. Writing and drawing your fears away. When I look into your eyes I see a child trying to find your way.

You are a child that is lost, Lost in the world where adluts live.
You are a little girl lost by the swings that you love to play on so much.
You will find your way, through the time you lost and the fears you have. You will see that life can become a life that you want to love with stragth and the will."

Give dreams where love will be

"event","<P>To day I saw a girl I really like cry...I wanted to hold her and tell her that every thing is goin to get better I wanted to just be there for her but I didnt get to do that I had to once again refrain b-cuz she I dont know she says&nbsp;she likes me and&nbsp;I know she wants to be with me but she thinks she will hurt me,&nbsp;mabey she will but I am willing to take that&nbsp;chance I am willing. I really like her and&nbsp;she is just the nices person ever but I just have to sit back and watch her cry and be in pain and that&nbsp;kills me cuz she should be happy&nbsp;no one should have to be put through shit and I hope&nbsp;those people have other&nbsp;people. She has me, she does I will never leave and I hope she doesnt leave me, I hope to god!</P>
<P>Have you ever had the feeling of want. Where if&nbsp;you look at a certain person you just want to take them by the hand and run away with them far far&nbsp;away so no one can see you or hear you so no one can bother you so you and the certain&nbsp;person can forget and school, family, friends and the world and just sit with that person and just fall in there eyes and never come back.Have you ever had that feeling of longing.&nbsp;Well, I&nbsp;feel that now!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways...</P>

I can't stop thinking about... someone. What do you do when you think about someone so much, and can't figure them out, and it distracts you from daily life? DO TELL.

I want to be back in Utah. There was no trouble there, nothing to worry about. I just got to do what I love 7 days a week in the company of people who are just as passionate about the arts as I am. I didn't fight with my mother very often, no one was telling me what to do, who I can see, when I can do this or that.... meh. I was happy there. I sound so horrible....

I didn't get the role of Anne Frank. So what... life goes on

I must be going, I've got French to study.

I can't get you outta my head.....

Auditions, auditions, auditions. They don't stop coming! Don't get me wrong, I like auditioning, but there are just so many, so soon after I'm home. I really don't feel like writing about how insane I am at the moment, so I'm going to try and put some pics up.

CRAP

 I thought I knew how, HAH!

What to say?

Where shall I start?

Well, I just got done with opening week. It's been a very, veeryyy long week. My opening night was fantastic. Really, really great. Julia was there! We got to talk beforehand too, so that was good. The whole show ran smoothly, if you forget the part where my jumprope got stuck in a tree on the set....and I tried to run off with it....>.<
I got a lot of laughs on my lines, which made me very happy. When an audience laughs at something I say, it makes my day.
I got a standing ovation, and a fantastic review in the Salt Lake Tribune. Yay!

Anywho, I just got home from a bike ride with Kevin, who plays Dickon. It was SO hot...miserably hot, but still, it was fun. Not too much dirt. hehe

I'm on day 4 of 6 days inbetween opening night and my next show, which is Wednesday night. I can't believe I've made it this far without knocking myself over the head.....the town closes at like nine! Jeez.....

Well, I've become a superstar in Logan. I'm serious! I get stopped on the street, in bakeries, supermarkets, and just about everywhere else. I've started tucking my ID badge inside my shirt and wearing sunglasses indoors....just foreshadowing as what is to come....
And don't you DARE laugh at that!

I'm gonna be a star....

Just
You
Wait."

"event","I know, I know. I haven't updated this thing or my Xanga in oh so long. Sorry! I'm just the slightest bit busy up here. :-P
Rehearsal is going very well, I'm really happy. The company is absolutely spectacular. More about that later.

The weather is crazy. It was 85 degrees yesterday, then last night around 5 it got all cloudy, then a major thunderstorm started at around 10. Me being the spoiled Cali girl that I am, I haven't been in a thunderstorm since I was about 4. No joke. So I kept trying to tell my mother that the loud booming sounds we were hearing were jetplanes. Ha! Then I was lying in bed around midnight, almost asleep, when I heard a deafening BOOM. I shot straight up in bed. Then lightning flashed across the sky. Omg it freaked me out! I woke up this morning to a view of snow on the mountains out my bedroom window. It was....odd. Snow? in JUNE? I dunno....

What else, what else? Oh yes. I love how my friends care about me so much that they're written me everyday! (NOT) Not a single piece of mail in my mailbox! I love you too.

Ummm....ah yes. One more thing. Guys suck. They absolutely suck. I despise the male species. Okay, not ALL of you.....phhh

Off to listen to The Beatles......"

I'm tired of xanga, so I decided to post in my LJ, which I have NEVER used. Anywho, what to say, what to say? Alrighty, I'll start out with my voice recital. The first night went quite well. Nothing much to say about it. I know that duet inside and out so I was pretty calm. I guess I made up for it on Thursday night because I woke up THAT MORNING a nervous wreck. I sang ""I'm not Afraid of Anyhing"" from Songs For A New World - Jason Robert Brown, Brilliant, brilliant man. Anywho, after having to sit through 22 songs before me, (JOY!) I got up on the stage and realized I had been holding my breath....greattt. I got a hold of myself and nodded to the accompanist to start. I heard the first chord of the music and I was lost. Amazing how a song can do that....I (finally!) got to the end, ""afraaaaaaaaaaiddd"". It took me a second to snap out of it and realize that the song was over. I'm so happy it went well. 

Oh yeah, The Acorn ran the story on me on Thursday. Check it out @ http://www.theacorn.com and click on community. 

My aunt will be here any minute and I have to call David before she's here.

Loves"

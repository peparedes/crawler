This was a model named Joyce. I was hesitant about drawing her becauce we were in like 3 other classes together, but all in all, she ended up being one of the more fun and challenging people to draw. 

The second picture is a bit off of the main objective, but the pose she'd been placed in was a ""corpse position"". Being that this was around April after I lost my Tanya and the boys, I just couldn't draw her that way... so I made her a mermaid.

"event","Platinum on her finger, jewels on her neck, and the finest prison anyone could ever live in. It was all anyone could ever have wanted; it was all she thought she could ever want, and yet there was emptiness. She could scream for hours, but the house was so big no one would hear. It was enough to drive one mad. Was it the madness that drove her out a window, or the abscence of love?"

<b>Retreat:</b> She closed her eyes and kissed away the world, retreating into a place that only she could see. A place that exsisted only in her mind, but was more real to her than anything else. It was the perfect place, where the evils of man did not exsist and darkness hadn't yet set in its roots.

"event","Life like chess is a game. We're all pieces, each assigned to our roles, never deviating, but always observant. What would happen, I wonder if the pieces were to suddenly decide to move on their on? Would they continually follow in the path they were told to move, because it's comfortable? Or would they blaze a new trail, and create a new way to move? What would you do?"

Scribed by another female's hand. If only she'd witheld her heart, then perhaps she would have spared him his. One bullet left, then darkness."

Some people I guess tend to forget that it happened, and that it's still happening. They're comfortable in the bubble they've created for themselves. Or maybe they haven't forgotten, maybe they're just afraid if they stepped outside, that natural selection would kick their ass. It probably would."

I often wonder if it ran because it cried, living its life slowly but surely ignored. Never seen, but seen through. What would it  be like to be an invisible object? Never loved for what you are, but for what others see through you. ...Bittersweet."

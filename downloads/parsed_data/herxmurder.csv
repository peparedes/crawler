"event","<center>[Woman:] ""Father is it possible to grant forgiveness for a sinful action to be committed?""

[Father:] ""My daughter, you would have to question whether or not the said-sin is necessary.""

[Woman:]
""(Absolutely...) to wash away indecency, re-write who we are.
Weeding out societies weakest in attempts to cure,
the disease which we are fed forcefully down our throats.
I seek absolution for these sins unwritten.
Any who stand in my way, shall be subjected to torn ligaments and limbs ripped from their sockets.
For no pity shall be handed down to the feeble.
Human nature seals our fates by leading us down a path of destruction.
I have just merely sped up the process.""

[Father:] ""Daughter? Why are you explaining all this to me?""

[Woman:]
""Well I never had much use for religion.
I merely needed someone to listen.""</center>"

"event","""Representative appointments are sought from 3 motives. 1. ambition 2. personal interest. 3. public good. Unhappily the two first are proved by experience to be most prevalent. Hence the candidates who feel them, particularly, the second, are most industrious, and most successful in pursuing their object: and forming often a majority in the legislative Councils, with interested views, contrary to the interest, and views, of their Constituents, join in a perfidious sacrifice of the latter to the former. A succeeding election it might be supposed, would displace the offenders, and repair the mischief. But how easily are base and selfish measures, masked by pretexts of public good and apparent expediency? How frequently will a repetition of the same arts and industry which succeeded in the first instance, again prevail on the unwary to misplace their confidence?

How frequently too will the honest but unenlightened representative be the dupe of a favorite leader, veiling his selfish views under the professions of public good, and varnishing his sophistical arguments with the glowing colours of popular eloquence?"" - James Madison"

"event","We're a month into 2011 so I guess it's a pretty good time to evaluate things. I'm trying to stick to my resolutions for once, so there's been a lot of changes.

Firstly, I'm much better at driving than I used to be. Early in the month I drove up Adam to Mitsuwa, which I'd been paranoid of doing before. So that's out of the way. I don't think there will be any more issues with driving from now on.

Secondly, I'm pretty well maintaining my weight. Thanks to the constant blizzarding, the last week and a half or so has kind of knocked me off balance since I have nothing to do but sit around and eat, but I'll get that back under control soon enough. Still have to work on cutting body fat though. As of this writing I'm at ~160 lbs.

Thirdly, the facial hair is all gone and I think I've totally come around to it. I think it's better with a little stubble but as of now I'll probably be staying on the shaven side of things. I wish I'd realized this about a year ago; however, I'm actually glad I didn't shave prior to losing weight, because my face had absolutely no definition and was just a big bowl of pudge. So it would've looked very babyish.

Fourthly, I've started wearing long pants. Blame the snow again. Still no jeans. Won't wear jeans.

Fifthly, I'm losing interest in school. I guess this is partly senioritis, but more importantly I just don't see the point anymore. If I keep up my current grades I'll graduate summa cum laude - woohoo, how wonderful. A meaningless title. If I had wanted to go to grad school this would be excellent, but I don't, so it means nothing. I really have no desire to write this thesis, or go to classes, or do anything academic these days. I don't know how I kept up such a gung ho attitude for so long.

Sixthly, I'm pursuing these two girls and I have no idea how it's going so I'll get back to you/me on that next month.

Seventhly, I'm finding it hard to study Japanese without deadlines.

Eighthly, I've been watching a lot of Star Wars these days. What's up with that?

Ninethly, I hope that Egyptian revolution works out. Let's see if it's still going on the day after I post this!

Tenthly, /soc/ is a good board as of now. Lots of encouragement. I never thought I'd want to thank that site.

Eleventhly, I'm tired."

"event","""Consider the great courage and solidarity we've seen in Egypt today. The dignity and selflessness it took for ordinary citizens to risk death, maiming, torture, or ""disappearance"" to stand up for their rights. Then look to America, where we are willfully ignorant and utterly unwilling to use our functioning political system in order to fix our problems without having to risk death or injury. It's deeply shameful.

Honestly, if an organized mass movement of people started demanding reform and would ruthlessly vote out of office those who opposed it, even US politicians would swiftly fall in line. After all, these are not principled individuals, nor are they even stiff-necked aristocratic dictators. They are craven, hunchbacked bootlickers used to fellating their corporate masters in exchange for golf trips. The lack of reform in America is a question of will and ideology. This is the strength of American power - unlike less sophisticated systems that rely on crude secret police states, we've created a system where we police ourselves and we like it. We have hired one bourgeois to alienate another.

Egyptians know what they're fighting for: justice, jobs, and personal freedom. They know the current regime isn't working, they've educated themselves, and they're working together, making personal sacrifices to get it. Is it really so strange that Americans are filled with anger and shame when they see what's going on over there and then look back home?"""

"event","""This is a very sad thing, but it started in the 1960s with the Civil Rights movement and the integration of public schools. Poor whites, especially in the south and midwest, who had traditionally voted Democrat against the Rich and lived with the pride of 'we may be poor and uneducated, but at least we're not black' suddenly didn't have that anymore. They felt betrayed by the Democrats and didn't have anybody to cling to.

That's where Nixon's Southern Strategy came in and was the first time that the Republican Party allied itself with Conservative Christian Values. Specifically they started appealing to ignorance. They preached that it was okay to be stupid and anybody who said different was an elitist. When the Republicans tapped into this, they were able to make inroads into previously inaccessible territory and since then, they have focused exclusively on 'The way things ought to be'.

This post-integration period saw increasing attendance at newly formed Conservative Evangelical Schools that catered primarily to poor whites. These schools have tied authority and religion together in a way that had been impossible before. The ""Prosperity Gospel"", which I understand is practically unheard of in Europe, ties in Prosperity as the result of hard work and blind faith in God. Because of nearly 40 years of this kind of teaching in private schools, for large sections of the country, the concept of riches and blessings are synonymous and consequently, the rich must be saints, because God has blessed them so much. Hard Work and Personal Responsibility became the watch-words of the right, and anything that is seen as trying to avoid either (for example: Abortion, Contraception, Cures for STDs) is viewed as sinful and evil. Also anything that takes away God's blessings from the Rich (and lotto winners) is evil.

This, ""coincidentally"", is about the same time you start seeing an increase in the public perception of Unions as promoting rewards for being lazy, so literally the only place that the poor have left to congregate and join together at are their right-wing conservative Churches. Previously this had been the view of the Right (and actually led to the rise of ""The Family"", whose earliest members were involved in evangelizing to the rich and the leaders who could actually make a difference and not coincidentally, were also involved in Strike-Breaking activities in the 1930s), but it obviously didn't have traction with the working-class for the reason that's in their very name: They are the Working Class. You can't really tell them that they are lazy without introducing some kind of divider.

That divider came about with the introduction of the ""Lower Middle Class"" as a concept and it was into that class that everybody who sent their children to private (Christian) schools, and who could buy things (even on credit) were in. The Middle Class in America never really grew as a percentage of the population and isn't really shrinking. The percentage of people who are genuinely middle class is the same as it's always been, it's that in the 60s, the definition of middle class changed to include all of the labor that had previously been proud to be considered working class. (In the same sense that the number of College Graduates isn't really increasing. The number of people going to college has gone up (especially For-Profit schools, Trade Schools, and job-training institutions calling themselves colleges), but it's still only about 20% of the population that actually graduates from University. That's how high it's always been.)

With all those people suddenly in the ""middle class"", it was suddenly easier to demonize the working class as lazy, because all of those people who had been working class before had suddenly made it and were middle class. So there's your divider: The Lower Middle Class. (Of course, all these Middle Class Americans have also been taught that there isn't really any class divide in the US, despite our divides being deeper and sharper than any in modern Europe.)

This, also ""coincidentally"", is also about the same time that you start hearing people rail against knowledge and against science, because that would shake the foundations of the religious hold over these people. If the Bible isn't true, then everything they know about the world is wrong and their world-view doesn't work.

Also, it's about this same time that the popular notion that everybody has a voice and everybody has an opinion and all opinions are equally valid came about. To give strength to people who before would have simply said 'I don't know, so I'll leave it to people who do'. Now prior knowledge of a subject isn't a prerequisite for having a valid opinion on the matter.

So really, ultimately, it's all about about class warfare: The upper classes have successfully executed a divide and conquer strategy in order to protect themselves from the the ghost of communism. Basically, Fascism came to America wrapped in a cross and a flag and it suckered in 36% of the population."" - another very intelligent guy on SomethingAwful"

Western speech, as something that rarely has any effect on power, is, like badgers and birds, free. In states like China, there is pervasive censorship, because speech still has power and power is scared of it. We should always look at censorship as an economic signal that reveals the potential power of speech in that jurisdiction.

"event","Thanksgiving today. Another holiday where I have to spend the day with a bunch of hyper conservative relatives I dislike. Also there's a mouse in the wall somewhere in here. Woohoo.

This semester's pretty close to over, so I might as well evaluate it, even if it's just so I can look back on this post in however many months/years and see what I was thinking. I'm pretty bad with remembering things from the past distinctly, so I wish I'd kept a journal throughout highschool or something. I guess this sort of thing will have to do.

Thesis class was harder than I was expecting. The actual work for the class (the papers themselves etc) wasn't bad at all, but researching for this stupid project was probably the longest thing I've ever done for one paper. I've read at least 30 books and articles, and I still don't feel like that's anywhere near enough. Fortunately I've still got half a year to go before the paper has to be turned in. Note for future: that one kid is doing a paper on NJ punk rock subculture in the 80s/90s, and that is cool.

Byzantine Empire: Waaaaaay more difficult than the fall of Rome class or possibly even the Hellenistic period class, simply because it was so long, covering some thousand or so years. I'm impressed how I'm able to remember pretty much all the important information from Diocletian up to Michael VI Bringas. Let's see how long that will last. Really interesting stuff, too bad I'll never use any of it in my life again. I kind of want to tell somebody about all of this history though.

Japanese 302: Sociology done in Japanese. Was there any organization to this class at all? No. Big mess. At least I made some friends, although I'm sure since they're not from around here that's not going to last long after college. Oh yeah, and we watched Princess Mononoke, and that's also cool. And Bleach is bad.

Geology: Actually very interesting. Too bad my professor is a climate change denialist, because otherwise the class might actually be fun. That doesn't really surprise me too much; I wanted to be a scientist when I was a kid. I probably should have followed in that path to be honest, since at least that has job prospects.

Overall this has been a pretty weird semester. I've had to double down on homework, which I didn't even know I could do considering every semester I'm already bogged down. I wish I'd actually been able to have some semblance of a social life this semester, but unlike in high school where I just was lazy and wanted to play video games or was too shy, I actually couldn't do anything now because I have so much work to do. That's pretty disappointing, because I've been stuck in an introspective rut for the past half-year, and I think it's gearing me towards wanting to be more sociable. Not extroverted, but just not as much of a shut in as I am. At the same time, I'm a workaholic, and I actually get nervous and annoyed when I don't have a deadline hanging over me and a heavy workload to get done and a perfectly timed schedule whereby everything is maximally divvied up. So I don't think I'm going to run the risk of becoming some party animal. I wouldn't like that anyway. 

I've got too many books I want to read and too many movies I want to see. Still need to get around to reading some theological things. I think I'll have more free time to do what I want to/need to do after college is over. Of course, then I have to actually work permanently, and that's...probably not going to happen.

I think I sit around and romanticize to classical music too much.

On the plus side, at least I'm not a juggalo.

I am a big neurotic whiner and I purposefully make my LiveJournal posts more depressing to fit a theme (Facebook is politics, Tumblr is wacky pictures, LiveJournal is depressing because that's what LiveJournal is supposed to be). I'm aware these posts constantly make me out to be some sort of horribly depressed person with no redeeming features. That's just because I'm a moderately depressed person who thinks it's fun to post dreary things on LiveJournal; I save the eccentricities for the other sites.

I want to sit by a lake and talk to someone.

The end."

"event","If you ever wonder why liberals often don't show up at the polls on election day, it's very simple. Liberals view America as a country in constant flux, which can use the government to correct various injustices. Conservatives, meanwhile, tend to view American society as good enough as it is right now, and any incoming change is thus either scary or a threat to their current way of life and rights. And it's much easier to motivate people to come out and vote in favor of protecting something already there (think of how many people came out in favor of Prop 8, they were protecting the status quo) than to get people to come out and vote in favor of something not there, which has no guarantee of success. This results in all the whiny teenagers and 20-somethings who say ""Why vote, it doesn't matter and it doesn't change anything!!!""

Tying into my previous post, the best way to drive progress forward is to implement large and extensive programs at such a fast pace that once they become entrenched, people will come out and vote in favor of protecting them. If the Democrats would stop being idiots and start playing the rhetoric as ""Republicans want to take away your rights to x, y, z, come out and vote to protect your rights!"" they'd get a lot more done."

"event","If there's one thing above all that the past 20 years have shown me, it's that incrementalism does not work when there is a for-profit media that caters to specific audiences. The reason FDR and JFK and LBJ could push through liberal policies, and why European nations continue to function, is because they didn't/don't have Fox News and AM radio to deal with.

The only way to get progressive ideals enacted in American society going forward must be to blitzkrieg them through Congress at as fast a pace as possible and in as large an amount as possible, so that they become so ingrained and entrenched in the American psyche that they're near impossible to overturn. There's a reason why old people will vote for whoever refuses to cut Social Security and Medicare, after all, even though they're socialist programs."

"event","Let me just clarify what that last post means, because I realize something so vague probably means nothing to anyone who actually reads this LJ from time to time for whatever reason. I've always been rather indifferent to emotional things, or at least I've been good at projecting that sort of aloofness even when I was actually upset about something. Everyone does that to some extent, but since I'm naturally a cynical and sarcastic person it's fused into my general personality. To some extent, it really is true that I am indifferent to a lot of things that other people strive for in life, like wealth or love. To some extent, I'm also probably lying to myself.

What annoys/worries me is that whereas I used to be fully confident in my indifference, lately I've been feeling like I care. Anyone who's watched Seinfeld probably remembers that scene where Jerry started crying because he actually cared about a girlfriend (""What is this salty discharge!?"" ""This is horrible! I care!"" etc). I'm not at that level. But I don't like having to reevaluate what I care about and what I don't.

I'm pretty sure this is mostly because I'll be graduating in a year and that means I'll actually have to confront the world like an adult instead of someone locked into a very easy, annually repeating system that I've grown comfortable with. Except I feel like everyone else would have gone through their dumb ~*fInDiNg MySeLf*~ phases during high school and early college, but since I've always just sat there and looked at everyone else and went ""Heh, what a bunch of losers, worrying about their First World Problems while Real People have Real Problems around the world, like starving Africans or oppressed North Koreans"" and then patted my back and felt smug and superior about how I didn't have to deal with the garbage everyone else had to deal with, I never got to actually deal with the garbage everyone else had to deal with. It doesn't help that I've always also been extremely devoted to academics and that took up all of my thinking time.

In short I am actually human and that's annoying."

"event","""But the function of dress as an evidence of ability to pay does not end with simply showing that the wearer consumes valuable goods in excess of what is required for physical comfort. Simple conspicuous waste of goods is effective and gratifying as far as it goes; it is good prima facie evidence of pecuniary success, and consequently prima facie evidence of social worth. But dress has subtler and more far-reaching possibilities than this crude, first-hand evidence of wasteful consumption only. If, in addition to showing that the wearer can afford to consume freely and uneconomically, it can also be shown in the same stroke that he or she is not under the necessity of earning a livelihood, the evidence of social worth is enhanced in a very considerable degree. Our dress, therefore, in order to serve its purpose effectually, should not only be expensive, but it should also make plain to all observers that the wearer is not engaged in any kind of productive labor. In the evolutionary process by which our system of dress has been elaborated into its present admirably perfect adaptation to its purpose, this subsidiary line of evidence has received due attention. A detailed examination of what passes in popular apprehension for elegant apparel will show that it is contrived at every point to convey the impression that the wearer does not habitually put forth any useful effort. It goes without saying that no apparel can be considered elegant, or even decent, if it shows the effect of manual labor on the part of the wearer, in the way of soil or wear. The pleasing effect of neat and spotless garments is chiefly, if not altogether, due to their carrying the suggestion of leisure-exemption from personal contact with industrial processes of any kind. Much of the charm that invests the patent-leather shoe, the stainless linen, the lustrous cylindrical hat, and the walking-stick, which so greatly enhance the native dignity of a gentleman, comes of their pointedly suggesting that the wearer cannot when so attired bear a hand in any employment that is directly and immediately of any human use. Elegant dress serves its purpose of elegance not only in that it is expensive, but also because it is the insignia of leisure. It not only shows that the wearer is able to consume a relatively large value, but it argues at the same time that he consumes without producing."""

Who wakes up believing that there is no appreciation for our veterans and our armed forces and that without a noisy speech from Sarah Palin, their sacrifice would be scorned? It's not unfair to say that such grievances are purely and simply imaginary, which in turn leads one to ask what the real ones can be.

"event","A few updates

1. Work really did end up being pretty boring. But at least it paid well.  3 weeks to go.

2. I've had far too much to read for this thesis. Sorry random anonymous person who seems to care about me reading Augustine, but that got pushed off again. If you knew the amount of reading material I already have to do, you'd understand.

3. I'm pretty sure I don't want to go to grad school. I've heard literally nothing good about the prospects for history grad students. I even saw a site whose sole purpose was helping history grad students get jobs that had on its front page a link to an article explaining why you shouldn't go to grad school.  Here's some reasons I don't want to go.
-I like history a lot, but I don't really love it.  At least, not in the way that I would want to devote my entire life to it.  I don't have it within me to spend my life researching unimportant minutiae like what types of chickens Romans used for their augury.  All the really important things have been covered, written about to death for the past 200 years.  As it is now, it's only extremely academic things that don't really matter that are left.
-I don't care to put up with the internal politics of grad school and peer reviewing and all that.
-I can't really find a way to morally justify it. History is really one of the most elitist things out there.  I'm sitting here, locking myself in a room reading about things that happened thousands of year ago that have no real bearing on modern day problems, or learning dead languages that are dead for good reason, becoming more ""cultured"" by the minute while some guy is out there starving or being blown up in a warzone. If my focus had been on history within, say, the last 500 years, that would be worthwhile, because I could've gone and become some sort of historian/social activist or something, but that's not what I studied. And I can't really help it that my main interest lies in classical history. So my main interest lies in something pretty much worthless.  So why pursue it, rather than just read history books for my own pleasure like I watch tv?  Because I might get a professorial job with tenure?  I'd rather do something that at least benefits other people even if I have to suffer for it.
-On the other hand, I often find it hard to motivate myself to help people because we'll all be dead from global warming and peak oil soon anyway."

"event","Work is boring. It's been a week and I already want to be back in school.

More than that, I want my computer to unvirus itself so I can stop relying on this laptop. But most likely I'm going to have to wipe the memory and lose all my notes. Then again this gives me the chance to buy a new computer.

To whoever it is who takes interest in my reading habits: within the next week or two I should begin reading stuff for my thesis (first off the bat, I need to reread through Peter Green's massive Alexander to Actium) and as for church history/theology I think I'll probably go read some Augustine or Clement.  I've also been thinking about getting a copy of Young's Literal Translation, but it's a century and a half old so that seems a bit outdated. I've been using some website, whose address escapes me at the moment though, that has a rather literal translation of scripture instead of the more messed around/traditional stuff like KJV or NIV or RSV or what have you. It's not as dynamic but Hebrew is a rather turgid language, so you roll with what you've got. I'd rather see the real thing than go with what sounds better.

I'd also like to see a Bible that puts together all the different texts from the different branches. Protestants whittle it down so much in their search for ""pure"" canon, but everyone who has looked into textual criticism knows there's still a huge amount of suspect material in the canon, even in the NT. There's a reason the Church Fathers were conflicted over whether Revelation should be included. And we don't even know who wrote Hebrews - I saw a theory once that it was Priscilla! So I say let's just take it all; Esdras, Bel and the Dragon, Ethiopian Maccabees, whatever the Syrians have, toss it all together. It's not like the Bible is a consistent ""book"" anyway, it's an anthology of tons of different books in different genres by different authors with different audiences at different points of time. So let's see some more of that variety."

"event","Another good summary nabbed from a message board.

""Historically, U.S. immigration policy has run the gamut from ""who cares"" to ""we desperately need workers"" to ""get out foreign scum"" depending on its economic conditions.

Even as recently as 1942 we were inviting Mexican laborers into the United States. The areas with the highest immigration were historically owned by Mexico and when ownership transferred to the United States many, many families simply became Americans. The areas have a deep intertwining history of people movement.

In our modern, neoliberalized economy, capital and investment flows across borders with the lowest possible resistance. In this particular case, trade agreements like NAFTA and CAFTA allowed manufacturing to flow across the borders, employing cheaper developing-world labors at the cost of U.S. industry.

Historically, much of the economy northern Mexico and many central and south American nations were supported by their agricultural base. Like many undeveloped nations, agriculture (and to a lesser extent natural resource extraction like oil and mining) supported most of the population because industrialization had not fully transformed the nation.

The U.S. protects its agricultural industry against cheaper third-world food by dumping massive subsidies on its farmers. As a result, a corn cob from the United States is going to be pennies on the dollar in the world market compared to one grown in Mexico. Mexican farmers and peasants, finding themselves undercut on the world market and no longer able to conduct their centuries-old trade, find themselves in a precarious economic situation. They can:

A) Work in one of the maquiladora sweatshops, earning near-slave labor wages in dangerous, unregulated factory conditions. Many choose to do this.

B) Attempt to get a part of the plentiful amount of unskilled labor demand in the Southwestern United States, earning enough relative money to support their entire family.

Unsurprisingly, many of these unskilled laborers take their chances, risking life and limb and quite often relatively large financial stakes in order to make a living for themselves.

Now if you want to ask the question, ""how do we end illegal immigration,"" well it depends on your goals.

If your goal is white nationalism Americans First, you wouldn't really change anything. Illegal immigrants help your economy through their productivity and the taxes they pay and the current system is set up so that they go no legal rights or representation and they can be deported at any moment. You might build some walls or have some bizarre (and ineffective) checkpoints and other measures, because the harder you make it for the immigrants, the less secure they are and the less capable they are of fighting back.

If your goal is libertarian-style isolationism, then you would want to end the U.S. farm subsidies and free trade agreements that create this whole unbalanced situation. You would also want to actively prosecute and punish those who employ illegal immigrants simply because they can pay them less, which would be far more effective than building walls and repopulating minefields and predator drones or whatever. This would have the side effect of generally fucking over the immigrants, but hey, they were born on the wrong side of the line, right?

If your goal is equality and social justice, you would end border enforcement that punishes and kills civilian workers trying to cross while not effectively limiting their numbers, stop free trade agreements and agribusiness subsidies that so hurt the economy of the third world, and in the meantime provide the infrastructure necessary for the undocumented immigrants to gain documentation, political rights, and a level of security necessary to defend themselves against predatory employers and white nationalist xenophobes both in their home nations and within the United States.""

"event","I got bored and decided to make a list on how American high schools should be run since they seem to be failing and producing a largely ignorant population.  I'm sure whatever I would recommend would make teenagers hate me, but too bad.  It's for their own good.

Firstly, no standardized tests - they don't mean anything and they're a waste of time and money.  They constrain what teachers can teach, since they only teach to the test instead of teaching so you understand something.  So get rid of them.

Secondly, school hours - start it at 8:30, end at 4:30.  Kids don't want to be in school for 8 hours?  Too bad!  Don't have enough time for homework?  They do.  Sports programs have to get pushed back later? Big deal.  And while they're there for 8 hours, make them take an extra class. 5 classes, an hour and a half each, with a half hour lunch.  Take a couple minutes from each class for hallway time.

32 required classes and 8 electives (basically 4 required classes and 1 elective per semester).

REQUIRED CLASSES
HISTORY
-World History 1 (prehistory to 1500, and make sure it's not Eurocentric)
-World History 2 (1500 - present)
-US History 1 (up through civil war)
-US History 2 (to present)

MATH
-Geometry
-Algebra I
-Algebra II
-Trigonometry

SCIENCE
-Earth/Space
-Physics
-Biology
-Chemistry

English
-English 1
-English 2
-English 3
-English 4
-Classic Literature (ancient world classics [not just greek/roman mythology])
-Medieval Lit to Early Modern (from, say, Volsunga Saga/Beowulf to Shakespeare)
-American + English Lit
-World Lit

GYM
-4 gym classes

LANGUAGE
-3 language classes

COMPUTER
-1 class that actually deals with how to use a computer (beyond just going on the internet); hardware, HTML, a little bit of hacking, etc.

GOOD CITIZENRY
-Home Economics
-Economics
-US Government
    +have this one cover the media as well, since it's the Fourth Estate
-Sociology

I'm aware this leans heavily towards liberal arts.  What can you expect from a history major."

"event","And now I've finished all my Persian history books, so here's a rundown of those.  Except shorter this time.

-Life in the Ancient Near East 3100-332 BCE (Snell) - Fairly dry stuff, basically details in a condensed manner the political and social history of Sumer/Egypt/Israel/Babylon/Assyria etc. over a long period of time.  It really puts the historical time frame in perspective, but there's no real narrative so it's better as a reference book than anything.

-Heritage of Central Asia (Frye) - Really dry stuff, definitely for specialists in the region.  Don't bother reading it unless you can envision geography well in your mind.

-Ancient Persia (Wiesehofer) - Again, really dry stuff, clearly for specialists.  No real narrative, just focuses on the fragmentary evidence (a lot of it being archaeological or linguistic) relating to the three pre-Islamic Iranian empires.  I get the feeling a lot of German history is written this way.

-The Persian Empire (Allen) - Tons of pretty pictures, basically a coffee table history book.  A very good introductory book for people who don't know anything about the first Persian (Achaemenid) Empire, ending with Alexander the Great's conquest.

-Landmark Herodotus - A translation of Herodotus' massive histories.  Obviously it's not exactly...trustworthy, but it's still excellent stuff.

-The Great Arab Conquests (Kennedy) - A collection of the various narratives of the Islamic conquests in the Near East, Iran, the Maghreb, Spain, Central Asia, Sind, etc.  There's some annoying spelling errors and historical inaccuracies (he says at one point that the Roman Empire was at its height...in the 8th century), but it's an enjoyable read.  Also has a lot of interesting side stories.

-Shadows in the Desert (Farrokh) - Iranian history from an Iranian's perspective.  Pretty interesting, well written, and full of pretty pictures, even if Farrokh's nationalism pops through every now and then.

-Rome and Persia in Late Antiquity (Dignas) - Another good reference book but not particularly good reading material.  If you want a narrative, there's a billion other books that cover this stuff, I'm sure.

Happy Easter."

"event","""Part of the reason that Western economists and theorists have failed in predicting China is because we tend to view rights as part of development, and by that standard China is not in fact leading the world or providing any kind of example as a model of development. What we can view as ""development"" - when you talk about roads and factories - is exactly the kind of development that China has, nothing more and nothing less. They build entire fake cities to house temporary populations and abandon them with no future planning when the populations move out. Their education system is a hollow indoctrination that creates quasi citizens who can't do much more than pass standardized tests. Their ""security"" is based on a thuggish police force that disappears people, runs rackets on local business and whose primary job seems to be actively ignoring people who need help. Cultural norms that dampen down any kind of dissenting activity are actively promoted by the government and most ""institutions"", and the only way to start a company, start a new venture, create a ""new"" product, or get anything done on a capital scale involves investing in local official's pockets.""

I found this to be a pretty interesting article.  It's a small survey of Pakistani students' opinions on drone attacks within the tribal regions, and considering it's super small sample size (15 students) I wouldn't take it as a scientific survey, exactly, but it does bring up some interesting points I hadn't thought about.  I would have assumed most Pakistanis would have been opposed to the drone bombings right off the bat as a violation of sovereignty, and while I'm sure the people actually living within FATA aren't too happy about it (to put it...lightly), these students bring up some Pakistani viewpoints I hadn't considered before.  The fact that they don't even see FATA as part of Pakistan was pretty intriguing.

Looking at the rest of that site, it reminds me that I need to pay more attention to what's going on in Central Asia (the other -stans), a really overlooked but critically important area.  I got a taste of the geopolitics there when I took an Afghanistan class a while back, but I've gotten totally distracted from reading about it since then.  Did you know the Taliban were appropriated (and to an extent created) by Pakistan to serve as a merc army to help them build a pipeline into Central Asia since the energy markets had opened up after the USSR's monopolies crumbled? Well now you know."

"event","Right now, I'm thinking this is going to be my the topic I shoot for with the honors thesis:

The destruction of the polis system under Alexander the Great and the Diadochi did not lead to an era of ""individualism"" as usually stated, but a search for meaning and stability in new forms of social connection, as can be observed in the religions (mystery cults, ruler worship), philosophies (Cynicism, Epicureanism, Stoicism), and utopian movements of the Hellenistic period.

It still has some rough edges to work out but I think that should suffice."

Somalia just happens to be a quick hop away from Yemen, where all the GOP was pushing for invasion just a month ago if you remember.  And there's pretty good business reason to do so.

It will be interesting to see if things do end up going this way.  I've expected the US to get involved in Africa and the Indian Ocean for some time now, especially due to China's growing demand for oil and expansion of its fleet."

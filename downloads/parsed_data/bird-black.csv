<B><font size=1>  comment to be added or kept bitches.


                   leave your name,age, and reason why i should add you.

if your not added i dont trust you.
 
                      if your added i love you.

I talk about my problems, my friends, and my life, if you don't want to read it, and if you are going to criticize my writing, then don't add me. Simple.

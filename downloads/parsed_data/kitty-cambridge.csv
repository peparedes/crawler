"event","Sooo this weekend was probably one of the best weekends ... I had a girl's night out friday and saturday. Friday went to see Brother's Grim , Thinking heath ledger would be freakin Hott! Well since the movie was set in 1796 he looked extremely old .. so it made me quite sad. Saturday was full of fun! I had an email in the middle of the week giving me an invitation to go ""mini baja"" driving. like go-carts , but made for mud and dirt ,etc..So I ventured out and tried something new. I never go alone so I invited my roommate hillary and suitemate Katrina. It was soooo much fun!We waited in like for probably 15 mins or so then it was our turn to drive. I was the front car which seemed to be the fastest one out of the three. I was wearing a black tank top and I was all geared up in a helmet and goggles.. So I drove thru some mud and everytime I would try to miss it the tire would hit it and spray all this mud over my arms ... lol . One of the hills I went on had mud as well and a huge clump went straight in my boobs! It felt kinda funny , lol . Anyway after that it was around 5-ish or sooo , so I was extremely hungry and went to publix for a yummy sub. then after we all kinda ate I decided to DYE MY HAIR !I picked out this strawberry blonde ... it turned out pretty well .. I wouldnt mind having it a lil bit more blonde , but oh well! People say it looks really natural . So then the day was def. not over , and the girls and I planned on going to the Roxy night club since we had free passes!! We got all dolled up and headed to da club , lol. I must say its my fav. so far. The worst is antigua off of church st ( soo ghetto) anyway ... that night was really cool , didnt dance with many people , mostly katrina and hillary cuz it must have been mexican night . I raved a lil to some techno and people crowded around me . Just my element , felt like home again. Then I went to get a drink of water at the bar with the girls and the bartender told me to dance ...I said no thanks , but he wouldnt give up .. So I hopped on the bar and danced for what seemed the whole night . I would rather dance higher than the people who dance on the floor cuz 1. I dance alone and not with other nasty ass guys , 2. I can see everything thats going on , 3. It was fun for me to dance my style and not worry about others trying to hit on me. I had a blast. then the night was over.. I slept really well into the afternoon of today  (sunday) and then basically did some laundry and ummm watched tv, ordered pizza with the roomies and chilled... oh yeah and studied for calculus ...ick! So that was my weekend full of fun. I  keep thinking about ryan and all my friends I havent seen in what feels like forever. But I truly miss ryan a lot and I dont think he really understands... which is alright I guess.. but oh well . I just hope he hurries up and moves up here for Full Sail. Lol soo if anyone actually reads this , they should def. leave me notes... Ttyl!! peace!!!!"

"event","Ever have one of those sleeps where u feel your not sleeping and you feel very aware of your surroundings... yeah include me in the number ,cuz I couldnt sleep. I guess it was the feeling of waking up at 7:30 this morning to get the shower before my suitemate did ... so I wouldnt be late for my 9am class.I went to the marketplace for breakfast just as they were taking the food all away ... those mean people , but the line for an omlette was still there . So I had an egg and cheese omlette ( nothing special).Anyway , I didn't have calculus today ... I kinda like the atmosphere of the class. The people are very down to earth , except the one guy who has huge eyebrows and never stops starring at me ... oh did I mention he likes to walk me to my dorm .. i only let him get away with that twice .. I've learned to be the first one out of class to avoid him . It sounds so bad , lol.But hey what am I suppose to tell him , ""hey u creep me out go away!"" I can't do that.hmmm what else. Oh the real world is on tonight , but since yesterday talking to Brad and Camron they told me danny and malinda(sp) are together after the show has ended and they live together. soo I guess in my mind I can watch the show with relief. ::sigh:: don't know what to do right now .. kinda bored. I guess homework. I was looking thru my pictures yesterday and I realized how much I miss everyone , especially the girls. Like we all never hung out that much ( it felt like) but i guess in some ways its a good thing then we wouldnt be having in cat fights. I miss ryan a lot .And if i haven't said it enough , i've been very chill up here . I mean no flirting , just friendships and just being mellow not having an urge to impress people. So if ryan is reading this , I hope he can understand I love him.
** Jordi , if  ever read my journal... Im going to Gator Growl !! You gotta get tickets !!!! I wanna come up and say hey !

Peace out :)"

"event","hey ! So I have joined the many people who spill the beans on their lives . Soooo I woke up today around noon . My class on monday is just calculus at 330 to 420. But today was the ""real"" begining of calc... the 1st quiz !! So the material was on basic domain and Fog and Gof .. I studied all night last night to make myself perfectly comfortable with the material .. I im-ed my friend who is a senior here and he listened to my answers .. and told me i got them all right !! So the studying totally paid off. I'm excited now , it just proved my bad theory wrong from last night ( long story , but im sure I'll relive the moment again) So Im starving and i haven't had any food today . I've been doing that lately .. feeling bad for using my parents money to eat . Kinda odd right ? yeah I agree with myself .. but i do soo I try to eat as little as possible. I think im gonna head to the gym later tonight and work off some pounds...


Ok so I left the window of this open cuz I ran out to go eat dinner.. then one of the other main events today was Brad and Camron from the real world ( like 2 shows ago) came to our school to answer questions and etc. It was really nice , someone asked camron to kick them in the balls , cuz she did it to brad like everyday ... well she did it , and he fell over .It was pretty funny .Camron wouldnt stop talking about her vibrator , lol... and brad was pretty cool . my roomate's friend literally knocked me down after it was over to hug the freakin guy. I mean Brad is cool and all , but not to go run after him and eat him all up , it kinda pissed me off .. like pretty bad . Anyway , next subject ... homework . I gotta go write a 2 pg report on myself .. So i will try to keep this updated as much as I can , i've done this journal thing before , but i could never stay consistent. oh well :) tootles for now"

"event","I am bored bored bored!  I am sitting here watching POTC for like the 100th time.  My aunt is suppose to be coming in today from North Carolina, great!  Oyea, before I forget, thanx to <lj user=""xsx8xsx""> for making the Care Bear in my info and the blinkie at the comments.  

Anywho, last night Kelsea stayed with us.  She came in my room and asked me to watch Pirates!  Mom just looked at her and said ""not u too"".  Yep I knew that was coming.  Now if she starts liking LOTR she will be prefect.  lol  Yea Right!  We only have a week left before we go back to school, gosh!  I dont wanna go back!  We have 9 weeks test too.  I have forgotten everything.   Bio/Eco. should be kindda easy, the other two is the problem.  History is going to be a pain and English may not be that bad.  Owell, I dont wanna leave this semester though.  I have to talk to Ms. Carter when we go back and get her to change my schedule.  I will probably be in Ms. Wheatlys Second and History 3rd then have independent 4th.  Which that is one thing that I need cuz I have Alg 2 first block with Mr. Penlton.  I should have a easy 2nd semester except for that class cuz history really isnt goin that bad. *shew*  

I wanna go to the movies sometime this week to ROTK again but I dont know if mom will let me.  Hutch invited me to go to the movies tomorrow to see PayCheck.  I dont really want to see that but I dont know, I might go.  If I can get someone to go with me to see ROTK, but I dont know if anyone will sit through that again.  Sheena already said she wasnt.  Kim will not go.  I guess that I can call Kayla cuz she has been wanting to see it if she hasnt already.  I guess I will have to call her and then ask dad if he would let me go.  Hopefully he does!  I really need to clean my car, I havent cleaned it in forever.  It has been way too cold though.  Well I guess I will update again later.

"event","Well I got up at 8 this morning!  What the Hell!?!?  I slept all the way to mamaws house.  I stayed up until about 3 last night.  Gosh, I was about to die.  Anywho I went there and stayed there most of the day like always.  Came back home and clean my room for the first time in who knows when.  It was very messy!  The only thing neat was my walls and I wonder why that was.  lol  *cough*Legolas*cough*  I got a lot from Christmas I guess.  The biggest thing is sitting the driveway, yea that counts a Christmas present according to dad.  Even though he got it about 4 months ago!  Lets see I got my whole LOTR book collection, Lost Tales and everything.  I got another poster.  Then I mostly got clothes and money.  *shew*  Long day!  I dont think I am going to dye my hair anymore, I am tired of messing with it.  So I guess I will be leaveing it alone til Prom atleast.  I cant believe Prom is almost here if u think about it, April I think.  I cant wait to go Prom shopping!  I have to get up early in the morning again to babysit, then I have to take my movies back.  Come back home, and my aunts will probably be here.  GREAT!  I want to go back to the movies Saturday but I dont know if mom will let me.  I hope so, I wanna see ROTK again.  I think I am the only one around here that will sit through 4 hours and 37 mins of LOTR!  Owell, dosent bother me any, I will go myself if anything.  lol Well I hope everyone else had a great and safe Christmas.

<lj-cut text=""Quotes"">
You'll never forget the way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet.


I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to.


The moment you feel like giving up, just remember why you've held on for so long.


If he catches you staring at him, at least you know that he was staring back.


If he takes the time to argue with you, he cares more than you know.


It's not what I feel for you. It's what I don't feel for anyone but you.


I always wonder what he's thinking of when he looks at me. I wonder if he really thinks about me at all.


The most beautiful discovery true friends can make is that they can grow separately without growing apart.


Walk a mile in my shoes. See what I see. Feel what I feel. Then realize why I do what I do.


They say the ones you love are the ones you'd die for, but the ones I love are the ones I live my life for. 


Waiting is the worst part of life. Having something worth waiting for, however, might just be the best.


I want to be the one he looks at and says to his friends, ""That's her...""


You may not remember the tests you failed, but I bet you'll remember the person you were with the night you decided not to study.


You know you're crazy about someone when you're willing to take the longest way to class, walk up an extra staircase, and even down an extra hall, just to see them smile. 


Just because someone else is making me smile doesn't mean that I've stopped crying over you.

from trailer] 
Aragorn: Everyday Frodo moves closer to Mordor. 
Gandalf: How do we know Frodo is alive? 
Aragorn: What does your heart tell you? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
[Addressing his troops before battle] 
Aragorn: I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fail... when we forsake our friends, and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. This day, we fight! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
Gandalf: All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
Theoden: I would have you smile again... Do not grieve for those whose time has come. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
Eomer: We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. 
Aragorn: Not for ourselves, but we can give Frodo a chance. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aragorn: For Frodo. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam: You miserable little maggot! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
Frodo: I need you on my side. 
Sam: I am on your side Mr Frodo. 
Frodo: I know you are Sam. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gollum: Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly. 
[Gollum hits his forehead and looks into his hand, screaming at the fly smashed on it] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eowyn: I am no man. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[As he kills the three Orcs guarding Frodo.] 
Sam: That's for Frodo! And that's for the Shire! And that's for my old Gaffer! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eowyn: [To Merry] Whatever happens, stay with me. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
Sam: He means to murder us! 
Gollum: Never! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
Elrond: This is your test. Every path you have trod through, wilderness, through war, has led to this road. The enemy will never let Aragorn come to the throne of Gondor. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[from trailer] 
Arwen: It is time. Give him the sword of the King. 
[Gives the sword to Aragorn] 
Elrond: Become who you were born to be. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[From Trailer] 
Gandalf: The board is set... the pieces are moving 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[From Trailer] 
Merry: [To Pippin] We shall see the Shire again. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[From Trailer] 
Elrond: You gave away your life's grace. I cannot protect you anymore. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legolas: The eye of the enemy is moving! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[after Legolas single-handedly takes out a war elephant and its drivers] 
Gimli: Bah! That still only counts as one! 

*lol*
You have to have seen TTT to understand that.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gimli: I never thought I'd die side by side with an Elf. 
Legolas: What about side by side with a friend? 
Gimli: Aye. I could do that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gimli: Certain chance of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for? 

*gosh*  Gimli is awesome!  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam: Dancing Rosie Cotton. I woulda married Rosie. If I'd have ever married anyone, it would have been her. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eomer: You should not encourage him. 
Eowyn: You should not doubt him. 
Eomer: I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aragorn: Eowyn, why have you come? 
Eowyn: Do you not know? 
Aragorn: It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frodo: I'm glad I'm with you, Sam... here, at the end of all things. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam: Don't go where I can't follow! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merry: You Smoke too much, Pip. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gandalf: I will not say, ""Do not weep,"" for not all tears are evil. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aragorn: [to hobbits as they bow to him] My friends... you bow to no one. 
[Everyone bows to the hobbits] 

*tear*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam: I cannot carry the ring for you, but I can carry you 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frodo: The Ring is mine. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aragorn: Gondor calls for aid! 
[pause] 
Theoden: And Rohan will answer! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam: Put him down, you filth! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pippin: It's so quiet. 
Gandalf: It's the deep breath before the plunge. 
Pippin: I don't want to be in a battle. But waiting on the edge of what I can't escape is even worse. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elrond: [in Elvish] I give hope to the West. 
Aragorn: [in Elvish] I have kept none for myself.

I havent done anything but sleep.  If I can I think I am going to go see ROTK one day next week.  My brother was wanting to go see it and he said he would take me.  That is great!  That movie is awesome!  I also got another poster yesterday I forgot about that.  I got the Return of the King poster with Legolas on it.  They had two, one had a lot of Pictures of Legolas all of it but it didnt say ROTK.  So I got the one that is really close on his face and says ROTK.  I love it, it is next too my TTT one.  Now I need one for FOTR and I will have them all.  I have nothing from fOTR.  That is quite sad coming from me.  Gosh!  There is no one online, <lj user=""mystico_tala"">wont be back for awhile.  Grr!  I need someone to talk too.  Also hopefull I can go this week and try to find the movie Cry Baby with Johnny Depp.  I have been wanting to see that forever but I have never found it, nor the movie Blow.  Yea, I have been on a Depp High all month.  I guess because of POTC.  Understandable I guess!  

I have a new icon of Johnny that someone made for me.  I love it, My Obsession!  My favorite picture of him too.  Will at least I admit that I am obsessed!  

I have not talked to hardly anyone from school.  I will die before I go back but I dont wanna go back for nothing.  I dont want the semesters to change for nothin.  Next Semester is going to suck but atleast I get it changed.  Then again I have to take one of Ms. Wheatlys classes that I missed.  I have to be in there with a bunch of 10th graders.  great!  Owell, it is better than what I had in the first place.  They changed my history though and that sucks too.  I dont know of anyone who has history third, everyone had it 2nd.  I cant believe that LJ is now free.  It took me so long to find a freakin code and now they are free that sucks. That takes a lot out of it! Man, seeing that I am sick, I typed a whole lot.  lol Gosh!  Well I guess I better stop here, I will update later!

It is awesome, OMG!!  At the first of it, it shows about Gollum and everything and I thought was pretty awesome.  Althought PJ cut out a lot of stuff that should have been in the movie that kindda made me mad but it was still an awesome movie.  Legolas was the greatest as usually.  Not that many parts for him though or any of the elves.  He did have an awesome part during the battle with one of the elephants with the evil men.  Then Gimili was like that only counted at one!  That was great, that was one of my favorite parts.  haha  Then of course the end was awesome. They showed what happen to everyone except Legolas and Gimili. That really didnt stay that true to Tolkien but once again it was awesome.  The EE of it will be better!  Everything that was took out will be put back in and gosh!  Things that were in the previews were even taken out, ahh!  We will see the shire again, taken out and saurmon was completely taken out.  He was mentioned once at the beginning that is it!  OK i love the movie!  Sheena went with me btw, lol!  Shew, sorry i have ROTK fever!  yea...  Well lets see what else could I say bouts it, I cried.

"event","Blah!  Long day!!!  I thought it would never end.  Next week will be even more worse.  Mom is talking about not lettin me go to see ROTK unless I ride with someone.  I dont have one but if she doesnt let me go, all hell is going to break lose.  I am goin this weekend to get my car stuff (seat covers....).  They are at Wal-Mart!  lol  They are black with silver dragons on them and they have everything I need.  haha  I love them, so I guess my interior is goin to be done in Dragons!  yay!  It is going to be booty-ful!  Then Josh is going to get me some pin strips for the sides of the car, silver.  Hutch is going to get me something for my car.  I was going to get him another black light but he has everything now.  I love his car, it is awesome.  He will be driveing next semester, I told him that I would bum him for a ride.  haha  I love that car, although I hate mine.  ummm...wonder why!  Yea, that is still pissing me off but owell I dont let things go very easy.  Me and Lindsay were talkin about that today, we got into this big thing about it all.  We starting talking about Liz and how she seems to be gettting on our nerves easier now.  I think I know why too but I am not sure, so I am not going to say.  I done my 50 paintings in Art today, I knew all of them.  It was actually easier than I thought it was going to be.  I am the only one who has done them.  haha  Well Sheena is calling so I think I will go and talk to her.

Yet, I found out that I am not the only with the same idea.  Seems that someone is doing the same thing that I am, I mean the same thing.  AHHH!  It made me sooo pissed!  I got mine done today but I am still going to work on it.  Then Ms. Kern is doing almost all of the drawing for her.  *@!*!@  ahh!  Then my day went down hill from there, I hated it.  I went to change my schedule for next semester and I didnt get anywhere.  Then found out some things that I really did not want to know. I guess just not my day as usual.  owell!

Its easy to stop caring....sometimes

You know how someone's appearance can change the moment you know them? How a really attractive person, if you don't like them, can become more and more ugly; whereas someone you might not have even have noticed... that you wouldn't look at more than once, if you love them, can become the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? All you want to do is be near them. ~Brian, The Truth About Cats and Dogs

<lj-cut text=""Evolution Lyrics"">
The Evolution is a mystery
Full of change that no one sees
Clock makes a fool of history
Yesterday's too long ago
Don't agree with what I know
Tomorrow becomes the place to be


I see the line in the sand
Time to find out who I am
Would you like to see where I stand?
Evolution
Evolution


See my reflection change
Nothing ever stays the same
But you know the name's the Game
We all know what it means
Nothing's ever what it seems
Unforgiven... unforseen

From RVD:

RVD: False. There are way too many Jeff Hardy fans that I see everyday who can't wait to see him back.

WILLIAMSBURG, Va. - Rye Cove RULES!

The Lady War Eagles successfully defended their Virginia High School League Group A state volleyball championship Saturday when they upended previously unbeaten George Wythe 25-20, 26-24, 13-25, 25-22 at Lafayette High School.


And they made history in the process.


Because of the VHSL's flip-flop of the girls basketball and volleyball seasons, Rye Cove (23-2) won its second consecutive state crown in the same calendar year.

""There are two dates these girls will never forget,'' said Lady Eagles head coach Donnie Qualls. ""March 1 and Nov. 22, 2003. This was history today.''

For the second straight match, Rye Cove faced an undefeated team. Northumberland (24-1) was disposed of in Friday's semifinal.

On Saturday at high noon, the Lady Eagles and Lady Maroons (23-1) made it a Southwest Virginia showdown for the championship. Rye Cove had beaten George Wythe in last season's quarterfinals.

After an uncharacteristically sloppy match Friday night, Rye Cove made a whirlwind start against George Wythe. The Lady Eagles led by as many as seven points (22-15) in the first game before the Lady Maroons rallied to make it close, getting within three at 23-20.

Britney Lawson's kill on game point put Rye Cove up 1-0.

The second game was hotly contested with George Wythe leading 20-18 late. Senior hitters Anne Grabner and Whitney Jessee produced back-to-back kills to start a 5-0 run for the Lady Eagles.

George Wythe won four of the next five points to tie the game at 24. But two unforced errors by the Lady Maroons gave Rye Cove the game and a 2-0 lead in the match.

Tasting the title, the Lady Eagles dashed out to an 11-6 lead in game three.

Then, inexplicably, Rye Cove fell apart.

With 6-foot-2 senior hitter Sadie Kitts on the service line, George Wythe went on a monumental run. Kitts served 11 straight points to put her team on top 17-11.

During the comeback, Maroon senior hitter Evelyn Woods had four kills.

""At times this season we've had trouble with our passing,'' Qualls said. ""I was so worried that we were into that again.

""You try to stop the momentum, but what can you do in a one-minute timeout?'' Qualls asked. ""I tried to settle them down and give them some confidence.''

George Wythe outscored Rye Cove 19-3 in that stretch and won the third game 25-13. 

And the Lady Maroons seemed poised to send the match to a fifth and deciding game. They jumped out to a 10-4 lead in the fourth game and were on cruise control. George Wythe was on a 29-7 scoring run and showed no signs of letting up.

Something as simple as an unforced error by the Maroons turned the tide for the Cove.

Grabner went to the service line with her team trailing 10-5.

""I felt if we could get some points back and close the gap, we could win that fourth game,'' Grabner said.

She started her service with two straight aces. By the time her serve was broken, Grabner had led her teammates on a 9-0 run that gave them a 13-10 lead.

""What an awesome performance by Grabner,'' said Qualls. ""Her serve had movement, and suddenly George Wythe had our bad passing disease.''

Eventually, Kitts had another mini-run on the service line and George Wythe led 16-14.

Rye Cove battled back and the two combatants stood tied at 22.

Hope Horton gave the Lady Eagles the lead with a kill, then added a service point to put her team on the threshold of the championship at 24-22.

On match point, Horton put the ball into the middle of the Maroons' defenders.

A set to Kitts looked like a sure kill for a winner, but Lawson and teammate Allison Jessee went up together and simultaneously blocked the shot. When the ball fell harmlessly to the floor, the Lady Eagles jumped for joy.

""Making that block was indescribable,'' Lawson said. ""I can't tell you how I feel.''

Grabner, who finished with 13 service points, six assists, six blocks and 21 kills, was ecstatic.

""This is so special because after winning in March, we knew how hard it was to be the champion. Winning again is so much sweeter,'' she said.

George Wythe head coach Lillie Moore could only shake her head.

""We took too long to play ball today,'' said a disappointed Moore. ""When we got going, it was too little, too late - just too little, too late.''

An excited Qualls perhaps described it best.

""This was a tremendous win for our program. The want to, the guts and the glory all came together. This win came from the heart, and that's Rye Cove volleyball,'' he said.

Horton finished with six kills and five digs for the Lady Eagles while Whitney Jessee added six kills. Gaily Lapitan had 40 assists and five digs with Lawson chipping in nine kills and five digs.

Allison Jessee had five kills and seven blocks. 

Woods had 21 kills for George Wythe, with Kitts adding 14. Ashley Hodge had 45 assists for the Lady Maroons.

<lj-cut text=""Gate City shuts out Haysi to earn Division 2 regional crown::::I know it is not the Cove, but this is just because of my cuz!"">
GATE CITY - Haysi's ball-stripping defense prevented Gate City from scoring at will in the first half of Saturday's Region D, Division 2 football championship game at Legion Field.


Gate City's defense kept Haysi from scoring at all.


The Great Blue Wall didn't allow the Tigers anywhere near the red zone as Gate City rolled to a 42-0 victory that clinched a Group A state semifinal showdown with Radford in two weeks.


Haysi (10-2) only got past midfield twice during the entire ballgame - and one of those times was due to a Gate City turnover. Haysi quarterback Jake Colley was held to 54 yards passing, while the Tigers were reduced to 58 yards total rushing.


""They were up knocking us in the face on man coverage. We couldn't get loose and when we did get loose a couple of times, we dropped a couple of passes,"" said Haysi head coach James Colley.

""What do you do when you get into a hornets' nest? They're all over you. There wasn't much we could do against them. It was like a bunch of men playing with boys.""


Gate City (12-0) initiated scoring in its first possession of the game, powering over Haysi in a six-play, 58-yard scoring drive capped by a 3-yard touchdown run by Luke Humphreys at 7:48 in the first quarter.


While the Blue Devil defense proceeded to cage the Tigers, the Gate City offense ended its next two possessions with fumbles by quarterback Isaiah Spivey.


Four snaps before Spivey's first turnover, flanker Joe Erwin dropped a probable touchdown pass. Four snaps prior to Spivey's second turnover, the Blue Devils had a 73-yard scoring run by fullback Pookie Byrd called back due to an illegal motion penalty.


Both of Spivey's fumbles occurred while he was gaining additional rushing yardage after first contact with a defender.


""When you get that second effort, with that spin your arm comes out and the ball gets away from your ribs and it's not as secure,'' said Gate City head coach Nick Colobro. 

""They had a lot of people flying to the ball trying to grab it and knock it loose. I think they were doing a great job of trying to strip the ball. And it's hard to fault our kids for second effort.""


Spivey said he thought the Gate City offense as a whole didn't play with its usual intensity for the better part of the first half. But he thought Haysi's defense deserved some credit.


""Oh yeah. They were doing a good job. The first guy stands you up and the recruits come in and try to strip it. I guess they've worked hard on that in practice,"" said Spivey, who posted 48 yards rushing.


The Blue Devils finally got their offensive house in order with a 12-play, 80-yard drive capped by Spivey's 12-yard touchdown pass to Byrd with 1:36 left in the half.


Moments later, Haysi's Elijah Owens fumbled the kickoff and Corey Shepherd pounced on it at the Tiger 19-yard line. Six snaps later, Tyler Kilgore - who led all Gate City rushers with 117 yards - punched it across from the 4 with 48 seconds left in the half.


After Enolih Gardner's PAT - one of six he'd hit flawlessly on the day - the Blue Devils held a more comfortable 21-0 lead at intermission.


Haysi's window of opportunity would not reopen. Gate City took the opening-half kickoff and drove it 58 yards in seven plays, capped by Kilgore's 1-yard TD crash at 9:08 in the third quarter.


After the Tigers' offensive hopes and dreams were crushed on the next series, Will Hubbard returned Jake Colley's 40-yard punt 42 yards to the Haysi 7-yard line.


It took exactly one play for Erwin to have his moment of redemption when Spivey found him in the end zone for a TD pass with 6:33 left in the third quarter.


Gate City's second offense took to the field for its next possession, adding another score on <b>Travis Sanlin's 24-yard run with 10:22 left to play.</b>


<b>Sanlin finished with 45 yards</b>, while Will Humphreys added 56 for the Blue Devils, who posted 454 yards total offense.


""We outmanned them up front. We're a lot bigger team than they were,"" said Gate City's 6-foot-4, 260-pound offensive and defensive lineman, Jared Wininger.

""They fought hard and caused a few turnovers in the first half to keep it close. But we came out in the second half and did what we needed to do to go on to game 13.""

Quotes:

""Have u ever been in love? Horrible, isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens ur heart and it means someone can get inside u and mess u up. U build up all these defenses. U build up this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt u, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into ur stupid life...u give them a piece of u. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss u, or smile at u, and then ur life isn't ur own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside u. It eats u out and leaves u crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like 'maybe we should just be friends' or 'how very perceptive' turns into a glass splinter working its way into ur heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-u-and -rips-u-apart pain. I hate love."" 
  ^My whole anti-love thing there!  lol

Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you but trusting them not to

The hardest part about walking away is knowing you'll never run after me

The heart speaks a language of which the mind knows nothing"

"event","Yea, that subject tells a lot, it is the truth though.  Hutch told me the worst thing today.  He said that Josh is leaveing Cove after Chritmas.  Guess what, it is the truth!  :(  My best friend  and the one person I love more than anything is leaveing me.  He said that he is not sure but he said he wants to leave.  I know the whole story but I am not even suppose to be saying this.  He told me not to say anything about it.  So maybe the ppl who know him will keep their mouths shut.  It seems like when I do say that someone goes and say something.  Gosh!  I have known Josh since K.  That whole time we have been best friends.  I dont want him to leave, it seems like graduation is coming early and I HATE IT!  I will die next semester without him.  Today was not my day and this is not my year.  Most of my friends are getting on my nerves very badly.  Gosh, I hate this day!"

Very long indeed!  Now I am sitting here watching The Two Towers.  I guess that is a good way to make things better.  Hutch came back today, he is really sick and I am worried about him.  I am going to call him later to see how he is.  I tried to get him to leave early and I would take him home. I would call mom and get premission to leave early, but he said no.  I got my rough draft done today and turn it in and got my 100.  The final paper is due Thrus I think.  ahhh!  I feel like crap.  I think I am getting sick.  not good!  I worked on my scroll this morning in art, it has the whole.....3 rings for the elven kings under the sky....thing on it.  I like it, I just got to find somewhere for it.  um....not all that much happen today.  Yea I got left at lunch by everyone.  So, I got to sit by myself.  That kindda pissed me off.  No one tells me anything, they just leave me.  owell!  I guess that is the sum of my day, a boring one at that.  Well, I am gone!"

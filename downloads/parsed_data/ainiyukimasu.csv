"event","Stradling the old bike left at the bottom of the stairs, I pedaled and headed out for my work, a judiciary clerk office. It's not even five minutes away. What a welcome distance for someone who's not very good with vehicles.
I've been working here for eight years already.
It has in no way been a short time. Getting married, having a child, and then my wife leaving this star for another. It was a long enough time for all of it to happen.
And so it happened that way, leaving me a 29 year old single father in charge of a six year old son.
The boss here treats me well.
He was an old man eight years ago, and he is now and probably will be an old man until the day he dies. I can't even imagine a boss who wasn't an old man. I don't even know how old he is now. He must be over 80.
He has the countenance of a Saint Bernard with a barrel hanging from it's neck. Although what's hanging from my bosses neck is a double chin. The two seem similar in that my boss is quiet yet warm, and always wearily blinking his watery, sleepy eyes.
Even if there were a Saint Bernard sitting in my boss's place, I might not notice.

When Mio died, I reverted to the way I originally was, a weakling, and lost even the power to breathe.
I left my job for quite a long time and caused quite an inconvenience. Even so, my boss, without even looking for a replacement, waited for me to recover. And even know he lets me stop working at four so I can go home. He granted to me, who longed to leave Yuuji back home from school alone as little as possible, my wish. Although because of that my salary shrank a little, I was able to attain precious time that money simply cannot buy.
I heard that in another town over there was an after-school child care, but there's no such brilliant system exists here. Therefore, I am thankful for the time my boss allows me.

Arriving at the office, I greet Ms. Nagase who had come to work before me.
""Good morning.""
She returns my greeting.
""Good morning.""
When I first became a member of the office, she was already there. She says that she came as soon as she graduated from high school, so by now she must be 26 years old. A lady of serious and reserved character, she has an adult-like countenance to match. I sometimes worry whether there is a place for her amongst girls who pride themselves in self-assertion nowandays. I think someday, while being jabbed by elbows and pushed by feet, she may simply fall off the edge of the world.
My boss still isn't here.
Recently the time he comes into the office is rapidly getting later. Although I don't think there's any correlation with the speed he walks.
And so, for a little while, only the two of us are in the office. This is everything. Even in terms of the amount of work, it seems like an adequate number of people.

Sitting at my desk, I run my eyes down all the memos up on my clipboard. Things like ""bank at two,"" ""go get documents from client,"" and ""you MUST go to the region legals affairs bureau"" are written in letters that are horribly hard to read. They're invoices from the me of yesterday to the me of today.
I'm afraid I have a horrible memory. So I try at all times to write down the things I absolutely have to do.
The weakness of my memory is just one of the many inconveniences that I possess. In the end there must have been a mistake in the layout prepared to make me.
Just one tiny place.
I wonder if it would've been so bad to have just gotten rid of it with white out and write on top of it with a ballpoint pen. Of course it's only a simile, but I think something like it must have happened for real.
In any case, I don't know if the letters got smudged or if they showed through the whiteout, but a random state, in which I started to leak a certain precious chemical substance within my head, was caused. Accordingly, I became a person who sometimes gets unnecessarily excited, gets worried in absolutely foreign environments, can't forget things that they want to, and can't remember the things that they should.
It's incredibly inconvenient. Your movements become restricted and it becomes very exhausting. You mess up a lot of work and become unreasonably underestimated. In other words, you're treated as being incompetent. But I don't go around saying that it's all the fault of the chemical substance in my brain. It's incovnenient and hard to understand, and if you just look at the product of my work, you'd be right to assume my incompetence.
My boss is a kind man, and continues to employ me like this. Miss Nagase backs me up with a kind of casual attention.
I'm very greatful of them."

"event","""Ready to go to school?""
""Huh?""
""Did you put on your name tag?""
""Hn?""
Why the hell is he so hard of hearing? It wasn't like this when Mio was still around. I wonder if the cause of it is something spiritual...
""It's time! I'm heading out!""
I left the apartment, holding Yuuji's hand, who was still halfway between being asleep and awake. I handed him to the leader of a group heading for school and saw him off. Yuuji looks like an infant when he walks next to the sixth year group leader. For being six years old, he sure is small. It's like he's completely forgotten about growing up.

When you see him from behind, the muscles on his neck are thin and white, like a crane's. The hair sticking out from his yellow cap the color of Darjeeling tea with milk.

But even his hair like an English prince will in time thicken, and become curly.

That's the way it went for me too. It's the effect of all the secreting chemical substances in adolescence. When Yuuji reaches that point, he'll grow and surpass me before long. And then he'll meet a girl with an astounding resemblence to his mother, fall in love, and ,if things go well, beget a a copy of his that posesses half of his own genes. Since ancient times have been doing it (and really, all living creatues have). It's a task that will be reapeated again and again as long as this planet rotates."

"event","""What does that mean?"" Yuuji asked.
Well, when Mio died, all her relatives said it, right? Mommy's inside your heart.
""Yeah.""
So, the Akaibu Star is a place where the people that are in the hearts of all the people in the world come together and live on.
Just as long as someone keeps on thinking about someone, that person will keep on living there.
""And if that person forgets?""
Well, then that person must leave the star.
Then it will really be sayonara.

On the last night, everyone will come together and have a farewell party.
""Do they eat cake?""
Yeah, sure. They even eat cake.
""Do they eat <i>ikura</i>, too?""
Yeah, there'd be <i>ikura</i> too. <i>Ikura</i> is Yuuji's favorite.
""And...""
Everything will be there. Don't worry about it.

""Hey, is Jim Botan on the star too?""
Why?
""But you know Jim Botan! That's what you mean about 'being in your heart', right?""
Yeahhh, (I read him ""Jim Botan's Big Locomotive Journey"" the night before), he's there too, I think.

""Well, what about Ema?""
No, not Ema.
There are only humans.
""Hnnn,"" Yuuji paused.

Jim Botan's there. So is Momo. Little Red Riding Hood is there, and of course Anne Frank's there too. But Hitler and Rudolf Hess are there too. So are Aristotle and Newton.

""So, what does everyone do?""
Well, everyone just leads a quiet life of course.
""That's it?""
Well, I guess they'd all be thinking about something now, wouldn't they?
""Thinking? What about?""
Really hard things. It takes a lot of time until they get an answer. So, even when they go to that star, they're always thinking.
""Mommy too?""
Mommy's thinking about you, Yuuji.
""Really?""
Yep.
And so you'll never forget mommy now.
""I won't.""
Yeah, but you're tiny. You only lived with mommy for five short years.
""Yeah...""
So, now I'm going to tell it all.
What type of girl mommy was like.
In what way she met daddy, how they got married.
And then how happy you made her when you were born.
""Yeah.""
And I want you to always remember.
When daddy goes to that star to be with mommy, you always have to remember mommy.

Got it?
""Huh?""
Oh well.

"event","This is how I thought when Mio died:

The person who made our star was probably somewhere out there in the cosmos, making one more star. A star where all the dead went. That star's name was the Akaibu Star.

""Akabui?"" Yuuji asked.
No, no. Akaibu.
""Akabui?""
Akaibu.
Yuuji started to say ""Aka"", paused, and finished with ""ibu"".
Good enough.
That place is like a giant library: quiet, clean, and tidy.
It's so big that you can't see the end of the halls that link the building.
There, the people who have left our star live on in peace.
This star, to put it in words, is like the inside of our hearts."

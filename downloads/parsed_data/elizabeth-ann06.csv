"event","In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotions taking me over
cought up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Don't you know that there'll be nobody left in this world
To hold me tight
Don't you know that there'll be nobody left in this world
To kiss goodnight"

"event","Today is going ok i guess. today is my mans birthday. he is 17 i love him very much. he is gonna come down this weekend. we are gonna have a lot of fun. i really love him but we fight all  the time over stupid things. i love him but i hate fighting all the time. there is just some things he says that really hurt my feelings. i always think about it is gonna be if we get married and when we move in together and it seems to me that if it is really meant to be then we will stay together when we go off for college. that will really show me if we are really gonna be together. i guess i am just afraid to see him with another girl IF we do ever brake up. other guys i have dated have cheated on me and i just cant really trust any guys. i dont wanna get hurt anymore. i told myself that i am never gonna be hurt over a guy and im not. i have only got hurt one time by Dustin that is when he broke up with me because i told him what i thought about his mom and dad and little brother. well thats what he said it was for. then he told me it was because he thought i wouldnt let him hang with his buddies. (but i would have.) that really hurt me when he lied to me. but his mom dad and little brother dont treat him with the repsect that he deserves. no one should be treted the way he gets treated. there stupied dog get treated better then he does. it the dog John and sometimes him... i love him with all my heart and i wanna treat him so much better than his mom dad and little brother. i know i am just going on and on about Dustin but i love him and i want him to know i do treat him with the respect he deservs and i would put him before any dog. he is better than that. his mom and dad treat him so bad. his dad calls him names and the look on his face just makes you wanna cry and his dad love that ulgy dog. it looks like mutt off the street that you just got from the trash cane. and his dad is so lazy and everyone should bow-down to him. but i dont and i am never going to. and his mom treats John better than him and John does no wrong in her eyes. and just like his dad his mom treats the dog better than him. well John and the mutt is the same with his mom. she respeacts THEM more than Dusitn. i just want them to treat him with the respect that everyone else does. he is so gorgeous and loving in many ways and no one needs to be treated like they treat him. i dont wont him to get mad at me but he knows i say what is on my minde. if i dont tell him i tell it in a note or i email him or i just write it on my live journal. i just wont him to know that i love him and the only reason i am saying this is because i love him and i wont him to know that i love him and miss him when im not with him...
~HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY AND I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!~"

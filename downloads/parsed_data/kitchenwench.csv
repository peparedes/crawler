I simply don't have time.  *cries*  This is horrible.  *beats school ferociously with a stick*  As if there aren't enough emotional traumas being wreaked on the world as well right now.  *sigh*  Yeah...

<p>Well, hell, thought I'd pop in.  Scrawl down a little, because I want to.  But only oh-so-briefly, because I have an utterly amazing shitload of things to do this weekend.  *shakes her head*  Something's gonna snap.  I don't know what yet.  But something's gotta.

"event","<font size=1>Husking Bee rawks.  This is the best Japanese music I've heard.  (Okay, so the only Japanese bands I've heard are Cibo Matto, Pizzacato Five, and Yoko Ono...)  Still.  ""A Small Potato's Mind"" is <i>awesome</i>.  I haven't a clue why it's called that or what they say during the song, but who gives a rip.

<p>So, I got my schedule from school in the mail today.  It's pretty damn awesome (English first hour?  Second hour Ceramics?  I don't have to even <i>think</i> till 4th hour.) except I don't have a free hour first semester and that simply won't do.  So I'll have to either drop or switch something, but that's okay.  

<p>In other news:  Hung out with the old people today and am nearing the completion of my France page.  As for <u>Crime and Punishment</u>... going nowhere fast.  *grins*

<p>You lucky folks.  I went to the grocery store again.  I didn't have a list; it was just to buy lunch, which is a bad time to go grocery shopping because you're hungry and, well, <i>everything</i> looks appealing.  Some purchasing highlights include:

<li>cinnamon bread
<li>more mandarin-lime juice spritzers
<li>Leann Chin chicken wings
<li>sushi
<li>nasty carrot juice for my mom
<li>sundried tomato and balsamic vinegar potato chips
<li>mixed organic greens salad w/chicken and raspberry vinaigrette
<li>grilled sandwich
<li>peaches and nectarines and cherries

See.  Look at that.  So much food.  *shakes her head*  *sighs heavily and wanders off to do sucky web junk for the old people place she volunteers at*

*mashes her face into the keyboard*  I just spent the last 2+ hours without power.  Stupid NSP.  Actually, they got bought over.  Now they're Excel Energy.  But whatever.  This is a moot point.  

<p>Anyway, I don't know how people did it back in the day.  I was so bored, I actually read <i>more</i> of <u>Crime and Punishment</u>.  In fact, I was in the middle of updating my LJ when suddenly my screen flickered and everything went black and the I cried.   So, yes, this is why I return, except  forgot what it was that I was updating, so I say, Heck, let's post another entry because Imp would read my grocery list.  *grins*

I just read fifty pages of <u>Crime and Punishment</u> in a sitting.  And it truly was criminal, not to mention punishment.  *whimpers b/c her Rufus' keyboard is sticky*  So I finally fixed the layout on the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~theroyalty"">Royalty LJ</a> as much as one possibly can, given the constraints of this service.  *shrugs*

I... always swore I'd never put my diary online.  In fact, I probably still won't.  What exactly I plan to do with this is still beyond me, but, gosh, it sure was fun playing with the colors... Also, look how nicely those kittens coordinate with my colors!  (And I don't even <i>like</i> kittens...)

"event","Ive been busy lately.  i work three days a week which automatically translates to 4-5 in jason's head (my mgr).  But at least he gives jer and i some of the same days.   other than work, its homework or a date maybe... there've been two real ones so far, one at outback last night to go see jason (jer's brother) he works at the durham store.  Everything just seems to be working out lately.   I think i even decided what im gonna do in life... right now its a business management major then im going to go to culinary school.. thats the updated version.

I saw my ex this past weekend, i think that situation is a little weird.  He lives in california now so its not like we bump into each other.  I don't know, just the thought that i was really close to him at one point and now im close to someone else is a little weird.  but we had a good lunch and some catching up so......

well i gotta go get ahead with my math homework so i don't have to do it for the rest of the year...."

Of course we didn't really even get to begin our date til after outback closed... but what ya gonna do right?
Something really weird though... Charlotte likes him.  She let him pet her and wasn't afraid of him...  She doesn't do that for anyone.  (heather walked in and she ran out) I dunno, just a thought.

"event","<P>Last night was fun.&nbsp; I didn't think i was going to go out then at the last minute i got some calls and rounded up the boys to go out.&nbsp; None of my few girl friends would go out <EM>**cough**Mary**cough**.</EM>&nbsp; Stuart picked me up and we headed over to KDR.&nbsp; Since things are over between me and Nelson my priorities were focused on someone else.&nbsp; The first few minutes were the roughest. Stuart left with Nelson to go pick up something*.&nbsp; I walked in expecting something that wasn't there.&nbsp; I went up and talked to him slowly realizing i had gotten my hopes up over something that was less than i thought it to be.&nbsp; I went and sat down on a table waiting for Stuart to get back&nbsp;and managed to meet a few people.&nbsp; The dancing started and of course i couldn't pass that up even if a sketchball was my only oppourtunity.&nbsp; I'd later be rescued by my friends.. so what the hey? why not?&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dance or two Stuart helped me out.&nbsp; I love that kid.&nbsp; He's so funny, he was my buddy for the night.&nbsp; Occasionally the sketchball would come back, but my friend Morgan (a guy) stepped in and pretended to be my boyfriend.. that was hilarious... i've never had anyone do that for me before.&nbsp; He didn't come back after that.&nbsp; I love these kinds of parties though, just because you meet all the people you would never go up to, and of course you run into old ones.&nbsp; One of the highlights of the night had to be when one of my old crushes got slightly jealous of me dancing with other guys... not the obsessive, im gonna stalk you way. but just the, i was keeping my eye on you and i still think youre hot :) kinda way.&nbsp; It was a ego boost though, or at least it made me feel better about my not so good luck with guys lately.&nbsp; Overall not how i expected, but in a good way.</P>
<P>Today was a veg day.. well i got up at 9:30 to go get a hair cut at Leon's...&nbsp;&nbsp; go there! its cheap and it won't turn out bad (but if youre a worrier you'll go nuts).&nbsp; It took 2 hours!! haha.&nbsp; Tell Tom i sent you though.&nbsp; It probably won't take two hours for you but ... well its a long story for me.&nbsp; So i did that then went and had lunch with heather.&nbsp; Came back to the house and and slept for a long time. Then got up made some dinner and watched my CSI ( i miss it since i work)&nbsp; then did nothing til i wrote this and you read it.</P>

<OL>
<LI>The Power turns off when we use our microwave</LI>
<LI>The Basement floods</LI>
<LI>Our washer mysteriously turns off</LI>
<LI>Our sink is clogged cant use drain-o because the pipes are old</LI>
<LI>The Refridgerator has its own room</LI>
<LI>We have to lock the inside with a key (so when you come to the door, if we can't find our key, youre gonna be there awhile)</LI>
<LI>Mary's light switch is on the outside of her room while Heathers's is on the far wall of her room</LI>
<LI>You flush the toilets and the hot water goes away, or comes in full blast</LI>
<LI>(this is Tom's) you cover the holes in the floor with giant boards, then warn people when they come over of the holes so they don't fall in and get dirty.&nbsp; (When he moved out the house was condemned)</LI>
<LI>The counters are different heights and not level</LI>
<LI>My room leaks</LI>

i figured it out, hes the perfect boyfriend.. He sleeps with me every night and doesn't hog the covers, he can't cheat on me by choice, hes not needy and doesn't get mad if i don't spend one night without him.  He's always there for me and isn't afraid to spoon. Best part is that he's really easy to turn on! its great!  and if i get too hot i can just turn him off without feeling any guilt what-so-ever.  Anyways weve been dating ""on"" and ""off"" for the past few months.. i think its getting serious now tho, i mean ill probably spend valentines day with him, we'll cuddle up and watch a movie or something...

I have to say it was kinda weird just to go back to serving after not working for 9 or so months.  i thought i was gonna screw up. and no one came in to see me:( what that about?? huh guys???    i work wednesday fyi ;)      so ill let you sit in my section if you come in.

i went to see gordo about a week or so ago, i miss him alot i don't know how i live without him. we got to talk about a lot of stuff like girls and how they act so retarded and crap like that... and he was like ""so what are the characteristics you look for in a guy"" and i mean i used to have like a few in mind and all, but last year my friend brendan was like... if you met a guy with all those qualities you would be bored.  And he was right... if you could predict everything about him.. then what would be the point of a relationship right?? it would just be so pointless...   so i have no list. its a good thing.  i figure when the right one comes along he'll have all the qualities im looking for, and then that will be my list.       but for now. no boyfriend. no list. hell im not even talking to anyone about dating.   frees up the schedule a lot.
today i went to look for a job.. i went to the gate city chophouse.. i hope they call back, if anyone has any ideas for places or whatnot let me know!! please... and no i don't want to work at the Y jon, cuz i know you were thinking about telling me there would be a good place.  No just say no to your instincts jon!  (good luck with that whole 8 o'clock thing)   you:  damn i gotta go to class at 8 and do something boring

being home is interesting, its like a flashback to highschool.  you move back into your old room for a few weeks and your parents take it upon themselves to reinstate old curfews and rules... omg why is it that when youre home they always want to know where you are and when youre gonna be there... they dont know while were off at school and out til 5 in the morning why now???  this is why you never move home after moving out  
then while youre home you take it upon yourself to see all your old friends, not that i dont love them all (i wish i could see them more) its just that you pick the times that youre home to see them   oh and my parents don't understand how time translates     for me breakfast is like 12 for them its like 7   i love being home, buts its nice to be at my own place.... i wish i could have the best of both worlds... but at least i dont have to get up at 6 to go to school....

i was thinking about this the other day. what do girls really want in guys?? well heres some tips for you guys... girls go ahead and comment to tell me how to better it.   

every girl is waiting for her knight in shining armor to ride up on his white stallion, to sweep her off her feet with something better than just an average pick up line, and take her on an amazing first date that she'll never forget, something she'll think about for the next month to come.  And the kiss, the kiss has to be perfect, spontaneous and exciting and passionate, all while being respectful of her.  He will call the next day if he really is interested in her, none of that waiting three days, if she likes him she'll want him to call, and if not she doesn't have to agree to another date.  While on dates he won't answer his cell phone unless its his grandma...  after each date he will walk her to her door, he'll call when he says he will.  he'll remember small things like the first kiss, or that night when he talked to her on the phone for two hours..  he'll know what just a single flower means to her.....

but lets face it.......








we don't have much to work with here, do we ladies?

"event","Tonight i went to go see.... guess, you'll never guess.... dammit its in the title, i forgot silly me.  Anyways i went with my good pals eddie, nate, and brandon.    Fun times, its funny how much you can miss the slack pack when their away slacking off at a party school!!  Good job guys!!  im just joking with them (i love you all)  but it wasn't a bad movie, same effect as the first i guess.. i won't tell anymore, in case you go see it.

so my friend eddie was telling me how he needs a date, so i took the liberty of posting his info or whatever on my journal, so the whole ten of you can read it!! yay

ok, first lets talk about eddie

well i met eddie a few years ago, when he was obsessed with me. im telling you he wouldn't quit asking me out. i mean hes an attractive guy and all, but he's just not my type.... well anyways hes about 6' 2"" and lets say average weight....not fat... not freakishly thin. the good size. no offense to others out there. hes very shy and likes to play baseball. he attends east carolina university, so hes very scholarly indeed. ( you know you like the smart ones)   hes sarcastic (in a BIG way), funny, and fun-loving, these words couldn't describe eddie better.  Oh and eddie has an obsession with nascar... his whole room is nascar themed. he even has a little race car bed, its sooo cute  and his dresser is a gas pump, this is all tied together by the track rug that he has, its adorable


alright, heres what i think eddie is looking for in a girl  

attractive
fun-loving, cant forget that adjective
smart, well lets say tries at school
takes care of herself
must be in the 14-35 age range
drinks
doesn't smoke
likes football
can bring beer on command
doesn't hog the bed
knows the papa john's # by heart

if you fit 8 out of the 11 then please leave a post, unless its the age one, thats just creepy

well thats it for me, later   -al"

"event","Got all my exam grades back... not so good. its not that their bad, its just that their bad for the school of nursing.  This sucks. My mom thinks its a sign that maybe i shouldn't be studying for nursing, and i totally agree, i mean nursing is a great profession/career/job and all, but i feel like i would kinda be stuck in one role the rest of my life, and at what point would i get tired of giving people sponge baths??  these are questions that i ask myself.. or maybe i did poorly because i had a boyfriend, or lack of a job... these are things that were different this past semester.  So i went out and searched for a job... no replies yet, but then again its only been a day, so maybe good news!!  who knows??  So, my outlook on life has changed, maybe a whole different career ahead of me, maybe no more monotone Mrs. Collins!!   :)  That'd be nice.    I'm thinking about taking up engineering or graphic design.  Hmm... i just don't know yet.  we'll see how it goes!           


HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE!!

love al"

"event","As im sitting there procrastinating studying for micro i think ""hey, i know what i can do!! ill go make a journal that'll take awhile"" besides whats more private than an online journal? ..i can't think of anything can you??  so then i was like ""why don't i write down all my thoughts so everyone can read them and be like hey, thats what shes really thinking. but then i thought maybe no one would talk to me since their reading my journal""... hmm dilemma, huge dilemma... so then i was like  ""ill just write pointless crap to keep people amused... yeah thats good""   so here we are, you and i, and i have yet to make you laugh thus far.... im a failure. i know it. you don't have to say anything.... (but you could say that im not... that would make me feel good about myself)  ...have you noticed i haven't really put any real info in here yet that ive been talking to you and yet you keep reading...!!! its amazing really. you must not have anything better to do than to read my journal.  well i do. im gonna go procrastinate my microbiology studying by watching adult swim- you should go check it out!  so im sorry to end it short on you but i must go.. but you can leave a comment and make me feel cool!    im out-allie"

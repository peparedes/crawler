So when I come back I feel, as of right now anyway, that I will have to choose between a social life or having a job which I truly need. 

I know I got used Heres a news flash mother, Driving comes with having kids. 

I tried so hard not to throw it in her face that its her fault that I am not a good driver, and its her fault that I dont already have my license, which I could have had last summer. But since I didnt say anything, she did. She said it to make me feel bad... thats fucked up. 

I know shes stressed. And Im sure that life wont be so bad when I get back. But I am also sure that unless Douglas gets a car and his license I will be fucked on the boyfriend time for quite some while.

Doug is my favorite pillow.

Anyway
 
Not only did I get to see Doug, but he bought me a rose to surprise me with, and then he bought me pop tarts. He makes me feel so special...

And then after school... Chris wasnt home... So we had the bedroom to our selves... Need I say more?

And that was Amazing too...

I dont know why...

So much has changed in the past year. I want everything to go back to normal. I dont know how to deal with what goes on in my head. I take things to personally when I shouldnt, and I blow them off when I shouldnt. Its like I am in my own little world and I have to catch up with reality...

Thats a good way to explain it...

Me and Douglas get into the dumbest fights. I hate it. 

I get so overly moody sometimes. Nobody wants to be around me. 

I hate that too...

Everytime something good happens, something bad happens. 

Please tell me why Life cant be nice... Please..."

Thank you for my Easter Basket Douglas. Me and Mr. Duggy (the rabbit you gave me) are going to bed now. 

Amanda. I love you. I told my mommy. She said she misses you.

Actually she said, ""I would rather fly her up here for a week then fly you down there. It would probably be cheaper, and I want to see her too. I miss Amanda..."" Yea... I should stop there...

I didnt say everything though... dont worry. 

You should call me. 

Actually... Everybody should call me. Pick up the cell phone and dial my number and say whats up. We can chat. It will be great fun. 

Thats the problem with living so far away. Long distance.

Whatever. 

Lame.

Goodnight.

You knew. You told. You ignored it all, and you left. 

I hate how you make me feel. I hate what you do to me, and what you do my family. 

Lies. Excuses.

I dont understand why I care. You were never there, and now your gone... But you still come back. You didnt before... Why now?

What do you get when you put <b>Sam, Lonnie, Laura, and Doug</b> in a room with a <b>bottle of Tequila</b> and <b>6 beers</b>? 

<b>4 really trashed teenagers</b>

And when you throw in some <b>weed</b>?

... Can we say <b>awesome</b> weekend?

All I wanted to do was swing back and forth. 

It was so much fun.

Doug had a hard time falling asleep. He kept me up.

And i was the <b>only</b> one who woke up with a hangover... 

That was <b>lame</b>

So Kyla is gone for a week because her parentals are retarded. 

I wonder if things between us will be ok again...

If I could tell Chris what I thought of him, it would open his eyes and he would become more aware of what he does... 

OR

It would put him in therapy for the rest of his life...

I do not like that kid.

I have so much to do tomorrow. I want to go to Douglas's house after school on Thursday sooo badly! I swear I will stop talking to my mother if she tells me no.

I miss Douglas...

I finally got around to listening to the 3 voicemails Amanda left me when I went out with Doug to dinner. I HAD LEFT MY PHONE AT HOME. Thank You Amanda! She said that Danielle might come down again too this summer. Well heres the truth, plain and simple, I could care less if I hang out with her this summer, and I want as much 'Sam and Amanda hanging out like the good ol' days' as I can get. And that never involved Danielle. So if she shows up and thinks that she is going to be incorporated into everything shes wrong. I am not sharing all my time this summer!!!

My mom has no clue he was at Lonnies house last night.  

Dana is supposed to come over tonight, but I havent talked to her all day. Im about ready to go to bed and give up on the whole idea... I dont think I want to be around anybody tonight. I think if She does call me I shall tell her I am feeling sick, and see what happens...

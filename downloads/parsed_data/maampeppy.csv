"event","Going through some rough patches right now.  My sister-in-law had a miscarriage about 2 weeks ago.  My mom called my dad and informed him that they need to have a chat.  Don't know what that is going to be about, but I can honestly say that the possibilities running through my mind are not hopeful.  A mentor (of sorts) to me discovered she has breast cancer (caught early, will know more after her trip to the cancer center on the other side of the state later this week).  A family that I know and dearly love are walking their father/husband through what appears to be the end stages of brain cancer.  And while they're finding humor and joy in the most unlikely of all circumstances, it's still a rough thing to watch.

The list could go on and on.  And I know that each of us could add even more to the list of concerns that we have not only about ourselves and our own lives, but those who have touched our lives in some way, shape or form.  I've cried more in the last two weeks than I have in the last couple of months.

I'm learning, though, that the tears are a healthy thing...something that I need to go through and allow to flow in order to have a release that I can't really get anywhere else.  Not by eating, not by exercising, not by talking things over and over again, not even in prayer or journaling.  Like this evening during our cool down period at Zumba, where I started tearing up because of the song that was playing, I may be doing those things (eating, praying, journaling, etc...), but those things are not necessarily what gives me the sense of release.  It's the crying that does.

I'm learning, in a small measure, what it's like to go through a period of time when you can't pray because the words just won't come and you need the Holy Spirit to intercede with the promised translation of ""moanings"" of your soul into words that God understands.  I say it's a ""small measure"" because really and truly it is--I am blessed beyond belief and do not really know suffering at the same level as many other people in our world do.  It seems trite to say that they are much stronger than I and God wouldn't give them those things to bear if He didn't think/know that they couldn't handle them.  ""That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger"" and all that jazz...

Sometimes I really wonder about what we say in order to comfort ourselves.

I am also going through a period of loneliness.  For the first time in years, I do not have a small group that I routinely take part in.  A group where I can go and share concerns that are on my heart (in however vague of terms).  I'm discovering that I miss it quite a bit.  This fall I hope to join a small group again.  Just thinking about it, though, sets my head to spinning.  There are several different options and I don't really know which way to go.  I almost want to pin the options on a wall and throw a dart at it, praying that God will direct the dart to the small group He wants me to be a part of.  Kinda like when they casted lots to see who would do certain jobs or receive certain items.

Some days I strongly dislike how indecisive I can be."

"event","So, today was my half-birthday.  It was a fairly good day overall, nothing spectacular happening but nothing horrible either.  I decided that I couldn't stand being in the office any longer around the time of my lunch break and went and grabbed some lunch.  After I went through the drive-thru, I was debating about what to do with my food.  And then it dawned on me...Picnic!  It was a beautiful day outside, I could lay out the sleeping bag I keep in my car and read my book when I was done eating.  As I was sitting there eating, I began thinking about how it's been a long time since I've just gone to a park to hang out.  Normally when I go to a park, I've gone for a walk or was doing some couch to 5K training.  Very rarely have I gone to a park lately without an agenda of some sort in mind--mainly to pass through.

It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy the things that I see at the park--I love watching the trees as they've been budding, leaves developing, animals going through various stages of growth, etc...In fact, those are the reasons I choose to go to a park rather then exercise indoors.  But, it's been so long since I've sat in one spot and just enjoyed.

My picnic today was my way of stopping and enjoying.  :)

Incidentally, today was National Picnic Day (at least according to <a href=""http://www.hungrygirl.com"">Hungry Girl.com</a>...and no, I didn't find that out until I read my e-mail this evening).  It also happened to be my half-birthday and the day that <i>Toy Story 3</i> was released into theaters."

"event","So, today was an overall pretty good day.  I ended up going to the doctor to talk about my knee issue and an allergy issue.  Pretty much told me what I already knew--I need to see a specialist for each of hte issues.  He recommended talking to a physical therapist about the knee issue--specifically about strengthening the muscles around the knee to help provide better support and help for bearing weight.  The allergies--well, he thinks I should see an allergist.  Not so sure how I feel about that, but I can't say it was entirely unexpected.

He also recommended I start taking some glucosamine in order to help with whatever inflammation might be happening.  I'm thinking that before I run out and hunt some down, I'm going to talk to whatever physical therapist I end up speaking with.

Been considering doing a 31-day challenge with my gym during the month of July.  I thought it might be a bit more of a stretch and perhaps light a fire under my bum that I've been lacking.

I was surprised with a visit from my brother, sister-in-law and my nephew Max.  It was great fun getting to chat with Alisha, have fun with Max (he's at such a great age right now) and watching my brother mow the lawn.  We wrapped things up by playing a few rounds of Mario Kart and dinner.

Totally made up for the disappointing doctor's visit.

Here is a small sample of my whirlwind of a nephew's visit

And when I say ""small"", I do mean small.  It's amazing how much of a mess such a little person can make.

Funny how, as the little person becomes a big person, the messes just get bigger.  ;)

P.S.  I'm working on getting back into the swing of things with blogging for my Project 365.  Don't be surprised if a whole pile of backdated entries start appearing :)  I have been taking pictures and uploading them to Facebook, but have been negligent about posting here (obviously, since the last entry was from February 24)."

"event","Today I had a couple of epiphanies while at work. The first has to do with some things that have been going on in the office. Basically, we have a big ol' tax filing deadline coming up (we file on behalf of our clients). There are a bunch of new procedures in place because the government is requiring that everything be filed electronically. This means a whole bunch of things, the largest obstacle being having software that will create and upload the information to the correct servers. Add to that the fact that the owners of the company are now on vacation for two weeks and have been trying to cram as much as they could into the last couple of weeks and you get one rather stressful office. 

That being said, a phrase that I have been hearing quite frequently has been ""Yeah, but what if...."" It's like they're trying to tackle every conceivable scenario and address them before they actually happen. The owner of the company actually said something about not wanting to be three years down the road and having something that was done even remotely wrong coming back to bite us. 

Now, to me, it seems like three years down the road is not something that we need to be concerned about. But maybe I'm weird because I'm outside of the situation. 

Here's the deal, though. My co-workers are so trapped in the land of ""What-if's"" that they can't seem to move beyond that to enter in to the land of ""What-can-actually-be-done-now
"". What I mean to say is that they're letting their fear of the future not allow them to actually focus on things in the present that they can control. 

I find that, so often in life, I'm in that very same position. I get so focused on things that (in all likelihood) will not happen that I forget to actually live in the moment. I forget to be present in the present. And by doing so, I miss out on so many opportunities that can be had. 

One of the key things that has been happening to me is I keep asking myself a question that one of the contestants on the Biggest Loser asked. ""What if I can't do this?"" And I love her mom's response to that question ""Yeah, but what if you can?"" 

That's the attitude that I want to face life with. Instead of focusing on the potential for failure, I want to focus on the potential for success. It starts with small, achievable goals and snowballs from there. I'm already doing far more than I ever thought I would. And now is my chance to do even more than that. 

The other epiphany that I had earlier today was that eating is meant to be a supremely pleasurable thing. It's one of the few activities where all 5 senses get involved at the same time. You see some lovely arrangement of food, you can smell it cooking, you can feel the texture of the food as it is picked up by your hands or rolls around in your mouth, you can hear the noise it makes as you bite into it and chew it, and (of course) you get to taste it. 

We are not meant to feel guilty for eating, but at the same time we are not meant to enjoy eating so much that we indulge in it far too often. It is not meant to become a crutch to lean upon and make us feel better when we are blue, angry, stressed, what have you. 

It is simply meant to be enjoyed and experienced in a complete and unique manner.

A photo of Max & I attempting to go down the slide.  Dad and I were watching Max for a bit while Bryan & Alisha were on a date.  We decided to head on out to the new park that is in our neighborhood.  I have a feeling that this is going to be a whole lot more fun after Max is climbing around on his own more.  Currently, he's more of a crawler.  He'll walk, but only if you're holding on to his hands and help balance him.

Gotta say, it gets pretty rough on the back."

I was privileged to take part in the dedication of Marnee & Tony's baby boy Daniel to the Lord.  It was a great little ceremony, although I've determined that the pastor who was praying over everyone needs to learn the art of more ""efficient"" prayer.  Daniel kept trying to interrupt him as he was speaking.  We've determined that he's going to be a charismatic and/or a preacher himself.  He just can't seem to stay quiet when everyone else is.

Afterwards, Nathan, Marnee, Tony, Daniel and myself headed on over to Applebee's for some great dinner and fun times.  We then went over to Marnee & Tony's place to play a few rounds on the Wii.

Overall, it was a great experience followed up with lots of laughs and fun."

I love Famous Dave's, and restaurants like it.  I love it when they poke fun at themselves and have what I like to call ""spunk"".  Makes eating that much more enjoyable.  :)  And it's nice to know that you don't have to take yourself seriously when eating something incredibly messy, like ribs and bbq."

Success!  My vegetables are starting to look almost as colorful as my fruits!  I'm very proud of this because this was something I wasn't so sure I can accomplish.  Eating a different vegeetable each week has proven to me that my tongue can be trained (to a degree...no cauliflower or broccoli still for this gal) to tolerate and even enjoy different vegetables.  The food for the weeks looked like this:

Week 1: Cucumbers
Week 2: Tomatoes (we're still working on this one, although it's heaps better than it used to be)
Week 3: Celery
Week 4: Radishes (still not sure about this--even after washing they taste too much like dirt...but I could just have a bad bunch).

So yay for enjoying (as Luisa put it) more of God's beautiful bounty!"

The passage that we read through at reGeneration tonight.  It was pretty cool to listen to a bit of an explanation on what the purpose of each piece of the armor of God does and why it's necessary.

The overall point that night was that the entire ensemble was meant to be for offensive use (except for the shield), not defensive use.  Pastor Mark made the point that none of the armor that we are given is meant to protect our backs--in fact, some of the pieces (like the shoes) would impede you from retreating and heading backwards.

Just thought that was an interesting thing to contemplate.  :) I'll be focusing on that passage in my Bible reading within the next couple of weeks and I'm sure that will be running through my mind."

And it was a tasty cake, btw.  The filling was actually some white icing mixed with a jar of strawberry freezer jam.

Yum!

Happy birthday, Kerrin!

Kerrin had graciously agreed to let us have our monthly movie night on her birthday, so long as we watched an episode of Fraggle Rock that night.  In the past few months, we've seen:

~ <i>It Happened One Night</i> (starring Clark Gable)
~ Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Rear Window</i>
~ <i>Millions</i> (a modern British movie that was interesting, to say the least)
~ The classic <i>Citizen Kane</i>

And this month's feature?  Here's a hint:


<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/maampeppy/pic/0004bxep/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/maampeppy/pic/0004bxep/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Yup, it was a Marx Brothers movie--<i>Duck Soup</i>, which was actually pretty funny but I don't think I could handle more than an hour of the Marx Brothers--it's hard to follow sometimes and the jokes got to be a bit old.  But, overall it was a fun movie that I'd be willing to see again.

The movie nights are a pretty cool deal.  Once a month a group of us get together at Chris' house.  He picks the movie that we'll be watching and gives us a brief synopsis in our invite.  Once there and settled in with our popcorn, Chris begins by introducing our cartoon(s) for the night.  The first night we met, we actually were introduced to the safety measures that people were supposed to implement should there be a nuclear fallout (very appropriate, given the area we live in).

I felt much more prepared after learning that all I would need to do is run for the nearest shelter and duck and cover my neck.  ;)

Usually the cartoons have a purpose, we get a bit of a history lesson about what an impact that particular cartoon had or some insights into why it was such a big deal.  The same goes for the movies, although that description is usually more in depth (but that could just be a reflection of the length of time in a movie vs. a cartoon).

This week we watched two cartoons that were released in the time frame that <i>Duck Soup</i> was originally released (the 1930's, during the Depression).

The first one was one I'd seen before called ""Flowers and Trees"" by Walt Disney.  The big deal about this cartoon was that it was released in technicolor--no other cartoons (at that time) were done in technicolor.  Turns out Disney actually ended up buying the rights to the process that Technicolor used and didn't really share those techniques with other studios.

Chris explained a bit of the process for shooting in Technicolor.  He said that there would be three different cameras shooting what was being filmed.  Within each camera was a prism that would break up all of the light flooding the scene into a specific color (red, blue, or green).  The information from each of hte cameras would be recorded onto three separate pieces of film and then somehow seamed together into one single strip that would show all of the colors blended together.

Pretty cool, no?

The next cartoon that was shown was released the same year as <i>Duck Soup</i>, 1933.  It was Disney's version of <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>.  This cartoon wasn't much of anything to Disney at the time--cartoons for the most part had a fairly short shelf life.  But this particular cartoon was so popular with the masses that in some places it stayed as long as 18 months.

When people would go to the theater, they would go just to see that cartoon--not necessarily the feature film that would be playing later.  At the time, you didn't have things like YouTube or movies that were sent to DVD within a few months.  If you wanted to see these things, you HAD to see them in the theater.

THe big draw was the song that was made so popular at that time ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?""  Chris said that people related to the characters of the three little pigs at the time because it was largely those who were looking to make a quick and easy buck, who spent a lot of their time in leisurely pursuits that were affected.  They were learning through the Great Depression that hard work was really the only way to persevere in tough times, to overcome the Great Depression (much like the pig who built his house of bricks).

So that was our little history lesson (well, a portion of it).  What was pretty cool was that in the movie we were watching, one of the characters even whistled a part of the tune for ""Who's Afraid of the Bigd Bad Wolf"".

P.S.  The ""cigar"" I was holding was actual an Oreo stick.  It had a cookie outside with what I later discovered was a white chocolate-type filling (it was hardened, not soft like the cream filling of an Oreo).

It made for a great straw in my milk.  ;o)

"event","Yesterday I ended up spending most of the day at the doctor's office.  I went to bed with a pain in my side and woke up with pain in my side (although it had increased somewhat and had changed to making me nauseous when it would twinge).  So, to the doctor's I went where I was poked, prodded, drained of some blood, and then gooped up for an ultrasound.  Turns out that, other than pain, I'm perfectly fine.  They can't find any reasons for me to be in pain--no cysts, kidneys appear to be okay, yada yada yada.

These are some of the guys from Garage Voice, a band that came through and played at a local coffee shop.  It was pretty cool getting to see them again--I had fun hanging with Leslie and Nathan.  The last time I saw them, it was at Hastings in Richland a couple years ago.  Tom, the lead singer, was ordered to be on vocal rest--meaning he couldn't sing a note.  They had one of the other guys (his name escapes me at the moment, sorry!) do the singing instead, but it wasn't quite the same.  They did mix it up a bit with a bunch of instrumental selections instead of more of their songs where Tom would have had to strain his voice.

This time around, though, much more fun and better.  They're really down-to-earth guys who love all kinds of interesting things (like Justice League and homemade mocassins).

Opening up for them was this neat guy, Adam Pasion.  He had some interesting stories to tell (and a very talented banjo player backing him up).  He said he was half-white, half-filipino, raised in California, but in love with bluesgrass music.  Seemed like an interesting combination."

The sun and clouds were doing amazing things while my local Spark team teamed up with one of the local Team in Training teams for our Saturday morning walk/jog.  I couldn't resist taking a picture.  :)"

Me, in front of the restaurant Dad and I tried out for dinner tonight.  It was a pretty interesting place (albeit loud).  It's basically and ""extreme"" burger joint.  They do offer other things like salads and sandwiches, but be forewarned that they're all pushed to the limits.  Reading through the list of foods that are offered with the different choices, it can be overwhelming.  As I was reading through the ingredients that are piled on top of some of the salads, I was having trouble breathing because I was too busy claculating the calorie count that I would be intaking if I ate even a quarter of the salad.

But, it turns out that the portion sizes were not as large as I feared, which helped considerably.

I ended up having a honey mustard chicken dish, which wasn't really noteworthy, but I would be okay with having again.  Perhaps without the cheese on it, though.

Oh yeah, if you're lactose intolerant, make sure to let them know because almost every dish has cheese (and lots of it).

While we were reading over the menu, there was one item that caught our eye.  It was the food challenge that the restaurant had.  If you're able to eat the items below (brought to you on a pan the size of a large pizza and piled about 16 inches off the table) within the time allotted (30 minutes), you can get a free t-shirt and your picture on the ""Wall of Fame"".

So what all do you have to eat?

3 1/2 lb hamburger patties (with cheese and one hamburger bun)
4 grilled cheese sandwiches
12 pieces of applewood-smoked bacon
Brisket (not sure how much)
Onion rings (not sure how much)
Chili (again, not sure how much)

And the final kicker:

3 (count them, 1...2...3!) pounds of French Fries.

We were speculating as to who would be crazy enough to try this challenge out, let alone actually succeed.  We even tried figuring out the calorie count.  I estimated a rather conservative 4,000-5,000 calories.  Oh no, not even close.

The count was well over 10,000 calories.

Yup, that's right...you too can attempt to eat 5 days worth of calories in only 30 minutes.

While we were pondering such lofty matters, I started looking around and realized something.  There was a news crew there at the restaurant.  I thought they were just doing a piece about the restaurant.  Oh no, they weren't doing just any old piece--the two news anchors who were present (both men in their early twenties) were there to do the challenge.

They didn't make it.

But, they did do a bit of live coverage while we were there, talking about how much they were actually able to make it through.  They ended the shot with a pan around the restaurant, showing my dad and the back of my head.  I deliberately did not look at the camera.

Dad was joking around about setting the Tivo to record the late night news.  We ended up going home and recording the opening ceremonies for the Olympics.

Or what we thought was going to be the opening ceremonies.

Gotta love miscommunication between the broadcasting network and the people who post the program schedule on Charter as well as Tivo.

The ceremonies didn't start until about 9 o'clock that night, 4.5 hours after they were supposed to start.  But, the Tivo had been recording since 4:30 that afternoon.

As I was watching the program the following day, I just started laughing when the 5 o'clock news came on.  Lo and behold, the beloved news crew was on, talking about the challenge they were about to embark on.  I watched the clip, zipped through to the six o'clock news and saw my dad and I at the end of the clip.

Yup, the back of my head had it's 2-5 seconds of fame.  ;o)"

"event","It's been unseasonsably warm here, as it has been in much of the pacific northwest.  To the point where not only are the birds and other animals confused about what time of year it is (I've seen a number of quail and robins bustling around), but the plant life is as well.

Some flowers that were planted near one of the hotels along the path that I was walking going from one park to the next.  I couldn't resist the beautiful raindrops on the petals--that's always been one of my favorite sights.

The beautiful fruit salad that I've been munching on at work.  Yum!!!  I just loved the mixture of colors that it had (not to mention the fabulous taste). :)

Eating fruit has never really been a problem for me--I still have to make a conscious effort to choose fruit over other things, but I definitely have an easier time eating fruit than I do eating vegetables.

For some reason, vegetables have never really appealed to me.  Perhaps I have more of a sweet tooth than I thought (although some of the fruits I like can be sour or bitter)

So, for the month of February one of the challenges I have placed before myself is to eat a different vegetable each week.  For this week, I'm focusing on tomatoes.  Last week I was focusing on cucumbers and had some success.  In fact, I was so successful that I came to the realization today that I didn't want to stop eating my cucumbers in order to eat more of my carrots.

It was a huge milestone for me.  And it's an encouragement to know that this challenge is a successful one.

We'll see if I feel the same way about tomatoes this time next week."

My lovely new fitness tool--the Nike+ chip.  It's a pretty cool little device that connects wirelessly to your iPod and keeps track of things such as your pace, time, and the distance you have traveled.  You can upload your stats to the Nike+ website when you sync your iPod.  On there, you can find challenges and training regimes that you can do as well.

Like I said, it's a pretty fun little toy!

And no, it doesn't normally sit on top of my toe like that.  I normally wear it under my shoelaces, where it's far more secure.  If I had the special Nike+ shoe, there is a cutout inside of the shoe, right under the arch of the foot, where the chip would go when it was in use.

Somehow buying the special shoes seemed to be going a bit too far.  ;o)

This, by the way, was my reward for meeting (and in some cases exceeding) my goals for the month of January."

It's not all that unusual to see ducks or even the occasional goose out there.  As I was walking along, admiring the ducks that were playing around in the water, all of a sudden I noticed something that was very un-duck-like.

My first-ever muskrat!  At least, that's what Dad and I identified it as later that night when I got home and was talking to him about it.  All I really knew for sure was that it wasn't a beaver and it wasn't an otter.

I zoomed in on the picture while it was still on my camera and walked out to show it to my dad.  At the same time, he was walking towards me with his iPhone in hand.  What cracked me up was his picture was the mirror image (although quite a bit brighter) of my own.  :)"

Today was, of course, Super Bowl Sunday.  Instead of going over to a friend's house and watching the game, or skipping out entirely and going to a movie, I ended up sticking around the house and having some fun times with my family!

There was playful bantering going on about who we thought was going to win.  We watched the ads, of course...and decided that none of them really ""wowed"" us.


And because I loved these pictures...

I knew I could do it. I mean, I've tried before and I did all right for a bit (running on a treadmill). This time it was outside (treadmills just kill my ankle that I sprained awhile back, not to mention triggering my vertigo). I don't think I've run outside since...oh wait, I was about to lie. I did jog a bit at one of the walks that we did last year with my local team. But, it wasn't for an incredibly long time (not that this was all that long, either). 

I haven't consistently run outside since I was in high school. A freshman in high school. Which was...um...13-14 years ago.

Look at me, I'm a blur! heehee! 

It was great because there were all of these fun songs coming on my iPod. The one that cracked me up the most came on towards the end of my workout, during the last rep that I was doing. ""Hunk of Burnin' Love"" as performed by Wynona Judd. 

The part that cracked me up was I was jogging, feeling my temperature rising and I was just noticing that. Right as I was thinking about how I was getting warmer, Wynona came over singing ""I feel my temperature risin'..."" Then, as I was trying to focus on my breathing towards the end of the final one-minute jog, she came over singing ""My chest just starts a-heavin'..."" And I couldn't help but laugh again. 

It was a fun way to end my workout. 

And, when I got home, there was a happy little present sitting in my mail box!

This, my friends, is what is known as a Nike+ iPod. It's a little adapter that plugs into your iPod that receives a wireless signal from the orange, oval Nike+ chip. 

Now, if you had the special Nike+ shoes, there is a little divot cut into the shoe, hidden under the inner sole right around the arch of the shoe. Since my shoes are not Nike+ shoes they have no special little dip for my chip. (heehee, couldn't resist, everyone's been talking about food for SuperBowl parties). At any rate, Nancy-Girl keeps hers tucked under her laces and I thought I could do very much the same thing. 

I only managed to turn it on and play with it for a few minutes--I haven't done any actual walking or anything with it. Saturday will be the test, as I'll be walking with my local Spark team at the mall AND also doing Day 2 of C25K. 

I took a look at the program that nikerunning.com has for doing a 5K and it's really not somehting I'm capable of at this point--it assumes you're already running on a regular basis (which I'm not...yet). But, they do have a program for beginning runners that I had put on my iPod. It's a combination of walking and running that will get you to the point of running 25 minutes within 12 weeks. 

For now, I'm sticking with the C25K program, which puts me at running a 5K in 8 weeks (right around the time that I will be doing the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure)."

But, I'm sure she has an amazing history of her own, even if she wasn't a part of our family history prior to Mom buying her.  :)"

My mommy and I ended up watching the Grammy awards tonight (intentionally waited to watch--there is a reason we Tivo the show).  Some crazy-looking things happened.  We ended up skipping most of it and watched a few of the performances.  Dave Matthews Band was by far my favorite.  Didn't get a glimpse of Matthew West or Mandisa there, but it's all good.

So why the 3-D glasses?  They were doing a special presentation to honor Michael Jackson and it was supposed to be in 3-D.  I found out when Dena and I went to Target on her birthday and they handed over a set of glasses to each of us.  I was glad I wasn't the only one wearing them tonight, and then (towards the end of the presentation), they were showing people in the audience and a whole bunch of the stars were wearing the glasses, too.  Kinda cool.

Truthfully, there wasn't a whole lot that actually appeared to be 3-D, but that could have just been our TV (it is a little older)."

Dad and I ended up going to a 1940's musical revue this afternoon.  It was neat to hear some great tunes from the 40's and hear some of the stories from people who were alive then.

Didn't turn out as well as I had hoped, but here's my ticket for the show tonight with the stage in the background (didn't want to alert crowd control to my camera's presence by using the flash). We saw and heard Hal Holbrook recite essays and snippets from Mark Twain's writings. The man is 84 and I was impressed with... his ability to fit the character and recite such long monologues. Apparently he's been at this since 1957.  I thought of <lj user=""bluesgirly""> and her love for Mark Twain."

Today was <lj user=""ilikesongs"">'s birthday!  She had the day off from work and I had my half-day, so we spent the afternoon and evening together celebrating her birthday in different ways.  First, we started with lunch at Olive Garden (yummmmmm!), then we went to her house for a bit before heading out to get her a free strawberry italian soda from a coffee shop that a friend of hers opened up recently.  After that, it was off to run some miscellaneous errands and then back to her house for dinner.  Pigs in a blanket (breakfast sausages wrapped in crescent rolls), green beans, and some hashbrowns.  Tasty stuff!

After that, we went and picked up Rochelle and were off to a Mary Kay special night that was going on.  The featured event was ""Steamy Spa"" facials.  It was nice to spend a little time tonight getting pampered, laughing with Rochelle about the different things that happened.

I kicked butt at the purse game.  They were trying to spell out an acronym (Mrs. Cab) and for each letter, we had to find an item in our purse that began with that letter.  It helped that Dena coached me for part of it.  ;o)

The gal that was leading that particular game was mixing up the letters (or so Dena said).  I told her at least she wasn't spelling Ms. Crab.  Then later I thought of another acronym that could be spelled out: Mr. Scab.  I could have all kinds of fun with a game like that, so I'm going to stop for now.

Overall, a good day spent with a dear friend having lots of laughs and making some great memories.

Happy birthday, <lj user=""ilikesongs"">!"

So tonight I bring you the moon.  Now this would normally not be such a wonderfully exciting thing, but this week has been nothing but grey skies, dreary, drizzly, damp, and (in general) depressingly cold.  But, tonight as I was driving over to a friend's house for a meeting, I spied a glimmer of hope.

No, it wasn't the sun peeking through the clouds.

It was the moon!  And it wasn't truly peeking through the clouds.  It was sitting in the ealry evening sky, in a clearing, perched as though waiting for something to happen.  Just the sight of the moon lifted my spirits tonight and gave me hope that perhaps, come 5:30 tomorrow morning when I arise, the sky will have completely cleared and I can enjoy a lovely walk.

Only time can tell.

In other news, I had a bit of a revelation earlier today while reading <i>Touch the Top of the World</i>.  Erik was descirbing some experience that he had with climbing Mt. Everest and something about what he was describing totally resonated with me.  Well, a lot of what he had to say resonated with me (I absolutely LOVED this book, FYI), but he was describing something in particular about the feeling he had completing a certain portion of Everest.  And what he had to say about it seemed familiar, but I couldn't quite put a finger on it.  I have never gone mountain climbing before (heights are one of my biggest struggles...and now, to know the wear and tear it can take on the body, I think I'm keeping my feet firmly planted on terra firma).  At any rate, I have never gone mountain climbing before, but the feeling he had touched me and reminded me of something I felt fairly recently.  It was a sense of accomplishment, but also a resignation that the journey was not over quite yet.  See, with mountain climbing, it's one thing to reach the true summit of the mountain.  It's another thing entirely to get back down safely.

And it reminded me of Bloomsday, a 12K race I completed last year.  Now, this is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill race.  It's a pretty big to-do over here in the Pacific Northwest.  I didn't realize just how flat my little area of Washington was until I completed this race (college life in Pullman had only given me glimpses of that idea).  There is one particular section called ""Doomsday Hill"".  It's a hill at a fairly steep incline that lasts for approximately one mile.  And after reaching the crest of the hill, you have a full 2.5 miles to go to complete the race.  Yes, you're two-thirds through the race...but you still have that last one-third to go.

The last third isn't really all that tricky or anything, but it's still a part of finishing the race and finishing it well.  And that's something I would like to do this year--not just finish the race, but finish it well.

A friend of mine on <a href=""http://www.sparkpeople.com"">SparkPeople.com</a> is calling 2010 the ""Year of Completion"".  For me, it's not just a year of completing things, but also of starting new things--like taking up running or tackling the tricky task of getting myself to eat more veggies on a regular basis.

But ultimately, regardless of the goals, I would love to see the smaller steps taken towards completing those goals completed and completed well by the end of the year.

So far, so good.  Nearly one month down and 11 more months to go!"

The picture for today was in honor of the drizzly weather we've been having.  I ended up crashing last night around 7, waking up at 12:30, going back to sleep at 12:45, and then waking up again only when my alarm went off at about 5:30.  I finally got my rear out of bed around 6 and went for a 3-ish mile walk around the neighborhood.  The walk took me past several places I haven't been to nor really thought about in months.  It was kind of fun getting to relive my past--like my middle school (which we affectionately termed the little stone jail).

It was also a bit emotional as I was walking past my middle school.  I was facing the field where I first experienced running a mile.  That was not such a pleasant experience, from a difficult time in my life (lol, but who doesn't have a difficult time at that age?).  And I think that it really set the tone for how I faced fitness to follow.

At this time, I can't pinpoint anything that specifically happened.  I just know that it was during this time I learned to hate running.

And now, 15+ years later, I'm trying to learn how to like running.

At this point, I'm actually excited for next Tuesday to come along so that I can start the Couch to 5K program.  I think part of it is trying something new, but on the other hand I keep thinking of all the opportunities this can open up and I'm excited to see where it (literally) takes me."

The movie I've been watching the last few nights when falling asleep.  I was inspired to watch it after going to the hockey game on Friday night.  Then the last couple of days I've been hearing bits and pieces about the winter Olympics coming up in February.  Add the two together and I couldn't resist any longer.  :)"

You know, it's hard being a girl who is allergic to perfumes.  It makes me sad sometimes that I don't get to use the lotions and everything else (like bubble baths and aromatherapy) that other people get to use for fear that my skin will itch like crazy (or worse, break out in a rash).  For years I tried to find a fragrance free version of bubble bath, but had no luck. Until one day when I happened to be going down the kid aisle at the grocery store and spied the bottle above (well, not that exact one, but one just like it).  It's fragrance-free bubble bath made by none other than Mr. Bubbles himself.  It is so nice to be able to climb into the bathtub when I want to take a bubble bath now and not have to worry about itching for hours afterwards.

Much like I did tonight.  Didn't really have a reason to take one, other than it sounded good and I had a good book I wanted to spend some time reading.  So that's exactly what I did.  Mmmm...pleasant way to spend some time this evening, I promise you that.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for length"">The book I was reading was one I had posted briefly about a couple weeks ago--<u>Touch the Top of the World</u> by Erik Weihenmayer.  It's about Erik's life as he goes through the process of becoming blind and learns how to deal with it in a seeing world.  I love the book, it's inspiring (a word he hates to see in relation to himself because he says he's just a normal guy doing normal things).  He's got a lot of interesting points in the book, but one of the things he talks about (quite a bit) is limitations--limitations placed on us by ourselves and by others.  And he talks about how he dealt with some of those limitations--to the point of being able to climb Mt. McKinley (among other mountains).

I'm constantly surprised at the imagery he describes in there, scenery, movements and facial expressions, all things I take for granted.  He wasn't born blind--it was something that he became after being born with a genetic disorder that affected his eyes.  I suppose that helps him with describing things, having been able to see for quite some time--although it was with some difficulty.

One of my favorite quotes (thus far):

<i>Some guy told me I need to realize my limitations.  I think too many people sit around realizing their limitations when, maybe, they should spend more time realizing their potential.</i> (p. 181)

Reading that tonight got me to thinking about the limits I place on myself.  And yeah, there are limits that are placed their for a reason.  But there are limits that I place on myself that are only hurting me, not helping me.  He spoke of this gal that he met in college who was blind as well.  She had this dream of becoming the first blind talk show host on TV.  But, when given the opportuntiy to work as an intern for a talk show (the perfect stepping stone for her career), she turned it down after she was told that she could not bring her guide dog in because they were afraid it would disturb the current host's dog (a little yappy thing).

Erik expressed frustration on her behalf and determined to live his life in a manner different than her own--fighting for his own right to fit in with the seeing world (because really and truly, he is part of that world) and helping people see that blindness is not the handicap that a lot of people (himself included) imagine it to be.

I, too, don't want to impede my own progress.  I want to step out there and do something grand (no clue what, but that's not the point).  I want to dream big and follow that dream.  But the limitations I place on myself are things that I'm going to have to overcome.

Today at church we were singing a couple of different songs--one was ""Overcome"".  I love the song and it got me to thinking about the weight loss journey that I'm on.  Really what the journey is about is me finding the freedom to live life the way God intended--and what that looks like.  But to do so, I have to overcome some difficulties and challenges in my life (including addictions to things like food).

One of the things that I've come to realize lately is that I've been neglecting God's role in this whole journey.  Because He is there and is responsible for my progress--whether I acknowledge Him or not.  A lot of times this journey can seem like a solitary one.  I alone choose the food that goes into my mouth.  I alone choose to get up early in the morning to exercise.  I alone choose what particular form of exercise I will be partaking in for that day.  I choose the program I'm going to follow.  I, I, I.

But the truth is, it's not just my decision to make.  There is someone else involved in these decisions, giving me the strength to make them and stick with them. And I would be sorely mistaken if I did not acknowledge His role in this journey.

Especially considering that this journey is not just a physical one.  It is emotional.  It is spiritual as well.

I've been reading in this book called <u>The Passion of Jesus Christ</u> by John Piper.  It is 50 reasons why Christ came and died for our sins and what that means for us.  Each week I pick a chapter and read that chapter over the course of the week (the chapters are only 1-2 pages long).

This past week, the first few lines of the chapter stood out to me.  It was talking about how frustrated we get with the slowness of change--particularly with the time that it takes to make us become more Christ-like.

And yes, I understood what John Piper was talking about there.  But so much of it relates to the weight loss journey I'm on.  It's a slow process.  And it's a rough one at times.  It's frustrating to be in the middle of it and see the potential that lies there, to be doing everything you can to achieve something, but not be able to meet that goal for one reason or another.

One of hte things that he said we need to realize is that we are both ""sanctified"" and ""being perfected"" at the same time.  That means that we are considered righteous, but we're also becoming more and more righteous each day.  It's an interesting thought, one that turns my mind inside out.

The same can be said of me and this healthy lifestyle.  I have a healthy lifestyle (I do get out and exercise, I make healthy decisions for eating, etc...) but at the same time, I am learning how to live a healthy lifestyle (choosing whole grains whenever possible, eating a large salad before diving into dinner, etc...).

To get back to what Erik was saying about not holding yourself back, I came to the realization tonight that I was holding myself back from something.  I was keeping myself from signing up for Bloomsday, using the excuse that I didn't have anyone to walk with me (my Bloomsday buddy recently had knee surgery and it doesn't look like she's going to be able to join me).  I was also using the excuse that I didn't have the finances.

But the truth of it is, I was fighting with my old self, my lazy self that would rather stay at home and watch movies all day than get out there and experience the world around me.  After giving my hesitation serious consideration, I determined that I was just limiting myself and there was no real valid reason that I couldn't do Bloomsday this year.  So I logged onto the site and signed up.

Something I'm going back to in order to not neglect God's role in this journey anymore is I'm going to be reading from ""Faithfully Fit"" by Claire Cloninger and Laura Barr.  It's a 40-Day devotional I started last year some time and never completed.  This time, I'm going to complete it.  I've even asked someone to join me in doing it.  I'll be reading this, partnered with <u>The Spark</u>.  After I finish <u>The Spark</u>, I think I'm going to start going through the workbook and book <u>Lose it For Life</u> by Steve Arteburn.  It's a 10-week program that takes you through several spiritual aspects, as well as the nutritional and physical aspects that go along with trying to lead a healthy lifestyle.

<i>Lord, thank You for being here for me on this journey, whether I acknowledge Your presence or not.  Help me to remember that it is by You that I will ultimately overcome these struggles--by Your strength and Your might.  Not by anything that I can do on my own.  Lord, help me to acknowledge and submit to Your authority over every morsel that passes my lips and every movement that my body makes on this journey.  Help me to give glory to You for every victory and praise You in the midst of defeat.  Thank You for what You have been teaching me thus far.</i></lj-cut>"

"event","<img src=""http://photos-ak.sparkpeople.com/9/7/b97667784.jpg"" width=350 height=262 title="""" align=""right"">Started off the day walking with my local Spark Team.  I actually end up walking with Marnee more than I walk with my actual teammates, but it's okay in some ways because I know that doing this on a weekly basis helps Marnee to be active and we get some talk time without having to worry too much about interruptions (other than the occasional time when her son leans too far forward and falls out of the stroller).  ;o)

Today was somewhat momentous for me--I actually started breaking in my new running shoes that I had bought about a year ago.

They're pretty snazzy, no?

Personally, I'm not a fan of the bright yellow, but when I tried them out about a year ago, they were the ones that were the most comfortable and I liked the best.  I was informed when I was shopping for them at the local running store to not be so concerned about fashion and more concerned about fit.  If that's the way it works in the world of runners, that explains so much.  ;o)

In other news, I decided that I would like to compete in the Disney Land or Disney World half or full marathon.  They also have a 5K version, which I think would be completely do-able.  The Disney Land one is taking place in September of this year.  The Disney World one is taking place in January of next year.  Right now, I'm going to kind of bide my time and see what happens as far as finances and other things (like starting up jogging) go.  If I do the 5K, I have to get my pace down to a 16-minute mile on average.  That means (at this point) I would have to jog at least 2 minutes out of every mile that I walk.

I went ahead and looked up some information on the local running group's website and found a 5K that I could totally do in March.  It's a St. Patrick's Day race--a 5K or a 10K.  I think it'd be a great time for me to put the C25K program into practice, seeing as I should be about halfway through the training at that point and time.

Speaking of which, I think I'm going to end up going for a walk tomorrow afternoon instead of resting because I didn't really get my full three miles in today like I had hoped.  We'll see how I'm feeling tomorrow, though.

Today was an overall good day.  I saw a three pound loss on the scale (almost made up for the 4 lb gain that I've experienced thus far this year), went to work and got paid (which is always nice), and then spent the evening with some friends at a hockey game.  It was a fun time and a pretty close game.  4-2, our favor (winning may not be everything, but it sure makes the game more enjoyable).  The team we were playing against were the Vancouver Giants.  Apparently we're not only top of our division, but top of our league as well.  Our opponents tonight were number 2 in the league, number 1 in their division (at least, that's my understanding of the rankings).  There was one fight, and one fight only (although someone tried to start something in the first period).  The first goal of the game was scored by us within the first minute.  And although we were denied our free burger from the local burger joint (our team has to score 5 or more goals in a home game), I feel like things worked out pretty well.  :)

And now, since I've been up since 5-ish this morning, I think it's beyond time for bed.  G'nite all!"

"event","So this morning I heard the same little blurb on the radio not once, but twice.  This gal was talking with the DJ's about positive talk.  Then tonight I went to look at the boot camp bonus challenge for the evening and I just had to laugh.  It was a challenge to do positive self-talk today.

Earlier I was wondering if perhaps I happened to be listening the radio both times when they aired that conversation for a reason.  Then I read that tonight and it was like God was saying ""See?  Don't get down on yourself!""

So the thing the gal was saying on the radio today (that I actually was planning on posting) was something that her grandmother would always tell her.  There were a couple of different things (and bear in mind that her grandma was SOUTHERN), like ""Don't you watch no so poppers.""  She said it took her years to figure out that her ""sweet molasses"" grandmother was trying to tell her this as she was watching ""Days of Our Lives"" or other similar shows and realize that she wasn't saying ""So Poppers"" she was actually saying ""Soap Operas"".

But there was something else her grandma used to tell her.  ""Now Jennifer, let the words of your mouth and the mediations of your heart be pleasing in God's sight.""  Which is a paraphrase of Psalm 19:14.

Let the words of my mouth
and the mediations of my heart
be pleasing in Your sight,
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

And she said that she's come to the realization that this isn't just talking about the things that you say outloud to others, but it's the things you also say to yourself.  That would be the whole ""meditations of my heart"" part of that particular verse.

The thing is, God not only doesn't like it when we speak ill of His other creatures, He doesn't like it when we speak ill of ourselves because we are one of His creations.  He wants us to see the good that He sees in us and to focus on that.  And yes, we do need to acknowledge that we have faults and are not perfect, but we can't let that be our focus.  The word ""meditation"" implies that we sit there and actually think about it, it doesn't just flit briefly through our mind.  Thoughts like ""You'll never be good enough!"" ""Can't you do anything right?"" have no place, not even a place of racing through there because if they spend too much time there, we'll start to feel defeated and start acting like those words.

The other thing this gal pointed out was that we're doing this to please God, not please ourselves (although, by pleasing God we often find that we, ourselves, are pleased, too).  And that it is important to remember that during those down times, God is our strength--He will give us the strength to combat those thoughts when they do come our way.  My added thought is that He's also our Redeemer--which means that if we do happen to sin in having those thoughts, if we come to Him with those thoughts, He will then take them and redeem them.  He will change our thinking to be far better than it really is.

As an added bonus, I wanted to share my photo of the day here from my walk earlier today:

This is the highly addictive, incredibly fun, and purely EVIL game that my sister-in-law encouraged my dad to download to his iPhone.  The game is called Traffic Rush (you can get it for free on the iPhone or the iTouch).  The basic premise is that you're helping guide all of the cars through the intersection and safely across to the other side.  You do so by tapping on the screen where the cars are pictured.  To get the cars to move more quickly through the intersection, you swipe your finger across the screen after tapping the car.  It sounds somewhat boring and a bit tedious--but holy freaking cow!  It's addictive.

Dumb little game, lol, kept Mom and I occuppied on Monday night for a good hour or so.  One person would play five games, then pass the phone off to the next person.  Back and forth like that until one of us called it quits because the other one was getting a bit violent.  Mom kept smacking the couch cushion that was between the two of us.  We both kept making really funny noises when the crash happened.

FYI: my best score so far has been 177.  My brother is up to 197.  The sister of my sister-in-law is up well above 600, the turkey. ;)"

Why is that such an exciting thing? Well, because there is an article about ""The Spark"" in it, in addition to some info about one of the gals I'm friends with on <a href=""http://www.sparkpeople.com"">SparkPeople.com</a>, Heather. Made me excited. :)  It's like I know someone famous, even though I don't *really* know her, outside of the cyber world.

It's one I took while I was on my walk during my lunch break. I walked twice today! I was going to get up and walk this morning, but I wasn't feeling so hot when my alarm first went off, so I climbed back into bed after resetting the alarm. Fortunately, it was a lovely (albeit cloudy) day today so I was able to go for a walk on my lunch break. After work, I met up with a few of my Spark team members (although my friend and I left them behind tonight when walking) and we went walking around the mall.

But, while I was on my lunch break this afternoon, I couldn't get over how amazing the water in the ditch that runs alongside the path looked when it was reflecting the sky and the bushes that are in the middle of it. So I took a picture, wondering if that was going to turn out. I think it actually turned out pretty cool, if I do say so myself.

I tried to get a picture of myself reflected in the water, but it was proving too difficult at the time, so I gave up and went ahead and settled for the other picture.   But, you know, in retrospect, I don't think I was really settling at all.  :)"

I decided I wanted to read something a bit more inspirational and was in the mood for a biography/memoir.  One of these days I'd like to read the one I got about Walt Disney, but this one appealed to me more right now.

<u>Touch the Top of the World</u> is about Erik Weihenmayer's journey to the top of various peaks, including Mt. McKinley and Mt. Everest.  I know that there have been a number of people who have made it to the top of both peaks and I myself don't really have a huge interest in rock climbing, mountain climbing, or climbing in general.  I guess, since I'm afraid of heights, it's never really appealed to me.

But this book got me curious. ""Why?"" you might ask.  Well, simply for the fact that this guy did all of these climbs...and he's blind.  Completely and utterly blind due to a degenerative disease that he had.

In the book, he talks about how he experiences the world by touching with his hands.  Hence why the book is called <u>Touch the Top of the World</u>, I suppose, instead of ""View from the Top of the World"" or something like that.

At any rate, he was talking about his father and what kind of man he was.  And he said that from the time he was young, instead of telling him fairy tales or ghost stories while sitting on his knee, his dad would tell him instead a poem that he loved called ""Don't Quit"".  The poem made such an impression on me that I wanted to post it here, to record it.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>Don't Quit</b>
<i>When things go wrong as they sometimes will,
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,
When the funds are low and the debts are high,
And you want to smile, but have to sigh,
When care is pressing you down a bit--
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.

Life is queer with its twists and turns,
AS every one of us sometimes learns;
And many a fellow turns about
When he might have won, had he stuck it out.
Don't give up though the pace seems slow--
You may succeed with another blow.

Often the goal is nearer than
It seems to a faint and faltering man;
Often the struggler has given up
When he might have captured the victor's cup;
And he learned too late when the night came down
How close he was to the golden crown.

Success is failure turned inside out--
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
And you never can tell how close you are,
It may be near when it seems afar;
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit--
It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.</i></div>

I don't know anything that expresses this weight loss journey in better terms than that.  It's an exhillerating and yet discouraging thing to do.  The pounds gained, the pounds lost, the inches gained, the inches lost, the times when the scale just won't budge, the time when you seem to be stuck in an eternal plateau...and yet, you never know when that breakthrough moment is going to happen--never know when that one extra step you take could be THE step that takes you over the line and suddenly you're experiencing all kinds of success.

Just wanted to offer some encouragement and share from the experiences of others."

Today is a rather boring day for me.  When I woke up this morning I was not feeling very well at all.  I've been light-headed off and on for the last couple of days.  The tipping point came this morning when I woke up and so I decided to get more rest and sleep in instead of heading off to church and doing everything else I had planned for the day.

My mommy is supporting me and being a good buddy by hanging out on the couch with me, watching the Bourne trilogy.  It's nice to have someone to sit next to when you're watching tv.  :)"

"event","Started the day off with a walk with my local team.  It was a good day to do some mall walking.  Even though Marnee & I got left in their dust, it was a good time to walk and talk.  And boy, did we have a good talk.  It was nice to get ourselves lost in conversation, even with her little boy around.

After that and a trip to Costco, she dropped me off and I ended up having lunch with my family.  My brother and sister-in-law left my nephew Max here and we ended up watching him for a few hours while they went grocery shopping.  I don't know what it is about watching him, but I usually end up taking a nap when we watch him on the weekend.

Of course, it could just be that I need to get some more sleep.

While he was here, we went ahead and set Max up on the Wii Fit Plus with his own little profile.  Here's a picture of him checking out his Mii.  It was too cute not to post.

Apparently, with Wii Fit Plus, you can set up a child as a player, but they can't actually do any of the games or a complete balance test until after they turn 3 years old.  But, you can have them weighed and measured, which is fun.  :)

To round out the day, I went to a friend's house where a group of us had some wonderful tortilla soup and watched ""Citizen Kane"" together.  It was an interesting movie.  It was a little frustrating to watch this time through because I knew what was meant by Mr. Kane's final words (which is the mystery of the whole movie).  I kept wanting to shout at the TV what the answer was, but we were asked to refrain from giving away the answer before the movie even started.

Oh yeah, and I managed to finish <u>There And Back Again: An Actor's Tale</u> by Sean Astin, who played Samwise Gamgee in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.  It was an interesting read, but it's not something I would really recommend to others.  The book itself was mostly about Sean's experiences and choices that led up to him getting the role and then (in my mind) the politics behind making movies.  He also had nothing but praise for the people he worked with (and rightly so), but at times it seemed too much.  And he chose to dwell on things that seemed rather random.

To be honest, I thought the book was going to be more of a behind-the-scenes, here are some of our experiences kind of book.  And to a degree, that was there, but it wasn't entirely what the book was about."

Back in December, my dad decided that he wanted to go to Bonefish Grill for his birthday dinner.  My grandma generously offered to pay for the meal for all of us and gave me the money to do so.  Being resourceful, I decided that I would go ahead and buy a gift card.  They had a deal going on at the time, spend so much on a gift card and you end up getting a bonus card worth $20.  What I didn't know at the time was the $20 gift card was actually not valid until January.

Fast forward to tonight.  Dad decided he wanted to use the card, so we ended up going to Bonefish grill for a *very* early dinner (around 4:30-5:00).  Went through the meal and I ended up going into the bathroom.  I was surprised to encounter the picture that is posted here when I went.

Yup, you see right.  In one of the stalls in the bathroom, they had a regular chair.  Not only that, they had 2 chairs in that particular stall (it was the handicapped one).  When you walk into the bathroom, there is yet another chair by the door.  And as you're walking to the bathroom, there are 2 chairs flanking a table up against the wall between the men's and women's restrooms.

Now, I don't know about you, but the idea of using a public restroom is enough to give me pause.  But, throw in a couple of chairs in the stall with me and the possibility of an audience sharing the stall.  Well..."

"event","So, today I was privileged to take my first outdoors walk of the year!  The sun was shining, it was a lovely 54 degrees (supposedly).  The breeze was...well, brisk, to put it mildly.  The tunes on my iPod were fantastic and I loved every minute of it.

Me, at the start of my walk.  As you can tell by my hair flying around, the breeze was going strong.

Some ducks bathing in the canal that runs alongside the walking path.  All told, I counted:

Cyclists - 3
Birds - 24 (including these ones. The racket they made was fantastic and filled me with so much hope of the promise of spring.  It's a shame it's only January, lol)
Other walkers - 2
Kids in Strollers - 1 (a beautiful 3 year-old girl who had a brilliant smile)

My turn-around point.  Even though my timer usually goes off a couple of minutes before I reach this point, I still push myself to walk to that point and turn around.  I even pat the center pole as I circle around it.  Somehow it makes me feel more accomplished (like crossing a finish line and breaking through the tape running across it...or breaking through the toilet paper stretched from tree to tree we used to mark the end of our races when we were kids).

A mile-marker for the path I was using.  And no, that's not how far I walked on the path.  I think (at most) I walked 1.5 miles round-trip.

A funky-looking cement truck that was driving down the road while I was walking.  It looks like the cab of the truck is actually in the back...it's a trip to see it drive down the road.

The gorgeous sun playing peek-a-boo with the clouds!  The temperature was supposed to be 54 degrees F (at least that's what Google claimed it was when I texted for the info while walking).  I don't know about that, but when the breezes died down enough, it certainly felt really pleasant.

As I was walking a song came on ""Deeper"" by Delerious.  One of the lines says ""It's time to walk the path where many seem to fall"".  At the time, I thought briefly about how this is a journey that many choose to embark on, but not everyone finishes strong.

I, for one, would like to finish strong.  And by taking a walk today, I know I (literally) took steps to do just that.

Our brand-spankin' new ""Received"" stamp at work.  We had to replace our old one when I discovered that it only went up through December 31, 2009.  Kind of a problem entering into 2010.

I love that the numbers we haven't used yet are still the same shade of gray as the rest of the rubber that makes the stamp.  The contrast between that gray and the red just caught my eye.

And yes, I'm a big enough nerd to admit that I love office supplies.  Particularly pens.  A friend of mine and I could spend a good couple of hours just wandering around Office Max checking out all of the pens."

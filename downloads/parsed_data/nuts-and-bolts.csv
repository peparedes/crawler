If I put away $300 a week I&#39;ll have enough to pay for everything that&#39;s left.

The honeymoon has been booked as well.
We&#39;re going to Niagara/Toronto for 7 days. So far planned, we&#39;re going to a Blue Jays game, Wonderland, CN tower, I bought a surprise helicopter tour hopefully Phil will like that, the maid on this mist, wine tours.&nbsp;
We&#39;re going to try and get on to watch Much Live but it says you have to be 18-28 and Phil is 29 lol. I don&#39;t know how much that really matters. It&#39;s not like he looks old.

We have put down our deposit for the florist. We went with Floral Fixx which was recommended as the #1 choice from my wedding planner co-worker. Working with someone who has done wedding planning is definitely helpful.&nbsp;

The flowers that will be used in my bouquet will be tiger lilies, roses, spotted orchids and a birds of paradise flower.
The bridesmaids will have only the roses and orchids.
The groomsmen, mothers, grandmothers, fathers, etc will all have combinations of the flowers as well.

Since leopard print is part of the theme I was hoping for spotted tiger lilies, but they apparently aren&#39;t available commercially. So that&#39;s where the spotted orchids come in to give more of a leopard look to the bouquets.

"event","&nbsp;I'm pooped.
I started taking shifts at Boston Pizza again since I live closer to Winnipeg and money is nice.&nbsp;

My car officially has been written off after weeks of MPI trying to make up their mind. Luckily I found a very similar car in yellow for only $400 more than what MPI is giving me for my old car. So I'm picking up the new beetle on Saturday. It has heated seats which make me happy, because heated seats rule.
It's a standard so I have to figure out how to drive it. I'll probably look like a tool for at least a week stalling my car. At least I don't live in the city and for the most part highway drive.

The money I'm using to buy the car is from money I had saved up to buy a boxer. I originally was told I was only getting $4600 for my car when they first told me it was written of, then they changed their mind and said it wasn't, then said it was again and are now giving me $5100. So, I have some extra money left over because I thought I would have to pay $900 for the new car I'm getting so I think I might go put a deposit down on a puppy that is ready to leave it's mommy in August.&nbsp;

Other than the car issue life is pretty much cruising along as usual. Working two jobs is giving me hope of paying off and cancelling one of my credit cards (I have two). So, that should be down with soon.&nbsp;

Then I'll find some other expense to put myself back in to debt with. Such as the huge list of things I want to do to the house.
I'm not really too concerned about being in debt, I pay my minimum payments so my credit rating isn't bad, and then one day I'll be dead and I won't have to pay back anyone. Whatever."

I've been working out lots lately, bought the Jillian Michaels ""win by losing"" DVD box set. They're pretty crazy. I also have been doing the elliptical for about 20-30 minutes a day on top of that.

"event","I wonder why I don't have any friends? 
I don't really have a best friend, or even any really tight friends. I have friends I've known forever and old work friends from boston pizza but I wouldn't call any of them my best friend. It came really clear once I moved who actually cared about me, which doesn't seem to be to many people. Friends I hung with multiple times a week while I lived in Winnipeg don't even attempt to contact me. I've tried to make plans with people and usually we do hang out if I'm coming in to the city but shouldn't a friend want to know whats going on and be in contact more than the occasional hang out that I usually arrange? I feel like I should just cut off all contact to these people, but then what? Try and make new friends? Luckily I've made friendships out of Phil's friends which is nice, but shouldn't I have my own friends? Is there a reason people don't like me? 
Maybe it's my age group. I'm not a big bar star, I work a real job, own a house, etc. Most people I know my age only care about getting drunk and laid. Whatever.

I guess for now my crew consists of Phil, Andy, Bruno, Kiwi, Artemis and Mimi."

"event","Phil and I are moved in to the new house.  There's still lots of work that needs to be done, but nothing really mandatory. I really want to do vinyl siding especially on the front of the house to just make it look more even. It'll also help with insulation since it's was pretty cold when we first moved in so I don't want to think about what it'll be like in -50 weather. 
The radio station is still not on air. I feel like they're not really working on this station too hard. It's like they keep opening new ones but don't bother to make the ones they already have any good. 
We'll see how it goes I guess. 
We have acquired another chinese crested named Andy. The plan was to give him to Phil's mom since she loves Bruno so much. They're totally different dogs though. Andy is much more in your face and high energy than Bru. 
Phil's dad really likes him though, so they're going to take him for a test run and if all goes well they'll keep him.
We plan on getting a boxer eventually maybe later this year or next year. It'll be nice having a big dog. They're so different than little guys. 
Phil got a job at the Viking in Gimli. He seems to be liking it, but we're back to not seeing each other that often any more since I work days and he works nights (was the other way around when I was bartending and he was working days.) But he's making good money and then we have time to miss each other so... it's all good. 
He said that once he pays his mom back for his truck he's going to buy me an engagement ring. So, we may be getting married in a year or two. 
It's crazy to think that I'm 21, own a house, live with the guy I'm most likely going to marry and work in the field I went to school for. It's pretty good.
I also live a 15 minute walk from the beach. I can't wait till it warms up so I can jump in the lake! 
I'm trying to cut off 20lbs before summer. Obviously not gonna lose that much weight in such a short period of time but I'm working on it. Exercising daily and trying to eat a lot healthier."

"event","&nbsp;Since I don't post very often, I probably should maybe that could be a new years resolution or something? But lots has happened over this year such as...
+Started at The Academy of Broadcasting in January, graduated in October.
+Bought Bruno, my lovely hairless dog in March.
+Started my half sleeve and finished most of it, just have to add the inside piece which probably won't happen till maybe next summer? Spent $1,100 on it so far.
+Phil and I moved in together in June and moved to Swan River together in November.
+Got a radio job right out of school in Swan River, which is where I am now. Started November 1st.

- Gained about 15lbs while being in school. I plan on getting a gym membership again (which I canceled once I started school because I had no time to use it.)&nbsp;
- Even though I'm happy about getting a job, living in a town with a population near 5,000 is weird and lonely. I'm very glad I have Phil with me.
- I miss serving and making tips. Even though my paycheque is larger (almost twice as much as my regular pay not including tips) than it was at Boston Pizza, I hate budgeting and I was so used to always having cash on me. I have to grow up I guess?

That's about all the big things that have happened to me during 2010. Bring it on 2011.&nbsp;
My goal for 2011 is to save enough to put a down payment on a small house or condo but it all depends if I stay in Swan River that long or get a job somewhere else. The media business if full of moving."

I have to get some decent quality ones that can work with audio equipment so we were looking around and I found some that looked like they'd do the trick for $40. My dad then finds some pink head phones for $80 and insists I get those ones instead basically just because they were pink. He was the one paying for them so I didn't really care if I'm going to get more expensive and pink headphones I'm in!&nbsp;
When we got back to my parent's place my mom asked how much they were and I said $80.&nbsp;
My dad then butts in claiming he wasn't going to buy me some crappy ones. I thought it was really funny because really he didn't look at anything else about the headphones besides the fact that they were pink.
Ah... I love my dad.

Schools still going good. Into week 2 of 36.&nbsp;
I'm starting to think more like a radio host.. trying to think of how situations that happen through my day can be turned into a story to say on the radio.
I'm trying to get a hold of someone at CKUW to do a show on the university channel with my pal Katie who goes to U of W.&nbsp;
They have a few openings and are apparently always happy to take on radio students because we actually know how to use the radio equipment and know how to put together a show better than some random university kid who wants to rant.
They have a show time open from 8-10pm on saturday night. I think it'd be fun to do some type of dance music &quot;pregame&quot; show.. all bar music requests.. etc. I'm trying to bust my ass these next few months so I can get an on air job right away.. ugh.. i don't want to have to do crap work once i'm done school lol.
That's all. Life is A-OK."

"event","&nbsp;One week down at ABC.
I'm really enjoying it so far and the homework has been nothing. I guess compared to having to study and do homework for university and labs it's nothing having a week to write a 3 page essay. I'm also certain that it won't be marked as hard compared to the way a prof would be marking it.&nbsp;
Most of all I enjoy being on air.&nbsp;
Brad (one of my teachers) let us go on air today and everyone was all scared. I got to go on during two breaks due to nobody wanting to talk. I think I'm going to start booking myself in for an hour at least once a week. Maybe even more. It's fun but also hard to always think of things to say and also not sound like you're on repeat or that you're a robot.&nbsp;
Obviously practice will help and since I enjoy doing it I won't mind coming in early to go on.&nbsp;
I originally went into this course thinking I'll try and go into TV but I think I might stick with the radio course. I have 8 weeks still to decide which side I'll specialize in but I kind of like sitting in a room talking to myself.. haha..."

"event","&nbsp;Today was my first day at Academy of Broadcasting..
There's about 25 people in my class so it's nice and small and I'm sure that once we split to do specializing that the group that is heading towards TV broadcasting will probably be 10 or less. Seems that most people are radio focused. Meh, It'll be better for me I'm sure.&nbsp;
Hopefully only 9 months and I'll be done with school, feels so much more motivating than the years I was planning to spend in university.&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;I'm back in school next week after a very short, 4 month break.&nbsp;
It went by too fast and I was way less productive during my break than I hoped to be.
I did buy a new laptop with the money I made during the break but didn't save enough for my trip so now I have to be super poor till I can afford to go away on spring break. It'll be worth it though.&nbsp;
I also hope I can go to the gym as frequently as I have been once i'm back in school. I'm still not quite where I want to be fitness wise.
Since my last update I've moved to broadway. So far pretty good here.&nbsp;
Minus the no parking and having to walk in the cold everywhere.&nbsp;"

I obviously did it to myself so I need to just suck it up and do my work. I hate winter. I'm glad it's starting to warm up, hopefully it actually keeps getting warmer instead of just dropping to -40 again :(
It's so hard to get out of bed and go to school when you have a cold and it's super cold out! ugh.. life.
I need to find a way to be more motivated to go to school and to actually try hard. What to do!!
I also want to try and work out more, I'm thinking once I live nice and close to school next month it'll be easier since I'll also be close to the gym!

I got an apartment downtown right by the university on young st. I'm going to be living in the ghetto! It's a 2 bedroom and it'll be just for me and the pets which is nice since the extra room will mainly be the pet room. I get my bengal in April. I went and picked him out on the weekend and put my deposit down on him. I can't wait till he's up and moving around so I&nbsp;can go play with him :)

"event","I broke up with Eddie last night. 
We've been fighting so much lately I&nbsp;just couldn't take it anymore. It's really hard because I'm so tempted to just stay with him because it'd be so much easier. He promises things will get better and things will change but I've heard those words way to many times to believe anything will change or get better. I've never experienced a relationship where there was so much fighting. Nothing good can come from constant arguing. 
I have to figure out what's going on with the apartment. Tiffany is supposed to be moving in with me next month but I don't know where Eddie is going to go. He is making it seem like he needs me to live but I can't baby him and keep helping him with everything. He's 22 he needs to learn to take care of himself. 
It sucks because I thought it'd be easier to do since I just felt so sure it was what I wanted and now I feel confused and hurt. I need to stick to my guns because there's no point in dragging on a failing relationship. Break ups are too hard."

"event","&nbsp;A couple shitty things today&nbsp;

1. The guy who I went to before for my geese tattoo has now moved to a different shop. When I inquired about my new tattoo I was told I'd have to put down a $150 deposit which is high, but whatever it goes towards the tattoo, and then a $75 art fee which was me pretty much to pay him to just draw my tattoo. I want to get a small about 6"" tattoo of my dog and cartoon style now portait. That's so ridiculous! So I'm refusing to go to him due to the $75 art fee and now I have to go cruise around browsing profiles to find a new tattoo artist.

2. If the bus actually has a strike I either am going to have a moderatly long bike ride, plus downtown I think you can't bike on the sidewalk which scares me downtown all the cars, what not or I'd have to drive and pay for parking like&nbsp;a sap. They better not strike, or be running again by the time I'm back in school or I'll be hella pissed."

I only had 2 classes scheduled for the winter term because the biology course I planned on taking the labs all clashed with my other course, so I'll have to take a freakin' first year course in my 3rd year of university but whatever.. the first one didn't really count considering I only got 12credit hours.. so I'll be all done first year courses this term.&nbsp;
I decided to get into an education course for the winter term since I plan on doing it anyways.&nbsp;
Everything is all figured out and now only a few more weeks till it starts. I'm excited to start this year compared to last year since I'm more prepared for this year. I know what to expect now that I've already been through it and fucked a few classes up.&nbsp;
The fail will always stare at me on my transcipt but I guess it's my motivation to do really good now since I have to get my GPA up even more so"

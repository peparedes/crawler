It's not like my life is boring. In fact, its been pretty eventful for the most part, but I just haven't been feeling the urge to write. 
And its not just livejournalling.&nbsp; We do freewriting in my English class, but I'm just not feeling it.
I don't even write in my own journals anymore, although I should because it helps me make sense of things.
Dunno. Is it just a weird phase?
Maybe I'm distracted by Facebook, which has sucked my soul, but I'm fighting back.
I get bored with those things after awhile.

School is fine. I made a big decision to drop education from my degree. This means I'll be done here in 2009 (assuming all goes well) and them I'm off into the world. Wow, that seems like a long way away. Who knows, maybe I'll apply for teacher's college after all, but for now it was just a pain in the butt to be taking all these lousy ed classes that were teaching me absolutely nothing. How many times do i have to hear about classroom management techniques for 7-year-olds? I wanted to punch myself in the face! I've worked with kids since I was 14, I think I know what to do by now thankyouverymuch. Oh well, its all over with now! Yipee. i'm hoping to take some cool art and philosophy courses to make up for the credits that didn't transfer from education. 

Its about 1am and I'm in the ATAC spaceship building on campus... I was hoping that I'd be able to connect my video camera up to these computers, since it wasn't working on mine, but I realized a few minutes ago that the cable I need to connect to the video to the computer didn't actually come with the camera. Which is kinda dumb. So I'm gonna have to buy it tomorrow. Oh well, it will be worth it because we made the most ridiculously awesome&nbsp; video about superheroes. I got to wear my cape!! Its really true that when you are in spandex and wearing a cape, you can say or do anything because people already think you are weird. I've missed that feeling!

Sooooo I think I might finish this and head back home. 
I have a ultra boring 8:30am stats class that I can't wait to get up for!! 
Heheh, peace out homies!"

&nbsp;It was a BLAST. 
AND it was freaking cold! 
Including windchill, it was -41! Yikes! 

Which is why we had to come home a day early. 
Our prof said it was because ""the margin of for safety just kept on slimming"" but really.... a couple people got really cold despite their really expensive and brand new equipment.  

This was actually something I thought about before heading out for the weekend. 
Comparitively speaking, I have very little rec gear, and I was worried that this might result in me being less prepared or something like that. For example, I have some classmates who went overboard and bought hundreds and hundreds of dollars on new down-filled jackets, snowpants, boots, over-booties, fancy mitts, pulks, flint and steel, designer label fleece clothing, etc... you name it, they bought it. 
Meanwhile, I'm wearing my thrifty Value Village ensmeble combined with homemade unitard long johns (complete with a butt flap! I'm so proud), XXXL splash pants, baseball socks, 3 year old toques, mittens stolen from the lost and found and a crapload of layers of fleece PJs I've collected over the years. My mukluks were the best thing I brought out there, they were so toasty, but they are still half the price of specialized boots.  

So all I'm saying here is that I'm glad that I resisted the consumerism of Outdoor Rec and that I don't have to be decked out in MEC, Pantagonia, Sierra or North Face clothing to survive. In fact, I survived maybe even a little better than those fashionistas.  

I'm still so proud of my home-sewn unitard long-johns. They are HOT. 
Especially the butt flap. 
Awwww yea.  

Picture post at a later date.... 
Peace."

"event","Its been a busy week here in Ali-land.

So I realized why i came into my program here at Lakehead. Wednesday in my Outdoor Skills and Theory (osat) class, my two profs were teaching us about winter camping gear. Not only did they act out the process of going to bed while winter camping in -40 degree weather, they physically got changed inside their sleeping bags into their night clothes and bickered back and forth like an old married couple. What other program or school would you find this at? No where. 

Darrelle was right when she told me I have too much fun at school.

I'm really liking this semester. OSAT looks amazing. I'm going winter camping, dogsledding, iceclimbing and I'm in the process of making myself a pair of mukluks for our sewing project. I'm in a class that is essentially planning for a wo-week voyageur canoe trip with other fantastic people. I'm taking a programming class where I get to work with more fantastic people to create a project based on Silken Lauman's organization for Active Kids. Its pretty amazing. I'm getting really involved with the Outdoor Rec Student Society and getting to know some really cool friends.&nbsp; We sure did Party Like Your Grandma. I'm taking English with the same hippie teacher from last year. Its a good time. We meditated in class on Wednesday. It was really cool. 

The only thing thats a little unfun this semester is that I've stopped seeing the point of taking concurrent education.&nbsp; The courses I'm taking for it seem fairly pointless and I'm not feeling particular encouraged by them. Every time I go to class, I feel like I learn a new reason why I don't want to be a teacher. Not that I really wanted to be one in the first place, but still. It just makes it worse. I feel like I could be using the 4 courses in ed I've taken could have been used elsewhere to work towards a minor. I have some choices to make, I suppose.

I'm pretty happy right now though. Which is super. I'm having a good time with my friends here at school, and trying to balance the introvert and extrovert in myself.&nbsp; And i'm just waiting for the universe to align the way I want it to...&nbsp; when its ready, of course. In the meantime, I'm just gonna keep on keeping on.

Peace out, friends."

Its the autobiography of David's childhood as he fights to survive one of the most severe cases of child abuse ever recorded.&nbsp; It was heartbreaking and devestating, but also incredible. There are really no words to desrcibe this. I just hope that this book has helped to prevent such horrible things from happening to any other child. <br /> <br /> 8) <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/My-Secret-Postsecret-Frank-Warren/dp/0061196681/sr=1-2/qid=1168837079/ref=sr_1_2/702-0753473-7788832?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"">My Secret: Post Secret Book by Frank Warren&nbsp;</a> (7/10)<a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/My-Secret-Postsecret-Frank-Warren/dp/0061196681/sr=1-2/qid=1168837079/ref=sr_1_2/702-0753473-7788832?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books""><br /> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wasn't as good as I was expecting and most of the secrets were more depressing than anything, but just like with Found, I love looking at other people's stuff.

The writing syle was much more informal than I'm used to and it was a bit bizarre in concept, but I really grew attached to the story and the characters as it went on. Its basically about 6 children all genectically altered to have wings. They were raised as experiments in a lab, but were freed by a man who once worked there. Its about their struggle to stay together as a ""flock"" as they are being hunted and followed by the people who made them.&nbsp; It was overall pretty interesting and turned out to be a page-turner. I was also a quick read, which I generally like.&nbsp; Its part of a series though, so I gotta get the next one now...<br /> &nbsp;  <br /> 6) <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Found-II-Tossed-Forgotten-Around/dp/0743273079/sr=8-1/qid=1168836884/ref=sr_1_1/702-0753473-7788832?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"">Found II: More of the Best Lost, Tossed, and Forgotton Items From Around the World by Davy Rothbart</a>&nbsp; (10/10)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just love these books.

Right now is kind of a neat time. I'm feeling anxious for a lot of things, none of which are directly school related. Which is unusual for me. I've been thinking about The Secret a lot, and looking at a lot of different articles on similar theories or ideas.&nbsp; It all makes sense to me, but the hard part is not the ""asking"" or the ""answering""... but the ""recieving"" of opportunities. 

I have two big goals that I've been asking the universe for. 
1) At least $10,000 unexpected income.
2) Go to Antarctica in December 2007.

Sounds silly to just ask for 10 grand... its not like it's just gonna happen over night (or maybe it will)... but if the universe gives me an opportunity to make extra money, then that could potentially generate that extra income. For example, I started asking before Christmas (pretty regularly I repeat these goals before I go to sleep, too) and I've already made $20... a scratch and win. And I'm looking for a job right now and maybe thats how I'll make the money. Or maybe I'll be inspired with a great new idea. Who knows.&nbsp; The hard part for me is hearing opportunity knocking.&nbsp; I'm try to be more open to it, but its hard!

The other hard thing is that there is so much I want to be doing right now.&nbsp; I have the bigges side-project to do list that I've ever had, but even though school has barely started, I'm already feeling behind. I just gotta keep at it, I guess. But it sucks when boring stuff comes up that is a priority over my exciting project. Its hard to find that balance!

Annnnnd its 3am because I've been thinking too much and my brain is too loud to let me sleep. 
Send me good vibes and wish me unexpected income! : )"

I even got a Harry Potter podcast that was all about the new book title (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, for those who don't know about it yet).

Yesterday's leadership exam went super well. I was studying with Kristina, which I'd never done before, and it was fantastic. We had several completely ridiculous conversations... Somehow we got talking about how our future children will get married to each other and we will share a grandchild... 

A: Can you imagine? We'd be complete opposites as grandmothers!
K: Yea, you wouldn't let the kid play with knives.
A: Whats bad about that? You would encourage it.
K: True... so I guess if I were babysitting, you'd ""stop by with cupcakes"" pretty often, eh?
A: Only to make sure you weren't letting my grandchild drown in the bathtub.
K: Let's be fair, I'd give the kid a hairdryer first!

And so began our conversation about how we'll have to tag team Grandma duty so that our mutual grandchilren will be the perfect in everyway. We also made up some prety rad dance moves that we are planning to bust out in the near future.

Anyway. I had my Parks exam today... kinda brutal. Meh. It wasn't awesome, but just alright. I'm so glad I only have one more exam to go. And it should be relatively easy.

&nbsp;The next few days are going to be pretty fun. Tomorrow is Kristina's birthday so while studying we came up with a mission list.

Random aside,
I've been feeling pretty anti-social. In the BLAH sense too... like the ""hang-out-by-myself-in-my-room"" kind of way. I don't know why. Well, partially because exams are coming up and I need to study, but that can't be all of it. I remind myself often that university is more than schoolwork and I need to get out and do stuff... but I never feel like doing stuff. Don't get me wrong, I do go out and do things, and I love being with my friends. But I guess I've just been feeling invisible and boring. I've also realized that despite my ability to act extroverted, I'm actually a bit of an introvert at heart. I don't see this as a bad thing, but I think that when I revert back to introverted tendencies, people assume something wrong... when really, I just need to wind down for bit.

I dunno. That got a bit heavy for an aside.

Its written in the first person from seven-year-old Jesus'&nbsp; point of view. He doesn't know yet that he is the Son of God, but he does strange things that he can't explain or understand.&nbsp; The story is about his return to Nazareth after the death of Kind Herod and his discovery of who he really is.&nbsp; I grew up in a Catholic school so I knew the story of Jesus' birth, his teachings as an adult and his death. It was neat to read more about the middle part that I hadn't really heard anything about, even if it was partly fictional. Like how Jesus had a brother. Who knew? It was a son from Joseph's previous marriage, but still. A brother! Anyway, this book probably isn't for just anyone, but I really enjoyed this book and it was an easy read ( which is always refreshing). <br /> <br /> <br /> 4)&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Girls-Lori-Lansens/dp/0676977952/sr=8-3/qid=1164984614/ref=sr_1_3/702-5431922-5691247?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"">The Girls</a> by Lori Lansens (8.5/10)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really liked this book even though it seemed to take a long time for me to get through it. Its about Rose and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruby Darlen, a set of cranial conjoined twins. The book is kind of an autobiography, but it turns into more than<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just that. My favourite part is how each of the girls are portrayed as distinctly different people (which clearly<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they are) but how they compliment eachother.&nbsp; There are a few surprises along the way which made for an <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting read. Its also set in SW Ontario, which is always fun. <br /> <br /> 3) <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Racists-Kunal-Basu/dp/029785139X/sr=8-1/qid=1161567164/ref=sr_1_1/702-9170249-9003213?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"">Racists </a>by Kunal Basu<br /> 2) <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Phantom-Tollbooth-Norton-Juster/dp/0394820371/sr=1-1/qid=1161569888/ref=sr_1_1/702-9170249-9003213?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"">The Phantom Tollbooth</a> by Norton Juster<br /> 1) <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Phantom-Terry-Goodkind/dp/0765305240/sr=1-1/qid=1161570700/ref=sr_1_1/702-9170249-9003213?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"">Phantom </a>by Terry Goodkind&nbsp;</div>"

This is weird for me.<br /><br />Brief recap: Finshed all but one of my final projects last Wednesday and so as a result, I got lazy and did nothing life altering since. I do have my final project, a group one, that will be GREAT presentation tomorrow campaigning that Missinaibi Provincial Park is the greatest park in Ontario. It should be fun, to say the least. We even made stickers, posters and buttons!<br /><br />I watched the documentary movie The Secret last week. Its about the law of attraction (like attracts like) and how it relates to the power of thought. They talk about how to get what you want by attracting positive things into your life via positive thoughts. You gotta ask the universe for what you desire (and you really do have to want it bad), wait for the universe to answer, and then align yourself to the universe by being ready for opportunity.  <br />This is only a small part of the film. It really is inspiring, even if you aren't the optimistic type. Anyone can take something from this movie. At the very least, a sense of hope.<br /><br />This movie meant a lot to be basically because it confirmed a lot of what I already believed in.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to talk about it, I'm ready and willing. In the meantime, check out the movie trailer at the website <a href=""http://whatisthesecret.tv/"">HERE</a>. I have the movie on my computer if you want me to send it to you.

"event","The chocolate-less allnighter was a success. I got my papers done on time without the extra sugar boost. 
But was it ever rough.

Lately people in my program are dropping out. Not just one or two people... but I've seen our numbers dwindle from 80 in first year to 50 this year.&nbsp; And over the last couple months (and especially th last week), 10 more have dropped leaving us at 40.
And recently its not just&nbsp; people who aren't suited for rec dopping out. Its people who ARE rec. The ones that you meet in first year and are 100% certain they are in for the long haul. The ones who own no dressy clothes and stict strictly to outdoor clothing brands? Gone. The ones who are attentive in class and have valuable contributions and experiences to share? Gone.&nbsp; The ones who eat, sleep and breathe outdoor rec? Gone.

Makes a lady think.
What is this program that I'm in? Ourdoor Recreation, Parks and Tourism.... hmmm. What will I do with this degree? I have no idea. One day own my own camp, maybe, but do I need ORPT to do it?&nbsp; I sure as heck don't want to be a trip guide for the rest of my life.&nbsp; In fact, I don't even know if I want to do that at all.&nbsp; Our classes are boring and dry, even in second year where we were told it would get better. It hasn't really.&nbsp; My marks are lower than ever, not because I don't try, but because my profs are unrealistic and wishy-washy. You know there is a problem with the course when the mid-term average is 49%.&nbsp; We are getting killed. We are worn out academically, socially and mentally. Ask any reccer and we will tell you how swamped we are, especially those in double degree programs. We will tell you about how this program is supposed to intrigue us, but its really discouraging.

We hear weekly about how jobs in tourism go just about no where.&nbsp; We hear parks offers a wide range of opportunities if you can get through the headaches of the government, but even if you can, efforts rarely pay off. Then we hear a lecture in our leadership class about how outdoor rec is worthless.

What are these profs teaching us? That we, the students of ORPT, are going nowhere.

Hence, everyone is dropping out to grasp some sort of future. 
But then I'm thinking.... a degree is a degree. Finish ORPT, get my teaching certification, figure life out from there. 
In the meantime, deal with the bullshit that makes ORPT what it is.&nbsp; 
Or figure something else out. 

Ah, but therein lays the rub... what else would I do?"

There was one RV that pulled in and we spoke to the guy who owned it.
He was cool until he started making racist comments. Boo. People are jerks.

The craziest thing we learned was that during the peak season (July/August), 20-25 RVs spend the night in the parking lot.
The KOA, just off the highway, costs 30 bucks a night. If they lose 25 customers to Walmart on one night, it means they are losing $750 dollars as well. In one week, thats a loss of $5250. WOW.
And that doesn't account for the extra things RVers may buy at the KOA (ie. wood, souveniers, food...etc).

She is to raise them without any influence so that in the end the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scientists can determine which is the superior race. Considering I had no expectations, this book ended up being alright. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was interesting, although it was slow reading at first.

Knowing the right time to lead and the right time to follow.
This is something I think about a lot and I've often struggled with, but I've really worked on it so that I can play both roles with relative ease.
I feel really comfortable when I am in control, so I usually prefer to take on leading roles over non-leading roles, but if the situation calls for me to follow, then I am usually more than willing.
What ticks me off is when people are totally unable or unwilling to take a backseat, ever. I don't mean more important things like values, ethics and beliefs. No, its when it is over things that are much much smaller.
This time, it was a simple presentation of a report. Commenced by other person. Other person lets me speak. I begin to speak. Other person FULLY INTERRUPTS ME to say exactly what I was already saying.&nbsp;

"event","I kinda wish I was going home this weekend for Thanksgiving.&nbsp; I would love to see my family and have some good eatin's.
Sven is already gone for the weekend, Kimmy leaves on Saturday, Jean is heading home too.
Simpson's brother is coming up for a visit and I don't want to intrude on their sibling bonding.

I bought this yummy looking turkey roast (because I'm not ready for real turkey yet!) and I was so excited to bring it home to show Simpson that I got us our own little feast. She totally snuffed it and wants nothing to do with it! How rude! It is a beautiful roast!&nbsp; Apparently all my other friends are also either too cool or too busy to come over to play Thanksgiving Dinner.&nbsp; I'll just have to play alone.
Booooo.
And if no one eats it with me on T-Giving, then they don't get any leftovers either! Sheesh!

At least I know I'm not all alone because I've been invited to a couple potlucks. One on Friday with Simpson and her camp frinds who are all up here for teacher's college. They are all really nice people, but I'm not sure if I'll be going. Call me anti-social, but I am the queen of awkward with strangers. And its not like I can rely on Simpson to be part of my buddy system because clearly she's gonna love being there with the people she's grown up with. Soooo I'm not sure about this one.
The other pot-luck will be fun, so I'll being attending for sure. THere will be a bunch of really fun people there that I already know and adore, so I'm looking forward to it. 

But I can't bring the turkey roast to either of these because the hosts already have it covered.... Pshh.

*sigh*

On the plus side, I'm doing a project on the Leadership of Albus Dumbledore.&nbsp; Who wants to fill out a really short survey??"

"event","It's funny when you realize something that should have been so obvious
. 
I realized today the pressure of having a roommate who spends money freely and guiltlessly. It makes me spend money too!
Last night there was a giant sale at ""The Trip Outdoors"", a local outdoor clothing/gear store.&nbsp; Everything was 30-70% off and there were some amazing deals. Originally, my plan was to leave with the same amount of money I arrived with, unless I saw something my heart truly desired.
Now, Simpson on the other hand was armed with her Visa card and ready to spend. 
I saw a sweater I really liked... and then I thought about the 50 dollar sweater I had just bought a week earlier. I moved on. I saw Simpson soon after carrying about 8 items. Holy. So then I start thinking: If SImpson can spend money, so can I! 
But, really, I don't have a whole lot to spend if I want to save up for the trip to Paris with my Mom in May. Or if I want to get on the Macchu Picchu trail before it closes down. Or if I want to go to Egypt with my brother at some point.
But I pick up the sweater anyway and carry it around as if holding it will make me decide faster. Simpson picks up a couple more things. I ask her how she affords it and she says its 'school related' so she's using her father's credit card. I don't think i could ever do that. Even if my mom gave me permission to use her credit card (i'm sure Simps had permission too), I would not be able to spend 200$ on it without feeling I've spent too much of her hard earned money.
I saw Simpson buy all this cool stuff and I got jealous, so in the end I bought the sweater.
Booo. 

So the moral of the story is :&nbsp; Shop alone and with purpose."

I thought it'd be fun to walk around on it like a complete goon.
No, my leg gave out, I ran into Simpson and rolled my ankle.
It's pretty painful.

<div text=""Lessons from Geese."" class=""ljcut""><strong>Lessons from Geese</strong><br /><br /><em>In the fall when you see geese heading South for the winter, flying along in the 'V' formation, you might be interested in knowing what science has discovered about why they fly that way. And what others believe to be a valuable application to groups of all kinds.<br /><br /></em>
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Fact:&nbsp; </span></strong>As each goose flaps its wings, it creates an uplift for the birds that follow. By flying in a ""V"" formation, the whole flock gains 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew alone.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Lesson: </span></strong>&nbsp;People who share a common direction and sense of community can get where they are going quicker and easier because they are traveling on the thrust of one another.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Fact: </span></strong>&nbsp;When a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of flying alone. It quickly moves back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird immediately in front of it.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Lesson:&nbsp; </span></strong>If we have as much sense as a goose we stay in formation with those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and give our help to others.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Fact:&nbsp; </span></strong>When the lead goose tires, it rotates back into the formation and another goose flies to the point position.&nbsp; </p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Lesson:</span></strong>&nbsp; It pays to take turns doing the hard tasks and sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent on each other's skill, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, and resources.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Fact:</span></strong>&nbsp; The geese flying in formation honk to encourage those up in front to keep up their speed.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Lesson:&nbsp; </span></strong>We need to make sure that our honking is encouraging. In groups where there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of encouragement (to stand by one's core values, and to encourage the core values of others) is the quality of honking we seek.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Fact: </span></strong>&nbsp;When a goose gets sick, wounded or shot, two geese drop out of formation and follow it down to help and protect it. They stay with it until it dies or is able to fly again. Then, they launch out with another formation or catch up with the flock.</p>
<br />
<p style="""" class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style="""">Lesson:</span></strong>&nbsp; If we have as much sense as geese, we will stand by each other in difficult times as well as when we are strong.</p>

"event","Today was fantastic.

I got up early for my 8:30am OSAT lecture only to find out it will be the last one for the semester. because the rest of the course is practical. I will be going on my first canoe trip EVER this weekend and I am SO pumped. I don't really know anyone in my tripping group, so it will be neat to expand my social horizons. The only thing I'm a little intimidated by is the lack of experience I have in comparison with everyone else. I'm sure it will be awesome though.

Anyway, my day continued by sending a couple items in the mail and then riding my bike around campus. I came home, sorted some of my email contacts. HOLY. Clearly I haven't done this in a bazillion years because I don't even know who some of the contacts are. One contact didn't even have an email. Only a phone number that I was able to trace to somewhere in Michigan. RANDOM.

Then I had my Parks class and we convinced my prof to cancel class on Wednesday so that we could help clean Lake Tamblyn (our mini-Lake-Ontario on campus. Its pretty gross...)! Rad!

After class I went on a solo expedition to the mall where I bought a new sweater for my trip. I browsed a whole lot and tried on some clothes for the heck of it. I never do this, but I suppose my brain was in the right place today. I also saw about 6 mullets today and that is always a beautiful thing.

I decided to walk a couple blocks to Walmart... But I got distracted by Value Village on the way. Oh man, I found some GOLDEN items.&nbsp; Like a sparkly spandex unitard with a collar and a gold belt. OH YES. There is so much potential! I also scored this sweet winter vest, a stylish rain jacket (if you can even imagine one exists), and a small bag. 

I then ventured next door to a spiffy new dollar-ish store. I was roaming nicely and I ran into a girl from my classes and she offered me a ride home!
Horray!

I was just enjoying some Tenacious D... Tribute is the best rock-out song ever.

I am going to make Perogies for dinner and then read my book, drink tea and just relax. 
Because that is the best thing way to finish off today."

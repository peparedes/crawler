"event","So here I sit as someone else does for Jason what I will never be able to. I wish to be free of this forever envy!!! I wish to be thankful that he is getting what he needs. As he says its ""SO EASY"" for him to do for me. That was two years ago. Why do I let it affect me so badly. If the relationship between Toby and I was actually a good one would I have squandored that to be with Jason? Since his mother passed he has not been mentally stable enough to play with me. His lack of true interest was boggling me for quite some time. Last night we had a discussion that consisted of him telling me that when in the heat of the bDsm moment he will fuck anything. And I know that is not a slight against me. My little candle continues to glow either way. I'm such a sad human being. In love with a gay man completely out of my reach. Why do I bother you ask? I love him. Unconditionally. At all costs to me."

"event","I cannot speak of such things on my facebook as I don't want everyone freaking out on me. Jason told me today that his mood swing was so severe that he felt like he didn't want to be alive anymore. This shocked me I suppose.. but I understand how he feels to a certain extent. If this is indeed ""male menopause"" it may be likened to pms. And that feeling I know all too well. Here I am just finished reading a page about suicide that spoke to me deeply. ""Suicide is not chosen; it happens
when pain exceeds 
resources for coping with pain.""

Unfortunately his life is stocked with pain. His body crumbles around him and there is nothing I can do to stop it. I want so badly to take away his pain.. but I am once again completely powerless. God what a life. Such joy and such pain. Is the ultimate joy worth the agony of all this? That is the question. The man I'm going to marry. The man i'm going to divorce as soon as he finds a suitable husband. Who knew I would get myself into this type of mess. I love you so much. I don't know how else to say it. My heart is breaking at the thought of losing you even for an instant. I will not accept you dying or any variation thereof."

Had to realize that I am myself worthy and working towards him everyday. I need everything he can offer me. His life has been overcomplicated of late also.

Whatever you do 
I will be right here waiting for you 
Whatever it takes

Make of our hands one hand, 
Make of our hearts one heart, 
Make of our vows one last vow: 
Only death will part us now. 
Make of our lives one life, 
Day after day, one life. 
Now it begins, now we start 
One hand, one heart, 
Even death won't part us now.

yeah another song to fill the world with. But if you don't know where it comes from.. or it's melody then you'll never understand fully the power.. and you won't fully realize why the end of the story sucks so much. 

I in turn have faced my time... the endless toil of the day to day... the first. the last. the only. why have you come and made me wait? How long will this endless delay.... lasting longer than anything

Soon our time will come flying over the hills.. til we meet again my friend

May the road rise to meet you,
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face,
The rains fall soft upon your fields.
And until we meet again,
May God hold you in the palm of his hand.

Don't get the idea that I believe in God... it's part of the blessing... TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT!"

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I --
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

Hey I'm not generally a poetry person.. but this is probably the best description of my life. Perhaps everyone has come to a crossroad in their own life. Looking down the easy path and then the hard one. Perhaps the easy one looks more inviting.. but in it's easiness lies deception and failure.

Or does it hold the easy answer? Did you cheat in school? I know I did. Fuck the world!

But I was instilled with certain things from my parents... DAMN THEM!
Work hard... take the high road... don't cheat... do it all yourself... WELL I AM FUCKERS! No help from the parents... 

But I have taken the hard way. The road less traveled. When I am needed I am always there no matter what. I will lay down my life for the right person. 

I only recently realized that a lot of people aren't like that. They don't want to sacrifice for someone they love. Are they selfish or smart? You decide. Sleep well."

ROT IN A PATHETIC MESS THAT'S WHAT! 

We aren't designed to exist without the help of others. Why do you think we crave human contact anyway? 

Hermits are those who wish to cut off all human contact and die softly alone. What kind of a life is that? Not a good one I can tell you that.... 

And family.. let us not forget them. Pushing us for excellence when it really seems as if they're trying to kick us in the ass... oh wait.... 

THAT'S WHY THERE'S A GIGANTIC PROVERBIAL BRUISE.. ON MY ASS.... FROM MY PARENTS!!!  Thanks so much mom and dad... the ass kicking really worked. I'm still living the way I want.. how I want.. where I want...(well kinda)

and you thought I wasn't going to add a song on this one!! HA HA HA!!! YOU WERE WRONG...

Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of ?9...Wear sunscreen


If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years youll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you cant grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked...Youre not as fat as you imagine.

Dont worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.

Do one thing everyday that scares you

Sing

Dont be reckless with other peoples hearts, dont put up with people who are reckless with yours.

Floss

Dont waste your time on jealousy; sometimes youre ahead, sometimes youre behind...the race is long, and in the end its only with yourself.

Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.

Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.

Stretch

Dont feel guilty if you dont know what to do with your life...the most interesting people I know didnt know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still dont.

Get plenty of calcium

Be kind to your knees, youll miss them when theyre gone.

Maybe youll marry, maybe you wont, maybe youll have children, maybe you wont, maybe youll divorce at 40, maybe youll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary...what ever you do, dont congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either - your choices are half chance, so are everybody elses.

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can...dont be afraid of it, or what other people think of it, its the greatest instrument youll ever own.

Dance...even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.

Read the directions, even if you dont follow them.

Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.

49 second break in speech -- Quindon singing

Get to know your parents, youll never know when theyll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.

Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography in lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.

Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.

Travel.

Accept certain inalienable truths, price will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do youll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

Respect your elders.

Dont expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.

Dont mess too much with your hair, or by the time its 40, it will look 85.

Be careful who advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than its worth.

But trust me on the sunscreen...

Like many I live and breath my life through music and its essence... that which is transferred to you in lyric, in phrase. Soul shattering song that can for one instant bring you back to the brink of the black abyss (where you doubt your very soul.. praying for death).. and in the other bring you back to a moment that heightens your soul back to a happiness you knew once, long ago. 

When do you feel the most? What makes your body evoke pain or sorrow... and such sweet joy? In one simple line of a piece of music... 

""I dreamed a dream, a silent dream of a land not far away where no bird sang, no steeples rang, and teardrops fell like rain. I dreamed a dream; a silent dream. I dreamed a dream of a land so filled with pride that every song, both weak and strong, withered and died. I dreamed a dream No hallelujah; not one hosanna! No song of love, no lullaby. And no choir sang to change the world. No pipers played, no dancers twirled. I dreamed a dream; a silent dream. Awake, awake! Soli deo gloria! Awake, Awake! Awake my soul and sing, the time for praise has come. The silence of the night has passed, a new day has begun! Let music never die in me; forever let my spirit sing! Wherever emptiness is found let there be joy and glorious sound. Let music never die in me; forever let my spirit sing! Let all our voices join as one to praise the giver of the sun! Awake, awake! Let music live!""

Forever let your spirit sing.. Let your life be filled with glorious sound."

I never knew that my skin was too black.
I never knew that my nose was too flat.

I never knew there were things that I'd missed,

I was intrigued by the cracks in the walls.
I tasted, with joy, the dust that would fall.
The noise in the hallway was music to me.
The trash and the rubbish just cushioned my feet.

""Chil', look deep into my eyes.""
""Chil', look deep into my eyes.""
""Chil'...""

Deep in my eyes the sadness waits... to be born forth into a world in which it will sink to the cold ground and be washed down into the stinking sewer of the world. Lost forever in a great medley of pain. Sweet thoughts... comforting... soothing... sleep well my handsome prince."

"event","In which the days seem to endlessly drag on in my heavy life. I wish to have the hope I had in former lives. Waiting diligently for the end to near so my next happiness can begin. I search for the one whom I've known forever. So long that my soul has not been allowed to remember everything I've seen. The memories blocked from me for reasons higher than I'll ever understand. I want so much to be freed from these bonds that hold me to this decaying Earth. But I must delay my inevitable crisis... inevitable painful end that will come when my goals have been met on this miserable planet. I search for the one who understands me... more than I ever could understand on my own with the knowledge I've been given. 

For the one... your darkness shall envelope me... for darkness is your curse... you hunger to taste me on your lips... but dare not obey your ghastly thirst. I wait in the awesome empty void for one more fleeting kiss. The maleficent guardian awaits. 

I feel a hidden pain in you that you don't understand. It seeths within your body waiting to tear free and rend your flesh. I know what you are feeling because we two are kindred. You don't know me as I know you and that is what frightens you. To be known. To be human. To be in pain. Love, desire, pain, torture, knowing, wanting, hating, peace, prosperity, loss, faith.

To all who know. To all who don't. Give whatever you can to the ones you hold dear. Be passionate with whomever will share with you their gravest secrets and dark shadows of their being. Be kind. Be thankful. Be what you wish and not what they want you to be. Be at peace."

"event","You got to leave me now, you got to go alone 
You got to chase a dream, one that's all your own 
Before it slips away 
When you're flyin' high, take my heart along 
I'll be the harmony to every lonely song 
That you learn to play 

When you're soarin' through the air 
I'll be your solid ground 
Take every chance you dare 
I'll still be there 
When you come back down 
When you come back down 

I'll keep lookin' up, awaitin' your return 
My greatest fear will be that you will crash and burn 
And I won't feel your fire 
I'll be the other hand that always holds the line 
Connectin' in between your sweet heart and mine 
I'm strung out on that wire 

And I'll be on the other end, To hear you when you call 
Angel, you were born to fly, If you get too high 
I'll catch you when you fall 
I'll catch you when you fall 


Your memory's the sunshine every new day brings 
I know the sky is calling 
Angel, let me help you with your wings 

When you're soarin' through the air 
I'll be your solid ground 
Take every chance you dare 

I'll still be there 
When you come back down 
Take every chance you dare, 
I'll still be there 
When you come back down 
When you come back down"

Won't anyone see... see my tortured soul... hear my whispers,no... whimpers in the night...the dark which consumes me... owns me... takes the very breath from my lips as if it were cheap bubblegum in some underrun convenience store. Quiet screaming as my body aches for someone to just know me."

"event","Do you ever feel as if you're completely alone in the world and yet you have someone speaking through your mind to your soul? Does your body cry out for a moment of peace? Do you want more? So much more that anything short of perfection will plunge you into the perilous wastelands of death? Is every waking moment of your life dedicated to making sure you aren't the only one? The only one who sees. The only one who hears. The only one who knows. Why aren't you on your way to greatness right at this very instant? 

Oh yeah.. the world makes you plain. You're just like everyone else.. a cookie cut from the same cutter as the rest of the human race. Why strive to be someone when we can't get beyond the tethers we were born with?

Find peace if you can. Find someone to hold. Make life your everlasting task. 

I've been searching for you. And I have searched many years. I will never abandon you. I am not like ""them"". By your side in spirit. In your mind. In your soul. Be at peace.

Whoever you are."

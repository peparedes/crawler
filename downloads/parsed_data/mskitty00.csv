Candlelight on porcelain set tables
and that's fine, I'll go out of my way
for you anytime
that's right baby

the fire's warm
so you take off your sweater
now it's my turn and I'll do you one better
that's the game we both like to play

You wink
I laugh
we know a little hug leads to a foot rub
then a hot tub
then a french kiss on a bear rug
do you like it, do you like it
how about this wanna try it 
oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll Take That As a Yes

You like snuggling with your pillow
with my arms tight holding us together
breathing deep and drifting like a feather in a stream
then I touch you on the shoulder
feel your skin soft underneath my fingers
and I know we'll never get to sleep...

I'll take that as a yes!"

"event","So its been a while since I last wrote anything in here...and why is that you ask?  Well, could it be that I finally have a distraction strong enough to keep me from writing sappy messages at 2:00 in the morning.  That it is.  So I know you all probably are wanting details which I will be glad to talk about how awesome he is whenever ur interested, though I'm not gonna dish too much online cause I wouldn't want him getting too big an ego, now would I?  But yeah, I have pretty much been spending the majority of my time hanging out and getting to know him.  Which has been so much fun.  Its nice to have finally found a guy worth getting to know.  And its weird cause I never would have thought of myself as someone to actually get ""picked up"" in a random place...but we met in an elevator.  And me being my usual self was totally oblivious to the fact that I was getting hit on until about our 3rd date.  Go me for being the perceptive sales person.  lol  Anyways, he's incredibly funny, very sweet, very generous..if ya know what i mean? ;), i feel 100% comfortable around him...and he is about by far the most stable person I have ever been interested in.  Which for those of you who know my dating history...I could make fund a psychiatric practice off the issues of those other guys.  So yeah.  I can say for the first time in a looooooong while that I am genuinely happy and I dunno whether that is because of him, or because something about me has changed in meeting him, but I have absolutely no complaints.  Well, gotta get back to work so I can leave here at a decent time.  So catch you all later."

"event","Oh, and I feel as if I should clarify what exactly ""Anti-Valentines' Day"" entails for those of you who would like to join in the festivities worldwide:

1 - you must go to the grocery store and specifically buy yourself some little delicacy you wouldn't otherwise make for yourself.

2 - wear your most comfortable pair of clothes...after all...today is all about you.

3 - watch that movie that always makes you feel better whether it be Bridget Jones or Rambo.  

4 - Pamper yourself...I prefer a pedicure or a seaweed mask.  Guys - don't be ashamed to go super metro today.  

and FINALLY!

5 - Sit happy...knowing that if you want to express your feelings to someone, you don't need to wait til a random day in February to do it.  Honestly. I'd rather get a daisy you picked on the side of the road that you gave me just for the heck of it than an overpriced bouquet of flowers that you felt obligated to give me because of all of the 1-800-flowers and hallmark commercials that have been on tv all day.  

So, i'm sure you're thinking...oh, she's just the bitter jilted lover.  Well, yes, i've been dumped twice on Valentine's Day...but anyone who knows me will say once a hopeless romantic, always a hopeless romantic.  I'm still waiting for that white horse to come breaking through the woods....:-D"

I don't think my passion for paleontology/archaeology will ever die.  There's something about the past that's so hypnotizing.  Learning about it somehow makes everything make sense.

We had such an awesome time and I must say its nice having a friend studying massage therapy that needs a ""dummy"" to practice on.  Man...i'll volunteer for that anytime.  So yeah, all in all it was a great weekend.  Had a lot of fun friday just hangin out, watching movies with my fellow scene it lover.  So I guess its back to the grind again.  I always dread sundays...you can see all the work you have for the week and that just sort of ruins the whole experience.  Eh, what can ya do?  Well, i think i am going to read some more of my crichton book and maybe get to bed early.  I didn't get to sleep in like I usually do on the weekends so I could use the rest.

"event","Somewhere there's a stolen halo
I use to watch her wear it well
Everything would shine wherever she would go
But looking at her now you'd never tell

Someone ran away with her innocence
A memory she can't get out of her head
I can only imagine what she's feeling
When she's praying
Kneeling at the edge of her bed

She wants someone to call her angel
Someone to put the light back in her eyes
She's looking through the faces
The unfamiliar places
She needs someone to hear her when she cries

She just needs a little help
To wash away the pain she's felt
She wants to feel the healing hands
Of someone who understands

And she says take me away
And take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me like holy water...
--Big and Rich ""Holy Water""




So I was driving home last night in the car and heard this song again which got me thinking about things.  For some reason this has become a topic that keeps coming up lately so I think that's why its been on my mind so much when it normally isn't.  I can't help but wonder how things would have turned out and what my life and even myself would be like if things had gone differently that day.  If i'd just decided to stay home or go to bed early.  I have never had any regrets about anything I've done before and since, but I can't help but wonder what it would be like...to not have ever felt so much hurt...to not feel like I always have to take charge of my life.  It was nice just letting things ride...living on this idealized dream that I never had any doubts that would happen and that I knew was the one thing I wanted out of life.  So now here I am.  Somehow I managed to eek out and get that dream, but it doesn't really mean the same thing anymore that it did before.  I am here, but I don't really feel a sense of accomplishment.  I dunno if that makes any sense.  But I still feel like i'm missing something.  I just don't know what it is..."

After spending 3 hrs playing scene it in my apartment getting liquored up...he has shown his true nature as the obscure movie king.  I swear, if they made some B horror flick in the 1960s this guy's seen it.  Of course I got all the 80s stoner movies right and most of the chick flicks, but hey...that about sums up my lifetime...lol.  In the end, I won by 1 question.  We were neck in neck the whole time.  I know you guys are prolly thinking i am the biggest dork in the world, but that was by far the funnest internet meeting i've ever had.  Most of them end up being either stalkers or losers.  I must say it was quite refreshing.  Anyways, things are looking up at work.  I hit 110% of my sales goal with 4 more days in the sales month to go.  WOOHOO.  I think i might finally be getting the hang of this shit.  Plus, now my boss won't be riding my ass til friday.  Which is always a good thing.  That man could give the pope a heart attack.  Anyways, i think its time for me to go to bed.  I am exhausted..thanks to a ""distraction"" that kept me up last night...but hey...who's complaining?  I'm certainly not.  ;)  Laters."

Which considering my current boredom, might be a welcomed diversion.  I think he is going to come on vacation with me and the girls this spring which means I have to get my ass back into shape again.  At least back to where I was when we were dating.

A blank canvas, you're willing to be painted with any kink.
As long as it's washed down with some sweet whipped cream.

"event","Well, what can I say from my last entry but that I am a total sucker and allowed myself to get hurt yet again.  I think its time I tried a hiatus from the lesser gender.  They really aren't building a good impression of themselves as a whole.  This song says it all:

He was a bad boy and I was a good girl
He needed me to smooth out the edges
He'd get his drink on and flirt with the ladies
After six months of his crap I quit begging 
I'm a magnet for the fixer upper man
If I know it's fire, why do I let it burn my hand

Cupid works for the devil
Be suspicious if he cries
You know sex is usually good
Yeah, but it ain't always right
Chocolate is a band-aid and no matter what they say
Shoes don't stretch and men don't change

I took a chance last week and put my heart on the line and I got more than I could have hoped for in return.  I am just scared i'll wake up one day and this whole fairytale (more like soap opera) i'm living will have vanished.  Guess that's the risk of true love."

"event","OK, so today was blowout and I must say it was all in all a great day.  I talked to someone I haven't in a long while today and i left feeling very satisfied at closing the book for good on a dark chapter in my life.  I'm leaving here in a week and will not look back, but I'll be leaving with some happy memories at least.  I have so much to look forward to ahead of me and I can't wait to start living life the way it should be.  I'm in love for the first time and its a wonderful feeling...scary...but i think that's part of it.  I don't know what the future holds, but I know that I will make the best of it and be satisfied with the experiences I have had.  I love all of you and this is not blowout talking.  I have to work tomorrow so that stopped a while ago.  

Things to focus on the next few weeks:
Not missing clint too much.
working out more
eating less and better
tanning at the beach
working to pay off some of my bills....


Wish me luck!"

I can balance the checkbook, 
I can pump my own gas. 
Can talk to my friends, 
about the size of my ass. 
My beauty's a masterpiece, 
and yes, it takes long. 
At least I can admit,

I don't drive in circles, 
at any cost. 
And I don't have a problem, 
admitting I'm lost. 
I never forget, 
an important date. 
You just gotta deal with it, 
I'm usually late. 
I don't watch movies, 
with lots of gore. Oh yeah, I can get her. 
In your dreams, my dear, 
I can do better! 
Flowers are okay, 
But jewelry's best. 
Look at me you idiot... 
Not at my chest???? 
I don't have a problem,

Let me start off by saying...thank you Paull's Deli and Jagermeister for bringing me together with 2 of the coolest guys I have ever met.  Its been a great few weeks and many more to come hopefully.  Spring break rocked...the cruise was such a relazxing thing to do and now I have another vacation to look forward to.  A certain someone is putting me up, thanks to the Navy, in New Orleans in April.  I am so excited.  Never been there, but I hear it is gorgeous and any place would be fun as long as he was there.  So....life is amazing.  I got my job too btw....going in tomorrow to firm things up.  But all in all, I am perfectly happy for the first time in a long while."

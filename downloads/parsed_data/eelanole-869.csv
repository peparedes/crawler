"event","You know, it's a rare occasion when i find a drunk person i don't like. Of course that's not including when my roommate turns his liver into swiss cheese. I feel like i'm babysitting. Between the informative vomit bulletins and the cries of desperation for another bowl of Ramen, the humor seems to have left.

It makes me hope i'm not that bad when i'm under the influence.

For anybody out there wondering, GTA: San Andreas fucking rocks. Any game where you can beat people with a big purple dildo can't be all bad. I've been playing with my neighbor for about 4 days straight now.

You know, it's pretty funny that more people in my dorm tonight were drunk than were sober. Except for me. Doesn't that sound fun..."

"event","OK, tell me if this makes sense to anybody. I've now been awake about 22 hours straight. That's because tuesdays and thursdays i have stupid ass fucking geology at 9 am. 9AM!!! Ok, now right now all of u saying nine in the morning isn't that bad, go fuck yourselves, it is for me.
back to the i'm stupid part. now for a few weeks i have not been able to wake up for this ungodly hour. So last night i get the bright idea, ""hey why don't i just stay up all night and then go to sleep after class?""
Sounds ok so far, u know people do dumb stuff. but i hadn't really taken into account the engineering midterm i have in about an hour. so, yeah, that is going to really suck.
Plannin on hittin up that OC this weekend, should be awesome. I havn't told my parents i'm going, and i probably won't, just for the fun of it."

"event","I think I've gotten to a point now where I recognize something about myself. I have a problem. Right now, I'm in Tallahassee having the time of my life. And yet, this is high school all over again. The same angst and agony every time I have to bring myself to write a measley page or two. The same skewing of priorities. Right now, I'm having the time of my life, knowing full well that the path I'm headed down right now leads nowhere. No more financial aid. No more College of Engineering. No more FSU. But even knowing this and putting it down here will hardly change it. The best I can do is pull up on the controls and hope i don't crash. That isn't me though. I'm not the hero that lands the plane after the disaster. I'm the guy back in coach wondering why they wouldn't give him any more peanuts.

Now that my psycho-babble is out of the way, i guess i can put down what's been happening to me. Since I got here to Tally, i have not been home even once. I havn't even thought about it. This weekend I'm going on a trip not home, but to ucf to see my friends. That could  say something about why I came here in the first place, but i'm already past the psycho-babble.
For anybody that knew me back at home, and how  rediculously easy my last job was, I have now topped it. I am a tutor for the Florida State University Athletic Academic Support Department. a.k.a., i keep jocks from failing college algebra. 7 bucks an hour to simplify polynomial fractions sounds pretty damn good to me.

Classes are what's killing me right now. I actually have a class that i have only attended once since the semester began. Aside from that one day, i know nothing about the class, test schedules, assignments, etc. NOTHING. A 'd' would be a miracle that i would gladly accept as of now.

I thought putting all of this down might help me sort through some of it a little bit, but it's 5:15 am, so there's not much sortin goin on right now."

"event","Hey everyone out there. uh...this is my first time keeping any kind of journal, much less an online one. i guess i might as well start with some good news. (drum roll please) i was just accepted to the wonderful Florida State University!! i'll give it a couple entries before i start boring you with all the emotional/mental issues that a good thing like getting into college entails.
Wow, i kinda don't know what to talk about...i don't want to be to cliche on my first entry.
How many of you out there think this years presidential race should be decided by a no holds barred hardcore cage match between dubya and kerry. anyway, i'll probably be back tonight to post again."

"event","spent too long waiting for a friend to show up to meet for coffee (she didn't) and then all day driving in the rain. (not a problem cause i was able to help my sister buy a car - yay but not the most exciting day either) 
hoping tomorrow will be better - i have plans to go meet this other mom who sounds like good friend material, but after brandon spent all day with sick kids, i doubt i'll get much time out tomorrow. 

oh well. here's hoping tonight doesn't disinigrate into another fight."

"event","all my concern about fitting raven's schooling and morning gym time into the same day was for naught... raven finished a full days worth of schoolwork in about an hour. hmm. maybe she should have started second grade after all. i'll have to see how it goes over the next couple of weeks, but it seems likely to me that she could be completely done with the first grade stuff before christmas, and maybe move on to second grade after the holidays. i don't want to push her too hard, but  i also don't want to be completely holding her back either, just because she's young. 
my fears about the gym were unfounded too. i only put 15 min of cardio since we got there late (no real excuse, it's just hard for me to get off the phone sometimes) and i wanted to be sure to get all the upper body stuff done that i wanted. doing reverse pyramid training this time, but i found i didn't lose quite as much as i thought i did. maybe i can't quite handle the same workout i was doing in july, but it's not too far away, as long as i keep at it. this si such a vital time of year to keep up with this stuff, too. holidays are so stressful anyway (especially with all this marraige drama) - i am determined not to add losing stamina/strength and gaining weight to the mix. i need all the energy i can get today.

so, now all i need to do today is russian and menu planning. and laundrey. and clean up the living room. and empty the litter box. and make dinner. 

oh boy.

time for some espresso."

"event","another long unproductive emotionally draining fight last night after what was up until that point a really great evening. wondering how long we can go without this happening again. i guess it's kind of soon for me to expect the fighting to dwindle, but it's just so exhausting. i'm trying to contemplate what it's going to take for me to feel respected. i certainly don't right now. 
it's so tricky. how do you maintain a humble/repentant attitude at the same time as some level of self-respect? how much respect should i require from him, in light of the current situation? this reminds me of the idea of hard boundries and soft boundries. i can't clearly discern what catagory a lot of the issues we are dealing with go into.

after staying up till about 5 (5:30?) arguing, i got up with zara at 6:30. raven was up by 7, and i broke my own no movies before lunch rule. the girls watched a movie while i napped on the couch. not enough napping though. i felt ready to go to bed at 8, but years of experience with insomnia has taught me not to make that mistake, no matter how tired. my goal is to be in bed by 9:30 though (an accomplishment for me) and up by 5:30 or 6. raven's first grade curriculum arrived today, and i need to get everything ready for her first official day of school tomorrow. 

i'm desperate to get back to the gym too. i only went twice last week. damnit. i've lost so much stamina it's not even funny. i don't even want to know how much muscle mass i've lost. tomorrow i get to find out how much weaker i am, when i do my upper body routine. damn, damn damn. it's gonna suck. i need to have some kind of critical limit, because i feel SO much better when i am going to the gym regularly. gaining more overall strength has definately become a real goal for me. it would certainly be helpful the next time someone tries to push me in front of a car. 

sooo...

tomorrow.
raven school, russian, gym, and menu for the rest of the week."

"event","so i think i'm going to try to start livejournaling again. i've been writing a lot at home lately, but i have this tendency to kind of spiral into melodrama with my own writing. it MAY be a release to some extent, but then there is also the fact that when i am writing something that someone else might possibly be reading, i tend to try and be a little more reasonable/objective. i like livejournal because i'm never quite sure if anyone else is reading my rantings, so i can find the happy (?) medium between reckless and reasonable. 

so... my life right now...

brandon just got back from pennsylvania with the kids today. we've had a very rough week and i wasn't quite sure what to expect when he got back, but we wound up having a fairly productive evening, conversation wise. he basically said that we should try to spend the next couple of weeks behaving as the people we think we can be, and then take a break for a few days to possibly a month or more, and examine ourselves and determine if we each think that we are right for each other, and if this is really what we both really want. we had a really fucking horrible couple of days before he went to pick up the kids (marriage on the rocks drama) and he made the very reasonable point that we need to figure out if our marraige is what we both really want so that we don't end up wasting our lives commiting to something that is going to crash once our kids are grown and gone. he also stated that it was really important to him that i examine myself and determine not just what i ""want"" but also what i am willing to commit to and what i am willing to put up with. suprisingly (to me), he didn't ask for an answer right now, but that i spend some time really figuring this out, because he doesn't want to invest himself in something that is going to blow up in his face. i have agreed to do my best to honor his request, and really examine myself and my marraige before i answer all of those questions. he has agreed to do the same, so it looks like in a couple of weeks we will be taking some sort of break from the situation and trying to both determine what we really want, and what we are willing to do. i guess you could call it a trial separation..? but it wasn't really expressed in those terms. i certainly think he's right about the fact that we could both use a little perspective in the situation. and i definately respect his desire to have a more solid answer instead of just diving into trying to fix things when we are both in such an unsure place. 

we both certainly have a lot of hard things to face right now, in our marraige and in ourselves.  i *am* grateful for the fact that the homefront itself is a lot more peaceful and rational than it was thursday/friday. things certainly got a little crazy for both of us, though i think we both went a little mad. definately madder than we would have done if the kids were home to bring us back to our responsibilities and other priorities.

on a lighter note, raven kept telling me how much she missed me, which was really nice to hear. but it came out in such strange ways...

  me: do you want some cheese?
  raven: yes, because i missed you SO MUCH mommy.

  me: time to go to bed.
  raven: i missed you SO MUCH mommy, i think i need to stay up late tonight.

as always, zara was really shy when she got home for a few minutes, but she was really goofy and laughing a lot all night, and i got more than a few ""i luzz you too, mommy"" out of her. for some reason it always comes out as a response from her, even if she says it first. she was also doing this thing where she goes all floppy, starts whining and saying ""mama""... her version of pretending to be a baby. i'm not sure if it has something to do with spending too much time away from home lately. she certainly never has to do that to get attention/affection from me. my children are way too kissable. i'm sure it's probably a little annoying to have such an affectionate mom. poor zara. raven has gotten to the point where she is starting to refuse a lot of it, so zara gets much of the affection that raven inspires in me too. i guess it isn't always helpful to be that cute. 

*sigh*

my kids are growing up too fast. what a typical mom thing to think. i can't believe i'm about to have a six year old. too damn weird. especially when i go to these moms groups and i have been a mom longer than many of the other mothers who are 5-15 years older than me. 

my life is so strange. 

or something.

i have so many different things to figure out, on so many fronts of my life. its weird to try and write about where i am without writing a whole fucking book. ok, i guess that would be a little easier since i don't think anyone on here has the patience to read that far. i suppose it would be a little more considerate of me to think about what would be worthwhile for me to write on here rather than just typing my thoughts as i think them. i guess that's the trouble with mavis beacon. i don't have enough interesting (for the reader, i suppose) to keep up with typing quickly so i just lay out a puzzle and i'm sure it doesn't make any sense to the hypothetical readers. maybe i should save all the really interesting stuff for the end of each entry. hmm.

anyway."

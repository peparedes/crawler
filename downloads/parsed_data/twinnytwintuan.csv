"event","wow. so much shit has been happening to me lately i just really needed somewhere to vent. my dad has always told me ever since we moved out here that id go through some tough times. i always thought that i would not let them get to me but its so hard to just shit like this slide. if someone doesnt like me just because im black,  think they should just die and get the hell away from me because they are all ignorant. for someone to make such a wrong judgement without even knowing me is insane. i am so sick of racist motherfuckers i swear to god next time im just going to snap and go crazy. theres no telling what could happen. heres the latest entry. today, me and my boy knuckles just chillin at the light after the softball game. this motherfucker comes up and starts staring us down so knuckles turns down his music. then as he takes off, he yells out that knuckles shouldnt hang out with NIGGERS. what the fuck i just wanted to kill that son of a bitch. i wanted to cry too but i was just so angry i didnt know what to do. sometimes it sucks so bad being who i am i wish i could just change ad be someone else. why cant people just accept me for who i am, a person, and look past the outside. it just makes me so upset to think that some people look down on me just because im different. what the hell i cant take this shit anymore. i hate it...i cant type anymore...."

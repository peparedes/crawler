Crazy. Check this out i'm running on about 4 hours of sleep the past few nights. I had a econ test today and all my labs were due. I didn't study for the lab quiz so thats a zero, but the lowest grade is dropped so not so bad. I have to work on my biology project today and tomorrow and then study for calc cause I got a test thursday. My mom wants me to come home on sunday for some blessing thing (I'm buddhist) so that takes the road trip plan off. hmm I gotta get some signatures tomorrow before Chapter for my frat. 

Money is a huge problem for me...I can't seem to regulate my spending...Bad

For good news I went to the Death Cab For Cutie concert today! I would have to say Travis Morrison and Rilo Kiley were better than Death Cab this time. They basically played the song as is on the cd rather than adding on to it. They did add more later on, but overall it felt nice to just get away from work...sucks to walk back into it.

Gotta BS some discussion stuff for Lit...it's about the cell. I'm a bio major...I've got it covered.

Burn some trees. cept they aren't.

So...the origin of life and if humans are aquatic mammals...these are the questions of life, man!...LIFE!

ok...seriously. entry. 

Yesterday = hazy. Spent all day at the house, and finished econ homework 10mins before it was due. Spent some time with andy at a bar and heard a good bit of stories over grouper...the fish. 

So about the theory on humans being aquatic mammals. We're the only creature that origniated from Africa that need so much water. We have a layer of fat over our muscles...blubber. We lack hair.

Next week DCFC! 

Man I need to go to class!

Got back to my room at around 3:00am. I guess i'll be doing a temp job at Chapter 11 till the end of this week. aiming for $200. Packaging materials like a pro.

"event","I decided to come home yesterday and found out that my mom got into an accident with my car and that my dad is using our swimming pool as a pond, so there's Koi swimming in there now. I drove my mom to work and then got into a car accident (not my fault)...wasn't the greatest visit home. 

I got tickets to the Death Cab For Cutie show. 10/12. I'm probably going to buy the tickets for The Blood Brothers show and The Dillinger Escape Plan. I also want to buy tickets for TV on the Radio w/ The Faint....I think they're playing together.

Last weekend was such a haze. I left to go to Athens on friday and then came back on saturday morning, then headed over to my fraternity to go to the game...left early and then headed back to my dorm to get some sleep...forgot everything else. err...most weekends are kinda hazy...most days actually.

No tests this week!

"event","Use your tounge...and it's a twist of everything i've said, which wasn't much. I've tried, I've thought, that maybe you could hear everything that I've mumbled. I love you and you looked up and asked if I was okay, because it sounded like a cough, and I replied fine. It left as fast as I took it in, which was the morning when the sun took it away.

This so completely amazing to me since none of my other relationships were real.  This is important, serious, unique.  What can I say...I'm happy.  Perhaps the happiest I have been all year, or all my life.  I know some of you worry about me but right now, I'm in a good place.  I hope to stay in this utopia for a good long while.  I love you all."

When everyone gets back into town ill have to show my fine work.  So i cant wait to see the narnia movie especially since i reread the book.  i think tomorrow ill go and see the aeon flux movie.  it'll give me a chance to get out of the house for a bit.  too bad they dont sell coffee at movie theatres.  hey thats actually a good idea.  maybe ill start my own theatre that does.  hmm. im rambling.  i guess ill go find something to watch on tv. how dull."

"event","Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free
I'm following the path GOd laid for me.
I took His hand when I heard Him call
I turned my back and left it all.

I could not stay another day
To laugh, to love, to work or play.
Tasks left undone must sty that way.
I found that place at the close of day.

If my passing has left a void
Then fill it with remembered joy.
A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss.
Ah yes, these things, I too, will miss.

Be not burdened with times of sorrow.
I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow.
My life's been full, I savored much
Good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.

Perhaps my time seemed all too brief;
Don't lengthen it now with undue grief.
Lift up your heart and share with me
God wanted me now, He set me free.




This conforts me sometimes.  Other times nothing seems to.  Life seems so meaningless.  I'm fine most days.  Nights are dreadful.  I'm sick of being monitored by my relatives.  I just want to curl up and sleep for centuries.  Don't feel bad for me.  I'm strong. You'll see. I'm strong."

"event","So I am now back at college.  It's so bizarre to be here again.  My friend and roomie put streamers and balloons in my room.  Also, they got lots of people to put inspirational things on index cards.  So they are covering my walls.  I thought that was pretty sweet.  Thankfully, I was able to finally open my box from my sister.  It contained like a billion presents including a costume of alice in wonderland.  I wore it tonight despite it being in the fourties outside.

Its nice that people are realizing Im back and they are giving me hugs but...I feel so alone now that im not with my family.  I brought some things of my dads so I can remember him but I still feel cut off.  I feel like I will shortly forget my huge tragedy not because I will have gotten over it but because there is so much other junk to preoccupy me.  

Most days I am pretty stable (visibly speaking).  At the most random times, I'll remember some memory concerning my dad and it will make me cry.  Noone really notices when this happens and the sadness soon passes.  I guess this is what they meant when they said the pain wont go away but lessen in time.  

I feel like jumping off the bluffs everytime I think of the homework I have to catch up on.  Its now more important than ever that I get good grades because I need the scholarship.  Living takes so much strength and I feel weak.

This must be the longest post Ive written in some time.  I guess I'll sleep or find where everyone is hiding.  Thanks to all who have me in their prayers."

    Principia College #49
    1 Maybeck Place
    Elsah, IL 62028

So I have finally started classes.  It feels so good to get into the swing of things.  My first class is called people of courage.  I really love me teacher because he is this lil old british man who gets so super excited when teaching.  Corresponging with that course, I am taking...ASTRONOMY!!! I love it.  I am so happy to be taking that class.  The teacher is also my advisor.  Finally, I am taking Chem.  So are all science teachers a lil crazy? Yeah I think so.

So my social life you ask. haha haha hahah.  Well I have tons of guys friends.  I find it easier that way because guys arent as high maintanence as girls.  I have been not obsessing about the guys I posted about earlier.  It could just be my overactive imagination but I think he is paying more attention to me now.  Who knows? Who cares?  There is another guy here that I took pity on because my friend dumped him harshly.  I thought that he was fairly attractive (and Canadian) so I kinda flirted with him.  One night during a movie, he held and played with my hand.  Perfect right?

HELL NO

Turns out he has been ""playin"" a lot of girls.  I do not like being on someones LIST!  Anyway we had a long talk and now it is my job to tell him when hes being a cocky asshole.  basically all the freakin time.  So for now there is no interest there romantically but I do like the fact that he can confide in me.

Well I better go seeing as I have to read 47 more pages on Mandela. Night to everyone. I miss you all so much.  I talk about ya'll all the time.  You're in my heart."

I met a lot of interesting people here.  Muchos chicos guapos. mmm.  I register for classes tomorrow.  I am taking a course called people of courage along with an astronomy and chemisty class this quarter.  I am really excited about starting actual classes and upper classmen move in on friday.  
    My friend Tiffany and I started a new task here.  We go around to all the guys dorms we know and leave them postit messages on their doors.  They seem to really like it.  I love to make a difference in people's days.  I am going to continue doing this in the weeks to come.  It also gives me a chance to go by my crushes room.
    Yes, I know. Crush already.  Well listen...he is a musician who plays guitar, bass, and drums.  He is funny, cute, with beautiful blue eyes.  The only problem is that he has known a girl here since like he was ten from camp.  He seems to like her a lot but I don't think she likes him in that way.  All the same, he flirts with me sometimes so I won't give up yet.  I don't have it in me too.  I am trying to just treat him like a friend and let the rest just fade away.
    I'm sure there is plenty more that I could write but the others are watching a movie (surprise, surprise).  I promise to update again soon. love ya'll. ps. Im trying to get everyone to start saying ya'll, lol!"

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.
I hope you had the time of your life.

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. 
I hope you had the time of your life.

In other news, I treated myself to a starbucks run today.  I could not have left for college without having my last caramel mach. Heck I might go back tomorrow.  The cute guy with the glasses was there.  He kept asking me if I wanted to try any food.  I only go there for the drinks and guys.  I brought my book on the history of phi so as to make me seem intelligent (plus I really like this book).  There were a group of men having a business meeting there.  It was so bizarre.  I did start listening when they were talking about their demographic and such and what models they wanted to use.  They kinda pissed me off a lil. ""Oh we're going for the cheerleading crowd not those boring girls.""  AHHHH.  You are all boring, old, creepy men.

Tomorrow my dad is taking off work to help me finish packing.  Oh ya'll who have started classes have given me hope.  You all seem to think the work is easy so Im going to stop stressing so much.  I will try my hardest to update on Friday.  Maybe my roommate will have a computer she doesnt mind sharing.  

Well, thats all thats on my mind. Oh Im going to start saying these thing (from my book):

     As soon as you awake, in order lay
     the actions to be done the coming day.

     Allow not sleep to close your eyes
     before three times reflecting on
     your actions of the day.  What deeds
     done well, what not, what left undone?"

I was trying to set them up with the two ushers but that didn't work very well.  Now everyone has left except my Aunt.  I'm pretty tired.  I did get my much needed starbucks today though. hehe.  I believe we are all going to see the Interpreter.  I'm sorry this all seems very disjointed.  I attribute it to my lethargic state of mind.  That's all for now.  Oh and I'm pretty much free from now on so leave me a message if you want to do anything.  At the very least, come over and help eat the remaining wedding cake.;)"

It kinda freaks me out to think about how everything I do now is going to really determine my future.  I'm not that worried even though I have to make at least a 3.5 gpa to keep my scholarship.  

So now that school is pretty much over, I need to see what everyone's plans are for the summer.  My goal is to never be home. lol. 

This is a completely lame entry.  GAH. heh. 


oh sidenote: Its very empowering not going gah gah over guys.  Im totally confident now.  Just thought I would share that minor achievement"

"event","My dad actually had the night off tonight.  It was so bizarre.  I promptly dropped all the plans I had for this evening and went out to eat with him.  We stopped at the phone store first and finally had my voicemail fixed.  I was especially grateful of this considering it hasn't worked for the past two months.  A few of the guys there apparently knew my dad quite well and told me I was lucky to be his daughter.  I hear that a lot actually. It's an ironic statement really, he seems to be there in everyones lives but mine.  So we went to eat.  I just started talking to my dad about everything and anything I could think of at the time.  I mean we hadn't had a real conversation in weeks.  It was nice to talk but at the same time it seemed he was not listening to what I was saying.  He had a margarita to ""relax himself"".  I think he depends too much on them and I think he should quit drinking completely.  I guess tonight was bittersweet but I am still appreciative of being in the same room with my dad for once."

There are a few things I do know I want.  I want to be successful, make a positive impact on the world, have a marriage that works if that is possible, and have lovely children.  I'm not even sure if I can accomplish these things. My mom seems to think I am not the marrying type.  What are the odds of finding the right guy.  Will I mess it up if I meet him?  hmm.  Well I was also thinking about how cut off I will feel in college away from the friends I love.  We all say that we will keep in touch but that just isnt realistic in the least.  I don't even know if I will have the internet.  Bottom line: My life is a changing and I fight change."

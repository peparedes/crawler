Aimee: like I'm just going to put online...

I can't really express it but all I can say is I want to give up a lot of things right now and just be a better person. maybe the whole september 11th thing has actually gotten to me.

(I think someone I know got some bad news today, and I feel for them. I hope to find out more so I can properly help them, I can tell it's bad but I can't tell how bad it is, so hopefully it's nothing life altering etc.)

I think me and Aimee are working in a positive direction right now, this also makes me happy (and gives me some hope) the bad news that surrounds her seems to pile pretty high some days and... I just want to hold her and tell her it will be better someday.

She's really one of, if not the most beautiful person I know... she's beyond a physical situation. I truly feel everything about her is beauty, and I hope more people can see / witness / experience as well.

I want everything in life to work out for the best..."

"event","Well, all good things must come to an end, and we did well (made it to the Semi Finals) but lost out. it was fun, and worth it while it lasted but... as for now, I'm just dandy with working 31 hours this week to cover RENT because I need that paycheck pretty badly. 

Now I get to lead a normal life for awhile. And I got to make a new friend this weekend, which rocks. I really hope my new friendship works out for the best too, just because it's cool to discover someone you've kinda know before but not really... I just think this situation has helped me understand Aimee's situation even more, so I feel I can grow from this as well.

That and, I'm a jerk, I don't seem to really appreciate anything... so that's my newest goal, appreciate everything because chances are it's all a gift.

that and I saw ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" and it was AMAZING! it was the first Broadway show i've seen since 2000 and it was well worth the TKTS line and price.

"event","NYC has been mostly fun again... so far. 

I've been hanging out with Kelly Buterbaugh in the city, she's a pretty fun girl. 

I flirted for twenty minutes with this girl at the Strawberry one act festival, we had a pretty fun conversation and Kathy and Tommy insisted that I got her phone number but she then slipped into the conversation ""my boyfriend"" and everything turned sour (as per usual) but Kathy really insisted that she was in to me. ha.

The Show was good but the Audience didn't seem to enjoy it. I'm guessing we won't be making it to the finals... but who knows

Dinner was OK... I didn't actually eat, but I drank (I believe a Granny Apple Ale) and played pool with Kathy.

Afterwards we went to the place on Broadway called the ""ROXY"" and had the most decadent brownie ever... I took a picture

then me and Kelly broke in the Milford Plaza Gym to Exercise... total time in GYM: 5 Minutes! 

now i'm sitting on the floor typing this to the chorus of Nick, Tommy and Kathy quietly snore... and I feel so very alone.

ahhh well, this too shall pass.
  

I might see a broadway show tomorrow... TKTS with a student ID can be pretty cheap...

we'll see."

"event","I've been revisiting a lot of my old books of lyrics and writings lately to try and figure out my mind frame. so anyway, here are some ""composed thoughts"" that have been in my head lately ... I originally wrote most of this in the summer of 2004 (most of the middle part etc.) but I updated now for the summer of 2005 because more things fell into place

the working title of this is ""inside of me""

<em>it's quiet now, you're fast asleep
there's nothing else you have to keep
away from me to tonight

I close my eyes, I drift away, 
but still the same, I can't hide these feelings
no matter what I feel, all I have is you 

but still the same, these thoughts I have
there not to strong, there not to brash
but all the same they belong to me, and everything I feel

So I'm sorry if I seem a little dismayed by you're truth now
It's just that every thing I have I attest to you, oh you
you know how I feel
you know what makes this real inside of me

hold on tight, though the night
might seem just to black tonight
there's a light, that I'm holding on to

it's just the lack of stars in this neon glow
where the light shines, there's nothing but
pain that can follow, same as I wallow
the pain that...

When this City glows, I have to know
that somewhere else, where you are
you will think of me before the night is over

before you're fast asleep and off to dream
that somewhere you will think of me and smile
and hope that I will follow

you oh you, you know how I truly feel
you what makes the fear inside my head spin oh...

it's quiet now, you're fast asleep
there's nothing else you have to keep
away from me tonight </em>

this is another one I was working on... it's called ""Betrayed"" which I'm still debating if i'll actually use for something. It was something I started to write at work one day when I was feeling kinda low about... everything. 
(this isn't very good right now)

<em>The Words / You Speak / Are Like Daggers To My Heart/
But The Thing / That Hurts / The Most / Is That You Mean Them All</em>

The Chorus, which I'm actually kinda happy with)

<em>See I've Been The One To Turn The Stone /
 I've Been The One To Ignore All The Problems /
I've Been The Source Of All The Pain / 
I'm To Blame, I Let You Down... oh

I Fear / It's All True / And These Words You Are Speaking Of Will Drive Me Desperate
And Now / Deep Inside / I Can't Help But Pray That These Words Are Just Lies...</em>

and then the final chorus would go something like...

<em>I'm Sorry If I Destroyed You're Trust / But Deep Inside You're Truly The Only One That I Love / I Know This Pain For You Has Been Too Much / I Feel Ashamed, I Betrayed You're Love... </em>

There would be / will be more to it if I continue on with that... it's just a device right now to help me figure out how much of a shit head I was / am about things... I mean, this sort of thing has always helped me cope and deal, I just usually don't share it with others (even though no one really reads *this* journal)"

I think all of these things are really hard, stressful situations that I'm really quite glad that I have this to work things out..."

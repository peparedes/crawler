"event","<P><FONT size=2>THIS HAS BEEN THE GREATEST WEEK OF MY LFIE!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Well, today was my dad's birthday and he had to work, so all day I just hung around and did chores because Roxy was at her grandmas house and Aleesa is in Fort Bragg and I couldnt see Kinzie cuz my mom wanted me to hang out with her for once in my life. lol. Then I baked my Daddy a yellow cake from scratch with this yummy homemade chocolate frosting and I ate so much cake batter i think i gained like 3 pounds. :-D Then he got home and someone at work gave him this plastic&nbsp;singing catfish and its so funny! Then we went out to eat at Red Robin, and we dont normally go there since its always crowded and expensive but we got to and I was soo happy it was delicious! And then we took a drive and it was the most beautiful nite with a breeze and this pretty song was on the radio and i felt so perfect just being there with my family..I wonder how many times im gunna feel like that bcuz im never really happy around my family. Ahh then I saw Kinzie outside and I waved at him and he smiled at me and I just remembered how much I&nbsp;loved him!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>And yesterday we hung out ALL day and first he came over and helped me and Roxy babysit Abby and his cousin J.D. was there and JD is 15 and he was bein really really annoying. AND THEN MY&nbsp;PARENTS CAME HOME!! AHH so I sort of got&nbsp;caught cuz they were like at the front door when my parents walked&nbsp;in thru the&nbsp;back door and it was scary. Even tho my mom&nbsp;didnt care my dad got super&nbsp;mad but he&nbsp;forgot about it. Then we all went to QuickStop and Kinzie bought me a soda he was bein a sweetie and then we went back to his house and we all hung out in the gameroom. AND HIS MOM WALKED IN THE GAMERROM WHEN I WAS SITTIN ON&nbsp;KINZIE'S LAP!!!!!! AHHH! And I thought she would like FREAK out cuz he's really not supposed to have a girlfriend, but she just started laughing and then ignored it and went back inside. It was weird. Oh well.

"event","<P><FONT size=2>I am so happy I could BURST!!!!!!!!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Okay, well on Sunday I tried to break up with Kinzie but we ended up having this talk and he said that the reason he was acting rude was cuz I was acting rude and I said that the reason I was acting rude was bcuz he was acting rude and it went on and on...but eventually he said ""I'm sorry that we had to go through that, I don't ever want to loose you. I won't ever act like that again."" So after that things started being A LOT better and now i think that i like him again, because everything he is doing is so sweet and so nice and we are so happy again...ahh its great. And even though i know that when things are going great something bad usually happends, I'm not afraid anymore. I don't know why but I'm just not. :-D WEll, yesterday was FUN! I babysat Abby frm 7:30am-1pm and Kinzie came over to help me babysit! She was being really good and she even took a nap so we just like watched tv and stuff...and anyway, then he went home at like 12:30 (bcuz he wasnt really supposed to be there, and i wanted him to leave before my mom got home) and then at 3pm Aleesa got home and since Roxette was at her Grandma's house, I hung out with Aleesa and Kinzie until 8. It was fun. We went on a walk with Abby and Sadie (my dog) and then&nbsp;we dropped Abby off and we went on a walk with just Sadie all around the whole neighborhood. And Kinzie even held my hand :-) Then we got back home and I showed Kinzie and Aleesa how to play ""The Reason"" on the drums, and then we just sat on the couch in the gameroom and talked and had a nice time. Today he is goin to Roseville so I wont see him. But at 3 Roxy and I are goin to the mall and I'm gettin new earrings for babysitting Abby. They're black hoops that have a skull in the middle and say ""Boys"". (get it? Bad Boys?) Thennn I dunno what we'll do but I miss Kinzie :`(&nbsp;Oh well. LIFE GOES ON!!!!!!</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>Well i havent updated in awhile. its been hard, ive just been busy, i dont feel like writing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>maybe if I stop writing everyone will think I died. maybe i should just die. curl up and die. i dont know. everything is pointless anymore.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>i am trying to break up with kinzie but its impossible because he is never home. so i dont know wut to do bcuz he doesnt answer my calls and&nbsp;he's not home. But the day i see him i am ending it. for sure. i dont even like him anymore. and i mean it this time. i think i can do this.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>and redmond. oh, redmond redmond redmond. the redmond who ive secretly (ok maybe not so secretly) liked since the day i met him. Member when I wrote in here, the nite i went over to Roxy's to watch ""IT""? Thats when I met him. Before me and Kinzie were even going out. But i never thought I'd EVER have a chance with him. Well, I started hanging out with him more and we'd flirt A LOT. and I asked him, ""If you ever broke up with Brittany and I&nbsp;broke up with Kinzie, would we ever go out?"" and he'd say, ""Yea, probably"" and so then about a week ago he was like ""Member that conversation we had about if I&nbsp;broke up with brittany and u broke up with kinzie?"" and I was like ""Yeah."" and he was like ""Do you still feel that way?"" and&nbsp;so I&nbsp;told him yes and he said he did too. Then he said&nbsp;that he was breaking up with brittany and that he wanted to go out with me. So, stupid stupid me, I get my hopes all up and get excited about this, then i find out that he is too chicken to break up with her. He&nbsp;has a good reason, too. SHE DOESNT DESERVE HIM! He is&nbsp;the sweetest, nicest, greatest guy I have ever met and she is&nbsp;always hurting him, and being rude to him and&nbsp;she&nbsp;never has&nbsp;enough time for him.&nbsp;But he can't see that. He knows&nbsp;that she hurts him. But he thinks she's going to change. I&nbsp;told him I would never hurt him. I told him that &nbsp;i couldnt live without him. He seemed really really sorry and he said he had feelings for me but he couldnt break up with brittany cuz he has really fallen for her. Then he talked to Roxette and he told her that not breaking up with Brittany was the stupidest thing he has ever done! So I am soooo confused! And my heart is being jerked around here and I cant take it. I wish he would just make up his mind! He told me ""You and Brittany are both really great ppl and im sure i would&nbsp; be happy with both of you I just dont know what I should do."" I am so sad about this. I really am. I like him so much. Ah whatever.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I have to go bcuz roxy is&nbsp;going to call me at 12 so we can have our&nbsp;late nite talk. My cousin and I used to have late nite talks. Wutever happend to those, justine???&nbsp;*thinks about the good old days*&nbsp;ok g2g guys</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>So today was a really lazy day. I already miss Roxette and I wish that Brianna lived in Yuba City. The lock-in at Youth Group is on Wednesday and I'm not sure if I want to go. I haven't gone in like 3 months and I wonder if anyone I know really well is going to be there. I think I'll go, and just make the best of my week without my best friend. I went online and watched like 26 episodes of Boy Meets World today, then I babysat Abigail for a couple hours and Aleesa came over when she got home at like 4. We were sitting on my porch playing with Abby when Kinzie rode by on his bike and I am like ""Hey!"" and he came&nbsp;over and talked to us for a little while but he had to go inside at 6pm cuz he was out too late last&nbsp;nite with me. (um.. nine thirty is too late? He usually stays out until eleven.) And&nbsp;he wasn't being mean but he wasn't being nice either. I mean, he wasn't acting like he cared that much about me and I almost started crying because i was making an extra special effort to be nice. So then when he went in, Aleesa&nbsp;and I walked around the block a couple of times and talked about it and&nbsp;we basically came to the conclusion that i was going to break up with him. (I was getting pretty upset) and we decided he needs to learn how to be respectful to girls and he cant just let his mood swings get in the way of our relationship. So we sat out in front of Dave (my neighbor's) house and talked more about it, and as I got all of my courage to break up with him, he rides by on his bike again (he had to get somethin from his dad's house for his mom) and he stopped and talked for a while and he was actually nice then. He said, ""That's a cool shirt, Emily."" (I had changed shirts.) and thats weird bcuz he never ever compliments me. (cuz yes, he is a&nbsp;jerk)&nbsp;And then he had to go but i had totally lost all nerve because those stupid green mesmorizing eyes made me loose all confidence. Ugh i hate myself rite now for giving him another chance because he doesnt deserve it. He really needs to treat me better. I wish I wasnt such a chicken.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I have to get a physical at the doctor tomorrow and i am really mad about that bcuz i hate those things and i hope i dont have to take my clothes off or anything cuz I am NOT.</FONT></P>"

"event","<font size=2> This morning me and Brianna woke up at 5am to watch the sunrise before she left. We got dressed and snuck out of the house when everyone was asleep, and then we snuck into Kinzie's backyard and we kept knocking on his window (he knew we were going to watch it this morning) but I guess we didnt wake him up cuz he didnt answer us. So me and Bri went back to my house and sat on the back of the pickup truck and watched the sunrise. Then at six we went back home and back to sleep until seven thirty when we woke up and got dressed and then her mom came at nine to pick her up.

 And Justine is still at Cheer camp until Tuesday and I just heard that something bad happend to her Grandma (she's really sick) so my mom says she might not be coming out to stay with us so I am really upset about that. Because my party is in the 31st and we really really need some cousin time! So basically everything is falling apart right now and it really sucks. 

p.s.-i really want to give kinzie another chance but he was just so rude to me last nite and it makes me really mad. And talking to him doesnt work, because he is always like, ""What the heck are you talking about? I dont notice anything wrong with our relationship!"" It's too much work to try to break up with him but it hurts to stay with him. And I really really do want to stay friends because we have a lot of good times together as friends (seriously I mean that). He makes me laugh a lot and everything, but he's just not serious enough for a relationship and he doesnt know how to treat me right now."

"event","Yesterday I saw Cinderella Story with Roxy and Bri, then me, Roxy, Bri, and Alan watched The Butterfly Affect, Glass House, and POTC at Roxy's house. Kinzie couldnt come for some stupid reason but we talked on the phone for a little bit which was okay. Me and Brianna were really hyper though so we were going crazy and it was really fun. 

Today we went to the mall for like 3 hours with Alan (again). I have never had a more boring time at the mall. I had no money and I talked to Kinzie on the phone again but he still couldnt come to the mall for another retarded reason. Then my Mom picked us up and we went to Jamba Juice and I got a Peach Passion (hehe Roxy). And when we got home Brianna and I hung out with Kinzie from like 6-10pm and we had these really nice talks about like everything and I was learning a lot about him and we were having a good time but he wasn't sitting next to me for some reason, and then i was talking about how the sun rises over Aleesa's house and he was like, ""No it doesn't there are houses in the way."" And we got in this argument about where the freaking sun rises and then he was like ""I'm not even going to argue with you! You're just like my mother! And that's NOT a good thing."" And I just stared at him. That really bothered me for some reason. Then we talked about Justine and I told him how it bothered me that one time when he said that Justine was the only person he had to talk to, and he was like, ""well she is."" And i was like, ""Um, me and Brianna talk, you know."" and he just went, ""Ok..what's your point."" Ok, well apparently he DOESNT want to talk to me anymore and he was to be a smart ass and a jerk to me. I thought we were having such a good time too. And then we were sitting in the back of the truck looking at the stars, but he was like biting his nails. I mean, what an idiot! He could have done SOMETHING but it was sort of impossible for me to hold his hand or do anything else with his hand shoved up in his mouth. And he had this little pop gun that he kept shooting and it was scaring my dog A LOT so she was scratching on the windows and it woke my dad up so he made me take the dog outside on her leash so she wouldn't bark anymore, and I told Kinzie to stop popping the gun cuz it hurt her ears, but he popped it again cuz he thought it was funny. And Sadie (my doggy) was like having a seisure or something cuz it was so loud and I yelled at him and he was like, ""It was an accident!"" But he really didnt care and it made me want to steal that pop gun and beat him over the head with it. And then his dad was like ""Come inside, Kinzie"" and he just ran away with like a little ""bye"" and he didnt even do ANYTHING. Not even a hug. So I was really really confused about that. Especially since we just had that talk on Friday about it and he said he DIDNT want to break up and he said he still liked me! I really really cant handle his mood swings and if he cant control the way he wants to treat me then maybe this isnt working out."

"event","<P><FONT size=2>YAY! BRIANNA IS HERE!!! Today&nbsp;we went to the park with Kinzie and Shelby and Roxy, and then we went swimming at Roxy's house from like 9-11pm. Kinzie didnt do ANYTHING then (which surprised me&nbsp;A&nbsp;LOT) and we&nbsp;were sort of fighting the whole day because he was in&nbsp;this awful mood and it was really hot so&nbsp;I was being mean to him.&nbsp;Him and Shelby walked us to Roxy's&nbsp;house so me and Kinzie&nbsp;could talk and we stood in front of roxy's garage talking for a really long time and I&nbsp;told him how I dont like his mood swings and that he really hurts me when he acts like that. Then he said something ""bad""&nbsp;happened at his Grandma's house but he really cant tell me what it was and&nbsp;he was probably going to be in a bad mood for&nbsp;the rest of the month.&nbsp;And he also feels guilty about lying to his parents and&nbsp;dating before he's 16. (they're&nbsp;morman)&nbsp;so I was like, ""Then&nbsp;if you dont want to feel guilty, maybe we should break up"" and he was like ""No staying together is more important.""&nbsp;so nothing really got solved&nbsp;except I&nbsp;know he is in a&nbsp;bad mood for some reason. Then he kissed me goodnight, and I was all ""I love you"" and he didnt say anything!&nbsp;Okay so what happend to before&nbsp;when he&nbsp;couldnt STOP saying it? I just&nbsp;wish I knew what&nbsp;has gotten into him. Cuz basically nothing has been solved except i know that he has a reason for being so weird lately even tho i dont know what it is. Then me and Bri and Roxy swam for awhile which made everything better cuz being around my friends always makes me feel better but I'm still thinking about it right now.</FONT></P>"

We went boating! Yay it was so fun swimming in the lake. I've never done it before, and I kept feeling like things were brushing up against my feet and Jeneah and I were trying to scare the fishies away. lol. But it was extremely FUN! I'm glad Jeneah is hanging out with Evan cuz I did NOT like Greg but Evan is sweet and nice and so Jeneah, I approve if you wanna go for anything ""more than friends"". haha. So...wow. There is too much to say. I AM GOING OUT WITH KINZIE AGAIN! Last Sunday I asked him out and he said yes! This past week has been the best darn week of my entire life. He kisses me every day, now. And we go for walks and hold hands now, too. On Wednesday he watched The Haunted Mansion at my house with Alysa, Aleesa, and Nathan. On Thursday he went to the mall with Roxette and I and then on Friday he watched Spiderman with just me. Then Roxette and Alan (her bf) came over on Friday, too, and we all hung out. I've been having so much fun with Kinzie, and Roxette and I hang out a whole lot more now. The Summer has started out GREAT!!! And also...I saw Kinzie this morning but now he hangs out with Nick (ugh eww) and so he hasnt hung out with just me in a few days and it sucks cuz he is being an arsehole. I want to see him and kiss him and be with him, but apparently all he wants to do is be immature and throw stink bombs at people with Nick and his possee now. And tomorrow he is going to Arizona for a WHOLE week and I havent even kissed him since Friday so I miss him alot. But anyway, its okay cuz things are alright I guess. Ahh ive got to go now cuz Jeneah is spending the nite at my house and we're driving home now. Evan is leaving. Okay, bye Evan. Byebye everyone."

I hate the power and control over me that these freakin Nazis have. I am like in this little box and the walls are getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and i will never be able to escape. SOMEBODY TAKE ME AWAY!

I hate my house. No, i like the house I hate my home. I hate being here. I hate fighting I hate tension why cant everyone just get along why do people have to be so moody and mean. I hate this I hate it I hate it I hate it. I want to live somewhere else. I want Kinzie to be my friend instead of treating me like a pile of crud. I wish people would like me why can't I just get people to like me I dont understand what it is. I hate myself. I want to change. I want my life to change. 

I want us to have money. I hate it that we can't even pay our freaking phone freaking bill. I hate that some people have it all but they just cant have enough. They have to start jacking up my life too. Taking everything I was proud of and everything I was happy about just for their own FREAKING PLEASURE because they dont want me to be better than them. They are ONLY HAPPY WHEN I AM SAD AND DEPRESSED. I HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT. They are so afraid that I am going to be better than them so they take everything. Everything."

I woke up late and Mom and Dad were already at Target so I took a shower but when I got out I realized I didn't have a towel, so while I was walking (butt naked) in the hallway getting a towel out of the cupboard, none other than Alysa and Nathan are sticking their heads in the window ringing the doorbell. lol!! ow so yah Alysa saw me. haha. 

And then we hung out with Kinzie for a bit and this one time Nathan was throwing darts at him (the magnetic kind) and I was all ""Hey look he has a target"" I meant to poke the ""Independent"" logo on his shirt but I accidentally poked his titty it was so funny. ha ha. Then we ate lunch at his house and his mom made yummy cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and then he bought us snow cones from the icecream man. yum!

Then Alysa and Nathan had to go to town with their Dad so Kinzie and I rode to Quickstop on our bikes and he bought a slurpie. lol Then we rode home. It was fun.

All in all-a good day.

Now I am babysitting Abby and at 3:30pm I have my last meeting with my advisor teacher person to turn in ALL my work and my books, and then I am still supposed to do school until June 9th, but I bet you a million bucks that after today I won't do anymore school.

"event","<font size=2>wow....today was the best darn day of my life. I had the most fun EVER!!!!! Okay @ 9 Aleesa came over and we got ready and then we picked up Kinzie and we all drove to Sunsplash and when we got there at like 10:30 (since i won the thing on the radio) they let us in thirty minutes before the park opened! So there was just us and a few other winners and we had the whole park to ourselves with noooo lines! IT WAS SO FREAKING AWESOME! But Aleesa didn't want to go on Stormrider so Kinzie and I went on it twice (its a four person ride) so we rode it with these two old people who smelled. But it was still so FUN. 

And then Aleesa got to pick the ride next and she picked like those Twin Twisters that are so not fun while I'm riding it I am thinking in my mind ""This is the most boring ride ever!"" But Aleesa is my friend so I rode it with her. So then Kinzie, Aleesa and I go on the Stelth (scariest ride there!) and Aleesa and I both rode on a two person tube and Kinzie rode on a one person tube and then Aleesa went over to the wave pool and sort of ditched us and then Kinzie and I decided we wanted to go on every ride they had four times. 

So first we went on The Revolution which is just like Stormrider except its smaller and its a one- or two-person ride. But we rode on the two-person tube and you know how u sit when u sit on a two person tube. I am laying in his lap for the whole ride! And then we rode the Black Hole (one person) and then we went on Master Blaster. THAT IS THE BEST FREAKIN RIDE THERE! It is like a rollercoaster it goes like 40 MPH and it goes straight down then shoots u straight up and its all wobbly and FUN! We rode that in a two person tube four times and then we rode the Stelth again in a two person tube like three more times and then we just rode a hundred other slides a bunch of times. But Aleesa totally didn't hang out with us at all (she was having much more fun doing whatever she was doing..she actually ditched US I mean we didnt leave her out she just wanted to leave! But oh well, FINE with me that just means more alone time for me & him!) And like the lines were so long once the park really opened that we were in line for 20 minutes minimum and that just left us time to talk and talk and laugh and ride the rides together and woah..i dont know but just woah thats all I can say. 

Then we met these two kids and it was soooo funny because the one kid was like to Kinzie, ""Is your name Chad?"" and then Kinzie was like, ""Yes"" and then they kept saying all this stuff and it was just hilarious. So the guy is like to Kinzie, ""Who's your girlfriend?"" (pointing to me) And Kinzie is like, ""What?"" and he goes, ""What's your girlfriend's name?"" and he was so incredibly uncomfortable i could so TELL and he kept changing the subject and saying 
""My name really isnt Chad.""
""Ok no but is she your girlfriend?""
""My name really isnt Chad.""
""Man quit changing the subject is she your girlfriend?""
""My name really isnt Chad.""
So finally the guy looks at me and I am laughing really hard (I am not uncomfortable AT ALL) and the guy is like, ""Are you his girlfriend?"" and I am like ""No."" And he said, ""Brother and sister?"" ""No."" ""Cousins?"" ""No."" ""Oh just friends?"" ""YES!"" lol poor kinzie he looked so uncomfortable. We talked to them for so long and then they were like ""We want to go on the four person ride but there is only two of us. You guys wanna go with us?"" So we rode it with them and then they kept like stalking us around the park and it was so funny. Then when they left and we went to go ride Master Blaster again the kid yelled something at Kinzie and I didnt hear and I am like ""Whatd he say?"" and Kinzie is like ""he said.....ummm..well like"" he was not saying it! And I am like, ""God Kinzie just tell me what he said!"" And Kinzie is like ""He said 'Thats really your girlfriend, Man'"" and I just laughed. Gosh, Kinzie just needs to loosen up and get over it. Its not uncomfortable to talk about when we used to go out. lol. Man, it was funny. 

Then we ate lunch with Aleesa and then all three of us rode rides together and then we went home at 6! The car ride home was just as fun as the ride there. Even funner. Picture this: All of us in the back of a small foreign car. Me smushed in the middle right next to Kinzie. Yes, it was heaven. I dont think I ever laughed MORE. My dad and Kinzie seemed to have like, this connection or something because half the time they were laughing with eachother so hard and i was laughing at THEM because they had really funny sounding laughs. Then I dont know, we just talked and laughed and were serious and oh, wow i loved it!! YAY i am so happy!

and my ""situation"" was solved. For those of you who are wondering.

OK LUVZ 2 ALLLLL!!! I wish I could rewind this day and go back to the beginning just so I could experience it all over again."

So she can go to Sunsplash with me tomorrow and so can Kinzie but Alysa was gone and as soon as she got home I was like ""Dad lets go ask Alysa"" and he said ""Well I dont want to have to take four kids there!"" So I wasn't ALLOWED to invite her! AHH now im mad. Well, Kinzie and ALeesa and I are going to have an incredibly FUN time tomorrow!!!!!

Thus brings us to another issue....i dont see how in the heck i am going to wear a bathing suit or ride waterrides because its that you-know-what time of the month again and how exactly am I supposed to pull this off? So now I am HECKA confused and nobody is helping me and somebody HELP what do I do. Yea so I dont want to go into detail or anything so thats all I'll say.

Ok well that's about all I have to say except I'm also planning my birthday party and I'm not sure what day I'm having it on but it has to be on a day that Kinzie and Justine and Brianna can all come. (cuz they're the ones with the busiest schedules this summer!) darn them with stuff to do in the summer! Guess what I get to do? Babysit Abby while mom gets a *second* job. Yeah babies cost a lot of money ya know. 

Anywayz, back to the party. I was going to do rock climbing but then I deciced that I am going to have like a big dancing party and people can bring friends so we can have a bunch of guys there (haha that was Justine's idea) and Dad's actually OKAY with it!!! He was like, ""Yeah I did that on my thirteenth birthday.."" and he like, looked off into the distance like he was remembering....LOL so anyway, it's going to be a big BBQ (tofu dogs for me! LOL) and there's going to be dancing under the stars and it's going to be soooo cool. Wow. Alrighty now I'm excited for my bday!

But I also have one problem with going to Sunsplah tomorrow....ugh im sure nobody really wants to hear about it but now I dont want to go because of...erm mind blowing cramps but I have to go still. And I absolutely do not know what to do. WHY DID GOD MAKE ME A GIRL? Alright its not all that bad. GiRLS ROCK!"

Well, today was a normal day just hanging out with Kinzie and Aleesa and Alysa except Nick came by with his ""Gang"" and said he wanted to beat Kinzie up but we started just insulting eachother and Nick is such a loser he cant even come up with good comebacks and I was like ""Nick why are you such a sissy you couldnt even come by yourself without your 'gang' to help you"" and he goes, ""Oh these two guys? They're homos!"" (ok...) and I am like ""Yeah you guys have a threesome, huh?"" and he said something really stupid and then he went to go hit kinzie so they like start to fight and then Nick is such a little whimp that he just called kinzie a sissy and ran away and kinzie didnt really hit nick because like all the parents were watching. So then Nick comes back with a whole bunch of guys and they started playing basketball on kinzies hoop and going into his gameroom (the garage) just to piss him off so i go run off to get some eggs to throw at them so they'll leave us alone, and when im running away Bill (hes like 15..i used to have a crush on this guy) yells ""YOU RUN LIKE A GIRL!"" (it was so totally stupid) so I flipped them off and then I ran and got the eggs and as I was running back Nick stood right in front of me and he was like ""Lets play basketball"" and I am like ""No, Nick get out of here"" and he is like ""Come on.."" and I was like ""LEAVE right now!"" and he wouldnt move so I shoved him and he hit the tree and fell on the ground!!! WOAH OMG....so I just ran into kinzies garage and finally kinzies dad came out but he didnt tell the guys to leave (HE THOUGHT THEY WERE HERE BECAUSE THEY LIKED ME!!) LOL and then when they saw Kinzie's dad they left. They are probably never going to come back here again. Oh..my...gosh though. I cannot even think about what to do! I feel sort of guilty for hurting Nick. But I shouldnt! Because he's a jerk and he was trying to fight Kinzie!
Alright now I am confused. Even though it felt good to hit Nick. Is that bad? Alright I dunno I think this is my conscience speaking but I am not going to listen to it! Nick isnt going to mess with us again. I am through with him. GOOD. Alrighty now I am just too excited to go to sleep....too much stuff happend! Ok I didnt want to have to come home I had too much fun being with my FRIENDS. Kinzie is the greatest friend ever! And so is Alysa! And Aleesa didnt act like a brat today, I actually had fun with her! What is going on with the world lately??"

"event","<font size=2>Hey everyone! Well, yesterday was cRaZy! Aleesa had to go to youth group early (AMEN!) so Alysa and I could hang out by ourselves. Kinzie was studying and we thought he was in the gameroom, so we snuck up to the window and we were looking through it and right when we turned to go home his mom was like, ""Hi girls."" She had been standing right behind us the whole time! It was sooo funny I was just laughing so hard I couldn't help it for some reason. And then she was talking to Alysa about her birthday party and I looked like a total ditz just standing there trying to muffle my laughter while they actually had an intelligent conversation. Alysa always does the talking when we talk to his mom. She probably thinks I'm some kind of idiot. lol. 

So then whenever kids would come by on their bikes we would yell ""Woo-woo!"" and ""OW!"" and ""SPICY!"" Just being complete idiots and it was just so funny because they were mostly really really ugly guys that we would say that to and then they would get all happy it made us crack up. Then Kinzie studied in the gameroom so he could stare at us through the window and we kept doing all this stuff like giving him the peace sign (which in Austrailia means 'Up Yours') and the ""OK"" sign (which in France means 'Your worthless') and then we were blowing kisses and it was so funny i think he got zero work done.

Then Nathan grabbed my....female parabollas again for what? The TENTH time this week? And Alysa and I already had this big talk with him about it but he did it again so Alysa walked over to him and started yelling at him and she was like ""Either I am going to deal with it or HE is going to deal with it!"" (pointing to their dad) and Nathan was like terrified when she said that because his dad would have gotten MAD so now I dont think he is going to do it again. GOOD.

Okay so now I am babysitting Abby and I am about to die because she is screaming and she won't go to sleep even tho she's really tired and I am even more tired and hungry and the cat is knocking over the fish bowl so basically life is complete chaos at the moment. SOMEBODY COME SAVE ME!"

Saturday is Sunsplash day! WOOOHOO! Check out the <a href=""http://www.norcalcoasters.com/news.php?id=0525045""> <b>Pics</b> </a> of the new waterslide that I'm gonna get to be the first to ride! Wow I'm really excited now. 

Oh and its getting on my nerves how Mom STILL keeps saying stupid stuff about me and Kinzie. WHEN IS SHE EVER GOING TO STOP? GOD i am SICK of it! Doesn't she get it? It just makes things like 100000000 times worse for pete's sake! Oh well. I'll just stop hanging around the house so she'll stop saying crap like that. But I am sick of Alysa and Aleesa, too! Ugh!! Ok maybe I'm the one with the problem. I dont know.

Gosh the only person who I like hanging out with now is Kinzie because he isnt so annoying like the rest of them. Maybe I'm just sick of having girls as friends because they're all so emotional and when you have three weepy females in the same room we all don't get along very well. 

Especially since I'm the only single one in the whole group. I am sick of hearing about their boyfriends. Even Nathan and Lenette are so ga ga it drives me nuts! If I hear the name ""Brannan"" one more time I am going to SCREAM! Aleesa GET A GRIP ur turning into a puddle of JELLO! Ok now I know im being sort of hypocritical because thats exactly how I was about Kinzie a few weeks ago and it drove everybody nuts. But now I know how annoying I must have really been and I'm SORRY all of y'all who had to put up with me! But just as soon as I get Kinzie off the brain Alysa is now NUTS for him so I have to hear HER jabber on and on about him now! Ok well ive got to go take a shower but luvz 2 yall and especially to those of u who have to put up with PDA and cutesy-poo cupples."

"event","<font size=2>YAY!! Ok today must be my really lucky day because I just was on the radio!!! On 107.9 they have this contest where you keep track of the TR-09 countdown and then be caller #17 and tell them all the songs that were on the countdown. Well I was keeping track and i thought what the heck I'll just call, and the first time I called I was caller #3 but then i thought i'll try one more time and i was caller #17 and I WON!!!! I won the new Avril Lavigne CD before it even came out, and I won tickets to Sunsplash on Saturday. I'm going to be the first in the nation to ride the new Storm Rider ride and my personal escort down the slide is going to be Maney from The Morning Rave (radio show on 1079)!! WOW ok so i am like really excited right now. YAY! I wonder who I am going to take to Sunsplash. Maybe Megan and Kinzie! Ok I'll ask them. I dont wanna take Alysa cuz then everybody would be like ""Why didnt you invite AALLLEEESSAAA?"" And I hate her so I'm not going to get involved with that.

Ok, so Kinzie and I are doing this daily letter thing that Alysa and I do too. Every day when we're in class or after school before alysa's dad gets home and we aren't hanging out we just write these notes to eachother and they are soo funny we draw little cartoons of eachother and its really nice to get letters from him.

Oh yeah. I've been doing a lot of thinking this week about when i told him that i liked him and he so rejected me. I've been thinking about what is going on in these past few days, and how i told myself that i had to get over him. And I do. And I think I have. Because today when I saw him, I didn't feel so like, committed(..is that the word I mean?) to him. I didnt freak out when I had to go home, everything was just like really laid back and fun. I felt....friendship there. Nothing else. Everything just feels okay. And he's not really that ""SOO INCREDIBLY SEXY AND HOT"" like I thought before. lol. He's cute, thats about it. 

And another clue that tells me that I've moved on is that we talked about us going out as the ""past"" and there was no tension there. I told him about how my mom is so psycho and she bugs me everyday saying ""Emily you guys are still just friends, right?"" and ""Its really gross because he is younger than you, Emily...you really need to stop going over there everyday it just shows me that you haven't gotten over him"" and other B.S. like that! And u know what he said? He was like, ""Oh my gosh..did you tell her that that was NEVER going to happen again?"" and when he said that, i didnt have an ounce of hurt in me like i thought I would. I said, ""I know! I said 'Mom we aren't doing that anymore! We are just friends and thats how its going to be!'"" Ok enough about this..but things are looking good.

Yeah ok so i gotta go to sleep now bcuz i have to babysit Baby Abby tomorrow all day so luvz 2 all!!

"event","<font size=2>Well today was a very lazy day. Alysa was at the Rivercats game all day and I wasn't about to hang out with Aleesa or Lenette so I just hung around the house being annoying to my parents. lol. 

I watched TV then went to Target and Raleys with my mom (I got new flipflops they are so cute!) Then I talked to Justine for awhile and then Dad and I cleaned up the attic. Okay, he did most of it and i just played the piano most of the time. I taught myself a new song. It's that old song, Beautiful Dreamer. Okay, it was the only thing easy enough to play by ear besides Mary Had a Little Lamb or any Christmas songs I know. lol. So I played for a really long time until I had it down perfectly and then I noticed Alysa was home! 

So I talked to Nate and he said that Alysa was grounded :-( Then I saw Kinzie but he was talking to his parents and it looked all serious and i was scared to go over there and talk to him in case something was going on. So me and Nathan rollerbladed around the block a little while and then he fell and got glass in his knee!! So he needed stiches :-/ omg i felt sooo bad. 

Then I rode my bike aruond the block and went to the park and I saw Nick and he was all ""EMILY!!!!!!!!"" and I turned around to wave but I didnt see the sidewalk in front of me and i crashed! lol it was so embarassing but I was okay. Then I rode some more and came home and ate Perogies. YUM! 

So now I'm writing you and I've got to go play with Abigail because mom wants me to. ahhhhhh okay well im gonna go so C YA BABIES!"

"event","<font size=2> OK, so I'm a bit calmer now. Nothing like a good sleep and a anger-filled letter written to get all my feelings out. It definately made me feel better. I'm just sort of hanging low right now. 

Alysa came over for a while to see how I was feeling. We just hung out in my room and then she went to the park with Blondie. I am so mad @ Blondie I want to kill her. (not b/c she went to the park with Brooke and Alysa but for a lot of other things) Alysa hates her too. So I dont know why Alysa went to the park with her. What ever. I haven't talked to her in like four days. 

Faggot Boy was a no show today. He probably feels as bad as I do. At least, I hope he does. I'm just going to hang low for a little while. Then I'll figure things out. Alrighty time for din din.

luvz 2 all (accept for Q.B., P.B., and F.B. You know who you are)

p.s.- oh I just realized that I just have to get over Kinzie. I have to. I can't like him anymore. I am going to MAKE myself not like him. I know it wasnt meant to be so I have to stop telling myself that it was."

Uh-huh, right when I decided i was going to confess my love to him, I gave it all I had and told him how I really felt, then oh-BOY i find out he's chasing after TARA. And Alysa decided to flash me in front of him. Yes. The funny character that she is. She didn't even know what was going on she just walked rite up there and did that. Then she saw the look on my face. I was UPSET. And ummm a lot of other INTERESTING things that happend today that I'd rather FORGET but that I CANT FORGET because they are eating up my brain! I can't even type them i am so crazy right now. All I can do is pace around the whole house crying and over-thinking things like usual. I HATE THIS!! The main problem here is that I am so confused. I don't know what my feelings are, anymore. I am so....humiliated, rejected, distant, lost...I don't know what to do. What are the rules in this kind of situation? Should I even TRY to be his friend again? And Tara, TARA i just can't BELIEVE that. OH MY GOSH. OH MY FREAKING GOSH I AM IN DISBELIEF HERE. I am so stupid! OF COURSE he didn't have feelings for me! And being the stupid person that I was, I just made myself feel a million gazillion times worse because I had to hear those words from HIM. He doesnt feel anything for me. Yes. Lovely to hear it from Kinzie. My friend. Ok i am going to shut up now because i am just making myself feel worse.

I LIKE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT MY GOOD DAYS! YAY okay well i hung out with kinzie and alysa in his gameroom for a long time today. We talk about how i really feel about having a sister and how it feels to get kicked out of a clique. Boy do we both know a lot about those two things. Well, actually he doesnt have a baby sister but when his parents started the care home and he had to live with those retarded people....gosh that must have been HORRIBLE. I like talking to him. He's like the perfect person to talk to about anything. And those eyes....wow. They are like the dreamiest eyes i have ever seen. LOL but he's also a great listener and he's smart and mature. I can feel our friendship growing closer and stronger every day that we're together and it's wonderful. I know that when we did go out, we weren't ready to go out. Ya know how most relationships should start as friends, and then more? Well we started out as boyfriendf/girlfiend and then became friends. Now I know how important it is to be friends with the person first. So I feel like if we just keep getting closer and our friendship grows, it might grow into something more than a friendship. And then it will make a better relationship. Wow. I'm likin where this is goin. Okay, well it was a great day and I'm glad I spent it with Kinzie. I'll write tomorrow!</FONT></P>

Today Kinzie, Alysa and I had had this HUGE water fight! IT WAS SO FUN. We even filled up those rubber gloves with water and threw them at eachother. LOL. Then we went into Kinzie's house and he was in the bathroom changing (his clothes were all wet), so we went into his room and we stole his boxers. Then his mom came home and we were like ""OMG HIS BOXERS! GET RID OF THEM!"" So we had to throw them in his living room as we ran out the door. LOL OMG it was soooo funny. We fell on the ground on top of eachother laughing soo hard. I don't even know what his mom thought. Then we just hung out for lots more. The only thing I have to worry about now, is that his birthday party is on Saturday, and I dont know if I want to go. I mean, I'm not going to know ANYONE there. Aleesa might go. She MIGHT. Only if they get home in time from someone's house they are going to. Alysa cant go AT ALL.:( She is going to her Aunt's house to help them move. Well, i told him I am going. So I guess I am. Whatever. I can always go home, I know that.  But that would just be totally rude not to mention embarassing. AAHHHHHHHHHH WHY IS THIS SO HARD!! WHY CANT HIS STUPID PARTY BE ON ANOTHER DAY????? UGH OKAY I HAVE TO GO. Talk 2 yall later."

That kind of thing never happends. Although I bet after that my parents won't let me go to the park by myself anymore. Agh. Oh well. The park is over rated anyway. I'm eating some hashbrowns and toast. YUM! I am tired even tho it's 11:30. I woke up this morning at like eight, and I just laid in bed for a really long time because I just had NO energy to get up this morning. Friends is over. :( I'm gonna miss that show. Anyway, there's not much more to say. Aleesa, Alysa, and I have been hanging out with Kinzie and their parents know it but they don't care! <i>strange...</i> oh well. I like it like that! I wonder how long it will last. Oh, and I am going to stop trying to get back together with Kinzie. It's a waste of time. It never works, anyway. I'm giving up. I'll still always love him but I just can't take trying anymore. It hurts too bad. Yuck. I hate love. Well, I'll talk to y'all later. BYEZ!"

"event","OMFG!!!! Today Kinzie, Aleesa, Alysa, Lenette and I were all hanging out like normal. Then Alysa went out to eat with her family and brother. So, at about 8:30pm Kinzie, Aleesa, Lenette and I are just sitting out in front of my house and then we see this Mexican guy with no shirt on (may i remind u it is FREEZING outside right now) he is walking on the other side of the street. All of the sudden,he looks at Kinzie's house and walks across the street over to where WE are sitting, and he walks up to kinzie's front lawn and KICKS his cat! We heard this HUGE thump and then this lady who was walking her dog goes, ""YOU CANT JUST GO AROUND KICKING ANIMALS!"" And he started walking towards us and we got so scared we all ran into my house. Even though the moment was incredibly scary it was also very...i dunno but Kinzie is cute when he's scared and we sat really close by the window looking out to see when the guy had left. So the guy leaves, and then we go out there and tell Kinzie's mom, and they call the cops. And then when Kinzie and his mom came back home I was out front with my parents telling them the story (they had gone for a walk when this happend) and then Kinzie jumps out with his mom and they come and tell us that it turns out this guy is on
drugs and he has been walking around the neighborhood kicking ANIMALS and when Jon (our neighbor accross the street) tried to arrest him (hes a cop) the guy was FIGHTING him trying to get away! OMG it was sooooo scary. OK i g2g get off the computer now but I'll write more later."

"event","<font size=2>Well, first I'll talk about testing! YAY! I thought it was going to be HORRIBLE!! But naturally, everytime I think something is going to go bad it goes good. (and every time i think somethings going to go good it goes bad.) I met Chloe and Amanda. I ate lunch with them and today the P.E. test was a piece of cake! Chloe was in my group so we ran the mile together and talked about a whole bunch of stuff. The hour went by fast! We exchanged eMail addys and stuff so we can still talk every day. Megan, from church, is coming over on Saturday to spend the nite and we're going to see 13 Going On 30. Now, here's the really interesting news in friends: Kinzie came over on Monday and he and I had this long talk about Aleesa and Alysa's parents and how they cant hang out with him. We both decided we werent going to be a part of that crap and I am not getting into the cult-ways of ""the village"" any MORE. I am not going to Aleesa's house anymore. We can hang out outside and stuff, but those girls are not going to be my best friends. We're going to be friends, but if I get too involved, bad things are going to happen I just know it. But at least now I have Kinzie all to myself. He and I are going over to Carla's someday. (Aleesa and Liss are banned from seeing Carla, too!) And we are going to show them that we can hang out with whoever we want to. Aleesa's mom doesnt control me. Guess what, Virginia? I WOULD rather hang out with Kinzie than Aleesa! Because he is not a piece of shit! He is my best friend and we are going to hang out with Carla whether you like it or not. I have decided I am going to be friends with EVERYBODY. If Alysa cant play with someone well guess what? If they are my friend then I can and I am still going to play with them whether her parents like it or not. And I like Kinzie a lot more than Aleesa. In fact, I HATE Aleesa. I only hung out with her to be with Alysa, the one who was supposedly my really good friend. I am so confused as to who is my friend and who is not anymore. Whatever. At least I know Kinzie is my friend."

Today I did testing down at Sactown with a bunch of other homeschoolers and ""fine arts"" kids who I didnt even know. Funny thing, they all knew eachother and had a bunch of cliques and junk. I just sat there with no1 to talk to. It was easier today, cuz mom picked me up for lunch and we went to Bella Bru (YUM!) but tomorrow I have to eat lunch with the highschoolers and I am scared bcuz they're all crazy kids who got kicked out of their schools and thats why they're @ this school. The others are just dorks who got beat up 2 much at real school. I dont know WHICH category I fit into. I never got beat up, and i did get kicked out of school but it wasnt my fault. Oh well. At least I have friends at home. BUT I CANT STAND BEING HERE FOR TESTING! On Wednesday is Physical fittness testing and I have to do a bunch of junk in front of all these 15 year old 7th graders and I am like the only 12 yr old there. Its EMBARASSING. I dunno some ppl say i am overreacting and maybe I am, but i think i have anxiety disorder or something bcuz i get all self conscious and paranoid when im around ppl i dont know. Or maybe thats just how u feel when ur a teen. Who knows. I got to go to bed the parents are freaking out. More 2 say, but no TIME!! I'll write tomorrow. If I survive

And then we called Aleesa over and we talked and I think things are better with our friendship now. I feel much better about the whole thing, anyway. Aleesa's dad said that he thought it was stupid that Aleesa can't play with everybody on the block (meaning Kinzie). Well, at least one adult besides my mom agrees. I have a good feeling about the whole thing. Maybe her mom will come to her senses? I don't know. Things are looking better. I'll just stay optimistic. I'm writing more poems. I haven't posted any up here yet, but I might soon. I'm just too lazy at the moment. he he. I want to go see Mean Girls and 13 Going On 30 this weekend but I've got no one to go with.

Actually, I didn't know it was going to work out, and I felt pretty crappy about the whole thing for a long time. I mean, I still kindof do feel that way. Not all of the reashurrance that things are going to work out is here like it used to be. Well, lemme explain today. I came outside at like 5:00pm and everybody wanted to go swimming but me, so&nbsp;I just went home. Then later I came back outside and I saw Kinzie go to take out the garbage so&nbsp;I went and got&nbsp;Alysa and Aleesa and told them&nbsp;that we should go run to&nbsp;Alysa's house (right across the street from Kinzie's) so he would see us and come outside.&nbsp;So we went over there and Nathan runs in Kinzie's yard and grabs Ponny Po Po (kinzie's cat) and Kinzie was like starin at us thru the window&nbsp;so we&nbsp;waved&nbsp;at him&nbsp;and then he opens the door but he opens it so just his head is peekin out from the side of the door (its coverin his whole body). And I am like, ""What is he naked or something?"" Then he moves and&nbsp;he didnt have his shirt on and I laughed really hard&nbsp;bcuz he wont let us see him wit his shirt off cuz he thinks he's fat or somethin (HE IS SO NOT! HES got a SEXY body!) so then we laughed at him and he finally came out with a shirt on but Alysa's mom had just got home so she only had a few minutes to hang out with us. And Aleesa was like, ""Well&nbsp;he can't be over here, remember?"" and Alysa and I just stared at her and she goes, ""Remember I am not allowed to play with him?"" So I just took a deep breath and said, ""Well Alysa is allowed to hang out with him and this is <EM>her</EM> property."" She </FONT><FONT size=2>just looked at me for a long time and then I went to go tell Kinzie what was going on, and when I looked back at her she was walking back to her house. You know what? I don't even care. Even though I bet you that Aleesa told her mom again and Alysa's mom is going to talk to her mom and I really really hope Alysa doesn't get banned from seeing him anymore. Cuz if she does I dont know what I'll do. But we're both really really mad at Aleesa. She is making us SO ANGRY!&nbsp;I don't even know&nbsp;what's going to happen next. Well I guess I'll have to just wait and see. But I am&nbsp;sort of happy cuz every time that I see Kinzie (even if it's&nbsp;only for a few minutes) It makes me HAPPY. :-)"

"event","<FONT color=#cc66cc size=2>Okay, maybe it doesn't seem like such a big deal to some people, but when Kinzie found out Aleesa couldnt play wit him anymore he thought that meant I couldnt be his friend either so now he doesnt come outside AT ALL. Alysa and I are mad at Aleesa because she lies to her mom and gets us in trouble. We cant be mad at her for fear she'll ruin our lives. That's not what a friendship is and I'm sick of living like her slave. We decided to ignore her and we're going to Kinzie's party. Even though our parents are bound to get into this mess sooner or later because they're all BEST FRIENDS. This is more than just one person not being able to talk to someone else. It's like hard to explain, but there's this thing they call ""the village"". The group of families where the dads are best friends, the moms are best friends, and the kids are best friends. I hate being in ""the village"" because it's like we get too involved in eachothers lives. They have friends, they have enemies. We all have the same friends and enemies. I want to be friend's with their enemies, but because the other members of the village aren't friends with the other families who arent a part of the village, that means that I can't be friends with them. What kind of crap is that? I dont want to have to listen to my friend's parents! But because we're all attached like in this group of neighbors and friends, if you're out of the village, you're out. We dont talk to you. I've lost two friends this way and I'm sick of it. Could I be next?? Could my mom get mad at Aleesa's mom and then ban us from playing with eachother? One minute I could loose all of my friends because their parents try to control their lives. Alysa and I have decided this is NO way to live! It's all Aleesa's stinking fault that just when we were building a great friendship with Kinzie she tries to ruin it because she was jealous. We're NOT her friends anymore. In other news: I am flunking math, my Dad thinks I need psychiatric help just because I was talking to him about pot and how Brandon smokes it. (He actually asked me if Kinzie and I did! FOR PETE'S SAKE!) I cry all the time because I can't control my life, and I have to babysit Baby Abby tomorrow ALL day. I don't think I can take this any more. I hate dealing with this. Why can't things just go BACK to the way they used to be! I havent seen Kinzie in a long time. I need to see him because he always makes me happy. Right now I am SAD. :(</FONT>"

That's exactly how I feel right now. I'm extremely mad at Aleesa and Aleesa's parents. Maybe even a little bit at Alysa and myself. Well, Aleesa is a selfish little crybaby of a friend who goes and tells her mommy when she felt ""left out"" instead of talking to us about it and now guess what? Aleesa isn't allowed to play with Kinzie anymore, and since Aleesa and Alysa's moms are like best best friends, Alysa can't play with Kinzie when Aleesa is around because ""Alysa acts differently to us when she's around Kinzie"" And since the only time Alysa can hang out with him is when Aleesa isn't around, she basically is not going to be hanging out with him any time soon because Aleesa is never NOT outside! And I liked him hanging with Alysa and I. I dont really hang out with him just by myself. I mean, sometimes I do, but basically I'll have to be making a decision like, ""Who do you like better? Kinzie or Alysa and Aleesa?"" How am I supposed to pick? I dont like Aleesa at the moment even though I barely show it. I still act like her best friend, but deep inside I am burning with anger towards her. How could she do this? She's just SELFISH and she wanted to get back at us because we were having fun with Kinzie and she is such a party pooper she didnt want to join in. That's not my fault! And I thought I actually had friends who CARED about me. I tried talking it out with them, and they were like, ""Who cares, anyway? I wont miss him."" HELLO!!!!! BUT I WILL! They know how I care about him, but they are not doing anything to show that they care about ME. I'm almost in disbelief that this is happening. I can't take it! I can't! Everything was going PERFECT. He was coming to Alysa's pool party, I was going to his birthday party, and then today we were going to go to his house and see his room! Our friendship was mending! THINGS WERE WORKING OUT! Why is this happening? Not to me, not now! This can't be happening! Now Alysa can't invite him to her party because Aleesa's mom will throw a hissy fit and Alysa's mom will listen to her, now I can't go to his party because if Alysa doesnt go I can't go. I don't want to go by myself and be around all of his friends that I don't know! I need my friends! Right now more than anything I need my friends but I don't see them anywhere. I feel so distant from them. I feel distant from everybody."

"event","<P><FONT size=2>yay! I was right, today was a WONDERFUL TERRIFIC FRIDAY!!!! Well, if I wrote it all I may never get to sleep and this entry would be pages long, so I'll sum it up a bit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>First, Alysa got home early (cuz it's FRIDAY!) so we hung out and when Kinzie didn't come outside and we saw his parents leave we decided to go knock on his door and ring the doorbell a thousand times. Well, after we did that and he didn't answer the door, then we remembered that he was at his friends house and all of that was a big waste of time. So we waited around, and finally he came outside and we saw his garage (they're building a gameroom! its so cool) and then somehow somebody started this big water fight and everyone was SOAKED and then we went to go ask if we could go to the park. So we asked Kinzie if he wanted to come and he said yes.&nbsp;(this was&nbsp;the first time he ever&nbsp;came with&nbsp;us) and when we got there we parked our bikes and then we played tag! (he he i think all the little kids were scared of us) then that got boring and we just went around and talked and played basketball and stuff like that. Aleesa got into this big fight with us&nbsp; because she wanted to go home (she thought we were going to be late) and Alysa and I told her she needed to loosen up and she said that we always hang out with Kinzie and she really does not like him AT ALL, and basically everybody was just annoyed with everyone else. So we headed home, and when we got there somehow Kinzie and Alysa and I just started talking (I dont know where Aleesa went) and we got into this big discussion and we told eachother EVERYTHING. I mean, EVERYTHING. Even about how much I liked him. And it was just fun talking and realizing we had no secrets. It was fun just being his friend for once, being open and honest and not worrying about wanting to go out with him again. I realized even if I am still not over that whole relationship thing that I still don't have to be heartbroken because I still hang out with him. Especially now, like I can just say&nbsp;anything to him and that feels good. We even talk about when we&nbsp;were goin out without&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;uncomfortable. (okay, maybe somebody is feelin it a lil bit but nobody shows it).&nbsp;and then he really wanted to play truth or dare (i dont know&nbsp;where that came from,&nbsp;but we decided that sense we were acting like little&nbsp;kids by going to the park why dont we just&nbsp;play the games we did 'back then' and we decided to play it.) It was hilarious. We only had a few minutes tho, because Alysa had to go inside and I did too. It was like nine o'clock when&nbsp;Alysa dared Kinzie to hold my hand for the&nbsp;rest of the game. Boy did I just about KISS her for daring him that!&nbsp;I REALLY REALLY REALLY WANTED THAT!!!! Even if it wouldnt have meant anything cuz it was just a dare. But guess what? Her dad came outside and said it was time for her to come inside right that very second!! So we never got to do that. Plus, like my parents were watching out the window. lol.&nbsp;But tomorrow, we're going to the park again and then he wants us to go see his room (i really dont know why :-/) but i guess we are going to.&nbsp;And we&nbsp;are going to finish up the&nbsp;game then.&nbsp;I wonder if that's going to happen. </FONT></P>

I don't even feel like typing it all. But let's see here where do I begin...

it started off as a normal day. I just hung out with Alysa and Kinzie and everything was fun accept Kinzie's stupid cat attacked the dove nest that was in our tree and I was really mad about that because the birdies were so cute, but anyway, then all of the sudden David G. shows up and he asked me if I liked Nick. Well, turns out he had just gotten back from Nick's house and Nick had just called him on his cell phone right then and David told him that I said I liked him. They were all laughing at me and I felt really stupid. Well then later on David was being a jerk. (whats new) saying stupid things and telling me I'm ugly and that Nick makes fun of me about how I like him so much and who would ever like me. I really couldn't take it. I'm having to deal with PMS, a guy who broke up with me who I still like, and parents who are going through a seperation and I'm all vulnrable and there's this guy telling me all this crap about all of my flaws AND telling me that my crush was saying it all. I know I shouldn't believe David, but what could I do? I didn't want to believe it, but if it was true I wanted to find out. So I told Jeneah all about it and we decided to egg Nick and David's houses on Thursday cuz they were bein jerks. So she goes and tells Nick off about how she's gonna go kick his ass. He's like, ""What did I do? What did I do? Please tell emily to talk to me!"" He sounded really really pathetic so Jeneah was like ""talk to him talk to him!"" so I did and this is part of our conversation on MSN:

NICK: emily wut did  i do
NICK: emily u their
NICK: plz talk
emily: hello
NICK: hey wuts up
NICK: about everything
emily: gosh people are making drama out of nothing
NICK: ok so wut is it
emily: um yea so I got a visitor today
emily:David
NICK: yea david
NICK: so wut happend
emily: well I don't know what to say
NICK: just say it
emily: okay, well he just said a lot of stupid things and some of them were what you said
emily: so I was just mad that the joke's always on me and that u guys would talk behind my back instead of telling me that you hated me or something
emily: cuz i can take that i just cant take it when I dont know whats going on
NICK: well wut did he say i said about u
emily: he said that you said that I was a goody goody or something and that you hated how obnoxious I was
NICK: wut omg thats so a lie im dead serious
NICK: i never said u were a goody goody and abnoxious
NICK: when he came over i said that u look way different and hotter
NICK says: thats wut i said i swear

so then I was like in shock or something. I felt really really bad and I didn't know what to do! Oh gosh. Well everythings better between me and Nick and asked for my cell # and he gave me his! So now I'm sort of happy. I mean, we're still gonna egg David's house cuz this is all his fault and he was still being a perv and talking about my boobs to Kinzie and making it sound like Kinzie was saying the gross stuff and I dont know maybe he was. Kinzie was tellin me how he didnt say anything and it was all David's fault and it could be, I wouldnt be surprised. I was mad at Kinzie, but I didnt freak out and bring it to his attention like I did with Nick. Cuz I really don't care. David is a pervert. I've known that since sixth grade when he grabbed a girl's butt until today when he was talking about <i>my</i> butt and other gross things. I hate guys. Kinzie didn't even try to stick up for me when David wouldn't stop saying all that stuff. He just laughed right along even tho afterwards he gave this big speech about how he hated David cuz he was so gross. You're still not off the hook, Kinzie, but maybe he doesn't care. I don't really even care anymore. A guy told me I was hot and gave me his number (even tho he probably does it to all the girls in that grade) I still don't care. But I am definately sick of all this useless petty drama in my life that I could do without."

"event","YAY! HIP HIP HOORRRAAYYYY!! Today is a beautiful and wonderful day! EVERY DAY IS BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL!!! I LUV MY FRIENDS!!! I CANT SAY IT ENOUGH! I LUV MY FRIENDS I LUV MY FRIENDS I LUV MY FRIENDS!!!!!!!!! Today Nick came by and he played basketball with Aleesa and me. We didnt get very far into the game because our parents were like ""Who's hoop is that! Don't play on someone's hoop you dont even know!!!"" So the score was like 6-6!! lol. But it was still fun. He went home but we might go to the park tomorrow and I'll ask if he can come cuz we can play basketball there. HE IS SOOOOO CUTE! And Kinzie has a really hot bod! I'm sorry but he DOES!!!! I dont think I like him anymore I just think he's hot! Whatever it changes every day so don't even try to follow it. I don't even care!! ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THAT LIFE IS WONDERFUL AND I AM SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL GUYZ AND GREAT FRIENDS! FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE! I've never been this happy. Gosh I used to be so depressed. The only thing I have to be depressed about now is that Dad might be moving out. :-o. Yea I was really shocked. I dont know where he's going to stay, and I dont know when he's leaving, but he is. Sometimes I am happy about this but mostly I just cry a lot about it. :-( so I'll just talk to my friends about it and look at some more beautiful guys and life will be wonderful again. I hope so."

No more drama in my life. 4:30pm I go outside and hang with my gurls until 7:00pm when we all go eat dinner then the next day it starts all over again. It's like we have no lives at school.

One: I am surrounded by cute guys, Two: I am surrounded by awesome friends, Three: I am surrounded my babysitting clients. What could be better? I didn't see Kinzie today. I am not even sure of my feelings anymore. GOSH! I am not even going to try to figure it out. I don't know how I feel about him. So I won't even dwell on it. Best be goin...I'm gonna lift weights with Dad then maybe go on a bikeride. LUV YA! ;-) ****</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT size=2>I have a more I need to rant about. Have you guessed it? Yep. You're right. The only thing that is on my mind 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I can't stop thinking about last night when we had so much fun hanging out, and how I never wanted the moment to end. I just wanted to be there <I>forever</I> just staring into his eyes and feeling his presence. Why do I like him so much? I thought I was over him. I remember writing, ""I'm so over him."" Just what <I>happend </I>??? I thought I started liking Nick. What happend to all these guys I thought were so much better than Kensie? Were they ever really better then him? Was I just trying to get over him faster? To tell you the absolute positive truth, I don't really like any of them. All of these guys who I have had crushes on at some point in time, well, I thought I still liked them, but now it just seems so gross and weird to talk about liking any other guy but Kensie. I thought I didn't miss him, but I missed having a boyfriend. But you know what? I don't WANT any other boyfriend, I want KENSIE as my boyfriend! I do I do I do I do I do I do I DO! I don't care what his stupid parent's say about having a girlfriend. Love will find a way, right? Yeah, sure, whatever. It's not that he even likes me back. But maybe he DOES! It would be so much easier if I knew for sure what he really thinks about me so I could stop over-analyzing things so much. I wish somebody knew the answers. Now I know nobody really knows what is going on inside his heart but him. And I don't know what to do about that. It's not like I can just come right out and ask him. Maybe I could ask him to get back together with me. That just made my stomach do a big flip-flop. No. No. No. No. Absolutely not. That is so off-limits, Emily. I cannot do that. But what if I did? Maybe I need to do something. Talk to somebody. I just can't think of what to do. All I know is that I miss him like crazy. I have to tell him because I can't go on like this and pretend that I don't care. I can never forget the night when we broke up and he wanted to pretend like that kiss never happend. I still don't know why he wanted to forget. Because I still remember pretty damn well. He can't act like that didn't happen. It did. And I want it to happen again. Sometimes I wonder if it ever will. I just gotta see his face again. I just got to got to got to be near him again. I just need him so bad.</FONT> </P>
<P>Arrachnopobia. Or however you spell it. That's what I have. It drives me crazy sometimes and I just can't stand it. I see a stupid little spider and I start freaking out. It's not really the spider that scares me, but I have this crazy wild imagination and I start seeing all these images and feeling like there's a billion little squirmy spiders crawling all over me. *shudders* Then it doesn't help when our house was like built on the spider capitol of the world. We have soooo many house spiders, wolf spiders, jumping spiders, and celler spiders. House spiders are pretty freaky. They actually live in your house and they won't survive outside. They are like reddish in color and they have medium long legs and they scurry really fast. I don't like them because they blend in with the carpet and you always see them when you least expet it, scurrying across the floor while you're lying there, not stopping for anything in their way. (Including a human body!) That is so creepy. Who wants a scary spider crawling all over them? Not me. Then, wolf spiders are the SCARIEST. They are huge and hairy and black and they scare me so bad. I can definately not squash those because they are so big. They make a popping sound when you squish them. EEW! Jumping spiders are the kind that we hardly find in the house, but they are outside a lot. They scare me because they are so unpredictable. You go to step on them and they start jumping all over the place and they might accidenetally land on your head or something. Celler spiders are the kind that everybody calls daddy long legs, but daddy long legs are <I>really</I> Harvestmen spiders that we don't have in California. But they look like celler spiders so we call celler spiders the nickname for harvestment spiders: daddy long legs. These do not scare me AT ALL. In fact, I like these kind because you always see them with a web in the corner, minding their own business, just waiting to catch all sorts of bad bugs for us. They are gray in color, and I dont think they even have eyes. Their bodys are like the size of the point on a ball point pen. The only reason they are big are because their legs are really long. They actually look sort of funny when they walk around with their huge legs and teeny bodies. Unfortunately, at our new house we barely have any of them. But guess what? We have plenty of wolf spiders!!! Yay. Anyway, the joys that come with having arrachnophobia are these: When I see a spider in a picture, in person, or even sometimes just think about one, I get all squirmy and I get goosebumps. My bloodpressure increases and I get nauseated. I've woken my dad up at 3am before just so he could kill a spider. I've had nightmares about spiders before and when I woke up, I jumped right out of bed and ran into the living room to sleep on the couch. It was pretty stupid, seeing as there are more spiders in the living room then my bedroom. Whatever. Sometimes I can get pretty crazy when I am having an ""eppisode"".</FONT></P>"

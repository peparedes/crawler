Anyways, here are some of the results:

That is the title track of his album



<lj-embed id=""2""/>
This one goes REALLY high... I like the second verse best.  At the end of it, there's a screen shot showing the back of the album and you can see the list of tracks that he sings on it.


The lady playing the piano is John's singing teacher... her son is a composer and tenor and general musician and you can listen to him singing his biggest work here:

Don't forget, however awful life ever gets and however much suffering happens to you and around you, you can rejoice because at the end, you can be happy with Him in Heaven for all eternity, just because He loved us to death.

That century from Gilchrist wasn't at all boring though.  I've decided that he's the hero of the XI at the moment, not because he hits amazing sixes, but because he's a Very Good Sport and a Fine Role Model.

One of the things that greatly annoyed me when I switched computers at the beginning of the year is that when I transferred my music collection, the ratings I had so carefully chosen for each song didn't come too. *big bottom lip pout*  This means I can't just click on the ""Play-all-5-star-songs-playlist"".

And how does this count as a proper Journal entry?  Because it shows you just what is going on in my little corner of the world: I'm distracting myself from my assignments.

"event","Just a bit less than a year ago, I had the great fortune to meet, only for a few minutes, a personage by the name of Danielle.  Since she was the cousin of my friends, I had actually popped across and read her LiveJournal several times before this.  It was so interesting and inspiring and unwhingy that I really wanted to friend her. Of course, I was too shy to leave a comment on the LJ of someone I didn't know in real life!  But naturally, in the few minutes that we chatted, we agreed to friend each other.  And so we did, and reading Danielle's LiveJournal has been a reg'lar habit of mine ever since.  And, you know, I am very, very thankful to have such a Wise And Entertaining Person on my friends list.  Because, you see, she wears many hats.  She's a Philosopher, Poet, Good-Example-Setter, Author of Sketches Both Graphic and Verbal, Leaver Of Comments Cheeky Or Encouraging As Appropriate, Photographer, and of course, Proclaimer of God's Love.

I've typed this out because I think people often don't get a chance to know what Important Friends they are.  And I'm really proud to count Danielle as an Important Friend, even though we have actually only known each other for a very short time.  What better time to tell her than on her birthday? So <strong>Big Enormous Birthday Greetings and Blessings to <lj user=""dagoochy""></strong>, and I hope that every one of her dreams, both big and little, will be fulfilled in the Lord's special way in the coming year.

Thank you, Danielle, and Happy 26th Birthday!"

I didn't really find an answer [apart from the fact that a) I have nothing to say and b) I have no time in which to say this nothing] but the result has been that I have sat down to post several times.

I have just finished bagging meat for Mum. She has a very clever system in which the different types of meat are divided into meal sized bags and given labels with the date and type of meat before going in the freezer... because, as everyone knows, it is very hard to work out whether that lump of ice will emerge as a steak or a sausage when it is defrosted.

Waltz_matilda, I'm very sorry we didn't make it to the concert tonight ;(  Next time! Let us know when the next one is...

Well, that's about it I guess.  I feel like I should repeat my deepest apologies for two things:  1.  lack of commenting.  I HAVE read all our posts, but I'm flat out working and living so I have commented not wisely or too well.  2. trip stuff.  photos coming, I promise.  also day-by-day accounts (after we've finished going through the day-by-day accounts with the rest of our family here!!)

"event","An absolutely fantastic quote came in on my daily RSS internet feed from quotation.com the other day:

""I've got a vendetta to destroy the Net, to make everyone go to the library. I love the organic thing of pen and paper, ink on canvas. I love going down to the library, the feel and smell of books.""
-Joseph Fiennes

<i>Wow, how wonderful, thought I.  It's so true!  This internet is soaking up my brain, and destroying the real pleasures of life, and reading, and research. I wonder who this Joseph Fiennes is anyway?</i>

So I loaded up Google and typed him in, and found out all about him and what he looks like and other interesting things he has had to say.

And then I made a resolution that I would put his vendetta into practice.  This useless internet would nevermore hold me in thrall!  I was never going to use it again.  The real, tactile, crinkly page world was where I belonged, and whence I would now return.

And then I thought about how, without the internet and feed readers and Google, I would never have realised that I should get rid of my internet and feed readers and Google.  This puzzled me a bit, so i need to ask you a question.  Which of the following is true?

1.  The internet is self-destructing by allowing quotations such as this to float around in the ether.

2.  The quotation is self-destructing because it isn't published in a book or library - you can only find it by floating around the internet-ether.


And totally irrelevantly:  the word 'quote' gives me the horrors.  It <i>would</i> creep into my thesis last year, continuously, driving my pore supervisor crazy because he thought it was <i>my</i> fault that I couldn't say 'quotation'.  And now I picture the word 'quote' as a silly little teenage girl talking to fast about a thesis that is too  simple and unsophisticated for words, and I see 'quotation' as a tall, old man, balding with grey hair. ;)"

<lj-cut>Here is the bay of Naples.  We were driving around from Sorrento to Pompeii.
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/lizzie_balans/pic/00005zdz/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/lizzie_balans/pic/00005zdz/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>


Here is the photo with handy marks explaining certain pixels.  The big red circle is our boat, the Seabourn Spirit. Our cabin marked with an X.  The little circle is the tender which drove us into  the wharf and back.  Middle right arrow points off to the Isle of Capri.  Left double arrow points to yukky rocky beach.  Lower right arrow with curly tail points to Pompeii and Mt Vesuvius.

The next item is something which I would prefer not to post.  I am posting it under suffrance.  It was filmed to entertain my dear little brothers and sisters, who like that song.  It's a song about the port we are at.  The song is called Torna Sorrento - Return to Sorrento.  I feel like the white knight in Alice through the Lookingglass.  It's 2MB, so I 'spect you won't be able to look at it...

Oh yay it's not uploading... I'll come back and have another go sometime else...

We'll try and get some photos with-people-and-fascinating-places-in-them uploaded ASAP. :D</lj-cut>

Ooh, and maybe, just maybe, we might be able to go to a concert on Saturday evening. Maybe.  I hope. Waltz-matilda, do you know which concert?  :D  Yes, that one!"

And then I found fifty dollars. <br /><br />My <strong>assignment is finished</strong>. You didn't even know I'd started it, did you, because I haven't posted in years! <br /><br />I had to <strong>stay home</strong> in bed today. <br /><br />Life is pretty <strong>busy</strong> at the moment. I thank the Lord that I <strong>do not have any exams</strong> this semester. <br /><br /><span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />dizzy_liz</span> is sweet.

And it is nice to know that Catholics 2000 years ago believed exactly what I believe today, right down to minute details. <br /><br />This is an exciting and enlightening post, no? <strong>Ask me a question</strong> so that I have something to talk about. Any question. A random question. <br /><br /><strong>Teaching is good</strong>, but stressful. I've learned so much. It gives me lots of food for thought, the chief thought being that I will definitely homeschool any children God gives me, DV. <br /><br />Reader Participation: <strong>Would you like to travel to Europe</strong>? How much? Why? Where? <br /><br />:( I'm feeling ill again. <strong>Adieu</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>PS</strong> How could I forget?&nbsp; Australia scored their first goal in a World Cup ever.&nbsp; I really think they are most likely to win now. :P&nbsp; I'm not serious.&nbsp; It will be England or Germany who wins.&nbsp; I hope England, but I think Germany.</p>"

This one isn't a commentary, just a quotation.

<b><i>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John 6,52-59.

The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, ""How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?"" Jesus said to them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever.""</i></b>"

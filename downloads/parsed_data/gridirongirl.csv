do you remember when you were a kid and... i don't. most kid memories i have supressed because of my rough childhood. so, now, here i am a nanny of three of the most beautiful, genuinely happy children on the planet at christmas time. they have been jogging my memory...i remember the long wait-2 days!!! are you kidding? that is forever!!!...i remember the presents-stacking them up like legos and tempting myself beyond reason...i remember that my mom always made butterscotch birdsnest, and they were lovely...i remember my mom always read us luke 2, and i always felt so sorry for mary...i remember the joy my mother used to get when we opened something we really wanted...i REALIZE her effort to give us the world because my father sucks. now that i'm married and a 1/2 mom i can't believe my mother is still alive. i am so thankful for my mother. all my memories seem to surround her. she is the light in my dark past..."

"event","so, i'm minding my own business standing in line forever (okay, only 1 1/2 hours) to vote. when a mans says, ""if you have moved out of this poll area in the last thirty days or more, you might be standing in the wrong line."" ""that can't be me,"" i insist in my head. ""i went to the website to find out where to go, and i know that after standing in the rain for an hour and a half with a three year old they will let me vote here."" yeah, i was wrong...bastards! they send me to another place. no problem. i am zealous about the united states government. i think voting is important. i have voted in almost every election i could (even the ones that are small) because i believe that democracy requires response. so, i go and wait in line for another 30 minutes with a three year old praying they will hurry because i have to get my 5 year old in an hour. wait...wait...wait...i'm not discouraged. on the contrary i'm encouraged by the big turn out. wait...wait...wait..by the time i get to the table its 20 minutes, and those big bastards proceed to tell me that i can't vote there on the machine, but i can vote, but it might not be counted and that i should just fill out all this shit ton of information and they will get to me as soon as they can.......*now punching keys as hard as i can*...BIGGER BASTARDS!!! needless to say i did not vote. i went and picked up my 5 year old. i did however steal a ""i voted."" sticker on the way out because i was so mad...yeah, i sure showed them!!! bastards!

and that is why i was angry yesterday..."

Frankly, the way most other Democrats behave embarasses you greatly.

You pride yourself on a high level of morals, and you have a good grasp on right and wrong.

It's likely you think America needs to get back to its conservative, Juedo-Christian values.

Why aren't you a Republican then? Because you believe the goverment helps more than hurts.

"event","when you encounter something that blesses you...no, start over. when i encounter something that blesses me...i begin to think of all the things that happened to make that blessing come my way. this weekend i got to enjoy my in laws beach house (my inheritance, as they call it). it is a 5 bedroom 3 bath immaculately decorated ocean front refuge, for which i am very grateful. we went down for a youth retreat with the leaders from our church. anyway, on the way down there i started thinking out loud with mt about all the things that had to happen for us to be going there this weekend. just to name a few...his parents stayed married (after much trouble early on), they were faithful and deliberate about money (knowing it comes from God), they enjoy and share the gifts that God has given them (1 timothy 6 at the end of the chapter somewhere). it has just occured to me how amazing that all is. years ago, when they decided to remain faithful to their covenant to each other before God, they had no idea that in october of 2004, sixteen people would be richly blessed because of their faithfulness in that one decision. holy crap that is huge to me!!! it has made me very reflective and aware that my choices are significant. all of my choices are significant. i want to live my life making wise choices because i have been so blessed by this weekend. the relentless pursuit of God is at the moment not annoying, but a masterpiece instead."

"event","i'm not a people person. i mean, i am and i'm not. anytime mt sets something up for us to go out with other people, i'm like ""yeah, i think i'm sick."" its terrible. i know that is not who i was created to be, but at the same time, i have no desire to be close to too many people. mt always says i don't like people, and he's right (even though i'll deny it to his face...why does he get to know me so well??? that is so annoying sometimes, but that is another journal.) why are we constantly trying to figure everything out about people on the first meeting? why can't i just love that girls addictive smile and want to be around her. or like to look at his inviting eyes, and just want to be around them? anyway, i've had the hardest time letting people in for the last couple of years. i lived with this girl once that wanted to analyze me all the time. maybe it was because she had nothing else to do, or no life of her own. i certainly had an eventful life according to her. anyway, whatever the reason for her constant questioning and opinion forming...i hated her. i felt like a subject. i think that's why. i mean, seriously. if you think about your choices being picked apart all the time...uhhh! it makes you feel like a case study. i don't want relationships because i don't want to not measure up to someone else's standards. i mean, fuck them! who are they anyway. i met this lady the other day that asked me what happened to me as a child after i commented on how much i don't like the out doors (especially bees). i was like fuck your crazy ass! i don't need you to tell me what i already know! i have spent lots of time and money figuring me out...why don't you look in the mirror instead of at me? now, if you think i was overreacting, well, you're probably right. anyway, question for the day...why can't we all just get along? why can't we all just take one another in like a glass of fine wine? one sip at a time..."

""no my dear.

quick stop in the bathroom to pee
then, i run to the door and who do i see
trisket876 smiling at me.
deep breath in, ""who could it be.""
""its t.
is this a bad time for thee?""
hold on please. i'll be right back.
if i open the door now, you'll see my crack!
five minutes later as dressed as could be
i open the door and exclaim, ""t!""
""did i catch you in the middle of something?
am i making a scene?""
""why, i'm so shocked at these comments!
whatever do you mean?""
okay, enough of the rhymes. yeah, i got caught last night. yeah, i was with my husband, but i got caught. how embarrassing!!! i have never been caught before. so, there."

"event","and doesn't it just blow your mind to think that someone is thinking of you. i mean, i always feel so insignificant and small...why would anyone be thinking of me? besides mt of course, but he has to. God has fried me on his brain, poor guy. really though. and when you think of someone, do you tell them. of course not. that would put you way out of your damn box. of course i'm typing you and meaning me! get off my back! i'm having an epiphany. did i just make that word up? anyway, i e-mail this girl the other day that i secretly love in the most nonsexual way. i don't know her that well, and all i wrote was, ""i was just thinking of you and wanted to say hey. that's it."" yeah, brilliant. you cannot imagine how profusely i started sweating!!! that is so stupid! why do we do that? why are we so afraid?"

""only"" is not the best word there. if fact the word ""only"" is not even needed. so, there. just forget i said it. or typed it. no, i'm not going to delete it. its too valuable to this journal entry. i mean, look at it. if it weren't there and i weren't going on apologizing about ever saying it (or typing as is the case), we wouldn't be here at the end of my first entry."

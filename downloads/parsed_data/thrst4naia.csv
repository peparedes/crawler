I LOVE my new job! well, love it in the I have a headache/ heart attack every day in the off-set chance that SOME important script going to Brad Pitt didn't make it on time or somehow we misspelled Tobey Maguires name in some letter type way-- but it really is great. There's this awesoem feeling knowing that I'm on the right path-- one of the BEST desks I could be on-- and that my boss really seems to appriciate me. We rep the Kadakawa library (TOMIE, etc) and I had given someone at Red Wagon the manga novel back before I left. Now that I'm on Jon's desk, I've been actively involved in trying to bring them together- it's a REALLY cool feeling. Whether or not it becomes a deal is so far fetched-but just knowing that Jon believes in my taste, values my opinion is GREAT. And I can't explain it-- being at CAA, just makes sense. Oh yes, life rocks. I'm just sooooo grateful that I know what I want to do in life- and am making it happen. Rock."

"event","Oh yeah- forgot. This weekend, LA almost floated away. This weekend, my ego about sank. On Friday, Linds and I went out with Kane and his friend Nick. New Years weekend the Kane-Naia-Lindsay deadlock ended as I passed out in a drunken mess and he and Lindsay hooked up. Ok, so the crush thing with Kane- now it really has to stop, I know, I get it. And its really NOT that big a deal- Lindsay has hooked up with him before, they have a history, makes sense. Ok, fine. But its still crappy, when at the end of the night, you're the one sleeping alone. 
Saturday, we went out with Emma, a friend of mine from Red Wagon, to Le Dome. Very cool, very Euro place. Saw Nick Stahl looking all heroin chic and Jamie Foxx (he DEFINITELY checked me out!). We were with a bunch of Emma's British and Aussie friends, all guys, all pretty cute. Two of them definitely were interested in Lindsay. Not a one really seemed to notice me at all. I hate to say it, but this is a new thing for me. I'm used to guys being interested in me, used to not have to think about it. Now, out here, I'm just another face- it blows, I gotta admit. At this point, I'm comfortable with myself- this is me, nothing is going to change. My personality is what it is, my body is what it is, my face is what it is and if someone doesn't like that, too f-in bad. But BECAUSE I can't change it, it's frustrating if no one is interested in what's not getting changed!!! Feel free to throw me a pity party. Or send me a cute boys pls."

"event","So the last few weeks of work have been super busy. Emily, Red Wagon's new executive vice president, came in and I started as her temporary assistant. It's funny how things work out- if I had gotten Bobby's desk, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to work and learn from Emily. She's AMAZING- exactly where and who I want to be in terms of the business, ten years from now. Working with her has opened my eyes to SO much- and it was only three weeks before I scored a REAL job- the first step to my career. I'm going to be one of Jon Levin, an agent at CAA's assistants. To anyone outside of the business, that probably does sound like much- but trust me, it's BIG. If the Hollywood agencies were compared to colleges, CAA would be Harvard (I hate having to say that, but we're talking perception here). Jon Levin, one of CAA's biggest literary agents, has clients like Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg and Robin Williams, along with some of the biggest screen writers in the world. He's a tough guy- I'm prepared to be screamed at, humiliated, broken down- but in the end, it'll be worth it when a year from now I can get any assistant position I want. From there, it's on to junior exec, exec... producer! And then I'll rule the world. Or atleast the box office. It's funny how it all seemed so big and scary and then suddenly clicks- I get it now- how it works out here. 
Monday's my last day at RWE- sooo sad! I'm really going to miss it there- but it's time to move on. Get started. Eye of the tiger and all that...."

"event","Joy! I'm temping! Finally making some money! And been going on many interviews, hopefully one (or the temping for our new VP) will turn into a job. (Please god, please)...
In other news, I met a boy. Not the love of my life type boy, but a nice guy to hang out with occasionally. He's 20, a baby, which is v. weird. But he's adorable in this golly-gosh gee, you're interested in me? way. I feel like Mrs. Robinson.
Last night I went out to dinner with my boss from Royce and some of the other teachers. We went to a strange, kitchsy Korean restaraunt where they fried everything. Dr. Chang (boss) is a very funny little Asian woman who must be snorting lines of coke when we aren't looking, cause she is the most wired little thing ever. She asked us, seriously, if she should order two bottles of whisky for the table. When we said, no PLEASE, she ordered seven 40's of Korean beer, a liter Korean vodka flavored with lemon and sake. Then proceeded to drink the vodka straight out of the bottle it was served in. Awesome. The teachers talked about hot students, which disturbed me and I spent the time making googly eyes at my hot boss, Ken, who's 30 and has a serious girlfriend. From 20-30, my taste is getting a little arbitrary. 
The highlight of the meal was when Zack (another teacher) asked me if I would like some of his ""Hot steamy neather organs"" which really was on the menu.
Good times, good times."

"event","I haven't written in forever, I suck, I know. But to be fair, it wasn't for lack of trying. Right after the world disaster that was the election, I wrote a heartfelt, disapointed, meaningful entry on my feelings about moral issue voters, the red states, the next four years and what I'm going to do to help change things. But the stupid livejournal wasn't working right and erased the whole damn thing. So now you're getting a much less serious, much more vapid entry. DEAL WITH IT. Life has been pretty busy. I've licked my wounds over this whole job thing and have chalked it up to experience. I needed to fail at getting something I wanted purely because it's never happened before. I think it showed the higher ups that I have more class and dignity that I didn't flip my shit or run away after, but honestly, I'm moving on now. I've been interviewing with some independent production companies and the agencies and my feedback on the interviews have all been pretty awesome. I've actually managed to meet two women who I think will serve as great mentors (though neither of them probably my boss) and from getting good feedback from all the people I think my badly hurt ego has slightly been rehibilitated. So that's good. What's not good is that I am now faced with a choice between settling with a job that isn't perfect for me now or waiting til January when things will open up. I hate, hate being a burden on my parents for yet another month, but it seems like the wisest choice. The job in question is assistant to this reality tv agent at William Morris. I walked into her office and she was knitting. IN THE DARK. So that should have been my first sign. But then she told me that she doesn't know how to use a computer and doesn't read. AND SHE WAS PROUD OF THAT. But whatever, we had a good connection, she seemed ok. The minute I stepped out of the office, I was attacked by everyone I knew at WMA (Frank, Michelle, etc) and a couple people I didn't who were telling me she was basically the anti-christ. So I may want to rethink that one. 

On the social level, since Linds got out here things have been so much better. I never realized how hard it was to not have close girlfriends with you. I've always just taken it for granted but the time when Leah was super busy and I was here all alone was HARD. But now we are back to our usual hijinks and I'm so happy. I'm also starting to make more new friends as Melissa introduces me to ppl she knows. I went to dinner with her and two girls from WMA, who are really awesome. The funniest part is that Mel barely knew them, she bonded with them over some common client and they made plans. One of them has this boyfriend who I literally stared at the whole dinner trying to place him. Turns out he's some actor who was in Not Another Teen Movie and Detroit Rock City. I don't remember him from either of those, so it's still driving me crazy. Boy stuff is still kinda bizarre, I'm not talking to my random ass boy anymore since well, he was random ass and once he got less random I realized he's a bit of a real ass. Frank and I are staying pretty platonic which I actually kinda like, it's good just being friends especially when he's yet again on tv and I don't have to obsess over it like last time and he's helped me out a lot out here. There is a seriously cute coffee boy who is now the Red Wagon obession, down to Doug and Lucy's 13 year old daughter, Tessa (great, I have the same taste as an 8th grader, awesome). I've been casually flirting but won't be there much longer so I need to step it up. So nothing all that tangible here. Of course though, cause nothing can ever be easy in my dating life, my long distance things are going great. Aleks comes back in December from Spain (he is this guy I met on my summer cruise, met up with in Prague and generally did the whole European romance even though he's from New Hampshire) and Eric (25, NYC born and bred type guy I met at Marquee and dated briefly while in NYC) just invited me to go to his uncle's place in March. The place is in AFRICA and his uncle is the AMBASSADOR. Right. Two things scare me about both these ""things"" (I just can't say relationships, I just can't): 1. They are both register Republicans, as was random ass boy. WHY AM I ATTRACTED TO THESE PEOPLE AND WHY ARE THEY ATTRACTED TO ME? Arg. 2. Both of these guys, at one point or another made me question, what if I had stayed on the East Coast? I know that if I had moved to New York, Eric and I would have continued dating and would probably be a couple right now, our dynamic was just really awesome. So I'm scared that if I do go and things remain the way they are out here, just nothing great coming along, it's going to be so hard to not get more attached. I'm making a bigger deal out of this than is probably needed but it is Africa. And I am a teeny bit in need of some kind of relationship that does not involve drunken hookups on dance floors (don't get me started...). Eric is a grown-up. And by him being interested in me, does that make me one too? I don't think I'm ready for that, honestly. It's friggin scary, I'm really growing up... 
On that note I think I need to go watch cartoons.
But just to satisfy the Dennis Kwan-ians out there, here's my updated celebrity sighting list:

A List:
Adam Sandler- His office is next to ours. I went in to submit my resume and ended up handing it to ADAM SANDLER.
Josh Dummal (he may be B list, depends on who you talk to). Came in to see Lucy, I got to walk him to audio/sound. Hott.
Oliver Stone, Colin Ferrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto- Screening for Alexander, me and linds just wandered in while waiting to see Bridget Jones. Best night at the movies EVER. 
Teresa Heinz Kerry, love her, so sad.
Rob Marshall at Geshia. Oh and I've spoken to Sam Mendes and Toby Maguire when they've called for Bobby.
B List:
Nicole Richie, Anna from the OC, Phil whatever from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, the senator from XMen, Red from That 70s Show, Guitarist from the Scorpions
C List: 
haha, FRANK, CT and Arissa. Anyone from reality tv basically lives here. But CT was funny cause I ran into him at Deep last night and since we hosted Singled Out together, it was kinda nice to see him. Frank apparently is in my life forever now whether I like it or not. Arissa works at the Saddle Ranch and Farshid was a great admirer of her body. Gotta admit, it's pretty damn good."

"event","Things are moving so fast out here I don't even know where to start. I guess the beginning works, right? So on Wednesday, I went out to Q's with Kathryn, Tara, Dennis, Farshid, Eugene and Meredith (D's old roommie). It was almost overwhelming to see so many of my friends from school...it felt sooooo good to just be with all of them, we could have just sat there and started at the wall, just to hear their voices and pretend I was back at school... anyway, so Q's, a bar right by Dennis' place. A bar where Meredith works. A bar where last summer Frank made me cry and swear i'd never talk to his dumb ass again.  So it was ONLY fitting that I would run into...guess who? FRANK. But it was actually the best possible situation: I was with friends, he was alone after a bad date. He's working as a floating assistant at William Morris; we traded notes for a bit and then he went into the...sooooo, let's hang out sometime (actually, I believe he said, ""hey gues what I won a temperpetic bed on the Challenge, you should come see my place."")Right. And I got to say, SORRY I'M BUSY THIS WEEKEND. MWUHAHAHAHA. 

But I'll probably call him next weekend. What can I say, I have a weakness for nerdy reality stars with cute butts.

Ok, SECOND: Stacey, my boss' first assistant got fired/quit yesterday. Not sure which. All I know is that it was sudden and I ended up taking over for her yesterday. I WANT HER JOB. I know I just started, I know there's a hiearchy, but comm'on, I know how to do her job, I've been doing it FOR her since September. So I'm going to talk to Bobby tonight. I truly, truly cannot stand the idea that if I don't get it, I'm going to have to go into the general intern pool. I DON'T want to do that. I feel like since I made the decision to come out here, fate has been really stepping it up for me. I truly hope that this is one of those cases.
I'll keep ya posted...."

"event","This has been such a high-low week. I came back from Providence and was just so down, missing school, missing knowing everyone, missing being an intergral part to a community....I just didn't know how to verbalize it; I'm not used to feeling lost, usually things just work out. So I was battling these feelings when I got in my first car accident in LA on Thursday. I was coming down Santa Monica, driving behind Dennis, about to merge into his lane when this crazy ass comes barreling down from a side street, forcing me to swerve into the other lane. I clipped a limo and dented my passenger side. Just my luck, I didn't even hit anyone GOOD. That was just the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. I FREAKED out. Made it all the way to Little Temple before I started to just bawl. Leah and Sandeep came to get me and I heaved big, snotty tears onto Leah's shoulder. Every little thing I had been feeling, every lonely night, uncertain thought, embarrassed moment came pouring out. Poor Dennis and Sandra backed away from the crazy girl and Leah and Sandeep drove home with me. I fell asleep in my clothes and woke up the next day 5 minutes after i was supposed to leave for work. Great.
But strangely, I felt great. Alright, so actually I felt tired, sick, congested and dirty, but great all the same. I think after college everyone needs a good freak out once in a while, it just helps to let it out. The real world is scary; its cold and mean and not like college where you know everyone and everyone loves you. But there is good to it. The accident showed me that I DO have ppl out here who care about me and from the million messages I had the next day, ppl back home too. 
So, I'm starting to feel a little better about myself. Then Emma (from work) invites me to Chris Ovitz's birthday party. Chris is my friend Kim's big brother and lives in a hot bachelor pad in Bel Air. Emma's exact words were, ""Chris told me to bring girls cause there will be too much d@%k there."" Best words EVER. Sadly, the d@%k there was vapid and had the attention span of well, a d@%k. It amazes me how fake ppl can be out here. Literally, I would be involved in conversation with someone to have them veer off mid sentence when Nicole Richie walked by or something (and might I say she's really damn short, how they actually saw her without a magnifying glass is pretty impressive). I head not one intelligent conversation until I was stranded at the house while my ride engaged in a threesome and left to talk to a guy named David who was actually pretty interesting. Of course he wasn't in the business, that explained a lot. 
I'm learning a lot out here, about how LA works: I know I can handle it, I knwo I can handle anything they throw at me. But if I EVER start acting like one of those ppl... good god, please, put me out of my misery. 
Ok, just for the guilty celeb watch, party goers included: various Abercrombie models, the gilmore girl chick, Sanmiria whats her name from the OC (who showed up with flowers, an In-Touch magazine and a happy 18th birthday card for Chris, randomly gave Emma a pair of earrings she made and then wrapped soem fur thing on me and vanished) and Nicole Richie.
Good times, good times."

Like when we first met in Cannes during the Film Festival (we were both in a program through the American Pavilion) and he told me we should date while there because ""I'm the most connected guy and you're the hottest girl. We'd make a great team."" Ew. Buuuuut, he's grown up and if I do say so myself, I'm really quite proud of lil Sammy. He's working on the Kerry campaign, fundraising on the West Coast. If (WHEN) Kerry wins, he'll pack up and move to DC to spread the Kerry love and his special smoozing talents to the masses. The fact that he's actually making a difference in the elections outcome amazes and inspires me. Maybe I'll try to set up a visit to my high school when I go back for Chrissy's wedding, try to speak to the Seniors about voting? Anyway, last night was one of his fundraisers, a benefit dinner with Teresa Heinz-Kerry as the keynote speaker. All the first assistants at my office were going and I was a biiit jealous. Enter Sam, who is running the whole damn thing, and just like that, Leah and I are on the guest list. It's good to have well connected friends, let me tell you. So after work (and completing my first two successful conference calls- go me!!!)I rush over and make it just in time to hear her speak. Wow. What a strong woman. Until a woman (go Hilary!) finally runs for office, one of the things I pick my candidates on is the capacity and intelligence of their first ladies. And let me tell you, Teresa kills the first Librarian by a landslide. Here's a self sufficent, educated, outspoken woman who isn't afraid to say and act exactly as she wishes standing next to- not behind- her candidate. That pretty much rules. What else ruled about the event- getting treated like I should be there (yeah, I paid $1,000 to be here, be nice to me!), Leah being in heaven over meeting Red from that 70s show and the senator from Xmen, the huge ass house that the benefit was held at in Beverly Park. Things that didn't rule- getting lost and missing out on the free food. But Sam took us to Swinger's after so i guess that didn't entirely not rule.

Other random musings: Why do I attract Republicans? Why am I continuously ATTRACTED to republicans? It may be their infinately nerdy nature and white boy charms but good lord, you'd think I'd make it easier on myself.

Teresa said that even the Crawford newspaper (that's W's ranch land ppl) is supporting Kerry. You know you fucked up pretty royally when a small, southern town that derives half its income from your visits doesn't even want you as President. Go Crawford!!"

"event","Today was a mixed emotions type o' day. I woke up late after a long night out that involved standing outside of Star Shoes where I spent a good half hour waiting for Sam-from-Cannes to show, going to some vaguely Asian-themed bar where I met a group of guys wearing fake gold eagles around their necks (apparently something like the Skulls of Yale except less Paul Walker, more GWB style. very dumb.) and then ending up at an illegal after-hours spot in Little Ethiopia where Sam's friend Z, the ""Mayor of Little Ethiopia"" received guest while we stood around looking shades of white and yellow. Interesting. Anyway, so after I haul my ass out of bed at 1:30, Leah, Ginger and I attend this weird sample sale in the Hollywood Hills. It was in someone's house, yet they had valet parking. Weird. Then we went to Cafe 101, a spot featured in Swingers, for a late lunch before Leah and I had to do less glamour things, like laundry and grocery shopping. On the way from the sample sale to the Cafe, I realized that this was now my life- an average Sunday in L.A. Strange how it creeps up on you like that, the realization that something that was relatively alien about two weeks ago is now your life. No more Sundays going to the Brickway or getting Oceans coffee before writing a paper. No more gossiping on Mere's bed after a night out at Max's or the GCB. No more starting a paper due the next morning at 1am. This is my life now. Very weird. And just when it couldn't get more unsettling- nothing like actually facing reality before you've even had coffee- Add (addie- one of my very best friends from home) called. Crying. Her grandma in Pennsylvania died today, of cancer. And here I am, 5,000 miles away, enjoying a ""hipster"" lunch after a designer sample sale, completely unable to help her and almost unable to hear her because of the traffic outside. Shit. I wish I could be there for her, losing a grandparent is so freakin hard. I wish I could just teleport back whenever I wanted, wish that almost everyone I loved and cared about weren't on the East Coast- this isn't my full life, never can be my full life with that as a truth. It sucks that I can't be there for Add, sucks that I can't really be there for a lot of people. True, at Brown I was 6 hours away from home-but by car. If I ever was needed or got really homesick, all I had to do was get in my car. Now I have to get on a plane. It makes missing people much harder."

"event","Yay, I've made some new girl friends! Not that Leah, Dennis et al aren't wonderful, but I've been dyyyying for girls to go out with, shop, etc, and since Leah has a boyfriend and Dennis is well, a boy, my wing-girl options have been limited. But thanks to Dennis, I think I have three built-in new girl friends: Ginger, Meredith and Courtney (I know, the names as a whole seem ditzy, but hey, I was almost named Syndy, so I'll cut 'em some slack :) ). Ginger went to Princeton, is Dennis' roommate/friend from Deerfield and works for Media 8. She's a hapa too. Meredith and Courtney both went to U of Arizona (um, I think?) and are blondes; Meredith is a tall, vivacious (love that word) curly haired dirty one who works at Cues and is an actress. Courtney is petite, southern and looks like a small version of Trishelle (but much more intelligent-she works for Fairchild publications). Ginger and I are going to a ""Girls Night of Shopping"" sponsored by a vodka, on Thursday. I'm assuming that means that they plan on getting rich trophy wives and studio exec daughters sloppy ass drunk and then show em ridiculously over priced left-over Manolos, but we have news for them: I plan on drink alll their cosmos and not buying a damn thing unless it's the price of an In-N-Out Burger. Mwu-hahaha...I'm becoming so cheap (especially after I got my first ticket today- for parking- I was literally next to the car with my keys out and the karma-doomed meter wench STILL gave me a ticket. She's coming back as a slug). In any case, I'm just happy to be finding fun people. Between hanging out with Dennis and Ginger today and Leah yesterday (we saw Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow- TERRIBLE dialog, but the graphics are groundbreaking), I realized how much you need familiar faces around after a long day of work. I think no more collapsing in a coma like state after work- the key to this whole post college thing is to keep busy and keep meeting people. Oh, speaking of meeting people- my new boss at my paying job, tutoring in KTown- is hott. Which is going to make SAT teaching muuuch much more fun.

Oh- and finally- I'm going back to school for Leadership Weekend!!! It's pretty sad but I am ridiculously excited to go back to college- Max's, Fish Co, The Avon, Antonio's, La Femme Boutique, GCB-aaand a ton of recent grads and senior friends. I hate to be one of those people (and I truly hope that it wasn't the apex to my life experience) but my college experience was the best of my life thus far. Dennis and I were talking about this the other day and realized that we are truly lucky to be able to say that- I learned so much, I met so many amazing people, I did so many things that I never thought I could; it shaped me. And obviously, from the amount I'm even discussing it in this journal, it's continuing to shape my life. I know there is much, much more in store and soon we will rule L.A. but right now, when things are so new and unsettled, its hard not to get wistful and reminisce about ""the good ole days"". I'm turning into a father cliche. Ouch."

The phone is ringing off the hook, I've dropped three calls, one of which is Shirley Maclaine's agent, I can't get Stacey's attention cause she's frantically trying to make travel arrangements for Doug Wick to get to Yale, not on Red-Eye, not too long a layover BUT he has to make a 10am speaking app't yet can't leave L.A. before 6PM (NOT her job by the way) and I haven't eaten or peed in seven hours. Finally, Stacey makes the arrangements for a connection from JFK to Hartford, hangs up. Phone rings, our boss Bobby. ""So Stacey, I just talked to Doug and he's going to drive from JFK to New Haven, book him a car and hotel there ok? Bye."" 
Here we go again.
Actually, its not all that bad, that was just the crazy part. The good parts: I'm Red Wagon Entertainment President Bobby Cohen's second assistant, have my own desk(!!), computer(!!!) and maybe, one day, if the tech guy gets to it, internet and a email account (how did we live without internet? I have a vague memory of those dark ages but they are pretty repressed). Also good: everyone is very nice, Stacey is patient and cool, the interns are fun, the staff is silly and Bobby even asked me how I was doing today!! He TALKED to me (I wonder if Doug or Lucy will ever do the same). More good: I get to listen in on all of Bobby's calls, find out all the good gossip, see all the dailys, hear about Jake Gyllanhaal's nude scene (!). And on my first day, it was an assistants birthday and we got cake and moet (she got a digital camera from sony-dammit, why isn't my birthday in September??). OOOOO-Aaaand-I picked up a guy while waiting in line for my photo ID. Not bad for my first day.
The bad?: I HATE screwing up. And I've managed not to do it too much, but the damn phone- I'm a freaking college graduate!! A simple conference phone is making me its bitch! GRRRRRR...also, sooooo freakin tired, I can barely collapse into my car at 7:30 and then sit in traffic for god knows how long. And it's only DAY TWO.

PS: I'm uncut.

I'd give up my vote for one night with you.

Hate to break it to you darling...the world hated the US before Bush entered office.....or do you think people bomb and terrorize people they like?  My wife and daughter have the same rights you do ...to keep there legs together, to use birth control or to live with the results of their decision.  To make a arbitray decision that life begins on day 90 or 120 or day 12 is a convient way to skate on guilt.  If a woman becomes pregnant through consensual sex, then she is pregnant.  Barring medical issues she must take an action in order to prevent the pregnancy from reaching term....it is convient to be able to tell yourself that it is not a person ""YET"" so it is ok is a crock and you know it.  If I shot a bullet in the air and it kills another human being, it is still my fault.  IF you voluntarily have sex and get pregnant...sorry but you are responsible...killing a baby is not just a bad day.

I wrote him back. And he wrote me back. And obviously, neither of us gained any ground, as we both thought we were right. Very few things get me riled up, but this guy seriously pushed my buttons. I would have liked nothing better than to tell him where I thought he could stick the gun from his bullet metaphor (but then again, I don't think he's the type that likes things up his bum- or atleast would never admit it). But then I thought of my cousin Sarah's graduation party, when my cousin Todd and I got into a screaming match over the upcoming election. Todd's arguement: Would you change quarterbacks in the middle of a game? My response (besides telling him that his arguement sucked) was yes, if the quarterback is lying about WMD and getting his teammates killed. Anyway, I have a point here. Neither of us backed down. We ended up screaming at each other across the dining room table while my poor Aunt Debbie tried to serve cake. Lesson learned: once people make up their minds, they have to change em for themselves. Maybe one day this stupid ass will have to deal with his daughter teen pregnancy. Maybe someone he knows will fall in Iraq. However it happens, and hopefully it won't take a loss or heartache, it'll be in his own terms. So after the second email, I let it go. Besides, what is a guy with a wife and kid doing on a faux-sex set up site anyway????"

"event","So I survived my first weekend in L.A. And I arrived at two very insightful well, insights: 1. the scene at the strip is not for me 2.there is a freakin mafia of Brown grads out here. I came to the first conclusion on Saturday when Dennis, J.J. (new Brown friend-so many to choose from!), Dennis' roommate Meredith and Meredith's pint sized friends from Texas went to the Standard to check out my friend Sam's birthday. While the hotel itself is pretty cool (where else can you find bubble seats and a sleeping woman literally encased in the front desk (how do you get a job like that? seriously, i want to sleep and get paid...) and the guys pretty cute, the whole thing is just darn depressing. Everyone there has whiplash from constant craning to see just who might have walked in the door. Sadly, its usually just another blond with fake boobs and some old guy with fake hair. Plus, drinks are at New York prices and frankly I don't do that outside of New York (oh, City snobbery, it will never leave me). I've had a much better time at the dive bars I've gone to here, like the one where J.J. and I met Annie at later in the night (!!!!!). Annie was here visiting her friend David, who, I must say I actually approve of (unless he's singing). 
Back to the second insight. Actually, its hard to call it me being insightful when you basically smack into someone from Brown everywhere you go. It's unbelievable- On Friday, I went out with Leah, Elaine and J.J. (All from Brown), then went to the Well and met more Brownies. Then I went to this kid's house in the hills (also from brown) and met a bunch of brits (who also-sense the pattern?-went to brown). On Saturday, while at the Standard, some girl stopped Dennis and I in the lobby-guess where she went to school? I didn't know her, but she knew us- I suppose when you're a 6'7 asian and his super hot asian friend, you leave an impression, hehe. Oh, don't get me wrong, I met some other kids this week too-Stacey, my super cool new boss,Sean and Brian, David's friends. But they all went to UPenn, damn those ivy-walls! But seriously- I glad I'm meeting so many fun new people and its really lucky that I have such a safety net out here. Cause not only are there all these Brown kids, but I also have family friends, ppl from my Cannes program and my new favorite gay boyfriend, Carl (haha-how ironic), who sold me my bed and is getting me a weekend job at his restaurant. And LINDSAY IS COMING OUT HERE TOO!!! I'm so glad I chose L.A....it was a crazy, crazy last minute decision, but apparently the right one so far..."

"event","Soooo...I decided to move to L.A. I decided on a Monday. We left on Wednesday. My dad and I packed everything that could fit in my little '99 eclipse and hit the road, bound for the west coast, stopping at every Super 8 and truck stop along the way. What I realized about the Midwest: it all looks the same. Get yourself a Walmart, Texaco, Super 8/Motel 6 and a Denny's and you can call it a town. Now I'm esconed in Leah Mann's view-awesome Silver Lake apt, have an amazing internship (sadly, no pay yet) at Red Wagon Entertainment (they have a first look deal w/ Sony and are on the lot, currently we are working on the new Bewitched with Nicole Kidman and Will Farrell, Jarhead with Jake Gyllanhaal and Memoirs of a Geshia) and am in the process of finding something that pays that does not involve me standing on a street corner begging for cash (or doing other things for it...). I realize this is a shock to all ya'll, as I was adamant on the NYC thing, but after talking to a bunch of industry types and comparing rents, I realized I had to try it out here. I wanna work in film, so duh, I have to be in L.A. And so far, I really like it. Traffic isn't as bad as I thought it would be (though I haven't hit rush hour yet- then talk to me), there are a ton of fun ppl out here, talented ones I want to work with or just get drunk with (Leah, Dennis, Farshid, Melissa, Adam, some kids from the USC track team I met in Prague) plus various family friends who I intend to hit up when I want a free meal) and the attitude is so relaxed, food is so good and everyone is as obsessed as I am with movies and tv.  And Lindsay, one of my oldest (and craziest) friends in on her way out in October! So then the two of us will find a place (or stay with Leah if her other roomie moves out) and OWN THIS TOWN. It's a little weird being so far away from my family, even at Brown they were only a car ride away, now we're talking planes, but we all have to grow up and move on, this is just how I'm doing it., in my own strange way. As my old roomate Meghan said, ""I always knew you would do something like this. It's weird, but then again, so are you."" I feel like that about sums it up. Anyway, keep checking this journal guys, I'm pretty terrible at keeping in touch, so I figured this would be the best way for all of you to learn about what I'm up to- and you know me, its sure to be reasonably entertaining!"

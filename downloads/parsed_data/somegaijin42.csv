The man takes a mid-90's fastball to the side of the face, lays on the ground for less than a minute, then GETS UP AND TAKES HIS BASE. I think the man must have balls the size and hardness of baseballs to take that one, and just shake it off!"

"event","As some of you already know, I got a speeding ticket back in late November. Tonight, I had to pay the piper and attend LaVergne Traffic Safety School. Here are the things I learned this evening.

1:&nbsp; The dude next to me had the sweetest set of dreads I've ever seen. Shoulder length, well cleaned...KILLER&nbsp;dreads. And, judging from the smell, some KILLER&nbsp;pot before he arrived as well.
2:&nbsp; The girl in front of me had the largest set of lips that are biologically possible on a human being. Don't get me wrong, I'm not making fun of something she came by naturally, as that would be rude and mean. However, I&nbsp;*WILL* make fun of the apparent fact that she had naturally large, full lips to begin with, and had apparently gotten collagen injections or something like that. They made her facial silhouette look roughly akin to a lower case 'b'.
3:&nbsp; LaVergne Police Chief [Name Withheld] has the most amazing set of mustaches I have ever seen. Nose to jawbone, thick as you can imagine. He looked vaguely like one of the guys from the old westerns.
4:&nbsp; Traffic school is expensive. The cost of the class was $55. The length of the class was approximately 60 minutes. Let me tell you, next time I&nbsp;pay roughly a dollar a minute for something, I had better be seeing something naked, or having someone talk dirty to me.

Take it from me, kids, don't speed. It's really not worth the hour of your life that you will never get back.

=P

Both Neil Gaiman, I know, but it's definitely not a bad thing to get compared to him! The whole thing's available online, but if you email the author, he'll send it in PDF too. There's a sequel also, and if you ask, he'll send it to you as well. If you don't feel like reading it directly in HTML, I've asked him for the PDFs of both, and would be happy to share.<br />

Our legislature is so wonderful that they will bow to pressure and fear mongering and spend nearly a trillion taxpayer dollars without even so much as holding hearings or considering less costly or more effective alternatives!

"event","<em>A response to <a href=""http://sethor.livejournal.com/287829.html"">this post</a></em><em> by a close friend of mine.</em><br /><br />&quot;The American Dream is that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.&quot; &mdash; James Truslow Adams, Epic of America<br /><br />True, something is wrong with the world. This I cannot deny. Change is inevitable. Change, however, is not a destination. Change is life. Change is not always good, and even in cases where it is, it is not quick or convenient. Clich&egrave; though it may be, Rome was not built in a day. Change on a large scale is not caused by those who speak of it, but those who go out and effect it.<br /><br />The American Dream certainly is not dead. Nor is it even wounded. The American Dream is that even one of low status &mdash; the homeless, the weak, the poor &mdash; have the ability to rise above their current station, and strive to be more than they are now. Look at the life of Christopher Gardner. From a year of homelessness in the early 1980's, to millionaire stock broker/investor, within but a decade! It is a song which has repeated itself thousands upon thousands of times, and even this very DAY repeats itself again. It is the song of America, the soul of America &mdash; The American Dream.<br /><br />The current financial fallout is certainly NOT due to these &quot;industrial capitalist fat cats&quot;. The blame is to be placed solely on that poison of capitalism: debt. Who truly is the fool, the one who offers a loan that the lender has no ability to pay, or the one who accepts it? And what fault is it of the large lenders, who purchased what they believed were legitimate, valuable loans from the subprime lenders? The fault, again, lies solely with those who took out these loans, with no ability or intention to pay. In some part, government regulation of a free-market economy is what is causing it. The lenders were forced by higher regulations to offer more loans to high risk lenders. They were pressured by government to offer these loans to meet Affirmative Action quotas with the loans they made. Were they allowed to loan their assets as they saw fit, free of government interruption, these &quot;subprime&quot; mortgages would never have been made. The housing bubble would never have grown large, or popped due to rampant defaults.<br /><br />Yours are the same complaints made by the &quot;hippies&quot; forty years ago, who eventually went to work and found out that the American Dream WORKS, and became the &quot;yuppies&quot;. They discovered that only by using their particular talents was true success found. Only when allowed to transcend beyond what they had been taught by their family, school, church, or employer, and REACH for what they wanted, were they able to shine. When men use their minds and their strengths, amazing things happen. Wealth is created. This is what these &quot;swine&quot; have done; they have chosen to use their talents to their betterment, and they deserve to be rewarded for it. They create value for others, and trade their products for the time and labor of others. Money is &quot;made&quot; by the efforts of these men, each according to their abilities. And the wealthy have learned that they cannot consume more than they produce. Even in today's knowledge driven economy, this remains true. <br /><br />But, are they happy? Of course! To borrow another clich&egrave;, money can't buy happiness. But the pursuit of one's dreams and goals does. The successful learned that, not only are they solely responsible for their own fates, but also their own happiness as well. The pursuit of one's dreams, and the use of one's particular talents will make one responsible for his own welfare, his own fate, his own happiness. The happily successful learned that they cannot seek happiness in other people, for people are unreliable. They cannot seek happiness in money, for money is but a tool. And they cannot seek happiness in work alone, for work itself is difficult, and drudgery. They learned to seek happiness in themselves, and became true masters of their fates and happiness.<br /><br />In all fairness, your column reads as the standard Communistic whine on &quot;Class Warfare&quot;, including the name calling. In all honesty, I read it as follows: &quot;It is so unfair! Those men used their unique talents and pursued great things, and they were rewarded for it. They created value for others, and gained value for themselves in the process! And now, we must punish them for their successess. From their high perches, they determine who lives and dies, because they will not share with the rest of us.&quot; Then GET UP, and get a chunk yourself! Use your talents to carve a niche for yourself, then fill it! Remember what you said you wanted to be when you grew up, and go do! You certainly have some gifts, some of which are unique to you. Use them to create! Use them to better the world! And before you even realize, you will have become successful. And happy.<br /><br />&quot;This is my quest<br />To follow that star<br />No matter how hopeless<br />No matter how far&quot;<br />_____<br />And Sethor, now that you've read all that, realize that I have nothing but love for you, and am entirely responding to the message, and not the man. For that reason, I let the prose go as it would, and refused to pull punches. Regardless of any differences we have, some of which have been explored here, I will still consider you a friend, as long as you'll have me as yours. Excellent piece of writing, for what it was. I figured I could use it as catalyst for a little writing exercise of my own! =D"

"event","OK, so the whole story now. As most of my friends know, I work for a major teaching hospital in the mid-south. I've been fortunate to get posted ""off-campus"", at a nice modern office building, with lots of programmers and other assorted geeks to support. The building I'm in has about 500 computers, and it has been supported by two of us, me and a guy we'll call Mr. J. Technically, I work for Mr. J, at least insomuch as he signed off my timecard. We had a nice arrangement. Officially, we both supported people scattered around the seven floors of my building. Unofficially, I covered the 1st, 2nd, and 7th floors, and half the 6th, and J covered the 5th (about 200 alone) and the other half of the 6th floors. Until last Thursday, that is. Mr. J's moving onward and upward, and is now another of the 500 people in the building. He gave notice to my department a month ago. Thus far, ""they that be on high"" have completely ignored the issue of his replacement. So my approx. 230 computers to support has jumped to the full 500-ish. And no relief in sight. For the second work day in a row, I'm completely wiped. And I know it's going to stay this way for a while. Unlike my last post, where I suspected 30d30p would continue, just in a different form, now I'm not promising much of anything. I'm going to keep writing, but it will likely be without any recognizable pattern. I didn't get very far with this project, honestly, nor did I get to any of the real projects I had in mind. I'm still going to write them, just with no time frame in mind. *shrugs* Life intervenes sometimes. And I'm not sure I was catching anyone's interest anyway.

(Don't worry, Rhistel fiction will certainly continue. Didn't think I'd abandon EVERYTHING, did'ja? =D)"

"event","OK. I'm having to seriously reconsider the scale of this project. With a full-time job, this gets to be a bit too much. Soaking 2 hours of every evening to write a thoughtful post is getting to be a bit too much. So I'm scaling back to promising one every other day, instead of my current daily schedule. I think this will have a twofold benefit. 1: I can write a larger, better prepared, more thorough post in two days than I can in one. 2: I'm only 5 days in, and already starting to burn out a little. I think that if I had a mindless job again, it wouldn't be an issue, but I've got a very mentally challenging job. I don't always want more brain work when I get home.
An alternative I had considered was shortening my post length, but -- holy crap! -- I'm having trouble knowing when to stop as it is. I could also break my post into two parts, like I did with the Rhistel fiction, but I don't necessarily write directly from beginning to end. I will almost certainly be working on something every day. And there may be times when something strikes my fancy, and I write 2-3 days in a row. We'll see how it goes from here. The experience, short though it may be so far, has certainly been fun, and has me even more interested in continuing it. Hell, if I have a good idea between now and November, I may even make a go at NaNoWriMo. But for now, lets just slow things down a bit."

Seven years since our peace was shattered. Seven years since three thousand of us lost our lives, and the rest of us lost our innocence. Seven years since we learned we were vulnerable. Seven years since we learned the steep price of complacency. Seven years since we learned that the bogeyman in the dark was real.</p>  <p>Three days later, President George W. Bush stood in the rubble of Ground Zero, the smells of death and smoke on the air, with his arm around a New York City firefighter. And we all stood with him, as we had stood together 60 years earlier, on 7 December, 1941. Just as then, the entire nation stood against the foe, and swore that we would hunt them to the ends of the earth. We had been wounded, but contrary to the enemy's expectation, we were not cowed. We were one people, with no distinctions of creed, race, religion, or politics. As was repeated aloud and in print many times over the ensuing weeks, the sleeping giant had been quite rudely awakened.</p>  <p>And yet, how quickly the giant prepares his bed again for sleep. The wounds fade with time. We tire of vigilance. We seek the easy route. Arguments spring up amongst us. Some wish to negotiate an easier peace. But the enemy remains united, and watches for the moment we again sleep, that they may strike again. For how is one to trust an agreement made by a foe who has promised your utter destruction? How do you negotiate with those who wish only your death?</p>  <p>MSN today published a quote from a Ground Zero mourner: &quot;We've kept it alive, and perhaps kept it alive too long. How many times do you reopen the wounds? It's one thing to remember, but it's another to relive it.&quot; Only one reply can fit. Keep it alive until we truly remember. Keep it alive until we learn the lesson of it: that there are those out there who want nothing less than our utter destruction, and will stop at nothing to accomplish it. Keep it alive until we learn how to treat an enemy on his knees. We must NOT let up. We must NOT cut them slack. We must press our advantages until we FINISH the job. Only then can we rest, and then, only if we stay vigilant. When one foe falls, another will undoubtedly rise to take its' place. Even in the peace which we may eventually find, we must be awake and on our feet, lest we require another 9/11 or Pearl Harbor to awaken us.</p> <br /> <em><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=""ljcut""><p>On Tuesday, 11 September, 2001, I awoke and stumbled out of my bedroom at Union University, headed for a morning shower. My roommate, Barry, called out to me. &quot;Hey, man, look at this...an airplane just crashed into the World Trade Center.&quot; I glanced into his room at his TV. &quot;Wow,&quot; I said, &quot;See if they can figure out what actually happened. I'm going to shower and get ready for class.&quot; Without thinking much more of it, I showered and shaved.</p>  <p>As I walked back from the bathroom to my bedroom to get dressed for the day, I glanced back into Barry's room. A moment later, the second plane hit. Our jaws dropped as understanding filled our heads. I rushed back into my room and dressed quickly. For a change, I still had about thirty minutes to spare before I headed out to class.</p> <p>By this time, Josh, our other roommate, was awake as well. I still remember that I never saw Josh come awake as quickly as he did that day. The three of us stood in Barry's room, unable to believe what we were seeing. As the FAA grounded all US flights, the &quot;squawkbox&quot; in our dorm room notified us that 9AM (Central) classes had been canceled, but the rest of the day's classes would continue as normal. We watched as Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, and as both towers fell.</p> <p>When we all arrived at our respective 10:30 classes, the professors were in, and led the classes in a brief moment of prayer, before dismissing us, and cancelling all further classes for the day. Union opened its' chapel, as a place for students to gather and pray together. The usually gender-segregated dorms were opened, so that siblings could be together, and others could stay with friends. The open areas on campus were silent; all of us crowded together around televisions, or in groups to pray. I remember crossing paths with a female student who I didn't know. We hugged in the middle of campus and prayed together for our nation. To this day, I never knew her name.</p> <p>Throughout the day, students filtered in and out of the unending prayer service in the chapel. In the afternoon, Josh, Barry, and I took a brief trip to Wal-Mart, to grab a newspaper, as a keepsake. Even the lowly Jackson Sun had released a full-sized Extra, with all the news that was available at the time. I've since lost that newspaper; I don't think it ever made it off Union's campus.</p> <p>Late that evening, neither Josh nor I could sleep. We walked across the street to T.J. Mulligan's, the local Irish pub. Perhaps a half dozen people were in there, and we were the only ones up at the bar. Our friend, Richard, was tending the bar. We both ordered a beer, expecting it to help us sleep. Richard tapped them, and a third for himself. We both reached for our wallets, but he held out his hand. &quot;Not today, guys. I've got these,&quot; he said. We drank the health of our country, and drank wishes of horrible death on those who had organized this. We speculated about the reasons behind it, and how different it would have been had just a few passengers been armed. When we left, it was already the 12th.</p><br /> <p>We all have stories like this to share, and I'm not sure it's ever going to be easier to tell them. Of everything I have written in my life, this truly was the most difficult. As long as I live, I know I'll never live long enough to forget that day, nor, I expect, to find  forgiveness for those who perpetrated such an attack on us. No American who was old enough to truly understand and remember was left unchanged by the events of September 11, 2001. May we never forget.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p> </em>"

"event","<em>Continuing right where we left off. Strange spot, I know, but I sorta ran out of material. *winks*</em><br /><br /><lj-cut>A thought occurred to him. &quot;Hey, do you still have the 'secret stash' down here?&quot; Rhistel said.<br />Illad looked at him conspiratorially, &quot;Of course I do. What, you think I drank the lot in such a short time?&quot;<br />Rhistel laughed aloud. &quot;I suspected that possibility, yes!&quot; he remarked with a smile. He walked to the far side of the room and searched for a moment. After a moment, he nodded to himself, and pulled on a particular book. The bookshelf swung aside to reveal another small chamber.<br />&quot;One moment, if you please,&quot; he said, as he walked into the small room. The light from the lamp in the main chamber flickered around the corners of this small hidden cache. Rhistel stepped over to a small cabinet in the far corner, knelt, and opened it. He glanced over the labels of the ancient bottles arrayed before him, before selecting one. He straightened, and took a pair of dusty goblets from the shelf above. As he wiped the dust from them with the tail of his tunic, he surveyed the small room. He, Karstan, and Illad had kept a moderate amount of liquor here, for occasions such as these.<br />Here also lay the truly forgotten treasures of House Moondown. Most of what was down here was remembered only by Illad. Several magical weapons of various size and construction hung on the walls or leaned into corners. A jeweled orb sat on a shelf, covered in dust. On a high shelf sat a massive emerald; an illusion, Rhistel knew. Illad was far too wise to keep his phylactery so out in the open.<br /> Rhistel set the first goblet down and briefly ran his fingers over the hilts of his twinned blades. They had hung on these walls for several centuries, until Illad had gifted them to Rhistel. In the corner near the secret entrance lay a metal kite shield, deep blue, with the Moondown dragon in gilt silver in the center. Rhistel had left it here on the day Illad had bestowed Weal and Woe to him. <br />He flexed his left hand cautiously and felt a brief flash of pain. The self-inflicted wound had still not fully healed. He dusted off the second goblet quickly and gathered the bottle and goblets, as well as the shield.<br />&quot;I had forgotten I had left this here,&quot; he said as the bookshelf slid back into place behind him. &quot;I have need of it now, though.&quot;<br />He sat down the glasses and poured the well-matured elverquisst into the goblets. The two performed the short ritual of the fine elven wine, then both began to sip. The baelnorn, of course, had no need of drink -- or even air, for that matter! -- but he enjoyed a &quot;nip of the bottle&quot; on occasion, and would certainly suffer no intoxication from it. As the two drank their wine, the old conversation began again. Rhistel briefly recounted his recent exploits, until his story reached Silverymoon. He told briefly of their mission there, and of the ensuing battle against the Zhentarim force. Here, he paused for a long moment, using the time to refill the cups.<br />&quot;I died there, old friend,&quot; Rhistel continued. &quot;The Banite holy warrior overpowered me...and crushed in my skull.&quot;<br />Illad's crystal clear eyes widened, but he said nothing.<br />&quot;I found myself on the Fugue Plane, and wandered there for...I know not how long. I saw many strange things there, but remember few, and can discern the meaning of even fewer still. I thought I saw my son there...but...I can barely recall.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Meanwhile, my companions had taken my body to the temple there, while Lord Sunbringer graciously gathered the materials necessary for the ancient rituals. Once my body and spirit were rejoined, I went straight away to the altar, and swore a blood oath to Shevarsh.&quot; His eyes darkened. &quot;An oath I intend to keep.&quot;<br />The venerable lich was silent for a few more moments, his eyes holding Rhistel's in a steely gaze. &quot;I see that you will,&quot; he said. &quot;but I know you, Rhistel. You are not the headstrong fool that Rhauvir is, nor are you the tenderhearted boy that Karstan was. Be careful that you do not make your life on vengeance. You, I know, are a defender of the elven people, not a champion of petty reprisal. Do not focus your sight on retribution, for I fear you will lose sight of yourself. Now, my boy, tell me more of these companions of yours...&quot;<br /><br /><br /><em>Of course, the two talked for several more hours (and most of the old bottle) before Rhistel excused himself. I had originally written more to the end of this conversation, but it didn't really seem to serve any purpose, so I&nbsp;removed it.</em></lj-cut><br />"

One advantage to this project is that I&nbsp;don't seem to feel as constrained by space as I&nbsp;would in an ordinary LJ&nbsp;post, so expect to see a more thorough exposition than I&nbsp;usually give.</em><br /><lj-cut><br />Evereska<br /><b>Autumn, 1374 DR</b><br /><br />Rhistel drew in the dank, cold air of the crypt, calming himself as he began down the long stone stairwell. The meeting with Father and Sentain had gone as well as expected, except for his brother's exceptional rashness in beginning to draw his ornamental sword. <br />&quot;If,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;he's been failing to reach Reverie for the last month, I&nbsp;can hardly blame him.&quot; <br />Something unknown and...unpleasant had kept Rhistel from finding communion in the elven rest. Instead, he had slept, in order to at least get some rest. As the daylight from above began to fade, he unshuttered his lantern ever so slightly. His eyes were easily adjusted to semi-darkness, and the eyes of the one he came to meet...well...Rhistel wasn't certain what those eyes saw.<br />Within a few moments, he reached the end of the stair. It gave way to a short passage, and beyond, a great stone hall. Into the walls of this wide and open room were set niches, in which the remains of his ancestors rested in their stone sarcophagi beneath statues bearing their likenesses. As he strode deeper into the tomb, the dust on each coffin seemed to get a bit shallower, due to their lesser age. Soon, he saw familiar faces on the statues, which he still remembered knowing in his childhood. He slowed, and walked to the last full alcove on his left, a slight mist forming in his eyes. He laid a hand gently on the inscription at the base of the newest bier.<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;"">Karstan Moondown<br /> 1196 - 1372<br />Fell defending Evereska from Phaerimm invasion</div><br />Rhistel gazed fondly at the face of his brother on the guardian statue. Karstan had been a promising High Mage candidate, until the meeting of the Weave and the Shadow Weave caused the breach of the Sharn Wall and the incursion by the Phaerimm. Rhistel had always thought the world of Karstan, and was devestated by his passing. Unlike his elder brother Rhauvir, Rhistel had always had a sort of kinship and a true friendship with his brother. <br />&quot;Tenna' ento lye omenta,&quot; he said softly. Until next we meet. He stood for a few more moments, lost in thought, then continued deeper into the crypt, his lantern casting faint shadows around him.<br />He reached the back of the massive burial chamber, and glanced briefly at the wall. &quot;Tyela neuma!&quot; he said commandingly. A heartbeat passed, then silently, a section of the wall began to slide into the floor. As it moved, a brief gust of wind whipped at his cloak, and made his lantern's flame dance slightly. When it stopped, a doorway-sized hole could be seen in the wall. He entered the short corridor beyond. He could see a slight light dancing in the room beyond, so he called out.<br />&quot;Illad?&quot; he called.<br />There was a sound somewhat like a quick drawing of breath. &quot;Master Rhistel?&quot; came the reply.<br />&quot;Of course!&quot; Rhistel replied, as he crossed the threshold into the stately room beyond. The room was somewhat round, and cozy, while not being terribly large. Nearly every available inch of wall space was dedicated to eight foot high bookshelves, on which a large variety of ancient tomes were kept. A flickering candle stood on the small table near the middle of the room, along with an inkwell, quill stand, and a large sheaf of parchments. A pair of chairs stood at the table, and a third, more comfortable-looking one stood near one bank of bookshelves. A fine blue and silver rug adorned the stone floor, and an old, but still beautiful, tapestry hung in one of the few gaps in the bookshelves. Rhistel smiled.<br />&quot;It's just as I&nbsp;remember, old friend!&quot; he said, taking in the scene. <br />The ancient elf that stood before him gestured a hand towards the ceiling in the center of the room. A small lamp hung there from the roof of the chamber, and it burst into light at the elf's motion. Rhistel looked briefly at the wizened old figure. No, old was a significant understatement. The leathery skin clutched at this elf's bones as if it would slide off by itself. A long ponytail of silver hair hung down behind his neck, and the skin of his face was sunken. His clothing looked as if it would have been in style back in the heyday of Myth Drannor. When he spoke, it was as a rasp drawing across old Vallenwood.<br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot; the aged figure replied. &quot;How long has it been?&quot;<br />&quot;Only two years,&quot;&nbsp;Rhistel said, &quot;since I&nbsp;was down here for Karstan's burial.&quot;<br />&quot;Your brother?&quot; He thought for a moment. &quot;Sentain's second son?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes, Illad. I&nbsp;apologize. I forget just how many of us you have known.&quot; Rhistel smiled fondly at the elder.<br />&quot;Fourteen hundred years' worth is a lot of Moondowns to keep track of, you know,&quot; winked Illad knowingly. For Illad was a Baelnorn: an undead lich. His time had come and passed quite a few centuries ago, and he had then made the decision to serve for nearly an eternity as advisor, tutor, and guardian to his family. He researched and performed the magical rituals that would bind his soul to an immense sapphire, which he kept hidden and magically protected in his chamber. For the last several hundred years, he had occupied this chamber, keeping out of sight and immersed in magical research.<br />Rhistel thought back again to his childhood. He and Karstan had come here often to visit with their ancestor, and had found him to be wise and pleasant. Rhistel's father, Sentain, believed him to be a relic of a bygone age, and Rhauvir actively despised the aged elf. Neither of the two had been down to this secret set of rooms for at least a century.<br /><br /><br /><br /><em>Enough for tonight.

We also lose any remaining credibility as a force in global politics, like the U.N. has many times in the past.<br /><br /><strong>2: Do you support medical marijuana?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meh. Couldn't care less. If it's really a valid medical practice, then certainly. On my stacked list, from one to ten, of political issues I&nbsp;care about, it comes in somewhere around thirty. I voted no, simply because of my lack of a preference. This could easily be a States' rights issue, and something the Federal government has no business being involved in.<br /><br /><strong>3: What's the best way to jump start the economy?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <label for=""nthreev2"">Cut corporate taxes, and give tax credits to businesses that invest in technology</label>. Basic Economics 101. The economy as a whole follows the strength of its' businesses. As businesses make money, they reinvest that money into their employees and other businesses. Watch the trends that have gone on since the introduction of Capitalism. If you pay attention to the status of small business and large enterprise in America, you can get an incredibly clear picture of how well our economy is doing. Unemployment Insurance was created as a bail-out during the Great Depression. Those who deserve it seldom take advantage of it, as they are well on the way to new employment opportunities well before their unemployment would expire. My reasoning behind this will become more clear as my complete political theory is revealed.<br /><strong><br />4: Should each state be able to decide if abortion should be legal or not?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. To me, this is clearly a States' rights issue. I'll leave the moral implications out of this one, as I feel the question could certainly be construed misleadingly.<br /><br /><strong>5: What direction should the US go in to improve health care?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage more free market health care solutions. Socialism has not worked, it does not work, and it will not work. 20th Century history is littered with clear examples of this, and yet some still refuse to notice. Others, through some misguided belief, think that, even though it has clearly failed elsewhere, it will work here.&nbsp; Government subsidized health care is another step down an extremely slippery slope: the slope of income redistribution. Socialized medicine will reduce the patient's incentive to seek inexpensive health care, it will reduce the physician's incentive to offer competitive services at low cost, quality will deteriorate, government will grow, and the people will lose another of their liberties: the right to choose. Socialized medicine has failed in Canada, failed in Great Britain, and will (would) fail here.<br /><br /><strong>6: Should we impose an extra tax on oil companies for their profits?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my response to this, see above. Taxing the oil companies' profits is simply another form of income redistribution. In this case especially, if the requirements and taxes placed upon oil companies become more onerous than is already the case, what do you expect will happen in this global market?&nbsp;That's right, the oil companies will pack up their shop and leave for warmer climes. Kick a dog once, and he'll come crawling back to lay at your feet again. Continue kicking him, and he will find another porch to lay on. The oil companies will take their profits (which they filter back into the economy) and go play elsewhere, away from government persecution of their success.<br /><br /><strong>7: What's a better way to keep America safe?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wording of this question and its' responses are distinctly slanted, and seem to have an attempt to mislead. In any case, a strong national defense is our ONLY&nbsp;option here. Pop quiz: How many square miles of surface area does the earth have? Approximately 196,939,900 square miles. What is the average size of a nuclear missile and launching system? About 20 cubic yards. Good luck securing everyone's nuclear arsenal...especially the ones that the antagonists aren't willing to tell you about.<br /><br /><strong>8: Should people without a criminal background be allowed to carry a concealed weapon?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this issue in particular, the Constitution and the founding fathers were very clear, and all stood in agreement on this issue. In fact, it was not until the 1960's that any debate about this sprung up at all. The whole people are the militia that protects America from tyranny at home. This is why history shows that, in any upstart tyrannical regime, one of the first government acts is the disarmament of the people. Mussolini, Hitler, Mao, and Yamamoto all understood this. So did Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, Washington, and virtually every other founding patriot of this great nation. A myriad of quotes are available upon request.<br /><br /><strong>9: Which is a better tax policy?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decreasing taxes for everyone. Allow me to retell a little story, originally written by David R. Kamerschen, Ph.D., an Economics Professor at the University of Georgia.<br />Every day after work, ten old friends go to the same bar to have a beer together. Their total bill always comes to $100. They agreed that they would handle the bill the way Americans handle their taxes. The poorest four pay nothing. The fifth, $1. The sixth through ninth, $3, $7, $12, and $18 respectively. The wealthiest pays, by far, the most, at $59. All ten men thought it was pretty fair, and continued drinking at this establishment for quite some time. One day, the owner threw them a curveball. &quot;Since you gents have been such good customers these past months, I'm going to offer you a special deal. I'm going to lower the total cost of your bill by $20.&quot; The ten men agreed that they would still pay their bill in the same manner that they paid their taxes.<br />The first four would still pay nothing.<br />The fifth now, as well (100%&nbsp;savings).<br />The sixth now paid $2, instead of $3 (33% savings).<br />The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).<br />The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).<br />The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).<br />The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).<br /> Each of the six paying customers were now quite a bit better off than they were. And the original four still drank for free! But shortly, they began to compare their savings. The sixth man complained &quot;I only recieved a dollar out of the refunded $20, but he,&quot; pointing to the tenth, &quot;saved $10!&quot; &quot;Yeah!&quot; exclaimed the fifth, &quot;I only got a dollar back as well! It's not fair that he saves ten times more than me!&quot; &quot;Wait!&quot; yelled the first four, &quot;We got nothing back at all! The poor are being exploited!&quot;&nbsp; Within moments, the nine had surrounded the one, and beat him to a bloody mess.<br />The next night, the tenth man was nowhere to be found, so the nine sat down for their beers without him. But when the bill arrived, they pooled their payments, and realized they didn't have enough to pay even HALF&nbsp;their bill.<br /><br />That is, in a nutshell, how our tax system works. The top 1%&nbsp;of wage earners pay 95% of the taxes. Obviously, they recieve the most benefit from a tax cut. Tax them too much, or attack them for being wealthy, and you'll quickly find that the wealthy have the means to take their wealth overseas, where America recieves no benefit from their productivity. They'll start drinking in other bars where the atmosphere is friendlier. They, along with the businesses of America, drive our economy.<br /><br /><strong>10:&nbsp;Do you support offshore drilling?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By all means. They're our resources. Let's use them, instead of throwing our money at the resources of the Middle East and Venezuela. We can easily keep our money here, and use it to grow our economy, instead of the economy of Dubai. By no means do I&nbsp;think this should be exclusive with seeking alternative energy production methods, but in both the short and long term, it's the only way we can begin to secure energy independence from the hostile Middle East.<br /><br /><strong>11: How do you feel about the UN?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither of the answers do I&nbsp;agree with. The UN&nbsp;has continually proven itself to be an impotent organization, incapable of carrying out even the simplest of resolutions. In recent years, the UN&nbsp;has even become increasingly hostile to the United States. These problems have only been more well defined since 9/11. However, I also don't support the creation of some &quot;Bizaaro UN&quot;, headed by the United States. I support our withdrawl from the UN, and do not support the allowing our resources and foreign policy to be dictated by any foreign body.<br /><br /><strong>12: Should balancing the federal budget be a priority?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitely. How about a little actual fiscal responsibility in our government??<br /><strong><br />13: What's the best way to fix public education?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide more options for a competitive market. If there's one thing that our education system continues to prove, it's that throwing money at a problem will not solve it. Create a competitive education market, and let the market decide. I'll expound more on this later.<br /><br /><strong>14: Do you support nuclear energy?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheap, clean, and safe, versus cheap, dirty, and dangerous. Yep, I'll go with increasing our nuclear energy resources any day of the week. Thanks to the Tennessee Valley Authority, I'm using mostly nuclear power right now, in composing this post. Bring it on.<br /><br /><strong>15: Do you think gun manufacturers can be liable for crimes committed with guns?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. Under no circumstance. A gun is a tool. Please report to my classes later this month, Personal Liberty and Personal Responsibility 101, and Gun Ownership 101.<br /><br /><strong>16: Do you support the death penalty for &quot;drug kingpins&quot;?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nah, not really. This one comes in right above #2 on the list of &quot;Issues I&nbsp;care about&quot;.<br /><br /><strong>17:&nbsp;What's the best way to save Social Security?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, since &quot;scrap it&quot; isn't an option, I'll go with privatization. It's my money. I earned it. Now let the Federal government get the hell out of the way, while I&nbsp;use it as I&nbsp;see fit. Social Security is so damaged right now that it is beyond anyone's ability to fix. On the subject of raising the payroll tax on the wealthy, see above.<br /><br /><strong>18: Do you think the US Constitution is a living document, subject to changing interpretation?</strong>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, nor was it intended to be. It's written in fairly clear language. I know, I've read it. Bench legislation is one of the most disturbing trends I've seen in recent years. If you want to change what the constitution says, by all means, pass an amendment. We already have a mechanism in place for it. Our government is divided into three branches for a reason, and the Judicial branch tends to dangerously increase their own power via bench decisions. The Supreme Court are sworn to uphold the Constitution, not interpret it.<br /><br /><strong>19: Do you support increasing the minimum wage?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. More basic economics. The minimum wage is not meant to be a living wage, but a true minimum. I understand that we must have some variety of minimum in place to prevent the abuse of the worker. But a higher minimum wage raises inflation by decreasing the value of the dollar. Those on minimum wage will not get any further buying power thanks to their increase, but those of us making more than minimum wage suddenly have less by comparison. The raising of minimum wage is another policy that has failed in the past, and continues to fail now.<br /><br /><strong>20: Did the troop surge in Iraq work?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. Even the most staunch opponents of the surge have been recently forced to admit that they were wrong.&nbsp; The surge is the method by which we should have been fighting the war from the beginning; with overwhelming force.<br /><br /><strong>21: Should partial birth abortions be banned?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll get to this one later as well. My opinion on it extends beyond a simple &quot;yes or no&quot; answer. My short answer is a definite &quot;yes&quot;, however, there is enough material in this answer to fill a whole other post.<br /><br /><strong>22: Should the government help home owners who are about to foreclose on their homes?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, unless they were tricked by their lenders. It's certainly not my place to pay the mortgage that you could never afford. I don't want my tax dollars doing it either.<br /><br /> <strong>23: Do you think the prospects are good for negotiating with Iran?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. We, along with the UN, have been negotiating with them for quite a few years now. They have certainly never acted in good faith, or given the slightest sign that they intend to obey any sanction placed upon them. <br /><br /><strong>24: In general, US international policy should be concerned with:</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meh. Dumb question, with equally dumb answers, phrased as if the two were mutually exclusive.<br /><br /><strong>25:&nbsp;How do you feel about the military's &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policy?</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I&nbsp;feel? Completely indifferent. I don't even recall what I clicked here, as it was about two hours ago.<br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Sometimes, when you least need or expect it, reality kicks you in the seat of the pants. When I&nbsp;started this project last night, I had no idea that I wasn't going to be sleeping particularly much afterward. A combination of a sore back from sitting in my work chair all day and a million post ideas in my head kept me up the better part of last night. I had to move to the couch, and only ended up getting about two hours of sleep out of the deal. As such, I've been trying to write *anything* for the better part of an hour, but I&nbsp;can barely put three coherent thoughts together. Hence, today's title: Day 1.5. I can't help but feeling this is an extreme cop-out on my part, but I&nbsp;simply cannot put together anything worth writing. To at least make some progress on the project, here's a standing list of posts/concepts I&nbsp;have planned.<br /><br /><u>Fiction</u><br />&quot;Rhistel and Cara&quot; - on Human/Elf love and marriage<br />Rhistel:&nbsp;Interview with the Baelnorn - Rhistel catches up with an OLD friend<br />Something &quot;modern-era&quot;<br />Something &quot;Sci-fi&quot; - Maybe. Not sure this idea interests me. We'll see...<br />Humor - A sample post from a potential blog of mine &quot;The Comic Misadventures of an IT&nbsp;Wage Slave&quot;. Will likely only qualify as semi-fictional.<br /><br /><u>Non-Fiction</u><br />&quot;Finding the Shrine&quot; - The journey to baseball heaven<br />History - Probably something WW II&nbsp;related. Planning this one to be well-researched. I may cheat on this one, and write it over the course of several days, so I&nbsp;can cite references, etc.<br />&quot;Tech and Tabletop&quot; - Role Playing Games and technology. DM'ing with a laptop.<br />Training - A training document and experiment in technical writing. Likely will be dry and pedantic.<br />My Failed Sports Season - The year EVERY&nbsp;team I support in EVERY&nbsp;sport abandoned me, and I&nbsp;took up following EPL&nbsp;football (soccer) out of spite. <br /><br /><u>Opinion</u><br />SEVERAL&nbsp;posts in my head regarding faith, religion (not the same thing), reason, and intellectual honesty. What I&nbsp;believe, and why.<br />Political theory and opinion - Again, what I&nbsp;believe and why.<br />Product Review - No idea what I'll review, but I&nbsp;plan to do at least one of these.<br />Rant - Hey, everyone needs a good rant now and then.<br /><br /><u>Other</u><br />Poetry - Maybe. My creativity doesn't usually extend towards an &quot;artistic&quot; direction. I consider this one unlikely, but I may make a go at it.<br />Stream of Consciousness - Just for kicks. This stuff's usually bizarre, but can be fun to read. Might not do this one either.<br /><br />Hey, I'm counting a solid 20+ posts there!&nbsp;This might not be so bad after all! I'm certainly not counting my inability to concentrate as a failure in this project. In all honesty, I picked a poor time to start. I'm headed to Cincinnati tomorrow, for the weekend, and I&nbsp;have been counting on having Internet access at the hotel, so I&nbsp;can put up posts in the evening, but if that doesn't go as planned, I'll be writing the posts by hand and posting them here on my return. In the meantime, I'm going to bed...<br /><br />--<br />Choran<br /><br />"

"event","This is the beginning of a project I should have started on 1 September, instead of today. The short version first, for the ADD&nbsp;afflicted: I'm going to write thirty major LJ&nbsp;posts over the next thirty days. I'm going to cover lots of things in lots of styles. OK, ADD&nbsp;folks...go ahead and ride your bikes now. ;)<br /><br /><p>I've been considering taking on a project like this for several months now, but through procrastination, fear (of success and/or failure), and general laziness, I've put it off for quite some time. Simply put, I'm tired of being a wage slave. I've been wanting to try my hand at a bit of blogging, technical writing, and miscellany, but I've been playing a waiting game with myself. No longer. I'm going to tackle this project in order to see for myself if writing for a living is something that interests me, something I&nbsp;have the attention span and creativity for, and something that really would work for me. For the next month of days, I'm going to make one post here per day. I'm going to try my hand at different writing styles, formats, and topics. I'm going to go far out on a limb, risking giving up my fears, to see if this is a course of action I&nbsp;can follow. Some of the posts I&nbsp;make here may find their way onto some of the new blogs I've reserved. I'm going to risk losing friends by putting my opinions out on public display. I&nbsp;intend to write a veritable plethora of new content on topics such as RPGs, Technology, Web programming, baseball, politics, and religion. I'm going to try my hand at some fiction, non-fiction, (auto)biography, technical writing, and anything else that strikes my fancy over the next month.&nbsp; Some days may even be in the modern personal blog style. Any of my friends suggesting Iambic Pentameter will be told to go to Hell. ;-)&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from that, the only other restriction I'm going to place on it is that it will be work-safe. No erotica or &quot;adult topics&quot; from me, and only strictly &quot;necessary&quot; profanity. I want to be able to show all these to my family when they ask &quot;But, how did you get started in writing?&quot; I'm going to make all writings public, so that my writing can be available for peer review and critique. And I'm opening myself to topic and style suggestions. I'm considering even tacking my real name to some of them.&nbsp; I'm not placing any word/length minimums or maximums. I'll use what it takes to accomplish my goal in the writing. And if I&nbsp;fail, I'll fail hard. &nbsp;I suspect that the first week or two will certainly be the defining time for me, and by the end, I'll understand how well this will fit for me. I know that blogging for a living is becoming a very possible form of income, and I&nbsp;might just want a chunk of that business model.<br /><br />So here's the part I open up to my friends. Here's where you get to help, if you want. Topics are most certainly being accepted in the comments below. For me to be sucessful at this means I'll have to be able to come up with consistent new content, and I'll have to draw topics from anywhere I&nbsp;can find them. Anything you guys want to hear from me about? Anything about me that you want to know, or anything you want to learn about? I can't guarantee I'll use any/all of the topics suggested, but they will all receive some attention and consideration from me. I've got several topics lined out already, but certainly not thirty! Also, my writings are going to be available for critique, either contextually or gramatically. Feel free to be as harsh as you like. Of course, glowing praise is always acceptable! I'll have to grow a slightly thicker skin to make a life out of this as it is, and I&nbsp;certainly retain the right to defend my writings. Just like you get to retain the right to ignore them, if you prefer. I'm certain that all my posts won't interest all of you. Heck, I'll be lucky if *any* of them interest *any* of you... In any case, consider this &quot;Day 1&quot;, and today's post made! <br /><br />--<br />Choran<br />&nbsp;</p>--11th hour edit:&nbsp; Man, I'm going to have to clean up these paragraphs...<br />One last note: I don't plan on &quot;stocking up&quot;&nbsp;on posts. Generally, I plan to write them on the days I&nbsp;post them. If the muse strikes, I may write two posts in one day, just to take a weekend day off, but these will be the exception. The weekday posts will be written on that day.<br />"

Invites to this group have been sent out to all you folks, and I've gotten some responses back. This post is basically here to list our basic house rules, so everyone can be familiar with them before we start. They're all...<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""behind a f*ck-all big cut""><br />On another note, a change of venue has taken place, and we'll be running it at La Casa de Khinsah. The only thing we still have to determine is our start time. I'm fine with starting around 1:30-2:00, like we used to in Khin's game, or at ~6:00, as we have been of late. I leave that one up to you folks.<br /><br />1. <b>Action Points</b> - Eberron style action points are in. I've run with them before, and they completely rock. See <a href=""http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/actionPoints.htm"">here</a> for the base rules. In the section called ""Improving Feats"", I'll certainly allow this sort of stuff on a case-by-case basis. Bottom line is ""Don't try to abuse it, and I'll probably let you do it."" ;-)<br /><br />2. <b>Vitality/Wound Points</b> - No more HP! This is one I've seen before, but never gotten to use. See <a href=""http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/vitalityAndWoundPoints.htm"">here</a> for these rules. There may be some minor changes here, but nothing serious. <br /><br />3. <b>The Dodge Feat</b> - Anyone else notice that, except as a prerequisite, the Dodge feat really sucks?? I give up a feat slot for a paltry +1 bonus to AC...which is ONLY against a single opponent?? Man, I got screwed there...&nbsp; The new Dodge:<br /><blockquote><h3 id=""dodge"">Dodge [General]<br /></h3>Prerequisite: Dex 13<br />Benefit: You gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. During your action, you may designate an opponent and receive an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks from that opponent. You can select a new opponent on any action.<br />A condition that makes you lose you Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose these dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most other types of bonuses.<br />Special: A fighter may select Dodge as one of his fighter bonus feats.<br /></blockquote>Better, and actually worth a feat slot for some people?<br /><br />4. <b>Death and Dying</b> - Maybe this game, I'll get my first PC kill! *Grins evilly*&nbsp; If that happens, I use significantly modified rules on death. The VP/WP system mentioned earlier significantly changes what it takes to actually die, but I also change the effects of being raised. Removing a level from a PC really sucks. So instead, any PC who dies and is raised is charged with a negative level (-1 to all D20 rolls, -5 HP, -1 spell slot of highest castable level). This level cannot be removed by any means, including <i>WIsh</i> and <i>Miracle</i> spells or <i>Restoration</i>. Instead, this negative level goes away the next time the PC levels. You can accrue multiple negative levels, but you only gain a single one back when you level. So don't do dumb things and die repeatedly, and you'll be fine! Please direct questions to /dev/null. ;-)<br /><br />5. <b>Races, Classes, and et cetera</b> - Due to the unique nature of what I've got planned, race and class selections are not entirely open. Human is default. I'll allow for one Elf, and one Dwarf, Halfling, or Gnome. I'm using one of the retconns planned for 4E that states that Elves and other demihumans mature at about the same rate as humans, but live longer in the long run. So, in this case, an 18 year old Elf is roughly equivalent to a 16 year old human. I hadn't planned on allowing ""gender-bending"", because we had a decent ratio of sexes in the group. Due to some changes, that ratio's changed, so I'll allow it for at least one of the guys (Sorry, Geiju-hime). Fark you guys, if you think I'm going to let all the boys play girls, and the girls play guys.&nbsp; =P&nbsp; I do tend to allow for some non-PHB classes, but not terribly exotic ones. It's going to be situationally judged at best, and arbitrarily judged at worst.<br /><br />6. <b>Technology</b> - I'm gonna try simplifying things significantly by heavily using my laptop as a second DM screen. In most cases, the dice rolls will still be real. There's some aesthetic to dice that I just can't duplicate with a virtual dice roller. And I don't really trust random( ) algorithms. But for keeping lists, records, and rules handy, it should save quite a bit of paper shuffling. If it becomes a distraction, I'll obviously stop. But I'm thinking of going so far as to keep combat grids on it, so everyone can see what's going on. I've found LOTS of free programs that do lots of cool stuff that should help immensely, and keep the game flowing.<br /><br />7. <b>Write-ups, diaries, etc</b> - I do certainly accept your own creative writing on the happenings in the game. I'm not allowing character histories in this one, though. Suffice to say, life's been remarkably normal up to this point. Until the game starts, write-ups will be accepted, read, enjoyed, and then summarily discarded, with prejudice. ;-)&nbsp; I do give out XP for write-ups (or other similar materials), at a rate of 50XP * ECL. At most, one per session, please.<br /><br />That's about it, as far as the starting set of house rules goes. Khin's the only one of you guys who's ever played under me, so he knows how I tend to roll. The rest of you guys should be able to catch on fairly quickly. <br /><br />Keep thinking about a basic archetype you want to fit into. Along those lines, let me just say this: You guys will all be starting off in your late teens. 15-18. No backstories. They haven't been written yet. That's what we're going to do. You will all be a nearly clean slate to start off. I would love to see some actual interpersonal relationships, though. I'd be highly impressed to have a pair of brothers (or other siblings) or even a pair of sweethearts. I leave that all up to you guys. </div><br /><br />Oh, and it farking figures...<a href=""http://www.montecook.com/cgi-bin/page.cgi?mpress_BOXM"">http://www.montecook.com/cgi-bin/page.cgi?mpress_BOXM</a>. A whole Monte Cook book (Cook Book...hehe) of experimental rules. =(<br /><br />So, until Sunday, try and get your head around the basic house rules, and get some ideas in mind, so I can destroy those ideas later. =D&nbsp; Feel free to comment with questions, criticisms, or concerns. Questions will be answered, criticisms and concerns will be ignored. See you Sunday!<br /><br />--<br />Gaijin<br />Just another D20 hacker."

For some of us, it's just one less in the pile, but for me, it brings my total to nil. I've had several people now suggest that I run something. Until this morning, I'd been completely idea-less as far as a concept was concerned, but I've had a revelation, and do actually have something in mind. I do have some reservations and concerns which I'm going to address first, however. Any interested parties should investigate <div class=""ljcut"" text=""behind the cut.""><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK. So you're still reading. That's a good thing! Let's jump right into it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, anything I run will be a ""fill-in"" game.It'll keep us off the streets until Khin's ready to start back up. It may die without notice. As long as we all know that, it shouldn't be a problem. I'm gonna miss Khin's game just as much as the rest of you, and I hope we get back to it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, if I run something, it'll be highly experimental, especially since it's filler. It'll be 3.5 D&amp;D, and probably in a familiar setting, but I've seen quite a few optional rules I want to give a shot. Action points, wound points, things like that. Don't be too surprised if we try a new house rule one week, just to find out it doesn't work, and switch away from it on later weeks. The idea for a story I have in mind is fairly experimental as well, but should work well with the group I've got.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, and this one may offend some, the only people that I'm opening this up to are the ones already in Khin's FR game, and my wife (I *do* still want to get laid again this decade ;) ). This is primarily because of my first point; I want to use it to fill the time slot, and people who aren't in Khin's game might be pretty disappointed when my game drops to go back to his. Plus, that brings the potential total to seven players, which is quite a lot for me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I intend to run it at my apartment, as well. There are a number of reasons for this. It will help minimize the impact ""Little Gaijin"" will have on our game. It's also to be a little more fair to Khin, as he kinda seems to be the ""default"" host, thanks to owning a house. It'll get him out of the house a bit. I've done some looking around at the house, and I'm fairly certain I've got at least as much room as he does, so it shouldn't be *too* packed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I know who all wants to take part, I'll release more details, and figure on a time frame for it. I STRONGLY suspect it'll run around 5:30-6:00 PM on the ""Khin's game"" Sundays, and we'll probably go until about 10:00 or so.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for anyone still interested, DON'T start working up a backstory for a character. DON'T start rolling anything up. DO start thinking about a couple basic personality traits or quirks. DO start thinking about the general type of character you want to play. Character generation for this one is going to be...a little odd (experimental!), so I don't want to end up with the cart before the horse. I said all that to say this: ""Who's in?"" :)</div>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, so I'm finally breaking down and forcing myself to write this post. It's been bouncing around my head for quite some time, and I'm not having to come up with anything I didn't already know...it's just been a matter of forcing myself to sit down and actually write it out. I'd put it behind a cut, but the only people who read my journal are in Khin's game anyway, so you already know what you're getting. =P

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhistel Moondown was born on Marpenoth 12, 1219 DR. He was the third son of a prominent Evereskan family, and for the first 50-60 years, enjoyed the celebrated status that earned him. When his eldest brother, Rhauvir, began the diverse training expected of a firstborn, who would one day be head of the house, Rhistel found his position as third son made him little more than extra. His middle brother, Karstan, took a position with the arcane academy, and showed all the signs that he could become a powerful High Mage in his time. Rhistel never got along well with his eldest brother, but his younger brother understood what it was like to stand in another's shadow, and understood Rhistel better than any other. After the family runeblade selected Rhauvir to succeed his father, Rhauvir selected Karstan as his adviser, and Rhistel found himself pushed farther into obscurity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To attempt to make a name for himself, Rhistel joined the Evereskan Tomb Guard. While in this service, he met a beautiful human woman, Cara, and the two married, much to the consternation of Rhistel's elven family. Once his first child, Althalus, was born, the two relocated to Silverymoon, to help Althalus avoid the stigma of being a ""half-man"". They found the atmosphere in Silverymoon to be much more tolerant to mixed-race unions, and soon had a second child, Caela.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passed, and Rhistel watched as his wife grew older before his very eyes. In 1366, she died, of old age. Althalus, having moved to Waterdeep several years ago, no longer seemed to find time or need to return home once his mother had died. Caela found a human husband, and settled down in Silverymoon. After a year of mourning passed, Rhistel found himself without direction. He soon joined up with a passing adventuring company, and began to tour Faerun. For the next several years, Rhistel did not stay in one place particularly long. He visited his family in Evereska, but he still seemed to have no real place there. He left with bitterness in his heart at the fact that he had no place in the family.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1372, a magical accident caused the Sharn Wall to be breached, and the evil Phaerimm to be released from their ancestral prison. They quickly laid siege to Evereska, and laid waste to much of the area. In the ensuing war, Karstan Moondown was slain. When word reached Rhistel, he hurried back to Evereska, arriving just in time for his brother's funeral. Immediately after the ceremony, Rhauvir approached him, and demanded that Rhistel take his brother's place as advisor to Rhauvir. Rhistel refused, and the two nearly came to blows over it. Rhistel left, determined to not return.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon thereafter, Rhistel found himself in Shadowdale. While there, he joined up with another adventuring group, this one led by a paladin devoted to Berronar Truesilver. Rhistel found himself enjoying their company, and traveled with them for some time. They headed into Cormyr, to visit the family of their healer, a Drow Priestess of Elistraee. While there, Rhistel found a full city of benevolent Dark Elves, living in seclusion. After some conflict with Vhaerun worshipping elves in the area, the Drow realized they needed to open communications with Cormyr and other surrounding nations, in order to secure a true surface home for themselves. Rhistel found himself acting in the role of diplomat, as he had contacts with most of the interested parties in the area. For the last year, Rhistel has been traveling with the Drow clan, and helping to open negotiations with Cormyr, Evereska, and other surface settlements. This work left him bored, however, and he&nbsp; headed towards Waterdeep, hoping to meet back up with the adventuring party he had followed to the Drow settlement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhistel Moondown stands 5'2"", and weighs about 135 pounds. He is slim and wiry, with the fine muscles of a practiced martial artist. His face is a bit rounder than most elves, with a strong jawline, and fewer angles than most of the rest of his race. When he was a child, this led to teasing from other children, and (truly unfounded) implications of human blood in his lineage. Despite these differences, he is quite handsome; pale, with dark hair that he always keeps pulled back. He is beginning to show streaks of gray at his temples, and he attributes this to the time spent with his human wife. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Rhistel seems to have aged alongside her, and has lost much of the typical elven patience. His sense of time became adapted to human life, and even now, he feels that elves move FAR too slowly for his liking. He also has a sharp tongue and a dryly sarcastic sense of humor, which he also attributes to his wife's influence. He is stern, but kind; warm in true friendship, and fearsome in battle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhistel fights with a twinned pair of shortswords, a gift from the Evereskan Tomb Guard. Both were created to defend the elven people. He is ambidextrous, and in combat, his twin blades become a complete blur. The blades seem to have secrets of their own, and far more power than is readily apparent. Rhistel is now beginning to research the history of Weal and Woe (as he calls them), and will likely begin consulting wise sages about them in the near future."

"event","<b>Shieldmeet, 1320 DR</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All assembled were silent, save the High Mage and the High Priest of Corellon Larethian. Their chanting echoed through the high-ceilinged festival hall of House Moondown. Sentain Moondown sat silently at the high seat, lost in prayer to the Seldarine. The chanted prayers and magic combined within the Mythal to create a magic nearly as deep as time itself. Soon, the prayers and chanting ceased.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Rhauvir Moondown, step forward,"" the High Priest intoned.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhauvir advanced slowly from his place in the front row. He could not keep his eyes from the moonblade, with its line of ancient runes, laid across his father's knees. He knelt in the proper place before his father, slightly on Sentain's right. Sentain seemed to wake from his prayers, and drew his hand down to the haft of the ancient weapon. The pure white moonstone in the hilt seemed to blaze with a light all its own as the patriarch of House Moondown took the sword in his hand.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Take the sword,"" came the command from the ancient High Mage.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhauvir's eyes rose to meet his father's. Slowly, Sentain reversed his grip on the sword, and offered it to Rhauvir. The moonstone flashed brightly, as Rhauvir's hand grasped the hilt. Raw magic seemed to coalesce out of the air around the two.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sentain removed his hand from the crossguard of the sword as the magic swirled faster. The glow of magic was almost a tangible thing. It passed over Rhauvir several times, before moving down his arm and into the blade. The runes etched into the blade began, one at a time, to glow. There was a final flash of magic and light. As the afterglow faded, those assembled could see a new rune etched deeply into the metal of the blade. It had accepted Rhauvir.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Karstan Moondown, step forward,"" the High Priest intoned.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karstan stepped from his place. He still retained the facial features of his father, but his build was much slimmer, and less muscular. His novice's robes swished softly as he took his place on his father's left. As he approached, Rhauvir stood, facing him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The High Mage spoke again. ""Karstan, you now are in your proper place at your father's feet, and your brother's side.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhauvir reached out his hand, and they clasped forearms. The assemblage cheered loudly. The ceremony had been completed. Sentain Moondown's succession had been decided. Rhauvir reached to his father's side and retrieved the moonblade's scabbard. As he handed the blade back to his father, he did not notice a single slim figure slipping out the back of the room."

"event","<b>Spring, 1260 DR</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy feinted, and lunged quickly, his black hair streaming behind him in the breeze. His thrust fell wide, and his instructor swatted him with the flat of his blade. Hard. In shock and surprise, the boy dropped the short wooden sword from his right hand. Caelan Evenstar, the Moondown family master-at-arms drew back for a final stroke.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Boy, you give away too much with a wild attack like that. How many times have I told you: You MUST wear your opponent down before committing yourself that fully to the attack. Your skills improve, but you are far too impatient! If I didn't know your father and family better, I'd say you had some human in you! Now, pick that sword back up. We're doing the exercise again!""<br /><b><br />Spring, 1317 DR</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy feinted, and lunged quickly, his black hair streaming behind him in the breeze. His thrust was right on target, but was deflected at the last moment by a firm parry from his instructor's blade. The boy darted in quickly, following with his left hand sword. Steel rang again in the morning air as the second thrust was parried. Caelan Evenstar jumped back several feet to put some distance between himself and his youthful charge. Pressing the advantage, the boy swung again, followed by a downward stroke that set the man-at-arms back on his heels. With a final ring of clashing steel, the master's sword flew free, point sinking several inches into the soft ground nearby. The boy raised his blades for a killing stroke, and held it for a moment before lowering them. He slid them silently into their scabbard, beaming broadly. Caelan nodded to the young elf-lord before him, before retrieving and sheathing his sword.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""For five years, I have seen this day coming. I had, perhaps, not expected it to be so soon. There is nothing more I can teach you, boy. Your training with me is complete. Your father would be proud of you.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword master gazed for a moment at the youth before him. The lad was slim, but solid, with wiry muscles obviously capable of producing great speed. His features seemed broader than most, with a strong jawline more reminiscent of those of humans, but the angular cheekbones and eyes, and the long, swept back ears belied his pure elven heritage. Many were the times that he had teased the boy over his appearance, and his human-like impatience. But those days were no more. Caelan regarded the boy for a moment more, fondly, but as an equal. He laid an arm over the youth's shoulder as the two walked off the practice yard."

"event","<b>Autumn, 1219 DR</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was late afternoon. The sun began its slow slide through the green and verdant boughs of the elven city of Evereska. A scream of labor pain drifted down from the home in the boughs above. The small crowd gathered below gasped softly in anticipation. It could not be long now. Soon, the cries of the woman ceased, immediately followed by the strong wail of a newborn babe. Moments later, the strong visage of Sentain Moondown appeared at the entrance to the home above. In his arms, he cradled a small bundled form. He gazed at it momentarily, then raised it high, first to the afternoon sun, then to the crowd below. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""A SON!!!"" he yelled triumphantly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assembly below burst into cheering and applause. A third son! And they were there to see him on his naming day! The birth of any child was greeted with celebration in the elven kingdoms, but how blessed had Sentain and Elora Moondown been! Three children! It is very uncommon for elven families to have more than one or two births over several hundred years! But all three were sons; not a daughter among them! The final rays of the sun's afternoon light kissed the babe's forehead. Sentain glanced down at the child again, before a brief wave to the crowd and a return inside to the child's mother. The revel began."

"event","So I finally broke down and got an LJ page. *sigh*&nbsp; I am not, and have never been a big supporter of ""The Social Internet"". As I recall, I had a 5-digit ICQ number that got used for maybe a week. The first thing I do after installing Windows is to disable Windows Live Messenger. I've never had a blog, or even a website. People who have emailed me in the past know that I sometimes take days or weeks to reply. Generally, I'd FAR rather talk to someone via phone, or *gasp* live and in person. But, generally speaking, I know lots of stuff surrounding the RP group (and friend group, and whatever else group! =P) I'm in tends to happen over LJ. I'm fine with that, but have avoided joining this conversation until now. 
But, now I figure, why let the DM have all the fun in reading various things written about, or even by, my character? Why not share the interesting bits with the party? Who knows? It may bore you all to tears to read the various exploits of my characters and adventuring groups. It's weeks of sleeping in hedgerows and eating iron rations, punctuated by moments of glory and terror. Kinda like the military, I suppose. Fortunately, we generally get to glaze over the gory details of the adventurer's day-to-day, and focus on those moments that make characters and campaigns memorable. Then again, you may enjoy it. But, I digest [sic]...

Coming soon, the tale of Rhistel Moondown, husband, father, Evereskan Tomb Guard, wanderer, erstwhile diplomat, adventurer.&nbsp; Until then, watch this space!

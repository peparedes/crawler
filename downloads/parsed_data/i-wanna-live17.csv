"event","wow lately everything has been crashing down on me. just a lot of things goign on my head and juat alot that i can handle im seriously going to have to give up on everuthing. slowly ive let some things go. and it sucks cause everthing that i want to do nobody seems to understand. im just one girl who is going threw a lot and doesnt like talking to anyone. why bother if everything else i did was on my own. what will you do to help... it seems like there is alot that i want to change about myself. im ready to face this world. but then again im scared that i will fail and have to go running to the people i dont want to go run to. im scared that everything bad they told will come true. but then i have to think about my friends and i know which ones will be there for me and which ones will just leave me. ive lost so many in the past and now when people leave its like nothing to me. its sad really. but then again what can i do. how can i tell you whats going on wit me when i dont even know whats going on. this sucks a bunches. why cant life be easy for me.. everything will be fine and then the next thing i know everything just crashes. and sometimes i feel like there is something missing. somthing inside me just wants to scream and i think i know what it is but i keep putting it behind me... ahhhhhhhhhhhhh that all i want to do is scream from the top of my lungs. i think the best way to handle everythign is just be on my own..&nbsp;

"event","so i went to eat today with my mom at wendy's and it was really emotional. we started talking about how im almost graduating and just starting talk about how much work it took me to get there. i started crying just due to the fact that everything i did was on my own. not once did i go running to family for help. the time i needed them&nbsp;all they could did was put me down. ""your so stupid"" ""your not going to graduate"" is what i would always hear. and just telling my mom that she comes out saying that she never gave up&nbsp;on me. its funny how she says that but sometimes she made feel that she did. i think the saddest part is that my own family never believe in me. well FUCK them cause i showed them that i was able to do it wit out their help. and to top it off i got a $500 scharlorship for the school of my choice. so there have them now start talking their shit.&nbsp;

there is a bery good lesson learned here. "" dont start talking your shit to early cause you never know whats going to happen in the end"""

Mmmmm they were good.. lol well let see other then that my day was good. i went to work at disney at the inn between. it was boring cause i didnt know anyone but then again it was fun cause of the lady there. all they did was speak spanish to me.. lol.. and yea oh yea the guy at red robin was a lil cute but he needed to shave those side burns but his eyes where adorable. lol. but yea other then that my day was fun. i cleaned my roon before i left and it look so good. I have a floor.. it so clean im so proud of myself... but yea that is pretty much my day. i talk to one of my friends and i feel so bad for her but then again im kind of whatever with her. she is doing her own thing. i dont approve cause i believe she is moving to fast with what she is doing but then again its her life. and well i have my own things to worry about.&nbsp;<br /><br />so yea that is pretty much it.... </p>"

"event","so junior year is absolute insanity. there's no other word for it. i have more homework than i've ever had in my life, i try harder than i ever have in school, and i get worse grades than i ever have before. and then there's the c word. college. drat - i'm moving to australia. 
besides school, life is improving. things with my parents have settled down a little bit, and cross country was fantastic. i somehow was able to run like a 4 second faster 400 the other day for a speed workout and i'm hoping that i can stay in shape and run a LOT faster for indoor. ahh i'd be so excited. Chelsea and i are going to Fitzy sometime to time 400s...i'm so pumped for high jump again too, even though it's frusterating. 
so its the day before Homecoming and guess who doesnt have a dress? hehehe...me. should be an interesting 24 hours.
i think junior year is a big year of change. at least for me, its the year where i realize that i'm the one in charge. it also seems to be the year when you realize who your true friends are. all of us seem so busy, and everyone's flying around in different directions, so its hard to stay in touch. but the ones who are really important always seem to be there when you need them. 
anyways that's my profound statement of the month.
today was a pretty fabulous day all in all. pep rallys are pretty much my favorite thing ever. it was purple and white day and of course i rocked the bright purple spandex. tonight's the team dinner and tomorrow is regionals, homecoming game, then homecoming! :) courtney's doing my hair (even though i dont know what i'm wearing yet, at least my hair will look nice) 
right so i'm off to do my gallons of homework for this weekend so i can relax tomorrow and not freak out on Sunday when it's not done."

"event","oh man, what a great day! this morning i ran 3 miles with the cross country team, then courtney picked me up and we drove (slightly illegally) to scarborough beach to meet up with chelsea and her surfing excitement. so courtney tried to learn how to surf and did really well, and i took pictures of her and chelsea surfing - yaay! i'll try to learn someday, like maybe next summer or something. so we stayed there for a long time and i actually got TANNER on my stomach! ahh weird, so maybe my one piece tan will go away a little bit. so i got home at like 1:30 and hung out and rested and kind of took a nap...i dont know if i actually fell asleep but Dylan woke me up and i played with him for a while. then i had a family dinner and got ready for the football game. at 6:30 i went to chelsea's and we got all purtied up and went to the game. Deering lost. boo. i think we're not that great this year because we've been so amazing in the past that nothing can live up to it. but i guess football games aren't as great this year as they have been before. hmm...well i got to see Lindsey too and we speculated about butts. yeah we're weird. Then Chels and i left early because um...it wasnt that entertaining anymore, and hereafter follows a fantastic tale of adventure and wit....

it was a dark and stormy night. the two spies, agent J and agent A were on a secretive mission: to somehow successfully infiltrate the johnson household at 10 o clock at night. disguised as two teenage girls, they obtained a key from a friendly neighbor, which proved to be a false copy! after exercising their muscular strength and faster-than-lightning intuition, the two agents were able to lift a screen, exposing the johnson living room. utilizing tuck roll #247, they entered the house undetected and quite silently (ahem ahem). VICTORY IS THEIRS! bwahahaha

both should be promoted."

"event","it is so weird to wake up and be the only one in the room. it's pretty lonely at home, especially since i'm supposed to be working on summer reading and everything. yesterday i hung out with Catherine for a while and that was really fun. i really love my family...they've been super supportive lately and it helps. it's a big transition getting back from camp where i lived with 31 or more people all the time and always had something to do, somewhere to be, rain or shine, and to go back to being stuck inside on a rainy day with nothing really to do but analyze steinbeck. 
i lost pooh bear at camp! ah! for those of you who know who pooh bear is, that's a huge loss and i'm really hoping that someone will find him. bleh. 
church yesterday was nice. i got up and talked to the congregation about Calumet and how nice it is there and how i had a great summer and thanked them for helping to send me (they gave me some fundraiser money). i saw lots of familiar faces but the normal Lutheran church experience is a little duller than the rock-out style of camp church. 

we bow our hearts

oh Lord we cast down our idols

give us clean hands
give us pure hearts
let us not lift our souls to another"

"event","oh wow. this summer was absolutely amazing. i was a CIT at Camp Calumet for those of you who don't know. I was gone ALL summer (8 weeks) and it was quite possibly the most fabulous 8 weeks of my life, especially the last one. i lived with 31 other CITs in 4 tents and we had 2 trainers named Matt (Giggy) and Kristina. Every single person I spent the summer with is an incredible person and I came to love all of them so much. we kinda became a family and being home now is weird without them and getting used to my family at home which is equally amazing. When i came home yesterday i was feeling pretty sad and i opened the door to a big banner that read ""WELCOME HOME CHRISSY"" along with Dylan and Catherine. As i was trying to figure out why my family would make me a banner that said Chrissy when they all call me Christy, out of the kitchen popped Chelsea, Courtney, and Jeremiah. It was the best welcome home crew I could've asked for. But the surprises don't end there. As I was dragging my buttload of stuff up to my room (with much help from friends)what do i see when i get into my room but a NEW COMPUTER!!!? I had some thorough freakout time that involved practically knocking Jeremiah over as i ran downstairs to thank my parents. I still can't believe they got me a new computer especially since I didn't really ask for it. So i have my own computer now and I think the first thing that will be on it is my summer reading which i haven't even begun to write yet. Ooops! well i guess camp does that to you. So i've changed a lot this summer for the better (i hope) and as much as i wished the summer could've lasted forever, i'm glad to be home.

"event","Oy getting ready for the end of the year is like a project and a half. There's a ton of things I'm doing and I love all of them, but honestly sometimes I feel like finals sneak up on me no matter HOW early I start studying! Okay here's some funny stories that made me laugh:
I was sitting in the living room and my dad walks in and so I said, ""Word up Dad?"" and he was like ""What did you say about me twirling my hair?"" oh man then I had to explain to him but I gave up halfway through when all I got was a blank stare. Eh, parents - gotta love 'em. 
Tyler came over for dinner and he's taking me to shoot targets a couple saturdays from now - YES! I'm so excited. Catherine is going to get a babysitter for Dylan and we are going to learn how to fire a gun. So cool. I've never done anything like that and I think I'm going to love it! 
so plans coming up that I'm also excited about: Friday night i'm running to Cold Stone with Billy :) its going to be so much fun - i hope its nice out!
Jeremiah's barbeque on Saturday - YES! I haven't been to a barbeque in ages.
okay so I found this old poem in my creative writing journal. It's kinda dark, but I like the images and how the words fit together. It's inspired from this card I got that is all happy and imagistic, so I turned it upside-down to see what happened. Here goes - 

Day to Night

The sky grows cloudy
As dusty thunder blows
My spirits sink to the depths
Like mud.
The warmth and comfort surrenders
To the darkness and chill.
The waves crash high over the rocks,
Consuming a path before them.
The light of day evaporates,
Veiled with anger and dissatisfaction.
Day turns to Night,
Like a pearl swallowed up by the sea.


so I'm off to do my french debate and study for finals some more! oh by the way here's my schedule for next year - SO excited!!! 
honors chem - wakeland
honors english - witton
TEAMS
honors history - cross

anatomy & physiology - sproul
french 5 honors - cadot
TEAMS
AP history - mcnally

its gonna be a busy but super awesome year! oh and guess what??!?! like 2 weeks until camp!"

"event","wow today was fabulous! half day, first of all, very very cool. then i went to eggspectations with the french club. that was really amusing. it kinda took a while to get the food, but we entertained ourselves by pretending to speak french and such. we talked about wine a lot which was pretty funny. ""not to be like an alcoholic or anything, but i like those wine bottles because they're so pretty."" haha wow. when we got our food chels and me were goofing around and she had to like put her potatoes and ketchup on my plate with my english muffin on it. i totally didnt want a ketchup-py english muffin so i said ""man if you get ketchup on my english muffin, you're toast."" oh my gosh i didnt even realize that was all pun-ish for a split second then chelsea and me just laughed really hard. oh wow.
so after lunch we dropped chelsea and everyone off then my mom and i were stopped at an intersection. note the word stopped. i looked over at her and she's like bent over laughing, putting her coffee cup back and wiping her eye. turns out somehow she had flicked coffee into her eye - how i have no idea. oh gosh my mom makes me crack up sometimes. gotta love parents. oh apparently my dad had some weird thing with his root canal today where he went to the bathroom with this giant blue thing holding his mouth open and his hair all messed up from wearing his hat with wet hair. my parents are so cool. haha no wonder i'm so weird...
chelsea just came over and we went for a ""night run"". who knows how far somewhere around summit and stuff. something around 3 miles i think. lots of fun - i almost kept up with her when we sprinted in but i'm not quite sure she was trying that hard. eh, oh well.  
well off to study for finals and stuff."

"event","so i have this plan to make my live journal cooler. all these people have myspace now which by the way, is SO creepy (all the pictures there are gross and degrading and absolutely disgusting). that website freaks me out but it has stuff like weezer on it and thats awesome! weezer has a new album out and its SO good (although nothing can beat pinkerton). 

so i've become a big country music fan. they played some stuff at galactic bowling and like all the sprinters on the girls outdoor track team listen to country (aka whitney & andrea) so therefore i love it. 

yesterday was good. here's what i did.
-taught sunday school. last week! :( next week is this special games day for all the kids. it should be really fun. teaching the kindergarten class with catherine has been fantastic, frustrating, funny, and frantic. next year i think i'll be a substitute or help out or something. i love little kids!
-church! YES! my dad had a really really good sermon and there was this special praying time at the end which i love. you go up and say your name and something you're having trouble with and the pastor prays for you. i love it especially when its my dad. :D
-went to macworth with my mom! and i got to drive! it was SO gorgeous out there. i love nature. it really makes you feel all warm and tingly inside like nothing else can. being out there made me feel...small but content. so happy to be alive and be part of all this. so we walked around the island and talked for a while and enjoyed the sunshine.
-watched moulin rouge in the basement. i adore that movie. ""one day i'll fly away/leave all this to yesterday/why live life from dream to dream/and dread the day/when dreaming ends""
-babysat for Caitlyn and Teddy at night. they are the two most adorable kids (besides dylan) that i have ever met. i love them so much and they are incredible to babysit for. its like having cousins to take care of or something. apparently they are having a tick problem in their yard or something. so anna louise had to check to make sure the front door was locked and caitlyn goes ""she locked the door to make sure the ticks won't come in."" she's so adorable.

today is going to be a great day! already i found out i'm getting cold stone creamery ice cream tonight! that makes everything awesome...haha

i just saw star wars again! haha yeah definately made me cry...again. gosh i'm such a freak. its all my dad's fault for raising me to be a trekkie/star wars loser. haha ohhh well i love it so i guess thats okay, right?

earlier today i babysat for Ava for like a long time and made $33! yes! now i can buy stuff...who knows what. i'm gonna go see star wars again tomorrow - yesssss. dude i think newlyweds is on so i'm gonna gooo"

billy called me from the airport too!! yaaay! its sad that he's leaving for a few days, but he'll be back soon and everything will be happy again. :D

STAR WARS COMES OUT TOMORROW! SO stoked! i'm going at like 7 tomorrow after my track meet where i'll hopefully high jump 4'8"" and run like a 1:12 400! that'd be really really exciting! i jumped 4'6"" at the last meet and i was SO excited because thats like my best from indoor and my coach today was like ""jumping 4'8"" tomorrow?"" i was like uhhhh maybe. i'll try my best! so i rediscovered this song and i wanted to put some of it in my profile cuz its like my life or something like that. 

Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise...It's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love.


yeah so that kinda reminded me of me and maybe its cuz Bill called me ""Miss Independent"" when i was gonna try to find my own way to the library. i guess i just dont like relying on people all the time, because i like to do things on my own. but clearly i fell in love so i have to work on not being miss independent all the time. hey, but i can still be independent sometimes and with certain things, right?"

"event","blah. rain today. that makes it a lazy day, and i'm supposed to be working on my project for history. i have like, no motivation to make posters and figure out what i'm gonna say about Davy Crockett. Good thing it only has to be 5 minutes. i havent really had that much motivation to work lately and i think its because i dont feel pressure to work until the very end. i think it really has to do a lot with the fact that my parents made me quit karate. i have little drive to succeed in school right now, except maybe in biology. history is so boring. i'm so used to be super busy all the time, and i love being super busy. now that i dont have karate, i'm not super busy, and i don't feel like doing ANYTHING anymore. i think part of my personality thrives on being busy, on always having something constructive to do, and when i don't, i become useless. nothing is important anymore. its hard to explain i guess...
so today i went shopping for the first time in forever! i got lots of new summer clothes for camp - yes, specifically for camp. camp clothes that were cheap and will be 100% filthy by the end of the summer from Calumet. so they're cute and i like the way they fit because none of them are really tight which is a good thing for camp. oh, and none of them cost more than $10. So i got a pair of shorts, one short sleeve shirt and 3 tank tops for $45. woo! congrats to me and my bargain hunting skills.
i'm sleepy. and i'd better go eat dinner and work on this horrid project...."

i went to the boys track meet today. wicked fun! umm i dont think they came in first but adam and bill and john and jack all did well. actually all the boys did well. jack threw something crazy for jav like 120 feet and john threw really well it was like SO far across the field and it was like 113 or something which is like a PR for him. and then bill ran a really fast 100 and adam ran a really fast 200 and we all joked around. adam cracked off like half a dozen totally crude jokes today. i told him he was way over his limit of like 3...a day. he's silly. then bill and i were really silly during the car ride home and i pretended to be ghetto :P C UNIT! hehehe
so off to homework and bed! it never ends...."

okay so thats like the only part that ever gets stuck in my head. drives me crazy. oh well haha!
so life has been really good and crazy today. my quad is pulled still from friday but it feels a little better after running like 3 miles slowly on it today. i'm hoping it'll be fine for wednesday's meet.
so mr. tucker dumped like half a ton of work on us today and expected us to be ready to take a quiz he said we'd have wednesday TODAY in like 25 minutes. gotta love teachers. and then i have my project on davy crockett due monday but thats not that hard because its like a 5-10 minute presentation. shouldnt be too bad.
bio goes SO FAST! ah!
okay so guess who i talked to online today? my friend Nick from camp! i swear that kid makes me laugh SO SO hard. he's like the funniest person i know. he was going on and on about getting a date with this girl because he watched a chick flick and cried. DaNgErOuSdOnUt79: wat can i say im becomin emo

and it was so much fun. we got ice cream and saw a good movie about hitchhiking or something. it was funny but i almost fell asleep cuz i was so tired. hehe bill like poked me to wake me up. :P i'm so silly
GUESS WHAT TODAY IS?!?! dylan's birthday - one year old. he's so big, i can't believe it. he's so amazing and he's growing up so fast and i love him so much - AH! hehehe well i gotta go get ready for festivities.

"event","today was in a word: fabulous! this morning i woke up early to help get dylan and catherine off to school and daycare, then went back to bed for 2 lovely hours. I then got up and ready for track, which was nice and easy. Yesterday we had a speed workout (7 200s) and tomorrow is another one (5 500s ) <<owch 
so track is super fun and we're all into country music which is something new for me, but i kinda like it now. i guess a mixture of catherine wandering around singing country lyrics and the track girls blasting it in the car to and from fitzy just gets me into it, huh?
so after track courtney and me and martha got ice cream and then courtney and i walked EVERYWHERE and ended up at Drew's for a little bit. that was cool. i like his house. its big. annnnyways then i came home and went grocery shopping with catherine and dylan and we saw mikey and said hi to him. i swear his hair gets cooler every time i see him - and wider. SO awesome! haha
after that i basically hung out for a while and then drove up to L.L.Beans with my dad. Oh gosh, scariest thing ever going like 70 mph on the highway. Wicked scary but i only made my dad freakout once, and that wasn't even on the highway. hehehe People drive WAY TOO FAST! seriously people were going like 80 or something...
so at Beans we found the sleeper sofa that my dad wanted to get for the basement for only $300! i was SO excited!! it was supposed to be like $600 but we got it half off - SO AMAZING! i can't wait to have the basement all set up and cool and fun to be down there. wicked stoked! :D
Courtney came over later on tonight which was awesome cuz we haven't hung out outside of school and track in forever. so we painted some in the Keep and moved the seats of the car and took our first joy ride...haha. juuuuuuuuuuuust kidding. we also looked at pictures and stuff and it made me miss Bill, who is away in Pennsylvania for a couple days. Aww i miss him. He'll be home like tomorrow night i think. good.

oh well. life goes on. so i have like 3 french quizzes or tests this week. madame cadot is crazy. so i have a french test tomorrow on future and tuesday on geography in france, which is going to suck cuz i never feel like studying for it cuz there's too much to learn and its mega-boring. in bio last week i did good on the test though, so hopefully i'll still have a decent grade in that class. i'm excited for report cards to come out and for the end of the year to come so i'll get my money. i also have to start thinking about camp which is kinda sad cuz i'll be gone all summer and miss everyone. i have to buy like an entire new wardrobe of ""camp clothes"" that will be basically destroyed, stained, and ripped by the end of 8 weeks. 
so my parents randomely think i'm gonna have sex in the basement once we get it set up, which is why they're dragging their feet about it. all i want is a place to hang out with my friends, and they suddenly think i'm gonna end up pregnant. good to know they trust me so much...

why am i updating this early in the morning? ummm good question. its before school and i felt that i needed to tell everyone how track is going. i've switched to being a 400 runner and i didnt die at the last speed workout, i actually did a lot better than i expected. maybe i've found my race. so today is another speed workout and i'm wicked psyched. i'm also gonna get to high jump once the mat dries out and so hopefully we'll have lovely hot weather for a while. AND coach myatt is gonna teach me how to long jump! YAAY! so i'm wicked psyched about track and i just love it! :)

"event","so life is good, and i've finally come around and realized that. i've kinda been in a slump and feeling a little down for the past week, but you know, things may be messed up sometimes but life in general is still good. i'm 16, i'm in love, i have friends (yes i do :P), and even though sometimes i complain about it, i'm pretty darn lucky to live in the United States. I guess i kinda decided that complaining and dwelling on all the depressing stuff really  just isnt a good way to spend my time. there's a lot i have to be happy about and thankful for. Maybe this all came about because of Easter and outdoor track starting this week...haha who knows. running gets endorphins flowing which make you happy. maybe thats the only reason. either way, i'm happy.
so what have i been up to? EVERYTHING. AND I LOVE IT. haha. so as i already said outdoor track started this week. sooo much fun. Alice decided she was gonna run track which is awesome and i'm so psyched! we're gonna be running buddies! outdoor is so much fun, and i think i like it because its a lot more relaxed than indoor. maybe because of the Expo. yeah i think thats it. so i'm gonna do high jump again and try long jump hopefully. i'm wicked excited. 
on wednesdays they have this cool writing class at deering run by these local authors in the portland area. its really cool and if anyone who reads this is interested in creative writing or poetry, you should totally come. its like 2:30-4 on wednesdays for like the next month or something. i really like it because i never get to just write stuff for me. its always for class or for something but now i can actually write what i want to. so thats really really nice. 
this weekend is CRAZY for me. tonight my plans were cancelled, which was actually okay because i just stayed home and was exhausted anyways. haha, so i watched some tv with the family and ate ice cream and just lazed about procrastinating about homework. UH-OH. i'll pay for that later. so tomorrow i'm going to a Sunday School teachers meeting early in the morning and then going up to Bates to watch the OM competition! yaaay! i'm excited to see Bill and Lindsey and all of their little performance thingy. then i'm coming home to actually do my homework before i go see Working at 7:30 at Deering. I'm so pumped for that! i saw the preview thing today during 4th block and it looks SOOOO good! anyways Sunday I am going to Jeremiah's bday party for a little bit and then off to McAuley to work at some concert band thingy with two of the coolest guys on the planet: Bill and Mike. YAAAY! Then i'm going straight to youth group until like 8:30! woo! great day i'm excited for it!

At like 4 Bill came over and we decorated Easter eggs and ate yummy fish for dinner. my parents totally embarrassed me and i kept dropping things and spilling on myself, but it was definately pretty funny. then bill catherine and i went to Libs (i broke Lent...oops!) and the ice cream was amazing. then we took Bill home and i shaved Catherine's legs like last year when she was pregnant. so i continued two traditions today - decorating eggs and shaving my sisters legs? hahaha i'm so crazy.
i am the shaving queen and captain sex apparently. dont ask.
so i'm gonna go watch The Army of Darkness on SciFi channel. my dad and i were watching it...fake skeletons, the same guy as from Bristo- County Junior, pretend costumes and such, you know, the whole deal. i like it. so i'm gonna go now...."

"event","i just gotta start off and say that Dylan is getting SO big! he's almost walking now and he's got 8 little teeth and he's trying to say words like ball - ""bah!"" bath - ""bah!"" grandpa - ""gah pa"" grandma - ""gammah"" and christy - ""crah"" errrr yeah not so sure about the last one haha. he's working on it. but he's definately the cutest little baby ever and i like having a little bit of extra time to actually be with my nephew. playing with little kids is definately the best way to lift your spirits, i recommend it anytime.
well outdoor starts next week! yaay! its conditioning week, which is pretty painful sometimes but i like it. i havent run in forever, i bet i'm so out of shape. eh well we have like a month before our first meet. i'm really excited because Mr. Myatt is our high jump coach so i might actually improve in high jumping. maybe i'll even be able to score some points for Deering! that'd feel good. hehe
so things have been busy. (what else is new, they always are) i've been everywhere at once. French Club had a bake sale which was very successful! Chels, Emily, and I were so excited. We might not be able to go Paris senior year though, we might have to go to Quebec again or Montreal or something, just because no teachers will bring us to Paris. I guess its pretty expensive to go overseas anyways. 
okay so i'm pretty much exhausted right now. i'm sick and my head kinda feels twice its normal size haha. so i had school and then church where i sang even though my voice probably didnt sound all that pretty (oh well). after that it was straight to the bake sale and then some big huge mixup with piano and i finally got there and played for like 45 minutes or an hour or something. then back home to watch Baby Einstein with Dylan and Catherine before trying to sleep for oh, about 15 minutes before i got woken up for dinner. :P then i went to church again after much contemplation and ended up acolyting. so i'm pretty exhausted but i got to carry the candle out and entinguish candles and stuff. 
Good Friday, for those of you who don't know, is the day that Jesus was crucified and died. Why its called good? John-Mark asked me that today. Kinda made me think. I think its because without Jesus dying for us, we'd still be responsible for our sins so in a way, His death was good, even though it was sad. I think it used to be called Black Friday or something. Not sure though.

I had the hardest bio test of my life yesterday and i think i did badly on it. bah, oh well. i was in a crappy mood then i went out and it made everything better. hehehe :) oh yeah i also saw Robots yesterday. Good movie! hehe very funny. you can tell its Robin Williams behind that robot...he did this whole britney spears thing and it made me laugh SO hard.
so i havent really done anything today. i slept until like 11:15. then i made pancakes and gave dylan a bath and played with him and catherine and such. i'm thinking of doing homework later on today because i have to read an entire chapter for history! rawrrrr"

"event","so today has been relaxing so far. I went to karate which was a lot of fun...we did many kicks and i helped out the little kids doing Universal Two (hehe). then i came home and Chelsea and i went for a run, probably like 2-3 miles, which, by the way, i am SO out of shape. (i was tired). so we're going to do one timed mile tomorrow and then run the boulevard! hopefully, if i don't die. definately not twice though. not yet. maybe next weekend. ;) then we came back here and ate and played russian bank and concentration and spit. lots of fun. halfway through russian bank Chelsea's like ""Wanna go for another run? I kinda wanna run again."" and i was like ""Do you really want to?"" and she's like ""No. Maybe. Kinda."" haha i'm definately already sore and done with running for now. i hadn't run in like 2-3 weeks since indoor ended.
so i drove yesterday. scariest thing ever. i did not relax for an hour and a half. there's so much to pay attention to, i have NO idea how anyone can talk and drive at the same time, or look out the window, or anything. Mike Dow is so cool thought. He's my instructor, and he kept me from colliding with parked cars! lol i'm such an incredibly bad driver...haha well hopefully i get better!
so today is kinda just a chill out day. maybe i'll watch LOTR later or something. Something fun. Bill's gone to South Carolina for yesterday and today so sadly my date tonight was canceled. awwww...so i'll be at home doing homework and watching a movie. that'll probably be good for me anyways, right? 
so college is way too expensive. Brown and Tufts would cost me a quarter of a million dollars to just go to undergraduate school, nevermind medical school. so i guess i'm gonna start looking at state universities or cheaper schools, then maybe i can go to Tufts or Brown for Medical school. yeah i'm probably not smart enough to get into those schools anyways. lol plus i'd be with a whole bunch of stuck up rich people which probably wouldn't be that much fun. i think college is going to rock wherever i go because its freedom and it seems really exciting to be out on your own learning about things you're actually interested in. speaking of which, biology with dr. sproul is like the coolest class ever! its hard but its soooo interesting and so much fun! highlight of my day!
i babysat last night and made money and that money with my grades money means i only have like $80 left out of my drivers ed tuition to pay. which is good, cuz i hate taking money out of the bank. anyways i'm gonna stop boring you all and go wash the smelly dog."

Jon and Lexie are really cute and we watched part of the Mask of Zorro- AHH Antonio Bandares! we also hung out in the hot tub for a while and played Never Ever Have I Ever. pretty interesting game. I lost. anyways, it was fun.
Dylan just tried to take over the computer. silly goose. Teddy and him are playing here for a while. So cute. Tomorrow Lindsey and me and potentially Sarah are doing Mommy's Afternoon Off from 1-4 at the church with like 6 kids I think. Awwww, fun. 
So I went college shopping this vacation. I saw Brown and Tufts and both are pretty amazing. Brown has a great campus and everyone there seems so excited, and i really really wanna go there but the chances of me getting in are SO slim. Tufts was nice too, a lot more relaxed and down to earth, which i guess is okay. Boston confuses me. They have an awesome indoor track though...i think i fell in love with it. Yeah.
On my trip i also got to see Dana and Maggie and Ryann! AWWW i love them (camp buds). It was so good to see them and visit for a couple hours. I kinda wish i could live in Medfield, or like...bring all of them up here. We have such a great time together. i hope they can come visit me at camp this summer. SPEAKING of camp this summer, Calumet hasn't told me whether I was accepted or not to be a CIT at camp this summer yet. They said February and guess what? It's like almost the end of February. Grrrrrr
GUESS WHAT? i get to see Bill tonight and I haven't hung out with him in FOREVER because we were supposed to go to track championships on Monday together then it snowed and he couldn't go. Then we were supposed to hang out Wednesday night when i got back from my trip but something happened with his answering machine and my computer was busted and we just never got to figure it out. so tonight i get to see my sweetie! yaaaay! i think we're going to have to watch that japanese movie thing that was made by the same people as Spirited Away- yeah!

Let's see, in track at southwesterns i got a PR of 33.5! very exciting! chelsea did amazing at southwesterns which brings me to why i really updated this journal, which is because chelsea forced me too. and i'm typing really fast to irritate her because she cant type as fast as me.  :P juuuuust kidding! so the nice thing about having easier classes is that i get to catch up with people i've missed seeing, aka Andrew, Lindsey, Chelsea, Alex, and maybe JON if he'd ever be online! i've got a ton of energy now and chelsea and me made up cool new last names because we were jealous of the french guy Renzo Piano. he's got a last name of an instrument and that made us jealous so we are now Christy Clarinet and Chelsea Cello. I personally like Chelsea's better because it rhymes with Jello and sounds cooler. :P 
Valentine's Day was great this year. I got to hang out with my sweetie for most of the afternoon into evening. we went to the Olive Garden and i totally pigged out. it was yummy! and i thought the waitress was gonna offer us wine and it made me laugh so i could barely order my dinner and i think Bill thought i was on drugs or something. hehe. then we went back to his house and watched Friday Night Lights and did presents and hugs and the whole Valentine's Day thing. it was a great day...
me and Linz had a ""tee hee"" contest today and we're thinking of doing some big cool babysitting thing in a couple weeks for some families we babysit for. Totally fun and i'm stoked!

Bored by small talk, you refuse to participate in boring conversations.

You are open minded. A visionary. You understand the world and may change it.  

yaaay i dont think it came out all cool looking like hers, but 5 is my number apparently. :D  kinda sounds like me...independent and everything. i dont know about the other stuff. so what have i been up to lately? well not that much, track is going well. i did high jump for the first time this year and my highest is 4'6"" as of Saturday. Chelsea's my hero because she's been helping me with it and she's sooo good and also wicked fast. My parents have been driving me up the wall, but thats not really anything new.

the election drove me absolutely crazy and is completely depressing. After four more years with Bush, there's not gonna be a country left to live on. Half the United States will be serving in Iraq and all of our money will be over there for people who don't even want us there. Yeah, i hate Bush. He doesn't know how to run a country at all. So i think i'll be moving to Canada as soon as I turn 18, unless they ban us from moving there without a legitimate reason, which they're talking about doing. funfun. so i've been pretty depressed since Wednesday and I think i probably will be a little depressed for the next four years as our country continues down this spiral of doom. 
on a happier note, tomorrow is my birthday! WEEE! i'm excited! Sweet Sixteen. My parents arent letting me know anything which, i gotta say, is really annoying because I wanted to pick out the cake and I'd kinda like to know how we're getting to the movie theater tomorrow for my party. Oh well, I guess they havent learned how in-control I like to be. I'm having a lot of people over even though like most people can only come for like one quarter of my party, but oh well. We're gonna play ultimate frisbee and soccer and football and fun stuff like that down at Lyseth if its not rainy and cold. Then we're coming back here for pizza and ice cream cake and presents and hanging out. Then we get to go to see the Incredibles because it looks really funny. 
I'm soooo tired lately and I think its because i've been doing so much. Also I went to a concert last night, which was by the way, absolutely incredible!!! Mark Schultz is definately the best musical artist EVER. Avalon was really great too- Christian music, for those of you who have no idea who i'm talking about. They're good bands and I highly enjoyed it.
I also made my confirmation this past Sunday and felt very loved because a lot of people came to see me. Thanks to Bill, Adam, John, Lindsey, and Jon especially for coming- it meant a lot to me. I felt very supported!
anyways its off to clean for tomorrow and everything!!!"

can you tell i'm mega excited? yeah, i am...SO excited! i think i'm gonna pass out and die when Bill picks me up on Saturday which will be a shame because that'll mean he will have to carry me out to the car and to the resterant, etc. 

annnnyways, the past week has been amazing. Spirit Week was so much fun! okay, lets recap!
Monday- 60's Day..um worst day costume wise. i wore like a tye dye shirt and beads and called myself a hippie

Tuesday- Rock Star Day  whoever came up with that idea is definately my hero! i was michael jackson, got so many random comments. i swear everyone at deering was my friend that day. so many people came up to talk to me and some pretty creepy guys were talking to me too. karin can attest to that- she was with me when one of them attacked. ha ha ha so yeah i looked a lot like him and i got to listen to Thriller all day and finally be WARM inside Bill's marching band jacket! :) i like being warm

Wednesday- Superhero Day  umm yeah i was RepairMAN MAN MAN MAN  from All That. great show. It was fun- so many people said they almost dressed up as that and then they didnt. Good. I'm glad they didnt. I did. haha. Some people were the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which made my day and they all became my heroes. Except they didn't have a Leonardo, which made me sad.

Thursday(Today)- Pajama Day/Costume Day  i was a cheerleader. i wore a very short skirt, high heels, and a tight shirt. I felt like a skank. ehh it happens. i was  big ditz all day and it kept bugging Courtney in english- haha. it was fun, but the heels definately hurt my feet and i kinda wish i'd worn pajamas. ehh oh well

Friday(Tomorrow)- Purple and White Day  wearing LOADS of purple and white, um plus there's a pep rally which is SO cool and i didnt know that until english today and it made my day! :) i like pep rallies! they're awesome! so yeah, tomorrow is going to rock! Homecoming Game at night, then Saturday- HOMECOMING!!!! nothing can ruin the next two days, they're going to be the best two days of my life!


:)       :)           :)            :)           :)"

"event","WHEW i finally get about a 20 minute break! i just came from piano and i am playing the greatest song EVER- Fantasie by Mozart! YESSS i've been waiting to play that for years and i'm so excited that i'm finally ready for it! i have TONS of homework lately. mr. blouin is a great teacher and all, but i've got two classes with him which means loads of work- especially writing. oh well, at least i will come out of this semester being crazy good at writing
my biggest excitement for the weekend was running the boulevard with chelsea TWICE on Sunday! it was very amusing and we definately got a huge runner's high at the end cuz i definately felt like i was flying as we sprinted the last 1/4 mile. So 7.4 miles makes me feel very in shape, and boosts my self-esteem about running like WOAH! then we went to bill's cuz i was cat sitting and ate lots of food to burn off the 1600 calories we burned. then we watched Fareheit 9/11 and went to bed at Chelsea's house. I cant understand why anyone would vote for Bush by the way, he's such a liar. honestly people! and our country is in ruins with him in office! ahh im so sick of politics. i'm really not even a big fan of Kerry i'd rather have anyone else in office than Bush because he's destroying our country
i watched Michael Jacksons' music video Thriller and it made me laugh SO hard and i'm determined to learn the dance now because it makes Dylan crack up!
well its off to karate and then more homework! wee"

"event","Well considering last time I didn't really write about anything important, here's my real update.
Dylan is adorable and I am obsessed with him. He gets cuter and cuter every day. I can make him laugh like all the time now and he's so much fun to play with. He has a mohawk and a mullet and he's just the sweetest little baby. I'm very child-oriented these days because I have been babysitting almost non-stop it seems. I babysat last night and this evening as well, plus I do Sunday School every Sunday. Speaking of which, I have to plan that for tomorrow. It's working okay because of course I like kids. They're easier to get along with.
Another thing I've been doing a lot of is running. Every day in gym- Ko is awesome! We've also played soccer and football which is awesome. Speaking of football, I am sooo obsessed. Dylan's gonna have to come to one of the Saturday day games sometime in his super cute football clothes! hehe 
My life is amazing and this fall has gone pretty well so far. I went apple picking today with Bill which was SO much fun and just made me think about how much I love fall. I mean, between football, the leaves being all pretty, pumpkins and apples, and Halloween plus my birthday, it ends up being a pretty awesome season. I'm really excited because this year for my birthday its Sweet Sixteen and I've got a rockin party planned! I watched part of Finding Nemo tonight with Anya and Zoe and Dakota, and it was SO great because I forgot all about the turtles who are like ""totally"" and ""sweet"" and ""duuude"" like all the time. it made me laugh so hard and I think i scared Dakota...hehe oh well
okay i'm done. i'm tired and i need sleeep like woah."

"event","hey all i'm at martha's hanging out listening to Billy Joel cuz he's really really cool! haha i just did this weird random survey in her profile. i'm gonna put it in next time i update if i remember and stuff. 

yeah life is good. i went to popham beach this past sunday and it was SO much fun. i went with bill and mike and robbie! robbie is SO hilarious- he talked the whole time! haha and bill and i had a weird cheek poofing contest, it was pretty amusing. we all played volleyball and almost got swept away by the current and walked out to the island. it was soooooooooo much fun. we should do it again next year!

lets see, yesterday i was at lindsey's like all day and we hung out with andrew and his friend mike for a while. andrew is really cool and i havent hung out with him in forever so it was good to see him again and catch up. i think we should hang out more often this year than last year because i was a loser last year and evil after we broke up. so, we'll be friends again and hang out and stuffff sometimes. lindsey's wicked funny too. we watched johnny on the tv and played Russian Bank which Chelsea taught me when she slept over on monday night! ahh by the way i love her too! she's so funny, we had a great time monday/tuesday. we were supposed to go to sleep then we went upstairs and ate food and then pretended to go to sleep again. we watched spirited away again too which was really fun and guess what? we didnt consume ANY nutella at all which is like a miracle. hehehe

right so martha wants the computer back again, but i've had a really great summer and i'm hoping that these last 3 days will be great! i've got lots of plans which should make going back to school a lot easier! right so i'll update again probably later so i can put those question things in my journal too!"

"event","hi! i went away for the beginning of this week to my grandma's and it was an absolute blast! we played this really really fun game called Phase 10 which my grandma won because she had uncanny luck at it. and we played really late at night which was highly amusing because we were all so tired and couldnt really function all that well. i want to buy that game now and play with all my friends because its seriously so funny. we also went shopping at the outlets and got some good deals. i was hoping to get either some black pants or some courderoy, but it didnt happen cuz none of them fit me length-wise. yeah sometimes it stinks being tall. 

right so i got home safe and everything. lots of car riding time though. dylan was good though in the car. i went to the hanson concert sunday night and it was absolutely fabulous! i know you all think im a loser cuz i love hanson, but they are seriously a great group. i like how they like dont have to swear and be vulgar, yet they still have such great music. mmmm too bad taylor hanson is married. but catherine and i saw his baby, which was exciting. i wish i had taylor hanson's baby. pssh no fair. i cant believe he married a groupie. anyways...

dylan got his pictures taken professionally today. he's such a cutie! but our pictures from home are so much cuter! catherine got some reprints which is great because now i can make a collage and stuff for my room. 

in case you missed my story from online, last night was definately eventful as far as the christy-craziness area. i ran upstairs to get my calendar to make plans with lindsey, and somehow i ran into the wall on my way around the corner and hit my hip really hard. my dad was in bed so i stumbled down the hallway clutching my hip and whispering ""ow, ow, ow, ow"". then i fell in front of catherine's open door and started laughing really hard. i laughed so hard that my nose wiggled, which, if you know me, doesnt really happen too often. i think the only people who have seen it are catherine and courtney. its really rather entertaining. i kinda wish it would happen more often because apparently its pretty hilarious to see. always makes catherine laugh really hard... so anyways then i pointed to my nose to tell her that it was wiggling which she didnt understand so she just gave me a weird look. yeah so i finally could talk to tell her what happened and we both laughed really hard for a while. then later on like maybe 45 minutes later i went upstairs again and lost my balance a few steps from the top. so i went sprawling out onto the landing and burst out laughing again (quietly, of course). So that definately made me laugh really hard again, but not hard enough for my nose to wiggle again. what a shame. anyways i thought the entire world might want to know that i'm crazy and run into walls and doors and stuff periodically. also that my nose wiggles if i laugh really hard. so, i expect all of you to try to make me laugh hard enough to see that! :P

bill and mike and adam and me went on a bike ride today. i kinda felt like a little kid again and it brought back a lot of memories. we played Life and hung out at adam's for a while cuz he takes like forever to get ready. oh yeah- bill and mike and me definately went to get ice cream while adam was in the shower because he takes longer showers than like my whole family combined. haha its okay we still love him. so today was super fun! everything's just kinda working for me, and its really great!

this is a very long entry. apparently i am expected to finish my summer reading this week so i've got some things to do this evening."

Its Caitlyn and Teddy, and they are like 3 and 8 months. Caitlyn's been my shadow all week at VBS and she's so cute! seriously, these kids are awesome. and obviously dylan isnt an ugly baby either. he's so good. :) so today will be fun- hopefully adam will be amused. lol he seems to like dylan.  

yeah so my weekend is wicked busy so i probably wont be able to update until like sunday night or monday which is good because its pathetic that i update this often. lindsey- i loved your journal entry. made me feel special even tho jon and i ate all the ice cream without you. :P  Chelsea congrats to you for joining MCU team! yaay for soccer. jon, congrats again for being an EMT. bill, congrats for surviving week one of football preseason. and lindsey....ummm congrats for living? congrats for surviving through three weeks of work with little kids who pinch you and call you fat?? somethin like that.

"event","yeah i'm just sitting her bummin around eating nutella and cleaning this afternoon. there's gonna be some renovations made to my house and hopefully within the next year the basement will be redesigned enough that the Keep will be its own room and have its own entrance and be super cool! i would be so excited! i mean, how many teenagers have their own hang out room to be with their friends apart from their bedroom? yeah, and its all because i hang out with guys. lol, cuz they're definately not allowed in my room (although some of them go in anyways). this saturday my mom and i are going yard-sale-ing to find a cheap couch for the basement so we dont have to lay on the futon all the time because its SO not comfortable. i'm also looking into buying a TV with a built in DVD player for fairly cheap and then we can watch movies downstairs if the living room is taken up. the wall being put up and being decorated by me and Chelsea and Courtney will probably have to wait for this fall or next spring. probably next year. but still, i'm really excited. i love it down there!

i would just like to make it known, on the record, that i am SO annoyed by this years summer reading. its ridiculous and confusing and i really really dont like the book. its taking me forever to finish writing about because i'm so sick of it and i'm procrastinating. 

yeah so i have to get back to cleaning and stuff because we're having our annual building inspection this afternoon for the parsonage. so apparently the house has to be like..spotless. i'm in charge of vacuuming and some other things so i've gotta go get to it.

yaay none of you has any idea what i'm talking about!! woo, thats fun. after karate i ate a healthy dinner and then went off to the church for like an hour and half and played piano. loads of fun. i was in the sanctuary by myself playing ""I swear"" and singing along with it. lol it echoed. funnnnnny. then daddy and i went grocery shopping while i was in my pjs. hmmm- riiiight

my mom just said alien vs. predator did really well in the theaters. aww it was a great movie! catherine didnt like it- what a chicken noodle head. it was very very good considering i really didnt expect to like it at all. right so i'm off to eat hopefully healthy lunch like veggies and stuff but watch me get distracted by something in the fridge. thou shalt not eat junk food during preseason!"

yeah chelsea, by the way, is my hero. i hung out with her yesterday. we played football lol it was funny. these crazy guys who were drinking on their front steps tried to talk to us about football and get us to play with them, but we're just like ""uhhh, no"" and walked on. haha i love her though. we made yummy cookies and omg i forgot there was this weird lady/man (we're not sure) in Rite Aid and she/he was like ""i'm all set i just really need to go to the bathroom."" and then the cashier was evil because i tried to not laugh and it came out as like a muffled snort which sounded really gross. but then the lady at the register was evil and made fun of me for saying i liked the song on the radio and chelsea and i decided we really dont like Rite Aid anymore. so it was a great afternoon and lots of fun
Matt and Heather got married yesterday and I realized that i'm not going to be able to make it through my wedding vows. i'm gonna say like one word and start crying and not be able to talk. watching matt and heather, i was crying, so that gives you an idea how emotional weddings are. i used to get confused as to why people cried, but now that i'm older, i understand why. its like...emotionally too adorable and happy and you just have to cry or you'll burst. yeah that sounds weird but..its hard to describe
preseason started for football and cross country and soccer and everything, and it's weird because a lot of my friends are busy being active and i kinda feel like a slug. so i've been getting up early and running in the mornings and then going to VBS. OH YEAH- VBS!!! great times. all the little kiddos are so cute. i get the youngest group. Mrs. Dyer's twins- Kelly and Rachael are in my group and so is this wicked cute little girl named Caitlyn who I just babysat for. they're all so adorable and so much fun to play with. i kinda wish i could just spend my life playing with kids but i guess it'd probably get old and i'd get sick of it. i dont really want kids of my own- i just like taking care of kids sometimes, and VBS is great cuz there's lots of them. i wish more people called me to babysit. i hope i can babysit for Caitlyn and Teddy again. maybe Emma and Cailyn's mom will call me too. or maybe Mrs. Dyer and her husband will finally decide to go out and have a babysitter. I gave them my number last year, and she told me today that she still has it, but the girls have never had a babysitter before. can you believe that? crazy! i wish i had that much free time lol. 
right so sorry about the long entry but i'll probably update in another couple days. i'm gonna go watch Spirited Away which i borrowed from Chels. I've done so much stuff i cant even begin to fully update. basically my summer's been awesome so far. except for summer reading, which totally sucks but i'm working at it. karate has been going well. i've been a slacker at piano though, but i did pick up guitar. Life is good- i've got all my issues sorted out and working towards my goals. yaaay!"

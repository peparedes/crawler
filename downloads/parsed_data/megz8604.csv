I know all your mouths are agape at the shock because it seems very unlike me. However, I am really excited. My sorority is called Sigma Sigma Sigma. They are a lot of fun. I met a lot of the girls through my friend Lyndsey, who is recruitment director for the sorority, and they all seem to love me! They dropped off my bid card (formal invite to join the sorority) on Wednesday night and decorated my car with window chalk. It looks awesome, of course!! I'm so happy and excited!!"

"event","Ok, I know that no one really likes those updates that are just what people's days are like, but this is about New Year's Eve. So, I think that y'all can let it slide. I had a great time on New Year's. We went to one of Ian's friend's, Mel, house. It was just his friends from high school. But since I adore them all, it was wonderful. There was singing of Build Me Up, Buttercup at the top of our voices, hookah smoking, strawberry cigars, etc. A hilarious turn of events was when the puppy spilled my daquiri all over me. (Hopefully, Ian remembered to take care of that before he left.) But I did not care all that much. There was, also, drunken DDR. Now, I know you are all jealous. Downside, Mel's younger brother's friends were there. All the guys wore girls' jeans. One of the had a pair of jeans that I own, only his were a smaller size than mine. Damn scenen kids. That's all. Love y'all."

"event","Rejoice everyone, for I have posted. This has been a very uneventful break so far, but no complaints. I have slept as if I thought I would never be able to sleep again. It is wonderful. I have also discovered that I am at my warmest and happiest when in the bathtub. This may result in me being in the tub up to twice a day during this break, but no promises. My first day back I went to a play with Crosby, where I ran into Jamie Patton, Jodi Dyke, and Sam Williams. Needless to say they rocked my world profously.(I don't know how to spell that last word, so I apologize.) The next actual happening was when I went shopping with Brad, Steph, and their son Mason (whom I named, thank you very much). Very fun, I hadn't seen Steph in a long time and Mason is a complete doll. Then, I bought train tickets and went to IHOP with Ian yesterday. That, too, was lovely. So far so good I'd say. (Wow, I need to learn how to punctuate, but it is so very confusing.) Yeah, my life is boring, but what can you do. Nothing, so give up now!! That's all. Love y'all."

"event","Alright so there are a few of you who have yet to get facebook. And don't lie and say you got it but just haven't had time to add friends. Because I have searched for y'all. And you aren't on there. Those people are as follows: Jodi Dyke, Jamie Patton, Tiffany Long, Becki Conner, Marlaina Dyke, and Mitchell Conner. Yes, I'm aware that only two of the aforementioned have livejournal. And what you all are probably wondering is who the hell is Mitchell Conner. (My cousin on my mom's side for those of you who really are wondering.) But this is beside the point. I want Jodi and Jamie to get facebook so that I can write random stupid comments on their pages. It will make me smile and fill up the time in the language lab where I am supposed to be studying Spanish, but there is no way in hell that I'm going to be doing that. Please, I beg of you, get facebook before my face explodes. And it will. You can be sure of that. Or get myspace. Or better still get both. And don't listen to Audrey if she tells you that Myspace blows. She is wrong. She's just angry because she is unaware of how to properly use it. Yeah, Audrey, I went there. Ok, well that was my entire rant on that. So what else. Oh yeah, I skipped mythology again today. In my defense right now we are going over the Iliad, and I know everything in that book. Ergo, I don't need to sit there and have it told to me, when I already know what's going to happen. At least this is the excuse that I tell myself when I decide that sleeping is much more inviting than going to that class. By the way, just another reminder that Ian's 21st birthday party is October 22nd. This is a Saturday, and this party is open to all. On the menu are White Castle burgers, Little Caesar's Crazy Bread, and Ice Cream Cake. All of these fine eats will be prepared at home by yours truly. That's right I have the recipe for Sliders and Crazy Bread. It would be awesomely awesome (to use an Audreyism) if y'all could come. Alright, that is all. Love y'all!!"

However, I am not a TA, and now I'm being asked to administer two quizzes and run an in-class study session. I run study sessions outside of the class. I'm not getting paid for this extra work, by the way. That is because it is not in my job description. I may just list some of this time as professor meetings. I'm really freaked out because I don't want to get in trouble with my bosses for over stepping my boundaries. AAUUGGHH!! Too much pressure and frustration. By the way, in a month we are having the biggest party for Ian's birthday. October 22nd, it's a Saturday. Be there or be square.

Though, the only sickness I can't seem to shake is that pesky borderline anorexia (Just kidding of course. I eat, I swear.) See I can't even make a proper joke, usually not that much of a problem for me. Dammit. I'm watching Forrest Gump for the second time today. On the bright side my computer is back and now works completely. Yay!! And my wireless internet card works, double yay!!

Ian and I went down to Carbondale to visit Sean Soristo, Dan Berck, Bryan Stuart, and Matt Siegel. It was the best time I've had in a while. We left at 10 Saturday morning, because SOMEONE couldn't drag his lazy ass out of bed. Anyway, we got to the house and I made dinner for everyone (bruscetta, manicotti, and cheesecake brownies for those of you who care). Then Ian, Bryan, Sean, and Dan sat around drinking, we were all just shooting the shit for awhile. Then, we watched the Blues Brothers (the Holy Grail of moviedom). We sat on the stoop for a while joking and having fun. Then, Ian and I had to leave at  1 a.m. to go home. This trip was flippin awesome. It made me want to move back to Carbondale even more. I miss it so. Alright, love y'all, miss me, bye!!"

Ian and I went on a walk when we got back to Buffalo Grove. It was like 3-5 miles long. Then Monday we went downtown to shop. Stellar amounts of fun. I got to see my cousin Brett because he works downtown. That was pretty nifty considering I hadn't seen him since last Thanksgiving. Then we went back to Buffalo Grove and had a nice dinner and ice cream. Tuesday we got to go to a pet store. There were so many cute puppies!! And, of course, I named every one of them. Ian took cute pictures with his new camera phone, and then the lady who worked there said we couldn't take pictures. Then we went to the chocolate store. Then Ian and I had dinner with his friend Reesa. She was a complete sweetheart and I was so glad that I got to meet her. Then a couple hours later Ian and Reesa took me to the train station and I had to leave. I had a most awesome time on my visit, and I can't wait to go back!! Love y'all, miss me, bye!!"

Again I apologize for my inability to spell that word. I'm crying on the inside because of it, not really but you know it sounds good. On other fronts, I have three weddings to go to. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel this is wedding overload. If you know that one of your cousins is getting married, do not plan your wedding within three weeks of it. It is just common courtesy. No, I'm not really mad, I just know that I'm gonna be tired. So here's how the wedding agenda breaks down for me this summer. My cousin Chrissy Lehmann is getting married June 11th. Then, I have a nice three week break until my cousin Mindy Lehmann's wedding July 2nd. Then after that wedding and a bit of the reception, I get on a plane that will take me from Champaign to Detroit for Ian's cousin's wedding. (If you don't know who Ian is by now, you are seriously not in the know, and probably living underneath a rock..or in a cave, you know like you do. Did anyone get the Eddie Izzard reference? I hope so.) This wedding is on July 3rd. Oh geez, the tiredness it shall bring. But that's ok, because I must admit I love other people's weddings. They're so pretty and fun. Ok, this was totally boring and I apologize. Love y'all!!"

(Bettie Paige is a hot fifties pin-up with baby bangs, I guess she was somewhat of a fetish model.) Anyway, we were at the Ska House and our friend Jim came over and wanted a mohawk. (This was already the plan for the night.) So my friends Robin and Sarah gave him one. This process involved hair clippers, water, and duct tape. Awesome. Then, Sarah, Robin, and I were like ""Ian you should get one."" He wanted one anyway so he sat down. Robin forgot to wet his hair before using the duct tape so he spent a good twenty minutes trying to get that out of his hair. After that fiasco, he wet his hair and they buzzed off the sides, it looks magnificent. Then, Robin was like we should give you Bettie Paige bangs, and being the impulsive person I am, I was like why the hell not. Doesn't look too shabby, if I do say so myself. I just think it's awesome that most of my extended family is going to meet Ian with his mohawk and pierced ears. He's going to buy a hat, because he's afraid that they won't like it. Whatev.

Also, if Ian's friend comes through Carbondale tonight, I'll get to meet him. That's pretty awesome. Geez, my entries to this thing totally suck.

I was watching CSI: Miami, and the girl who plays Zenon in those movies on the Disney Channel, I believe her name is Kirsten Storms(yes, I know the movies and the actress's name, do something!!), and she killed a cop so he wouldn't find out that she was too young to date her boyfriend, Jo-Jo (short for John Johnson). I just want to make sure that everyone realizes that her boyfriend was a white man with the nickname Jo-Jo!! And she tried to pin the murder of the cop not only on Jo-Jo, but also some random guy who stole the dead cop's gun after the fact!! She told them that this man was Jo-Jo.

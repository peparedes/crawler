"event","my boithday has snuck up on me again.
I will be going to Ghoul Skool next week.
24.
I think I say this every year, but...I thought I'd be locked up in jail or an asylum or be 6 feet under right now. From the kinda shit I use to do back then I have no regrets to speak of. I wouldn't have done anything different.

I got to where I'm today by doing what I did. 
And I think I'm doing alright.

That's all."

"event","I'm sitting here in mah room mixing a tape for Em. KISS, Quiet Riot, Motley Crue and what have you. Gonna post up a big blank piece of canvas on one wall. 9ft x 13ft.....Hmmmm. lotsa space. Also taking my mic stand and wiring a human skull to it along w/ numerous other bones I have acquired.

My back hurts a lot. Must remember when I'm bringing back 50 lbs of aluminum bar stock to my lathe; lift with legs. *nods*

My sister may be coming down for a week to visit and my brother may be going to Double Check(rehab) next week.

I, on the other hand, have become addicted to tying myself up and having someone toss a wolverine high on angel-dust into a steel box along w/ me.

I love my life."

Going to Camarillo.....I think, ""How WHITE of me."" is the correct thing to say. Life has been starting out on a whole new page this year.

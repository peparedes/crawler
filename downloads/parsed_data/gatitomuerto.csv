"event","So let's just rant for a few minutes.  HBP came out last week and everybody and their mother bought it expect me who is beyond broke.  Now all the list and half the stories have spoilers for the book in them.  Couldn't people wait a month.  The next fucking day there was stuff about it online.  Okay, I truly don't care about the spoilers, as long as they are marked clearly.  What gets me is one a couple of the list that I'm on (After Class and Glasses Reflect) there have been plot lines revealed in the subject lines.  Mostly about who dies, which I had already guessed, but I didn't want confirmation until I had read the book.  Stupid idiots.  Oh well, now I know."

Syed was off, the person replacing him wasn't there cuz her grandfather passed away.  One of my other co-workers traded shifts with someone and the replacement didn't show up.  I won't even getting into how much work I had to do.  It was crazy.</font></font>"

"event","<i><font face=""Lucida Sans"" color=""#000000"">Went out with my friends last night and for the most part it was a great time.  Then my supper decided that it didn't like the alcohol I was consuming and tried to make a reappearance.  I ended up going home early.  It so very suck.  Came home and played on the computer a bit before going to bed.  Still sick today.  Can't even blame it on the booze cuz I didn't drink that much.

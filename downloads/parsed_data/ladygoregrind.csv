"event","I am so ridiculously fucking stressed right now. I have so much on my mind and it seems like things can only get worse.

I have to take the math portion of my High Shcool Exit Exam tomorrow morning at 8:00, and I have a feeling that I'm not going to do well.

I have mounds of homework that I do not have the patience to complete fully.

I spent a lot of money that I should not have spent today trying to make myself and others happy, and in the end I just feel guilty.

I tried to balance out my checking account, and the ammount in there is not nearly enough.

I have to work at 4:00 tomorrow to close.

But not before I baby sit for five hours, and not get paid.

I don't have nearly enough hours at work, which is the worst time to deny me them, because I need at least $120 in my bank account by May 22nd to pay for my insurance.

I just got a letter from the courthouse telling me that if I don't pay $50.00 to them, they are going to do all this crazy shit, like put a warrant out for my arrest and inform my probation officer, etc...over a matter of $50 fucking dollars. Like the courthouse and the judicial system isn't well off enough, they have to badger a teenage girl who is trying to make it on her own for $50 dollars just because of possession of a small ammount of drugs.

I am so goddamed stress, and no one is helping me out.
I'm a fucking wreck.
I don't want to eat.
I don't want to sleep.
I can't do anything but worry.

Which is not good for my mind.

SOmeone needs to save me from all of this."

"event","I don't know what it is. I akways have this uncontrollable urge to make him happy. Like today. I was sitting at home on my ass, wishing he wasn't in school so I could have someone to play with, and then thought to myself.....""He's going to be in a bad mood after school....grumpy and such...so I'm going to make him something to eat.""

I slaved in my kitchen for about an hour cooking spaghetti sauce, noodles, and ground meat to put it all together and bring it to him. I even baked Peanut Butter cookies. I packed him a little lunch, and when I picked him up, I could tell that just by thinking of him like that, made him happy. Which makes me happy.

I would do anything for that boy."

"event","This May 1st shit is really starting to get on my nerves.

You know, I wasn't going to say anything in the beginning, because those people have every right in the world to do what they are doing, and as long as it didn't affect me, I was fine with it.

BUT. When I'm trying to drive home, and the main street to my house is blocked off because 150 mexicans are protesting and honking their horns relentlessly, I get a little aggravated. So I have to take an entirely different, longer route, to get to my house? Spending even MORE gas then I intended to in the first place, all because they have to prove a point.

You didn't go to work or school today. Wow. Isn't that why you came to this country? To work, and get your children an education? What are you trying to prove here? That you are even lazier and un-effecient then we thought you were? You're kicking yourselves right now people. You are proving us right.

This isn't a racial issue, so anyone who would like to come back on me complaining that I'm being racist, fuck off. I have nothing against these people, or their cause. If they want to do this, let them. But don't take us down with you. Don't force us to compromise our daily lives just so you can stand out.

It's now 9:00 at night, and I've been hearing the car horns from the barrio for about three hours now. How long is this going to continue? Into the night, when everyone in my house is trying to sleep, so that they can wake up in the morning and haul themselves to work and school?

This actually makes me dread cinco de mayo.

So thank you so much, for making me out to be the bitch."

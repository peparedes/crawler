"event","You know, I am making myself really mad. I can't seem to concentrate on soccer and show the high school coaches that I am a really good player. I seem to be in a slump for some reason or another, and its really starting to make me mad.

I loathe my brothers. They are so noisy. Can't they respect the silence for once in their life? I think not.

They are right behind me, wrestling and having a laughing and noisy fit. I can't say I'm not loud and noisy because I am probably the loudest person you will ever know, but thats only when I am around my good freinds.

Did I mention I am a perverted person too? Always cracking the innocent but gross perverted sicko jokes? Yes...you all know that kind of person, everyone has that person in their group of friends and lemme tell ya, its fun being one.

Spring Break ended yesterday (Sunday) and it was the first day back after a week off and lemme tell ya, it was fun. Well, as fun as school can get I guess. A little homework, not much. Honors English assignment was pretty interesting. I have to write a question from either Romeo or Juliet about their love problem to a 'advice column' and then I have to pretend I'm the advice giver and give him/her advice. Fun? Can't you tell we are on the Romeo and Juliet unit? 

It's kinda weird because we are listening to the most recent disc recording of the play and the voice of Romeo was the guy who played Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter!! So whenever Romeo speaks, I keep thinking that I am watching Harry Potter all over again because he still has that arrogant tone. That actor is good at playing those kinds of characters, I think he was born for it.

I recently found out, even though I am in Honors English, that I have no clue what the parts of speech are or how to pick out verbs and nouns and all that good stuff because I have no clue what is what!! How have I made it through school without knowing that stuff? I hope its not mandatory you know it, because then I'll be in trouble. I don't even know how I am able to write or edit without knowing that stuff. Isn't it a writers common knowledge? ...beats me. I have no clue what the stuff is as I have previously stated.

Ouch. My back hurts now. It might be because I am slumping over. Ahhh, much better now that I am leaning back in my chair.

I should probably go reply to Anna's post in Aether but I have no clue how to respond to it. Til's being weird and I don't exactly know how she will react to Kendricks sudden hug even though she is crying. Hm...this is a dilema.

I should get going. I am craving more pizza now.

Oh, Rhy congrats on the new boyfriend!! I wish you many many good times and lots of happiness!!

Anna - Hana is a cutie!!

"event","Maybe I shouldn't stay away from LJ like that again. This will be my third post in one day. Thanks to Rhy for telling me I should write in it during my boredom earlier today....but I guess it would be 2 and 1/2 considering the previous entry wasn't really a post so I declare it only counting as a half now.

Aw crap, Nicki IMed me while I was trying to write this and when I came back to it, I forgot what I was going to say. I lost my train of thought...not fun.

Oooooo, Dexters Lab is on and DeeDee is chasing an Ostrich around...my brothers watch some weird shows. I prefer MTV, VH1, and ABCFamily myself.

Dinner tyme....be back later maybe...

"event","::sings:: I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa makes all the pretty girls wanna dance!

I love that song. My Band by D-12 featuring Eminem. It's good, you all should listen to it.

It's been a while since I've written in here and for that reason alone is why I cleared out my old posts if you didn't notice already.

Yesterday was a mixture of lots of emotions. My high school team won our first game of the season with a shut out against one of the supposedly ""harder"" teams to beat. The score ended up being 4-0. Yea...I guess that's what you call a hard team to beat when you win with more than two points. I can't help but feel a little depressed because on my other teams I was always a starter and always played more than 3/4ths of the game and for my high school team, I played like, 40 minutes? I played like 10-15 minutes at a time and I wasn't a starter though. Maybe I'm being conceded but at least I can say I played unlike some other people on the team. One girl only played 2 minutes the whole game and then another only played 5 minutes. I can't help but feel bad for them because they aren't that good. Now I'm starting to have doubts too...what if I'm not good enough? Maybe I'm just being paranoid...

Second, it was windy and cold and I was in only shorts and a hoodie that whole day for after my game, I stayed for the JV boys and Varsity girls games. We won both of those too but it was sooooo cold!! The good thing is that Brittni, September, Amber and Ashley were going to Panera and offered to go get me some food because I didn't want to leave the field but I was hungry - so I gave them five dollars and they got me McDonalds!! Chicken nuggets and a chocolate milkshake - (people on the soccer team aren't allowed to have pop, and if we get caught with it, we have extra sprints the next day) - so that made part of my day.

Third, I wanted to strangle Karli, Mikayla, and Krunk. Why do they have to be so damn mean to me? It's really starting to piss me off the way they won't let up - they think they are all high and mighty because THEY are starters. Next time they get on my back, I'm gonna start yelling things at them....maybe add a few selected words in there. No one has really heard me cuss because I never do it and when I do people know I am serious...so maybe that will get it through their head that I am fed up with their crap. We'll see what happens I guess....

Seven hours at the fields and I'm sun burnt and wind burnt. Sounds fun, doesn't it? How in the world can you get sun burnt when it's cold?! Well, obviously you can by looking at my face. It's kinda red and only hurts a little but it means I'm going to have to put sunscreen on the next time I go out in the sun for long periods of time otherwise it'll be worse.

::sings:: UNO DOS TRES CUATRO CINCO CINCO SEIS! 

Sorry, new song came on and that's the beginning part. Everyone should listen to Pretty Fly For A White Guy by The Offspring - its good. Better than My Band I think and that song is pretty good, but once again that's according to me.

Waiting for Anna to post is soooooo boring. I need things to do and sadly, Sunday is my only day off and I've done absolutely nothing all day. Not even a post. I suppose I should write one where the Love and Less family come to Salem but I'm not in the mood to write that...I'm in the mood to write for Til but like I said, Anna hasn't posted and no one is near the goals with the Quaffle where Til is keeping so I can't write for that either. I suppose I could write for Tiff during the match with Aether VS Caelum, but I'm in a slump with that character. I think I lost her personality. I have accidentally made her more social and she's been talking more....opposite of her original personality. I think Til is seeping into her. I seem to do that to all my characters.

Maybe I should go to Quizilla for a while and have a little fun there. I could go look in Anna and Rhy's journals for fun quiz's and maybe even Em has a few that would be fun. Hm....that actually sounds like a plan!

Soon, my boredom will be gone...::mumbles:: if Anna would post soon!

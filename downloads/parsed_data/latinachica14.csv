but i didnt find her, but i saw like 5-8 girls from kuba <STRONG>chasing</STRONG> ashley, and then ashley <EM>jumped</EM> in kau'is car n was <EM>trying </EM>to drive away but she didnt know how to drive dat car (it was a jeep) the kuba gurls caught up to her, opened the car door and <EM><STRONG>pulled</STRONG></EM> her ass out n started <STRONG>kickin her ass</STRONG>...she got away sum how n started running i was standing by my car cuz i thought da cops were coming, so i had my door open about to start my engine so dat ppl could jump in n we could go if there were cops cuz i was <STRONG>not</STRONG> about to get <STRONG>my ass</STRONG> arrested over dat shit...so ashley sees me and jumps in da back seat of my car, all the kuba gurls ofcoarse follow towards my car to try to pull her out again like they did b4, i duno who it was but one of the gurls <STRONG>opened</STRONG> <STRONG><EM>my car</EM></STRONG> door...i was <STRONG>NOT </STRONG>having dat, i <STRONG>closed</STRONG> my door n tol her, do <STRONG>not</STRONG> open my door...da gurl was <STRONG>yellin,</STRONG> all like, ""get her outa da car get her out!"" n ashley was <EM>hysterical</EM>! she was screaming at me, ""yessica get me outa here, drive me away! drive me away!"" at this point was when i was really startin to get pissed the fuck off...my latina side kicked in full force lol...i yelled back at da kuba gurl, i was like, ""no she's not coming outa da car she doesnt wana fight ur ass!"" n da gurl was like, ""no get her out! she wanted to fight before!"", i told her, ""<STRONG>DO NOT</STRONG> open my door,&nbsp;she obviously does wana fight u guys ne more!"" n dats when tara came up to me n just put her arms on my shoulders n told me to <EM>calm</EM> down cuz she didnt want them to start sumthin wit me, but best believe whoever dat gurl was, she didnt lay <STRONG>one</STRONG> damn finger on my car when i tol her not to open my car...after that sum1 yelled po-po so every1 scrambled into different cars n drove off...ashley was crying so bad, she said that like <EM>10 gurls</EM> were on her kicking her, <STRONG>then</STRONG> she started worrying about kau'i askin where she was, but no1 knew...so she was gettin all hysterical again like, ""where's kau'i, i wana be in da car wit kau'i, find kau'i!"" at dat point it was really gettin annoying, i understand <STRONG>why</STRONG> she was so hysterical and all but i was now about to stop da car after sum1 yelled po-po to try n find kau'i when i knew she was prolly fine...angelica, (lauras sister) was a lil worried about laura cuz she said that sum1 hit her, and it was sum gurl that she had talked to earlier n told her not to fight wit laura n da gurl said that she wouldnt...<EM>but</EM> apparantly she did...so now im all tryin to drive <EM>slow</EM> in case of the cops but <EM>fast</EM> enuff to get da hell outa there...everyone in da car is tryina get a hold of sum1 on their cells, laura wasnt pickin up her cell and then ashley <EM>finally </EM>got a hold of kau'i n found out kau'i was <EM>still</EM> at da park cuz her car wouldnt start...she starts to go a lil <EM>crazy</EM> again like, ""omg she's still at da park can u turn around?! plz turn around?! we need to get kau'i!"" we had to tell her to chill out...we're not guna leave her out there like dat i mean really....we go back and shes there but she already got her car jump started and laura is there too with beckah and lynda...so we leave <STRONG>again</STRONG>, and <EM>thank god</EM> thats the end of it...basically it was supposed to be a fight between those two gurls that wanted to fight in the first place with ashley kau'i and laura...but <EM>instead</EM> every1 decided to make up a reason to fight, and although the two orginal gurls <EM><STRONG>did</STRONG> in fact</EM> end up showing up, i think it was mainly every1 else fighting...n u know, ashley may have gotten her ass kicked, but its <STRONG>not</STRONG> like it was a one on one thing...and when i talked to laura she said there were like 3 or 4 gurls kickin her while she was fighting on the ground too...so good job kubasaki!! wut a fair fight....oh and by the way this <STRONG>all</STRONG> really <EM>ruined</EM> my buzz...&gt;&gt;lifes a bitch and then u die, fuck the world and lets get high&lt;&lt;</FONT></P>"

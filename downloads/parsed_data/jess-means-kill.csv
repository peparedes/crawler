"event","i don't want anything right now except sleep. sleep sleep sleep. but i have to write an essay, and it's like 2 in the morning or something. my eyes hurt.

more and more, the best part of every day is when its finally over.
when it's so dark ""i cannot see to see""
when it's so late that time feels like it doesn't exist anymore.

almost everyday i've had that feeling where everything seems like it's just about to fall apart, like everything in my life is on the verge of disaster. and i kind of like it, because things always seem so fucked up that i'm just cool about it because it won't make a difference if i try to fix things cause they're too far gone. i'm imagining how good hitting bottom must feel.


me and Este had a discusion about God yesterday and i pretty much realized i hate him. i just want to hate him for making us so that we have to need him all the time. and because he takes things from us, people we love. people we need more than he does. people who shouldn't die. 

i had OSS today. that kind of sucked. i had to go to ATOSS.
i've has 3 suspensions in the past 2 or 3 weeks.

i'm fuckin living for christmas break.
and a vacation to the condo in sarasota, where i can escape to the beach from everyone.

i really want to go camping soon. me and bruce were talkin about camping a couple nights ago and it sparked a fever inside of me. i love the smell and warmth of a camp fire. and the forest air just kills me.


i have to start buying christmas presents. lindsey i already got you something that you'll love. 

i've been getting back into art lately. i got out my old paint box a couple days ago and it had that amazing, musty oil paint smell.

"event","in regard to last week. man, what a week it was. good times and bad times.
bad times include: 2 days ISS and the creepy people that go along with it, mandatory parent/teacher conference in the classes i'm failing, a few hours of sleep every night, my mom being all up in my business, so much pressure to try harder in school, when school is the last thing on my mind, not being able to go to the bad fish/sublime tribute show or bruce's show.

good times include: drinking and hanging out with lindsey! drinking and hanging out with este and the norm, meeting squirrel, hanging out with drew, meeting hot dudes at beefs and exchanging numbers (i swear, i've met more guys there than anywhere), work.


so many little things have been getting on my nerves lately. and everything has been reminding me of Cody and my constant need for his presence in my life, especially at a time like this, where everything seems like it's falling apart quickly. and graduation is a little more than one semester away and i have no idea what i'm doing. fuck. i just can't wait until next semester, i'm getting switched out of ap euro & analysis of functions so i'll have a much lighter schedule. hell yeah.

in two of my classes today, for some reason we got on the subject of dying/death/cemetaries/unfulfilled dreams and how the dash between a birth date and death date represents everything that a person did in the time they were on earth and i couldn't take it anymore, because all i could think about was Cody Cody Cody and how much i love and miss him and how in 2 months it will be a year we've been separated and how fucking long that seems, when i still have a whole lifetime to live without him. the longest we ever went without seeing each other was probably 3 weeks, even that was unberable. i'm fucking done trying to deal with everything. i don't want to be angry because Cody died, and i don't want to cry anymore. it wears me out. it's just so hard because he feels like a vague memory, and i hate that feeling. and i hate god. and i can't stop feeling this way."

nothing is static. even the <i>Mona Lisa</i> is falling apart.

everything up to now is a story, and everything after now is a story.

first you have to know that you're stupid and you will die. someday you will die, and until you know that, you're useless to me.

this is the greatest moment of your life. don't hear yourself cry.

disaster is a natural part of my evolution toward tragedy and dissolution. i'm breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions, because only through destroying myself can i discover the greater power of my spirit.

it's not enough to be numbered with the grains of sand on the beach and stars in the sky.

you are not your hopes.

under and behind and inside everything i took for granted, something horrible has been growing. everything has fallen apart.


everyone should read fight club at least once in their life.

i swear, i love palahniuk.

ISS sucked today. and it will suck tomorrow. after work i hung out with this dude named squirrel (his real name is earl, which is so rad). anyway he was cool, and hot. he's a BMX dude. nice.

some redneck dudes were hitting on me at work tonight, hahaha. amazing. oh and speaking of work, wtf gary? hahaha, totally random for you to just flake out like that. everyone was like ""where the fuck is gary? dude his car isn't even here anymore.......whaaa.....""

bruce was my pretend boyfriend for one night, haha, and i loved every minute of it. he had to be my 24 year old 6 foot something boyfriend to scare off these idiot teen boys that come up to beef's to harrass me. oh, and bruce had a chef knife, and yeah, it was scary. and mike wanted to fight the idiot boys. i love how the cooks are so protective. they are my best friends forever."

oh my god, i just remembered i have to take the SAT next saturday. fuck. shit. damn, i don't want to take it. most of all i don't want to have to wake up that early.

i'm not happy about things in general right now. actually i'm very restless and frustrated. i feel like screaming at alot of people. i just want to have everything come easy in life. i don't want to have to worry about the future, about deadlines, qualifications, finances....... collede. i fucking hate everything superficial. i want to hit bottom so hard. i just want to give up on everything thats ever defined what i am and what my purpose is in life. i want to lose everything just so i can start fresh and build something new, and better. i could never actually hit bottom though. i can only imagine how wonderful it must feel to actually hit bottom, and know that you are worth nothing, so then everything is meaningless. i'm in such a <i>Fight Club</i> mood right now as you can see. i just want to be Marla. i don't want to try anymore. i want to not care about anything, i want to have fun. i want more time. theres never enough time. i really want to find something meaningful, maybe that will change my mind about hitting bottom.

am i being irrational?

on a side note, Saw ll was crazy.
on another side not, i fucking hate my mom. i guess kaylie was right, i am a cold hearted bitch. it's really rare that i love anyone. i don't love easily. Cody was the only person that i fully loved with all my heart. Cody's dad, my uncle lee, he has been more of a father to me and i love him so much for that. i love my aunt tracey because she is the most giving person you will ever meet. and i love my cousins, mandi & molly because they are so cute and innocent. alot of people aren't worth the time, or they annoy me. i definitely loved Cody more than my mom though. now that i think about it, i really hate god too for taking Cody away from me after only 16 years together. anyone but Cody should've died in that accident. 16 years is nothing compared to a lifetime. i don't even want to think about the fact that in 3 months it will be one year since i last saw Cody. i feel like shit."

saturday morning/afternoon i'm going to the beach with Este & Balasco, hot italian foreign exchange student. he's so beautiful, and his accent kills me. and i think he likes, or he just stares at me alot. the beach should be fun, we're gonna have the guitar and congo drum and hoodies if it's still cold, and blankets. just chillin on the beach. then saturday night me and Este work. after that, maybe a halloween party?

is it wrong that theres this guy that i want to hook up with? is that slutty? not date, just have fun with. he's so freakin hot, we've already messed around that one night on the beach, but i barely ever hang out with him. so thats a new priority. hook up with hot surfer dude.

today was pretty chill. ate at farmers market before school with Este & Wes, the went to school and got checked out at the end of second period. then i went back to school for lunch because seniors got clickers today and i wasn't going to miss out on being able to click that thing with all the other seniors and be totally annoying and no one can do anything about it. we got a whole group of seniors and we marched around the mall and clicked it in all the underclassmen's faces while chanting ""'06!"" that was fun. then josh convinced me to chill with him in 2nd lunch so i did. he's such a hot skater dude. hot hot hot. then i went home. then josh left school around 12:30 and called me so we chilled at the walden lake park and went on a stroll. then we ate at sonic. then he had to go to work. he's a babysitter, haha. i love it. it's so cool because he does <i>not</i> look like someone to watch your kids and keep them safe. josh likes me and i don't know if i like him, but maybe i do. alot of people have told me not to hang out with him though, so i dunno.

<b>priority no.1</b>: figure out what the hell i'm doing!
-i'm living an aimless life right now, this needs to change. immediately.
<b>priority no.2</b>: stop getting bad grades!
-of all the years of high school, i've managed to pick my senior year to fuck around and not care anymore. this cannot happen! i'm failing AP Euro, and who knows what else. oh god.
<b>priority no.3</b>: get some sleep every once in a while for fuck's sake!
-did i mention i never sleep anymore?
<b>priority no.4</b>: stop skipping school!
-whether it's first period or the whole day. i need to quit that shit, even though me and este did it today. last time, i swear.
<b>priority no.5</b>: start saving up my money!
-it's so hard though. i never buy materialistic things either, it's all spent on gas, food (i never eat at home anymore), cigarettes (don't ask me how, but i go through a pack about every 2 days!), booze (alot lately), and little objects here and there.
<b>priority no.6</b>: stop being sick!
-this has alot to do with my current life style of staying up late, drinkin, smokin cigarettes, etc. at this rate i'll never get over the cough i have.
<b>priority no.7</b>: visit allison in jacksonville!
-i'll make a plan to make this happen. or you could just visit me!? i know jacksonville is way cooler than PC though, and we would have alot more fun there.
<b>priority no.8</b>: see lindsey more often!
-we need major hangout time <3
<b>priority no.9</b>: start doing homework!
-thats bringing my grades down the most. i'm just never at home to do it though, and i <i>never</i> want to be home.

i think thats about it.
man i'm tired.

i went to the mall after school today (first time in soooo long) with este and liz and got a backpack that is so cool. i just want to wear it everywhere. i'm so excited about it. back packs are the best thing ever. you can put so much shit in them. i love wearing a back pack at the airport when i'm about to fly somewhere, because it has everything i need in it, and right on my back, and it doen't take up the use of my arms. in NYC, i loved my back pack to death. it was so.......essential. also over the summer when i walk around wisconsin. i could go on and on about back packs.

so i'm worn out, you know, tired as fuck from too much drink, too many cigarettes, not enough sleep. in the end though, it was way worth it. this week has been a lot of fun.

wednesday was awesome. after este got off work me, her, john, josiah, and nole left for cocoa beach around 10 maybe. blankets, sleeping bags, pillows, guitar, hooka, cigarettes, 30? beers, 1 bottle of jagger(sp?), and surf boards crammed into my car and este's jeep. sweet. me and john in my car, este and josiah and nole in the jeep. the ride there was fun. except when it started raining, and i was about to run out of gas and pee my pants. we get there around 1 in the morining and can't find anywhere to really park at, the place we were was sketchy, and a cop almost came by to see what we were up to, good thing he didn't because of all the empty beer cans in the cars. john and nole were drunk so they didn't care and took off with their surf boards and went surfing at the pier. me, este, and josiah went to ron john and the people there said we could park in their free parking. we go there and unload all of our shit mentioned above and go to the beach and start walking to the pier about a mile away. this is when it starts raing, not hard at first, then really hard. so we go find shelter under a parking awning at a hotel. alot of our stuff is wet, and really heavy. so we're sitting there, this is when this dude named mike walking on the road comes over, later named ""sketchy mike"" because he was such a sketch. at first he asks us if we have any trip, and we're like ""nah, we don't do acid....."" we thought he was a cop. it just turns out he's just really weird, and drunk. he got kicked out of some bar and was walking back to his hotel room at the best western, he invited us there, haha, that was a big ""<i>hell</i> no"". before every sentence he said ""quite frankly"". he named me Margo and said my hoodie was ""like the skin of an ancient person"". so the rain lightens up a little bit, and we (including mike) get our stuff together and walk to the pier where we lay out the blankets and stuff. john and nole are in the water and mad as fuck because they were cold and hyperventilating and said we left them there. so while este talked to them me and josiah (mike lurked off some where) moved all of our stuff somewhere else because we got kicked out from under the pier because we weren't allowed to camp out there. all the blankets were so wet, me and josiah were about to die from the cold and the little blanket we were under was <i>not</i> working. so we used body heat, hahaha, until it started getting light out. no body slept at all except john, he was passed the fuck out. somehow in the morning, all the booze was empty except for a couple shots, the beer had all been drunk, most of the cigarettes were gone, and alot were soggy. the guys went surfing at sunrise and didn't stop until we left around 3. me and este chilled on the beach and smoked the hooka, it definitely attracted people, dudes where like ""hey hooka girls, let me hit that"". me and este ate lunch on the pier and after that we loaded up the cars and left, hung over, covered in sand, and tired as fuck. on the ride home me and josiah kept smoking just to stay awake. john was passed out in the back seat. este and nole were in the jeep, cold as a bitch probably. we finally get to PC around 5 and dropped the dudes off at nole's house and said farewell. now, all i want to do is chill at the beach.


that was such rad night. good times, good people, hooked up with a hot dude, got some sun, made some good memories. i'm happy to say the least."

"event","......when you are a girl, it's way easier to get alcohol when you are under age. because me and Este have been drinking alot lately, and buying it on our own. yeah yeah yeah Este has a fake ID but she doesn't use it all the time. we drank at the club in Ybor when we went to that rap show (Este had her fake ID but i didn't, and the bar tender still asked me what kind of drink i wanted), we ordered peach daquiris(i probably spelled that so wrong) and margaritas at olive garden, then went to Skipper's in tampa and both ordered a couple rounds of shots at the bar, again i wasn't even asked to show an ID. we've bought bacardi raz a couple of times (our new fav. chillin out drink), and last night before the baseball game we went to a gas station to get some bacardi watermelon and Este told the dude she didn't have her ID and all he asked was her birthday. i love this.

so life is, okay. recently it is. this is just a life update.

here is what i've been up to:
-<u>saturday</u>: after work i went over to Este's to hang out with everyone after they got back from homecoming. we hung out in the hot tub and pool with every one (about 10 people). will anderson was there, haven't seen him in a while. then me, Este, and Liz almost finished off that bottle of everclear (ew, i know). i got sick. we hung out in Este's portable (her house is the best hang out place ever) behind her house where we played the poll game which is so much more fun when you are drunk because you tell the truth. then we all crashed in the portable. me and Este were up though, and went skinny dipping in the hot tub then ate some food.
-<u>sunday</u>: me and Este went to work with hang-overs from hell. after work we went to payless and laid on the floor, then chilled at liz's house, then i had to drop Este back off at beef's cause she was workin a double. after she got off i came back to pick her up and we hung out at beef's because we're losers.
-monday: school. then at 8 me and Este drank some bacardi and went to the beef's baseball game to root for the boys and marcy. after the game we went back to beefs for because everyone was going back there to drink and eat. we hung out with managers seth and trevor and the owner, jim. we had some good laughs. they were like ""you guys are drinkin on a monday?"" then they said ""oh wait, it's columbus day......""
-<u>today</u>: school. then after that me and Este took john, josiah, and nole to noles house and smoked hooka with them and had a couple of beers. it was so good. the hooka, i mean. it was mango flavor and it rocked. then josiah freestyled, hahaa.
-<u>tomorrow</u>: school, then Este has to work, and after she gets off, me and her, john, josiah, and nole are going to cocoa beach to spend the night and drink and smoke hooka and the guys will surf. that will be an awesome night, i can already tell.
-<u>thursday</u>: be at the beach for a little bit, get some sun. go home, get some sleep. then later that night go to howl-o-scream with gary, mike, este, and who else.
-<u>friday</u>: german food at Danderbak's with lindsey(!) and who ever else is going.

i don't feel like continuing the rest.

so i'm excited about all the events coming up. damn, this will be the most exciting week ever. it looks like i have a really cool life doesn't it?

okay, i'm tired as fuck. and i have to write down an itinerary for tomorrow because i have so much shit that i need to do it's not even funny. so bye bye."

so many things to look forward to next week:
-wednesday, i can sleep in, then go to school at 11.
-thursday NO SCHOOL!!!! and going to howl-o-scream with gary, este & mike, and liz & dave. this will be a very good night.
-friday NO SCHOOL, but i have to work, that doesn't matter though because work is practically like hanging out with friends, just in between chatting i'm cleaning tables and running food.
-tonight we're camping out in este's back yard, hahaha. i guess mom forgot about me being grounded. she always forgets. i got home last night from work at 12 and she was sleeping, i took a shower went in my room, then around 1 in the morning she like ""are you going out tonight?"" i could've said ""yes"" and she would have been ok with it. she usually pitches a fit when i'm not home around 1:30. sometimes i don't get that woman. i was too tired though, i was gonna hang out with mike and jeff, or at a party with andrew, but i just slept.


last night at work, the drunkest guy was st the bar, named bill. haha he was so funny and crazy. me and este were fucking around with him. he ws telling us his philosophy of looking at things as half full instead of half empty, and he held up his beer mug and there was like 2 inches left and he was saying that he sees it as half full. i guess you had to be there."

sooooooo i love working at beef's. me and este have so much fun that even when we're off work we just hang out with the dudes and smoke out back and talk and drink. i got kinda drunkish tonight, and that feels good. and my love lindsey came to visit me after work at beef's and we hung out there with the guys until about 11. then we went out to lakeland and chilled at lake mirror and i drank a little more. then we came back to plant city and met up with andrew and daniel hady. we all went to the park by the bevy and andrews house to swing. this is where i thought i was about to be robbed and killed. lindsey and hady were on the playground and me and andrew were on the swings when this mexican dude walks really fast toward me and my purse on the ground. on the inside i was freakin out. then he stops walking and asks if we're this bald guy he's looking for and we told him no and then he asked us what we were doing at the park, then he finally left. too tired and buzzin for that shit.

i'm sooooo tired right now. my buzz is wearing off. i still have like a whole bottle of everclear (freakin 151 proof) for the future. what i like about it is i don't have to drink alot to get drunk, so it'll last me a while. oh and wes gave me and este the greatest tip ever for drinking liquor. what you do to take away the burn and nasty taste is take a long drag of a cigarette (hold it in) take a shot, chase it, then exhale the smoke. it totally works and is the best thing ever.

being sick is getting old, real quick.

i've almost been up for 24 hours straight.

i dunno what i'm doing tomorrow, i've got to work at 6, but before that i'm free if anyone wants to hang out.

country music sounds sooooo good right now.

for some reason, i'm sad."

"event","why can't life be easy? why can't i get what i want and actually keep it? or not loose what i already have?

why is an education so important nowadays? okay i'm going to be a complainer for a few minutes and rant about school. i hate it and never want to go back there again, maybe it's just senioritis. the sad thing is, i used to love school (except waking up early, thats the only thing i didn't like) i used to love learning, but i think that was up to the point where i was finishing learning the basic skills and knowledge i needed for life. really, when you think about it, the classes i'm taking right now are useless to me, they're just hard classes that i have to take in order to fill up my schedule. AP Euro, AP Literature, Economics, Analysis of Functions, Philosophy, French II, American Popular Culture (it's not what i though it was going to be, we haven't even touched any real pop icons like andy warhol or marilyn monroe, all we ever talk about is stupid celebrity gossip and the domination of walmart. stupid as fuck) all these classes, i bet you 100 dollars, i will never use any of the knowledge from them, i'll even forget it all by the time i'm 30.

also...

and, maybe i'm sounding desperate, but i just want a guy right now, i want a guy to listen to me and hug me and tell me everything i want to hear. having a guy give you a comforting hug is so much better than a girl (like a BFF) because guys are just stronger and give off vibes that hint of security. gary, i totally appreciate and love you for just listening to me. i wish you lived in PC, then instead of IMing each other late at night we could go get coffee and smoke or something, haha.

the show didn't start until around 12:30 so we just hung out and got drinks from the bar thanks to Este's awesomely fake ID. the first rap group was good, then there was a open mic battle and that was awesome. i don't know how those guys can freestyle like that. it was like a scene from 8 mile, where two guys are on stage with their crews behind them and they each have a certain amount of time to rip on the other guy while the dj just plays beats. after that, around 1 a.m. or so, trevor's (my manager) group, the Ces Crew, went on stage and like all the Beef's crew was there representin' in the crowd. me and Este were drunk and dancing with the other girls from Beef's. after that me, este, and mike walked around ybor for a bit, then went back to the club and hung around for a little bit then left around 2. when we got to este's we went swimming, then i took a shower and went to bed, finally.

"event","apathy totally feels good right now. and i've been so apathetic lately, but in all the wrong situations. like school......i just feel so apathetic towards it. i'm not failing or anything, but i'm not making all A's and B's.......and lately i've just had the urge to <i>not</i> go to school, though most of the time i don't give in to the urge, but on monday i did. i was already 10 minutes late and about to turn in to school when all of a sudden i just kept going straight, and didn't stop driving, not knowing where i was going. i ended up at the little airport in lakeland. me and sally used to eat breakfast there and i figured that would be a good place to go. there was about 5 other people in the restaurant. i had coffee and a bagel. then i went out on the balcony for the longest time, and watched a plane leave and one fly in, then a hellocopter landed. i left after that and went to the south side of lakeland and got lost on some back roads. then i made it to the parkway and got off on florida ave and went to lake mirror where, by the water, i read The Stranger by Albert Camus and had a couple cigarettes. very interesting book. then i took a long stroll around the whole lake. it was such a beautiful and nice day out. the air smelt so fresh, almost like ocean air. i wanted to eat it all up. after that i went to target on the north side. got a pair of sunglasses i love. then i went to the mall and did some more shopping because i had some money on me and i didn't like what i was wearing. in my car i changed shirts. after that, i of course had to go to Barnes & Noble and i had the best meal of a pumpkin spice frapp and a tomato basil pretzel stuffed with cream cheese. then i went back to plant city for my moms b-day celebration at my grandparents house.

so many things about that day just make me so happy, not being in school, and doing whatever i want because i was free to do whatever i want. and <i>that</i> is why skipping is so fucking addicting. and to make it even worse, i've just been having these feelings of apathy towards school. but i have to care! i have to make good grades, i can't fuck shit up this year.

lately, the best part of my week is friday. when i get off school and then go to work with Este at 6. then we go to her house and go swimming or in the hot tub. same routine on saturday, except i have the whole day to do whatever. i don't even mind working friday and saturday nights anymore. those are the nights i get paid the most anyway. and work is fun. it pays for my cigs, gas, food, clothes, happiness.

is it wrong that my mood just went up because i remembered i still have an ample amount of rum left over from today? i'm deciding on whether to continually sip it through out the day tomorrow to keep a buzz throughout school or save it up and get drunk off of it. hahaha, Este was right, she is a bad influence on me. but at least i'm happy, or just content, for now.

i still feel like theres alot more i'm leaving out, but i'm so tired.

first we went out to channel side with his best friend Este and her date Cory. Este's aunt's artwork was on display and for sale and there was this charity hairstyling thing going on and alot of drunk people. so we hung out there for a while and watched fire works then ate at Stumps, a really cool restaurant with this strange, eclectic style to it. after that we went back to Este's house, which is really cool. then Cory had to leave, so just me and Gerrod went in the hot tub. that was fun. then at about 1:00 a.m. we had to leave so he took me home. and that we the best night i've had in a long time. i needed that too. i get along so good with Gerrod, and every time i'm around him i can't stop smiling, it's crazy. we have like 3 classes together and it's so hard to pay attention to the teacher and my work because he is so hot. ah, i'm actually happy, thank god.

"event","ahh....being sick is for the weak! not jess!

my life-threatening ailments were definitely inticed by the fact that i've been getting only a few hours of sleep every night. i had to leave school at 11 today, i couldn't take it any longer. my malady seems to only be getting worse. not only am i sick, but my heart has been aching for Cody. i don't know why lately i've been missing him so much. at the mention of his name i just want to cry. after school i came home and ate some home-made chicken noodle soup then decided, in spite of my weak state and the hot weather, to visit Cody's grave. on the way there i was crying and got mascara all in my eyes and down my face. i was in brandon when my mom called and told me that my aunt (Cody's mom) is pregnant. in my current state of weakness, sadness, and frustration, i managed to understand what this means. in this time of loss, a new cousin is going to come into my life. i'm happy and sad; happy that i'm going to have a new cousin, sad that Cody isn't here to see his new baby sister or baby brother. then i thought how bad my heart will break if it <i>is</i> a boy and if he'll look like Cody when he gets older. i guess i'm just hopelessly trying to figure out a way to some how find some one like Cody. i hope to god it's a boy, and i hope he'll be exactly like his brother.

anyway, at Serenity Meadows (the cemetery) it was so damn hot. i layed my towel down and sat in the heat for so long, ignoring this fever and the awfull sweat. i just layed there and propped up my pictures of me and Cody in front of me and thought about nothing for once. i just listened, looked at my surroundings. i just stopped thinking. that seems to be the only place i can ever do that, turn my mind off, or just think about Cody.

i had no idea i would ever miss him this much. i guess loosing him was just so unthinkable that i had no idea of the magnitude of pain i would feel, because i didn't think hurting this bad was humanly possible. the closest i ever got to missing him this bad was when i was a kid and i'd miss him at night when i was laying in bed and i'd cry for him sooo bad. when i was little, the though of loosing him was almost as scary as the thought of loosing my parents because he was the only best friend i had growing up, and i was with him almost everyday of my life. even as a kid, i had this unyielding love for him, i can't even describe it. i didn't have to love him, or play with him because we were cousins, i did it because i plain out loved him."

"event","i'm so glad the weekend is here. so far, two days of school have been enough. all of my close friends are already out of high school, and that makes me so lonely at school. i don't have lunch with anyone i know, so the past two days i've gone home for lunch, and i'm not saying thats a bad thing, because i totally enjoy being able to get away from school for a little break and have a cig, but these past two days i was lucky that no AP's have caught me. today mr. stone was lurking around the parking lot, but he left so i snuck out. one of these days there will be someone in the parking lot looking for skippers though. and i kind of want to go to lunch because seniors have their own eating section now, and i don't get to enjoy my superiority because i have no one to sit with! ah. i miss lunch with sally and linz. i miss talking and laughing with linz at lunch (so many good times), i miss skipping lunch with sally, because it's so much more fun to skip with some one. we'd go get coffee or subway or slurpies. driving with the windows down. i don't know what i'd do if i didn't have my car. i just hope i don't get caught skipping lunch, because i <i>really</i> don't want ISS again. seniors should be able to leave for lunch. we own the school.


i was so tired today. having to wake up at 6:30 every morning is killing me. the day before school i couldn't sleep until around 3 or 3:30 am and yesterday i went to bed a little after 2 am. i'm just so nervous at night. and last night i cried for hours, mostly about how i miss Cody and how we were supposed to graduate together this year and a little bit because i'm just so afraid of the future. i thought being a senior would feel a whole lot better than this.


after school today i felt so apathetic (i was gonna call you linz, but like i said, i felt numb and lethargic, sorry). kaylie invited me to go to dinner with her, ryan and their friends kelcy and keith before they went to see dukes of hazard, and i agreed. Chili's was noisy and i didn't like it, but the food was good and so was the conversation. after that we split up, they went to the movies and i headed home. when i was on MLK and almost home i turned around back to brandon to visit Cody's grave. on the way there, i was driving on the same route as the procession on the day of his funeral and i just started crying and thinking about how much humbled Cody would have been if he could have seen the way traffic stopped for him, and the way the police men bowed their heads when the hearse arrived at the cemetery. being at the cemetery was just what i needed. finally i felt relaxed, and i could talk to Cody and tell him all that was on my mind. i layed on a towel in the grass and almost fell asleep it was so comfortable, the grass was thick and like a cushion. it was about 7:30 so the air was cool. lying there, i felt at home. after a good cry i was relieved.

i miss being in riverview. i miss the summer. i miss sleeping in, at <i>least</i> till 9 am. i miss summer so bad i could cry. i miss the years when two people were still in my life.


something fucking amazing better happen to me this year, because i need it so bad."

"event","i picked up my schedule today. and i'm pretty excited about it. i got alot of teachers i like and mostly all of the classes i'm looking forward to, except analysis of functions and health class <-- mainly because it's a freshman class i never took and i'll probably be the only senior in the class. my sis kaylie went with me, which was weird because she volunteered to go with me. after that she drove me too a work site in plant city where her fiance's company is working, then we decided to go to Chili's in plant city. when we walk in the hostesses were staring like they had just been talking about us and one of then asks if we are sister and says that we look alike then she tells us that we remind her of jessica and ashley simpson (kaylie being jessica and me ashley). i thought that was a pretty good compliment. so half way through our meal this guy sits next to me in our booth and it was kaylie's fiance ryan. he was out with a friend and spotted us. he was telling me about the job they're doing in PC (laying the foundation for a subdivision) and he said i could drive over there tomorrow and he'll teach me how to drive his huge green tractor, but i don't know if he was kidding or not.....

anyhow, tomorrow is my last free day, most of the time i'll be packing up and moving back to plant city (which i don't want to do) i love it here in riverview, i love living in Cody's room.

i just want to get this year over with, graduate, go to college, work, enjoy some life, then die. it seems like after high school life will be quick like that. 

i'm restless, the tv is depressing me, but it makes the silence go away.

"event","why can't things just be simple?

i see a future ahead of me where i have to try to survive. i have to earn a living, go to college. right now (and maybe i'm just saying all of this because i'm <i>completely</i> tired tonight) i just want to be like my sister. she's 18, right out of high school and engaged to a guy thats rich and about to take over his dad's million dollar business, he's already making plans to build their house out in fort lonesome on his family's 9,000 acres of land. he's going to buy her a new 2005 mustang (his dad bought his mom a new mustang when they got married, it's kind of like a tradition), she doesn't have to start a career, or go to college. she's set for life, and engaged to a handsome, well-mannered, all-american country boy. i want that. i want to be like a girl from the 50's: engaged after high school and on her way to be a wonderful housewife. i guess i'm kind of jealous. maybe i don't really want all that, i'm just so tired right now that thinking of college and careers and the future is making me even more tired, and the thought of being rich and not having to worry about that stuff sounds so good to me.

i just really want some one to take care of me, tell me everything will be alright, tell me that i will <u>NEVER</u> have a reason to cry again.

because i'm so tired of worrying about the future. because i'm afraid. i'm afraid of everything. most of all i'm afraid about Cody not being with me, but that fear is inevitable. shit. i'm anxious.

i just want a simple life.

i used to want to live in a big city. now, i want a house in the country with a huge front porch with rocking chairs. i want to have that smell of hot air and grass coming through my windows. i want to stay in florida, or at least in the south, because i love everything about the south. i don't want to be a yankee. this is where Cody is, and this is where my home will always be. i'd never leave that behind for anything. i just want to be able to have what i want, to enjoy life with people that love and appreciate me.

i just want to be happy. and i think i fucking deserve it."

"event","sometimes when you're feeling so alone, just hearing a loved ones voice makes all the difference in the world. like, hearing their voice makes you feel at home, even when you're miles and miles away. i guess i'm just missing Cody so bad right now, and i've gone through almost every home video of me and him, just staring at us grow from being in diapers, to little kids, to teens, then it stops. and i love hearing his voice, his voice just feels like home, like where i'm loved, where i want to be. forever. i hate missing him like this. and i just want to say to him, ""just please be here with me always."" i can't believe it's been 6 months already since the accident. being separated from him for this long will be the hardest thing i ever have to do.

i
feel
miserable.


sooo, tonight, i'm useless. i just feel like nothing matters, and it never will again. all of a sudden i just realized my lack of social skills, and how they have inhibited a potential happiness inside of me. i'm going into my senior year with only 3 people that i can call my friends.......3 PEOPLE! i'm such a loser. i know people from classes i've had, but when it comes to being social with these ""acquaintences"" i can't do it. most of the time in class i avoided people because i couldn't relate to any of them. for instance, the stupid shit and gossip the people my age talk about just annoys me. in class, either i'm listening to the teacher, doing my work, or reading a book. and sometimes i just sit there and think, ""oh my god, how can i bare this any longer?"" i can't stand the kids talking about their petty problems, how their boyfriend is cheating on them, or how they want to go to a party this weekend, or how their best friend stabbed them in the back. if i had problems like that, i would be the happiest kid ever. after Cody died, i came back to school and i felt like screaming at the next person complaining about a problem they wouldn't remember in a year. maybe i was mad that everyone around me hadn't lost their cousin and best friend like i did. most of the time i just felt like giving up. all i know is that teenagers just piss me the fuck off so bad. allison was the only one that knew with so much understanding everything i'm feeling right now. sometimes thinking of the past makes me feel like shit.

my anxiety is getting the best of me. sometimes i'm too nervous to even go to the grocery store by myself, or barnes&noble. and i'm always paranoid, like i always think people are outside my window at night. i think i'm going off the deep end.

my head hurts from crying, and i don't know what to do with myself. i've chewed my lips up, i'm so nervous. my nails, i've picked them down to the quick. it feels way later than it is.

and tomorrow i'm supposed to go to Fort Lonesone to ride horses or go mud slingin' or fishin' or something..."

first of all, Key West owned. there's no way to describe the good times.
some of the best things were:
-the late nights staying up with ryan, javi, and mike (A.K.A. kip)
-the drag queens on Duval Street at 12 a.m.
-the 4 foot dolphin (mahi mahi not flipper) i caught
-the long days out on the boat
-the trip out ot the Dry Tortugas (only 30 miles from Cuba!)
-the haunted ghost tours around Key West
-getting a couple hours of sleep every night
-watching the sunset across the ocean from the boat
-heart to hearts with ryan at night, or ""sitting on the liars chair""
-javi making me laugh so hard i almost pee my pants
-me & javi drinking straight from coconuts that we found at Fort Jefferson at the Dry Tortugas because we were soooo thirsty.
-climbing the tree to get my coconut
-listening to mike jones practically the whole time
-2 & 1 and <i>bad</i> karaoke
-javi being a hustla when we roll through MIA then almost getting killed by a drug dealer
-last but not least, my ryan proposing to my sister and the i karat rock now on her finger, dang that thing sparkles in the dark! they've only known each other for about 3 months....

i probably forgot to add a bunch of other things.

my trip to Wisconsin wasn't as great. mainly because i missed Cody so fucking bad. in the keys there were alot more people my age that went and more laid back people that you could chill with so i was always having fun and doing something. in Wisconsin, the only person for me to really hang out with was Cody. i thought going to Wisconsin would be better but it wasn't. i went to all mine and Cody'd favorite haunts but it wasn't the same at all, because it was just me, walking around watertown or at the damn. i mean i did have some fun because going out of state it always a nice change, but i just felt really alone. some of the better parts were:

-the safe feeling of being in a small, old town with old houses and ice cream parlors
-going to milwaukee for a trip to some awesome museums
-catching fire flies at night and putting them in canning jars
-laying in the soft, thick, ant free grass of wisconsin after catching fire flies
-hanging out with mike (a way distant and very handsome realitive) and his friends in some ancient house they own with an actual cistern in the basement for drinking water and shower water. this house was <i>so</i> old.
-going to the Dells and staying in a huge condominium on lake Delton at a resort called the Wilderness
-buying new moccs
-going to a magic show and a 50's music show.

i was missing florida like crazy. i hated being surounded by all those yankees. i just wanted the south and everything thats included in it. i just wanted to be back in florida because here i feel closer to Cody. i was becoming homesick. now that i'm living in riverview i usually visit Cody's grave every other day and being in wisconsin for so long i wasn't able to do that. ah, i'm just glad to be back. i'm also sad, i know why too. i cried alot tonight. the 13th was supposed to be Cody's 17th b-day, that was a pretty shitty day. i cried alot the night before, didn't get much sleep, woke up early to get a b-day ballon and flowers to put by his grave and the accident site. the whole day i was just so restless. i'm just so tired of crying, and i'm gonna have to live with this for the rest of my life, and wonder what my future would have been like with him in it.

i'm not happy at all. i'm tired. i feel like shit."

Lonesome shirts. i love Ft. Lonesome. there, you feel isolated from the rest of the world, and sitting on the porch on a rocking chair is part of your daily routine. i could live in the country in a heart beat.

after that we went to ryan's house. he was doing some contracting work out in st. pete with his dad but his mom (mrs. debbie) was there, so we stayed and talked to her for hours and i love her. she is the <i>nicest</i> lady ever, and she has that real country southern drawl. while we were over there we talked about ryan's younger brother Justin that died a year ago in a car accident like Cody's, he was the same age as Cody also. we talked and cried and laughed and it felt so damn good to be around people that know how fucking bad it hurts, how bad it hurts to have some one so close die like that. in a stupid car accident. while we were there we talked about how similar Cody and Justin were and how we wished they were here so bad. my eyes started hurting from crying and holding in most of my tears. after that we walked around some of their amazing property around the house.

then after that ryan came home and went out to the fields because he does controlled fires and some guy was showing him some land that needed to be burned. his friend Dallas came over and then left after a while. it started raining. me and ryan went out on the front porch and talked about the rain. then linz came and joined us and we talked some more. then we left to eat some bbq at Sonny's in Sun City(?) because thats the closest town that has restaurants, besides Wimama(sp?) and there you'll get shot. and all they have are tacos to eat there.


so now i feel all country and i <i>like</i> it.


oh yeah, i almost forgot to mention. on the way home from Ft. Lonesome, we were driving down fish hawk and we saw an orange construction cone one the side of the road where there was a huge hole dug in the ground with a machine pumping stuff out of the hole. i had to steal it so we turned around and pulled up by the hole. the machine was turned on and pumping to i guess there were construction workers in the hole so i got out of the car and stood by it until a couple of cars passed tryin to not look conspicuous, then i ran to the cone went the coast was clear, got it to the car, then shoved it in. but it didn't go in all the way so my head bumped into it. i managed to get it in but now i have a big red swollen bump on my forehead. it's a good thing i have bangs. that was exciting."

i figured that i just won't sleep tonight, i can't sleep, if i even close my eyes tonight there is nooooo fucking way i'll have the strenght to get up out of bed in the morning. you guys don't even understand, it's so hard to get me out of bed. if my house was burning down, and i was really tired, i'd just lie in bed until the flames got close enough to be dangerous.

speaking of fire, tonight linz and i bought some bottle rockets and set them off at the park in walden lake, and sally rode her bike to the park to meet up with us. we had alot of fun, and alot of close-calls. good good. then a security dude drove up to close the gates so we had to leave, when we were driving out of the park he gave us the meanest look ever.

even though tonight was more fun than most nights, right now, i feel like shit. and, yeah, i'm gonna cry. you know about the usual. Cody......
if everynight is gonna end this way, i don't know how much more i can take.

From now on, i hate the song ""help us stay alive"" by explosions in the sky. i haven't listened to it since i got the call about the accident, when i was sitting in my room. i was just listening to EITS and i forgot to skip that song. i hate it, i hate it. i hate the name of it, i hate how at that certain part in the song it's like everything is crashing, because thats exactly how i felt, and i never want to feel that again. i never want to feel like ""oh my god, this isn't happening. this can't EVER happen!"""

good book. so far.


so i've been practically living in Riverview, and i love it. i sleep in Cody's room, now it's practically mine. i'm about 15 minutes away from barnes & noble. i'm not in plant city, the only time i've been there was a couple nights ago when i drove home to get my clothes.

i go to barnes & noble almost everyday. all i want to do is read, and drink irish breakfast tea with milk, eat oatmeal. i mean, really eat it.

why do i refuse to go to bed? i'm just sitting here, listening to music, it's 4:07 in the morning and i'm kinda tired, but my body refuses to go to bed, like it's waiting for something to happen. but nothing will. i didn't go to bed till 6 in the morning today, and i slept for a few hours. i usually go to bed around 4 in the morning. it's like theres so much i can do, why would i want to miss it all by going to bed. over here i have cable tv, that means i can watch the history channel whenever i want, and there's always something on the history channel that i <i>cannot</i> miss. ahhhh.

so i've just been putting songs on my jukebox, i have 510 songs already on it.

"event","i can't stop crying.
saying sorry to the air isn't enough.
i just keep repeating, ""i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry. i'm sorry it had to happen this way. i'm so sorry i couldn't be there with you to hold your hand and tell you everything will be okay, you <i>will</i> keep breathing. i'm so fucking sorry.""




being happy is overrated.
feeling like shit is the new feeling like a million bucks.
depression is the new happiness."

"event","right now, i'm drinking V8 splash right out of the container.

i'm at home, i'm supposed to be in sarasota, at the condo. i left tonight, late tonight. i stormed out because i was mad. i wish i wouldn't have. i'd much rather have a panoramic view of the ocean from the huge windows at the condo than the view of my neighborhood from my bedroom window tomorrow morning. whatever, i'm already tan as all get out. fuck you sarasota. you and your oncoming red tide.

right now, i'm looking at the sand still in between my toes. stupid beach. my skin, it still smells like the ocean. my hair, yeah, it still feels coarse from the sea water. and i love it.

i ate too much at waffle house.

right now, i want a cheap cup of coffee from a cheap diner. coffee that's too strong.

on the way home tonight, i got off on the brandon exit instead of taking the interstate all the way to PC. i hate driving on the interstate at night, you feel more alone. on 60, there were more cars and lights around me and i didn't feel as alone, i felt more like i was apart of something, like how in <i>Choke</i>, victor finds traffic jams just so he can feel like he's part of something, playing commuter.

i don't know what i'm going to do tomorrow, i might go to work, i should go to work, i dunno. i'm too damn lazy. maybe i'll wake up early and go to the airport to eat again. all i know is that i have to find a good cop-out for the beach, seeing as i'm not there anymore. maybe i'll go to lake mirror. oh shit, i wasted almost all my gas driving to and from sarasota. ahhh.

i love sigur ros. like, i love them with a passion, i could listen to them for hours. especially the song i'm listening to (you know allison, the one with the gay kid on the music video we used to watch, while on coricidin)

right now, i just want to talk to cody, tell him everything that's aggrivating me, pissing me off. and have him tell me everything will be okay, that no one can ever hurt me.

omg i'm fucking crawling out of my skin. it's the worst feeling. i can't get what i want because what i want doesn't exist anymore."

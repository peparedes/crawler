How far I have strayed from the path of ""good students"" all over the world...

That's depressing

This is turning out to be a REALLY long day! Go figure, right? I mean, it's not like this is my last day in CONN before I return to MoCo in all its dysfunctional goodness, or anything. This morning we were supposed to go camera shopping at 9. Didn't happen. I woke up at 8:30 and my mom was running around the house frantically trying to get everything done before we went out to go shopping. She needed to record something for nursery school, so my dad got all involved. and time just stopped. 9 came and went. I was showered, and listening to music outside. Finally they were ready to go, and then to spite them I ran back inside and went to the bathroom.

Then they both went back inside and followed suit. Grr!!! We got out of the house around 10 and went to Staples, the closest camera dealer in town. I picked out the most expensive one they were willing to buy (of course!) and then came home and played with it. And let me say...MAN AM I GOOD LOOKING (herein lies an open invitation to ego smattering by ALL of you...lol).

Anyway, this afternoon I'm eating lunch at this indian restaurant in New Haven, where my recorder teacher is celebrating ""3 August Birthdays, 1 Anniversary, and 1 December Birthday"". Yeah, quite the shindig. Then I go home and play cards with my mom, my aunt, and Jean-Claude. It should be fun.

Then I get to talk to Marly and hear about her wedding-related experiences of the day (which I can't wait to hear about!).

Then I go to bed.

Then I wake up.

And pretty much by this time tomorrow I will be at MoCo!!!

Oh, Happy Day!!! (Or should I say ""Tomorrow""?)

P.S.
I am using old school, non-click wheel iPod for the trip tomorrow. (If you really needed to know)"

Wait.

I should be in Bethlehem sometime between 12:30 and 1 on Sunday which is AWESOME!!!

See you all soon!

Right now I am an undeclared Sophomore at MoCo focusing on Early Music and the recorder. I can definitely see a future in that niche, given I take the necessary strides to get there, but at the same time I know there are also a million other things I could do equally well. Oh, the joys of aspiring to be a Jack Of All Trades. Hopefully things will pick up once the school year commences...

Until then, worry worry worry worry worry.

Good times.

Last weekend was amazing, as expected. It was wonderful having Marly come and visit again and get to chill with me, my friends, and my family. I was working two of the four days she was here, which was terrible, but somewhat remedied by the fact that my first shift was only four hours long. And that during my eight hour shift on Sunday my best friend back home, Jean-Claude, took her and his girlfriend, Robyn, to the local carnival where he showed everyone a good time and won lots of expensive prizes for the ladies. I'll admit I was jealous, having to work and all, but knowing Marly was NOT bored out of her mind made the whole thing okay. Monday night we watched the Rocky Horror Picture Show at Jean-Claude's, but were unable to do The Time Warp, due to certain distractions (if you really want to know, ask Marly. She was there!). Jean-Claude and Marly really get along. So do my parents and Marly, for that matter. In fact, everyone gets along with Marly back home; this is a very good sign!

I can't wait for the 20th to get here. My last day of work is tomorrow, and I am SO ready to be out of there. I have two more paychecks coming that should keep me afloat until work study kicks in, so it likes I will be pretty well off financially next year. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again.

This summer is almost over! SCORE!!!

So what does this mean? Most likely what I already knew: Aside from a few ""musical tendencies (i.e. Band Geek) I really had no ""trend"". I floated around all those Labels, befriended people from every track of High School life and was actually pretty popular despite my lack of participation in parties/big social gatherings. So here's MY High School label...

WHERE IS ""JOCK""?!?!?! There were CERTAINLY a good number of jocks at my school. Somehow I think that was the case everywhere..."

"event","Well, so goes another day in my boring summer life. As expected, my day is going eerily similar to the LAST 2 MONTHS of my summer: I wake up around 7, sit up and turn off my alarm clock, and then somehow manage to crash back into my pillow and sleep for another 2 hours. But I'm up now, which means my day has ""officially"" begun. So what am I going to do? Probably nothing. I'd like to say I'm going to read some Voltaire, Chaucer, or Hemingway, practice for 4 hours, and maybe pay a visit to the gym. You know, any way to ""better"" myself. But I won't. I'm going to go on with this day like I have all summer; be lazy and hate myself for being so. I have work at 5 (until midnight) which sucks, but I'm only working until August 11, plus Marly's coming to visit next weekend, so I guess the rest of my summer won't be ALL bad. Actually, next weekend will be quite wonderful, despite me having to work until midnight AGAIN while she's here.

Band Camp starts in less than a month. I can't WAIT to get out of ""the nest"" again. I have been home for WAY too long.

Off to do nothing until 5...

"event","I am probably one of the least likely people to have my own LiveJournal. I mean, it only took me until the Spring Term of my Freshman year of college to get a FACEBOOK account. So yeah, Jaroni's making some great strides in the world of cyber gossip and profiling. I just hope it doesn't get out of hand (like FaceBook) and I start making entries like 30 times a day. It could happen, I suppose. Only if I am weak. Which I apparently am seeing as I just started up this account on a total whim on the suggestion of Marly. So...I guess that's that. I am officially an LJ-er. Starting now. Well, not yet. As soon as I finish this entry. Which hasn't happened yet. I...just...need...to...stop...writing...

AAAHHH!!!

It's taking hold! I can feel my life slipping into the cold, calculating clutches of my computer! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE, ONLINE DIARY?!?!

I've had an entire summer of upset, epiphanies, and loneliness (not to mention the LONG overdue commencement of an already WONDERFUL new relationship) all of which have gone totally undocumented. Oh well, maybe I'll catch up, or maybe I'll just go from here. At any rate, I am tired and need to stop typing. Now.

I'm Hooked!!!

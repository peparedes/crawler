"event","It appears my image hosting site wasn't making enough money, so now they are charging for external linking to hosted images.  That would explain why none of my pictures seem to be showing.  It looks as if I will have to find something new, but it's not as if I am killing their bandwidth with the massive amounts of people viewing my site on a daily basis. Maybe if I advertised on Yahoo with metatags like ""hot boy scout teenage William Shatner,"" I would actually understand why I need to pay a monthly charge for images.  As it is, right now you, my loyal readers, are getting screwed out of the beautiful culinary treats that make up the Gallery of Regrettable Foods.  And for that I apologize."

"event","It has been one of those nights where it has been frustrating to work.  The circulation staff have had more tough patron problems than they normally would in a week, and I had to spend 15 minutes erasing the work of a juvenile ""artist"" from one of our graphic novels.  Apparantly he thought it was amusing to draw a phallus on every single female in Neon Genesis Evangelion v.4, so I had to erase roughly 100 pages of penciled in work in the hopes that this item would be able to circulate again.  I think I was successful, but if I find out who it is you better believe I will bring down the law, I hate people who deface books, no matter how old they are.  Lousy Buggers.  

For lack of a better link here is a <a href=""http://www.lwhy.clara.net/nge/"">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a> website."

"event","Yesterday at work we had to share our favorite new children's book, mine was Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus, by Mo Willems.  If you are interested at all in children's literature, you must read this book, it is really good.  The illustrations are quite comical, yet evoke all the emotions they are intended to.  Check out his <a href=""http://www.mowillems.com/"">website</a>.

He does stuff for adults too, all you music nazi's out there should love this one:

I did just notice that Mo has problems spelling though, it's recommend, a common mistake!"

"event","I was listening to my internet radio doing work prep this morning and Diamanda Galas was played on the gothic station again, and it almost ruined my day.  I really cannot stand her music at all, if I had to describe it I would say imagine a cat being put through a meat grinder while still alive, and I think you have a good idea, and this from a person who thinks black and death metal are a great idea.  But the worst part of it is that her songs generally last for at least five to seven minutes, entirely too long to suffer through while waiting for the next song.  For every band they play that I like, it seems as if they have to play her five times.  Damn you Radio@Netscape plus!  

For information on the unlistenable darkwave diva, go to <a href=""http://www.diamandagalas.com/"">the homepage of Diamanda Galas</a>, and prepare to be aurally horrified."

"event","Sometimes I hate working with the public, namely when I get sick, lose my voice, and hack up ungodly amounts of phlegm.  I know it is a hazard of working with numerable people who carry all sorts of viruses, but it is still unpleasant.  So here are my themed links of the day:

www.vicks.com -Making me feel much better, even though their syrup tastes like ####!

I am looking forward to a weekend of housework, stripping paint, and visiting a friend who will be moving to Philly.  That really will be bittersweet because he had been out of work for a while, and finally got a good job, but he has been a great friend since I was in H.S., and a great gaming partner as well.  I'll miss him."

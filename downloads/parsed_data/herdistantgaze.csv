"event","you were in my dream last night. in my dream, i called you on the phone. it must've been important because i don't usually call you. i had something to say to you but i forgot in the midst of nervousness as the phone rang. and you answered and i looked like an idiot. i asked you if i could message you when i remember what i wanted to say and you said ""we're not really friends but sure."" that was when i told you that it wasn't how i wanted things. i told you that you were so wrapped up in your own heartache that you couldn't even see mine. i told you that i loved you but you couldn't see it because you were so in love with her. you weren't the only person who lost the one that they love that day. i wish i got to see how the dream ended but then i woke up. i wish i could tell you all the things i said in my dream and then some. but, sadly, this is the closest i'll ever get to telling you. who knows if you'll even stumble across this entry. but if you are reading this, i love you. and even if i can never ever hear your voice or hug you ever again, i just want you to know that. and i hope that you get everything you want out of your life."

"event","I saw this coming. I predicted it. So why am I bothered by it so much? I guess because no matter how much I prepare myself for let downs, it still hurts. Don't people understand that? How about a little common courtesy for christ's sake? Just be straight forward. It's not like I can't handle it. In fact, I'm sure I'll be over it in no time flat. But, seriously, JUST FUCKING TELL ME.

Though the sparkle is gone, the smile is in place so that everyone watching will see
You've got them all convinced, but I know so well
That you can list your friends, but you can't count on them


Careful now, you're so beautiful when you've convinced yourself
No one else is quite as beautiful"

"event","The highlight of tonight was John McHale writing ""stfu"" on my hand instead of the usual ""x"" haha. Oh, and seeing <i>him</i> again. It was just really good to see him even if he didn't want to talk to me.



But I guess I'll let the past be in the past and finally move on from all of that. I'm tired of the negativity and memories that make me miss something that I can never go back to.


It's nice to know I have someone there to make me smile from ear to ear. I sleep better at night now. :D"

"event","this whole adonis/mib business is ridiculous. seriously, it's time to get over it. people have opinions & we're all going to have to learn to live with it. do you honestly think that every single person is going to like your band? take the criticism and go with it. maybe you'll reach more fans that way. but if you want to be stubborn about it & hold a grudge that's fine too. just let it go. i'm sure there have been other people that don't care for your music. craig's only mistake was getting his words twisted around by some girl. i don't know this girl & i don't know her story but she claims that she didn't twist any words around. so i guess i'll give her the benefit of the doubt. craig is a friend of mine and he's probably one of the few truly good-hearted people i have met that are into hardcore music. i've spoken to him about this and he didn't even say it negatively, he stated his opinion and when you guys heard it and didn't like it, you freaked. take it as constructive criticism instead and try to accept the fact that not everyone is going to tell you that your band is 'rad'. as for turning people against him, that's just immature. there's no excuse for that. i only saw mib once and i don't even remember their sound and i've never heard adonis play so i'm not going to pass judgement on either band; it wouldn't be my place to do so anyway. but seriously, if you can't take the heat - get out of the business now because music producers would probably have a lot more to say than 'the lyrics suck.' (not saying that you guys are bad, just a general observation about how harsh the music industry can be). oh, and if there are any doubts in your mind about craig being grateful for hooking him up with his first show - erase them from your mind. because he is.

i'm sure i'll get bashed for this post but if i feel the need to speak my mind, i will. especially when you're bad mouthing one of my friends."

i wish that word would just go back to defining the contents of a portrait or the backdrop in a play. let's all be people again, instead of labels.

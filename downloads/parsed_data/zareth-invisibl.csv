Katy is upstairs writing in her journal because (silly child)&nbsp;she says she can only write properly lying down. I was going to write a long, drawn-out email to Tyler (I'm overdue), but reception is closed until 5pm (so I can't buy an Internet voucher), so instead I'm sitting out here in the glorious sun (like a clever child)&nbsp;writing in my journal as well, and drinking a cup (read: pot) of tea. I am totally addicted to tea!<br /><br />So, we are on the Isle of Arran, a beautiful island in the southwest of Scotland. It's known as &quot;Scotland in Miniature&quot;, and for good reason: in the 3-hour drive around the island, I have seen landscaped reminiscent of Northern Ontario, New Brunswick, Kluane National Park (Yukon), the Top of the World Highway (Yukon/Alaska), the Big Island (Hawaii), Galiano Island, Nanaimo, and ourvery own Pacific Northwest, jst to name a few. It's absolutely stunning - the only real difference is that I've never seen sheep roaming wild about the countryside in any of those places.<br /><br />We got here on Tuesday night, after a long but serendipitously well-connected voyage from Crewe (Ray and Judy's) via Glasgow. Yesterday we took buses almost all the way around the isle, including the inland sections (the Island is very mountainous, so most of the villages are on the coast). We meant to travel to Brodick first (about 40 min trip), it being the location of the only ATMs on the island and us down to 13pounds cash (Caitlin the Dumbass having misplaced the other 20-pound note (not a ood thing to lose - that's the equivalent of fifty Canadian dollars!), but unfortunately we missed our stop, not realizing that on school mornings that bus runs all the way to the highschool in Lmlash. So, wound up in Lamlash, with the next bus in either direction moer than an hour's wait. The thing you have to understand about Arran, too, is that when I use the term &quot;village&quot;, I mean VILLAGE. We're talking a cluster of 20-odd houses with, if you're lucky, a corner store (not that there are any corners, there being only one street), and a post office. Not the most enthralling place to be stuck for an hour and a half. Pretty, but no entertainment value. Once we finally escaped (deciding to continue forwards, since we'd already passed Brodick anyhow), we went to Whiting Bay (again pretty, again small, again an hour's wait), and walked along the beach - BLAH, SO&nbsp;DON'T WANT TO WRITE! - and then FINALLY&nbsp;arrived in Blackwaterfoot, hours after we left the hostel. Went (this was the original point) to Machrie Moor standing stones, which were much more like actual standing stones than the ones at Carnac - certainly <u>differently</u>&nbsp;impressive. What do you say about standing stones? they were big, and on end. Lol. I mean, really, you just have to see them in order to feel &quot;the full weight of hstory&quot;, etc etc. <br /><br />Man, I really need a new journal... Gawd, I am SO&nbsp;distractable today...it just feels like there's sooo much left to write about, and really there isn't...<br />Today was a horrible day from the outset (don't worry, though, it ends happily). We had planned to go on a hike from Whiting Bay, which led to the &quot;Giant's Grav&quot; and Glenashborough Falls, and (in a dramatic contraditiction of Murphy's Law&nbsp;- or so we thought) the sky was amazingly clear when we woke up, and the air was pleasantly warm with a light, cool breeze - perfect weather for a hike. At this point, of course, being the cynics we pretend we are, we should have Suspected Something. We did not, and this was our downfall.<br /><br />(1) We were going to phone Martina, and the phone card wouldn't work; (2) Katy got her period; (3) our soft-boiled eggs hard-boiled; (4) our kiwis were too unripe to eat; (5)&nbsp;we had a mad bus panis; (6) Katy developed horrendous cramps; (7) we lost a pound somewhere on the street; (8) upon entering the bus, we realized we had forgotten the extra camera battery; (9) and, upon further investigation, the camera itself; (10) in the exposed and unprotected kitchen cubbyhole; (11)&nbsp;<u>overnight</u>!... (12) And as we got of the bus in Whiting Bay, I forgot my blue cardigan on the seat, realizing it seconds too late... and (13)&nbsp;Katy's cramps became crippling.<br /><br />At about this point, we decided that the piling of crises had gone far enough, and we should split up.</lj-cut><br /><br /><strong>Friday, May 29th, 2004<br />NEWTON STEWART, MINNIGAFF HOSTEL<br /></strong><lj-cut text=""Sorry about that...I got distracted..."">Sorry about that...I got distracted, and then Katy came downstairs and started bitching about the sun, so the entry got aborted rather suddenly...but that's okay, I was getting bored with writing it anyhow, and its never a good idea to write when you're bored or tired, cause the writing always suffers for it. Anyway. So (to take a brief interlude from the previous and already interrupted subject) now we are in Newton Stewart (technically Minigaff, but it's the same thing essentially), staying at another SYHA&nbsp;Hostel with the most adorable owners and an incredibly friendly family feel. IT started raining this morning as we left Arran, and the weather's still looking fairly gloomy, but I figure after 2 weeks of beautiful weather we pretty much deserve it . The journey from Arran to NS&nbsp;took entirely too long (over 10 hours!!)&nbsp;because we had to take a rather circuitous route involvign backtracking nearly to Glasgow from Ardrossan (the mainland pier)&nbsp;and then changing trains and waiting for busses in various small towns, including a three-hour wait in Ayr and an hour's wait in Stranraer. When we finally got to NS, we realized we had no idea where the hostel was otehr than a vague suspicion that it was across the bridge in Minnigaff (hence the name)...however, we eventually found a friendly policeman, and he pointed us in the right direction, and here we are. <br /><br />SO. Back to the crises of yesterday...briefly, we solved them thus:<br />Katy and I, as I said, decided to go our separate ways. She would make her painful way back to the Hostel, there to write in her journal, find out what she could about Lost and Found items on the busses, organize our stuff, and just generally spend as much time in a fetal position as is possible for a post-natal human being, while I, who was not in pain and really really wanted to do this hike, would go it alone and return to the hostel following my adventure. Seemed like a good solution, so we divvied up the food, argued over possession of the watch (it wasn't actually much of an argument truth be told - I said, &quot;Oh no, we only have one watch,&quot;&nbsp;and she took it off and handed it to me, but stil...), and separated.<br /><br />And I must say I think I definitely got the better end of this deal, although Katy may tell you differently. The hike really was fabulous...the landscape actually reminded me very much of home, which was nice (I couldn't decide whetehr it was more like Terrace Mountain or the walk to Gruchy's Beach), adn as I have said the weather was amazing. It was also really nice just to be finally actually moving and exerting myself, and to be able to move at my own pace - something I don't get to do very often since everybody always wants either to go slower or faster than I do; I've never really hiked on my own before, unless you count the Cottage and the area around Terrace. It was also a lot less dangerous than any walking a person might want to do around our area, since there are no bears or other dangerous wildlife and there were just the right number of people on the path - enough that you run into them every ten minutes or so so you dont' get worried about being All Alone In The Woods, but not so many that it ruins your illusions of solitude. The walk to the Giant's Graves only took about 15 minutes, although there were 330 steps (the guidbook only advertized 26...grr!&nbsp;I hate step!), and it was pretty, but unspectactular. The forest glade there were set in was very nice, and I would have taken pictures if I'd had the camera, cause the &quot;graves&quot; tehmselves (massive stone blocks forming inexplicable grave-shaped depressions in the ground) were quite interesting, but I'm not entirely sure that everyone would consider it to be worth the fuss. <br /><br />The falls, however (I think, upon further consideration, that the name was Glenash<u>dale</u>) were quite lovely, adn I think anyone would agree. I mean, the thing about waterfalls is that they tend to look a lot like waterfalls (wow, deep), but they <u>were</u>&nbsp;very nice, and I just couldn't (and subsequently didn't) resist clambering around on the rocks at the top, and getting even more sunburnt. The patches of clearcutting did not add to the view particularly, but the various random and inexplicable bits of old stone houses, walls, and forts [that] you kep tstumbling over int he most unexpected places certainly did. Confused one old couple quite a bit by passing them about four times in a row...they simply couldn't figure out how I kept winding up behind them again, but it was because I repreatedly got sidetracked and wandered off the main trail to explore...the more extreme of these incidents was actually after the forest path had reemerged onto a road leading back down into town (Whiting Bay), when I took off up some unfenced meadows into the hills&nbsp;- that particular sidetrack took about half an hour, but the view of the bay from the top was definitely worth it! Singing of &quot;The Hills are Alive With the Sound of Music&quot;&nbsp;was perhaps undertaken at this juncture.<br /><br />When I finally got down to the main road and caught a bus back to Brodick Pier to transfer to a bus for the hostel, I found Katy still there, sitting and waiting at the pier!&nbsp;Turns out that after she separated from me and caught a bus to Brodick that morning, she had found that the next bus to Lochranza didn't actually leave&nbsp;until 2:30...by which time I had caught up with her!&nbsp;In the interim she bought a ridiculously-cute little notebook and the blueberry-scented gell pen I was writing with yesterday from the TIC (Tourist Information Centre) at the pier, and had spent the day doodling and writing note to Martina. This is why I say I got the better end of the deal - I got to go on a wonderful hike and see things I will maybe never have the chance to see again, and she got a blueberry-flavoured pen and a sunburn (zeugma?).<br /><br />It is, by the way, a testament both to the smallness of that island and the friendliness of its people that I did get my cardigan back after all. There are only&nbsp;about five bus drivers total, and they switch buses every so often so you get to know all of them in the course of a day... Katy talked at length to the driver who brought her to Brodick, and between him and the driver of the bus I left it on, the cardigan arrived at the pier about the same time I did, and made it back into my hands just when I thought it had gone forever. In fact, a lady came up to Katy on that bus and asked if 'her friend had left her sweater on the bus for Whiting Bay'. Small world - no; small island. There was this couple from Birmingham, for example, who were staying at the Lochranza Hostel with us, and we must have bumped into them five different times in various places on the island. Likewise with ayoungish fellow who checked into the hostel the same night we did, whom we ran into the next day in Blackwaterfoot of all places. It was quite funny. <br /><br />Incidentally, the camer (forgtooen about that, had you?) survived its ordeal (god bless honest/incurious backpackers!) and we emailed Tuna...<br />Lol.. will talk about the awful monopoly game another time - need sleep now. Cannot wait to get to Wigtown as my need for a new journal grows increasingly desperate...<br />Love Caitlin.</lj-cut><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, May 29, 2004<br /></strong><lj-cut text=""A few more people staying in our room tonight..."">A few more people staying our room tonight, but thankfully they aren't early risers and don't need the lights out right away, so I'll fill in a little bit more before going to bed.<br />...Hmm, or not, since Katy has just talked my ear off for the past 25 minutes and now our roommates are back...and I mean, really, after all this time what can we possily have to talke about? Lol, yep, you guessed it...boys. *L*&nbsp;Not THE&nbsp;boys, this time, but Paul, and Uzzie, and nostalgia...anyway, I'll try to catch up tomorrow. *sigh* I'm not even tired...hate dorms. Lol. G'night!<br />Love Caitlin</lj-cut><br /><br /><strong>Sunday, May 30/04<br /></strong><lj-cut text=""So let's try this again, shall we?"">So let's try this again, shall we? I've had to tear myself away from my book (well, books, actually - I'm currently in the middle of <u>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</u>, <u>Soul Music</u> ( a Discworld novel), and Shakespeare's <u>Twelfth Night&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;which is actually a bit dull, truth be told...I have to say that I generally like his tragedy etter than his comedy - and often think if funnier, besides, lol. They're all interesting but not totally gripping books, so I've been switching off-and-on between them...this being just one of the perils encountered in a town full of second-hand bookshops...oops, that was a rather longer aside than strictly necessary, considering I was going to tlak about all this stuff anyway...lol) in order to write, and furthermore it's becoming almost impossible to see the lines of the book in this waning light (yes I'm aware that I could simply go and turn on the lisghts, but I twisted my ankle quite badly this afternon and eyesight is just not worth climbing down the ladder of a bunkbed to save...), so I'll brook no complaints if I wander off topic during this entry - I've earned it.!<br /><br />So, to catch up, as usual... Yesterday, for practically the first time since we came to Britain, it rained. (I say practically because it did *technically* rain - torrentially - for about half an hour the day we went to Chester; however, considering the weather we'd been warned to expect in Britain and considering that we spend the majority of that half hour in a toy shop anyhow, we can't really complain). We started out the morning be heading to Castle Douglas, which is a town (not a castle) about an hour's bus ride from Newton Stewart that was hosting a festival that day that the manager here (Richard, by name recommended to us. Food is to Castle Douglas what books are to Wigtown (yes, literally - it's called &quot;Scotland's National Foodtown&quot;) and it was a food festival. Unfortunately the festival proper wasn't scheduled to start until 11am and we got there at 9, with the result that we spend a couple of rainy hours in what is actually a fairly dreary little town, ate breakfast at a little cafe (genuine &quot;fruit&quot; - read:&nbsp;raisin - scones and mochas with foam:&nbsp;6 pounds), and then left at five past 11, just before the festivities actually started. This turned out to be a mistake, as the weather cleared about an hour later, and fold who stayed said it was great fun. <em>Tant pis</em>: we went to Wigtown.<br /><br />Wigtown is awesome. How could a town known for its second-hand bookshops NOT&nbsp;be awesome? We decided, in an effort to restrain ourselves, that we should hold off buying anything until we had checked out all fo the bookstores in the town and compared prices - I realize that this ruins the spontaneity of the venture somewhat, but we are practically Starving Students, after all. Unfortunately, the Clever Plan backfired somewhat, since by the time we got to the last shop (<em>Transformer</em>, nearly two miles out of town as it turns out, but boasting <strong>the largest collection of secondhand sci-fi and fantasy n the UK</strong> - who could pass it up?) we were practically slavering...plust the lady who runs it was completely marellous (her name was Carol, before I forget, and she was about 45 years old with bright pink hair...) and the collection of books, stacked in heaps in boxes, staircases, and on the floor where they spilled off the shelves, was trulye awe-inspiring. ...We wound up spending nearly 20 pounds there, which is about fifty Canadian dollars... however, some of those were books I've been searching for for a long time, such as <u>Songmaster</u> and a replacement copy of <u>Macroscope</u>. Anyway. We felt justified.<br /><br />Today we got a ride to the Isle of Whithorn with Richard (the hostel manager, ou remember) and his wife, Primrose. It was extremely friendly of them&nbsp;- they were headed there anyway for a Sunday 'tea' of some sort, and took us by several little towns on the way ... buses are great things and I appreciate their services, but it's quite wonderful to be shown around a place by the people who know and love it. They also took us to their &quot;typical Scottish house&quot; in Whithorn, which was completely stunning. It's adjacent to the Bank of Scotland, and it used to be the bank manager's residence, apparently; beautiful wooden annisters and ten foot ceilings, it was wonderful. The attic room was especially neat, accessed by a tiny spiral staircase... it was really very nice of them to show us around. We spent the afternoon (the arly part of it at any rate) basking in the sun, which shone with renewed vigour after its day off, on the Isle of Whithorn, which is actualy a part of the peninsula now although it used to be an island. It is apparently the start of yet another pilgrimmage route (although we didn't see any shells this time), so we walked to the headland to look at St Ninian's Chapel, only to become confused as to whether it was in fact the collapsing old stone house or the whitewashed and oddly cuibcal lighthouse which personified the holy place... REgardless, however, the headland itself was beautiful, and a great spot for a picnic...<br /><br />On the way back to the bus stop I twisted my ankle rather severely, and although it certainly isn't officially sprained (not nearly swollen enough), it is also not particularly pleasant to walk on, and I'm afraid I've been being a bit of a bab about it all evening...but that's okay, cause Katy's been complaining about her hip again, too, so we can be invalids together...<br />Hmm, I appear to be rather drastically running out of pages in this book...I looked for a replacement while we were in Wigtown, but I'm so spoiled aobut bindings now, and all they had were spiral-bound books with butterlies on them for far too much money (nearly as much as I spent on this one, if you will believe it), which I simply couldn't accept...however, in light of new circumstances which have recently come to light (ie the end of the book?)&nbsp;I may have to just swallow my pride and buy one, since any journal (almost)&nbsp;would be better than no journal at all...<br /><br />Hmm, and I should like to fill all of this space, since it is after all here in front fo me, but what does one say when faced with such a void? <em>So long, and thanks for all the fish. </em>Gawd, another cliceh. Just when you thought you were free...<br />&nbsp;<br />(Tyler, Tyler, Tyler).<br /><br />Love, Caitlin.</lj-cut>"

Even though it's really late, </em>I have to get up tomorrow, and I'm very tired, I'm strung out and out of sorts, and I suspect that even though the act of writing takes up valuable sleeping time, the benefits gained from its therapeutic value will outweigh the detriments.<br />I shouldn't have ever considered working at a place that's open 24/7. It's stupid. Not only do I never have free nights (and therefore no times off which correspond with anyone else), but also, as someone with no seniority, I have to work holidays - which means, for example, that I'm working Thanksgiving Monday, and it also means I'll probably have to work Christmas - a prospect which is already upsetting me deeply.<br />It also means I never get enough sleep, cause I need to be up early enough to accomplish things before work, and it means that either I don't get ot hang out with people or else that I abuse myself in order to do it- cause I don't have weekends, and everyone else does.<br />*Self-pitying sigh*. I don't know why everything's bothering me so much this evening. I hate my life. I resent Katy's. I resent <em>Katy</em>, for not appreciating what she has. I miss regularity.<br />I miss Tyler.<br />I'm insanely attracted to Mark Biagioni. Again. Still. Why?!!<br /><br />Caitlin.<br /></div><br />Tuesday, Oct 7/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""I'm so paranoid and protective of this journal now, after what happened with the airlines this summer.""><em>I'm so paranoid and protective of this journal now, after what happened with the airlines this summer. </em>I didn't mean to write tonight at all, but I looked ont he shelf for this book when I lay down, and it wasn't there. I knew where it was - it was in the backpack I took with me to Vancouver - but I had this sudden insane thought that perhaps I'd left it on the plane or in the hotel. Not that I could do anything about it at 2 o'clock on a Wednesday morning even if I had, but I had to check all the same. And it was there - obviously - and now I'm writing. And have just taken up twelve lines to say that - it's no wonder I fill this book so quickly.<br /><br />I really needed to talk to Tyler tonight and he wasn't home. As I said when I emailed him, I suppose that's only fair; after all, I'm practically never here when he calls me. But I needed him so much tonight, and I'm not sure why. I think its partly having been in Vancouver - it's frustrating to be so near and so far.<br />Katy and I got served alcohol at the Earl's in Vancouver. This was a big thrill. We were with Mum, and they seated us in the bar and gave us Margaritas without even questioning. :p It was kinda cool, in a juvenile look-at-us-we're-big-kids-now kind of way! We were in Vancouver buying Europe supplies at MEC. Plans are progressing comfortably - we now have most of the required big-ticket items and our relatives in France (me) and England (Katy) have been contacted. We aren't planning to leave until April still, but it's nice to feel like we have things more or less under control. Now all we need is to suffer through the next six months - and to accumulate money - and for Katy to not have her passport application rejected - that process is so irritating!&nbsp;<br />*Yawn* And I guess I also need to be sure to try to wrap up this journal by then as well so I don't have to lug it to Europe and back...only seventy-four pages left!<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div><br />Thursday, October 9/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Seems like all you've been getting lately is job complains and missing Tyler, but really that's all that's been going on.""><em>Seems like all you've been getting lately is job complains and missing Tyler, but really that's all that's been going on.</em> Bitched extensively in Livejournal today about job/music/life in general, so I really don't feel like complaining in here again - and besides, I feel significantly better having talked to Tyler; this afternoon, though, I was in really bad shape. Everything's random, and I feel constantly stressed and out of control. Suffice it to say, my life sucks.<br />Talking to Tyler really does help though. It's so nice to be loved. I miss my family - with my work schedule the way it is (mostly evenings) I never see them - I literally haven't eaten dinner here in over a week, closer to two. I hate it - at least Tyler give me some emotional stability, even if it is long distance.<br />Have worked 14 hours in the last 24, and am really, really, shaky tired. Don't really know why I started writing in the first place. What I need is sleep. And stability.

Smack me. I've got butterflies in the pit of my stomach that have nobusiness being there.<br />I have a crush on Mark Biagioni. Did I just say those words? I did. I don't want to - except that I do, which is why I do, which is why I don't, even though that sentence would make no sense to anyone except possibly Katy. I have a crush on Mark Biagioni. That's all it is - a crush. I don't like him...particularly...I mean, I don't DISLIKE him, but he's shallow and sex-oriented and there's really no way around that. I have absolutely no interest in a relationship with him. I love Tyler. I mean that. If I'm seriously considering spending the rest of my life with him, trust me, I'm serious.<br />But Mark is here. And Mark is easy - that is, he requires no effort or emotional involvement, just casual flirting. Which in and of itself would be easy enough to ignore, except he flirts back. I wound up in a chair with him tonight watching a movie - not doing anything, just sitting. But at this point, physical contact of any sort feels pretty much like flirting.<br />And I really am physically attracted to him. Kind of like Jon Rife...sort of. He's ADORABLE. He's got wonderful hair. He's also two years younger than me (did I mention that?) Don't worry, if you're starting to. Nothing is going to happen, and again, I don't say that without meaning it. I know where my lines are, and we aren't near them, nor are we likely to get closer to them. Not only do we hardly ever see Mark, but I wouldn't let things get into a situation where it could go any further. It's very casual.<br />So why do I feel so bloody guilty?<br />A bewildered Caitlin.<br /></div><br />Saturday, Oct 25/03 (Fall Back!)<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Talked to Tyler this evening, and now feel much more how, as it were.""><em>Talked to Tyler this evening, and now feel much more how, as it were. </em>Lol, essentially, I got the Official Go-Ahead on my flirtations with Mark.

And it's funny how much better I feel, having told him that. It was meaningless before and it's meaningly now - but now it doesn't feel so...hidden, and Questionable.<br /><br />Anyway. Need to sleep. Try to write tomorrow.<br />Happy daylight savings time. :)<br />Love Caitlin.<br /></div>"

Really tired, of course, but feel I should write, however briefly.</em> I miss Tyler. Well, there's a new one. When you're bored sometime, try counting the number of entries since September of last year that he HASN'T been in. My guess is eight, and that's being generous. I've got a quote for you from a November livejournal which pertains to missing Tyler, but I'm not going to put it in right now. That would take WAY too long.<br />Blah. Worked eight hours today, work seven tomorrow. I really hate the way my life is right now. I know it's a job, and it's good money, and as menial labour goes it's not that bad, but...ehh. Blah. I just...I need structure, I need a schedule. I don't do well with this inconsistant 4-hours-there-and-5-here shit. It's really hard. Much as routine has its drags, it sure beats this. The irregularity puts me constantly on edge, and it's funny, cause when I'm actually at work I usually enjoy myself - it's when I'm off that I feel lost. I can see time slipping through my fingers, but I feel powerless to stop it. The time I have never seems long enough to DO anything in, and meanwhile it whittles away and I've practiced my piano twice and my voiice once and done no History at all. I need direction, and I need to schedule my time in order to accomplish things, and that's so tough to do when you don't know day to day what'll be asked of you.<br />*Sigh* I miss Tyler. Having him back for a while would be a big help. And twist the clock back to Grade Eleven - or forward to March - while you're at it!<br />Smudges, Caitlin.<br /></div><br />Wednesday, Sept 24/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""So go figure. I have Strep Throat again.""><em>So go figure. I have Strep Throat again. </em>Right on schedule. *SIGH* Shoulda taken more Vitamin C...I <em>knew</em> working in the Food Service Industry was risky!At least I caught it quick. Woke up yesterday with rebellious tonsils and decided to give them 24 hours to decide what they were doing. Worse this morning, so I went to Dr Burilowski, and she put me on penicillin straight off, which hopefully means it was caught soon enough that it won't cause much trouble. I don't work again til Saturday, so fingers crossed...Hoping for a speedy recovery, Kits!<br />I appear to have stumbled back into this X-files obsession. Katy and I have been watching what few videos they have available here, and we've gotten up to Season Four, which is when I started watching. In my (biased) opinion, Seasons 4&amp;5 were the best in the show - right in the middle when it was secure in its stride and still had interested actors, and interesting plots. They were able to take risks and develop the Mythology, but they hadn't degraded to bringing in bad Duchovny substitutes and rnning ridiculous plots. After Season Six it really wasn't worth watching, and after Season Seven I didn't, except the last episode. I mean, really, half the point of thhe show was the romantic tension between Scully and Mulder - stick Dogett in there and you lose the spark entirely. There were a few good ideas left hanging around, but really, they shoul dhave just called it quits when Duchovny did.<br />Anyway, I've been looking up episode synopses and transcripts from Season 4&amp;5, cause we're almost out of episodes on video and the movie doesn't come in until after Season 5. And there's so much I'd forgotten! Wow. It was so weird to have it all come flooding back with just these vague synopses and keywords. So odd.<br />Really wish the series on DVD didn't cost $75 per season!<br />Anyway...I ramble. G'night, Kitty.<br />Sick smudges.<br /></div><br />Thursday, Sept 25/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text="""" bad="""" of="""" sign="""" usually="""" is="""" conscience="""" clear="""" a=""""><em>""A clear conscience is usually a sign of a bad memory.""<br /></em>So. X-Files. Gawd, how did I ever let myself get involved in this mess again? This obsession. IT'S OVER! And I didn't even bother to WATCH the last two seasons. Really, out of a nine-season show, I only ever watched four seasons; that's less than half.<br />But Gawd. I loved those characters. Love those characters. They're fucking imaginary figures, but I cared so much about them. I was eleven and they promised me everything. And somehow, they still do. Today I downloaded the last episode of the show, ""The Truth"", the end of the Ninth season. I didn't even know there <em>was</em> a ninth season 0 I had thought the series ended with that kiss at the end of the eighth. I called it quits there. And really, I still don't have any se for the episodes that don't have Mulder. That show, for me at least, WAS Scully and Mulder. That relationship. I wasn't in love with David Duchovny (if anything, I was more attracted to Nicholas Lea, the guy who plays Alex Krycek); I was in love with Scully&amp;Mulder. I was in love with love. With romance - with need and passion unrealized.<br />And I still am. I miss Tyler - desperately - but what I miss sometimes more is Tyler Before. Before we started going out. Before we said ""I love you"" like we took it forgranted. Before everything was a sure thing. No matter what the situation, nothing attracts me like desperation and need...desires half-admitted and promises almost fulfilled. I[t] took me a while to understand that romance and love aren't the same thing. Love is placid; love is prosaic. I love Tyler. I love talking ot him, I love bein gwith him, I love touching him. It's comfortable. It's nice. It's frustrating at the moment with him in bloody Nanaimo, but it's something you can count on, you know? It's secure.<br />But comfort isn't romance. And I hate to admit it, but it's a bit boring. Where's the danger, the uncertainty, the THRILL? People stay married for eighty years - but where's the tension? Where's the squeezing in your chest and the tingle in your palms when he hugs you spontaneously in the A&amp;W parking lot and you think, Wow, could he really like me?<br />Don't take this wrong. I'm not about to break up with Tyler and go off on a quest for adventure. But I can't help wondering if this is it. I'm eighteen. What if I marry Tyler and live happily ever after? Will I never feel that emotional turmoil again in a non-vicarious medium? Or is there a way to take this for-granted affection, spice it up and make me thrill at it again? There must be. And then again, maybe I just need to see him...<br />*L, and maybe I'm just sick and overwrought. That's always a possibility too! :p<br />G'night, Kitty. Love you... <br /></div>"

That's not what I mean, but...well, it's like, there's no need or reason to miss him, because he doesn't exist in real life anyhow. He exists solely as a voice on the other end of the telephone line. And then sometimes I need him so badly.<br />Katy is leaving for Telegraph Creek tomorrow - unless she isn't. She was initially supposed to leave last Saturday (yes, a week and a half ago), and her Dad's been putting it off further and further since.

I've worked 3-8 hours every day since Monday - started being Official yesterday. Today was the busiest it's been, but yesterday was the most fun - I got to be a server. That's WAY more interesting, plus you get tips! I made $16 in tips last night in four hours, which isn't bad at all. Today I just did hostessing, which really isn't nearly as much fun. You don't get to interact as much with people, you don't get as much money, and there's a lot less work to keep you occupied. There's nothing worse than trying to look busy even when there's nothing left to do, trust me. You welcome the chance to fill sugars and bus tables! I swear, folding napkin and cutlery packages was the highlight of my day!<br /><br />I really miss Tyler right now, these last couple days. I need him. Here. Physical presence. Christ, it's only the middle of September! He's only been gone two fucking weeks. The time's gone by quick within that period (I swear it was Monday last time I turned around), but it feels like tow MONTHS. And it's officially our seven-month anniversary today. Isn't that sad? And even so, I STILL keep track. Silly Caitlin. Well, after all, if I can't be foolish and girly in a private journal, than wehre <em>can </em>I do it?<br /><br />Need sleep.

Now, it's the eighteenth. Why, you ask, has she been so very remiss in her journalistic (for lack of a better word) duties, particularly when she is on holidays and has therefore no stressful education-related concerns to lure her away?<br />Well, I shall tell you - as briefly as I am able given the typically-narrative style of my writing as well as its current unaccustomed verbosity for which I apologise profusely - I have been reading Robertson Davies, you see. At any rate, the point of the sentence (which, in my verbal meanderings, I never actually arrived at) was that I am - as usual - tired, and therefore attempting, despite all appearances to the contrary, to be brief. :)<br /><br />My bag missed its flight. Brief enough for you? Those damnable fold-up scissors again. They turn up absolutely everywhere, and I never notice them until it's too late. They were in my overnight kit, which was in my carryon bag, because I never leave toiletries in my checked luggage in case it gets lost in transit (!!). This was particularly ironic considering that earlier that morning I had already removed from that bag not only my Swiss Army knife, but also my pencil sharpener (!!) in case they had a problem with it. Didn't notice the scissors.<br />Not, of course, that a pair of one-and-a-half inch nail scissors could possibly do anybody any particular harm anyway. (Any any any). I mean, you could do just as much damage with a sharpened PENCIL as you could with one of those things, for crying out loud! Oh great, now they'll read this and decide to ban pencils! But anyway...I suppose you have to draw the line somewhere, right? And they chose to draw it before my scissors. My choice (this was in the Kelowna airport, boarding - or rather not boarding - our WestJet flight to Hamilton) was to dispose of the scissors or check my carryon bag. Yes, yes, I know. In retrospect, those scissors weren't really so terribly important. Hindsight's 15/20. (Or else it's 20/15 - I can never remember which is the number that changes. Anyway.)<br />So I took out my book and my discman, and checked the backpack...and have been without my toiletries, my camera, or my journal (among other things) for a week.<br />Moral of the story? ...Next time, lose the scissors.<br />Gnight, luv.

At least I finished it though, so that particular brand of foolishness cannot be repeated. But I feel the need to write in this journal, so it might be two before I go to sleep...oh well.<br />I'm a lot better than I was last time you heard from [me]. Two days and a lot of chickflicks are good therapy for a heart that has been ""like gold to airy thinness beat."" =p *is a nerd* I interrupted the previous segment of this entry cause Katy came to interrupt me - or rather, to rescue me from that messy business of wallowing in self-pity. We watched <em>Ever After</em>, drove around Lakelse Lake (almost literally) and went to Mike's going-away party (he's moving to Vancouver to attend a dance academy), which was actually a lot more fun than I expected it to be. I hadn't seen people in a long time and it was fun to have a chance to talk to everyone. I even missed TRAVIS! Now <em>that's </em>saying something! I got bored and antisocial (and tired - did I mention Tyler and I only got about 2 hours of sleep on Thursday night?), but managed to have fun anyway: Barry entertained me, and I had a bit of a conversation with Britt's guy, Stefan, who's also from Rupert. He's a <u>really</u> nice guy.<br />So, at any rate I've been keeping busy. It's still bothering me, though - Tyler's gone. I'm not sure I've quite registered FOUR MONTHS yet. Once Katy's not here to help distract me it'll probably sink in. Even as it is, though, I've been in a lot of inexplicably bad moods over the last couple days, and I suspect that's the result of combined upset and stress about the prospect of getting a job. I do hope not to get quite so distraught again as I was on Friday - I'd say I was sorry, but then, I suppose that listening to melodramatic outpourings is your job, isn't it, Kitty? And anyway, it can't be any worse than a lot of the other drivel I've written in here. Lol, Tyler says this journal [is] very silly and teeny-bopper-ish, and I suppose he's right. It's my vent for releasing thoughts and emotions I consider too petty/juvenile/ridiculous to actually voice aloud. At heart, there is, unfortunately, a part of me that really truly is a teenager. If I'm not allowed to be ridiculous in here, then where can I?<br />At any rate, that outburst on Friday was nevertheless uncommon for me. I was just feeling so trapped and upset...it was likely a combination of tiredness, stubbornness, and the fact that we really did not have a very satisfactory goodbye - he was in such a hurry by the time we got to the airport that there wasn't any time...my MOTHER said goodbye to him more thorouhgly than I did!&nbsp;<br />But it's water under the bridge.<br />Going to sleep...and it's only quarter to 2!<br />Goodnight, 'hon. Lovelorn smudges. :)<br /></div>"

They're sitting there, and after a while, one says to the other, ""My it's getting hot in here"" and the other one says, ""Ahh, a talking muffin!""<br />Lol, a drunk person told me that joke last night. He thought he was very funny. Actually, he was - but we were laughing more at him than the joke!<br /><br />I've been very remiss with this journal - mostly cause Tyler's been here, but that's still no excuse.<br />I've officially graduated now. Ceremony was on Friday. I am never going to be a highschool student again - isn't that scary?! I think so. It's so weird to think about. Being out. Being done. Gawd. I've been doing this forever.<br />The Dry Grad party was fun - way better than Prom. It was very well organized, well-supplied, and well-run. It was set up like a carnival, with booths and games and prizes. Free food nd free stuff - what more can you ask for, right?! Anything that can keep <em>me</em> entertained until 5am is a pretty skookum outfit, though, is all I've got to say.<br />Ooh, and I got my Class 5 license! That means I'm a fully qulaified driver and I don't have to wear a stupid ""N"" on my tail anymore. I took my test for it last Thursday. Apparently I need to stop further behind the stop lines - but my observation skills are great! And he didn't even test any of the things I was worried about - parallel parking, tire position when parking on hills, and the functional capabilities of my parking break (which are less than stellar.) It was great.<br />My grandparents - Dad's parents, that is, not Nana and Papa - have been up for about a week; they're leaving tomorrow. I love them, but they're tough to be around. I never know what to do around them; I'm always on edge.<br />Tyler's looking for a job in Terrace over the summer. He needs money for university next year, and there's no work in Rupert. Not that the odds are much better here, but there are some opportunities. If he moves here, he'll be living with Katy, in the other half of her parents' basement suite. THAT should be an interesting experience!<br />G'night Kitty. :)<br /></div><br />Monday, July 7th/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""I've just left my boyfriend at my best friend's house for the night - for  the summer, actually.""><em>I've just left my boyfriend at my best friend's house for the night - for&nbsp; the summer, actually.</em> It's a most peculiar feeling. Tyler managed to get a job here (finaly) at the College, as a library assistant. He starts tomorrow - and he also, officially, starts living at Katy's house.He's renting the other half of her basement suite - I'm not sure if I told you. They're giving him a really great deal; he's only paying a hundred dollars a month, plus food, which amounts to barely anything in relative terms. It's a great thing for him...that is, if they can make it work.<br />Katy and Tyler have been having issues - I'm fairly positive I told you that. They're mostly sorted out for the moment, but there's always this degree of tension between them, so it will be very interesting to see if they can survive living together for two months without murderin geach other. I'm afraid it's going to strain all of our relationships, but if they can survive it, I think it will be good for both of them...and maybe even myself as well.<br />It's weird from my perspective though, undoubtedly. I didn't think having him living there would bother me, and it doesn't exactly, per se. I mean, he spends a lot more time NOT here than he does at my house - but always before, when he's not been here he's been in Rupert. Now, it's different, somehow. It's odd to leave him down the street at Katy's house, to not have him here and know that he's only two blocks away. I'm not used to him being inTerrace and not being <u>with me</u>. It doesn't seem fair...I know that it IS fair, of course, plus I don't get nearly enough sleep at night or enough things accomplished during the day when he's here.<br />If nothing else, it'll be an interesting process, to say the least.<br />G'night, Kitty. :)<br /></div><br />Thursday, July 10th/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Oof.

Isn't that terrifying?! I'm older than Rolf! Aren't I supposed to become mature or wise or something at some point? As usually, this does not feel dundamentally any different from being seventeen. Eighteen does at least create some milestones, though. Aside from the fact that I am now officially my own person in the eyes of the law, I can also vote in municipal and provincial (but not federal) elections, rent pornography, and buy alcohol in Alberta. Two of these prospects are considered particularly appealing to the teenage populace in general - guess which two!Katy, Tuna, Lowell, and I are leaving on our Jasper Adventure on Sunday - I fully expect the next two days to be insane!<br /><br />Entrepid smudges.

I'm sure this is our fault somehow, but I can't decide whether it's because we decided to go on a hike today or because I forgot to bring my gortex. Katy says we also mustn't forget about the fact that we prematurely packed the sandwiches for the hike last night, and left our last piece of paper out in the open by the firepit. I think these trangressions should have been countered by the fact that I zipped up the vestibule of the tent in case it rained, but I guess it wasn't enough...<br /><br />Sorry - it's now the (late) evening of Thursday July 17th, and we're having a Journal Writing session. This evening has been...eventful. In a talking-about-guys way. David and Chris, mostly...Katy's guys.<br />*sigh* Think I'm going to have to stop again. We're almost done our Adventure! Tomorrow is our last real day; we're going to the Hotsprings, and then Saturday we're leaving. I think we're taking two day sto come home so we can look at second-hand bookstores in PG.<br />Try to write again before returnign home.

Surprise. :p It was fun, though. It's a neat feeling to be genuinely fending for yourself. We took two days coming back - stayed with KT's Aunt and Uncle in PG and looked around at 2nd-hand-book stores in the area. Found some neat books!<br />Anyway. We've been back since Sunday night, and I've been busy enjoying my two weeks of Summer At Home before we're off again (next Friday) to Skyline and Cammac (with Mum and Dad, respectively.) Somehow this summer seems way shorter than last summer (already!) although really, I'm spending almost exactly the same amount of time away. It's odd. I'm enjoying having Tyler in town, although balance issues with Katy have been borderline weird. It's extremely odd having them both living in the same space. I'm going to miss Tyler A LOT when he leaves in the fall - remind me to go into my speculations on THAT front another time...<br /><br />And I have GOT to get over this Obsession! ( I know this seems like a jump, but it makes sense in my head.) Up until Grade 6, it made sense. In grades 7 &amp; 8, when I had no friends anyhow, I can understand clinging to the vestiges. But why is my subconscious still Obsessed with Brad?! It's ridiculous! Eventually, I'm gonna have to write to him or SOMETHING...find a way of putting this ghost to rest. In the past two weeks, I've had two vivid, powerful, emotional, and very romantic dreams about him. WHY? It's like this book that I never finished reading - I've mostly forgotten the plot by now, and it's completely irrelevant to the rest of my life, and it <u>SHOULDN'T MATTER</u>, but I still can't help wondering what happened, even though even if I now had that information, it would no longer make sense to me. Oh, nevermidn. It's just so SILLY, that's all. I had that crush in Grade 6, and yet I've just graduated highschool and I still can't help dwelling on it. Am I pathetic or what?!<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div><br />Sunday, July 27th<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Bleached my hair and dyed it blue today.""><em>Bleached my hair and dyed it blue today. </em>Yes, I'm serious.

I think the most interesting thing will be to see how adults whom I don't know treat me - whether their attitude changes as a result of the colour of my hair. Lol, maybe I should keep a travelogue of my encounters. I'll call it ""Blue Like Me."" Yes, I know that was terrible. Sorry.<br /><br />Better go. Blue smudges, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

I'm just too damned inhibited!<br />Last weekend was Prom. (No, we didn't have sex, that's not what I mean. Why is Prom night always associated with sex anyways? It's so stupid...) Tyler came up of course, as did Martina. It was kind of lame - the parading around in dresses &amp; getting hair done &amp; taking pictures beforehand was way more fun than the actual dinner and dance. That was...well, a lot like a school dance. Loud, mostly. Tyler and I discovered that we really can't dance together, not properly. When I was wearing high heels it sort of works, but otherwise it was totally useless.<br />I'm very weird about kissing in public. I hate it. It embarasses me - I'm SO inhibited! Gah. But it's not even that, it's like...I dunno, like I don't want to make <u>other</u> people uncomfortable. Lol, despite the fact that everyone else does it! Tyler kept trying to kiss me, and I kept shying away.<br />After we left the Prom it was more fun. We went to Katys', and some people drank while others of us laughed at them. There was an actual after-party at Josh Foot's house which got broken up by the cops at 3:30, but I had absolutely no desire to go to that.<br />I'm so weird about alcohol. I really can't figure me out. I honestly wish that it would just cease to exist. It's not that I desire alcohol, I don't - I don't even LIKE it - it's just that it makes me massively resentful whenever other people are drinking, because I can't. My only experiences with alcohol have been either totally ineffective in terms of changing my character, or else completely miserable. I've never been successfully drunk - or buzzed, or tipsy, or whatever. I've been sober, and I've been sick. That's it.<br />And I hate it. If anyone needs to loosen up, it's me. So why can't I? I hate watching everybody else have a good time, it's SO unfair.<br />But anyways. Meaningless bitching. Tyler doesn't drink either - like, he DOESN'T...like refuses - he says he's got a really addictive personality and it's way too tempting. Like drugs. We stayed and laughed at drunk people - in other words everybody else except Will, and David and Amy when they appeared for 5 minutes. Then we went home...and made out.<br />Making out is really weird, if you actually think about the process. I've said this before, but it's still true. And despite the ludicrousness of the equation Prom = Sex (actually, I think the whole prom thing in general is fairly ridiculous), there is this bizarre impetus to, you know, go further. So we did. I mean, we do usually anyways. Tyler and I approach making out like the Adult Beginner Alfred's Basic book. We introduce new concepts so gradually and subtly you don't notice you're changing things until suddenly you're miles away from Square One. But Saturday we wound up places where Tyler didn't know what he was doing either, which was really weird. I'm so used to him running the show - he's the one with the driver's license, so to speak. I've only got my L. Most peculiar.<br />Lol, and we weren't the only ones. Will and Tyra made out at Katy's, as did Katy and Chris. In terms of them, it's about time. They've been going out for over a month and have kissed once! But alcohol remedied that. :p Lol I know that sounds terrible - they're both too shy to initiate anything normally; they almost need an artificial situation to break the barrier.<br />I'd better go to sleep: it's 11:37 and a Monday. We're staying at Katy's grandma's again housesiting. Feels like old times. Last time we were here was October. I told Tyler I liked him.<br /><br />Sometimes this journal feels like a gossip column.<br />G'night! :)<br /></div><br />Thursday, June 12th, 2003<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""I suppose I should write, considering that tonight - or rather, tomorrow - is somewhat of a milestone in my life."">I suppose I should write, considering that tonight - or rather, tomorrow - is somewhat of a milestone in my life. Tomorrow - yes, Friday the 13th - is the official last day of school for my grade twelve year. Four exams and a couple of ceremonies follow, but after tomorrow I will never again have a scheduled grade school class.<br />That's terrifying! On the one hand, I'm INCREDIBLY glad to have it finally over with - I've been officially Tired of School for months now - but at the same time, I find it terribly upsetting. The social aspect of it more than anything really. There are so many people that I hardly even notice at school - and yet I'll miss them terribly when they're no longer there...there are so many people that I know it's inevitable I'll lose contact with, and I find that so sad. I'll miss them. I can't help wondering what ten years will do to people...<br />It's people like Ken Adair who scare me the most. I'm so afraid of returning for a ten-year reunion to find that he killed himself a year from now...it's way too likely and that's way too terrifying.<br />It's also, coincidentally, mine and Tyler's four-month anniversary. Isn't that sad? A ""four-month anniversary""? Highschool relationships are so ridiculous. I mean, celebrating that you've been together a MONTH! That's no time at all. I can understand a year - even four months - but every month? Seems ridiculous, but people seriously make a big deal of it. Tyler and I don't...actually, I don't think we've ever even been in the same town on one of those occasions...lol which I suppose is symbolic, considering we also weren't in the same town the night he asked me out!<br /><br />Katy and I had so much fun this evening! It was hilarious. We decided at around 8pm to go for a walk - there was a light drizzle (about time; it's been unelievably gorgious for absoluately WEEKS), but not much to worry about...until about halfway throuh our walk. At which point it turned into an absoluate torrential downpour. You could barely SEE for the rain. Lol, it was great! We rolled up our pantlegs and took of our shoes and socks (or sandals, in my case) and waded through every puddle we could find. Got absolutely SOPPING wet. Froze our asses off too, but that's a secondary concern. Hope we don't catch pneumonia. It was SO much fun, though. I haven't done anything so silly in a long time and I'd forgotten...<br />Anyway...want to be alive for my LAST DAY OF SCHOOL tomorrow, so I'd better go to sleep. Many happy returns of the day and all that, Kitty. (Lol, shut up, I don't know!)<br /><br />PS Her grandmother has this amazingly annoying Cockatoo (or something) named Stupid. It says ""Hello birdie"" whenever you enter the room, and whistles - yes WHISTLES - the Andy Griffith theme song.<br />Which, by the way, I swear I know from Fred Penner and not Andy Griffith.

Guess what exploded:<br /><em>Writing in my journal would probably make more sense, since you're not going to get this for days anyhow, but I desperately want to talk with you, and this is the net best thing.<br />Funny - there are few things that make me as happy as a really good discussion with you - and there are few things that upset me as much as a really awful one.<br />The last time I cried, I was twelve. I've now cried three times in the past month. I fucking hate emotional turmoil.<br />I've been playing the part of the rope in games of tug-of-war since grade two, when my two best friends decided they hated each other, and it hasn't gotten any easier. I don't think you ever quite get used to the sensation of being ripped apart.<br />I know that sounds adolescent and melodramatic, but that's honestly how it feels sometimes. I refuse to assign blame - mostly because the main person I'd assign blame to is myself. Sometimes it feels like all I ever do is destroy other people's friendships - I'm always caught in the fucking middle. Maybe it's selfish of me to want everythign at once, but I love you both way too much to ever let either of you go. You're both such intricate parts of my soul...<br />I don't mind mountains so long as you can see that there's another side...sometimes it feels like this will never be right.<br />I don't have a whole lot to say on paper.

They're the ""scary ones"". They're only here for a few days, though.<br />This summer's already packed, and it hasn't even really started yet. I have to finish <strong>The Story</strong> - the David-and-Tyra-in-the-Hot-Tub one which has morphed into something huge - and help Kt renovate her basement. Tyler's moving into the other room down there in about a week, or whenever he finds a job. I'm having my birthday party that next weekend, and at some point we want to have a ""house-warming"" party in Katy's Basement as well. On the 11th(ish) of July, Katy, Lowell, Martina, and I are going camping in Jasper for a week, and then in August I've got Skyline and CAMMAC, so I'm gone for another three weeks.<br /><br />Tyler and Katy. Are you confused? They appear to be at each others' throats and yet they're going to be living in the same space. Maybe I should explain, but I don't really know what to tell you...<br />There's tension. That's obvious. It's okay right now. A week ago it wasn't, but we've had some minor explosions since then, and I think things are fairly stable.<br />I think it's mostly my fault, or at least I'm the fulcrum (crux) of the problem. They, for lack of a better word, fight over me. I actually think it will be good for them to spend some concentrated time together without me there - it will sort things out.&nbsp;<br /><br />Should probably go to sleep. Have to study and clean my car tomorrow. Katy starts her new job at 9am...wish her luck!! The new Harry Potter book - the fifth one, the ""Order of the Phoenix"" came out yesterday. Everyone's very excited. I haven't read it yet, though I intend to. I'd like to read the end of the fourth one againfirst, though...<br />G'night... :)<br /></div>"

I quite literally haven't cried since I was 12years old - and the release felt great! Well, after the fact. I remember now why I hate crying so much. Two main reasons: first, it's extremely inelegant. I mean, I suppose everybody's inelegant when they cry, but I feel that I look particularly undignified. It contorts all my features and I can't help making choky sobbing sounds...I hate letting my guard down like that, being so vulnerable. Also, it always feels likea guilt trip if there's anyone around. That's silly, of course...if I can't cry even when I most want to, it's obviously not a skill I can access on command. But it still feels that way.<br />Particularly today. The situation was thus: we were in Rupert. (lol, and if you've been following the Kaitylin Show regularly this season, perhaps that's explanation enough.) Tons of people were with us - Eric, Lance, and Cayley as wel as me, Katy, Tyler, and Martina, plus al the dancers who were already up for the Rupert competition; in other words Tyra, Jessica, Lindsay (Tyra's siter), Mike, and Hans, among other people. Essentially, everyone but Chris.<br />This, understandably, was a problem for Kt. Tensions built, most (understandably) directed towards me and Tyler. See, part of the problem is that Tyler's incredibly clingy. Like, doesn't want to be a separate entity from me so long as we're in the same room, and wants never to be in a room without me. Katy has issues with his attachment to my hip. It's understandable. It's like...I duno, like he usurps her position or something.<br />The second problem, though, is purely me, and it isn't at all fair (I mean, <em>I'm</em> not fair._ See, I blame Katy for everything. I mean, jokingly we blame everything on Tyler, but in all seriousness I almost always pass plame and evil on to Katy. I've got this complex where not only must I always be right and know everything, I must also be a wonderful, kind person while I'm at it. And so Katy <em>always</em> has to be bad cop, and it's completely unjust.<br />Katy thought I was crying because SHE was a horrible person...I was crying because <em>I</em> am.&nbsp;<br />I've got to start writing earlier...I have this dilemma where I don't wnat to sketch over events, but simultaneously I want to finish and sleep.<br />I try, I try. G'night, Kitty. :)<br /></div><br />Friday, May 23rd/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""I'm supposed to call Tyler at 2 o'clock (yes, AM; yes, it's stupid)..."">I'm supposed to call Tyler at 2 o'clock (yes, AM; yes, it's stupid), which is in fifteen minutes, so I suppose I might as well update.But it takes so long to give adequate coverage of everything...<br />I think the Honeymoon's over. It ended two days ago - Wednesday. There weren't any blow-ups or anything; we didn't even fight particularly, it wasn't like that. Things changed. There are definitely Problems that need sorting out. The ironic part is, you've already heard about these problems - I've acknowledged them on a personal level for months. It boils down to lack of emotion - that's the problem. I can't express emotion. I believe ""Love is not a reply"" is the phrase he used - that is to say, I never initiate emotional exchanges. It's true. The hardest part of it for him, I think - the most obvious part - is the phrase ""I love you"". I'm incapable of saying that unless he says it first. <em>Will not do it</em>.&nbsp; And the reason is ridiculous...<br />I'm terrified. That's the crisis point, plain and simple. I'm absolutely, ludicrously paranoid about losing affection. Whenever I haven't seen or talked to Tyler in a couple of days, I'm irrationally terrified that he's forgotten me, or stopped caring. 80% of me knows that's ridiculous. 20% of me is still afraid to admit it's real. I guess I've gone so long without romantic reciprocity that it's tough to accept...somewhere along the lines, I began assuming that no one was ever going to care about me like that. I'm seventeen and I know that's immensely illogical, but then, teenagers aren't known for their logic, generally. I could never see why anyone WOULD like me - there are so many beautiful, interesting girls out there; why would anyone like me? I don't know how to respond to people, so I'm always awkward and shy and boring when I meet people, and I'm not particularly attractive, physically - I don't fit together properly. I know these things. I accept them. Problem IS, though, when you've lived resigned to that mindset for five years, it's awful hard to change.<br /></div><br />Saturday, May 24th/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""I guess I'm oblivious. Well, I mean, apparently."">I guess I'm oblivious. Well, I mean, apparently.<br />It's 3AM and I just got off the phone with Tyler, when I called, as per instructions, at 1. Had an interesting discussion, the most informative part of which occurred after I was already trying to gt off the phone. We started talking about hitting on people, and then about the first couple weeks&nbsp; we knew each other.<br />Apparently he was flirting with me constantly - news to me! He says he was attracted to me immediately (which I, horribly, find really difficult to comprehend) and was essentially focussing all of his attention on me - attention that he thought I was aware of and reciprocating. Can you flirt subconsciously? Can you flirt with your eyes without knowing you're doing it? Thing is, I automatically assume guys <em>aren't</em> hitting on me...you've heard this bit before. I would never assumed that somebody was flirting with ME. Also ironic: that first night at Caroline's house. He says that of the people there, I was the only one he'd have been comfortable with touching him. Thing is, Tyra, Katy, and Martina had already jumped him, adn he looked so uncomfortable and I felt so sorry for him that I left him almost completely alone.<br />Wierd/stupid how happy that makes me.<br />Talking to Tyler has put me in a much better mood than I was in 3 hours ago - tonight, I was a NINTH wheel! Katy, Chris, David, Amy, Amanda, Matt, Katrina, Danny, and I were at David's watching <em>Donnie Darko</em>. I shared Chris, but it really wasn't the same.<br />Lol.

The ""Third Annual"" = although really it's only been about 6 months since the last one - nevertheless it is technically a different year, and we were worried that there'll never be another chance (apologies for the tense flip). So anyway. Katy and I hosted it - that is, we did all the work, spent all the money, and coped with all the stressing. The decorations were really cool! We did her baseent up really funky, with a curtain and black walls and red lights and a pillow nest. And the costumes were by far the best we've ever done them! Everyone was dressed up, including, of course, Eric as Frank. (The whole reason that we did the party tonight instead of tomorrow - the original date - was cause it turned out that Eric couldn't come Saturday, and Rocky without Eric just wouldn't be Rocky at all. We had practically every character! Tuna and I were Janet at various stages, Lance was Brad (he was <em>adorable</em> - Katy sewed him a plaid tie and cummerbund, and we got some tortoiseshell glasses for him from Mum's 3rd-World eyecare box - I think his was the most perfect costume), Kurt as RiffRaff (including tails and hump! but no hair...), Jessica as Columbia, Cayley as Magenta, Eric as Frank, Hans as Rocky (yes, golden underwear only!!), and Ender (very impressively) as Eddie. Plus miscellaneous people (Chris learned the joys of possessing breasts, for example.) Tyler couldn't come...<br />Argh, I can't concentrate - I do want to rant about this, but I'd rather do a decent job. Tomorrow?<br />'Night. :)<br /></div>"

"event","<p>April 24th/03</p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Hello again. I just wrote a letter to Tyler..."">Hello again. I just wrote a letter to Tyler, and I think I'm basically going to transcribe it for you here, cause most of it could easily double as a journal entry...<br />We got to Whistler this evening, after a long but generaly uneventful busride. Played at a Secondary School in Quesnel (stupid idea!) this morning and got ""sexually harassed"" (other people's words) by some of the male students on the way out. One of the guys told Cayley (who's a flautist, if you didn't know) that she could ""play his flute anytime."" Afterwards, she was talking to me about it and was like, ""What the fuck? Does he even know how you PLAY a flute?! I mean, what, does he want me to blow on the side of it?!""<br />I don't much care for Whistler...actually, in all honesty it kind of disgusts me. It tries way way too hard to be cute and perfect - and in my opinion, it overdoes it by a long shot. It's not a town! It's...Disneyland. And everything is astonishingly expensive. I mean, I was expectin ghtat, but...wow. We found a pair of pants in a store for $150 that I bought at Warehouse One a month ago for $30! That's a significant difference...<br />And Dylan has the exact same deodorant as Tyler, and it's really bothering me...he smells like him (sorry, bad pronoun reference...) Seriously, though, it's a problem. It makes me miss him every time Dylan's in the room And David and Amy cuddling doesn't help! *Sigh* I'm pathetic.&nbsp;<br />And so's Katy! She's been going through Chris-withdrawal. She tried to call him tonight, but they won't let us call outside the hotel from our rooms (even though she has a calling card), and there was a mile-long lineup for the payphone in the lobby.<br />'Tennyrate, I'm going to sleep. Choir performs tomorrow morning, then Concert Band in the afternoon and Jazz Band at night. Wish us luck!<br />Smudges. :)<br /></div><br />Friday, April 25th/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Choir sucked...well, no, that's unfair."">Choir sucked...well, no, that's unfair. ""Gate Gate"" was pretty good. But ""Rattle on the Stovepipe"" was too slow and ""All Ye Who Music Love"" was way too fast. But Jazz Band was good! ""Basie"" could have been better, but at least it's over. ""Missing You"" was good, even though I don't think much of the song itself. David's solo was awesome! And ""Feelin' Alright"" was probably the best we've ever played it. I hated the piano in the venue though. It sounded really tinny, and was hyper-touch-sensitive, which is worse than not being touch-sensitive, in my opinion. You have no control over dynamic levels whatsoever. Very annoying.<br />Gawd, I miss Tyler. I'ts so pathetic - I saw him on Monday. Monday! That's only five days ago. Feels like a month. Doesn't make sense, but the longer we're together at a time, the more I miss him when he leaves. We were together from Thursday til Monday - it was wonderful.<br />I don't mean for this to turn into an overshare journal, but - wow. There's stuff I need to say, and Katy doesn't want to hear it, for obvious reasons. For starters, I never realized until this weekend that I genuinely cared about being told I'm beautiful. That I have a ""great body"" (in a good way! Lol nevermind...) But I do, apparently...care, I mean. It was such an astonishing ego-boost. I felt good about myself for days afterwards - isn't that sad? I wish we lived in a culture with less ridiculous perceptions of beauty...cause see, I still dont' buy it. I can't believe that I'm beautiful (whatever that means). But I can believe that Tyler believes it, and for the moment at least that's more than enough.<br />I love it...going out with him. I'm parched for affection, and if there's on thing Tyler's good at, it's feeding that need (ooh, sorry, mixed metaphor...alright, STARVED for affection then.) And I love physical discoveries. I love making out. I love the freedom to touch and be touched. I love exploration. I'm glad that he knows what's going on and how to direct things, cause otherwise I'd be totally lost. The first few times we made out, it was awkward, but now that I've ot some idea of what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing, it's so much fun. I don't know how to judge speed in relationships, and sometimes this feels fast, but if it is I don't care.<br />We had an interesting discussion about sex on Sunday night. He said he promised his mother (even though he now realizes it was an unfair promise to make without my consent) that we wouldn't sleep together (in the non-platonic sense, that is) until we were married. In all honesty, it was the ""until"" in that sentence that bothered me more than anything else. I have serious problems with that. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying Tyler and I don't have a future together - I just don't feel in a position at this point in time to determine the outcome one way or the other. At any rate, that's beside the point. The point is, Tyler promised to practice abstinence. And he is, by the way, a vergin.<br />I guess my main issue with abstinence is hypocrisy. Practicing the letter of the law rather than the spirit, if you will. It bothers me to do everything but, as it were. It seems hypocritical somehow to still claim abstinence when you've done everything in your power to derive sexual pleasure without physically inserting Tab A into Slot B. But what do I know? Heck, I don't even believe in abstinence in the first place, so what does it matter? As I said to Tyler, we'll burn that bridge when we come to it.<br />More to write on the subject(s), but I'm falling asleep a the wheel here. :) G'night! :)<br /></div><br />Thursday, May 1st<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Fuck. I am without a doubt THE most selfish, unreasonable, and ridiculous person I know."">Fuck. I am without a doubt THE most selfish, unreasonable, and ridiculous person I know. It's driving [me] fucking NUTS! Chris got MSN, which is great because it means we finally get to berate him about whether or not he likes Kt. Yesterday, Tuna snagged him (I wasn't on) and started in that vein. So, fine. Today, I came online and he was on but so was Tuna and he won't talk to me about it cause he's already talking to her. It's FUCKING ANNOYING! Do you see how unfair this is?! I mean, do you see how unfair I'm being?! It's ridiculous. But I can't stand not being in control. I can't stand having her be asking the questions. BLAH.<br />Rant Rant Rant. Ignore me. It's probably just a side-effect of being sick and stressed out. (I have strep-throate agian, surprise surprise.)<br />Gnight.<br /></div><br />Saturday, May 3rd/03<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Ooh ooh! The BIG NEWS: Katy and Chris are going out!"">Ooh ooh! The BIG NEWS: Katy and Chris are going out! As of last night. I can't believe it happened so quickly... Following the above rant, I eventually got to actually talk to Chris, and we had quite a long, complicated conversation about walls, fears, etc. By the end of it, I was pretty sure they'd eventually go out. However, I must admit I was not expecting it to happen the next day! I had a sort of mental time-frame of minimum two weeks til showtime in my head. But this works too. And get this, it wasn't even a romantic movie like <em>What Dreams May Come</em> that we were watching - it was <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>, a fascinating and beautifully-filmed...but grim...movie about drug addicts. Chris is a sucker for creepy movies. :P<br />Anyways, it's late, I didn't get much sleep last night, I'm still recuperating, and I have tons to do tomorrow, but I had to get that out of my system. I do have a tone more to write, on that and related topics (cough Tyler cough), and I'll do my best to write tomorrow, but we all know how successful that tends to be...<br />'Night! :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""...And that, if you'll notice, was as near as no matter to two weeks ago."">...And that, if you'll notice, was as near as no matter to two weeks ago. Am I predictable, or what?!Yeah, so nun swere cool. You got the drift. Waiting around in the Terrace airport for 45 minutes for a taxi wasn't cool, but whatever. Better than the initially proposed alternative, which was to fly to Fort St John for fuel and then back to Vancouver...they thought weather would be too bad to land in Terrace or Rupert, but thankfully we made it.<br />Just in time for war. It's official. The USA is bombing Iraq. Let's not get into it - I don't feel like being depressed and I don't feel like being pissed off and if you're curious there are undoubtedly news archives covering the event. War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strenght. It's all over the news - it IS the news - and I can't help seeing it in comparison to the coverage of Septebmer 11th. That was a tragedy. This is necessary military action. One marine died yesterday. The USA is in mourning. This species is sick.&nbsp;<br /><br />But that's not what I meant to talk about, as I said. I meant to talk about Tyler.<br />Hmmm. Tyler. Too many things to say and I don't know where to begin. Okay, first off, I don't know how to kiss. I realized that this week - the first time we've kissed (practically the first time we've seen each other) since we started going out. I really just don't know how - I've never had the opportunity to learn! Katy says to just let him do everything, then, but I don't even know how to do that. Part of the problem is that our heads were on the wrong sides - I have this weird thing where I just don't understand how you can kiss with your head tilted left; I need it tilted right - but mainly I just don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my tongue, for example, among other things.<br /><br />Oh well. Strange problems. It's a peculiar predicament. The funniest thing about our relationship though, I think, is how different are our approaches to romance. Tyler is a romantic - he's very sappy. He loves pining when we're apart, and telling me he loves me, and finding sappy yet appropriate love songs. Whereas I am not. Sure, I miss him. I miss him constantly. But I don't pine about it. Am I a horrible person if I'm not yet utterly convinced that this counts as love? I don't get the love concept. I guess according to Tyler's definition I am in love with him. The world's a better place when he's in the room. I think about him too much and everything reminds me of him. I light up when he's there and all my attention is focussed on him. Is that love? Maybe (probably) I'm just too cynical. Whatever. But I am not a very good romantic - I'm far too pragmatic.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do miss him. I missed him a lot tonight - we were watching a movie, and I realized how long it's been since I last watched a movie without Tyler. I needed him there. I needed to cuddle with him. It was so frustrating.<br /><br />Spring Break's practically over and it just started. We've had a busy time. Festival rehearsals. Went to Rupert. Finished Hans's album (finally!) Festival starts on Monday, and my first solo stuff is a week from then. Scary, but it's coming together.<br /><br />Funny (jumping back a topic, sorry) how every step of the way I've pushed this relationship and now here we are and he's making all the moves and he's the one who fell. Go figure, hunh?&nbsp;<br />I could write more, but it's 20 minutes after two in the morning (Saturday) and I do need to sleep so I can accomplish things. Tomorrow's a possibililty, but I make no promises. :)<br />Sleepy smudges. 'Night, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""MARDI GRAS - Fat Tuesday.""><em>MARDI GRAS - Fat Tuesday.</em> Almost too tired to write tonight, but here we are. I'll be brief.<br />Moved from Cozumel to Valladolid today, and we'll be staying here the rest of the week til we catch the plane home from Cancun on Saturday. Valladolid's a nice town - more like reality and less like a tourist trap for the staggeringly wealthy. However, it is, in fact, Mardi Gras today (last night before Lent, for the lay among you, *L*) so it's plenty crowded and pretty noisy, even here and even at 10 o'clock at night. I can hear the music from the Plaza across the street through the door...nice enough, but very loud, and <em>extremely</em> heavy with the bass.<br />This town's really funky - it was established by Conquistadores in the 16th century, so the architecture's amazing. Fabulous church across the square (Katy would love it), and this hotel we're staying at is precious near 500 years old. Very cool.&nbsp;<br /><br />What else? Saw neat caves today - cenotes, the Mayans called them - at Aktun-Chen, on the way driving out here. Really cool...the Mayans used them as shelter from hurricanes as well as a source of fresh water and clay for pottery, and lots of them used to be submerged, so there were fossils of shellfish in amongst the stalactites.<br />Got to an Internet Cafe! And got to talk to Tyler again. He's sick and his cat's lost - I think I'm having more fun than him, lol. But it's very sad about Nezgris - I hope he turns up; he's an adorable cat! He cuddled with me...Spiff and Sasha never do that voluntarily.&nbsp;<br />And got to try a real coconut, finally, or at least the juice. Not something I'd want to drink everyday, but an interesting experience.<br />Sorry about the brevity of this entry, but I'm awful tired. 'Night! :)<br /></div>

We walked through the town - which is arranged so bizarrely; all the greenery is inside the walls, in courtyards in the middle of the blocks...it's a very foreign concept to me. The architecture was neat, though. Finally, we got to this Nunnery, which is one of the oldest buildings in Valladolid. It was realy cool! I would have spent more time there, despite the heat, but they closed it down for siesta after we'd been there maybe an hour. Neat building, though. The walls were amazingly thick, and the whole thing was so well-preserved. Looking out the window, I kept wanting everything to fade, and be back in the past (although really, that would be scary - from a merely practical view I mean - all those 16th century Spanish nuns!) Actually, what I <em>really</em> wanted to happen, which I couldn't convey properly to anybody there, since none of them had been in my Comparative Civs class, was for Peter Ustinov to come walking down the hall, talking to one of said 16th-century Nuns in English, while she answered him in Spanish, with subtitles. Lol, I think I watched entirely too many movies on the Vatican - I don't know what I'll do when I go to Rome! So anyway, we climbed up all the - very cool - stairs to the very top, where it opened onto the roof. I need some new words to replace ""cool"" and ""neat"", but it was both of those, in abundance, as well as sort of scary, when we climbed the rickety wooden ladder to the very top. If it hadn't been so bloody hot, it's exactly the sort of place I'd love to sit for hours and read my book.<br /><br />Then we wandered some more, and looked at a museum, which was set up in the oldest building in Valladolid, a chapel which adjoined the old hospital (no longer intact). All the interpretations were in Spanish, but it was kind of fun to read it anyway. I could get the gist of most of it, even if I couldn't read it word for word. Long process, though.<br />In the afternoon (after lying in the hotel room panting for a while from the heat of it all) we drove out to Rio Legartos (probably spelled wrong..) where there were, purportedly, flamingos. Beautiful drive, through real (rural) Mexico - the cutest towns and churches along the way. Even if we hadn't seen the flamingoes, I would have enjoyed it just for the drive. I really do like travelling by car, whether as a passenger or driver. But we did get to see the flamingoes, albeit more by good luck then good management. Found a road and drove down it till we got to a beach - Gulf of Mexico this time. NOt astonishingly blue and clear like the Caribbean; more green, and siltier, but nice sand and good water to paddle one's feet in. On the way back, we came to bridge, where a man with a boat was just letting off a group of people who, for 300 pesos (30 bucks American, at the moment) he had taken to see the flamingos. Took us, too. Great boat ride, vast numbers of flamingoes, which are really rather foolish-looking birds, plus some really bizarre water which was quite literally pink - supposedly as a result of the salt crystals contained therein. We took some crystals back with us, plus a lot of pictures, 2 shells, and the skeleton (so to speak) of a horseshoe crab, which Mum has christened Dobbin. She's a funny duckling, my mother.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nice ride back, good meal, etc. The shower here's kinda funny. Actually, the whole place is rather odd - I suspect it caters rather more to Europeans than Americans...did I say that? Who knows. I thought it.<br />Oh, and I am in disgrace for neglecting to mention iguanas and monkeys in my previous entries. So consider them mentioned, lol. There were iguanas absolutely all over the little ruins we saw on Cozumel, including one fabulous orange one at the entrance, plus equally vast hordes all over this area. And at the Cenote we visited yesterday, there were monkeys everywhere, which were actually very cute. I loved the sign in the parking lot: ""Please lock your car. Monkeys at play."" No, seriously! And, ""Do not bring food into the park. It will make the monkeys bite.""<br />An interesting place, Mexico. And Chichen Itza tomorrow! Goodnight! :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""And even in Mexico they have smiling teeth holding toothbrushes...""><em>And even in Mexico they have smiling teeth holding toothbrushes...<br /></em>Didn't write last night because of a nmber of things - mainly an hour spent on the (amazingly slow) Internet, combined with an irresistable urge to read my book. Aong with pressure from external sources to go to bed early.<br />I'm thinking there won't be much chance to write tonight, either. Most likely, a proper entry will have to wait until we're in Los Angeles tomorrow.<br />But a brief update, at any rate...<br /><br />Well, we've certainly gone down in the world. From the Presidente Intercontinental to a quite decent but somewhat European hotel in Valladolid to this...a $25 cabana on a beach in the Carribbean. Electricity from 6 till 11:30 nightly, hammocks, mosquite netting, a fan (which goes off with the electricity, of course), and interesting critters in the bathroom. But it's cute and authentic and has fresh-squeezed orange-juice, fresh-fried tortilla chips, and a lovely walk to a lovely beach with lovely waves and unabashed skinny-dippers. I suspect that laws governing such things are somewhat looser in Mexico, but no-one would dream of doing that at El Presidente. Hang-ups are funny things, aren't they? And that one in particular - about bodies, I mean. I suppose I'm subject to it too, from a personal point of view, but I certainly have no problem with other people being naked. It's lik, we all know what we look like anyway, for Heaven's sake, so what on Earth is the problem? It's all that retroactive Puritanism, I suppose...<br /><br />Chichen Itza yesterday and Tulum today. Both fascinating, in different ways. Chichen Itza was the more impressive site in a number of respects. The thing I most appreciated about it was that there were buildings you were allowed to go inside. Not many of them, but enough to appease me. Such was not the case in Tulum, and it frustrated me to no end. I mean, I can understand their wanting to preserve the buildings, but it's so frustrating to have to read about the carvings etc onthe insdie and not be able to see any of it. It's enough to make a person aspire to be an archeologist!<br /><br />Pressure to be finished...I'll write tomorrow.<br />G'night. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So it's tomorrow. We're in the "" this="""" at=""""><em>So it's tomorrow. We're in the ""restaurant"" at this ""hotel"". </em>It's absolutely without exception the slowest service I have ever witnessed anywhere. I can understand with the orange juice since it is quite literally fresh-squeezed, but how long does it take to make an omelet?<br />Anyway. We've now spent our last night in Mexico, which was quite pleasant until 11:30, when the fan went off. Then it was hot. Plus there was a spring in the middle of my mattress. But that's okay - it was only one night. Sorry about the messiness of this writing, btw, but it's astoundingly windy here.<br /><br />So where was I? Ruins! It's amazing how well-preserved the ones at Chichen Itza are, compared ot the other ones we've seen, especially since they're the oldest of the bunch. I guess it's because they're the furthest inland, so they don't get eroded by salt and wind and water as much. There are two parts of Chichen Itza - the older part, which dates from the 5th century (1600 years!) almost impressed me more than the new part, which was constructed mainly in the Late and Terminal Classic Periods. There were lots of carvings still very clear on all of the buildings, and even colour on a number of them - at one point, of course, all of the buildings were brilliantly painted, but now mainly all that's left is touches of red.&nbsp;<br />The Castilla, the gigantic temple which is the one everyone associated with Chichen Itza and the Maya, was certainly very impressive, and you could climb it, which made it even better. How much of a lesson in history and archaeology and architecture do you want? Each of the four sidews has 91 steps set at a 45 degree slope (very steep to climb!). The entire temple is constructed to represent the Mayan calendar cycle, and is oriented in such a way that at the Equinox the light hits it just right and forms the image of a serpent ascending or descending the building. It's actually built <em>on top</em> of another older temple pyramid, which you can go in and see, but I didn't because it was really hot and supposedly quite claustrophic in there. There's another building in the more recent part of Chichen Itza with a unique design feature related to solar events as wel...<br /><br />...I'm going to finish this on the plane or in LA, I think, since I need to pack and this might take awhile...<br /><br /><em>Still Saturday...11pm LA, 1am body time<br /></em>Might as well start writing while I wait my turn for the shower...<br />We <em>would</em> run out of sunscreen on the last day, of course. Mum claims there would have been enough to do my back and arms if I'd wanted it, but I know smfo, as it were. Today I got thoroughly sunburnt, replugged my ear, and spent the rest of the day in airports and airplanes. Then we got to LA and waited for the shuttle, and then our room wasn't made up, so we waited for them to get us a new one. And now here we are. All in all it's been an eventful day. And I truly, officially, despise my sinuses. I almost cried when my ear blocked up again - would have, if we hadn't been in a public place. It's absolutely the most frustrating experience I've ever had - and I thought it was over, and now here we are again. I hate this.<br />And I feel like a tomato. My own fault, I know. Didn't feel like getting into and out of a damp, sandy, salty bathing suit this morning when we went ""wave-jumping"", so I just swam in my bra and underwear. Both black, it worked well. And on that beach, I was by no means underdressed for the occasion. The majority of the women, in fact, were topless, and a number of people of both sexes were bottomless as well. Nevertheless, I felt most peculiar parading about the beach in my underwear - I know it's just like a bikini, but I'm so modest to begin with...it was weird, and it was almost weirder cause it wasn't that weird. Never mind. That's how I got sunburnt, anyhow. Walking down the beach for an hour in my underwear, with no sunscreen except on my shoulders and my nose.<br /><br />So, ruins .Ever more with the ruins. I'm tired of talking about Chichen Itza - if you want to know more, buy a book or visit.<br />...Actually, it's shower time and bed...amazing how after automatically reaching for the tap to brush my teeth every single day in Mexico, today I looked around for a cup and a bottle of water...in Los Angeles...<br />Tomorrow, tomorrow, the constant refrain. G'night! :)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""And just a wee bit pinker around the edges...""><em>And just a wee bit pinker around the edges...</em>despite my best intentions, my nose insists on displaying signs of redness. My ear is stuffed up, too, and driving me nuts. I hate not being able to hear!<br /><br />Hmm...and what ""witty observations"" have I to share with you tonight? Fewer than last night, I suspect, but we shall see...<br />DAMP! It is the only word for this place! Everything everywhere is damp - you just can't avoid it. All our books are warping, all our clothing - not just the bathing suits - feel s like we went swimming in it the day before and didn't let it air properly. It's been very good for my face and lips, though, I'll give it that. I've been having trouble with chapped lips in particular for months while we've gone through this dry winter. Here, I don't even need chapstick!<br /><br />Lowell's not at all well. The rest of us went on a glass-bottom boat to go snorkelling this morning, and he stayed int he hotel room and watched cartoons. He hasn't really eaten in three days. It's not good. I , on the other hand, have wound up eating entirely too much. I'm not used to this three-meals-a-day thing, and restaurant portions are huge. We've only been travelling four days, and I've had my fill (so to speak - no pun intended) of restaurants! Urgh.<br /><br />The snorkelling was cool. I didn't see anything particularly exciting (Dad saw eels and sting rays) , but there were some very beautiful fish. Our guide, Alex (who kept hitting on me) brought tortillas into the water to feed them, and they would cluster all around your face so that you could practically touch them. It was the oddest experience.<br />Other than that, we didn't do much today. Mum had classes, Lowell was sick and Dad was reading/snorkellin, so I ""practiced my piano"" on a ledge outside our room. It's actually probably really good for forcing my memory on some of the songs - the Bach, for example - cause it's impossible to run on automatic pilot.&nbsp;For the Debussy, however, playing a table is all but useless - the point is the atmosphere, not the notes. I had a towel on the ledge to protect my hands, but playing Cat and Mouse hurt my fingertips nevertheless, and I had to be in a fairly awkward position to play at all. I think I'm going to try to find a wide table or something tomorrow.<br /><br />The other thing I did this afternoon was to finish my book - I've been reading <u>Wutherin gHeights</u>, cause I'd always meant to, and in Lit Class we get credit for it. I have read few novels, however, that were as grim in scope as this one. Each character more tragic than the last, so that you couldn't help pitying - and yet, somehow, despising - each one of the sorry lot. Pracitcally everyone died at a young age, usually of consumption, after having lived a terrble, abused life. It only really worked out well for&nbsp; three characters, minus the narrator, who wasn't really involved at all. Nevertheless, it was an interesting and well-written story. I <em>am</em> glad I read it - I just need something a bit more cheery to continue.&nbsp;<br /><br />We ate dinner otnight in the oldeste restaurant on Cozumel - Casa Denis's. On the way back to the hotel (actually, this was last night, but I thought about it again on the way back tonight),Lowell pointed out the lighthouse, and said he'd never seen one before. I was appalled - he was born in Fredericton after all! And he said yes but he was little, on which point I had to concur. The point of this anecdot, however, comes from my thinking how funny it is how our associations with things can linger on long after recollections of the events themselves have passed into obscurity. I remarked to Mum that, for no particular reason, I associated that lighthouse (in Fredericton, I mean) with a ball pit. (Assuming no actual link.) And she replied that that made perfect sense, since there <em>was</em> a ballpit in that lighthouse and once when Nana and Papa visited I had been allowed in it! Funny things, brains...<br />Heavy pressure to wrap this off so Mum can turn out the light. Tomorrow: honeymoons!<br />Gnight Kitty. Buenos Noches. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Major Mardi Gras celebrations tonight""><em>Major Mardi Gras celebrations tonight </em>(parade, among other things) in San Miguel, which we studiously avoided. Call me a stick-in-the-mud, but I hate huge, noisy crowds of people. In the right mood, I wouldn't have minded it, but I've been sick all day and that would <em>not</em>&nbsp; have been fun.<br />My ear (the right one) is driving me crazy. I woke up at 4 o'clock this morning and it was completely plugged, and I couldn't unplug it. That's SUCH an awful feeling; I don't think I've ever experienced it before - like having your nose really plugged and being unable to blow it, and thus unable to breathe. Only instead, I was prevented from hearing. I could <em>feel</em> the clogged up passage running all through my head. I seriously wanted to cry in desperation. Finally went back to sleep, but it was the same when I woke up this morning. Took antihistamines etc (you can buy Penicillin over the counter here!! and various other antibiotics...) but it persisted most of the day. It's slightly better now...it unclogged a bit during supper, to my intense relief...but still nothing like normal. On top of which, of course, I had to spend the whole day half-asleep because of the medication. And I've decided I definately never want to go deaf!<br /><br />So, aside from being sick, what did I do today? We cancelled the horse-back riding thing cause Lowell was still ill (although he's getting better). Oh! We went to the Museum in the town. Very cool, but the high point was definitely (and patheitcally, I know) being able to get to a computer with Internet! And - wonder of wonders - Tyler was online! At 3pm on a Saturday afternoon! I didn't ask why...one doesn't question miracles. But it was amazing. I talked to him for about 20 minutes...which, in and of itself, was something of an adventure, since the keyboard was in Spanish! The letter keys were all in the right places, but the punctuation was all screwed up, and there were upside-down ?'s and n's with squiggles and stuff on there as normal keys. It was really bizarre - but so nice to talk to him, even if we had hardly any time. Plus he promised to email me, which is something to look forward to. :)<br /><br />We ate supper at yet another cute little Mexican restaurant. I've decided I'm definately not cut out for eating meals. I'm a grazer - I do much better with small quantities of food frequently than I do with two or three large meals. I get full so quickly...this evening when we had dinner, I hadn't eater anything all day and I was really hungry, but I still couldn't finish my meal, and it wasn't even that big as restaurant meals go. I don't know what I'd do if I had to eat at restaurants all the time.<br /><br />And honeymoons. This place makes me want to go on one. It makes me want to be married, just so I could go to a resort with my husband. They do these really cute candle-lit dinners, private ont eh beach for couples, with a guy serenading them and everything. Personally, that part of it kind of weirds me out - you're tyring to have a romantic candle-lit dinner and there's this strange guy 3 feet away singing at you!! - but the whole thing...I dunno. I guess I must be a romantic at heart. Or else I'm just a teenager. Take your pick.<br /><br />Tomorrow Mum doesn't have any courses, so we've rented a car and we're going to drive around Cozumel and see the local ruins, and botanical gardens, and what-have-you. I intend to be better. So does Lowell.<br />Buenos Noches, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It's only 10 o'clock, but they want to go to sleep. ""><em>It's only 10 o'clock, but they want to go to sleep. </em>I expect this entry will have to be brief...<br />...Hunh. Which I guess is okay, since I seem to be braindead anyway. What on Earth did we do today? Hmm... well, we took the rental car, and first we went along the coast to a park called Chankanaab. Cost more than it was worth to get in, but there was some cool stuff. Some recovered ruins from various sites in the Yucatan were there, along a little path through the jungle. I wished I'd brought my camera. It was interesting in particular to see the difference in style between the stelae and statues of the Mayans and those of the Olmec, Toltec, and Oaxacan peoples, which were also on display. There were also some submerged artifacts off the coast which you could see when you went snorkelling...artificially submerged, I suspect, but cool nonetheless.&nbsp;<br /><br />After that, we did what, for me, has easily been the coolest part of this trip so far - we visited our first official ruins! I think the site is caled San Gervasio, and it was the major Mayan city on Cozumel in the Classic and Postclassic PEriods of their civilization (AD 900-1500, mostly, with some earlier stuff - the Classic Period offically starts AD250.) Considering the age, it's absolutely amazing how much of the buildings and walkways have survived, especially considering they're constructed of limestone. I absolutely love stuff like that...ruins of old buildings that give you glimpses into an ancient time. Like historic villages (I mean, like pioneer villages) only more so. I think you have to have a vivid imagination in order to truly appreciate that stuff - you have to (at least, I have to) be able to recreate in my head what it was at the height of its glory. A story, but with visual aids. Some people suck at that, but I've done it forever.&nbsp;<br />Even if you can't do that, though, you still have to admire that stuff from the sheerly archaeological point of view. And architectural - the architectural works they accomplished without benefit of any modern technology is extraordinary - that's a helluva lot of slave labour!<br /><br />Drove around the Island (quite literally AROUND the permieter) this afternoon. Serious waves on the beaches on the Caribbean side - I've never seen such extraordinary surf! Dinner another adventure, and with the aid of a Q-tip my ear FINALLY popped properly (this morning it was clogged up again), so now all that is required is for Lowell to get better.<br />Bowing to familial pressure and turning off the lights... 'Night, Kits. :)<br /></div>

I carried him about 300 metres, and now I'm paying for it. He's only about 30 lbs lighter than me, so it's quite a feat. Makes me appreciate Tyler, lol...he insisted on piggy-backing me at the Cannery when we were in Rupert last, despite my protests. Silly boy - still, it was his own fault. And Tyler's got more to him than it looks like. He looks like maybe 160 pounds, and he weighs closer to 180. Go figure.<br />...Down From Above; I was wondering if we'd get to it...<br /><br />Had quite a nice day today, without really doing much of anything Mum and I (an dLowell, sort of) built a sandcastle this morning, with the help/hindrance of a very loquacious (sp?) two-year-old named Julia (as she told us many times) and her mother, Carolyn. Snorkelled for while, but I don't like the way it makes my ears feel, plus my contacts get dry, so mostly I lay in the sun and read my book.&nbsp;<br />I'm reading <em>The Sparrow</em>, which is an absolutely awesome book by Mary Doria russell, whom I've never heard of before. Mum told me to read it, and as usual she's right - I love it. The dialogue's wonderful, and the characterization is superb. They feel like real people. It was funny, I was down on the beach, reading, and I looked up and there was aguy sitting on the next chair over reading the same book. Then he looked up too, and we laughed and agreed that it was excellent, and went back to our respective novels.<br /><br />Lowell's still sick, poor child. That really sucks, to come to Mexico and feel lik e shit. Especially when you're in Grade 7 and it's easy to miss 2 weeks of school to be sick some other time. They've bought him some Ammoxyl (over the counter, lol) and we're hoping it's bacterial and he'll start feeling better.<br />We're leaving here tomorrow and going to the mainland. Not sure where we're staying tomorrow night - either Valladolid or some place that starts with a T that I can't remember the name of. I want to get up early tomorrow to take pictures of bird tracks in the sand before they get trampled over, plus I want to read more tonight, plus I have nothing else in particular to say, so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Mexico's nice, but sometimes it's hard not to miss home. Or at least, the people. :) Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""This place is nuts!""><em>This place is nuts!</em> It's so...so resort-y. Well, it IS a resort. It's wierd. I'm not used to this. Our room opens right onto the beach, which reminds me intensely of the Cabana in Monkey Island III. It looks exactly like that.<br />I'm no good at this Spanish thing. It's the strangest thing, but I keep wanting to speak in French. It's like, I know a foreign language is required, and the one my mouth automatically goes for is French. I have to quell the urge to say ""Je m'excuse"" when walking through a crowd, and ""Merci"" when I'm served. ""Gracias"" just doesn't roll off my tongue quite the same. 'S funny, though, I can understand the gist of Spanish pretty well, if it's spoken slowly. Dad's got pretty passable Spanish, and when he was talking to the taxi driver on the way over here, I understood most of their conversation - including the part where he asked whether our fish (in Canada) were ocean or fresh water!<br /><br />The steward who gave us our meals (almost-edible pasta) on the plane over here asked where we were from. ""Canada,"" I replied, and he said, ""Well, that explains it then. American kids never say thank-you.""&nbsp;<br /><br />Gawd, but Cancun was awful. There are few things I hate more than those pushy tour people. I mean, I know it's only their job, but we couldn't walk five steps through that airport without being accosted by someone else wanting to sell us things. And then Playa del Carmen, which is a tourist trap if I ever saw one, but cute nonetheless. Full of tiny, perfect, absurdly-priced pseudo-ethnic shops. Adorable.<br />And now Cozumel, a little island off the east coast of Mexico. Several thousand kilometres, two countries, two days, and a coast away from hom, but you can still see Orion. That reassures me, somehow. It makes me still feel connected to Northwest British Columbia in some small way. I love stars.<br /><br />Oh, and I discovered that its practically impossible - almost painful, really - for me to watch other people work. Lowell's come down sick (he's got a fever and is looking quite peaked) so I decided that instead of sharing a bed with him at the risk of contracting his illness (just as I'm getting over my own, of course), I would request a cot bed, and sleep in that. So it came, accompanied by the Ubiquitous Busboy. Who proceeded to set it up.<br />It drove me nuts! Not that he needed help - actually, I could only have hindered him, he was miraculously efficient - but it was still so difficult not to offer, to just sit there and let him do all the work. I almost had to leave the room...and would have, if the process hadn't been so fascinating to watch. I have never in my life before seen&nbsp;a bed made so incredibly efficiently. It was awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Tomorrow Mum has classes, and we are free to bask in the sun or do as we please - the beach here is absolutely gorgieous (that word again). In the afternoon I believe the paln is to go to the town on this island (where the ferry lands - I can't remember the name off-hand) and reconnoiter. I suspect they're looking for someplace less staggering to buy food.<br />...There is, of course, the mandatory MacDonalds...<br /><br />'Night, Kitty. :0 I'll write further tomorrow.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Only mildly sunburned...""><em>Only mildly sunburned...<br /></em>The beach is beautiful, though I've never been big on salt water in general. The deck chairs are beautiful. The pool is beautiful. The fish are beautiful. I think I may have to break downa nd buy a bikini in San Miguel (<em>that's</em> the name of the town on the island). Practically everyone here has them, and lots of those women have less attractive bodies than I...besides, when you're lying on your back in the sun, what does it matter?<br /><br />This afternoon we went into town. Quite nice, once we got off the main drag, but the touristy part was awful. Each of the vendors trying to outyell his opponents to get your attention. Funny, cause, in my case anyway, they accomplish basically the opposite of their goal...I steer clear even of shops I would normally go into and browse, just because I'm afraid of being accosted. A shame, there was some cute stuff...<br />The residential areas of the town were fascinating, however. The courtyards of the houses are so cool! It's like a different world... We saw bougainvillea over some of the walls, which made me think of ""The Pearl"" by John Steinbeck. (Bougainvillea was one of our vocabulary words when we did that novel in English in Grade 9.) the coolest buildings, though, I thought, were the abandoned ones. Old abandoned buildings always fascinate me. I can't but wonder at their history.&nbsp;<br />We ate dinner at an adorable Mexican-Argentinean restaurant...I don't know the name of it, but it's owned by the same family that owns the oldest restaurant on Cozumel - since 1945. The waiter (a grandson of the family) was very talkative. Another 'small world' story - he has a good friend from Prince Rupert! It was the strangest thing...<br /><br />Spanish is an interesting thing. I know it <em>isn't</em> surprising and it <em>shouldn't</em> surprise me, but I can't help being amazed at the similarities to English and French - particularly the latter. I mean, there's lots of words that are common to English, but wow - if you know French, you ca figure out practically anything written in Spanish, if you have the sense to pay attention to both context and linguistic similarities. It's so cool!<br /><br />They don't have a piano here. I'm going to go nuts - not practice for 2 weeks?! I mean, I can make do with stretches and stuff, but really, there's only so much you can do with a table. Oh well. I mean, I guess I'll survive...I sort of have to.<br />I think I dream more when I'm away from home. In LA I dreamt what was, biarrely, quite a scary dream, which more than anything was about the computer game Master of Orion, which I haven't even looked at, let alone played, in about four years. Last night was a much pleasanter dream. 'S funny, I don't dream about Tyler very much at all - I rarely have romantic/sexual dreams anyway, but when I do I hardly ever know the other person, and extremely rarely do I actually have dreams about my current crush (or, in this case, boyfriend!) This was a harmless dream...all I remember was holding Tyler...just holding him and being helf and wanting never to let go. A pleasant way to spend the night, lol.<br /><br />Tomorrow morning we're going on a glsas-bottom boat ride, and snorkelling and stuff. I hope to be able to find an Internet Cafe as well, at some point. I think there's one at the Museum my mum wants to visit.<br />It's SO humid here! Everything's damp - even this book is getting warped around the edges, and it&nbsp;hasn't been anywhere <em>near</em> water!<br /><br />G'night, Kitty. :) Sweet dreams. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Enroute over the United States maintenant...""><em>Enroute over the United States maintenant...</em>, Vancouver to Los Angeles on our way to Cozumel, Mexico via Cancun. We have a stop-over tonight in LA - I've never been there before - it should be an interesting city to land in, cause it's so big.&nbsp;<br />We're in Cozumel for a week, cause Mum's got this conference thing (continuing education, or whatever), and then we're going to travel some and look at Mayan ruins and the like. Now that we're actually on our way, I'm almost excited - I haven't been yet; I've been too busy being stressed. Have you any idea how difficult it is to miss <em>2 weeks </em>of grade 12 courses?! I'm oing to have a lot of work to catch up on! Plus, I'm not sure how I'm going to practice, and if I have to go two weeks without practicing right before Festival, it's gonna KILL my fingers! Nevertheless, we're going to Mexico, and I'm determined to have fun. :)<br /><br />Went to Rupert with Katy last weekend (Friday was a Non-Instructional Day) to see Martina and Tyler. I think she had fun, even though she's an expert at convincing herself otherwise, particularly in retrospect. I'm not sure why she does that, but it's similar to her attitudes owards practically everything. It's like she's determined not to enjoy herself.<br />At anyrate, it was mostly fun. We went to Brad's (the milkshake place) and then walked along the railroad tracks at the Cannery. It was a nice day in Rupert, for once, so we went exploring, and found the most adorable rocks along the water - perfect for sitting for hours and reading. Katy and I decided that at some point we'll have to do that.<br />In terms of Tyler, nothing changed much visibly. He was...touchy-er, but then, he's been getting progressively that way for weeks now. It's nice. :) Katy says I changed...she says I was more...well, ""aggressive"" was the word she used, but I'm not sure it's the right one. I initiated more, and reciprocated more, is what she meant. I didn't notice it, but that's probably true, and it makes sense. As she pointed out, I definately know he likes me now, so I don't need to be worried about how I'm ""supposed"" to act.<br />I think the funniest thing about the whole situation, though, is our parents, and particularly our mothers' very disparate reactions. My mother clearly doesn't care what we do (yes, that's what I mean) so long as I don't wind up in trouble (read: pregnant.) Tyler's mother, on the other hand, is adament about the abstinence thing, almost to the point of absurdity. We're not allowed to sleep in the same room when we're at his house - which, of course, is blatantly ridiculous a) because we sleep in the same bed when we're at MY house, and b) because if we anted to have sex it's silly to think that not being permitted to sleep int he same room would have any effect as a deterent, since very little sleep is actually involved. Nevertheless, one follows the rules. :) And it's not like she's not pleased about us going out.&nbsp;From the number of times she managed to slip the words ""my son's girlfriend"" into conversations while we were there, I'd say she very happy with the turn of events. It's just that Ellen Lieb would like me to <u>marry</u> (yes; that dreaded word) her son...whereas my own mother's attitude towards that hallowed institution is more along the lines of, ""Whatever you do, don't..."" An interesting predicament. But fear not...I have no plans to marry anyone at all for a number of years yet. :P<br />More later...<br /><br /><em>Nine in the evening...<br /></em>Apologies at the outset for what I fear may prove to be the rather irritating, condescending tone of this entry. I have discovered (from reading <u>Pride and Prejudice</u> last spring, if you will recall), that when I spend any great length of time reading Victorian novels, I inevitably begin adopting a similar method of speech. Well, otday I have read fully a third of <u>Wuthering Heights</u>, and no doubt my writing will be coloured accordingly. Apologies.<br />On the flight to Los Angeles, there was, accompanying us, a group of highschool students. I presume they were involved in a school travel club of some description - at any rate, they were talking of passports, and LA was not their final destination. I realized how much I truly detest teenagers. REally, it's incredibly unreasonable of me, particularly since I myself belong to that class. Obviously I like <em>some</em> teenagers (like, pretty much all the ones at my school that I know at all, plus certain Rupertites) - but teenagers, when in groups and when you don't know the individuals concerned, are rather repulsive creatures. It's certainly no fun travelling on a plane with them unless you're one of them - and even then it can be embarassing!<br />This city is huge! Yes, yes, I know, understatement of the year, but seriously! BIG! A very nice man who works at the hotel (he looks like Morgan Freeman) recommended us to a restaurant and got us a free shuttle lift there. An Italian restaurant called Italy's Little Kitchen - somewhat expensive, but good food, and absolutely adorable.<br /><br />I miss Tyler. I know that's sad, but I do. And not even because we're 10 000 miles away, either (although that too), but just on general principles. I want to have him HERE - it's most annoying. (This is the part where I skim over the rest of the entry while relaying it to Katy, cause from here on in it's useless gushing that you only need to read if you're an incurable romantic or a glutton for punishment.)<br />It's funny how much more you miss somebody when you know the feelings are reciprocated - that is, when you know that they miss you, too. It's the most perverse thing, but Tyler's been complaining and complaining about me leaving - saying he's gonna go nuts and email me every day and all that (which he DID do when I was in Vancouver, by the way)...and somehow I forgot to say I'd miss him too. I was the one who pushed this relationship, who fundamentally caused it, I suppose...and yet he's the one falling over himself with displays of affection and I find it difficult, somehow, to do likewise - not cause I don't want to, not cause I don't feel it, but, well...well, I'm not really sure why. It's bizarre. <strong><em>{[The history of our relationship and fully 1/3 of&nbsp;the problems leading to its dissolution, stated offhand and unconcernedly less than two weeks after we started going out. Wow.]}<br /></em></strong>But when it comes to affection, to romantic affection, I'm a wonderful recipient. I'm like a starved child. I take absolutely nothing for granted - I relish every moment in his presence, and my heart quite literally quickens at his every touch. Still. Maybe that's parthetic, but I've gone so long assuming that no one cared about me that way, it's like a miracle every second. <strong><em>[[Oh, absolute selfishness..you and I are clearly destined for greatness.]] </em></strong>Sometime last week I realized I could touch too, I could initiate, I could give that back, and that was another miracle. This weekend was tantalizing and yet incredibly unsatisfactory, because we had so little time alone - since we weren't permitted to sleep together - and it just gave me glimpses and left me wanting, so much more. I don't mean sex. I honestly don't care much about that either way, and if it happens and some point I have no particular moral aversions to that, but neither do I have any particular desire to cause that situation. I just mean...Being. Together. Comfort, if such a thing makes any sense in that context. I always feel unfulfilled and somewhat cheated on weekends when I see Tyler and don't get to spend the night with him - this time its worse, because it will be fully three weeks - til Spring Break - before I see him again, and I'm so far away... And there was a quality to it this weekend that made it even more painful to leave than before. As I said, nothing in particular changed, physically, but there was a quality to it, of intimacy, I suppose, that strengthened, and is so very tantalizing. Untangible, but there, and so hard to leave willfully.&nbsp;<br />At any rate. I digress. As usual. At times, in fact, this journal strikes me as simply one long digression...<br />Tomorro wmorning we fly to Cancun, and from there we have a bus ride and ferry to Cozumel and warm sandy beaches.<br /><br />Until Mexico! A lovestruck Caitlin. :)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Brief update (I am, as usual, massively tired) on the State of the Universe before I go to sleep.""><em>Brief update (I am, as usual, massively tired) on the State of the Universe before I go to sleep.<br /></em>First: Tests. Since I relied at least partially on your influence to get me through, I figure you deserve to know how they went. The Bio one (Thursday morning) was great - one of the easiest I looked at out of all those practice provincials we did. The last question was the worst, probably; it focussed on LH &amp; FSH in the Ovarian cycle - something I've never been able to keep straight. But, easy.<br />The Physics one, however, was really hard. Like, probably harder than every one of the past ones we did. However, Mr Wootton thought it was really hard too, and he wrote a letter to Victoria about it - which probably means the marks will get bumped up, since he's very influential - probably the most respected Physics teacher in the province. Seriously, UBC offers him cars and houses and exorbitant amounts of money every year to work there - but for some reason he loves Terrace, and he loves highschool phsyics. Which is wonderful for us!!<br />CCN was easy - more so than I suspected. Probably lost a maximum of 6 marks total, out of 120. Thanks. :)<br /><br />Tuna's up this weekend, so we've been ""doing stuff"". It's so bizarre to have no homework! This evening we went to the performance at the REMLee of the Vagina Monologues. It was packed! And very interesting - funny/poignant. I'd expected it to be very uncomfortable, but it wasn't. My mother's friend Karla Hennig played a lesbian dominatrix. She was hilarious, but I felt SO sorry for Alex, her 12-year-old son (Lowell's friend) who was in the audience. Watching you rmother fake an orgasm on stage in a teddy in front of 700 people - talk about mortifying!<br />Anyways, it's been. <strong><em>[[?]]</em></strong> Got a couple of Tshirts from Warehouse 1 yesterday - ""I say bad words"", and ""Don't Mess With Me, or my Angels will kick your Ass."" Cute.<br />And now it is time to sleep...G'night. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It's funny, isn't it, how things we've been anticipating for ages happen right when you least expect them.""><em>It's funny, isn't it, how things we've been anticipating for ages happen right when you least expect them. </em>When I was ten, I spent one night (shortly after I'd been given a book on ""Your Body and You"") absolutely convinced I was going to get my period that very night. I must have gone to the washroom every 20 minutes for 5 hours. I know I didn't sleep. When I finally did get my period, a couple of months later on the day before my eleventh birthday, we were in Alabama, of all places, I was entirely unprepared, and it took me completely by surprise. Go figure.<br />I guess I stopped waiting, or hoping, or expecting - you pick an appropriate verb - for him to kiss me a couple of months ago. I realized it was silly; he's expressed no interest in a romantic relationship with me, and so far I'd dragged the relationship we did have every step of the way. Why on earth should he initiate that, when he'd initiated nothing else? And naturally <em>I</em> wasn't going to kiss <em>him</em> - if you knew me at all you'd realize the idea is ludicrous - therefore it clearly wasn't going to happen. <em>C'est la vie</em>. End of story.<br />Last night after the Todd Butler concert (great satirist, phenomenal guitarist), Tyler and Katy and I watched <em>What Dreams May Come</em> in my bedroom. Well, Katy wasn't really watching it; mainly she was just sleeping on my floor. She's seen it before, and basically she just wanted an excuse not to go home. Tyler hadn't seen it before and I wanted him to&nbsp;- it's a wonderful film - so we lay in the bed and watched it.<br />I love watching movies when you've someone to intertwine yourself with - it's a novel experience, and I love it. I love cuddling - the security of having someone else there with you. Scary movies in particular are nicer if you've got a reassuring presence beside you. And I love the subtle, gentle finger-flirting that happens during movies. Just touches of fingers, moving, stroking, feather-soft. The awareness of two people of each other.<br />Last night he was very cuddly. Holding and petting and awareness. It's so funny, that awareness on two levels. Complete attention is being paid to the movie - and yet at the same time you're entirely focused on the person besdie you. <em>What Dreams May Come</em> is not a scary movie. It's beautiful. And it's romantic.<br />Romantic movies are dangerous. At least, they are for Tyler. It must have done something to him, or maybe it was just the time of night and the situation, but he's never been so totally on that secondary level before. We were utterly aware of each other, and by the time the movie finished there was this astounding, profound, unspoken tension between us. He got up to turn off the movie and came back and it was still there, that amazingly physical tension. I could feel it like an ache, everywhere in my body. I could feel it in him too, in the oddness of his breathing.<br />I apologize if this is too frank for you, but I need an outlet. Feel free to skim if its too uncomfortable. At any rate, we just lay there for nearly ten minutes, unable to do anything but let it flow through us like a circuit. Holding on, just holding on. Touching in too many places, and not nearly enough. And I don't know if he meant to or not, but he kissed me. Just leaned over, and it was dark and I didn't notice and then his mouth was on my mouth and his tongue and...well, I've never been kissed before, but I must have a fiarly accurate sub-conscious because it felt just like in dreams except it was real, and he was real.<br />We were quiet for a long time afterwards, and I don't know if my breathing sounded like his, but his was jagged, like moving across a rippled surface. I didn't know what I was supposed to say, if anything - I think I was in shock. And I didn't particularly want him to say anything - nothing I could think of would be right.<br />What he finally said was, ""I've never been that nervous about kissing a girl before. That was really odd."" I still couldn't say anything - what should I say? Then he half-laughed and said, ""Well, your mum will be pleased, anyway,"" which is ironically true. And all I could think of was my mother's not-really-joking comments about birth control a few weeks ago, and how quickly things change. We both have excellent self-control, but we still had to separate completely (40 minutes later), before we could calm down enough to sleep. And what if we weren't us, and what if we had alcohol in our systems? Don't mistake me - we were never in any danger of having sex in my waterbed with my best friend on the floor besdie us, my 12-year-old brother above us, and my parents in the next room. But that tension - it was so tangible.<br />*Lol*, that was the other thing he said that night, before we moved on: ""I'm a sucker for romantic movies...obviously."" And, ""If we had been fighting with real swords, <em>you </em>would have killed <em>me</em>.""&nbsp;<br />And now I've joined the ranks of the Been Kissed. It's so bizarre. I've been completely, pathetically useless all day. Things have only ever hit me so off kilter three times before - when I found out Travis liked me; when Travis asked me out; and whne Tyler sent me that melody/harmony email. Guys have a funny way of screwing with my internal organs. They all feel turned around and upside down. But for now...this beats 'em all.<br />And I was completely unsuspecting.<br />Go figure. 'Night, Kitty love. :)<br /><br />...And still, it sounds like a story. It sounds like someone else. Why can't I make it sound like us.<br />All I can say is, for someone who wants a solely platonic relationship, he has a funny way of expressing his convictions.<br />Caitlin.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I'm hesitant to begin writing, because inevitably when I get out my journal on an airplane, the intercom immediately comes on...""><em>I'm hesitant to begin writing, because inevitably when I get out my journal on an airplane, the intercom immediately comes on </em>to say we've begun our descent and blah blah blah. Perhaps today will be different. We shall see.<br />In case you didn't know, I'm going to Vancouver for this Honour Choir thing. I have to billet (EEK!), and I'm coming home Sunday. This is, I realized, the first time I've travelled by myself on an airplane without being a severely over-coddled Unaccompanied Minor. (Let us not even get into THAT experience!) It's kinda cool, but I'm terrified of billeting. I've only done it once (Grade 10 band trip), and it was a scary experience. I'm not good at strangers. Oh well.<br /><br />*Sigh* I think Tyler's losing his battle. We had a very odd conversation last night on MSN - he kept almost bringing things up, and then saying ""Never mind."" One of the oddest things he said was, ""You realize, of course, that the cards have changed hands..."", which threw me off. The only thing I can think he was referring to was a pervious comment of mine (in an email) that he ""held all the aces"". But what happened, then? I'm not sure why, or if there even is a why, precisely, but it sounds to me like he's falling... He was gentle and sweet and confused - he signed off with ""'Night, love."" <em>Love </em>is an extraordinarily direct word... he was shocked to learn I was leaving today - I thought he knew, but I guess not. He asked if I would email, and I said I wasn't sure I'd have the facilities available, but that <em>he</em> could always *gasp* email me. (!!) He said he would - every day. I said no offense, but I'd believe that when I saw it. If he writes me one email while I'm gone I'll be impressed.&nbsp;<br />It's funny how we switch back and forth being the romantic one. Last night, he was very sweet. He was talking the way he acts when he's being cuddly - his <em>words</em> were cuddly, they felt like he was wrapping his arms around me from behind and pulling me back against him, and nestling his chin in my hair. And somehow, the more he got like that, the more I couldn't - I felt compelled to keep my distance, to tease and feign misunderstanding. But it's gone the other way too, I've pushed it and leant against him, and although he's permitted it he was somehow unable to respond. I guess we spend a lot of time like that, taking turns being in love. And when we're both there at once, well... Saturday happens. It's massively powerful, and perhaps all the more so because for some reason it's rare.<br /><br />We talked about prom - now there's a fraught subject. He brought it up Saturday night, after... oh, and there's the announcement - we'll talk about prom later I guess. :)<br /><br />~11:39pm<br />Since I have to get up and pretend to be alive in less than seven hours, the clever thing to do would be sleep, but as we know...<br />Prom. On Saturday, Tyler said to me that he'd thought about asking me to his prom, but then realized that I would probably be miserable, and what did I think. I agreed that I probably would, and then he *asked me* if it was alright if he took someone else. To which I replied, ""Well, of course!"" It was sort of odd, like he felt he had an obligation to take me, which of course he doesn't. Kinda sweet of him to ask me though, anyway.<br />At any rate, we sorted that out, but I forgot to ask about <em>my</em> prom, which I'd been sort of meaning to bring up at a convenient time. So last night I asked him if he'd come to mine. He said, ""Yeah, for sure,"" followed by, ""although I find it funny you ask."" I said, ""What, as opposed to commanded?!"" And he replied, ""Well, yeah. I mean, you could have said 'You're taking me to prom!'"" I said that really wouldn't be very well done of me, and he said, ""Well, considering I basically asked to not take you to mine..."" I said that it still wasn't done, but anyway it didn't matter, either way his answer was yes, and we left it at that.<br /><br />""Yeah, for sure."" I didn't really realize that the idea of prom was stressing me out until suddenly it wasn't any more. I think it's been bothering me, somewhere in the back of my mind, since around Grade 10, when I realized it was practically imminent. What if I didn't get asked to prom, what if no-one would take me, what if I had to go alone? These are legitimate concerns in a life such as mine, so devoid of meaningless romantic relationships. And, go figure, that too has sorted itself out. In what is almost the nick of time, I've become, for lack of a better turn of phrase, ""romantically entangled"". I will not graduate from highschool having never been kissed, and I will have someone to take me to my prom.<br /><br />Still, the sorting-out concerns me slightly. My life has always had a way of doing that, of sorting itself out, of turning out for the best. And it's great - for me - but it's not really fair. Everything's almost always right and easy for me - why is it so hard for so many others? For some people nothing ever works out right. Why is that? Can we blame it on the stars? Was I born under a lucky one? That seems like a copout, but really, it's not fair.&nbsp;<br />And this prom thing. I want to be ecstatic about it, this weight I didn't know about has been lifted from my shoulders - but is that fair, when Katy's still in that boat? She's studiously not letting that bother her - she's good at that - but I know it does, deep down. And I feel so unfair to be relieved of that burden while she still carries it, but it's notlike I can help her with it. I can't help her like someone, and I can't share Tyler with her, and giving him up would be useless...grrr, why does highschool have to be so fraught?<br /><br />Thoroughly teenage smudges.<br />Oh, ps - My mother bought me condoms. She says she knows what I say, but she still prefers to trust her instincts.&nbsp; ...her instincts are scary.... *L, 'night. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""...but quickly... ""><em>...but quickly...&nbsp;<br /></em>She sets her clocks ahead too! And Tyler would love her - she owns ""Kind of Blue"", which is, according to Tyler, the definitive jazz album.<br />Her name's Roisin, pronounced Roy-Sheen. The other girl staying here is named Sharla, and she's from Salmon Arm. I have nothing in common with either of them. Of course. WHy is it that everyone but me seems to have things in common with most people? Why is it that I've always identified much more readily with adults than with people my own age? I mean, even the few people I do identify with are more people people (so to speak) than I am. I (obviously) get on very well with Tyler and with Katy...so how come they both seem so normal when I am clearly not.<br />At any rate. Trying not to write tangentially. Roisin and Sharla are both interesting characters, to put it mildly. Roisin strikes me as very much like everyone else. She looks popular, she likes popular stuff, she hangs out with other people who look popular. Sharla is Mormon, among other things. I get the distinct impression that she's extremely rightwing, and in particular extremely anti-gay.&nbsp;A shame, she seems like she could be an interesting girl. But very abrasive, and not at all hesitant to speak her mind.<br /><br />The choir's wonderful. It's amazing. Words cannot describe the intense feeling of joy that comes from close harmonies and perfect silences in a resonant hall full of other people who take music seriously. And the guys, especially! Hearing them sing made me want to cry...<br />More tomorrow. Late and tired. Tyler wrote!! G'night. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It never rains but it pours. He lost his battle.""><em>It never rains but it pours. He lost his battle.</em>&nbsp;<br />This afternoon I got an email from Katy which consisted of one line: ""Quick question, are you and Tyler going out?"" Confused, I talked to her when she came online, and she said she'd been talking to Tyra, would been talking to Tyler, who told her that he'd kissed me and that we were (go figure!) going out. Hunh. New to me. Don't you love grapevinces? And Tyra had told Katy and Katy was naturally appalled to receive such information from anywhere other than its source, so she asked me about it. I told her that, if that was in fact that case, nobody had bothered to inform me. Oh, she also told Martina. (!!)<br />So I asked Tyler, also on MSN, what was going on. I said that I got an email from Katy, and that she'd been talking to Tyra.<br />He said, ""Caitlin, would you go out with me?""<br />I said Yes. Of course.<br />He said *splash*.<br /><br />So. Huh. It's sort of hard to register. We're going out. What does that mean? What does that <em>change</em>? I'm still not any clearer on this point than I was last February. (Travis - remember him?) Difference is, our relationship is already at a much more profound level to begin with. In certain respects we've moved past (or through) the steps of dating. On the other hand, we've kissed once. What happened there exactly? What changed his mind? When I asked him to define our relationship 2 months ago, he told me he wasn't interested in anything more than a platonic relationship. He told me he was too self-obsessed. And I haven't pushed it since then. I've reciprocated was he's given without saking for more.<br />These steps, he's taken. I always - well, for a few months - I've known he would go out with me if I asked him. I would never have done that, not because I'm shy or don't feel it's my place, but because I couldn't put him in that position. I wouldn't push him into anything unwilling. That's abuse of power, and I know he'd be miserable. I knew I had that power, but I let it sit. He knew my thoughts on the matter, so anytime he felt ready or comfortable to take those steps, he would be more than able.&nbsp; ...To be honest, I'd sort of assumed that that meant we wouldn't go out, or at least not for months, not unless he changed drastically. Just like I didn't really believe he'd actually ever kiss me. I'm almost non-plussed. I'm in shock - again.<br />Tyler is my boyfriend. Officially. Try that on for size.. Somehow the transition makes perfect sense - somehow I've been saying that subvocally for months. So why is this such a shock, at the same time?<br />I've never done this before. I'm seventeen years old, and until last weekend I'd never kissed a guy. And until today I'd neever gone out with anyone.<br />Tyler asked me out.<br />That's one thing I love about human beings, their knack for stating and restating the utterly obvious.<br />Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. Tomorrow is also the choir concert. Tomorrow night, when I am full-up with choir instead of Tyler, I'll talk about that. Tonight, I'm busy being awestruck.<br />Somebody likes me. Someone wants to spend time with me exclusively. Moreover, this someone is someone that I liked first. This someone is someone fascinating. Someone I could spend a week with and not be bored for an instant.<br />My mother made this call two days ago. My mother is irritating. I should listen to my mother.<br />G'night. Wish me luck! :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Happy New Year!""><em>Happy New Year! </em><br />...<br />I fell again. Hard and fast and it feels like I'm down for the count. I was doing so well..<br />I've just had an incredibly fun 3 days. It really did feel like summer all over again. Saturday and Sunday were entirely taken up constructing xmas presents for the Harem plus Tyler. (Oh gosh...I just had this horrible thought that you might not know what the Harem is. For future (and past) reference, Hans is our Master and Tyra, Cayley, Jessica, Martina, Katy, and I are his concubines - it happened over the summer...anyways...) We made summer baskets for everyone, and they were adorable! The highlights (that is, the parts that took the most time and cost the most) were a 2-CD Summer Music compilation, and a calendar made from summer pictures. That in particular cost way more than was our intention.<br />At any rate, they were fun to make and <u>wonderful</u> to give people. I truly love giving people gifts that they will honestly adore.<br /><br />...*Sigh* I really want to write; I've got just oodles and oodles to say, but I'm sick and tired and have been staying up too late for days. I will talk more, but the upshot of New Years was that we adopted Andrew (Hans' step-brother) and I'm ""in love"", for lack of a better word, with Tyler again. Whole-heartedly. *sigh*.<br />So, later. G'night. :)<br /></div>

Mmm. I love boy smell. :) (Gawd, I'm such a girl! It's terrible!) And on a related note...aren't parents amusing creatures? Here's today's entertaining anecdote:<br /><br /><strong>Mum</strong> <em>(drawing back from hugging me and looking at me with that half-serious half-mocking analytical way): </em>Your father was wondering if maybe we needed to have another little talk with you about birth control...<br /><strong>I: </strong>*smirk*<br /><strong>M: </strong>Well, I told him that I thought you were pretty clear on the concept, and at any rate the point was probably moot...<br /><strong>I: </strong>Pretty clear on the concept, and any way, the point's moot.<br /><strong>M: </strong>Yes, well, just so you know. He said he thought the two of you seemed to be draping yourselves about each other more frequently than usual of late, and sometimes unexpected things can happen in the middle of the night, and it would really be a shame...<br /><strong>I: </strong>Clear on the concept. Point is moot.<br /><strong>M: </strong>He thought maybe we should buy you some condoms. You know, just in case...<br /><strong>I </strong><em>(resigned):</em> *sigh* If it would make you feel better to buy me condoms, you go right ahead. Clear on concept. Point is moot. Clear on concept. Point is moot. Clear on concept. Point is moot.<br /><br />I mean, like, WTF?! Gawd, we're not even GOING OUT! He's never even kissed me, or even shown any interest in doing so! But of course - OF COURSE - it makes perfect sense that despite this we will lose control of ourselves and have wild sex...on my <u>waterbed</u>...next door to my PARENTS' ROOM...hmm...does this conclusion seem potentially fallacious to anyone else?<br />But no. We're hormonal teenagers, after all. We can't help ourselves.<br />Obviously.<br />Yes, I know they don't mean anything by it and are just trying to be helpful, but Puh-LEASE! :p<br /><br />'Tennyrate. Past my bed-time, as usual.

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""[Backwards] Getting "" of="""" swing="""" the="""" into=""""><em>[Backwards] Getting ""back"" into the swing of things, haha...sorry. </em>First item of gossip: David and Amy are going out! It's a testament to the infrequency of my updating that you didn't even know they liked each other. Goodness, this must be confusing. At any rate, they do, and they are. This would be normal except that, well, it's David. And David + girls = bad, as he himself has informed us on more than one occasion. He was such a hermit - and we broke him out of his shell. I'm not sure whether to feel jubilant or guilty. Maybe a little of both - ""everything in moderation"", right?&nbsp;<br />Oh, and speaking of David, I decided I *ought* to have a crush on him. I don't&nbsp;- don't worry - but I ought to. He's perfect for me - just like Hans, and I couldn't like him either. Go figure. Instead I'm stuck with Tyler, lol. Who half-likes me. Whom I can only, for lack of a better word, describe as my not-boyfriend. It's one of those ""definition"" situations. We don't fit a mold. Actually, oddly enough, Tyler spent about half an hour one night a couple weeks ago being convinced that I had a crush on David - which (ironically) made him feel better, cause he has a crush on this girl, Charity, whom he met (once) at the New Year's Party...<u>anyway.<br /></u>Oh! and speaking of (post)adolescent relationships (which I believe we were), I've not yet told you about Chris Yeast...<br />Chris. He's cute, in a little boy, unibrowed sort of way. Actually, he's adorable. He reads - fontasy. He's a fun person. Altogether very good crush material - during Musical, Katy was looking, so I suggested him to her (jokingly). Trouble is, she's in danger of accidentally taking my advice and really liking him. She sees this as a problem...I don't, cause I see the potential in him to like her, too, and I think it would be good for her to be in a relationship - besides, then she can't get made at Tyler and me! :)<br />This is sketchy, but I'm getting tired. What else? Sons of Maxwell concert was tonight; it was awesome! They played ""So Confusing"", ""The Lighthouse"", AND ""Queen of Old Argyle"" (our absolute favourite) so we were very happy.&nbsp;<br />Provincials next week...studying like mad...<br />G'Night. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I never used to be a social creature - what happened?!""><em>I never used to be a social creature - what happened?! </em>Now I've been two days away from my compatriots and I'm going through withdrawal! Had a rejuvenating conversation with David this evening over MSN - first person I've really talked to since we left. He likes Amy Warner, by the way...the Rumour Mill never stops turning.<br />I really should have an Issues discussion with you pretty soon here, Kitty. Of course, the mere act of my saying that likely negates any possibility of its occurring. That's how things seem to happen in this book: for ""really need to"" read ""never going to"", throughout.<br /><br />At anyrate. Went to LOTR yesterday, but I was too tired to write; combination of going to bed late and getting up early. It's impossible to sleep in in this house - Lowell and I are housed in the loft, which opens down into the main area in the house, from which sound travels excellently, so whenever the adult members of the household rise, gather, and begin to converse (read: SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING!!!), we are inevitably woken up shortly afterwards.<br />Lol, at any rate. Went to LOTR yesterday. Personally, I liked it. It's been long enough since I read the books that I could get over the inconsistencies, and while it was definately on the battle-oriented side - well, so are the books. Particularly <u>The Two Towers</u>. I mean, that's what it IS. I had trouble with some of the hack and slash stuff - I don't feel any need to see close ups of brutal, personal violence - but I could nevertheless appreciate the artistry and tactics of the battle scenes, and it was so obviously good versus evil that I could handle the killing aspect. My favourite things about hte movie, I think, that is, the parts that I felt were best portrayed, were the transformation of Theoden and the multiple personality disorder of Gollum/Smeagol. I thought that that, in particular, was very cleverly and elegantly portrayed. The Ents were good too, although IMO they could have been a bit&nbsp;more...substantial. Good movie, anyhow.<br /><br />And today. What happened today? Well, today I became a grandmother...and not only that, but a raging one. Nana's in this...well, for lack of a better word, ""political activist"" group called the Raging Grannies. They're cute little old ladies who dress up in stupid costumes and traipse about singing (loudly and off-key) protest songs in various public areas. Anti-war, anti-big business, anti-Gordon Campbell...that sort of thing. General terrorist activites. :p (...Yes, I'm joking about the terrorism, but its actually frightening how much the Government believes it.) Anyways, they went down to a mall in Vernon to protest war toys, and Mum and I went with them, as sort of ""Grandmothers in Training."" We almost got arrested! It was fun...in a nerve-racking sort of way. And now I've definately done my civic duty for the year...which is good, cause the year's almost over. It's practically 2003! Isn't that odd? I think my ability to comprehend time ended with the year 2000. I've pretty much just failed to register the ensuing years. It's definately not the 1990s any more, I'll give you that much - but 2003 just refuses to make any impression whatsoever.&nbsp;<br /><br />At any rate. :P It's late (early), I'm tired, and I know I'll be woken up before I'm ready.&nbsp;<br />Gnight Kitty. :) Happy Holidays and DON'T BUY WAR TOYS!<br />Terrorist smudges.<br /></div>
<br />Tuesday, December 24th - Christmas Eve<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So, it's Christmas Eve, and I suppose I really *ought* to write. It's traditional after all.""><em>So, it's Christmas Eve, and I suppose I really *ought* to write. It's traditional after all. </em>I should imagine that journal writing is practically epidemic among female North American teenagers this evening and tomorrow. However, its bound to be a short entry; it's past midnight and I've imbibed enough alcohol to make me sleepy, if nothing else.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hunh. Do you realize (yes; probably) that tomorrow this book will come full circle. I wrote in it for the first time a year ago tomorrow. (Well, today, actually, but SHHH!) It's sort of sad I've only gone to pg216 in a year - maybe that seems like a lot to you, but to me it signifies that I probably didn't write as much as I should of. Had I been diligent (well, had I&nbsp;had time), I should have been able to average a page a day, at least. And we're at barely 2/3rds of that...not even. It all comes of not having enough hours in the day. That's the real problem with this world, you know? Lol.<br />Keep wishing Katy was here, for a number of reasons: 1) It's just plain odd not to have her present at family functions, 2) I'm somewhat jealous of her doing the stuff she's doing, even thought its boring, 3) most of the stuff we've done would have been more fun if Katy'd been there to analyze stuff with me, 4) I know she'd enjoy herself and I'd enjoy myself more were she here. David calls us ""a couple"", which bothers me because of the sexual implications of that title - however, if you take away the romantic part of it, platonically its pretty much true - we do <em>everything</em> together.&nbsp;<br />Anyways. Stepcousins from Hell weren't nearly as bad this year - they'd matured considerably, which is good, cause it's ABOUT TIME! (See, that's another thing - I want Katy to have met Shawn and Steph, so she'll understand.) But seriously - Stephen was almost <em>human</em>! I mean, we only spent about five hourse with him, and the monster aspect of his nature usually takes a while to manifest, but I was nevertheless impressed - at the very least, he's a heck of a lot better at *pretending* to be civilized then he used to be.<br />And Shawn's practically grown up - it's sort of scared me, actually. Not <em>him</em>, but...the implications. Looking around that living room full of family, and realizing (my, this is profound!) that we're all 10 years older than we were 10 years ago...and none of us are getting any younger. The photograph has changed - we're growing up...I can remember so distinctly Christmas with them when I was eight - and it was an instant ago. How did we get here so quickly? Ten years feels like ages - I don't want to be there tomorrow!<br /><br />...Well, Santa (in his various incarnations) is busy filling stockings downstairs, and I need sleep before the insanity of tomorrow. And so, on that upbeat, seasonal note, I'm going to bid you a good night and a Merry Christmas.<br />Em tasol!<br /></div>
<br />Wednesday, December 25th. Christmas Day.<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So, you probably don't care too much about the list of presents, do you?""><em>So, you probably don't care too much about the list of presents, do you? </em>Here are the things I was particularly joyful about: sock, sock, and more socks!; ALL the Uncle Bonsai CDs currently available; a stupid hat (like Cayley's) with bright stripy colours; and recipe cards! Yeah! For some reason, even though the physical and psychological act of Growing Up and Moving Out scares me, the actual living on my own/ cooking/ etc, is sort of exciting. :) Anyways - that's a year away yet, and I simply must pretend that that's a considerable period of time, or I'll go completely insane and become paralyzed.<br /><br />Tennyrate. This is the first Christmas I've ever had that I didn't wake up early almost accidentally. Lowell had to wake me up! It's so weird.<br />Christmas is such an anticlimax, you know? I mean, there's SO much hype, and build-up of anticipation, and there's not that much to it, really. This Christmas season hasn't felt like Christmas to me at all. I've been too busy to register it properly...I dunno. It's not that I'm ever disappointed by Christmas - I never want much, and I'm always perfectly pleased by what I receive - particularly this year. And I figure that's not really what it's about anyway. But I've never understood what all the big deal's about; like, what the point? I dunno.<br /><br />Anyways, what was the philosophical point this evening? There was one - thought of it on the way back from Bruce and Anita's this evening, but now it's gone. Oh well. It was a good one too.&nbsp;<br />...I'm an odd duckling, aren't I? I really don't think very many people can possibly think the same way I do...or the world would be a very strange place.<br />Going to play Bridge... G'night, and Merry Christmas!<br /></div>

That other stuff I wrote off the top of my head just now - I'm not sure if it'll all wind up together or not, but the first part's solid, and I'd definately like to expand it.<br /><br />(Oh! Memo to self: Remember to REMOVE UNCLE BONSAI from stereo before leaving tomorrow. This is IMPERATIVE! ...And why don't I simply do it now, they ask. Cause I'm a dumbass, that's why. Watch, I WILL forget it, and then I'll be reading this journal aloud to Katy and I'll get to this part and look sheepish, and she'll growl and put her ears back at me - I swear it!)<br />Leaving tomorrow, as you can probably tell (hence the remembering of the Uncle Bonsai...) I FINALLY finished Biology at about 6 this evening. That's essentially 3 weeks work in 2 days. I'll frankly be amazed if Katy's got it finished...but hey, que sera sera I guess, right? Can't win every battle...and I seem to lose most of them, lol.<br /><br />I'm mad at Tyler. I hope for his sake (and the sake of my sanity) that he's in Calgary or something. Otherwise, he's an asshole. He hasn't responded to my emails (like, at all, not even a ""Hey, I'm alive"") for about 2 weeks...I'm going through withdrawal, and it's SOO frustrating! I don't need to CUDDLE with him, fuck, I just want to talk to him. I haven't seen him on MSN in about a month. I miss long, pointless conversations so much. I hadn't really thought much about Tyler in a few days (basically been ignoring the fact that he's ignoring me), but I had weird (fitful) dreams last night that started me thinking again.<br />First though, I'd better explain Recent Occurences in this area...<br />Well, I guess we've been keeping on keeping on, as it were, for a couple months now. I said I liked him, and Tar Baby didn't say nuffin'. Well, that's not entirely true. He said he didn't know, which meant yes, but, which meant...well anyway, you know that part of the story. So basically, we were friends who liked each other and slept in the same bed once a week and had a marginally romantic (his words) relationship. So, fine. Eventually, however, untenable from my end. I desperately needed some definition, of something... So I sent him an email. (If you sort through all the crap, our email history - all 220K of it - is fascinating, lol...talk about bearing your soul!). I said, basically, fuck it, tell me something. Tell me <u>anything</u>. I said, you hold all the aces and I don't even know if you're interested in anything other than a platonic relationship with me.<br />And he responded with, I must admit, admirable haste. And explained. It was a 3K email, which is astounding for Tyler (a minimalist) and what it basically said was, Yes, he liked me, but he didn't want a relationship with me, certainly currently; to his mind, relationships of the romantic inclination are all-absorbing (""mind, body, heart, and soul"") and he was way too obsessed with himself to be able to devote all that to another person. <strong><em>[[gawd...can you see the seeds of contention growing already, in retrospect? I can...that boy and I so never fit emotionally...]]&nbsp;<br /></em></strong>So, fine. It didn't shock me. It didn't particularly wound me. That sounds shallow, but heck, I've been prepared for that from the beginning. That it got as far as it got is a constant source of amazement to me. That I could like somebody who liked me is/was/will be mind-boggling. Doesn't happen to me. And I've suspected too much self-absorption on the part of Tyler for a long time...I've been trying to get him to tell me that for 4 months!<br /><br />...But I haven't heard from him since. ...I've sent him several emails, and gotten nothing. And so I hope he's somewhere else, cause if not, I know what he's doing. He's distancing himself from me. He's said himself that he's an expert at leaving people. And I'm afraid he's trying to cut me out of his heart.<br />But I refuse to leave. I refuse to submit passively to removal. Screw romance, on a purely platonic level, I like Tyler. I want to be his friend. He's an interesting person with interesting ideas, and he sees things from a different angle than I do, which makes discussions fascinating, if sometimes frustrating (the nature of Infinity, for example.) There are few people I enjoy talking to as much as I enjoy talking to Tyler. So screw that. Screw safety. I refuse to stop being his friend.<br /><br />At any rate, though, on some level, my mind must still have been stressing about this, cause last night, as I said, I had a series of dreams, two of which were particularly vivid and which, in very different ways, starred Tyler.&nbsp;<br />The second was nothingg. It was cute, fluffy, borderline romantic. It involved dancing, only there were two of me and one of him. And then he had to go to a dinner...I don't remember enough about it to analyze - I just remember searching and searching and shoving through people and eventually, finally, finding him.&nbsp;<br />The first worried me. It's something fairly silly, and something I hadn't realized was bothering me until that dream dragged it out of storage into my conscious mind. In that dream, we went to Rupert...a vague ""we"", certainly involving KT and several others, although I can't see who...and we found Tyler...with his girlfriend. And he was everything I ever saw in him or wanted in him - for her. All for her. I don't knwo who she was. It didn't matter. She wasn't me. What mattered - what hurt&nbsp;- was that he had lied. To save my feelings, to save his image, I don't know. He wrote me that email, he strung me along for months, and it was all lies. And he saw me, and he was the most distant person I've ever met, like he'd never seen me before in his life - even though he'd slept culrred around me two weeks earlier.<br />It wasn't the girl that bothered me so much. It was that I wasn't worth telling. That he'd lied. That he'd changed, and hadn't bothered to tell me.<br /><br />I never - I have never - asked Tyler for coddling. I've never wanted to be kept in the dark about anything, even for my own good. All I ever wanted was honesty. I gave it, and I exptected it. If I'm not worth that much, than what am I worth?<br />Nothing.<br />That dream bothered me a lot. I'm mortally afraid of being lied to, and of being laughed at. Those are the only two things I really can't stand. Give me honest and sincerity, and I'll do my best to work from there. Without that, I haven't a leg to stand on.<br />Anyhow. That's a rather depressive not4 to end an entry <strong><em>[[and a year!]]</em></strong> on, but I'm falling asleep as I write, here. I'm not really upset, and I don't really think that of Tyler. It's just stuff I've beenpondering, and it needed an out.<br />Home tomorrow! G'night, Kitty. :)<br /><br /><strong><em>A lady from near Rising Sun<br />She flattened her boyfriend in fun<br />Saying, ""Don't worry, kid,<br />That's for nothing you did,<br />It's for something I dreamt you had done.""<br /></em><br />-ogden nash.</strong><br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""An interesting (and brief) example of how Katy=me to an amazingly large extent.""><em>An interesting (and brief) example of how Katy=me to an amazingly large extent.</em> Last weekend Tuna was up (it was the Grey Cup, so Ian and John were here being manly with Dad), and we girls hung out. Katy and Martina spent several hours talking while I was doing choreography for Production (Aaah!). Katy discovered (and promptly forgot before she could tell me) a whole nest of reasons for why she resents Tyler and me...as in, the unit (as such there is) rather than the individuals...and Martina came up with an hypothesis as to, essentially, why Tyler ""likes"" me (sorry about the superfluous quotations...I used them to mean ""for lack of a better word""...anyways...) dubbed the Elimination Theory. Basically, she thinks that when he first met us, he decided he was going to like one of us (cause its easier to like people you don't actually know, I guess)...and then he gradually worked through crossing us off: according to Tuna, she and Tyra were the first to go, followed by Jessica, and eventually Katy as well, leaving me. (Cayley being obviously un-available right from the get-go.) That, in essence, is her theory. It bothered me...a lot...but I let it slide so as not to hurt her feelings. But it almost made me mad. It...cheapens...the affection so much. Like I was the best of a bad lot, or something. well, I've already crossed off the rest of them and I have to like somebody, so I guess I'm stuck with her.<br />Gee, thanks. Can't he like me for me?&nbsp; <br />...Which is funny, cause that's essentially what Katy said...like, the self-same arguements, phrased almost identically...a couple of night ago when we were driving out to David's. I'd dismissed the subect when Tuna brought it up, cause I didn't want to argue with her, but when we were alone, Katy said, ""I want you to know that I definately don't agree with Tuna's theory on why Tyler likes you. There are too many flaws with it...and quite frankly, if I were you it would probably piss me off."" And she proceeded to tell me my arguments! Which I hadn't mentioned to anybody.<br /><br />Yeah, it was funny. Anyways. Really need to write, I know, but at the moment, sleep is more important.<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

There's nothing like washing someone else's vomit off your clothes to make you truly appreciate the benefits of not being a DD at drinking parties...&nbsp;<br /></em>So. I have tons to tell (more than I ever will be able to), and I know I'm going to be tired and become irritatingly concise about halfway through, so I'm going to write quickly.<br />It's over. It's all over - isn't that an odd feeling? We work and work for 2 and a half months, and then in 24 hours it's over. Already I miss it. It just seems like such a shame to run three shows and then stop, just when we're getting the hang of it. Although, lol, in this particular instance, I don't think we possibly could have done another show if they'd begged us to...technical difficulties, don't you know...<br />See, right from the beginning we've been having microphone problems. We started with ten working mics, but there were several that kept cutting out, and by Monday this week (Tech Rehearsal) we were down to 8 semi-reliable working microphones. Have you ever tried to run a full-scale musical with a total of eight personal mics? Boy, is that fun. So that's essentially where we stood come opening show Friday night. There were other problems as well of course, projection and choreography being the main ones, but the foremost concern in everyone's minds was mics.<br />Friday show went quite well - in fact, I was amazed we had as few problems as we did. The house was good too - as a matter of fact, all the sales were really impressive. The count was 541 tickets sold for Friday night, where they're overjoyed to break 500. The Saturday matinee was huge, and Saturday night was sold out, which hasn't happened in a few years. At any rate. The show ran fairly smoothly. All the changes happened, no mics died...there was a bit of feedback, and Becca's mic cut out in 2-4, but other than that it was fine. The audience response was mediocre...there were lots of bits I found funny that they didn't laugh at, and vice-versa. Mum said that the major problem she found was projection...especially in the underscored sections, it was really difficult to hear a lot of the lines...which is a shame...<br />Anyways. Saturday matinee was...odd. I think it was probably our strongest run, but the audience was incredibly flat. Matinee audiences tend to respond differently anyway, cause there's so many kids, but this audience was horrible...they wouldn't laugh at <em>anything</em>. They didn't even applaud after solos, without prompting from the booth. However, in terms of the actual performance, it went very smoothly.<br />And then there was Saturday night. Packed. Sold out, as I said. And incredibly responsive, right off the bat.<br />I suppose that things technically started going wrong in 1-1, when Melia missed a line of her song. But that wasn't really a big deal. Then, in 1-3, the first large group number, we wound up off beat and in some weird canon...but again, it was okay...we got back on track, and it wasn't a crisis.<br />In 1-5, Dillon dropped his mic. As in, dropped. Like, it skidded. Across the floor...broken cable, dead mic. That's where everything started to fall apart. By intermission, a bell had been struck completely out of time with its place, we were down 2 mics, several glasses had been broken, props were falling apart backstage, and just about everyone was in a state of nervous collapse. A new (emergency) mic plot was divised - and the show went on. We pulled it off...but let me tell you, I have never in my life before experienced such a stressful two hours. The worst part (as in, scariest) was 1-7, the first Fairtone number. This was in the middle of several major catastrophes...so we went on stage without a clue what the fuck we were doing (our former choreography being completely shot) aznd basically made it up on the spot. Talk about adrenalin rush.<br />*Yawn* Yeah, this entry's been getting slppier and more rushed. Cast party...3am...I'm so tired. Need to write more and more. REminder to self - discuss Chris Yeast. And finish Why I'm Mad at Katy!<br />Gnight.<br /><br /><em>May I have your attentnion please: Due to a refrigeration breakdown there will be no butter sculpture of ""The Last Supper"".<br /><br />""Well, if it isn't Hank Munson!""<br />""Well, if it isn't, his wife sure didn't seem to mind!""<br /><br />*LINOLEUM!*<br /><br /></em>lol...Gnight... :)<br /><br /><br /></div>

So lets move quickly.<br /><br />First off: I have a Harmony test at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Aaah! Wish me luck.<br />(See, now wasn't that nice and short?)<br /><br />And now Calculus.<br />*sigh*<br />Notice the date? Yes, it's Friday the thirteenth...and boy do we know it. Math class today was last block. We came in, and sat down, and Mr Inglis just stood at the front of the room, not speaking. We got quiet, and scared.&nbsp;<br />He started: ""I went to the Doctor at lunch today..."" and our hearts sunk.&nbsp;<br />Mr Inglis has epilepsy, and lately - since about September - his medication has become less effective. It no longer keeps his seizures under control. And today his doctor told him he couldn't teach anymore. He's going on sick leave for the rest of the year, and then he's retiring. We're officially - like, as of today last block - losing our Calculus teacher.<br />It was very emotional. Lots of people cried. <em>I</em>&nbsp;practically cried. We were one of the very first people he told, for which I'm grateful. His doctor, his wife, and Mr MacKay (the VP) knew before us - he didn't even tell Mr Daniels, the Principal. (For which I respect him - Mr Daniels is an ass, and Mr Inglis has no respect for him - it's hilarious.) He said that if his wife hadn't been in the Doctor's office with him, he'd probably still have been there on Monday. It's so sad...he's been teaching at Cal for 34 years this year. He taught the <u>parents </u>of all but five of the people in that Calculus class.<br />Not to mention (on the selfish side), what happens to us now? There are literally no other teachers in Terrace who have the qualifications and experience to teach Calculus 12. I think what will probably happen is that they'll juggle Mr Cook's classes in C-block and he'll take on us in that period. Just so long as we don't have Mr Tupper; he's awful. HE known his stuff, but he really honestly <u>can't teach.</u> If he was assigned to our class I would seriously think of dropping - even now, even 4 and a half months into the course. I really couldn't handle it.<br />...We were joking about calling up Mr Inglis for help, and how his answering machine will wind up sounding...lol ""If you need help with derivatives, press one...""<br />Well, I'm sure we'll survive. But God, this sucks!<br />Katy, Tyler, Chris Yeast...not necessarily in that order...<br />Gnight Kitty. :) Harmony test! Luck!<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Of course, the problem with this semi-narrative sort of journal, as I'm sure I've said before, is that the longer you don't write, the harder it is to start again.""><em>Of course, the problem with this semi-narrative sort of journal, as I'm sure I've said before, is that the longer you don't write, the harder it is to start again. </em>I'm writing this, to a certain extent, like a story, and so of course I don't want to leave out any crucial scenes or plot twists, or you won't know what's going on. But then, the longer I leave it, the more behind I get, and the harder it is to start in again because there's just so much history to fill you in on and I know it'll take forever, and all I really want to talk about is current events. So its a tossup: do I start right in with the Current Events and bypass the backlog altogether, or do I fill you in on all the in-between and put off the Current Events so long that by the time I reach them they're no longer relevant and I'm no longer interested? The problem is compouonded, of course, by the fact that I really am extremely long-winded (look at how much space I've taken up with nothing already tonight), and my writing style is quite narrative by nature - I eventually wind up in analysis and emotion, but not before I've spent a significant time in the story aspect.<br />Besides which, there're so many things since the summer that I <em>have</em> sort of glossed over without actually explaining - leaving poor you (whoever you are) very confused I'm sure. It's enitrely accidental and solely a matter of time constraints, I assure you, but...there you are.<br />Like ""The Cayley-Hans"" thing...old news now, and yet relevant to everything that's happening. But when it was current, I was too busy gushing about Tyler (there's another issue for discussion) to let their problems receive a word in edgewise. I have a vague suspicion that I've alluded to it briefly enough times that you've got the gist, but still...it never got properly explained, now it's too late, essentially, and I fell guilty. Of course, ""you"" are either me (in which case you know everything anyways), Katy or Martina&nbsp;(in which case I'm reading this to you and, yeah, you know everything anyways), or a nosy person leafing through a journal you have no business touching - close it at once! I have no sympathy for snoopers. I suppose the other two options are a) that you're a future relative of mine or b) this journal was published (!!), post-humously or not, and for some reason you're reading it. I'll hope, just for the sake of optimism, that you aren't a close friend or relative reading tearflly through my writings following my tragic, untimely death. (Ouch...sorry. Seriously KIDDING. I mean, it would be horrible if that actually were the case and you were...never mind. Shut up, Caitlin. It's just this damned morbid streak I've had ever since Hannah died last year. I've been thinking about mortality a lot since the Musical ended. Life suddenly seems so fragile...anyways. Moving on.) At any rate, if you ARE a future relative, I do apologize for not explaining more stuff, cause it must be confusing. AS for Scenario B (although this could apply to Scenario A as well) I think that were I ever to publish this stuff (although that in itself strikes me as a pretty stupid idea), I'd have to publish the Livejournal entries as well, along with several strings of emails, in order to properly explain things. It's really far too disjoint as is.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tennyrate. I truly am amazingly off-topic... I really did mean to cover at least one of the million Major Events that I'm behind on. Besides which I know that tomorrow night all I'll want to talk about is <em>The Two Towers</em><u> </u>(we're at Nana and PApa's and going to see it in Vernon tomorrow) so the real stuff will get put off even longer. Well, que sera sera, right? I guess so.&nbsp;<br />Smudges that are glad to have a couple of weeks off. :)<br />G'night! :)<br /></div>"

He has officially surpassed Travis, and let me tell you, Travis was a hard act to follow.<br />I think I'd best just transcribe for you the email that was sent me by Tyler this evening. So here goes, word for word from Tyler's mouth (or rather, hands):<br /><br /><em><strong>[for the sake of the privacy of the other characters in this drama, I've omitted the actual text of the email. Even though below I say I can't paraphrase it, the gist of the email is, ""I think we're meant to be together, but I'm worried that now isn't the right time, and if we try to have a relationship now we may destroy what we might have had."" Sorry for inconvenience and disrupting the (already erratic) narrative, but it doesn't seem fair to post publicly the private words&nbsp;of others without their consent.]</strong><br /><br /></em>So there. Do you understand my emotional turmoil now? Do you see why that had to be written out, why I couldn't simply paraphrase? What's to paraphrase? He couldn't state it except through metaphor, and I don't think I can either.<br />Wow. Huh. That was <u>definately</u><em> </em>not what I was expecting. If this entry is fairly inarticulate, it's because I'm honestly at pretty much a loss for words. What do you SAY to that? ""Right, see you in 5 years""? ""It is better to have loved and lost...""? In all my various analyses of his ""I don't know"", that wasn't one of the responses I had ever thought of. I was expecting much more flippant, much more juvenile, much more shallow. Getting...that...as a response sort of boggles my mind. I don't really know how to proceed from there.<br />And that <u>definately</u>counts as ""Yes, but I'm scared."" The scaredness is deeper and of a very different nature than what I had thought...I'm not sure what I thought, but it wasn't that.<br />I'm glad he finally told me all that, though. I'm not sure at all that I'm any less confused after reading it, but at least its a different, more useful sort of confusion.<br />I want to write and write and write and work it out of my system cause I know I won't sleep well, but I really have nothing to say - I've rarely, if ever, been this dumbfounded.<br />*Sigh* Everyone else's first relationships were straightforward and meaningless. Why does mine have to be so complex? And why do I like it so much?<br />A bewildered Caitlin.<br /></div>

Lance sent me this Forward on Hotmail...yet another stupid Survey/Horoscope thing. So I did it, to pass the time. And it was strangely accurate, giving me such responses as:<br /><em>A person you really care for is Katy<br />A person who knows you well is Mum<br /></em>and so on. I have my own speculations as to why the arrival at these answers was not so much mystical as logical, but whatever. We won't get into that. At any rate, it told me that Tyler was the person I loved. Alright. So then (here's the funny part) the song title I wrote in blank 9 is the song that describes my relationship with that person at the moment: the song was ""It's a Grand Night for Singing"" from State Fair. (Hey, I had it in my head!) And here are the lyrics to that song: <em>It's a grand night for singing/ The moon is bright above/ The earth is aglow and to add to the show/ I think I am falling in love.../ Maybe it's more than the Earth/ Shiny and silvery blue/ Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way/ Has something to do with you...</em>&nbsp;<br />So anyways. That was I found amusing! Talk about a perfect fit. And (oddly enough) the song that describes my outlook on life is ""Me and Bobby McGee"" by Janis Joplin. Hmm... <em>Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose/ Nothing ain't worth nothing but it's free... </em>Not exactly how I'd describe myself, but...who knows.<br />Gnight Kitty.... :)<br /><br /></div>

That would be so simple. Instead I have Tyler, and not a clue what is going on. Basically we've established that I like him, he likes me, and beyond that we're both kinda terrified. I was Tyler's #3 on the horoscope...and, oddly enough, also his number four. It's sort of against the rules, but he put me twice anyway - and says that the accuracy of it is eery.<br />...#3 is the one your love, #4 is the one you care the most about. Fuck, he <u>admits</u> it!<br />Gawd, I dunno. To tired to thing. G'night. :)<br /></div>
<br />Sunday, November 10th<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Fuck, so yeah, I meant to go to bed early...""><em>Fuck, so yeah, I meant to go to bed early...</em>and now it's 2...I kept waiting, foolishly, hoping Tyler would come on. I was doing alright until this evening, but gawd, I miss him so much it's pathetic. It's a physical need. I need him with my whole body, and I know that sounds so wrong, but it isn't lust. Sex doesn't really even enter into my thoughts. It's a tangible, real need, a deep-seated longing for physical presence. I need to see him. I need him in the same place as me. I need to touch him, and whether I need that as an affirmation of his existence or mine I don't know, although I'm hoping its not the latter, cause that sounds pathetic. But I'm almost shaking, I need him so much. Every fibre of me longs for the security, the safety, of his presence. Soid reality.<br />The condition was compounded a hundred-fold this evening, and I suppose I should explain why.<br />See, Martina's been feeling really down lately, cause we're all here and she's there, etc. So today, on the spur of the moment, Katy, Tyra, Cayley, and I drove to Rupert to surprise her...<br />...There is nothing more wonderful and deeply satisfyinhg than seeing the look on a person's face when you have genuinely made their day. I <em>love</em> making people happy. Martina was thrilled. It was wonderful. We went to Brad's (the milkshake place) and ate, and went to the waterfront, and drove around, and generally had a grand old time pretending that it was summer again. To end off, we drove past Hans' house. And then we were on Tyler's street.<br />Now, we didn't mean to visit Tyler. It had been our plan to visit Tuna and Tuna alone, to convince her that we really do love her. And that was fine. I was psyched for not seeing Tyler, and I was perfectly alright with that.<br />But there we were on Tyler's street, driving past Tyler's house, and Tyra said, ""Tuna, do you mind if we stop and say hi to Tyler"", and she said of course not. So we did, only he wasn't at home. So we took Martina home, and got ready to leave.&nbsp;<br />Only now, we wanted to see Tyler. I'd been fine with not seeing him, right up until we went up and knocked at his door. And now I needed to see him. I couldn't hold it in. We went back to his house, just to see. He still wasn't home, but his Mom was. She's hilarious. She told us he was at pit band practice, and let us in to rescue Katy's locket, which she'd left there, and search for weaters. And I have my sweater back! The original one; the best one. But we still had no Tyler. As a last resort, we did drive to the PRSS bandroom and get his attention by tapping on the glass, but it isn't really the same.<br />*Sigh* And now I'm stuck with pent-up Tylerness that won't leave, and I won't see him for another 5 days.<br />Somebody really needs to invent a teleporter.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It is my bounden duty to write: my neglect of this journal in recent days/weeks/months has been truly shameful.""><em>It is my bounden duty to write: my neglect of this journal in recent days/weeks/months has been truly shameful. </em>My current excuse is the Musical, which has rather usurped my life, and will continue to do so for the next two weeks (I can hardly wait for 12am, December 9th!) The process is fun, but astonishingly stressful. Today was a NID, and therefore our fabled All Day Rehearsal - the first day with Pit, and the first day with mikes. Understandably, this ought by all rights to be one of the most painful days of the entire 3 months; however, on this particular occasion it was actually amazingly productive, which is good - we needed a productive rehearsal. The scariest part at the moment is choreography...all of the dance stuff is supposed to be wrapped up by the end of October, and there's still half the Small Group stuff we haven't even <em>looked</em><u> </u>at! *shudder*. Well - what happens happens, I suppose. And I know it'll turn out fine somehow&nbsp;- it always does.<br /><br />What other straight news items do I have for you? Hmm...oh; Thibault left. Last weekend...no; two weekends ago. It's so wonderful...but oddly disconcerting...to have my house back. I got used to having him here, and it occasionally still strikes me as odd to not have him here when I get home from school. Nevertheless, it's wonderful to have free reign over the computer and my bathroom again&nbsp;- other people monopolizing my bathroom was one thing I just couldn't get used to!<br /><br />Now on to the more philosophical (read: interesting) topics. The major one is something that's been bugging me for like six weeks now; I need to figure out why I'm mad at Katy. I should have dealt with this weeks ago - coming into it at this point is tough - its like the problem's grown stale...I've buried it; it's still there, lingering, fermenting, but is much more difficult to access and treat now. Ignore that metaphor - if I weren't so tired and muddled, it would have worked... At any rate, it's very odd. I'm mad at her - not always, of course; I mean, we spend all of our time together, and we get along very well. But I grow so irritated with her sometimes, and for such petty, non-existant reasons, that it's clear there must be some deeper root to the problem.<br />I know this'll sound stupid, but I suspect a large part of it is that I'm mad at her for being sick. I want her schedule and needs to match up with mine, and when they don't, it pisses me off. Fuck, she needs so much sleep, and she's missing tons of classes - and somehow people always seem to almost ostracize <u>me</u> for that...for whatever reason. Her attitude to education bothers me a lot, in that her goals and her willpower are in many ways so different from mine. It frustrates me that she misses classes, and doesn't bother to do homework, and sulks when she doesn't get stuff instead of actually trying to correct the problem...and then whines and gets depressed when her marks aren't as good as David's! Fuck. A) David's a genius, B) What does she expect with such a lackadaisical ""poor me"" attitude?! ...Wow, this is starting to sound a lot like bitching...but I do need to figure this stuff out, and get it out of my system.<br />*Sigh* I know that a lot of it is that she's sick. ...Oh my gosh, I was about to write ""...right..."" in a really skeptical way, which merely confirms what I finally realized a couple days ago. I know it's awful, but there's a part of me deep down that honestly doesn't believe that Katy's really sick. I was trying to avoid talking about this; its horrible, but then, I suppose that's the point. I know she's not right; there must be something medical wrong with her...but there's this rebellious, cynical, sarcastic voice inside me saying Bullshit. She just wants an excuse to go to bed at nine and sleep through classes and never do anything. She's just lazy, and illness is a good excuse and makes people sorry for her, so she's convinced herself she's sick.<br />Goodness, I'm a horrible person. I can't believe I just wrote that. But demons don't disappear if you ignore them. You have to first acknowledge their existence before you can fight them effectively.<br />So there are my demons. Now lets combat them, shall we?<br />An honest (and angelic :P) Caitlin. :)<br /></div>"

And it doesn't much matter whether or not you're kindred spirits...<br />But I do not like Thibault. The longer he spends with us, the more I really just don't like him much. It's not anything in particular...or rather, it's many things in particular. And I think it's partly just that fact that he's <u>living at our house</u> - I think I react to new people the same way our cats react to new cats in their territory...with hostility. I'm used to the way our house functions with just the four of us - it's been that way since I was 4.5 years old,and it's hard to get sed to change...especially when the change is in the form of a male teenager, which is a type of animal I'm not used having to handle. It's strange. - and I think that, honestly, that probably accounts for most of my dislike of him. I mean, there's lots of personality quirks of his (mainly arrogance) that piss me off, but I don't think they'd bother me nearly so much - or that I'd even notice them - if he weren't living at my house, eating my food, hogging my bathroom, using my computer, laughing at my misfortunes and juvenile fits of peak.&nbsp;<br />As it is, though...well, I won't go into it. I don't like to spend ages bitching about people in detail...I mean, I do, but then I always feel guilty afterwards. So, I'll just refrain.<br /><br />Oh, and Katy was right - David really can be an asshole, without even really realizing it. I'd never actually believed her before that that facet of his personality existed, but after last night I do...too tired to write about it now, but suffice it to say that Katy is always right. (Duh!

(Happy Thanksgiving, by the way!) It's a stupid, symptomless sort of illness - my stomach doesn't hurt, I'm not congested, and I don't have a fever, but I'm exhausted and shaky and tired all over. I guess its some sort of flu. I've missed the last couple days of school (Monday was a holiday, of course), and just finished having quite a good talk with my mother on the subject of stress/ missing school/ production/ life in general. As she pointed out, missing 3 days of school isn't really such a huge deal in the grand scheme of things. ""Yes,"" I replied, ""but it's difficult to look at the whole picture when you're only standing three inches from the painting."" Personally I thought it rather a clever quote - my brother agrees. :)<br /><br />I think I'm mostly better. I'm having Issues surrounding missed work and needed catch-ups and too much stress, etc...I spent 20 minutes trying unsuccessfully to go to sleep while my mind spun in ferocious circles...that's when I went to talk to Mum. She actually did calm me down considerably; it was really helpful, and I know she's right, about Big Pictures and all that. ""Sometimes it's hard to see the forest for the trees.""&nbsp; Blah blah.<br /><br />Who I <u>really</u>&nbsp; need to talk to is Tyler. (Oh god, here she goes again!) No; seriously! He's really good at helping me put my thoughts in order, and at calming me down and making me smile. Not just because my heart ""goes all afluttery"" (although that too) but on a purely platonic, friendship level as well. He's an extremely calming influence...I don't think the fact that I haven't talked with him since Sunday has been any help whatsoever in terms of my sanity. Talking to him - even over MSN, even pointlessly - helps hold me together. I also really miss Real Tyler...much as I love Virtual Tyler, he's not really the same as the real thing...I can't wait for it to be Friday! Even virtual contact would be incredibly helpful right now, though. I want to talk to him about stuff so badly...some of it this stuff, and some of it pertaining to what for lack of a better word I have to term our relationship - or rather, lack thereof. Stuff needs to be said, and I'm ready to say it....but that silly child is never online at the right times! *sigh* A mental telegram for tyler: Please have a working Internet. Please get my messages.

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""An update on the Tyler situation (right - like I ever talk about anything else!):""><em>An update on the Tyler situation (right - like I ever talk about anything else!): </em>I realized that the degree to which I like Tyler is dependant to a large extent on his attitude towards me. I guess that makes sense: it's a lot easier to like a guy who's affectionate towards you than one who's withdrawn. Tyler does both - but thankfully, mostly the former. This weekend (well, Thursday night - Friday was a NID - to Saturday morning, we were in Prince Rupert to watch a couple of plays being put on by Charles Hays - Martina was running lights, and we went to support her. And Tyler was...well, very affectionate and cuddly. And again, I'm back to really liking him. Whereas last weekend, although nothing was really any different, I got a very different vibe from him, and left that weekend feeling quite confused and unsure of where I stood. I can't pinpoint what was different, but it was somehow...more...this weekend.<br /><br />I try to take things in stride and not read a novel into everything, but its hard when [he] brings you tea and lies down beside you on the floor and shares the couch (lengthwise) during the movie with you, and manouevres it subtly so that once again the two of you are sleepy together (in the utterly platonic sense, of course). I dunno. Kt and I were driving Martina to rehearsal on Friday, when she asked, ""Are you and Tyler anything more than...you and Tyler?"" I laughed at her and said, ""Well, if so, nobody bothered to inform <u>me</u>!"" But...well, I mean, we definately aren't going out. But fuck, what <u>are</u> we? Are we just friends who are physically comfortable? Or what? Does he like me? He says its very complicated and that his ""I don't know"" can't even be categorized under either of my two headings: ""No, but I don't want to hurt your feelings"" or ""Yes, but I'm scared"", either of which I could understand. Fuck, I wish he'd just <em>explain</em>! Grrrr.<br /><br />Katy says that his attitude changes when I come into the room. I can't say cause I obviously can't observe the change, but her analogy was interesting. Once Cayley and Hans had come to an understanding, if you will, he still liked us of course, and he still hung out with us and cuddled with us, even with Cayley there. But whenever she was in the room, all of his attention would focus on her and revolve around her, no matter what he was doing. Kt says Tyler does the same thing - he and Katy were joking around on the bed in the motorhome and I was still in the house. But Katy said that as soon as I came into the RV, his attention shifted to me, and it was like she wasn't there anymore. I don't see that...as far as I can tell, he pays attention to people pretty much equally, and I'm the one who focuses everything on him. It's sort of awful...and probably the most awful past is that she (understandably) was listing that as one of the things that upset her, and yet my overwhelming feeling was of joy and excitement at the idea that he notices me.<br /><br />And that's the other aspect of this that requires serious discussion and analysis. The KT aspect.<br />But that is happening another time. Right now, I sleep.<br />**A confused but mainly happy Caitlin**** :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I should be struggling through more pages of incomprehensible math.""><em>I should be struggling through more pages of incomprehensible math. </em>I should be sleeping. Instead of doing either of those sensible things, I am instead freaking out about a stupid crisis situation over which I, at the moment, have no control.<br /><br />I told Tyler I like him. Am I fucking insane? Cause that's the only reason I can think of for my total lack of judgement.&nbsp; I sent him the email. The Email. It's entitled ""Jumping on the Confession Bandwagon,"" and boy, I jumped alright! Actually, I sent him 3 emails in succession, first the confession, then the freaking-out apology, and finally (15 minutes ago) the calm, resigned, reasonable one. I feel a bit better now, having sent that, but I'm still going insane waiting for a response. And I'm house-sitting with Katy at her Grandma's house, which makes it even worse cause I can't go on the Internet every 15 minutes to check if he answered yet. (they don't have high-speed Internet - I sent the emails from my own house earlier this evening.) It's not like he's going to respond tonight anyways - he's a really slow typer, and not a quick response kinda guy, but it still makes me feel better to check.<br /><br />Aah. Biting my nails - I don't do that; this must be stressing me out... I honestly do not know what he'll say. Katy talked to him on the phone following his email response mentioned in the last entry, but couldn't get anything more out of him than, ""I honestly don't know. How can I explain this to you when I don't understand it myself?"" ...which could mean so very many different things that attempting to analyze it is pointless. I really hope that he decides he does like me...or at least that he condescends to tell me his thoughts on the matter, cause that would help so awfully much. I just want to know. This situation is untenable.<br /><br />The one thing I'm really worried about is how it will affect our friendship if he decides he doesn't like me. At the moment (or, up to the email), our friendship was fun and kinda sweet and sometimes flirtatious and often confusing. I don't want to alienate him! That's why the email thing is so dangerous...it's a definate gamble: if he likes me back, the relationship changes for the better; if he doesn't, it changes for the worst. It cannot remain static, cause its a close enough sort of friendship that you couldn't add a factor like that and keep it the same. There's not enough distance in our relationship for that...he would have to withdraw, which would suck. I don't want him to stop leaning his head on my shoulder, and curling around me when I sit on the bed he's lying in. I don't want him to be uncomfortable with physical contact, but I know that if our friendship doesn't more in the direction I want it to, then something will be necessarily lost. We can maintain the intellectual part of a friendship like this, but not the physical part. And that upsets me and worries me; I don't want him to withdraw.<br /><br />I want to know! If he says yes, then we'll move on from there; if he says no...well, I hope he says yes.<br />An apprehensive and pathetic<br />Caitlin. :\ :\ &lt;-(my heart bleeds for you while spinning around in circles.)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Again, journal-writing is the non-sensible option (sleep being the sensible one).""><em>Again, journal-writing is the non-sensible option (sleep being the sensible one). </em>At this point, I'd say it's fairly safe to say that I am NOT a sensible child.<br /><br />I talked to Tyler this evening (over MSN)... I think I learn more about what he actually thinks when I use Katy as a liaison! We talked for like two hours, and spent most of that time clevery (and adeptly) avoiding the issue at hand - we're both excellent at that, so it worked well. And I'm reassured that I can still have insane conversations with him iwthout it being awkward.<br />But the only actual <em>response</em> I could get out of him was ""I just don't know"", which, when you come right down to it, really isn't very helpful. He's coming up tomorrow night on the bus, (Cayley's birthday party is tomorrow and he has a guitar lesson in town on Saturday morning), and I think we're going to have to talk. Like, in person. I don't know how well that will work, exactly, but it has to be done. I've so many questions to ask him, but it simply can't be done over MSN, Tyler sucks at email, and I hate phones. Which leaves us face-to-face. The major thing I want to know is what does ""I don't know"" mean? <em>What</em> doesn't he know? It can't be that tough, can it?; you do or you don't. Agh, and I hope he does.<br />...I just really really don't get him...<br /><br />For Cayley's birthday, we're all chipping in to buy her a ticket down to Vancouver to visit Hans at Thanksgiving. It's gonna rock! She doesn't have much (read: <u>any)</u>&nbsp; money at the moment (her mum isn't working), and she really wants to go. I can't wait to see the look on her face when we hand her a ticket. It'll be sooo awesome - I love giving people really meaningful gifts!<br /><br />Short entry, I know, but I really do need sleep.<br />Love ya! Caitlin. xx.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""[BACKWARDS] Half trying to pay attention to people...half REALLY want to write an entry...""><em>[BACKWARDS] Half trying to pay attention to people...half REALLY want to write an entry...&nbsp;<br /></em>Tyler didn't come up this evening - his mother forbade it, since she had someone who can drive him up tomorrow, and that's cheaper. Makes sense, I suppose. Thing is though, we weren't home after school today, so he couldn't get a hold of us to tell us he wasn't coming, so we went down to the bus stop...and no stupid hat made an appearance. We were very comfused...so we phoned. His mother said he wasn't home, but she explained the situation. Katy was talking, not me, but she said it sounded like an argument. So hmmm. But I was in Tyler mode, and I really wanted him to be there! I <em>need</em> to talk with him...and then having him not be there was awful, and I <em>hate </em>that! It made me so mad at myself that I got depressed over it. It's like, it is so stupid to be this pathetic over a <u>guy</u>. So pathetic! Grrr. And then everybody felt sorry for me cause I was curled in a fetal position, and their sympathy just made me feel stupider. *Sigh* What is fucking <u>wrong</u> with me?! I've never been this pathetic before...hell, I've never actually told a guy I liked him <u>when I liked him</u> before. Blah. I just want him to like me...<br />...And there! <em>There's</em> a confusing situation! Checked my email this evening, and he'd sent us all this survey...I was in a rush, so I didn't read it all, but I read the two questions whose responses were me...Who is the one person you wouldn't mind spending 24 hours straight with? --&gt;Caitlin. And, if your dad came into the room and told you you had to get married within a week, and you could pick whomever you wanted but you had to stay with them for the rest of your life, who would you&nbsp;pick? --&gt;Caitlin.<br />Like, what the fuck?! that put butterflies in my stomach hardcore..but it's like, if you honestly think that, then why the fuck are we ""dancing"", as Katy puts it? That sounds like he's on the yes side of ""I don't know"", and it makes me so confused! I wish I knew what was going on...or at least that TYLER knew what was going on! I mean, honestly, if he tells me he doesn't like me, I'll shut up. I'll drop the subject; end of story. He won't hear about it again. But...fuck, he confused me. I think he confuses him, too. *Sigh*. We REALLY need to talk! I SO want him to be here!<br />Caitlin.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Fuck. I should be cleaning but all I want to do is write.""><em>Fuck. I should be cleaning but all I want to do is write. </em>I'm so addicted to this journal! So much emotional turmoil; I don't even really have anything new to write - I just need an out!<br /><br />Tyler, Tyler, Tyler. Can I talk about anything else? At the moment, it really doesn't seem like it, does it? Gawd.<br />Didn't sleep wel last night - it was one of those nights like when you're sick or feverish and you have all these really vivid dreams and can't ever seem to get much beyond the very surface of unconsciousness. It was <u>definitely</u>&nbsp; not very restful. The majority of the dreams centred around Tyler, and him liking me. They weren't bad dreams, just weird. There was the one really weird one where he was like, ""We have to talk,"" so I went into this room with him (it was like at a school or something, except that at the same time it was here, at Katy's grandma's house, last night.), but these two other people (a male and a female) were in there. In the dream they were Lee and Veronica, two of Tyler's friends, which was weird cause I've only met Veronica once (at the water fight) and I don't think I've ever met Lee. Plus I don't think the girl in my dream looked anything like Veronica anyway - but that's who they were. I asked why they were there, and Tyler's like, ""Well, they're our confidantes. We need witnesses, you know."" It was really weird.<br /><br />He got a hold of us today and came over for a few hours. It was so nice to see him, I'd missed him so pathetically. This morning we were lying around waiting for him to phone, so I said I'd have a shower to speed him up - and it worked. When he came, I was only wearing a towel, which felt foolish cause it felt like it was strategic, except it wasn't. Grr. Stupidity.<br />We didn't get to talk, cause he was only here for a while and it was the middle of the day, which is an impossible time to talk - it has to happen as night. I really don't know why it is, but there's something about night time which makes it way easier to talk about tough/weird things. Most of the best conversations I've had with people (except Katy) have taken place in the dark, and usually after midnight. Somehow it's just way easier to say things. Gawd, I really don't know if I can manage to wait two weeks to sort this out. I'm going to try to talk to him on MSN, but I really just think we'll wind up skirting the subject again: it has to be in person.<br /><br />He's so confusing. I'm not really sure even what his reactions to me (and my wonderful confession) is/was. It's like normal...except now he Knows. He kept drumming on my back and little things, and fuck I need to talkt o him cause it sounds so awful and not me but I honestly think he likes me. And he really doesn't want to admit it. What's he scared of? Now I think that ""I don't know"" is best translated as, ""Yes, but I'm scared"", and fuck! What is it? We so need to talk.<br /></div>

I was supposed to call Tyler tonight - actually, about now - at one a.m., but I can't cause there are too many people up and about. Sigh.<br /><br />I really miss Tyler; I'm seriously going through withdrawal...it's so pathetic. I want him. I mean...I don't mean...oh, you know what I mean. I want him to be here, now, talking to me. I want him to be where Martina is - that is, next to me in the bed. That does NOT mean, for the more evil-minded among you, that I want to sleep with him, except in the purely literal, platonic sense. I just want his presence.<br />I didn't talk to him all week - his internet was down, or something - like, since Sunday...until last night. I came home from&nbsp;watching a movie with Katy, Tyra, and Lance (""Pay It Forward"" - nice idea, good acting, irritatingly&nbsp;contrived ending) and he was finally on! I was so happy...the first thing he said to me was ""I miss you :("". We talked until about 2:30(am) which is why I'm so tired now. He said, ""Seriously, though, I can't believe how much I missed you...Grr...it's not like me...I almost even checked y email at school!"" My heart went kathump kathump (lub-ploosh!) He kept calling me ""Hon."" - it's his new favourite term of endearment. My heart went kathump kathump. It was a good conversation.<br /><br />...He <u>must</u>&nbsp; like me! How could he not, if he misses me so bloody much? He's going through the same withdrawal process as I am...we really need to Talk talk, but it keeps not happening. Well, eventually. I can't wait for it to be next weekend! I need him <em>here</em> - phones and computers just aren't the same.&nbsp;<br />Gnight, Kitty. :) A confused Caitlin.<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""*long slow breath expelled loudly through pursed lips*""><em>*long slow breath expelled loudly through pursed lips* </em>Gosh. I haven't written in <u>forever</u>! I keep meaning to and meaning to, but there just never seems to be time. Damn homework! Damn hard courses! Damn MSN! Rrrgh. I avoided MSN and Hotmail very studiously tonight and went to bed early on purpose so I could write.<br /><br />Ideally, I should fill you in on everything that's happened in the last...4 weeks since I wrote, but all I actually want to talk about is Tyler, which is really amazingly sad since he's all I talk about in ""real life"" anyway.<br />I honestly don't know where this is going, and its so strange. Every other time I've had a crush, I've known exactly where it was headed: Nowhere. And I guess as a result of that I never really tried, and when it got right down to it I never really cared.&nbsp;<br />Now I care. And I have no idea what the fuck's going on.<br />See, the thing about actually <em>caring</em>and actually, for the first time ever, <em>really wanting</em> him to like me, is that it means I'm a lot more obvious about it. I know I'm obvious, and yet it doesn't seem to matter: I do it anyway. You have to understand though, that I'm not obvious in the normal sense of the word. I don't throw myself at him, I don't bad my eyelashes, I don't leap (visibly) at any chance to touch him or fawn over him: in other words (to coin a Tyler phrase) I don't ""ask for guitar lessons."" Rather, I'm the opposite, and my every action, whether consciously or not, is dictated by how I think he will react. I know he's not a touch-y kind of person, and so I give him space. If he sits close to me, or leans his head on my shoulder, or whatever, then I'm happy with that, but I never ever drape myself over him the way Tyra does, cause I know he hates that. I never push him. However, to anyone who knows me at all, I am <em>definately</em> being obvoius - I just do it in my own unique way. I talk to Tyler. I write him pointless emails. I banter. I follow him from place to place in a completely failed attempt at subtlety. When he's inthe room, I'm focussed on him, which is maybe something you wouldn't notice if you didn't know me. I'm still a part of whatever is going on, but the majority of my attention is fixed on a specific point.<br />They (Tyler and Tuna) came up this weekend, and both of them wound up sleeping here. (Martina and I tried sharing a bed again; which was an interesting process, and Tyler got the army cot.) And everyone seems to think he likes me. Tyra thinks so, and Tyra can be astute. Martina thinks so. The funny one, though, is my mother. She asked outright a couple of weeks ago if I liked him, and what was I supposed to do, lie? So I said yes; I mean, she had it figured out anyway. She's actually irritatingly observant. So after the two of them left yesterday, she came downstairs while I was tidying. We talked about whatever for a while, and then she asked, ""So when are you two going to admit you like each other?"" I said, ""--------!"" Then I shook myself and said, ""Well, I think only one of us likes the other,"" but she just looked at me and said, ""He likes you back. I've been around the block a few times; trust me on this one."" And then she dropped it. But it made me think...cause (pessimist that I suppose I am) I'm inclined to automatically disbelieve it, but then, Mum's really quite astute. So, what?<br />Katy really isn't sure one way or the other, which is of course also just how I feel. Sometimes I think he likes me - as a result of things he says, stuff he does, whatever - and sometimes I'm convinced he doesn't. It's so hard to tell; he's confusing. And he does stuff like lean his head on my shoulder or curl around me when I'm sitting on the bed, and I know he doesn't like meaningless touching, so, what? Or he'll say something...and then sometimes, its entirely the other way round, and suddenly I'm confused again. The thing I don't get (<em>a</em> thing I don't get) is why Mum thinks he likes me, cause all of the indicators which made me think he likes me, all of the indicators which made me think he doesn't, AND all our important conversations, took place outside of her presence. So what does she have to go on? This confuses me...<br /><br />The event I really want to relate to you in an effort to psycho-analyze both myself and Tyler (along with maybe Katy) took place on Saturday night at Lindsay's costume party at Jessica's. However, it is now quarter after 11 and I need sleep, so I'll do my honest best to get to bed early and continue my rant tomorrow.&nbsp;<br />Gosh, I'd forgotten what wonderful therapy this was. Talking to Katy about everything is wonderful, but it can't quite replace the deep satisfaction one gets from the process of writing.<br />Goodnight, Kitty. Satisfied smudges! :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Well, it's not tomorrow (it's today!) but at least I'm writing.""><em>Well, it's not tomorrow (it's today!) but at least I'm writing. </em>Actually, I feel kind of sick and dizzy and awful, like I've just spun around in circles for like 10 mins - fun while you're doing it, but stopping is a really bad idea cause then you feel awful - except that I haven't been doing anything of the sort. I think it's Katy's fault, cause this afternoon she was playing Mario64 and I was watching her, and the character ran in circles around a snowman, and it made me feel <em>really sick</em> - yes; a 2D character on a screen running around a 2D snowman made me sick - is that not bizarre and pathetic? And I've felt weird ever since.<br /><br />Tonight was the first concert of this year's concert series, ""John Reischman (or something) and The Jaybirds,"" and I have to mention this because Katy and I have found Tyler's dream girl. She's the bass-player in the band, and she's perfect for him! (aside from the fact that she's, like, 25.) She looks a lot like my mother did at 16, cause she's got super-long straight dark brown hair (like, past her butt) just like Mum did. ...Tyler loves long hair. <em>Plus</em> she's an amazing vocalist and an awesome bass player. So by all rights he ought to be in love with her. Shame she's not a nine to five girl - he's decided that's what he needs.<br /><br />Blah. I DO want to write about the ""pop-tab incident"" (that's what happened at Lindsay's party last Saturday) and its repercussions, but I really don't &nbsp;feel very well and should probably sleep. So I'll do my best to write tomorrow, alright Kitty?<br />Dizzy smudges. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It's 6:30 in the morning and I am the most pathetic person in the world.""><em>It's 6:30 in the morning and I am the most pathetic person in the world. </em>Last night - no, wait, we have to go further back than that to explain. A few days ago, (2 or 3), Katy wrote an email to Tyler that didn't really say much of anything...and near the end it mentioned me, and queried (in the ""by the way"" sort of fashion but none too subtly) as to whether or not Tyler liked me. Grudgingly (but with a certain - okay, large - sense of anticipation) I let her send it.<br />He didn't reply. He takes a long time replying to emails; he's an incredibly slow typist. Last night when we got home, I checked my inbox (nothing real, as expected) and, out of habit (and a sense of insane curiousity) I opened Katy's hotmail as well. Just to <u>see</u>, you know. And there was a response from Tyler. Aack! What to do?! Katy hadn't checked it yet, and if I opened the email first, it would be marked as ""read"", and after all, it is <em>her </em>email. So I decided I was fine. Hey, I was ill anyway, I didn't need more things to pay attention to - what I needed was sleep. So I went to sleep.<br />And at quarter to 6, I woke up from a dream. I don't remember anything that happened in the dream until right at the end, when (in the dream) I opened Katy's inbox, where there was a note to me from Katy saying essentially ""Read it if you want - he doesn't like you."" In the dream, I maintained composure well. I opened the email, and started to read. However, I guess that the task of formulating a rejection letter for me, from my crush, addressed to my friend, was too much for my subconscious to handle. I woke up.<br />(Wow, I'm good at dragging out stories, aren't I?) So I lay there in bed for like 15 minutes, my mind racing. Was it a premonition? Probably not. My innate pessimism acting up? Most likely. But now I <em>had</em>&nbsp; to know, plus it was a good bet that Katy had checked her email when she got hom, so <em>she </em>already knew.<br />After agonizing for 15 minutes, I gave up and tiptoed upstairs to the computer, which is luckily far away from any of the bedrooms. Looked in Katy's inbox. She's had 3 new messages last night when I checked - now she had 2. The only one she'd looked at was Tyler's. With a definite sense of trepidation, I opened it.<br />(""Blah blah blah stuff Caitlin doesn't care about...about the Caitlin thing...the only answer is I don't know...call me and we'll talk about it, ok? Tyler's no good at this email thing..."") So he doesn't know. Or doesn't want to discuss it over Hotmail. Am I insane for thinking this is good news? ...caus I'm happy. Insanely gut-wrenchingly curious, but happy. That means, the way I read it, that he doesn't not like me. Which, all by itself, is fine with me. The fact that he has to hesitate means he's thought about it, that he's confused. ""He doesn't know."" And that's a million times better than straight-out rejection, any day.<br /><br />Of course, now I can't sleep. (Its 7am now...) I want to call Katy up and say ""Did you call him? Did you ask him? What did he say? What do you think? What should I do?"" Except I'm sure that she (like a sensible child) is asleep...as I should be.<br />Phew. Writing about things is wonderful therapy; I feel so much better now. Still imptient for it to be a resonable hour, but much better. Shall I lay here a while longer trying to sleep? Probably a good idea.<br />Goodnight (morning) Kitty.<br />Confused, anticipatory smudges.<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Well, folks, 1971 is definately Back in Style.""><em>Well, folks, 1971 is definately Back in Style. </em>Mum and I went shopping at the Limeridge Mall today, and spent the entire time laughing in disbelief at the current fashions. Honestly, some of those shirts you'd need a <em>map</em> to figure out. I mean, ruffles are bad enough; some of this stuff was awe-inspiring! These trends were just getting started when we went shopping in Calgary on the band trip in May, but that stuff was mild compared to what they've got now! {<em>doodles of the shirts</em>} Like, hello! There's more holes there then material! I just don't get it. We laughed and laughed. We did find a few nice things with relatively few ridiculous bits, and a nice dress. Mum also bought me some pretty panties, socks with fat bumblebees, and comfy pyjamas. But you don't care.<br /><br />I'm enjoying htis book I'm reading, especially the modern half. It's really funny, though, cause it's like a gay romance novel, or something (I mean gay in the sense that it's a romance between two guys, not in the derogatory sense.) I don't know why I enjoy that so much; maybe it's kind of weird that I do. But guys are turned on by lesbian action right, so why not the other way round. Reading about a romance between two guys is certainly a <em>new</em> experience, anyway, whatever else it is. The only other book I've read which involved gay <u>guy</u> romance was ""Mists of Avalon"" in which Lancelet is portrayed as actually being in love with Arthur, instead of (or maybe as well as) Guinevere. <u>That's </u>a tangled web: Morgaine loves Lancelet, Lancelet loves ARthur, Arthur loves Guinevere, Guinever loves Lancelet. Actually, come to think of it, I found the idea of Lancelet being gay kind of sexy, too. I'm an odd duck, no doubt about it. ""She's Come Undone"" had lesbian scenes, but that's definately different. Not really disturbing, but definitely not a turn-on.<br /><br />I'm going to read and then sleep. Kitchenever and Bingamin's tomorrow, I think. Still no Cayley and Hans, sorry...eventually, of course, you'll probably stop caring. I will try to update you, but it's hard to get really worked up about something when you're so far removed from the situation (physically at least) and especially when you're not in a particularly bitchy mood to begin with. Also difficult to get really into crushes...sigh. Although Tyler is undoubtedly adorable, even when he's across the country.<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :) Sweet dreams!<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I hate it when people laugh at jokes I make.""><em>I hate it when people laugh at jokes I make. </em>I mean, I don't really ; I find it gratifying, I suppose. But I'm never really sure how to react - it's embarassing. Usually people don't laugh at my jokes at all, or even understand them - the references tend to be fairly obscure, or else plain foolish, or very off-beat. Makes me feel a bit sheepish, but at least I'm used to it! This laughing thing really gets to me. Do you alugh with them, at your own joke? Do you grin? Do you maintain a poker face? I've never known how to handle the situation naturally - guess it's a good thing it doesnt' happen very much. (And I don't mean <em>jokes</em>, per se, understand? Just funny remarks...<em>jokes</em> I can handle!)<br /><br />Took a walk down Memory Lane today - went to Kitchener and Bingeman's, and past Nana and Papa's old house. That's the weirdest thing - not having that house any more. The fact that it belongs to somebody else is unimaginable - for as long as I've lived (not long, I know, but still) it's been, well, ours. They owned it for 30 years! It was really the only home base I ever had - we never owned a house anywhere for more than 4 years. It's so strange now, seeing that house and not being able to go in.<br /><br />We're going to the Cottage, tomorrow, and that'll be another experience again. I haven't seen it in five years, and I imagine it's changed. That plas is so packed with memories...I think one of the absolutely worst things about living in British Columbia is not having the cottage.I love it! My friends would love it - generations of teenagers have used that cottage as a party spot...it's perfect! ...and I can't. I really wish I could bring them. I especially wish we could've brought Katy. The waterpark today was fun, but would have been more fun with friends.<br /><br />My book (it's called <em>The Wild Swans</em>, btw) is turnign out to be about AIDS, as I suspected it would. That's a hard topic to avoid when you've got a novel about gay people in the early 80's, when the disease was just beginning to be recognized. Now Elias's lover, Sean, has it too, or at least I suspect he does. It's actually getting thoroughly depressing. But I persevere.<br /><br />I'm still jet-lagged (I hate switching time zones) and even though it's only 10:35 I'm dead tired, so I'm going to go to sleep - or at least try to; I have a very noisy window (it opens onto the highway, and there's a construction site across the road). At any rate, I'll do my best!<br />Very tired smudges. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Writing very briefly here, at the Cottage at ten to two.""><em>Writing very briefly here, at the Cottage at ten to two. </em>Funny thing is, it probably really IS about 10 to 2...am, of course. We were up playing Chinese Poker, but now everyone's going abed. I shouldn't be writing - at this rate, I'll be the last one up tomorrow, which sucks cause I want to have as many waking daylight hours here as possible.<br /><br />Considering I haven't been here in 5 or 6 years, it's amazing how little has changed. The outhouse is different, and the new one is facing the path (!!), which seems a singularly stupid idea to me, and the paths are getting overgrown, but other than that, it's pretty much the same...new (green) coat of paint...Time truly does stand still at the Cottage. I so wish I could bring everyone here...they'd love it so much. But being here alone is wonderful too, in a thoroughly different way. To really adequately rediscover a magical place, one needs Solitude. I spent quite some time sitting on the big rock by the Climbing Maple on Dodsworth's Hill today, just thinking. The fort's small and rundown. The wall collages are even more amusing than before ...I get a lot more of the jokes than I used to.<br /><br />Max (Max Palomar, that is, Lowell's forever-ago friend from Kitchener with whom he still keeps in touch) is up here with us. He's an alright kid. Slightly off his rocker, but then, aren't we all? Particularly in this family. He's huge! Taller than me, and his voice has deepend. Looks closer to 15 than 12. His voice has been bugging me...I can't decide whether he reminds me more of Brad Carson or of Ben Stein, the actor who was the Science Teacher on <em>Wonder Years</em>, and who hosts the show ""Win Ben Stein's Money."" He has that same drawl in his voice as Max does.<br /><br />Love love love the houses here in Southern Ontario. Eighty to a hundred years old and brick. They're so beautiful...much niceer than most of the places near where I live.<br /><br />...Goodness, why do I always have lots to say when I'm exhausted. Days like today, I just shouldn't even start. Want to talk about perceptions of age (ie Being Twelve) and about my bizarre dream last night and about Tyler (the two are related) and duck jokes and the Fairies in my box. And Cayley and Hans.&nbsp;<br />Hopefully at some point this all will be covered. But not right now. Goodnight. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So we're at CAMMAC, and already I can just see how the week is going to unfold.""><em>So we're at CAMMAC, and already I can just see how the week is going to unfold. </em>There are like a million and one Keenan Clan members and hangers-on ('friends and relations') here...all four of us, plus Grandma, Grandpa, Jim and Arly, Tessa, Spencer, and Mitchell, Rob and Jackson, and Megan, Corinne, and Devon. At the Opening Announcements this evening, Pat jokes that this week we had 3 groups: Anglophones, Francophones, and Keenans. I'm rooming with Megan and Corinne, and God! don't you love sister dynamics? Right now they're fighting about whether or not Corinne should be allowed to dangle her hand over the side of the bed. Thoroughly petty and irritating on both sides, but what can I do? Not much. It's not my place to regulate disputes.<br />And it's going to be like this all week. Megan wants to do everything with me...or rather, she wants me to spend all my time doing stuff with her. I don't mind spending time with her, but eventually this is going to bug me - I like to spend time alone, too, reading and practising and whatever. And if they're going to keep fighting over every little thing...anyway, we'll figure it out.<br />Too many courses, too little time, as usual. Once again my Chamber Music group coincides with the Intermediate Recorder, so again I can't do that. Finally bowed to my father's will and decided to try out the Solfege course...Broadway Choir and Voice Training were in the same time block, but I guess you can't have everything. I'm also taking Equal Voices and A Cappella. The major choral work is some impossible 20th-century work called Balshazzar's Feat. A's are really too high!<br />Really tired. As usually, all auxiliary topics get pushed to the sidelines... I'll try for time tomorrow. Quiet hour?<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Cabaret was this evening.""><em>Cabaret was this evening. </em>I got roped into doing this Jazz thing with Dad and Rob called ""When I Sing"". <strong><em>[[Hans, if you're reading this: this is the same song you recommended to me by UHF. I think it's a great song but I, too, am unable to find an mp3 version of it. My uncle Rob had it on a tape.]] </em></strong>It's mostly Rob's solo, but we were doing harmony in places, and this guy Joel, who's an awesome jazz guitarist, accompanied, along with Dad, and did fills. I was really nervous about it at first, cause I could never find my notes (no music; we were learning it off a tape), but it worked out well, actually. I had fun!<br />I'm having a hard time concentrating here - Corinne is sitting on my bed singing, and Megan's looking through my sketchbook and asking me stuff...ummm...having fun, in a busy, tiring way...<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Travis Earl. Now THERE's a confusing fellow for you.""><em>Travis Earl. Now THERE's a confusing fellow for you. </em>(Why am I talking about htis? I don't know!) Every time (well, sometimes) when he passes me in the hall or whatever, he whistles under his breath or makes a subtle comment...I mean, it's the sort of thing that you'd automatically assume was a joke - that's what I do think, normally. I mean, he's like that with everyone, not just me...at least I assume so; he's very flirty, with most girls...but then, sometimes I wonder. He's the sort of guy who would do that and pretend to be joking, but really be serious...I don't even know why I'm talking about this! I'll shut up now...<br /><br />I remember now why I so love having a group of interesting (albeit flawed) people to hang out with...cause now I remember what it's like to, for all intents and purposes, not exist. Haven't really had that experience for about a year and a half, and certainly not in the past few months. But that's what it's like here, this week. Aside from my family and the adults I sing with, I don't exist. None of the adolescents - except Megan, of course - hang out with me. This is mostly my fault, I suspect...I suck at making overtures, and I strongly suspect that my shyness comes across as haughtiness, or something similar. Thing is though, I don't really mind. Ordinarily I would, but I'm SO busy with classes and everything that I don't have time for socializing...hen I'm not singing, playing, or sleeping, I've been practising piano and writing poetry - well, lyrics - and working on a tune to one piece. I've finally got somewhere with Katy's song...that is, the song I'm writing for Katy about David (even though she doesn't like him any more; now she likes Tyler)...it's called ISLANDS. I also wrote another semi-love song called ""Solitude"". <em>I believe solitude can soothe a troubled soul/Believe that love and love alone can make you whole.</em> It's sort of about Tyler, at least some bits: <em>The one involves a guy and a guitar/ A boat drifts on a lake but we're not moving very far, </em>but it doesn't have to be about Tyler, it's just that he happens to fit my perfect scenario. He's cute, he's an amazing guitarist, AND he sails. Now how perfect is that? :p</div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I don't know why I don't just look up the date;""><em>I don't know why I don't just look up the date; </em>this journal's equipped with a built-in Perpetual Calendar, after all...yep, it's the 15th. I've got simply gads of things to say, but as usual I've left it late, and I have a French exam tomorro wat 11am which I need to be rested for, so I'm going to try to keep this brief.<br /><br />Tyra had a party...no, wait, scratch that - <em>Jessica</em> had a party at Tyra's house (don't ask) on Saturday, to which I went. There were tons of people there: the regular crew (minus Cayley, who's in Vancouver), plus Hans, Jessica Coe, Eric Cook, Manda, Aaron, Melissa, Barry Wolfenden, Jessica Bushman, Jessica's two friends from Dawson Creek, Chelsey and Emily, Lance, Dylan Wolnowski, Matt Wolnowski, this friend of Hans's from Rupert who's name has momentarily escaped me <strong><em>[[it was James McNish]]</em></strong>, plus probably other people whom I've forgotten in the shuffle. I probably would have been more fun if I hadn't stayed up until 5am the night before watching old movies with Katy. AS it was we were both dead tired, and wound up spending practically the entire evening cuddling with Hans. That was fun too, but a different sort of fun, and I kept feeling guilty. Guilt is, of course, ridiculous - see, I was feeling guilty because we were spending all our time with Hans, and Eric was getting jealous. But that's stupid...I have no reason to feel guilty, and he has no right to feel jealous. He and those other guys have had basically free reign with us for two years, and maybe they've just come to expect us to be there whenever they want us. Trankly, though, I'm getting tired of playing second fiddle to a computer game, and pussyfooting around for fear that Eric's in a bitchy mood and about to bite my head off. Hans is open and briendly, and Eric is bitter. It's an irritating and uncomfortable situation.<br /><br />I'm terribly jealous of Cayley's impending relationship with Hans, and I hate being jealous. I've decided that it's not Hans specifically I'm jealous about, it's the relationship scenario in general. (I may have said this before...I've certainly thought it before). I'm jealous of the fact that everyone except me will have been in a romantic relationship. I'm jealous that I will be <em>the only</em> girl (no exceptions once Cayley's gone_ who has never been kissed. What's wrong with me? Aren't I as attractive as those girls? ...What's worse about me than them? Is my personality repellant? Surely not! I hope not... Maybe I'm just too shy, and not forward enough. Maybe my standards are too high. Gawd, I don't know.<br />Anyway. Lots more (less angsty, more interesting) to write, but I do want to be conscious for my French test tomorrow, so wish me luck and I'll try to write tomorrow night.<br />French smudges (the very best kind!), Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Goodness, it's been a week! Damn that stupid Livejournal!""><em>Goodness, it's been a week! Damn that stupid Livejournal! </em>You and I, Kitty, need very much to have a heart-to-heart discussion on the subject of potted geraniums. (Heehee - that, in case you've forgotten <strong><em>[[you never knew]]</em></strong>, is a referrance to that stupid Kitstory prequel I started - check it out!) Tennyrate, there's lots of stuff, both angsty and not, to talk about, and I'm sure I'll never get around to half of it. I was planning just mainly to bitch this evening (PMS = self-pity = I can't help it!) , but I've managed to work most of that off in an obscenity-strewn email sent to (but not directed at) Katy, so its okay. That's good too, because bitching in here again would be redundant - what I want to complain about, and the stuff I needed to say, is virtually identical to my last entry in this journal...the whole Relationship Jealousy bit. There are two major things which I feel my life lacks at the moment, and they are definitely connected: those are action (yes, in the sexual sense) and romance. What I <em>really</em> want is a relationhip, but you know what? At this point, I'd settle for making out with someone I have no intention of going further with. I'm seventeen and I have never been kissed - this is really starting to bother me! At any rate...<br /><br />So, are you up-to-date on the Cayley aspect of this situation? The old part is that she finally confronted Kurt about her feelings, and he told her he valued her friendship, but had no interest in her romantically. So, typical Cayley (at least in one sense...) it was out-with-the-old, in-with-the-new. She's now completely in love with Hans, and the irritating part is that he likes her too...but this part you know; I've already ranted about it! My mom thinks that Hans should like me, and we should go out... I think she thinks he'd make a good son-in-law(!!!!). She doesn't think he should like Cayley...I have to admit I agree, but either way it's beside the point, right?<br /><br />Oh,and an interesting sidenote to the Kurt thing: did you know (no, you didn't, cause I haven't told you cause I just found out) that apparently he liked me for a while back, like, six months ago?! Now <em>there's</em> irony for you. When I liked him, he didn't like me, and when he liked me I didn't like him, and he <em>never</em> liked the girl who was actually seriously interested in him. And now it's too late for that! I must admit, though, much as I found it irritating when Cayley moped after Kurt, I did find that preferrable to the gushing, condescending Cayley we have on our hands now. <strong><em>[[I'm so terrible...we were so terrible...ugh.]]</em></strong> But whatever. I'm her friend and I support her and blah blah blah. I just wish she wouldn't rub it in my face!<br /><br />Em tasol, Caitlin. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Okies. Wow, I've got tons to talk about...""><em>Okies. Wow, I've got tons to talk about...</em>and I probably won't get it all down tonight cause we're in a hotel and people will probably want the lights turns out soon. Anyways. I've been meaning (and needing) to write for...at least a week, I guess, but Tuna's been staying at our house and I have a difficult time writing when she's in the room (or when anyone's inthe room, especially if they insist on talking.) ANYWAYS. (With or without an s....who cares!) I have two major things to talk about, plus a TON TON TON of things (mostly related) which I'm sure I'll forget. The major subheadings are ""Cayley and Hans"" and ""Tyler."" You don't yet know Tyler and don't really care at this point, whereas you're into the Cayley/Hans/Harem melodrama and interested to see how that plays out. Unfortunately for you, I'm not in a Bitchy mood and I <em>do</em> want to talk about Tyler, so you'll probably have to wait at least until I'm on the plane to hear about Cayley and Hans. And now, Tyler!<br /><br />Could you tell? Tyler is my new (yay!) crush. He's a Rupertite, one of Hans' friends. We (me, Tyra, and Katy) went to Rupert a few weekends ago (before the Cayley thing blew up...yes, yes, be patient!) to visit Hans, which was the first time we saw him - briefly. He and Hans were finishing up a pool game - he was cute, but seemed kind of stuck up and withdrawn. Didn't really care about it either way. Then, last weekend, he came up to Terrace with Hans, austensibly for KT's party. (They, as well as Martina, wound up staying pretty much the whole week.) And he's an amazingly interesting person! He's not cuddly - unlike Hans, he could never handle a Harem (nor would he want to)...he thinks it's too weird - he's a Monogamous Relationship kinda guy. He's a phenomenal guitar player (really really good!0 and he knows so much about music, and composers, and Harmony! It's fascinating. And he <em>thinks</em> about things, you know?Uses his brain for more than an ornament. Plus he's totally adorable - onthe Too Tall side, but so good-looking - and he looks at you when he speaks. And his sense of humour's almost exactly like mine! And he loves sailing. And - this realy is a big plus - he's a cynic! Just like me - and a fairly optimistic cynic, to boot. A romantic core, but a realistic mind. I realized this week that I would hate going out with Hans for that exact reason - his blind romantic idealism would drive me crazy. Optimism is all very well, but sometimes you have to face facts! And Tyler's totally like me on this one. <strong><em>[[Ok, I'm so not touching this tyler stuff...]] </em></strong>He's so interesting to talk to...we talked together for like an hour and a half last night while we were down by the river waiting for the fireworks to start. Mostly about music, and all totally fascinating! I could talk to him for hours, and that is truly something special. Gawd, I'm gushing so terribly...I'm so far gone! I know it's probably dull to listen to, but bear with me here. I haven't had a real crush in over a year. I'm starved for it! (Goodness I'm weird!)<br />I love the way he smells. I love massaging his back. I love that he listens to me, and laughs at things I say, even when nobody else gets them. I love that he can talk intelligently about Classical Music and doesn't automatically dismiss opera as stupid and boring. I love that he can skip stones, and wants to name his boat Egg or Harbour Assassin Extreme (Hans's suggestion.) The really hilarious, pathetic thing is that Katy and Tyra both have crushes on him too! Sigh. I think he's way more suited to me than either of them - the music thing, you know? I'm so foolishly stupidly jealous that they get to spend time with him and work on his affections for TWO WHOLE WEEKS while I'm away! I'm not worried about Tyra, but Katy's got a good shot...oh right! That's the other thing I've got to talk about: KT and Mike, and how everything happens to everyone else. Grr.<br />Goodness, Tyler's such a sweetheart, too! (Gush gush. My handwriting's getting sloppy cause I'm tired, but I can't seem to stop.) We had a major crisis with Hans last night...well, this morning...at 2am at Tyra's house on MSN. Something was said and he took it wrong and...anyway, I'll get into it when I start talking about that whole situation. Tennyrate, Hans went offline, and we knew he was distraught. (it's Hans...). We were all paralyzed, but Tyler made us call him to sort stuff out. Then we called but none of us could talk (I despise phones with a passion...can think of no worse form of communication) so Tyler the dear acted as our liaison and sorted everything out. It was way more then we had any right to ask of him, and he was so awesome about it.<br />God, I'm totally lost. Help, I'm drowning in adoration!<br />Gnight, Kitty... :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""(Airplane=messy. Sorry.) Why do I find gay guys attractive?""><em>(Airplane=messy. Sorry.) Why do I find gay guys attractive? </em>It's so perverse... I started reading a book which Grandma gave me for Christmas called ""The Wild Swans"". One of the main characters is Elias, a gay 19-year-old struggling to cope with bigotry, and I realized that I find the idea both compelling and arousing, and that's so foolish. Tennyrate.<br />Watched the 3rd Austin Powers movie (<em>Goldmember)</em> at a really nice theatre in Edmonton last night. It was stupid, of course, but funny. My favourite part is right at the beginning, when Tom Cruise plays Austin! Unfortunately, Seth Green (my personal favourite Heartthrob, although not many people agree with me) isn't nearly as adorable when balking, which is how he spends most of the movie. The only scene where he was actually very good to look at was right near the beginning, before he starts turning into his father.<br /><br />I'm <u>still</u> not in a bitchy mood, which is a pity since I really should bring you up to date on the Cayley/Hans scenario, as well as tell you about Katy and Mike. ...Alright, well, let's at least drop that shoe, even though I don't really feel like ranting at the moment. On Friday night, we were all at Tyra's watching the tapes of our last few weekends. Cayley and Hans left early as usual (yeah, later, later), so it was just Tyra, Katy, me, Tuna, Tyler, and Mike McKinnis (the dancer) left there. I gave Tyler a back massage (he ASKED, which surprised me, since he found the first one I gave him so painful), and then I lay on his back. - If you've never tried that you really should; it's amazingly comfortable. As far as I'm concerned, by far the best part of giving back massages is getting to lie on the person's back afterwards (especially if you have a crush on the person ;). Anyways, I was kind of out of it. Kt and Mike were on the floor, and they were both in really weird moods - Katy was being silly and flirty, and she's NEVER like that. She's usually Miss Reservation, even worse than me. And Mike was particularly horny, even for Mike. He'd been hitting on me earlier in the evening, but now, obviously, I was occupied with Tyler, and perfectly willing to remain that way. So, Kt and Mike were together, and doing some kind of weird shit...like, she was BITING HIS EARS. That's a very Tyra thing to do, but it's very NOT Katy. It was strange. So anyway, eventually Tuna and I left (1:30am-ish) to go home and sleep. Tyler and Katy were staying the night at Tyra's, as was Mike.<br />The next morning, the five of us went downtown to watch the Riverboat Days Parade, and we met up with Mike and some other people.<br />""Wow,"" says Mike, ""This is really awkward.""<br />""Yes, it is, isn't it,"" agrees Katy.<br />Silence. Awkward glances. Move on.<br />So anyway, the night before, after we left, they'd wound up making out pretty hardcore on Tyra's bed! I couldn't believe it. I mean, anyone else and I'd not be that surprised, but KATY. And even then, I could understand her making out withsomeone she really liked. But she barely even KNOWS Mike. It's so weird. <strong><em>[[This paragraph&nbsp;deserves a ""heh"" on so many levels...]]<br /></em></strong>And the stupidest part is that I'm JEALOUS of her for it! How come stuff like that always happens to her, and never to me? She doesn't even like liking guys, and she's usually got like no visible hormones. Yet she's had relationships and made out with people,and she doesn't even <em>want</em> it. I haven't done anything at all - I've never ever kissed a guy...like, period, like not even in Kindergarten behind the Play Kitchen, and I do want to! It's so very ironic. I'm at the point where I just want to go up to someone and ask them to kiss me! I wouldn't really, of course, but do you see what I mean?! Grrr.<br /><br />High-altitude smudges, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

I read some of his Online Journal entries, and i realized I really ought to be in love with him. He's got pretty much all the qualities I'm looking for in a guy (personality-wise) as well as being graceful and not bad looking. He's really really nice, and cuddly, and sweet, and <em>hilarious</em>, and very smart, and clever and diligent (!!!) and and and. So I should definitely be in love with him. Oh well. I'll give it time.<br /><br />We're camping right now at Glenora, near Telegraph Creek. Us, Nana and Papa, Ian and Martina, and Katy, cause when we said we were going to Telegraph Creek, she said ""Oo oo oo!"". She knows the people who own the store and Inn in Telegraph Creek, she said, but she hadn't been up here in years. I asked my mum jokingly if Katy could come, and she said yes! So Kt's here, and it's fun. We went into Telegraph today to see her people, and wow! She didn't tell us she knew HOT people in Telegraph Creek! The two guys in the family - one 18, named Travis, and one 20ish, named Ashley, are really good-looking! KT was as surprised as me or Tuna...said last time she saw them they were nerdy. Now they're not! People are pestering me to play Phase 10...I'll try to write later.<br />G'night. :)<br /></div>

I'd never read my journals aloud to anyone, or allowed anyone to read my journals...they're actually more entertaining then I'd thought. I have strange expressions...<br /><br />Anyway. We've been having fun, but we all agree that those boys should come back more often so we can look at them. The three teenagers - Ashley 9who's probably not actually a teenager anymore I suppose), Travis, and their sister, whose name eludes me for the moment, came to our campsite to visit Katy on Saturday evening. Having got a better look at them both, I've decided (and the others agree with me) that Travis is the cuter of the two. Plus he's closer to our age - I think he's eighteen. We're so sad, drooling over boys from Telegraph Creek whom none of us but Katy are ever going to see again. He is (they are) pretty hot though. I think they would be even if they were n't pretty much the only young males within a several hundred mile radius. Katy says it's very very weird, being attracted to someone she's known her whole life, but always seen as a sort of nerdy, dorky playmate rather than anything. I can understand what she means - it would be like suddenly being attracted to Paul! Ack! That would be so bizarre. I suppose he could turn into an attractive person...but I don't see how...Ouch. That was harsh. Oh well, he won't be reading this. Funny thing is, I did sort of like him at one point...but that was a million years ago and I was confused. We'd just moved out here, and I was trying to stop having a crush on Brad, cause he was all the way across the country, and I was pathetic. We saw a lot of the Gemmells those first few months, and I didn't really know anyone else here. Grade 7 was a weird year that way. Paul was still being nice at that point, too - he hadn't yet turned into a teenager in any more than the strictest sense of the word. Strange memories...<br /><br />I don't know why I'm picking now to reminisce (stupid, unspellable word!). Now I want to go into all that ancient history and talk about Brad, but to exhaust <em>that </em>topic (especially on paper) would take hours. I haven't actually thought about htose years for so long. What I really want to know, I suppose, is what he thought of me. How accurate my warped, biased perception of events was. We moved just when things were getting interesting, so I never got a chance to find out how things would have played out naturally. In Grade 4, I...""hated""...him, and I'm not sure he knew I existed. I guess he must have, though - we made his life a living hell every Recess and Lunch. We were such pills. I feel sorry for him now. In Grade 5, I still hated him, but by this point the feeling was mutual, so we had a relationship of some sort, although it consisted mainly of exchanging insults. He was in my class all three of those years - him and Joel Wilson and Michelle Henderson and Justin Sam, whom no one but me know or remember... In Grade 5, the insults stopped being physical and became verbal, as well as two-sided. It was a weird relationship.<br />In Grade 6, we sort of became friends, and that was weirder! There was still a lot of banter and ""I hate you"" thrown back and forth (like, I pretended to be annoyed when I was placed beside him in Music clsas - that sort of thing) but really we were friends under all that antipathy. we used to walk and talk together at Recess - especially that last recess on the bike rack beside the Pumphouse on the Frenchy side of the playground. *Sigh* Memories. So I wonder - did he like me? It always seemed like he did, but maybe I was reading too much into signs that were in actuality meaningless. I wish we'd moved a year later...it's not like Grade 7 in Terrace was incredibly exciting anyway, and I would have found out what happened. Oh well. What-ifs are pointless.<br /><br />...Just wanted to finish that thought before I took off on a new tangent. It's this afternoon (Monday, that is) now. This morning we went to town and took a boat ride up the Stikine River. And saw Travis! I figured it out - he reminds me of Mathieu, that guy I was so in love with at CAMMAC the summer before Grade 8. I've decided earrings on guys are definitely sexy. (Katy decided the same thing - Travis has an earring). I think she's in danger of having a crush on him...I thought that before, but now she thinks so as well, so it must be true. I'm not...I don't know him...but he's good to look at. I'm thinking also that there musn't be very many teenage girls in Telegraph Creek - he's seemed quite interested in us as well, which is amusing. I kept catching his eye, cause everytime I looked at him, he was looking at me, or at Katy or Martina. Then he would look away, embarassed. It was probably just my overactive imagination that convinced me he was looking at me, and at us. Either way, it doesn't really matter. It always amuses me when guys look at me, because it happens so rarely. It's like, what, can't you find anything more interesting to look at than this?! That sounds kind of harsh, but it's true: there's almost always someone (or something) better to look at then myself. So when they do, I find it amusing.<br /><br />It's so warm here, and I'm tanned again. I love it! It's such a nice change from the cool and damp we've been having in Terrace recently. This beach is beautiful.<br />Tomorrow morning (my birthday! I'd forgotten) we're leaving (sigh...no more Travis) to go to Stewart and see the Salmon Glacier. Then home on Wednesday.&nbsp;<br />Summer vacations (and life) always happen so fast...<br /></div>

Anyway.<br /><br />I'm going to start writing this journal entry, but I don't think I'll get very far - Tuna and Katy want to have a story time...this means me reading aloud from my journal. We started this a couple of evenings ago, and it's actually fun. I've never shared journals with anyone before, but I like doing it, I've decided, if they're the right people. Martina says that one day I should publish my journals. I don't know, though...that's like, strangers reading my private thoughts. Scary.

Its about Jon, and I don't know why, cause I hadn't been thinking about him at all. Usually, even when I do have sexual dreams, they aren't about someone who exists, or someone I know. This one was.<br />The initial part, we were sitting in school - only it wasn't the school, it was some other building - arguing. It was a verbal arguement, but...he kept...petting me, almost, playfully, but not. Then a weird non-sequitur where Will Shack came up to us - only he was huge, or rather, we were very small, like four-year-olds. We ran up to him and jumped into his arms, like he was our long-lost uncle. He scooped us up and held us each in one arm, and said, ""You know, you two should really get together."" We laughed derisively.<br />I don't know if there was an explanation within the dream for the next bit: if there was, I forget it. All of a sudden it was like a...a dam burst, or a bell rung, or a powder was released into the air, and then it was like everyone was compelled to pair up. We were twitterpated to the extreme. I was so stunned and confused - people were rushing everywhere past me, forming into couples...not only that, but they were getting <u>married</u>! No ceremonies or anything, its just that when they joined up, they were automatically married. I was standing there dazed, and Jon had disappeared, and then it was like a movie scene or a ...well, a dream sequence... - the people were still pouring past me, but they parted like a sea around me, and there was Jon standing still as well, facing me from 6 feet away. It's so cliche and tacky, but that's what happened. We stared at each other - silence in the middle of uproar - and then I blinked and he had disappeared. I searched for him amidst the couples, and once I saw him moving away ahead of me. He glanced back and saw me, but then he shrugged and kept moving away. I finally wound up outside, and wandered around feeling desolate. Everywhere I looked there was another happy couple. I looked through the brightly-lit window into the warmth inside - and there was Jon on the other side, the only other person standing alone. He'd been looking for something, but seemed about to give up, when he glanced up at the window and saw me. His face lit up so adorably, and he ran towards the door, fighting the crowd. I ran too, but when I reached the door Amanda Chan and Britt MacLoed were coming out, carrying a huge book. Jon followed them out, but he just stood behind them and watched me. Amanda flipped the book open and told me to read the page. I knelt down and read it. It was written in German, but I could read most of it. The parts that I couldn't read, Britt translated into Latin for me(!!). I can't remember the words, but it was basically a statement of love from Jon. I was so bewildered, and I looked up at him and...yeah, movie scene. The stupid part was when I kissed him - I've never kissed anyone or been kissed in real life, but it's happened numberous times in dreams, and this was absolutely the stupidest, worst kiss I've ever had in a dream. Usually kissing is sexy, but this was pointless. And yet the sentiment was wonderful. It sounds stupid now, of course, but the dream was so romantic. And I didn't make it up - it happened! Other stuff happened after that in the dream, but it was all vague and pointless. That first part, though, was so much like an actual story that it amazed me!<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Oh, I do so hate not being caught up! It makes me feel all off-kilter.""><em>Oh, I do so hate not being caught up! It makes me feel all off-kilter. </em>Tuseday was my birthday, as you know, Tuesday night I had The Dream, and Wednesday we drove home. Our only adventure for the whole trip happened that last day, onthe road that comes home through the Lava beds and New Aiyansh. One of the tired in the van blew! We went over a piece of lava accidentally and KERSPLAT! There it was. So I learned how to change a tire. That meant, of course, that the Gemmells - Ian and Martina, that is - had to stay the night with us, so their tire could be fixed inthe morning. (Their spare was only a temporary.) We watched <em>Topsy-Turvy </em>last night, a very good movie about Gilbert and Sullivan. Then, just as we had finished, the power went out; I believe about half of Terrace was out. That was at 12:30-ish, so we all just went to bed. I meant to write that night, but didn't, for obvious reasons. Unlike Eleanora, I cannot write by candlelight.<br /><br />...And quite a lot has been going on here in our absense, it appears. Hans and Cayley are on the verge of going out. I'm not sure how I feel about this...no, actually, I know exactly how I feel about it - I hate the idea - I'm just not entirely sure why. It's partly altruistic, I guess, but mostly selfish. Hans is going away to school at the end of August, and already I know just how this will play out. I know Cayley. Once they start going out, she will be smug and condescending to all of the rest of us, while appearing not to be. Then, when he leaves, she will be devastated and will mope for months...she'll be insufferable, and we'll never hear the end of it. Also, I'm afraid of how it will split up the group...they say everything (ie the harem...did you know we were Hans's concubines?) will be the same, but I know smfo. <strong><em>[[edit: ""smfo"" = ""better"". if you don't know why, ask.]] </em></strong>Everything will be awkward. He says that he will be faithful in a relationship, but he wants his friends to know that he will always be there to cuddle or provide a shoulder to cry on. Cayley says she's fine with that, but she won't be. Katy and I know that, if no one else. She's a very possessive person by nautre, and she'll hate other people touching him. The tensions between her and Tyra and Jessica will escalate, even though they say they're resigned, and Katy and I will be left on the outside, watching everything fall apart. Perhaps I'm just a cynic (goodness I hope so), but that's honestly how I see it. However, it's not up to me, it's up to them, so I've decided to be supportive regardless.&nbsp;<strong><em>[[wow, I never give Cayley a *chance*, do I? Self-fulfilling prophesy much? Ugh.]]</em></strong><br />There's another nagging, petty part of me that begs to have a voice in this too. I hate that part, and I only give it voice in this journal. Ultimately, this is the problem: I want Hans to like me. The selfishness of this attitude is compounded further by the fact that I really don't have a crush on him...but I want him to have a crush on me. He's exactly the sort of guy I want. I've expounded on all these good, <u>true</u> reasons why it's a bad idea for Cayley and Hans to start a relationship, and yet I know that if he asked <em>me</em> out, I'd say yes in a second, even though the same restrictions apply. Bottom line: he's a great guy. He'd make a great boyfriend. And, I think, awful though this sounds...I mean, Cayley's my <em>friend</em>..., I think I would make a better girlfriend for him than Cayely will. I would handle the circumstances better, and I think our personalities mesh better. Grrr. I'm so jealous of her.<br /><br />I hate this part of myself. Usually I keep it smothered, and even now, this journal is the only place I'm indulging it. I would <em>never</em>say that stuff online. <strong><em>[[ok, I kind of still agree with this sentiment, but I'm committed, now, and it's ancient history after all...]]</em></strong>. I hate being jealous, but I am mind-bogglingly jealous of Cayley, for a couple of reasons. First the Hans thing. It's not even that she's going out with Hans in particular - it's having that typre of relationship, period. I want that. I want it so bad. I'm seventeen, for crying out loud! How many girls have never kissed or gone out with a guy at that point? Probably a lot more than I think, and I'm probably overreacting, but God! If she goes out with Hans (which I must assume involves kissing, lol) I will be the <u>only</u> girl...no, scratch that, the only PERSON in our group who has never kissed a member of the opposite sex. Even Drew Barrymore wasn't that pathetic. She'd just never had a ""true love"" kind of kiss. Heck, I'd settle for any kind at all.<br />See what I mean? I hate this. I hate feeling sorry for myself. I always feel guilty, like I'm indulging in something illicit. But I know that's silly. I'm the only person I know who doesn't discuss their jealousies etc with other people. Most girls will tell anyone at all when they feel sorry for themselves. I'm at the other extreme. I've listened to too many people beg for attention and sympathy, and get it, and lap it up. I refuse to do that, cause I don't want to inconvenience or irritate people, and then I feel like a martyr, except that I hide it so well that nobody realized I have any problems <em>to</em> hide, and then I feel sorry for myself again cause no one realized I'm a martyr, and extremely jealous of those less heroic people who selfishly heap their problems on others and then get sympathy, even though <em>they're</em> not martyrs. And then I get mad cause people don't feel sorry for my martyrdom, even though if they <em>did</em> realize I was upset and commiserate with me, it would defeat the whole purpose behind my being a martyr in the first place! I am just a mass of contradictions. Grrr.<br /><br />Anyway. Still sorting things out. A cynical, depressive, confused sort of day, but with sunny patches. At least in here I can feel sorry for myself in a straight-forward manner.&nbsp;<br />More sun tomorrow hopefully! Got a million and one things to do, and am enjoying the feeling of <em>finally</em> having no one else here.<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So, I guess school's over, except for finals next Monday and Tuesday.""><em>So, I guess school's over, except for finals next Monday and Tuesday. </em>Feels so weird. I'm actually, amazingly, goiing to miss school. I won't see any of those people for 2 months. Gawd, that's so sad. How pathetically social I've become.<br /><br />It's been absolutely gorgieous (again with the stupid word...someday, I'll learn how to spell!) this whole week, sunny and warm. Yesterday and today were positvely hot. (30+ degrees.) It's not too humid, though, so I don't mind the heat. Actually quite pleasant in the shade. It's amazing how bitchy people around here can be about the weather. Imaginc <em>complaining</em> about the heat and sun! Like, hello! You live in one of the coldest, rainiest places in the country in terms of summers - enjoy this weather well it lasts. I guess, though, that living here, people's bodies just aren't acclimatized to the heat. Mine shouldn't be either, since I've lived here for five years, but I remember Southern Ontario and I remember heat waves and humidity - this is nothing!<br /><br />This last week of school has been busy, but I've really enjoyed it - particularly Socials. Cameron won that election, as I suspected he would. He got 20 votes, I got 14, Eric got 7, and Devon got 3 (Thank Goodness!) There were 3 uncountable ballots (one with a checkmark, two with the tags not torn off), all of which were for me, so technically I got 17. Which isn't bad at all, I think. This week we did a Mock Parliament Simulation, were we practiced passing bills. I was part of the Governing party (the Liberals, of course.) Eric was the Prime Minister. The simulation only lasted 2 days, cause we were out of time. I wish we could have had longer: it was fun! Our two most successful bills (the Opposition didn't even oppose them!) were the Prositution Act and the Extended Life Sentence Act. I wanted to pass one called the Excessive Public Affection Act, but we ran out of time.<br />Seriously, it's sick. I mean, I know it's spring and all, and couples have a right to be touchy, but man! The cafetria is like Makeout Central. Like, keep your tongue in your own mouth when at school Please! At least they could look for someplace more private. Makes me want to throw up.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Well, that sort of dwindled off.""><em>Well, that sort of dwindled off. </em>I lay down outside in the sun...BAAAD idea if you intend to get anythign accomplished that day.<br />I should be studying now - I've got my Biology and Socials finals tomorrow, and then I'm done - but I don't really feel like it.<br /><br />Went to Katy's cabin by the Lake on Friday with her and Beth. It was really fun - the water was so warm! Her cabin's really cool...I'd never been out there before, but I think practically everyone else in the known world has. It's got solar-powered lights, but no running water and no bathroom - just an outhouse. A couple of years ago Cameron Adam threw up all over the outhouse - thankfully, all traces are now gone. We got scared out of our wits by a stupid rabbit when we went out there at midnight. Wound up peeing in the bushes instead.<br />I think they may have converted me. We spent the entire time we were out there listening to country music - Katy and Beth both love it - and now I like it too...well, some of it. That sucks. I don't want to like <em>country</em>! I don't <em>like</em> it! (Oh yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense!) But some of it's catchy. I downloaded a bunch of the songs on Kazaa. There's one song I had to get just cause I love the title line: ""Just call me Cleopatra, cause I'm the Queen of Denial."" I think that's a great pun! It's so cute! Anyway.<br /><br />Jon is so adorable. Grrr. I really don't want to like him. He's such a prick. He's also been virtually nonexistant the past few weeks - hanging out with Cam and Brad and Brody - and it makes me so mad. How can I gaze longingly at him if he's never there?! :P<br />Travis Earl looked really sexy today too. He hasn't been lately, but today... He was wearing different clothing than normal, and his hair wasn't gelled. It looked <em>so</em> cute. Totally changes the shape of his face.<br />I'm babbling. Bother. Better go study before this gets ridiculous.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I keep wanting to write "" of="""" instead=""""><em>I keep wanting to write ""January"" instead of ""June."" </em>Don't know why...it's <em>definitely</em> not January!<br />So I'm officially out of school now for the summer. I don't know whether I'm excited or what. Feels like we're still in those classes...particularly Socials, although I'm not sure why. Just taking a break. That's the only course which I'm not taking next year as well, although I'm taking Comparative Civilizations, and that's similar. I really wish there was a class devoted to Government and mock Parliament and stuff - the would be so cool! Like, a scenario-based course. I had way more fun in the last two weeks of Socials than I had in the entire rest of that course. I love arguing! (Sorry - ""debating""...whatever. Same thing.) Ms Geier thinks I'm wonderful. She told Cameron and I we should go into politics, as we were very ""charismatic speakers"" and ""thoughtful individuals."" I <em>didn't </em>say ""not in a million years,"" but I thought about it.<br /><br />Ironically, my easiest finals were Math and Socials, both of which I was worried about, and my tough ones were Biology, which I expected to be easy, and Physics. On every single Biology test, Mr Jones put the question ""What is Biology?"" for multiple choice.The answer is ""The Study of Life."" I laughed so hard at the options he gave for that question on the Final, though. there were only two: ""The study of life"" or ""a class where you sit and play with the taps."" I just about killed myself - that's <em>exactly</em> what people do in that class. I don't htink they realize he notices...<br /><br />Watched ""About a Boy"" at the theatre this evening with Cayley and Katy. It was a <em>really good</em> movie. About Hugh Grant being an asshole - it's actually a perfect role for him. The plot is interesting - it's about the relationship between a screwed-up kid and this useless, insensitive single asshole - and the monologue and dialogue is hilarious! Plus the soundtrack was good. We loved it!<br /><br />Cameron Adam is smart and nice and thoughtful (as much as can be expected, anyway) and cute. Why don't I have a crush on him? It would be so easy. Way better than having what amounts to a crush on stupid Jon Rife. Grrr. But Jon's so adorable. I don't get him. Sometimes he looks at me like he's interested, but his whole personality and demeanor says he isn't. So, what?! It's so annoying. He'd be fine to have a crush on if I hadn't finally reached the point where I'm looking for reciprocity in a relationship, but I think that, unfortunately, I have. *sigh*<br />Hormonal (as usual) smudges, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Kurt and Mark Biagioni are so completely different physically, mentally, and socially, it's amazing to think they're brothers. ""><em>Kurt and Mark Biagioni are so completely different physically, mentally, and socially, it's amazing to think they're brothers. </em>Aside from their eyes, noses, and a few expressions and gestures, there is no discernable similarity between them.<br />Kurt, as you know, has extremely curly hair, glasses, and a quiet, withdrawn, extremely weird personality. Also, he sucks at sealing with females and is probably the least obviously sexual teenaged guy I know.<br />Mark is the total opposite. He's got straight (mussy) dark hair which bears no resemblance to Kurt's ringlets. He's not obviously birhgt (although I think he is, really) and he's got a very open, silly personality. And (here's the big one) he's <em>such </em>a <em>player! </em>He flirts with and hits on absolutely everything female. And he's so obvious it'spainful. He does it on purpose and it doesn't mean anything, but he does it all the time. Like, to everyone. He can't pass up the chance for a one-liner. We (lots of people) were at the hotsprings this evening (lived here for five years and I'd never been there!), and I think he managed to hit on every single one of us...<br /><br />It might be creepy or offensive if it were anyone else, but Mark is...Mark. Everyone knows he's joking, but it's still kind of fun and flattering. Plus I think he's adorable. That's so sad...he's like, 2 years younger than us. He says he likes ""older women"". Whatever. But he is cute - I really like his hair, and his build - like Jon, he's ""cut"". And not too tall. (Give him time, I know). Anyway, we hardly ever see him, but it's fun looking at him when we do, and being hit on, particularly by a cute, non-creepy guy (even one who's amazingly horny and completely not serious) is an interesting experience. The only other guy who does that to me is Ken, and that's just plain creepy.<br /><br />Got pictures back today that I'd forgotten I had. Old photos, from like, October. The murder-mystery thing, and Cayley's Christmas party. Back when Jon wasn't an asshole. Ah, memories...<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""We just watched a really cool, creepy movie.""><em>We just watched a really cool, creepy movie. </em>It's a roman Polanski film called <em>The Ninth Gate</em>, starring Johnny Depp. As you can imagine from the title, it's about Hell and summoning the Devil - very bizarre. But interesting, and some beautiful filming, particularly the last scene. Unfortunately, Johnny Depp isn't nearly as cute as he was in <em>Chocolat; </em>he wore glasses, had a beard, and his hair was short. Oh well.<br /><br />Yesterday evening we had our Senior Recital. I should have got you to wish us luck, cause man, we needed it. I played Bumble Boogie and Someone to Watch Over Me, which I dedicated to Hannah. I played the Bumble Boogie at the end of the first half, so my fingers were completely cold. That piece sounds really awesome if your fingers work, but when they're cold it's just a mistake. Someone To Watch Over Me was less obviously flawed, but the memory wasn't very strong, and the performance could have been a lot tighter. Manda and I did our duet last thing, though, and it was awesome! We walked on with sparkly dresses and carnations between our teeth - it was so cute. And the beginning of our piece was a surprise - we didn't even tell Bonnie. We sat down, counted...and started playing Heart and Soul! It was so hilarious! We spent actually quite a good deal of time the past week or so figuring how to modulate efficiently from Heart and Soul to Bolero. We finally got it, and it actually sounds really neat. Even Bonnie, although initially shocked, thought it was funny. At the end, we blew kisses and tossed our flowers into the audience. We were the last act, and <em>definitely</em> a good way to end the night.<br /><br />Danny Chapman, Hannah Huston, Katy, and David came to watch us, and afterwards me, Manda, Hayley Sullivan, and them hung out (minus David, the hermit.) Then we lost Hayley and went to Manda's to watch the <em>Holy Grail</em>. Somehow, that turned into topless back massages. (A wonderful pastime). I think Danny must think I'm weird now - they made Hannah (who pushes hard, but isn't as good as Eric) give me one so that those who had missed the experience could hear me squeal. Then Danny did it, except he didn't push hard enough. Then I did Danny (shut up!) and probably pushed too hard, although he said he enjoyed it. He smelled really nice - like sweat, but very faintly. I know most people don't think of that as a good smell, but I like the smell of mature male sweat, in moderation. I think that's probably cause I associate it with Riley and Stephen and being little, so it's a comfortable smell. Anyway. I'm weird.<br /><br />Then last night (still) I slept over at Katy's house, which was easier than going home at 2am. We got hardly any sleep - we talked until almost four. We woke up at ten, went to my place, and hung out there till 3:30 pm...basically just talking all the time. It's really nice to have someone you don't run out of things to say to.<br /><br />This afternoon was the longest night of the year (summer solstice), so Karla and Graham had a mini-party to celebrate. Dad is in Abbotsford, so it was them, us minus Dad, Barry and Marian, Barry's teenage daughter Anna, and Marrianne and her husband. Marianne is amazingly opinionated - about everything! I liked Anna; she seems like an interesting person. She's live in the UAE (United Arab Emirates, for the geography/acronym-challenged) for 2 years, and then Sweden last year. She graduated last year, but she was a grade ahead, so I guess she'd be a year older than me. We exchanged phone numbers - she doesn't know anybody in Terrace, so I promised to invite her next time we go somewhere, and introduce her to all my crazy friends.<br /><br />Tyra's having a sleepover-tent-type thing tomorrow night. Should be fun.Or stupid. Or both. Whatever.<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Hans Seidemann is a very interesting person.""><em>Hans Seidemann is a very interesting person. </em>He was at Tyra's house with us last night, and every time I see him I have more respect for him. He's very bright, and thoughtful, and artistic (obviously), and dedicated. Plus really nice, and absolutely hilarious... Really, I ought to have a crush on him. Shame I don't. Yet, anyway. He talked to me and Katy (Katy and I?) for a long time, and we had an interesting conversation, cause he's interested in Linguistics (!!) - like, Latin and Greek and stuff - and Physics, which Katy and I keep bringing up accidentally (we're <em>such </em>nerds.) We have a similar taste in books and movies, and he likes Monty Python! Very cool.<br /><br />Anyway, last night was really fun, and not just because of Hans, although I suspect he pretty much tied the group together. Travis was hanging out with Tyra's younger sister and the other Grade 9's, Eric's in Vancouver having ear surgery, and Jon wasn't there, so if Hans had been absent we would have had Kurt and a lot of girls. And no offense, but lately I've been finding Kurt kind of boring. Plus Cayley usurps him all the time anyway, so we would have had the Cayley-Kurt cuddle session in the corner, plus a lot of really bored girls. As it was, we had a great time. There were (initially) seven of us in my ancient Timberline tent, and we played ""Honey If You Love Me"" and ""Truth of Dare"". As people got tired, they left for the other tent, so we wound up with myself, Katy, Tyra, and Hans in the tent. And had a blast. I'm very proud of myself for being the <em>only</em> one out of 5 people who could crack Hans at Honey If You Love Me. That was <em>with </em>touching and ad-libbing and it still took me a bloody long time. I wound up talking about toes and various bodily orifices...luckily (and surprisingly) he laughed before I actually had to <u>do</u> anthing with toes and orifices. I was proud and relieved. No one else got him. He's also an amazing masseur...I hate to say this, but he may be better than Eric! And that's saying something!<br /><br />The rain was fun, too. I was really stupid and set up the ground sheet entirely wrong, so we wound up with a lake. We ought to have at least noticed, and moved things...it's not like we were asleep. We stayed up til about 6:30am, the four of us. And I wasn't even tired! It was so bizarre.<br />So anyway. I invited Hans to my birthday party on Friday, though I don't know if he'll make it. Hope so - it's always nicer to have a higher male contingent, and he's so cool!&nbsp;<br />I'm gushing. Caitlin, shut up.<br />I could write more (I've more to write about) but I got 2/3 hours sleep last night and now, finally, I'm tired.<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

So finally, we got tired of waiting and drove to Ferry Island, where we caught tadpoles. Travis started out nice, but then he became really stupid and really really horny, which was irritating. There's no bigger turn-off than a horny guy (ironically enough.) He asked us to give him a hand-job. We said Eww no. He asked us to give him a <u>blowjob</u>. We said definitely <em>not</em>. He said Mr Nordin and Captain Planet were his heroes. He said he wanted Kurt to give him a blowjob. Or Steven, Kurt's older brother. We smiled and nodded.<br />Then we got ahold of the others, who were at Tyra's, so we went there. Travis and Mike went off with LIndsay and Lindy (I'm not sure I even want to know...no seriously, it's bad), and the rest of us played ""Honey If you Love me..."", which, I must grudgingly admit, was fun. Driving Travis home, he told me that the girls want to know if he and Mike wanted relationships. He was asking my advice...it was sort of cute, in an ironic way. He said it was a really confusing situation and he didn't know what to do. I said no shit. He wondered what he would tell his parents. I said I seemed to recall that <em>he</em> asked <em>me</em> out not so very long ago, so he must have given at least some passing thought to the situation. He said uh, yeah, well, umm.... I told him not to rush into anything he wasn't prepared for, but also not to expect physical attention from girls without giving some degree of emotional commitment in return. He said I sounded like his mother. I said maybe he should listen to his mother occasionally - she clearly gave good advice. :p Anyway. At least (this is the selfish upshot) it gets him out of my hair once and for all.<br />Tick tick tick.<br /><em>Never criticize someone until you've walked a mile in his shoes.

There were an hour and a half of Scholarships and that was especially dull. I hate clapping, and I hate being clapped at. People seem to be paranoid about silence: as soon as a speaker pauses for breath, they have to clap again. They clap when the announcer comes out; the clap when the award winner's name is announced; they clap when the person comes up; they clap when the hands are shaken, they clap as the person returns to his seat. I got fed up early on, and decided toclap only three times for each person, just to save my poor hands. I got awards for English, Socials, Math, and Stagecraft, but not CAPP or any of the Sciences (I was kind of surprised by that, but oh well. Que sera...) I also (and this I'm proud of) got the Most Outsanding Grade 11 Student, along with Kim Smith. That means we tied for highest percent average during the year. I didn't expect to get that award. I was so surprised when Mr Wootton announced my name, I practically jumped! Then he had to talk about me, you know, and how wonderful I am, and like that. It was embarassing, but kind of fun. Katy was in the audience, and I could see her laughing her head off when he walked about my ""inquisitive"" nature, etc. She knows the truth.<br /><br />Anyway.

I don't want to rave and ramble again, but wow. And he's so well-rounded. Goodness. I suspect a developing crush mainly because of my reaction to his attentions towards Cayely. Not that they were anything - that's the thing. But she's rapidly developing a huge crush on him (like, bigger than Kurt) and so, being Cayley, she's throwing herself at him. It embarasses me, watching her. And yet, the irritating thing is, it seems to work. I hate that, cause I am not a forward person by nature, and could never do it. The playing field is not level. Anyway, we did quizzes, which were interesting, as usual. Jon didn't do it properly (on purpose) but Kurt and Hans did, and their answers were...enlightening. Hans would go out (he says) with me or Cayley if either of us asked him. (Of course, that's really really hard to tell until you're actually in the situation - as I know.) His first choice for a one-night stand is Cayley - second choice is me - and he wants Cayley on his desert island. Obviously, then, if Cayley throws herself at him, he's going to respond. And it was making me jealous! Like, bitchy-mood jealous. Usually, jealousy is one of those feelings I can hide well enough that it doesn't look like anything bothers me. Yesterday, I almost let it show... Anyway. Liking Hans would not be a bad thing - he's exactly the sort of person I should like, plus he's going to SFU next year so it doesn't matter anyway.<br />Kurt's answers to that survey were strange too, btw. He said he'd go out with me or Cayley if we asked (not true, but maybe he doesn't realize that), but for the one-night stand and Island questions, his answers were backwards. He put <em>me</em> first for the one-night stand and Cayley second, instead of the other way round, and I'm on his island. Bizarre. Plus he said my most attractive physical characteristics were my breasts (!!) and my ""body shape in general."" So strange. So not what I was expecting from Kurt.<br />Anyway, I'm so so tired - way too little sleep the last two nights - but I'll do my utmost to write tomorrow.<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /><br /><strong><em>[[sidenote: this was Harem-creation night and I didn't even *mention* it in my journal!

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Thank you so much, Kitty - today was absolutely beautiful - first time in weeks!""><em>Thank you so much, Kitty - today was absolutely beautiful - first time in weeks! </em>Had fun this evening. It was a great night for a water fight&nbsp;- 5 degrees warmer and it would have been perfect - and we all got thoroughly soaked. There were about 17 people there - us, Lyndsay Weitman's friends, five rupertites, and various hangers-on (""friends and relations""...) Initially it was Terrace vs Rupert, but that quickly disintegrated into an every-man-(woman and child)-for-his-or-her-self kind of battle. Which was more fun anyway. Then we watched <em>Rocky Horror</em> - we had to deflower 4 Rocky virgins - Lance, Hans, andrew (a guy from Rupert), and Mark, Kurt's younger brother. We were so loud during the movie, however, that I doubt they heard much of the dialogue or understood much of the plot. Might as well have seen it in a theatre (something I definately want to do some day!)<br /><br />Hans Seidemann is a very interesting person, not to mention a nut. I swear, he's crazy. But <em>so</em> funny - he's hilarious to watch. Plus smart, and graceful...Cayley's in definite danger of having a crush on him, and I must say I can see why...<br /><br />Mark...is attractive. Unfortunately, he's also in grade 9, which makes attraction to him weird and bordering on pedophilia. But why, then, is it okay for guys to like girls two years younger, but not vice-versa? Cultural stigmas are irritating. Not that I could actually <em>like </em>Mark anyway. I haven't sepnt much time around him, but he strikes me as arrogant and self-centred, and extremely aware of his looks. Nevertheless, eh's adorable, in much the same way Jon is. Instigates that ""I want to touch you"" reaction. Sigh.<br /><br />Whew. Water-fighting is tiring work.<br />goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Finally convinced my dad to let us get KaZaA on the games computer upstairs!""><em>Finally convinced my dad to let us get KaZaA on the games computer upstairs! </em>It's so exciting. I've downloaded a bunch of songs, mostly ones I've wanted forever, plus some ones from CDs I've lost. Eric's really into Queen (again, the sexual ambiguity!), and I downloaded a bunch of their songs. I <em>love</em> Bohemian Rhapsody, and I also really really like The Bike Song and Fat-Bottom Girls (although that one makes me feel self-conscious - I'm the epitome of fat-bottom girl!)) I got lots of Harry Nilsson songs, and the Barenaked Ladies' ""This is me in Grade 9"" which is hilarioius cause I know exactly what it's talking about. Half my friends are crazy and the others are depressed... Of course, I've also got some songs which I couldn't resist, even though I'm embarassed to admit I like them. A good example is ""The Bad Touch"" by the Bloodhound Gang. If you were alive and conscious in the year 2001, you know the song...""You 'n' me, baby, ain't nothing' but mammals, so lets do it like they do on the Discovery Channel..."" Yeah, you know. It's a pretty dumb song, and the philosophy is somewhat questionable (understatement of the year!), but I love it! The lyrics are so cute - ""so put your hands down my pants, and I bet you'll feel nuts; you make me rise an hour early just like Daylight Savings Time."" I think a large part of why I like it, however, is the memories it invokes.<br />Probably the most sexual experience I've ever had, strange as this may sound, is slow-dancing with Jon. (I'm not sure whether I like him partly because of that or whether I liked that partly because I like him, but the two are definitely related.) I've only ever danced with him twice - once at Lindsay's house, and once at the Video Dance. I think I've talked about this before: since he's so small and not a million miles taller than me, we fit very well together. When we dance, then, we wind up touching all the way up and down, with no space visible between us. This was quite a sexual experience for me, and I just wanted to be there forever. Anyway, I don't remember what song we danced to at the Video Dance, but it was the very last song they played before sutting down. Earlier, they'd played The Bad Touch (as a fast song, of course) and when the dance ended, that was the song I had in my head. But the experience I had in my head was of dancing with Jon, and somehow the two got intertwined in my brain. Now whenever I hear that song, I think about that. As a result, I like the song. (Incidentally, it's also about the closest to horny that I get when I'm not ovulating. If you ever want to get me aroused...!!)<br /><br />Got our yearbooks this week, too. They aren't very well done, but you've got to give the club credit - it was a rush job, and there weren't a whole lot of people involved. I think I may have to join again next year, just to make sure that the end product meets my standard. The best part about annuals though, of course, isn't what's inside, but rather all the signatures and messages people put on the inside covers. People are so funny, and the things they write capture their personalities perfectly! Kelso, for example, wrote to remind me of the time we ""got all liquored up and had mad sex on the piano"", which is just exactly like Kelso.<br /><br />In Socials this week, we've been learning about the election process, and we held a mock election, in conjunction with Mr Harrison's class. I stuck up my hand to volunteer for the NDP candidacy, just to look like I was participating - I didn't actually want to do it. However, everyone else in the NDP decided I had to be the candidate - as Matt put it: ""You're smart, you use big, confusing words, and no one's got a personal grudge against you."" So I was in. My opponents were Devon Mercer (an idiot) for the Canadian Alliance; Eric (Beaupre) for the Liberals; and Cam Adam for the Progressive Conservatives. We each had to prepare a speech to present to the electorate which outlined out platforms. It was a Federal election, but it only covered the Skeena Riding so Federal and Regional issues were both discussed. Then we had a question period. <em>That</em> was tough. It's one thing to read a prepared speech to a class; it's quite another to have to stand up and answer questions on the spot off the top of your head. And they were really tough questions, too, pertaining to issues such as abortion, euthanasia, bulk water exports, offshore oil drilling, etc. We all had difficulties, but the funny thing was that, although we were supposed to be representing the different parties, for the most part our opinions on the issues were similar, and our arguments were similar. Thus it became desirable to be the first to speak, since otherwise you sounded like a copycat. It was also interesting having three smart candidates and one stupid one - poor Devon never knew anything about the issues, so for the most part he didn't say much.<br />Once it was over, and the ballots were being cast, I realized I'd had fun. It was very stressful, particularly the question period, but it was exacting and exhilerating at the same time. CAmeron and Eric felt the same way. We'd just finished voting when the bell rang, so the results won't be tallied til Monday. I'm so mad. I want to know who won <em>now! </em>My money is on Cameron, personally. I think he came across the best, he countered the questions well, and his policies coincide with the mindsets of many of the people in the classes.<br />Oh well. It was fun,and as long as Devon doesn't win (please God!) I'll be happy.<br />Only one full week of school left. Can you believe it?!<br />Wish Lowell luck on his piano exam tomorrow. Grade five!!<br />Gnite, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It's strange discovering you have a twin, especially when you've already not had one for almost 17 years.""><em>It's strange discovering you have a twin, especially when you've already not had one for almost 17 years. </em>But Katy and I have decided we must be twins in some other dimension or something - nothing else could explain our remarkable similarities. Like, we feel the same about practically everything. Well, no, that's not necessarily true - it's our approach to things, how we view and understand them, that is the same. Ideologically, we vary on a couple of major points: mainly the fact that she's very religious and I'm not religious in any way at all. She's strongly Christian, but...its okay all the same. Usually I avoid the subject of religion, well, religiously, unless I'm sure I'm talking to an atheist or an agnostic. Zealots are just too hard to handle: I don't have a problem with people being religious, but others often have a problem with my lack of religion, and its best to just avoid those conversations altogether - I'm not a confrontational person by nature. With Katy, however, I can talk about religion and its related topics. (Evolution/creationism, etc). She's very open-minded, and accepts others' opnions without taking offense. She has the same problem talking with atheists as I tend to have with theists - she says she feels blamed and scorned, and it makes her mad. We're both interested in the concepts (particularly the Evolution thing) and it's really neat to be able to talk about that kind of thing from someone that's starting from the opposite end of the spectrum. Since we're both open-minded and non-confrontational, we can have intersting, rational discussions about controversial topics without pissing each other off. It's like we're approaching from differen t starting points, but at the same angle. Or something. It makes her an interesting person to talk with, cause we don't just spend the whole time agreeing with each other. We've also discovered that, aside from that one glaring difference, we have a lot of similar opinions about issues. We have similar interests, we like the same books, we've got the same peculiar quirks, and we often reach the same conclusions at virtually the same time. It's sort of scary. Raises the whole nature vs nurture debate. We come from very different backgrounds, and yet we're so similar. About the only place we don't agree is on the guys we like, which is good cause <em>that </em>would suck! If I like anyone, it's Jon Rife. Ironically, I suspect that he likes Katy milkly, but she doesn't like him. At the moment she's got semi-crushes (meaning she's actively fighting them but becoming resigned) on three guys: David Johnstone, Chris Chapman, and Haydn Johnstone. David and Haydn aren't relaed, which makes it even funnier that they have the same last name. The only one of those guys I can see liking is David, but I don't find him at all physically attractive.<br />I'm worried, however (speaking of crushes) that I may wind up having a crush on Cameron Kelso. Normally, I don't ever have crushes on guy swith girlfriends (they're out of bounds) but Cam's so sweet! He's one of the nicest guys my age I know. I mean, he's nice to <em>everyone</em>. And he's cute. Not as cute (or different-cute) as Cameron Adam, but cute. But he's got a girlfriend, and they make an adorable couple, so I'm doing my utmost to discourage the notion. A summer will doubtless help...<br /><br />I've more I could write (memo to self: <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>), but it's nearly 2am and I think we're going to the lake tomorrow.<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /><br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Yesterday (Sunday) was absolutely gorgieous (I hate that word!), as was today, for that matter.""><em>Yesterday (Sunday) was absolutely gorgieous (I hate that word!), as was today, for that matter. </em>Cayley, Katy, Eric, and I went to the lake yesterday afternoon and had a wonderful time basking and gossiping about all the things teenagers usually gossip about. We swam, too - the water was a bit cold, but once you got in (and your body went numb!) it was alright. The top foot of water was quite bearable. Foolish Cayley and Eric only waded, but Katy and I swam out a good ways. I sunburned my back, but the rest of me's just nicely tanned.<br /><br />Beautiful weather again today, as I said, so I wore my little blue dress. It's so pretty! Two years ago, I wouldn't have even considered wearing it. I hated dresses, and <em>particularly</em> short ones. This one's about to my knees - actually very modest, considering it's a summer dress (however, that's mainly cause my legs are so short).<br /><br />There's this annoying, though bright, kid in my Socials class named Barry...something. Wolfenden? I'm not sure. He's that sort of blustery, confrontational know-it-all cynical opinionated showoff who gets on practically everyone's nerves - especially teachers. However, he is smart, and he reads, um, voraciously, for lack of a better word. The only other people in that class (and probably in our grade) who read <em>real</em> books (like, not fluff and not entirely Scifi/Fantasy oriented...like, literature!) are Travis Earl (the beautiful asshole) and myself. Barry loves to argue about books, and on Friday (or Thursday; I forget and it doesn't matter) he ""informed"" me that I had to read ""A Clockwork Orange"" cause he wanted someone besides Travis to argue about it with. I asked Dad about it, and he said it was a rather bleak, depressing novel in the style of <em>1984</em>, which didn't surprise me cause that's just exactly the sort of thing Barry always reads. Stanley Kubrick made a movie of it, which Dad and I watched Saturday night. It was quite disturbing and surreal - I'm interested now to read the book<strong><em>. [[I still haven't read it. Urr</em></strong>.]] Barry says that the movie in no way does justice to it. However, that could just be Barry.<br />I was asking everyone yesterday if anyone had read it - they hadn't but Cayley said something odd. She said that, according to Kassi Thomspsen, Barry likes me, or he would ""if I weren't emotionless."" I <em>am </em>not emotionless - this diary is, if anything, a testament to that fact. I wonder if he meant if <u>he</u> weren't emotionless? That's also not true, but it does sound like something Barry would say about himself. 'Sfunny, cause I never would have suspected Barry of liking me, but all the same, it doesn't shock me nearly as much as it did when I found out Travis like me, even though I'd sort of suspected that one for a while. I think it's because, if anyone was going to like me, the person it ought to be is Barry. He's the sort of guy who should like me, cause he doesn't really care about appearances at all, and he certainly doesn't care about popularity, but he's definitely concerned with intelligence. I don't think he could like anyone (or even stand being around anyone) who's mind he couldn't respect. I'm likely the smartest (or at least most cynical) girl in our grade at Cal, and definitely the best-read. So at least there are reasons for him to like me, even if it is still ridiculous. When we did those compatability tests earlier this year, Barry matched with me at 98%, which is terrifying - I definitely don't want to be like Barry! With Travis, it doesn't make any sense. I still can't imagine what could possibly have attracted him to me - we're so completely different, and I'm not even pretty!<br /><br />Actually, that compatability thing was pretty funny all the way round... Jon rife, Travis Earl, and Cam Kelso were <em>all</em> in my list of 10! I have this vague suspicion that Chris England has a minor crush on me (again, no idea why), and both he and Barry are also on the list! Who knows - maybe those things actually work after all!<br />Sweet dreams, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Everyone is gone (and soon coming back, I believe) from movies;""><em>Everyone is gone (and soon coming back, I believe) from movies; Spiderman </em>and <em>Star Wars; Episode 2, </em>both of which I am eager to see, which by exhaustion I was prevented by going to see. Instead I stayed here and had quite a pleasant time bathing, reading, and cleaning the room. It is almost certain that, had I gone to a movie, I should have fallen asleep in the middle of it, I am so ridiculously tired. The reason is a peculiar, indeed an explicable one, and is as follows:<br /><br />Yesterday evening we determined to go to bed early, since a lack of sleep had been a notable characteristic of the last few days. The choir was set to sing this morning at eight am, which meant that those of us involved were to be on the bus by seven. Accordingly, we kicked everyone out of our room by eleven last night, set our alarm for six, and went to sleep.&nbsp;<br />The clock showed the right time as we locked the door and turned off the light, I swear it. Yet the 6am alarm seemed to come awfully early, and the sky was not yet lightening. At 6:45 by our clock, fifteen minutes before the bus's scheduled departure, no one was stirring in the hallways around us. At last, we questioned the veracity of the clock, comparing it with the television and my watch. Sure enough, our suspicions were correct: it was, in fact, 4:45am, two hours earlier than the time shown on our clock...a clock which had most assuredly been right the last time we were conscious.<br /><br />So what happened? We are as yet at a loss. Either some one got into our room while we were all sleeping and changed the clock, while disturbing nothing else (which seems highly unlikely) or else one of us reset the insturment. Such certainly seems as though it must be the case, but none can recall doing such a thing, and [it] is not such an easy task to attempt while asleep/unconscious, unless one has previous familiarity with the object (which none of us has), for to change the settings requires the depression of two buttons at once. In addition, nothing on the desk around the phone was disturbed, which suggests a culprit who was conscious of his actions at the time.<br />At any rate, I found it a disturbing situation. Two things, in addition, became clear to me as a result of this incident: first, our reliance on gadgetry and technology to organize and run our lives, and secondly, our absolute acceptance of these devices as true, despite what our senses tell us to the contrary. (It should not be pitch dark at 6:30 am in Northern Canada in May!<br /><br />Leaving this even behind for the moment...<br />Our choir performed very well. I think, in fact, that it was probably the best performance we've done of those or any other pieces. The adjudicator talked about achieving a hollow tone quality, as practically all adjudicators do, but I found his approach particularly helpful. (I wonder what they work on once you've got that one down?!) I don't know what class we got, but I'm better Bronze or Silver. I think we deserve silver, but I wouldn't be surprised or disappointed with a bronze. AS Eric put it, ""Who cares what the fucking mark is? <em>We</em> know we did well!"" I got the Honor Award for choir. They give one to a single participant in each group, chosen by the director. It's based on commitment and skill. So that's kind of cool.<br />Concert Band was this afternoon. I thought it went well too, although I don't really know enough about it to say for sure. They had awesome timpanis! It was so cool! To begin with, there were four of them, which certainly made life easier, but the really cool part was that they had tuning bars on the side that told you what note you were on. Such luxury! It was awesome!<br /><br />I think tomorrow we get to sleep in (thank God!) and then Jazz Band performs in the afternoon. And we drive home on Sunday - the band trip's almost over! *Sigh*<br />I'm going to sleep now, I think. I'm so tired.<br /><br />PS. You should see the shirt Katie made me buy today. It's a black tank top and it says ""Good girls are bad girls that don't get caught."" She says it's ""<em>So </em>me"". ...I dunno, I always thought myself better than that! Anyway. Gnight, Kitty. :)<br />(I apologise for the haughty, peculiar tone this entry likely took, btw - I'm sure it was annoying. I couldn't help it though, you see - I've been reading <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, and there've been a lot of letters recently (stupid Lydia took up with bad Wickham), and they all sound like that. Anyway, apologies. :)<br /></div>

We got silver. Funny thing - our adjudicator was the son of the adjudicator we had at the local festival! They have very different styles. And I was amazed - he didn't even <em>mention</em> the rhythm section. Adjudicators sometimes like us a lot and sometimes really don't, but they always say <em>something. </em>Not this fella.<br /><br />Didn't go to the Participants' Dance Saturday night. I wanted to, but I was tired, and dizzy from going on too many (actually, one) really spinny twisty ride at Callaway Amusement Park that evening. Heard lots of interesting things about the dance though... Yes, let your imagination run wild; that <em>is </em>what I'm talking about. Think about it: 7000 horny, geeky teenagers stuffed into one room in the darkness with loud, sexual music. What would you do? According to Tyra, it was like ""Dry Sexy City"". Lots of people making out with people they'd known for 15 minutes. Eric and Jon both hooked up with Grade 9 girls from other schools. Grade 9! That's practically cradle-robbery, <em>especially</em> if you don't know the person beforehand. Eric was covered in sparkles from head to foot; Cayley said he looked like he'd ""blown a clown"". Hmm. Now <em>that's </em>a disturbing image. Anyway. Bus ride back didn't seem as long as I thought it would.<br />Unpacked, slept, and did homework today (not in that order.) School tomorrow. Blah.<br />Fun trip, though. :) Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Antibiotics are wonderful things.""><em>Antibiotics are wonderful things. </em>I've only taken 3 doses, and already I feel miles better than I did this afternoon.<br />I've got strep throat. Actually, a number of people from the band trip have it: Katy, Eric, Aisling, and Chris Chapman, to name a few. I guess we just spent too much time in close quarters. Cayley asked if we'd had a secret orgy and didn't tell her. I said I didn't think so... ;) So I've missed the last two days of school, which isn't good since we just got back and not really caught up yet. Not much use worrying, though.<br /><br />I was thinking about masturbation. Seems like a strange thing to be thinking about, I know. that last night on the bus, Katy, Jon, Cameron Adam, Brody, and Brian Wyatt played a Truth or Dare game which was mostly Truth. I came in for about the last 1/2 hour before we got home, by which point it had basically disintegrated into a discussion about masturbation. Jon was refusing to participate, and didn't want me to, either - he said I already knew too much about him. I couldn't think what he meant - I don't know anything about Jon, cause he never tells us a thing - until I realized what they were talking about. When we did that Quiz thing a few months back (remember?), one of hte guys' questions was: ""How often do you jerk off?"" The things were supposed to be confidential, if you'll recall, but there weren't many guys there that night, and we sort of figured out whose was whose. I guess that must have been what he didn't want me to share with Cam, Brody, and Brian. Not that I would have dreamed of it anyway!<br />It was a strange conversation. Guys whack off a <em>lot</em>, although most don't do it daily...anymore! Most of them said they used to, though. Then they asked Katy and me if either of us had ever masturbated. We said no, emphatically. ""I think it's more of a <em>process</em> for girls than it is for guys,"" we said. ""Let's face it, all you have to do is rub.""<br />""But why <em>wouldn't </em>you want to masturbate?"" They asked.<br />""Well,"" we said, ""for that matter, why <em>would</em> we?""<br />They looked at each other and shook their heads. ""Try it,"" said Brody, ""And then ask us that again.""<br />When I related this conversation to Eric at school on Tuesday, he laughed and laughed. I guess that's so, though. I mean, I can't think of a good reason to spend all the time you must have to spend to masturbate, but then - how would I know? I've never done it! Still, though, that's sick. The whole idea kind of disgusts me. It's almost sad, too, in a way. Plus, I wouldn't even know how to go about it! <strong><em>[[Wow. Just...wow.]]<br /><br /></em></strong>Why am I talking about this anyway? Goodness, I am a strange child. And an ill one.<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

I'm still sick - my whole head feels like it's about to explode. Funny ; this kind of round, almost girly writing seems very upbeat and well. It belies its true nature.<br /><br />Reading a book by Margaret Atwood called <em>Lady Oracle</em>. It's about a woman whose life has been a series of lies, who is once again trying to reinvent herself. It's quite funny, and its making me want to write a romance novel; the protagonist is (secretly) a write of escapist novels, and the ""actual"" story is intersperced with bits of the manuscript she's writing. It's interesting, anyway. Mum's been telling me for years that I ought to read some Margaret Atwood, and this is the first I've tried.<br /><br />We watched a movie this evening, about drag queens. Can't remember the name off the top of my head. Robin Williams owns a drag queen show place, and is the partner of his lead, er, actress, an extremely flamboyant transvestite named Alred. Robin Williams himself does not dress in drag - although it wouldn't be the first time...remember <em>Mrs Doubtfire? </em>Anyway, his son wants to marry the daughter (played by Callista Flockhart - Alli MacBeal) of an influential US Republican Senator, and the two try to pass Robin Williams off as a ""Cultural Attache to Greece"" when her parents come for dinner.

This has nothing to do with anything, and I'm not really sure why I brought it up...<br /><br />I recently fell into the Solitaire game on our computer, and now I'm addicted. It's not ordinary Solitaire - it's called ""Spider Solitaire,"" and is a very different game. It has varying levels of difficulty; at the moment I winn all the time on Moderate (2 suits) and never on Difficult (4 suits). (Actually, that's not true. The very first time I played it on four suits I won it, just by pure chance. However, it hasn't happened since.) But you don't care anyway, I know. No one is interested in other people's solitaire games.<br /><br />We watched <em>Cast Away</em> this evening - with Tom Hanks. I think I could handle being marooned on a desert island, so long as there was someone else with me - alone I'd go crazy. I'd need someone else - someone who was interesting to talk to, that I didn't hate. And, I suppose, preferably male and around my own age. (I mean, come on, you've got to have <em>something</em> to do!) I think I wouldn't mind being on a desert island with Jon. Oric Eric. Cameron Adam, Cameron Kelso, maybe maybe Travis Earl, although I think that could get really annoying and we might eventually kill one another. But there are lots of guys with whom that scenario would be okay..<br /><br />I've got the usual weekend tasks to perform tomorrow - cleaning and French. I didn't clean my room or do any French last weekend cause I was sick, so I'm behind on both fronts. Tomorrow evening we're having a water fight at Tyra's house. I hope it's warm and sunny! Hans Seidemann and (I think) a few other people (someone called Andrew?) are coming from Rupert. Tyra's been cultivating Hans - you know how she does that. He's a good candidate - he's a very interesting person, and definately not run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, its really a bit late to cultivate him since he graduates this year.<br />And we graduate next year! Gawd. That's too terrifying to contemplate. Tonight is Prom, and in just 365 days... Ooh, it's too scary. I don't want to have to take responsibility for my life. Only a year...<br /><br />Sigh. Please put in a good word with the weather gods and make tomorrow warm and sunny. Please!!<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Man, what is WITH me this year?!!""><em>Man, what is WITH me this year?!!</em> My attention and attraction seems to be divided between two complete assholes: Jon Rife and Travis Earl. Jon you already know about. He's a prick, and I know it, but he's SO adorable! It's just unfortunate that he has absolutely no reciprocal interest in me. <strong><em>[[hits former self repeatedly. omg.]]</em></strong> Travis Earl is a different matter, and it isn't entirely my fault - I swear, he's been <em>trying</em> to seduce me. He does it to everyone. Thing is, I <em>know</em> that, and I know that it's a display of power rather than interest, and yet I'm still falling for it. But it bugs me - he's SUCH an egotistical bastard. Honestly I've never seen anyone with such a massively inflated ego...he's <em>so</em> full of himself. <strong><em>[[ok, this? this is true. :p]]</em></strong> Plus, as I've already stated obliquely, he thinks he's God's gift to women. The song ""Oh Lord, It's Hard to be Humble"" was written about him. And yet...there's many things about him I find intriguing. First of all, in my opinion he's right - he is hot. He's got the broody, sensual thing right down, plus he's built. Like, you can see his chest and arm muscles. And he's not so muscular that it's gross. Just enough that you notice. With his shirt off, he's really sexy.<br />The other thing I find compelling about him is his intellect. He's very bright (and, unfortunately, he knows it.) He sucks at math, but in English-type courses he's really good. But that's not the amazing part. The amazing part is - he <em>tries</em>. He actually does his work to the best of his abilities. He cares about grades. Even in courses he's bad at, like Math, he tries his best. That's such a refreshing change frommost of hte other guys. He also thinks about things, and generally has interesting and informed, if cynical, opinions. Despite this, however, he can be an infuriating person to discuss things with, since he always has to be right and tends to dismiss other people's opinions out of hand if they don't coincide with his.<br /><br />So anyways, I dunno. He's sexy and smart and interesting, but he's just so so so full of himself I just want to slap him. And he eats apple cores. (An interesting, though useless, piece of trivia.) Compared to Travis, Jon is the soul of modesty and politeness. Why don't I pick <em>nice </em>people to have crushes on?! Grrr...<br />It's a NID tomorrow. Me, Jay, and the Camerons are having a rhythm sectional at 10 am, so I'd better get some sleep.<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :) Stupidly twitterpated smudges.<br /></div>

<div><em>Fuck, I wish they'd just get it over with and start going out. </em>Cayley and Kurt, I mean. She says she doesn't ""like"" him anymore, but...whatever. The only person she's fooling is herself. And maybe him - he's prety gullible. He also doesn't think he has a crush on her, but that's bullshit too.<br />Was with them and Eric at Cayley's dad's house watching ""The Mummy Returns"" this evening. It was a really stupid movie, as we expected. It was kind of nice having a small group, though, plus we had an even guy-girl ratio, so everyone got to cuddle. (*Aww*).<br /><br />Tomorrow there is a definitely not small gathering happening at Brody's house (in Old Remo) in the evening. It's a drinking thing. We - meaning the girls; guy s are always invited to everything - are invited, too, for once. I'm considering going, but I don't want to drink. (I don't think I'm permitted, anyway - Jon and Wickie made a list of everyone who wanted alochol, and they all have to chip in twenty bucks. I didn't sign.) However, I might go and be a DD - it's fun to laugh at drunk people, especially if there are others not drinking with you. (That would be Cayley and Katy.) If I do go, I'm sure I'll have an interesting journal entry for you tomorrow!<br /><br />Our Rhythm Sectional kicked ass. It was so fun just playing with those guys. Then Dillon Gordon came and sang Zoot Suit Riot. He's a strange child.&nbsp;<br /><br />Lowell's <em>twelve</em>. I can't believe. That's almost a teenager. I remember being twelve; I felt so grown-up - <em>much</em> more gronw-up than it seems like Lowel should be! <em>And the seasons, they go round and round, and the painted ponies go up and down...<br /></em>Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>
<br />Saturday, May 4<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So, more than half of the alcohol was stolen from Jon's house...""><em>So, more than half of the alcohol was stolen from Jon's house...</em>by some of Chris's friends, because Jon cleverly told Josh Foot where they'd hidden it. Brad couldn't go, Cameron couldn't go, Kurt couldn't go, and Jon probably couldn't get a ride. Eric phoned me sevenish and suggested that we just rent some movies to watch at his old house instead, since it would probably be more fun. So we did - me, Eric, Cayley, Tyra, and Jessica McCooey. We watched <em>Fright Night</em>, which was really stupid but kind of funny, just like I remembered. I can't believe Nana let me watch it when I was ten though; there was lots of nudity and racy sex scenes. And I can't believe it didn't scare me! We also watched <em>It </em>again, so Eric could confront his childhood fear. He's not scared of it anymore. Still, I can see how the notion of Tim Curry as an evil clown who comes out of drains to kill children could be scary if you were six. Now, however, it's pretty stupid.<br /><br />I like Eric. I really do. When he's being nice, he's really nice. And he's almost always nice to me. He's good to cuddle with during scary movies, too. People seem to expect us to go out, and think that there's really more going on between us, but there isn't. I can't see going out with Eric; I mean...he's Eric! I can see us being, um...""friends with benefits"", however. I can certainly see winding up making out with him accidentally. But I don't think I could ever have a crush on him - he's not really my type. And vice-versa, I think, too. Nevertheless, he's a great friend.<br /><br />Had a wierd experience this evening, as well, in a totally unrelated tangent. Between movies, I drove the girls down to Mohawk to get chocolate (cause they weren't hyper enough before of course.) When we pulled in, there was this other car full of teenage guys we didn't recognize. They were from Smithers, looking for parties. (Cause there are so many parties in Terrace!) They asked us if we knew where any parties were. We didn't, except the one in Old Remo, which we didn't tell them about. Then they asked if <em>we</em> wanted to do something with them. I honestly think Tyra and Jessica would have gone with them, except that we'd left Eric back at the house. So eventually they left. It was weird, though. I could feel them checking us out, and that is totally not something I'm used [to]. All the guy shere sort of take us forgranted. But I could see these guys looking at me. Maybe that should creep me out or make me angry or something, but actually I found it flattering. Maybe that's sad - I don't know, and frankly, I don't much care. It felt good to be seriously paid attention to, for once.&nbsp;<br />Anyway. A fun night. Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Band trip! Yay!""><em>Band trip! Yay! </em>Actually I'm not that excited. It is fun, though. We're in Prince George right now, on the way to Calgary. We did two concerts today at elementary schools in Frasier Lake [and] Smithers, both of which (the concerts, I mean) sucked. Learning to play timpani for concert band is <em>HARD</em>. I've had to step in cause Will, the regular timpanist, didn't come on the trip. I think it would be fine if either a) I already knew how to play timpani, or b) I got to learn the songs from the beginning with everyone else. Not both, just either/or. but no. I'm sight-reading pieces that everyone else already knows on an instrument I've never played before. Timpani itself may be easy, but this is difficult.<br />I'm also worried about Jazz Band - recently, our Musicfest songs have all really sucked, and I don't know why. David thinks it's just apathy, which is entirely possible. I dunno.<br /><br />This hotel is cool It's called Esther's Inn, and it's designed to be tropical. Reminds me of Uncle Billy's in Hawaii. It's got this really funky courtyard in the middle withpools and hot-tubs and waterslides. I spent way too much time in 20+ degree water.<br />People want to sleep, so I'll continue this tomorrow on the bus...<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>
<br />Wednesday, May 15<br />This pen is invisible, but&nbsp; oh well. It's after midnight - I meant to write earlier, on the bus, but then I didn't. Again, oh well. The constant refrain.<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So yeah, last night in the pools was kind of cool.""><em>So yeah, last night in the pools was kind of cool. </em>(This is what I meant to write about yesterday). The stupid part was the chicken fights in the large pool, which I participated in for about 30 secs. The fun part was sitting in the hot-tub with David laughing at the people who were chicken-fighting. What we were really doing was gossiping, but we called it an intellectual discussion. It sounds much more sophisticated to be discussing the ""social behaviour of human animals during the mating season"" then ""who's gonna wind up with whom"", which is what it actually was.<br />Really, I think it's terribly brave - and foolhardy - of music teachers to take teenagers on tour...especially in the spring I mean, all the guys and a fair number of the girls are horny all year round anyway - in the spring, among the pheremones, we are all lost causes. This becomes increasingly apparent when you place 50 of us in an enclosed space (read: bus) for 10 hours straight. Honestly, it's sad. They're taking their lives into their own hands, travelling with us.<br /><br />--Wow. Just had a fire alarm. WE all piled downstairs and then back up again. Really stupid. The fire alarm here is really lame - it's not alarming at all. It's quiet, and sounds most akin to someone hitting a triangle at three-second intervals. If I'd been asleep, it probably wouldn't have woken me up - and Spiff meowing outside my window wakes me up! Anyway. The funny part was that practically none of the band people were even in their pyjamas. Clearly, no one was considering the possibility of going to bed.--<br /><br />Today was extremely uneventful. We had a ""Truth"" thing tonight, we basically means telling who you like (or, in my case, telling who you can't quite bring yourself to like because they're assholes.) Cayley likes Kurt (duhh), Eric likes Hayley Sullivan (not a surprise), Tyra likes Torrence (I finally know who he is, and he IS cute!) and Lance, and Katie <strong><em>[[sorry, Katy]]</em></strong> likes David (who she doesn't want to like) and Chris Chapman, who she does want to like. I, obviously, don't like Jon Rife and Travis Earl. Cameron (Adam) thinks Jon and I should go out. He keeps bugging us about it. Mostly cause we're short and violent, I think. Oh well. It's not gonna happen - he doesn't like or have any interest in me.<br /><br />It's true, the spring thing. every guy on this fucking trip is hot, or at least most of them.<br />Close quarters, cute guys, and raging hormones - don't you just love band trips? Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Got first in my class!""><em>Got first in my class! </em>I think I played it about the best I ever have. I'm worried about Jamie, though...she didn't show up for her class this afternoon. Jamie <em>never</em> bails! Her grandfather had a heart attack about a week ago - I hope he isn't dead.<br />Lowell got first in his class, too...out of twelve kids! We're very proud of him. It was his Beach Buggy Boogie, which is a really neat piece.<br /><br />On an (entirely) different note...<br />So, yesterday in the cafeteria at lunch time, I was hitting Jon (a common occurrence), because he stole my cookie. We're an extremely juvenile lot. Cam Adam was there and accused us of flirting. I suppose, in a way, we were, although I know its useless cause Jon has no interest. Oh well. He asked when we were gonna give it up and just go out.<br />Funny how five years changes the response to a silly question, asked in jest. In Grade 6, the reply would be along the lines of ""Ew, sick, I hate him/her!"" Now that we're ""grown-up"" Grade 11s, however, the question got fielded somewhat differently.<br />Jon glanced at me slyly. ""Oh,"" he replied to Cameron, ""I don't think we'll wind up going out. We'll just fuck each other."" Wink.<br />Excuse me? Did I miss something? Where did that come from? This from Jon Rife, who has made it quite clear that, of all my attributes, the one he most definitely is not interested in is my body. <strong><em>[[!!!!!!!!]]<br /></em></strong>They spent the rest of the lunch period essentially talking about me, and about screwing me...right in front of me. I oscillated between insulted and, perversely and against my better judgement, flattered. It's silly, since I know that really, Jon has no interest in me. Cam, I think, would sleep with anything that would sleep with him. Not seriously, of course - I'm almost positive he's a virgin, and he's actually a really sweet guy, as guys go - but that's the image he portrays. He's interested in any and every girl - including me. He told Jon that I'd already offered to help him reproduce. Which is true - I did do that, in a joking way of course, one time when he was talkign about needing to, umm, ""spread the seed of his genius.""<br />Boys are such strange creatures. And why do I feel so flattered?<br /><br />Darren's playing his Polly Wolly Doodle tomorrow, Lowell's doing ""Jest"" (Bartok), and I've got my Beethoven. Wish us luck!<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /><br /></div>

I did way better than I was expectin gto...I won the awards for all of my classes! And I played in Scholarships, which were tonight. <em>And</em> I'm playing (a solo) in Gala tomorrow! ...I have to brag about this here because I won't let myself do it anywhere else, cause I don't want people to <em>think </em>I'm bragging.<br />The only award I'm really proud of is the Beethoven. I had some stiff competition for that one - including Marlee Emery! The others (especially the Sibelius) were kind of by default. Also, being in Scholarships was nothing to be especially proud of - I'm really the only option in the Senior category. I am, I feel, justifiably proud to be playing in Gala. For me, that is an achievement.<br />The weirdest (and best) thing that happened this year was that I <em>wasn't nervous.</em> Even at Scholarships, with the bright lights and the dark house. It's the strangest feeling to walk onto the stage and simply not be nervous. I was nervous beforehand, but when it&nbsp; came to the performances I was cool It was great! (Hope it happens tomorrow too!)<br /><br />I've never, I don't htink, had a more stressful week than this. Maybe as stressful, but nothing surpassing this one.

Wait, that's not true. Provincials is more stressful. I didn't get recommended this year, and I'm glad. It would have been just one more thing...<br />I won $425 thought! <em>That's</em> cool. Three awards plus the Scholarship Consolation Prize (AKA Excellence Award). I think that's the most I've won in a year before. (Brag, brag, brag. Just tune me out. I have to say this stuff somewhere, and my conscience nags me less if I only inconvenience and bore a book.)<br />My performance tonight (the Romance by Sibelius) was not flawless, but it was pretty good. Everyone seemed to like it. It's such a crashy piece, you hardly notice wrong notes anyway.<br />There were some really cute performances - mostly Dance stuff. This one little girl...I forget her name at the moment...something oriental...did the most amazing Music Theatre piece. She won the junior Scholarhip this year, and she's this tiny 8-year-old from Prince Rupert. But her voice is huge! I don't know where she fits the lungs she must have in order to project like that. She did ""Whistle a Happy Tune"" from <em>The King and I</em>...at first I thought it must be miked, but no, those sounds were coming from the stage. Amazing! There was also a really cute dance by E-motion (the PR Dance company that Hans Seidemann is in) called Beetlemania.<br />Did I tell you I met Hans Seidemann's Source of Excellence last night? It's a small, well-loved stuffed cow called Moo-moo. (Imaginative name). It's his good luck charm. We've got one, too. Actually, we have a couple: Otto the otter and Mewgenspiegel (don't ask) the lion. Magic and superstition really do help, honest. But god, I'm <em>so</em> glad it's finally over!<br />Many relieved smudges, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

Some bad things happening regionally, though - more Campbell cuts. Ninth Block courses for next year have all been cut - that means no Jazz Band, Choir, or Production. Also, because of new higher minimum class-size requirements, the entire Band program in Caledonia may disappear, and Mr Parr would lose his job. This is very bad. Everyone's terribly upset and talking about writing letters and all such. Yeah right, like a ""strongly-worded letter"" will do a fuck's bit of good. Jon wants to go camp on Gordon Campbell's lawn and sing campfire songs loudly and offkey to the accompaniment of a poorly-played guitar.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tyra's birthday tonight. Parts of it were fun. Being around Jon can be demoralizing, though. He's such a prick He was talking, as we left, about the party he's going to tomorrow, which will be better because there'll be booze and ""cute girls"". Well, thanks, Jon. Way to raise a person's self esteem. Even if it's true - and I'm sure it is - that he finds none of us attractive, he has no need to say it so obviously or often. However, to give him credit, he was mostly really nice tonight - for him. He let me lean on him and that sort of thing. Almost like he was interested... but he isn't. *Sigh* Oh well.<br /><br />Foolishly smitten smudges (ooh, alliteration!) Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>"

April Fools! </em>I didn't realize that until I looked at the calendar this evening. (It was afternoon when I wrote the last bit; now it's quarter to eleven.) Thought I should distinguish between the entries somehow, so now I'm writing backwards. (Actually, that's just an excuse - I love doing this.)<br /><br />The queen mum (of Britain, naturally) died this weekend. Everyone's upset, and I know it's mean, but I can't bring myself to feel more than a nominal sadness. She didn't mean much to me personally, even as a figurehead. And she was more than one hundred years old, for Pete's sake! (Btw, why is it <em>Pete's </em>sake? Who's Pete? I've always wondered. I suppose it's just another way of catching yourself when you were about to take the Lord's name in vain, or whatever. Like ""for goodness' sake,"" or ""Geez"", or whatever. But why Pete, of all things? Oh well, I don't suppose it really matters much.)&nbsp;<br />Finished the fifth and final book in the <u>Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</u> today, ""Mostly Harmless."" For a silly book, it ended pretty tragically. Everyone dies. (Not that you hadn't been expecting every minute for them to die for the last 1000 pages anyway, but still.) I didn't like it. I think he should have written at least one more before he died - now it's too late. Maybe he just finally got tired of it and decided to get it over with and kill them off. Or maybe he always intended to write a sixth one, and hadn't counted on the whole dying thing to happen first. Who knows?&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm afraid I'm in danger of having an honest-to-goodness crush on Jon, despite the fact that he's an arrogant self-centered prick. It's that time of year, and he seems the only likely candidate at the moment. Oh well. All my previous crushes have been hopeless, so I guess this one might as well be too. Crushes are always fun, even when they're pathetic. And at least I <em>know</em> Jon! Then again, maybe it won't happen at all.

The one guy, oddly enough reminded me a lot of Will Shack - he's in the band at school. It wasn't Will, but he looked kinda like him and acted and sounded kinda like him. That's okay - I like Will. He reminds me of a teddy bear. A really big teddy bear. He's nice.<br /><br />I really wish Jon wasn't such an insensitive asshole - it would be a lot easier to cultivate a crush on him then. And it bugs me even more because I see the potential for a really nice guy buried under all that self-centeredness and teenage belligerence and insecurity. Oh well.

Guys were playing D&amp;D (I always have trouble with the ""&amp;""s), so there were like no guys there. Aaron was, but he's never held any interest for me. Besides which, he's going out with Manda. Go figure. I think it's a good thing for her to have someone she can focus her attentions on. She's <em>so</em> touchy! Things seem to be happening so fast. I think Cayley and Kurt will be going out before too long. She thinks not, and says she no longer has a crush on him, but I don't know. I think it's a definite possibility. And they'd make <em>such </em>a good couple. ...Whatever a ""couple"" is. Funny how I have no problem seeing other people in relationships, but when it comes to myself I'm completely at a loss as to how that would work... Sigh.<br />Not sure how much I approve of Aaron, though. He makes me annoyed and uncomfortable - I get ""bad vibes"" from him, as it were. With all of our other guys, I can put up with them being insensitive immature assholes because under the surface I see really nice, caring guys, and I think once they're done being teenagers they'll be really sweet. They certainly have that potential. Aaron, on the other hand, seems very nice superficially, but below that are...shady undercurrents of racism, sexism, and general right-wing biased gun-toting assholeness. I don't like it. But who am I to intrude. Whatever floats your boat...<br /><br />Finally met this Eric guy Jessica Coe is always talking about. He seem snice enough, but looks way older than eighteen! And he's got facial hair. Ick. I hate facial hair, especially on teenage guys. It just looks so silly and pretentious on adolescents.<br />...Fuck, I swear one of these days I'm just gonna jump on Jon. I want him so bad! It's ridiculous. He's so sexy...but I'm like the only person who thinks so. Even when he's arrogant and condescending (which is always) I still have to restrain myself from accosting him physically. Isn't that sad?&nbsp;<br />I don't know where that came from. Just ignore it; I'm hormonal. (Yeah, no shit!)<br /><br />People (meaning mostly Cayley and Jessica) have been involved in this online ""LiveJournal"". I thought it was sort of a stupid idea - I mean, I've got this journal, on paper; why would I want to write on the Internet? But the thing is, it's open to others to view. So, I'm thinking of doing it, just as a way of communicating thoughts to people which are too difficult to express verbally. I could certainly never write half the stuff I write in here into a public, online journal <strong><em>[[Ok, now...is this ironic? ...Or is this ironic?]]</em></strong>, there are some things you want your friends to know, without outright <em>telling</em> them. Kind of a neat idea...<br />Smudges. :)<br /></div>

Music Festival started last week, but piano's second week this year, so my first solo - an Impressionist Prelude by Delius - is tmorrow. I'm nervous because it's the sort of song that can very easily go terribly awry. It's incredibly short, with the result that if you start off on the wrong foot, you've no time to get back to the right one before the piece is over. When it's great it's great, though. So we'll see. I've no chance (or very very very little) of winning that award (I'm against Jamie), and scarcely any of winning for my Beethoven, which is Wednesday (there're tons of kids up for that prize.) However, I do have a chance at winning the award for Romantics Other Than German, which is my Romance, by Sibelius. I do hope I win at least that one award, but if I don't, well...oh well.

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I'd write backwards, except...""><em>I'd write backwards, except...</em>a) that would probably confuse you, and b) it's 2:30 am and I want to write quickly. Despite reason a), however, I'll likely try that tomorrow - it's really quite liberating. I started experimenting with it earlier this week, and it just makes so much sense! Left-handed people should all write backwards, it would solve so many of our problems. Everyone could just carry around mirrors if they couldn't read the backwards writing. Really, it's a good solution. Anyway.<br /><br />We watched two movies tonight, <em>Good Will Hunting </em>and <em>Blow</em>. The first was funny, if bittersweet, and ended well; the second was long and depressing and ended poorly. They were both good movies, but we should have watched them in the reverse order...it would have left me with a greater peace of mind.<br /><br />It's definitely approaching springtime.Even if it doesn't look like spring outside, spending an hour - or less! - inside a high school will tell you the season. Everyone's hormones are currently in over-drive - they <em>really </em>want to get laid. They're - we're - twitterpated, as it were. People would probably look askance if I said that I want to fuck virtually every teenage guy I lay eyes on, but in a sense it's true. As far as my body's concerned, there's no time like the present for getting rid of that useless virginity. Actually, I even made what I consider a sort of a breakthrough today in choir - I was attracted to Chris Hartman! I never have been before - I mean, he's a&nbsp; nice guy and everything, but I'd never considered him particularly physically attractive. I tend to like delicate or ""cut"" guys, and Chris is fairly solid. But today, I could have touched him all over. Cameron Kelso, too. And Jon Rife, but that's nothing new.<br /><br />Fuck, it must be spring!<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""[BACKWARDS] Spreaking of spring, it snowed like all day today.""><em>[BACKWARDS] Spreaking of spring, it snowed like all day today. </em>It was ridiculous! It is Easter weekend - how can we hunt for eggs in the snow? Stupid weather. It is, technically, spring now, and I think it's time this year started acting it's age. No more of this juvenile snow-in-April (or, well, <em>practically </em>April) stuff. I know that in some parts of the world that would be normal, but this isn't one of them.<br /><br />So how are you handling the backwards writing? Maybe for posterity's sake I should write forwards, but this is so much fun! Do me a favour and keep struggling through it for a few more minutes. I know it's messy, but I am fairly new to the concept. Twelve years of ingrained habits are hard to break free of, and I still occasionally put letters in the wrong way round. I also have a tendancy to write some words (especially ""to"") frontwards.<br />Unfortunately, it's a lot easier to get used to writing this way than it is to get used to reading someone's writing that's written this way. Also, when I write this way in a book, the pages are backwards. If you're using this system then pages, as well as letters and words, should read right to left. Plus margins are on the wrong side of the page.&nbsp;<br /><br />Gawd, I wish I had a crush. It's crush season, despite what the weather says. I wish Jon weren't such a prick - if he was a nice guy as well as sexy and funny and smart, he'd be perfect crush material. One of these days, when he's finished being a teenager and an asshole, he'll be a real charmer. Cayley disagrees, but that's just cause she's too tall. And he's <em>such</em> a good dancer. *Sigh*. Again, shame about the Insensitive Asshole attitude.<br />I wish any number of things. I wish Travis wasn't Travis. I wish he was less sulky, less volatile, and had at least some interests that bore a vague resemblance to one or two of mine. I also wish he was shorter and...meatier...but that's really neither here nor there. Basically, I just wish we were more compatible - it sucks that the only confirmed person to ever have a crush on me is completely <em>not</em> the sort of person I would choose to go out with. Ironic, I suppose. Or maybe I'm just too picky.<br /><br />On a completely different note, we made pysanky (Ukranian Easter Eggs) today. We suck at it and the best eggs always break, but it's really fun!! Mum and Lowell and I each did four - Lowell's sort of a minimalist when it comes to art...his eggs consist mainly of a few dots and lots of dye. Mum's and mine are a bit more creative, but both of our favourite eggs broke. So sad! :(<br />Found Lemmings on the upstairs computer! I love that game...but it's addictive. I just hope I don't have little lemmings marching around in my head all night. The disclaimer onthe box is valid: it reads<br />""Not responsible for - Loss of hair; Loss of mind; Loss of sleep.""<br />Goodnight, Kitty! Many backwards (aka left-handed) smudges. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Being a teenager is difficult shit.""><em>Being a teenager is difficult shit. </em>No, really. I mean, you're already going through all these physical changes and hormonal wierdnesses, and instead of backing off and giving you some time and space to figure things out, they hand you a list of rules and heap piles of Things to Learn, Things to Do, and Rights &amp; Responsibilities on you, and tell you to go for it.<br />Well, thanks.<br />Sigh. It's that time of year. It's that time of month, it's that time of week, it's that time of day. I'm that sort of person, I'm that sort of age. And I'm probably making no sense to anyone, especially me. Everyone thinks I'm so fucking mature, responsible, and smart. I'm not any of those things - I'm just better than others at hiding my confusion.<br /><br />Gemmells plus John minus Paul and the twins were here for Easter. That was fun, as usual. We wrote our own clues for each other. Yesterday evening Martina and I went out with people and threw snow at each other at the college. Yes, snow. At Easter. It snowed all day Saturday, and it would have been lovely were it December or January. But it's fucking March! Almost April. Ridiculous. At least it was packing snow - we built a snow snail and a sort of mutant bunny with wings and an antler. It was fun.<br />There was weirdness at one point. I forget what led up to it, but Jon (Rife) asked me ""What do you want from me?"" I replied flippantly, as always, ""Oh, you know what I want, Jon!"" (sexual implication, of course.) But his response confused me - he said, ""No, I don't. Come on...you've been jerking me around for a year - <em>what do you want?</em>""<br />Was he serious? I couldn't tell. I didn't know what to say. Really of course, I do ""want"" him. I think he's beautiful and sexy, if a prick. That's why I'm always flippant - if I wasn't, I might have to say something real. Anyway, the moment passed, and it was alright again. But I can't help wondering what he meant...I know the exchange sounds illy on paper, but it was weird and not like Jon. I guess you had to be there.<br /><br />I had a dream about him last night. Well, not about <em>him</em>, per se, but he was in it. It was one of those rare sex-y dreams that I prize so highly. We were married, and Katy Kennedy was our kid, only we weren't and she wasn't really, but for some reason we had to pretend. The upside was that I got to sleep with Jon. My dream didn't involve sex - they rarely do, and it's just as well since the actual act never feel slike anything, but it was very sexy. I love those kind of dreams, and they'e far too rare.<br /><br />I'm feeling bad about Travis. Fuck, that's nothing new&nbsp;- I <em>always</em> feel bad about Travis. Guilt about that whole situation is just sort of a constant thing for me. But more so, lately, and I'm not sure what to do about it.<br />See, Eric and I have been really touchy and cuddly lately, which is fun; I love it. Eric's nice because he can be touchy without it meaning anything. Neither of us is really interested in the other one and we both know it, so it can just be fun and meaningless. It's not like we're making out or anything - just being silly. Eric's a very easy person to do that with cause he's so comfortable with it, and he reciprocates. I'd do the same with any of our guys - it's just that Eric's the only one who seems remotely interested, and I hate forcing my affections on unwilling participants - it's no fun.<br />However, I think Travis is upset by it. He's seemed sulky lately, and I wondered briefly if that was why, but dismissed the idea. However, last night Cayley told me that is the reason he's been moody. I have a hard time grasping that. Hell, I have a hard [time] believing that he likes me in the first place, despite the fact he asked me out. And the notion that someone would be upset about me and <em>Eric</em> is ridiculous. Cayley asked if there was anything ""going on between us"", and I had a hard time not laughing. I mean, come on. It's Eric!<br />But what makes me mad is that it's making me feel guilty. I have no reason for guilt! It's not even like I'm excluding Travis - I'd be perfectly willing to be much more physical with him than I am. Heck, I've <em>tried</em> it, but he's just so stand-off-ish. I don't know if he thinks he's being noble or what, ubt it's fucking <em>annoying</em>! It's like he doesn't want to touch me himself, but he doesn't want anyone else touching me either. Fuck, I am NOT his property. And yet still I feel inexplicably guilty. Shit. I hate my conscience.<br /><br />I guess the right thing to do would be to talk to him and sort things out (again), but I'm just so bad at the initiating conversations - particularly ones that mean something. Gawd. I don't know what to do. I hate being a teenager.&nbsp;<br />Goodnight, Kitty. Thank you for listening and sorry for swearing so much.<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It's been a long time - like 2 weeks - since I've written...""><em>It's been a long time - like 2 weeks - since I've written</em>, but things haven't changed much. I still haven't told Travis anything, and I feel so guilty about that! I'm such a coward. And I'm still confused. I've been given lots of (conflicting) pieces of advice, but they don't seem to help. Cayley and Jessica say that if I have any doubts whatsoever then I shouldn't say yes, for fear of being hurt, whereas my mum says that if I have even the slightest interest in him, I should at least try it, just to see what it's like. Serious philosophic conflicts here, as you can see. Theoretically ,I'm more inclined towards my mum's approach - you never know if you never try. If I followed Cayley's advice I'd never do anything - I <em>always</em> have doubts about everything. But in practice it's harder. I need to talk to him, I know that, but I'm too cowardly to initiate that, and besides, I still don't know what I'm going to say. But I know I have to say something. Even a straight out No is kinder than this prolonged uncertainly: I don't want to repeat Eric's mistake with Manda.<br /><br />Speaking of Manda, I think she and Aaron might wind up together. We're all looking forward to this prospect. It's good for Manda, who needs someone to pay attention to her; it's good for Cayley cause it gets Aaron off her hands (he has a crush on her); and it's good for all the rest of us cause we won't have to put up with Manda's clingyness as much. Anyway, here's hoping.<br /><br />Last weekend, I'm not sure why I didn't write. On Friday we were in Kitimat (small group - Tyra, Jessica, me, Manda, Aaron - more were invited but couldn't/wouldn't come) and slept over at Tyra's grandparents' house in Cable Car. They have the coolest house ever! It reminded me so much of the cottage, cause it's heated by wood - and has a kitchen range just exactly like the one at the cottage. It made me nostalgic. The house was a bizarre mix of old and new - they had a huge TV and sound system beside a player piano (incredibly out of tune) and a genuine Victrola record player! Very cool. And the staircase was wooden and spirally and awesome. The whole place just screamed to be the set of a ""Stuck in the Cabin in a Snow Storm"" movie...we wished we had a video camera. Tyra's aunt also had a cool hot tub. (Oxymoron, I know...) I love hot tubs!<br />Then this Friday we were at Cayley's, and the girls slept over. It was fun...I was ovulating and Eric was very sexual. We (the whole group) are getting worse and worse, I swear! I think Mum's right - it is only a matter of time before we escalate to making out and sleeping with each other. We watched <em>The Shining</em> after the boys left, and I wished they were still there. Scary movies are much better when you have someone to cuddle...someone of the <em>opposite</em> sex! It was a really cool, creepy movie. Jack Nicholson is very good at playing a crazy man - he's so scar!<br />Tonight we watched <em>Transformers: The Movie</em> at Eric's old house. Don't ask me why. That is quite possibly THE stupidest movie I have seen...ever. Cayley and I laughed all the way through. Eric and Kurt kept shushing us... ""Shut up! it's good! You guys just don't know what you're talking about!""<br /><br />Other weirdness. Jay asked me out on Tuesday. I'm (almost) positive he was joking - and I really hope he was, cause otherwise I was really mean. But he must have been joking. Right? Otherwise would be too weird.<br />Bottle drive tomorrow...what joy...<br />Coldest weather we've had all winter, and it's <em>March</em>!. Fuck.<br />Goodnight Kitty. :) (I don't mean that, I'm just goofin' around, that's all!) :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Spring has sprung...or well, no, it hasn't.""><em>Spring has sprung...or well, no, it hasn't. </em>It should have. It's Spring Break!<br />I know I've said this before, but it seems like every year just goes faster and faster. Spring Break means it's almost Festival...Festival means it's almost the band trip, which means it's almost&nbsp;the end of school. Then I'm in Grade 12, and then I'm graduating, and...Gawd, don't even <em>go </em>there. It's so terrifying. I don't want to have to take responsibility for my own life! I'm still a child...yet it looms nearer and nearer.<br /><br />At the same time, I'm glad it's March Break. A week off will be nice - although it still feels like it was just Christmas!<br />Saw Lennie Gallant tonight. Was a bit worried that it would be soulful and whiny and lame, but it wasn't. Actually, it was quite good. Jay's family knows him - actually, the band has been staying at Jay's house - and he got to go up and play with them during the encore! It was neat. We were sitting right in front of Jay, which meant we also had the misfortune of sitting right in front of Cody, Jay's mentally handicapped younger brother. He doesn't understand the meaning of ""quiet"".<br /><br />You know (changing topics entirely), it's been a year since I started hanging out with this group of people. It was the beginning of March last year when we started playing D&amp;D...and it was about a month later that that fell apart. But it was funwhile it lasted. And it's fun in a different (kinkier) way now. Actually, I was thinking about this, we do really weird stuff, considering some of our hangups. We suck each others toes, take off our shirts and massage each other, and play all sorts of other silly flirty games. Cayley and Jessica gave Kurt a hard-on. I've wrestled extensively with Eric and lain full-length along his back (actually very comfortable), and he's touched al of our asses and most of our breasts (not mine.) My borders of comfort are way way looser than they were a year ago - as Eric said, they really have corrupted me - it's just been so subtle, no one - including me - noticed. And yet...there are some fairly commonplace things which we've never done and in fact have sort of a taboo against. Kissing is the big one. None of us except Tyra has kissed anyone else in the group. Tyra's kissed (<em>french</em>-kissed, no less) Eric and Jon, but no one else have even normal kissed. It's odd. Why do we have hangups about that when we're willing to take off articles of clothing and stick various appendages in people's mouths? We're an odd bunch...<br /><br />Anyway. It's Spring Break! Yay! Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I've had ample time to write in the past few days, but haven't been in the right mood.""><em>I've had ample time to write in the past few days, but haven't been in the right mood. </em>Still, I think this needs updating.<br />I never told you what happened with the Travis situation, did I? Well, we went out for coffee at Groundworks on Monday (<em>last</em> Monday) to talk. It was awkward cause I didn't know what to say and he didn't know what to say, and I <em>still </em>hadn't made a decision. I said it baffled me that he - or anyone - would find me attractive. He said I ""sell myself too short."" Whatever <em>that</em> means. It was cute, anyway. Our conversation was mainly umms and ahs, and eventually it amounted to the fact that I didn't feel comfortable making a huge leap into a relationhip. I said I was afraid I'd hurt him, which is true. He's sensitive and more moody than a woman with PMS. When he's nice he's really sweet, but when he's sulky he'd be a bitch to have as a boyfriend (I didn't say that part.) So there's that. I said I was happy to take it one step at a time and see where it went naturally. For cowardly me, that's much more comfortable.<br /><br />Tonight when I was driving Cayley and Tyra and Travis home from Jessica's house (an uneventful and fairly boring evening), he observed that we could ""climb to the moon on a rope."" (!!) It was totally unexpected and a cool comment. I don't know where it came from, but I'd like to see more of the whimsical Travis. It <em>was</em> a cool moon - like the one in the Dreamworks logo.<br />Not really a lot to say. Going skiing tomorrow (downhill). Got stay-in contacts - it's so weird waking up with vision!<br />Sigh. The week will be gone before I know it - I just know it! (Did that make sense? No.) Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""So here's the background you need:""><em>So here's the background you need:</em> last Saturday (I didn't write, because it was almost 2 by the time I got to bed), I had people over here. Minus a few, as usual...Travis, 'cause he was still grounded, and Jon, who was at a Ventures (Scouts) camp. Eric Cook was there (cause he asked directly if he was invited, and I suck at saying no), as was Aaron, who seems to have become part of our group. I'm not totally comfortable with him yet, cause I really don't know anything about him. But in time...<br /><br />Anyway. Fun in a boring way, as usual. Except for Eric. There were, I suppose, two incidents. The first was when Eric took his shirt off (subtly - he's always been inexplicably embarassed of his chest) and put on Jessica's snake leather jacket. I ...hid... his shirt in the closet, so he couldn't put it back on, but he saw me.<br />And the war began. Play-fighting is really fun, especially when you're pretty evenly matched...which we are. Eric's taller than me, but we weigh about the same, and I'm stronger than him. It was invigorating. At one point, I wound up riding him (in the non-sexual sense - you know how teenage minds work!) like a horse or something. Then I fell, and he sort of fell on top of me, and in the process my arm got dragged sharply against the floor. I was left with a battle wound - a rug burn. It must have been fairly severe, cause I still have it, and the inner part's still just barely closed. (He finally got his shirt back, btw. I gave up.)<br />So then, later, we were on the bed - well, a lot of people were - and Eric, Tyra, and Jessica were playing How Far Can You Stick Your Tongue Down Someone's Throat. ...No, I'm serious. They were essentially french-kissing...without the kissing. It was weird, and unprecedented within our group. Somehow it didn't surprise me that Eric and Tyra would initiate it, however.<br />Anyway, eventually Eric realized what he'd been doing, and he became embarassed. He started hiding his face with his hands, and I tried to stop him. This escalated into a second war, except this one, oddly enough, involved tongues. Not tongues together, but tongues - and mouths - on various other body parts - mainly appendages. It culminated in Eric sucking my toes, and eventually, to the amazement of all present, sticking practically my whole foot in his mouth. Eric's very slobbery, and it was a strange and wet - although not necessarily unenjoyable&nbsp;- experience.<br /><br />So there's that.<br />Tonight we were at Lindsay's. Travis was there, which was a surprise since technically, he's still grounded. (A dance is considered a ""school event"", which was why he was allowed to go last night. Today, he tricked his parents with an unbeatable wager and was allowed to come.) That was nice. I like having Travis there. I wound up leaning on him, similar to how Jon and I were at the Murder Mystery thing, except with the roles reversed. (ie I was lying on him.) Later I cuddled (for lack of a better word) in a similar manner with Eric. And somehow or other, my feet wound up in his mouth again. Most odd. When we were playing Truth or Dare, I had, at one point, one foot in Eric's mouth and the other in Travis's. It was weird. And disturbingly kinky, in retrospect. But fun, at the same time. I must say, too, that I was not always on the <em>receiving</em> end of the sucking. I also, at various points, had both Eric and Travis's fingers in my mouth. (But <em>not</em> feet. That's going too far, as far as I'm concerned.)<br /><br />I wished Jon was there. He's always good for a bit of friendly violence now and then. I think he didn't come cause ""Lindsay's a bitch."" Even if that were true, though, I don't see why it matters. I mean, it's just a venue, for Heaven's sake. What you do, and who you talk to while you're there, is your own business!<br />G'night Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Forgot to mention that Wednesday was a special day, historically.

A triple palindrome! Very cool. And the last one was over 1000 years ago, in one thousand one. Bet you no-one noticed!<br /><br />Interesting evening. Had a small group of people over - five in total, but that's small compared to normal. It was short notice, so lots of people weren't available. Eric was ""doing something"" (read: drinking) with Cam Adam and some people, Travis is (forever) ground, Aaron had plans, and Manda was busy being drepressed.&nbsp; I know it's selfish, but honestly I'm just as glad she didn't come - she would have pulled it down, and we would have spent the entire evening trying (ineffectually) to cheer her up - we spend&nbsp;quite a bit of&nbsp;time doing that with Jessica as it is.&nbsp;*<br /><br />So. Tonight it was me, Tyra, Cayley, Jessica, Kurt, and Jon. Jon wasn't going to come, but the rave he was going to go to was cancelled.&nbsp;<br />This configuration meant, it turns out, two girls to a guy. Jessica and Cayley took Kurt, so Tyra and I had Jon. Well, not exactly had...but the attempt was invigorating. It was actually nice having fewer people for a change. Sort of intimate. I cuddled some with Jon, Tyra cuddled some with Jon, and Cayley and Jessica <em>really</em> cuddled with Kurt. In fact, they gave him a hard-on. Poor dear. Cayley didn't notice, and no on epointed it out until he'd gone. It was sort of amazing, actually!<br /><br />I don't think we succeeded in doing the same with Jon. We tried- well, Tyra tried. I just cuddled. After Cayley and Kurt left, Jon was all alone with the three of us. He didn't need to fear from me, of course; I'm fairly reserved. Don't get me wrong, if Jon started kissing me I'd kiss him back and make out with him with very little hesitation. I'm very attracted to him. However, I don't believe in pushing people's limits or putting them in situations where they be comfortable. Essentially, no unwanted touching.<br />Tyra and Jessica have no such restraints.They totally molested him. I couldn't tell whether he was secretly enjoying it or whether he was honestly uncomfortable. He said he found it awkward, and although subjectively that doesn't make sense to me - I mean, it's just <em>us</em> and he knows nothing's really goingg to happen - still, objectively, I can understand his viewpoint. I would feel awkward if, say, Eric, Jon, and Travis were all over me at once, too. But mostly, I'd be confused.<br /><br />Mum asked me today if there was any inclination within our group towards pairing up. I said no, and that's true. However, it's <em>only</em> true because our guys aren't remotely interested in us, that way. If they were half as interested in us as we are in them, I guarantee we'd be paired off in an instant.<br />Still, they insist on desiring unattainable girls...<br />Sigh. Gnight Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""I feel like crying.""><em>I feel like crying. </em>Or something. I thought maybe we'd managed to avoid this bridge. I thought maybe it was just spring run-off, and that, with a little time and patience, we'd be able to walk across the dry creekbed and blissfully forget that the dreaded metaphorical bridge was ever there to begin with. Apparently not.<br /><br />I suppose its at least partly my fault (actually, if you look at it one way, it's entirely my fault). I mean, I <em>did</em> encourage him, in that perverse, suicidal way of mine. Why did I do that? I don't know...although really, I suppose I do. I mean, I like flirting. I like cuddling. I like attention. Don't most people? So I guess I have only myself to blame for the dilemma facing me now.<br /><br />Do I need to spell it out for you, or can you (like most people) guess what's happened? Travis asked me out at lunchtime today.<br />Cayley thinks I should be flattered and, well, yeah, I am. But still, I <em>really</em> wish he hadn't forced the issue. I'd kind of hoped that he was over me by now, but I guess not. Why can't he be like me and just let crushes run their course without taking action?<br />So what do I say to that, exactly? I asked him to give me a while to think (which I've been doign madly ever since), and i suppose I'll have to write him a letter... I think better on paper - there's less uming and ahind and searching for the right words. But I can't put him off for ever - ignoring it won't make it go away.<br /><br />It's not that it''s Travis, exactly I mean, I <em>don't</em> like him, you know, ""that way"", but I like him as a person when he's being himself instead of an asshole. I like having him as a friend, and he's sometimes a nice person to talk to. And he's not bad-looking...as a matter of fact, he can look quite sexy - like a model. Sort of broody and sensual. It's not really the kind of looks I tend to go for; pretty to look at, but in terms of cuddleability (a word is born!), he's too skinny. People should have meat on their bones. Plus he's way too tall for me; it's almost comical. All the same, he's generally a fairly caring and sensitive person, and so I don't think it's <em>him </em>that's making me hesitate&nbsp;- I think I'd react the same way to practically anyone.<br />It's the concept that I have a hard time dealing with. Like, what does ""going out"" entail, exactly? How would that change the relationship we have now? I asked Travis that, and he didn't seem to understand it any better than I do. He wasn't really sure what he was asking. I need the ground rules figured out before I agree to play the game.<br /><br />I wish he'd asked something specific. If he asked me to go somewhere with him or do something with him, I'd say yes. And then we could take it from there. I'm definitely in favour of small steps - 0 to 160 in 0.6 seconds is not my idea of a good time.<br />It's something I've never really thought about honestly before - I guess I always figured that whoever Iwound up going out with would have previous experience on which to base a relationship, and anyway, it was never a thing that it wsa necessary to worry about, so to speak. It was never imminent.<br /><br />Bother. I never considered the repercussions. We bitch a lot about never having been in a relationship, but now that its been brought to a head, it turns out that there are things I really like about being single. I love flirting with the guy sin our group - all of them, not just Travis. Fuck it, I like Eric sucking on my toes, even if it grosses everyone else out. I like slow dancing with Jon, and playing with his fingers. If I am someone's girlfriend, does that mean that my body essentially ""belongs"" to him? I guess that's the idea behind fidelity, isn't it? <em>Of course</em> I think people should be faithful...I'd just never really thought about it in terms of real life before. I suppose if you like - I mean, ""like"" - the person that it's a moot point anyway, cause they're the only one you want to touch. But...<br /><br />I'm so confused. I really really wish he hadn't asked me - cowardly though it may be, I hate confronting problems. I guess I could sum up my bafflement in one word: Why? Why did he have to pick then and there to ask me out? A crowded cafeteria is a stupid place to carry on an important conversation. Why should we go out? What earthly purpose would it serve? How will it change anything? And the big one, which I really can't comprehend, is <em>Why does he like me?&nbsp;</em>Guys don't like <em>me</em>! They just don't. What's the attraction? I'm not pretty, and I've got virtually nothing in common with him. I don't get it.<br /><br />I don't get a lot of things.<br /><br />Funny how everyone seems to know. Stupid grapevines. All the group people saw us talking together and sort of figured it out - they'd been expecting it, I guess. Actually, <em>everyone</em> kind of figured it out. Seems the fact that Travis likes me is pretty much common knowledge. I'm thankful that <em>I</em> knew he liked me beforehand. That would have been too much of a shock, coming all at once! At least I got it in a couple of rounds, with some months in between to get used to the first before the second was dumped on me.<br /><br />God. I don't want to deal with this issue. I really don't. Why can't he just take it back? Why can't it just be how it was?<br />Pretty fucking confused smudges.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text="""" with="""" out="""" going="""" you="""" are=""""><em>""So, are you going out with Travis, yet?"" </em>asked Hali this afternoon in choir. Three things came into my head. The first was ""No,"" which I told her. The second was ""<em>Yet?</em>"", which I didn't say. The third thing was yet more amazement at the gossip ability of teenagers. How is it that everyone and their dog seems to know about this? People who I didn't even think <em>knew</em> Travs know about it. And all this publicity just makes it worse.<br /><br />So what the fuck should I do? I wrote him a letter last night and gave it to him today: it says essentially that we need to talk, but not at school or on the phone (I hate phones). That means, of course, that this whole thing needs to be put off until he's done being grounded (whenever that is.) However, with <em>everyone</em> knowing he asked me out and wanting to know what's happening next, I doubt that that will happen. ...I hate being an object of gossip - I never have been before, and the idea that people talk about me when I'm not around makes me nervous.<br /><br />School's been awkward and surreal. Classes are fine, although I'm having difficulty concentrating on homework. But Break and Lunch are pretty strained. I sort of lived in a little box, studioiusly ignoring the table where Travis (and lots of people) were sitting. I know its silly to avoid each other, but I can't help it. Everything's changed, and it's just so awkward.&nbsp;<br />That's the main reason that I wish he'd never asked me. I mean, I like the relationship we have <em>now.</em>&nbsp;I like being friends, and being able to talk, and being able to cuddle without it meaning anything. But now everything's weird, and I'm afraid that our friendship is going to change no matter what. If I don't go out with him, can we still be the way we used to be? I'm not sure if we can go back...<br /><br />...You'd think I'd have told my mother about all of this. Most people seem to tell their mothers stuff. I don't know why I find that so difficult. I know advice, either peer or parental, would do me good. But I just can't talk about stuff...I've never been good at that. That's what this book is for - expressing and getting rid of all the stuff that I can't voice out loud to anyone. Even here, I'm a bit inhibited about some things, but I'm way more candid and honest in this journal than anywhere else.<br /><br />And I still don't know what to do. I think my system's in shock. I've had difficulty concentrating and had a great urge to sleep for the last couple days. Yesterday I cam home, lay down, and went to sleep, unintentionally. I only meant to think for a while. I almost did the same thing today, accidentally. I <em>never </em>sleep in the afternoon. I'm never this tired. I should be studying for a Biology test I have tomorrow, but instead here I am, talking in circles to an inanimate object. I couldn't concentrate.<br />I'm so confused that's what it boils down to. What should I do? I don't even know what I <em>want</em>! Stometimes I'm not worried about it at all, and figure it'll all work itself out. Other tmes, I'm really stressed and feel like crying. Sometimes I want to say yes, and sometimes I want to run away screaming. Mostly, I just want it to never have happened. Unfortunately, that's the one option I don't have.<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Well. I had people (plus Lance minus Kurt and Travis) over this evening..."">...and we did that questionnaire thing, and I don't know whether I should be flattered or not, but <em>should </em>doesn't matter, cause I am. It turned out a lot better than I thought it would; I mean, it worked. Although, since there were only three guys, it wasn't hard to figure out which one belonged to whom. It was <em>supposed</em> to be anonymous, but, well, everything's more fun if you <em>know</em>.<br /><br />The first question was teh One Night Stand thing - essentially, if you could have a one night stand with anyone with no weird consequences or hard feelings, who would it be? No on epicked me. If Travis had been here, he...probably...would, but he wasn't. Eric and Jon both picked Manda, and Lance picked Cayley. The Manda thing kind of surprises me, but I guess that's mostly because she wouldn't be my pick if I were a guy. I'd pick Cayley. But I guess I can see where it comes from - she's very fit, and muscular, and she's got big breasts.<br /><br />The second question was a continuation of the first, and said simply, ""Barring that, who's your next choice?"" And Eric and Jon both picked me.<br />Which really surprised me when I thought about it. Especially for Eric - I would have put him down for Cayley, no question, as a secondary option. But they picked me. And they both picked me for being the best person to be stuck on a desert island with forever, which means they think I'm more interesting than Manda, at least.<br /><br />Maybe it's pathetic to be pleased at being the second pick - especially since I know neither of them are <em>really</em> interested in any of us at all, but I still feel flattered. Actually, Eric and Jon picked a lot of the same answers. It's kind of funny. And lots of people thought I'm the nicest girl in the group. And apparently Jon and I would have ""adorable offspring"". And the adjective most commonly used to describe me is ""cute"". So all in all it was a fairly positive experience. Did you know Jon masturbates daily and Eric once or twice a week? Hmm...<br /><br />But I wish Kurt and Travis had done - we'll have to get them to do it at school Monday. I want Travis's just for the morale boost (although he might surprise me, and then I'd be unhappy), but I'm really interested in Kurt's. He's so enigmatic, I have no idea what he's thinking. I would <em>bet</em> he picks Cayley first and Manda second and puts Cayley on the island, but I was wrong before. That's just judging from what I've witnessed of his interactions with people. I really have no clue.<br />Interesting times...<br /><br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Started 2nd semester today.""><em>Started 2nd semester today. </em>It's so odd having new classes - I feel like I should be writing ""Sept"" instead of ""Feb""! My classes are all alright, I think. I've got Math with Mr Cook, whom I don't know anything about, and Beth, Hannah Huston, and Jay are in that class with me. It should be fun, anyway. I like Math. Then I've got Physics. Ick. I'm afraid I've got rather a hang-up about Physics. I'm convinced I can't do it. Guess all you can do is try. The teacher, Mr Wootton, seems really cool. He cracks the <em>stupidest</em> jokes, though. God! Bad puns like you wouldn't believe. He and Piers Anthony should get together, they'd have a blast! C Block is Biology with Mr Jones again, so that's safe. It's nice to have one teacher in common, at least. Katy's in both my sciences, which is good cause it means I have someone smart and serious but fun to do labs with. D-block is Socials with Ms Warren, which I suspect will be a drag. However, I do have a tendancy (as do we all) to make snap opinions of people - and listen too much to the opnions of others - often unfairly. So we'll see. Jay's the only person I really know in that class, although I like Matt Kelly all right, too.<br /><br />So anyway. There's that. It's not really what I wanted to talk about..what I <em>want</em> to talk about is this silly questionnaire thing. I sort of want to brag, and just, well, <em>discuss</em> it, but I haven't anyone to talk to about it (unless I confide in Mum *haha*), so I'm going to have to rely on you.&nbsp;<br />So, we made Kurt and Travis do the survey today at lunch. I don't think they should have done it together, cause it was obvious whose was whose, and I doubt they were entirely honest, but no matter. So here're the facts for the questions that count: of ""our boys"" - that's Eric, Kurt, Travis, and Jon, 2 (Jon and Eric) want Manda, one (Kurt) wants Cayley, and one (Travis) wants me. So you'd think that Manda won. (Not that it's a contest...or at least, I wouldn't admit that out loud to anyone). But. If you look at the 2nd question, all three guys who weren't Travis chose me for their second choice. All three! Travis's second choice was Cayley. Also, 3 out of 4 put me on their desert island (strangely enough, the only one who <em>didn't</em> was Travis - he put Cayley. Hmmm...) So, although Manda and Cayley tie in the Desirability department (Cayley got a first from Lance as well), I think I won overall (that's what I'm telling myself anyway.) There's no one else out of the five of us girls who was picked by every single one of those guys for at least one of those three questions. Not that it matters, of course, since I know that none of them (with the possible exception of Travis, who's frankly off his rocker) really want to sleep with or be with any of us <em>really</em>&nbsp; anyway. Nevertheless, it's a nice little boost to the self-confidence, in my opinion. :)<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :) Autumnal (as in, feels like September!) smudges!! <br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""We were at Jessica's house this evening.""><em>We were at Jessica's house this evening. </em>A slightly different group...all the usual girls (minus Lindsay) but the guys were Kurt, Eric, Eric Cook, and Aaron, another guy whom I think is in grade 12 and who hangs out in the same area of the cafeteria as us. Jessica broke up with Ken yesterday, so he wasn't there. She's been feeling guilty about it (Jessica feels guilty about <em>everything</em>), but everyone agrees it was a good move on her part. It was an odd situation, it made everyone uncomfortable, and he wasn't making her happy, so what was the point.<br /><br />Travis wasn't there because he's been grounded for a month (as I may or may not have said before), but Jessica called him up (or he called her...?), and we all took turns talking to him over the phone. He's actually a really good conversationalist, which Cayley had said before but which I never really believed. He's great at filling in awkward pauses - there just aren't any! He can always think of something to talk about, and it's never boring. That's a great skill, and one I admire - and lack. Anyone who can carry on a comfortable conversation with me is really good! I have interesting ideas about things, and once you get me started, I can talk a lot... I guess I'm like a wind-up toy. I go great once I'm wound, but if no-one's there to start me I don't go much of anywhere. And Travis can do that. It's really neat! Still, I wished that he was with us, instead of just on the phone. I love having Travis there, to cuddle with and feel good around.<br /><br />However, Eric actually managed to fill that position admirably today. He was being quite touch-y, especially after we dressed him up like a vampire and told him he was sexy. We all dressed up, actually. Jessica's got lots of good clothes. I wore this adorable (but kind of skanky) halter-top thing that Jessica had worn as part of a dance routine. It was red-orange and sparkly and exposed my midriff (like, it stopped at the bottom of my ribs), which was okay cause I was wearing my jeans. (Those are the only pants that I look good in topless.) It also had cute little black fringe-y things. It was really neat! I felt sexy (and slutty) in it...although I don't know where the slutty came from...I've been more topless than <em>that</em> in front of those boys. Anyway, Eric said that I looked good in it, which was really sweet - Eric never compliments anyone, particularly me. It made me feel good. And it seemed like he actually meant it...he kept <em>looking</em> at me&nbsp;- it was kinda cool!&nbsp;<br /><br />Jon wasn't there. Not sure why not, except I think it might have to do with the fact that Cayley really doesn't like him at the moment. She thinks he's arrogant and bossy and acts too superior - all of which is true. I still like him, though. I can't help it. I like practically everyone. However, I think that Jon doesn't like me. He said I was a bitch today - that's nothing, people always say that (particularly Eric), but I know they're joking and I don't mind. But I'm not sure at all that Jon was joking. I think he really thinks I'm mean. I mean, we do fight a lot <strong><em>[[Katy, that's not fighting; that's flirting!]]</em></strong> and that's mainly my fault (I suspect that, subconsciously, I initiate that because I'm physically attracted to him and have no other viable way of expressing that), but he hurts me as much as I hurt him. We're actually a fairly even match. But I am kind of mean to him - I don't mean it, of course - I <em>never</em> mean it - but maybe he doesn't see that. Anyway, I've got to talk to him about it. I don't want him - or anyone - to think I'm mean. I'm not - at least I don't mean to be.<br /><br />*Sigh*. At least Eric makes me feel good about myself! :) Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""How did I manage to survive so many years without a group?""><em>How did I manage to survive so many years without a group? </em>It's amazing! I was just reading my journal from the beginning of last year, and there's no one. I <em>never</em> went out anywhere on the weekends. Ever. And I didn't feel at all hard done by. Now, I'm annoyed if we only get together one evening instead of two on the weekend. I don't think I've even really <em>written</em>&nbsp;about much of anything but Excuses and ""Inter-group emotions"" in ...well, weeks, at any rate. I'm so much more social than I was even a year ago. And now that I have that, I think I would really miss it if it left. I also really like having guy friends. That's a fairly new thing, as well. It adds a whole new dimension to things. Maybe when I (eventually) wind up going out with someone (I'm such a coward) it'll be a similar sort of discovery. <strong><em>[[RTE: almost exactly a year away! crazy!]]</em></strong> People - some of them, sometimes, anyway - really aren't all that bad.

The air smelled like spring - I love that smell! It's amazing, you really <em>appreciate </em>the sun in a climate like this. It's probably been at least 3 weeks since we last had a sunny day. Funny thing is, most of the time you don't realize you miss it, and then suddenly there it is, and it feels <em>so wonderful</em>. *Sigh*. 'Course, when the sun went down it got cold again, adn the rapid temperature change resulted in a heavy mist - as far as I can tell looking out the kitchen window, Terrace has been obliterated. Only the Bench remains.&nbsp;<br /><br />Awesome concert tonight - the Peters Drury Trio (plus one). They're these young (19-21) Jazz musicians from Whitehorse - very talented, very hip, and very classy. (Although the drummer's a bit - well, a lot - goofy!) And they seemed to be really enjoying themselves. This one rivals the Bill Hilly Band for Best Concert This Season, IMO (of course, they're completely different kinds of music.) There's still one more concert left to go, too. Lenny Gallant. However, I suspect he's going to wind up being a soulful, introspective singer-songwriter... that's fine in its place, and sometimes I really like it, but it can be really lame, too. Let's hope for the former.<br /><br />Our figure skaters got their gold medal after all! Yay Canada!!<br />Gnight Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""My ears are ringing.""><em>My ears are ringing. </em>I shouldn't be writing. I should be sleeping. I'm going to regret this tomorrow morning (which is actually <em>this </em>morning, but who's counting?) But I have to write, ever so briefly, because my hormones are once again raging.<br /><br />We had a dance tonight (hence the ringing ears); it was the first and last dance of the year, minus the prom, cause no one ever goes to dances at Cal. At first, this one looked like it was going to suck - you can't have a dance with less than 150 people. Eventually, however, the gym filled up - we wound up with probably 175 people. Not great, but hey. Not bad.<br />I actually started dancing almost right away, and it <em>is </em>fun, once you're doing it. I was wearing this sparkly fringed halter top of Jessica's, which was a poor judgement call on my part because I spent a lot of time feeling self-conscious. But it wound up okay.<br /><br />That's not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about slowdancing. With Jon Rife.<br />We danced once at Lindsay's house about a month ago - very briefly, but it was good because we fit properly. So I was hoping he would ask me to slow dance this evening - he's the sort of person who would. However, I always wound up being on the other side of the gym when slow dances were called. I danced once with Travis, but he's too tall. It doesn't work.<br />So, the last fast dance (right before the last slow dance), I <em>was </em>dancing near him, and I concentrated al my thoughts on him: ""Ask me, ask me!"" And he did! So we danced...<br />And it was wonderful. We're the perfect size and shape for each other, we fit right into all the nooks and crannies. He's short enough that I can put my arms around him and lean my head on his shoulder. He's a really good guy to dance with cause he can lead - slow dancing doesn't require much effort cause basically all you do is rock back and forth, but he's very good at gently guiding with his body. He held me close, so there was no air visible between us, and we were touching pretty much along our entire lengths. We weren't grinding or anything, just...touching. Gently. That's a very compelling feeling, very comfortable and sexy. And Jon's such a good person to hold. I didn't want the song to end. But it did. They always do. I don't know if he reacted as strongly to that as I did, but I'll have to make him dance with me again, regardless.<br /><br />NID tomorrow, but I have to teach at nine, and I have my French test (EEP!) at 11. Wish me a ton of luck - I'm gonna need it.<br />Sexy, hormonal smudges. :)<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Hannah Kantola is dead."">She died in a car crash today. The news still hasn't really registered. The words just bounce off...<br />They told us this afternoon in B-Block - Stagecraft. Well, no, actually, they didn't tell us. But as soon as one person says something, everyone knows. We heard it from Chris, who went to the washroom and heard it from someone (everyone) in the hallway. When he said it, my first thought was ""It's not true."" It <em>couldn't</em> be true; it was just gossip, conjecture, it wasn't confirmed. Then gradually people burst into tears and left. At 2:00 the principal, Mr Straker, called an end to B-Block and asked the teachers to meet in the staffroom. He said that the next class would start at the regular time, 2:12. To my knowledge, it never did. I had CAPP, and Mr Walker was there, but he said we weren't doing anything - he expected hardly anyone to show up. And really, how can you expect people to come to class when something like that has happened? I've never seen the halls of Caledonia so quiet - the only sound was crying, and whispers. No one laughed, no one shouted, no one swore. People were clustered in little groups holding each other, and the teachers were moving between them. The guidance counsellors from Skeena were there, and Mrs MacLoed was hugging everyone.<br /><br />I couldn't cry. I still can't. I can't believe any of it - and I can't stop thinking about it. My mind will wander, I'll be distracted by something, but then those words will repeat themselves like a hammer in my brain. Hannah Kantola is dead.<br />Hannah. It's unthinkable. She was the lead actress in our musical this year. She's pretty, funny, bright, a good singer and actress, she's <strong>17 </strong>- and she's dead. End of story. She was one of the most alive people I knew. I didn't know her well - I may have talked to her all of five times in my life - but that doesn't seem to matter. She was a person - a vibrant, friendly person - and now she just doesn't exist. She doesn't exist. It doesn't matter how well I knew her, all that matters is I did know her.<br /><br />How can I talk about a person my age in the past tense? It seems so odd. I know things like this happen to people all over the world all the time, and I know this is a cliche, but...it's not the sort of thing that happens to <em>you</em>, you know? It happens to someone else...<br />Seems to me that this town has had its share of tragedy. Two or three years ago now, the same thing happened, and 2 Caledonia students - Lauralee and a Belgian exchange student - were both killed. Why is that allowed to happen? Who the hell's running this fucking universe, anyway?<br /><br />Hannah Kantola's dead. The thing that that really brings home is, if it was her, it could have been anyone. It could have been Cayley, or Tyra, or Manda, or Jon or Eric or, or, or. Anyone. I can't cry but I can grieve, and if I feel her death this strongly, I can only imagine what her family and her close friends are going through. Fuck! It's too close to home. I saw her in the hallway yesterday, and envied her, just for a moment. She was so pretty...<em>was</em>. Today at lunch we were looking through Jon's photos from the production. She was so very alive...<br /><br />Gawd.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""School today was really depressing..."">(School today was really depressing) - people were breaking down all over the place. In every class, the teachers told us that if we needed to leave to cry, or talk to a counsellor, or whatever, we were welcome to. I didn't, but lots of people did. My CAPP class, our double-block today, was full of production students, and they were all gone. Most people just clustered in the hallways, crying. They've erected what amounts to a shrine by her locker - I haven't had the strength to go and see it yet. Her memorial service will be held next Wednesday afternoon. It's at the REMLee - they were going to use the E-Free, but Ms MacLoed was afraid it wouldn't be big enough. I teach Wednesday, but I'm going to move my students so that I can go.<br /><br />I wish I believed in God. It would be so comforting to know, beyond a doubt, that she is in a better place. I've never really understood religion before, but now I think I do. That must be one of the main reasons why religion developed - it's just too awful to think about otherwise. I can't believe that she's gone completely, though, all the same. I mean, there can't just be nothing - it doesn't make sense. It's unthinkable. Maybe when we die we become part of everything. I dunno.<br /><br />Her body will be cremated, and her ashes sent to New York - she always wanted to go there. Her parents are setting up a Fine Arts Scholarship in her name, which I think is a wonderful idea. I feel terrible for her family and close friends. This has hit me hard, and I barely knew her - they must be devastated. I think the person I feel most sorry for, though, is Kim Rooker, the driver of the car. She's in the hospital in Vancouver, in stable condition (whatever that means). I don't know if she's regained consciousness yet, but just think about when she does. Imagine being the driver of a car in which your best friend died. How could you deal with that. I'd almost rather die myself. Even if it wasn't your fault (and it wasn't) and nothing you could do would have prevented it, the guild would still be massive. The police are blaming it on road conditions and ""driver inexperience"", but that's shit. I saw the film of the road, adn that accident could have happened to anyone, regardless of how long they'd been driving. I just hope no one says anything like that to Kim.<br /><br />We got together this evening and tried to be happy; sometimes that worked and sometimes it didn't. Whenever a sad song played, Eric started crying, and then Katy and Lindsay would start. Even I, who have such difficulty crying, had tears in my eyes. It was a good thing to do, though. No one should be alone in their grief, and brooding is unhealthy.&nbsp;<br />We've had such a disrupted week. It seems like small news now, but there was a fire in the Gym on the weekend, and school was closed Monday so they could clean it up. Wednesday was the Bc Student Walkout - in which I did not take part - and then Thursday was the tagedy. Next Monday the teachers are staging a walkout, so we won't have school again. I feel really sorry for the people writing Provincial exams. Provincials can't be delayed, because everyone in the province has to write them simultaneously - that means people had to write exams today, despite the terrible events. I just can't imagine having to write an exam in this climate - I could barely concentrate on my own trivial assignments. The Grade 12's have to come in on Monday too to write Provincials, despite the Teacher Walkout - I only have 2 exams, C and D block (Chem and English), and they're&nbsp; both on Tuseday. I get the rest of next week off. Hopefully by the time classes resume two Mondays from now, things will have returned to some semblance of order.<br /><br />Sad, crazy times, Kitty. Gnite.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Parents are evil.""><em>Parents are evil. </em>I mean, not really, but they do like to gossip about their children. Mum and Dad had a wine-tasting party (silly concept) this evening, and Kim and Gord (Eric's parents) were among the guests. I was evesdropping - and they were talking about us! I figure if a conversation is about me, I have a right to hear it. So I did. Apparently when Gord drove Eric and Travis home from Lindsay's last night, they were talkign about my squealing. Yes, okay, I admit it, I squeal and moan and generally make fairly sexual noises when I'm getting a massage. I like massages to hurt, and when someone's pressing that hard on your back, noises get squeezed out. So anyway, everyone was terribly amused with this tendancy of mine last night (they laughed at me), and Eric and Travis collaborated to see what noises they could make me make (different areas and different motions illicit different responses.) So Gord told my mum about this. Well, thanks. Yes, and it's clear that we were all at least semi-topless. Well, so what? I'm not ashamed of my upper body! I <em>had </em>a bra on. Rrgh. Anyway. Stupid parents. They shouldn't share information. So it seems like they're expecting us all to pair up and start sleeping with each other any day now. It was at that point that I wanted to inject myself into the conversation and tell them not bloody likely! We talk about it enough, but none of those guys are really interested in any of us, except Travis, who doesn't count. So it couldn't actually go anywhere. They shouldn't worry - we're all perfectly innocent, really.<br /><br />...Happier and sadder, better and worse. It comes and goes&nbsp;- sometimes it's so strong it almost overwhelms me - I nearly cried again today - and sometimes I almost forget, which of course makes me feel even guiltier when suddenly it comes back. And then everything feels trivial and petty. *Sigh* Goonight, Kitty.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Wow, Travis was so HOT today.""><em>Wow, Travis was so HOT today. </em>I mean, really. Jon wasn't there, but if I'd had to revise my ""Sexiest"" list on the spot, I would have put Travis at the top, no question. I'm not sure what it was...partly the attitude, I guess. He was being Nice Travis, which is always good. And his hair was really sexy today. Also, he was wearing his Gay sweater, which always makes him look hot. (Don't ask why, it just does.) Makes him look sort of sensual and brooding. And he does have nice features...sometimes. He's got beautiful, long-lashed eyes, and a very sensual mouth (sort of pouty), although his nose is a bit silly. But Gawd! He's definately too thin, but I could have overlooked that tonight - and I'm not even ovulating. If only he looked like that all the time. Mmm... :)<br /><br />I've been losing weight. Slowly, but I definately notice. I lose about a pound a week, and that's been constant for a few weeks. Right now I'm at 133 lbs - that's the lightest I've been in at least 3 years! And it feels so good - I almost <em>like</em>&nbsp;my body now!<br />Lots to do tomorrow. I didn't really do <em>anything</em> today, but Tuesday I've got my finals in English and Chem, so tomorrow I actually have to study. Also, I've got CAPP and Stagecraft assignments to finish for Tuesday. And I rescheduled Darren and Jenny in for tomorrow - Hannah's funeral is on Wednesday afternoon, and I want to go (everyone needs closure), so I had to rearrange my students.<br /><br />And so it goes...<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""The funeral service was today.""><em>The funeral service was today. </em>The REM Lee was packed - Hannah always like a full house, as Mrs MacLoed pointed out. It was very teary. I cried, really cried - like honest-to-goodness truly tears - for the first time today. It was quiet crying of course, but I almost wished I was home, because if I'd let myself go at that point I would have bawled - and that probably would have been good for me. But I couldn't break down there, not in fron tof so many people.I think the parts where I cried the hardest were when Adam Kerby sang a song that he had written for her, and then, of course, when Ms MacLoed gave her speech. That was the worst. There was a lot of God-y stuff which I stoicly endured, about her being an angel with the Lord now, and all that. I'm sorry, but I just can't buy it. I truly wish I could, but there's something fundamental there in that blind faith that just doesn't sit right with me.<br />They read an excerpt from her journal, and <em>that</em> made me cry too. She was so positive, so bright and happy. It made me think... If I died tomorrow and people looked through my journals, what would they find? Not much. I complain an awful lot both in writing and in reality, and for the most part it's about petty, trivial things. I'm never particularly positive...although I'm not usually excessively negative, either. My glass contains equal parts gas and liquid. Hannah's glass ""was half-full, thank you very much, and refills are free!"" It makes me feel almost guilty. Guilty to be alive, I guess, when such a wonderful person as Hannah is dead. It doesn't seem right. It isn't right. And there's not a fucking thing anyone can do about it.<br /><br />Funerals are supposed to help you reach a catharsis, bring closure. I'm not sure it did. I cried, and that was good, but it'll be a long time before things stop reminding me of her constantly. And maybe that's a good thing.<br />Gnite, Kitty.<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""we had an excuse at Manda's house tonight.""><em>We had an excuse at Manda's house tonight. </em>Seems like it's always at Manda's. It was kind of dumb though - the only guys there were Kurt and Eric. You know, I'm really not very comfortable around Kurt, and I'm not sure why. The rest of the guys are fine...Jon's harmless, Travis is straightforward and easy to understand, and Eric's just a comfortable person all the way round. But Kurt - I dunno. He confuses me. I can't read him, I don't understand him, I can't see what he's thinking. He doesn't communicate, doesn't express himself verbally, and he's so closed off physically that I can't figure him out that way either. He's intellectually a very interesting person...but what does he <em>feel</em>? This lack of communication really weirds me out, especially be everyone else in that group is so <em>easy</em>&nbsp;to read. Everyone communicates their feelings somehow, whether they mean to or not. Except Kurt. And it's driving the Analyst in me crazy!<br />'S funny, but evenings never seem as interesting if Travis isn't there. This sounds kind of odd, but...I find myself doing things <em>for</em> him somehow. As Tyra put it, 'Hey, Travis is already my bitch, let's see how far we can reel him in!"" That sounds cruel, cause really I'm not particularly interested in him, but it's interesting to experiment. I mean, I know he's attracted to me, for whatever unfathomable reason, adn it's fun to see where I can take that. What will he notice? How can I capture his attention? The other guys aren't interested in my anyway, so there's no point, but with Travis it's fun. Jon's fun too, cause he reciprocated. But when it's just Eric and Kurt there, it's...well, dull, in a way.<br /><br />Tomorrow evening people are coming over here, which means I have to get my act together and clean up this room. It's been undergoing renovations (mainly of the ""wall collage"" variety) and at the moment there're papers and junk all over the floor nd the bed (and the walls, for that matter.) I've also made up an anonymous questionnaire (to see what we <em>really</em> think of each other) and that should be fun, if confusing. I'm not sure yet how we're going to orchestrate it, but I'm sure we'll manage. We always do.<br />G'night, Kitty!! :)<br /></div>"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 1/02""><strong>January 1, 2002 (Tues) New Years!<br /></strong>Happy new year! I guess this is what you would call the official start of this journal, since the date on the front says 2002.&nbsp;<br />Another year. Man. (And a palyndrome - how 'bout that?! Won't happen until 2112!!) Seems odd to me. I guess I should make New Years Resolutions or something. I had a good one, but I forget what it was - oh yeah. Actually, there's two of them:<br /><br />1. I will do at least one French lesson a week (on average...hey, let's be reasonable here!) until I finish the Gr11 course.<br />2. I will go to the pool and actually SWIM LAPS every Tuesday possible.<br /><br />That'll do for a start, don't you think? ...I suppose I should be at least a little tipsy, but I don't really think I am. I had part of a Margarita,some EggNog, and a couple of half-glasses of Champagne. Since I don't drink, that should be enough for there to be <em>some</em> consequence. Unfortunately, there's no snow, so we can't go write ""2002"" on all the car windows. A shame.<br /><br />Gosh, I'm tired. If I was at home, I'd either have been at Tyra's or Jon's. That would be fun. But this is fun, too. Martina and I did ""girl-talk"" - I told her about Travis (and the possibility of Jon) and she told me about this guy, Joe, a friend of Paul's who likes her. Paul's got a girlfriend, by the way. Can you imagine?! I mean, actually going out with <em>Paul</em>?! Apparently she's got him totally whipped - like that's a change; his sisters have had him whipped for eventeen years! Oh well, it's good for him.<br /><br />Ugg, I'm tired. It's 2:30/3 in the morning. I'll write tomorrow (althoughit'll probably still be today...)<br />Gnite, Kitty! :)<br /></div>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 2/02""><strong>Wednesday, Jan 2, 2002<br /></strong>I shouldn't really be writing at all - I should be sleeping, and I'll most likely regret this foolish behaviour on the morrow (I have a piano lesson at 9:30.) However, I'm perfectly capable of ignoring that, so long as the punishment for my crimes is several hours away as yet. (That, incidently, is the easiest way to procrastinate successfully, as far as I'm concerned.)<br /><br />Funny how someone with a girlfriend becomes instantly less interesting. I never had a crush on Paul (well, not since Gr 8, and that didn't count), and I would never seriously consider him as a likely candidate for - well, anything - but he was still amusing to think about, and to practise ""charms"" on - and, well, now he isn't. It's frankly boring. *Sigh*.<br /><br />Speaking of, umm, that sort of thing, I wrote Travis a song today. (Aww!) Well, Lyrics, anyway. Not that he'll ever see it, and it's a bit over the top (in order to be poetry material it has to be <em>exciting!</em>), but I needed to write it anyway. It's called ""Thank You""and now I'm officially out of room in that lab notebook. I'll have to find another place for poetry.<br /><br />Went to see <em>Monsters, Inc</em> today. It was cute - I think those computer graphics are so neat; it's amazing what they can do, really. My favourite part, though, was teh Pixar short at the beginning, about birds.<br /><br />Manda's having a ""party"" - in quotes cause it's really just an excuse to hang out - on Friday evening. I don't know whether it's everyone or just girls (more fun with everyone), but if she's inviting the guys then she's chosen the wrong night. That's their D&amp;D day. Kurt and Eric might come (they - well, Kurt; Eric was sick) came to Cayley's thing), but Travis won't come. He's in Asshole Mood at the moment. It'll pass... it always does...<br />Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 4/02""><strong>Friday, Jan 4, 2002<br /></strong>...Knowing someone has a crush on you is just about the best feeling in the world, in my opinion. This opinion was reconfirmed this evening at Manda's Excuse. (That's what I've decided to call our directionless, pointless get-togethers.) Travis was there, and God, he's so sweet. It made me feel so good just to know that he likes me - and he definately still does, I'm sure of it. I guess it kind of sucks for him, but it makes me happy! Yes, that's extremely selfish, I know, but I can't help it. And heck, I've liked 5 guys <em>in a row</em>who didn't like me back. It's not like it's the end of the world. Nor does he seem particularly perturbed, just kind of...broody.<br /><br />Eric was there too. It was nice to see him again; he wasn't there the last couple days of school, so it really has been a while. He's so nice when he's nice (of course, he's also an asshole when he's an asshole, but thankfully that's not most of the time). He's a great person to have as a friend - he'll actually, like, talk to us and stuff, and he's very good about letting us dress him up! Kurt and Jon weren't there - Jon hurt himself snowboarding, and Kurt's still not back from wherever he is.<br /><br />But I'm so glad Travis likes me! It makes me feel...noticed. And needed. It's a wonderful feeling. :)<br />Warm and fuzzy smudges, Kitty. :)<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 10/02""><strong>Friday, Jan 10, 2002<br /></strong>Another emotionally charged evening. (I'm sorry I don't write during the week, but it's just always so <em>busy</em>...) We had another Excuse at Manda's this evening, but this time with practically everybody there. Manda (of course), Tyra, Cayley, me, Eric, Kurt, Jon, and Travis. Jessica was at Lindsay's house, and Lindsay wasn't invited. It was good to have all the guys = it meant we had an even male/female ratio. So we hung out and played stupid, hormonal, sexually-frustrated teenager games. Honestly, I'm embarassed for us - and yet still it's fun.<br /><br />Mainly we played Turth or Dare and Suck &amp; Blow. Things came to a head (no innuendo intended) when Travis picked Truth, and some idiot - I forget who - asked him the One Night Stand question. Basically, if you could have a one-night stand with anyone in the room with no problems as a result (ie no pregnancy, no STDs, no emotional difficulties) who would it be? And someone asked travis. Grr! Like, talk about forcing the issue. Everyone in the room already <em>knew</em>the answer anyway; there was no reason for him to have to say it aloud. Actually, if it was up to me, we'd never mention it at all while we were both peresent in the room, and everyone could just forget about it. Of course, that isn't likely to happen. So anyway - he didn't want to say it, but finally did. ""I'm sorry, Caitlin, but it would have to be you."" I was torn between extreme embarassment and happiness at this confirmation. Embarassment won, though, at least for the moment.<br /><br />Then, of course, no one could just leave well enough alone. I wish they'd put themselves in one of our places for a moment. The whole things was acutely embarassing for me, and I'm sure it could only be worse for Travis. Then while Travis was in the washroom, Cayley asked me a really difficult truth. ""If Travis were to ask you out right now, would you say Yes?"" Well = I honestly don't know. I had to tell her that. Ultimately, I hope not to have to deal with that particular situation, at least not right now. But if he did, I really don't know how I'd respond. I'd probably mutter some excuse - or maybe I'd agree, just out of pity. It's impossible to say.<br /><br />So it was kind of an embarassing evening - but fun, nonetheless. It's always fun. And I got to cuddle! That goes a long way to redeeming any situation. I cuddled with Jon, and Travis, and Eric. Basically, anyone who'd let me. I was in a very huggy mood.<br /><br />But geez. I don't know how this Travis thing's gonna work out. I really hope he doesn't go and complicate things by asking me out or something silly like that. *Sigh*<br />Emotionally fraught smudges. :)<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 11/02""><strong>Saturday, Jan 11, 2002<br /></strong>I was thinking about this today, and here's the question: why on earth would I go out with Travis? I mean, consider it - we have, like, <em>nothing</em>in common, except that we have the same friends. None of our interests are the same, none of our preferences (ie books, movies, music) are the same, and Travis doesn't even <em>have</em> views on issues. What would we <em>talk </em>about, for crying out loud? It's stupid. The relationship would be purely physical. And as regards that, I don't even find Travis particularly attractive - he's not repulsive, certainly ; but if I ranked our 4 guys in order of sex appeal, Travis would be at the bottom. (In case you're wondering - as if it isn't obvious - that list would go Jon, Kurt, Eric, Travis). I mean, I'm very flattered that he likes me (and a fair bit puzzled - there are so many thin, popular, unattainable girls in our school - why would anyone have a crush on me?!), but I don't think a relationship between us could work.<br /><br />Beth's birthday party was tonight. We watched <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>and <em>Summer Catch</em>. The main character in <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>was SO fucking hot! The movie was pretty dopey, but I would have watched it for another 2.5 hours just to keep looking at him. <em>Summer Catch </em>starred Freddie Prinze, Jr, who's pretty cute, but he's got absolutely nothing on the&nbsp;first guy. Wow. We were all drooling.<br />Hormonal (as usual) smudges!! Gnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 17/02""><strong>Thursday, Jan 17/02<br /></strong>This is a wierd pen. I don't really understand it -since it's new and on soft paper, it should write fine, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Anyway. I swear I had something realy to talk about this evening, but now I've completely forgotten it. Oh well...I'll just keep writing as events/thoughts surface.<br /><br />Lost my keys. I haven't seen them since I got back from Beth's on Saturday. Thing is, hey must be here - I only take my keys with me when I'm driving, and I couldn't possibly <em>forget</em>them anywhere, because I need them in order to drive back. But they are nowhere, I swear it! We've looked ""in all the kinds of places hat a [keyring] might be near, and we made the sort of noises that a [keyring] likes to hear."" But to no avail. It's most frustrating.<br /><br />Started going swimming again. Gawd, there are muscles there that I'd forgotten I had - but I remember now! It feels so good to swim; like I'm actually accomplishing something. I feel thin when I'm swimming. My piano exam for Grade 9 is on Saturday. Eek! I guess I'm ready, but I'm not confidant. Oh well. I will survive.<br /><br />We got a CD burner. It's very cool.<br /><br />I'd write more (I <em>do</em> have more I could write) but a) I'm having trouble staying awake (didn't get enough sleep last night - as usual), and b) it's a NID tomorrow and I have to do a make-up lesson with Myranda at 10am (an ungodly hour.) So I'm gonna stop. Watched a weird but cool movie this evening, called <em>The Usual Suspects</em>.<br /><br />I have so much to do this weekend it's almost funny. Not. *(Sigh)*.<br />Stressed smudges, Kitty. :)<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 18/02""><strong>Friday, Jan 18/02<br /></strong>Well. I'd never taken off my shirt (with a bra on, of course) in front of a guy before. Until today. Now both Jon and Eric have seen me (and Cayley and Tyra an dManda) in bras only. Not sure how that happened exactly - it was mainly incidental, at least at first. It worked both way, though, at least - we had Jon down to his boxers - only - for a while there. And we dressed Eric up and he was so fucking HOT! I've never found Eric particularly attractive before, but wow! He looked like Spike, the demon/vampire/whatever from <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, except without the bleached hair. It was really cool. And Jon, of course, was entirely edible - he's got a really cute body; shame he's so sensitive about showing it off.<br /><br />Manda got her ""N"" on Wednesday, BTW. We went ""cruising"" this evening in our two cars - a stupid pasttime (Kurt and Travis weren't there, in case you were wondering. Not sure why). I have my Gr0 piano exam tomorrow afternoon! Eeek! It's extremely scary. Please wish me good luck = exams are always nerve-wracking, and let me tell you, my nerves are wracked!<br />More (equally) stressed smudges, Kits. :)<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Jan 19/02""><strong>Saturday, Jan 19/02<br /></strong>Ok, well, Cayley said I should analyze this, adn I think she's right - it's crush analysis time.<br />I'm talking about the Jon thing, of course. It's really a tough call. I think that - technically - I do have a crush on him, of sorts. I'md definately physically attracted to him - his face isn't always cute and his hair isn't great, but I love his body. It's partially the short thing, I guess, but not entirely. He's slim, but not skinny like the rest of our guys. That's part of it. Skinny is bad. Also, he reciprocates touching I've said this before, I know, but it's seriously amazing - like he initiates stuff! He likes touching. I think that if I do like him, then it stems from that - he respects all girls = he's very courteous and he <em>always</em> knows the right thing to say - and he's willing to hold anyone. I'm sure it's at least partially a front, of course, but he's really nice. He makes me feel more desirable than I am. {{<strong><em>REAL-TIME EDIT: Oh my god! My 16 year old self is insane! Yeah, right, cause boys in generally obviously *don't* want to touch girls. And Jon is the MOST COURTEOUS of them because he DOES flirt with everybody? I still find that flattering, but...good lord, how times change. And...""more desirable than I am""?? *hits former self*</em></strong>}}<br /><br />He's got a brain, too. I mean, his marks aren't anything to brag about, but that's cause he's lazy, not stupid. He really thinks about things. (Yes, I know I'm being repetitive...just bear with me). He's got, like, political and religious opinions. Which he <em>voices</em>! He's actually a really interesting person to talk to.<br /><br />So, I can see why I <em>would </em>like him. Thing is, though, it really doesn't feel like a crush...I mean, I've been through this 6 times before; I ought to know what it feels like. And this isn't it. Maybe it just needs time to develop. I have a suspicion that a lot of the ""throw-myself-at-Jon"" thing (which I have been doing, to a certain extent) stems from my uncomfortability with the Travis issue. Not sure how that works, but that's the feeling I get. &gt;ike I'm trying to free myself from association with him, or something - that sounds really mean, but there it is. Gotta say, though, that I don't think the taking off my shirt thing had anything to do with Jon. That was a me thing only. It's liberating, or something. An expression of the comfort I feel with my body...at least, my upper body. Once I had done it once, I wanted to do it again - and just leave it off. I think I could be a nudist if I put my mind to it.<br /><br />Anyway, there it is, so far. In other news...my piano exam went really well, I felt. She asked <em>really easy</em>technique. Like, really easy. The formula pattern she asked was E+, which is the easiest formula ever, bar none (including C+). Of course, I still screwed it up. Oh well. My pieces were all really good, especially the Prelude and Fuge. I think that's the best I've ever played it. And the sight reading and playback were good too...not sure about the ear training, but then, I wasn't expecting much from it. At least it's over - I'm so relieved!<br />Happy smudges, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Dec 25/01""><strong>Dec 25, 2001</strong><br />So Christmas has come and gone again...it's been doing that with remarkabe rapidity of late; it seems like it was just *last* Christmas, and now here it is again. It was as excessive as usual, of course. Actually, it almost sickens me at times to think of all the money and resources we waste on useless frivolities. (That doesn't, of course, stop me from accepting my gifts, more's the pity.) But it really is a beautiful time - it's nice to be with family and to see people's reactions to your gifts to them. It's always a nice feeligns when you've pleased somebody. <br /><br />Christmas dinner was equally excessive. Someday we (or our descendants) will regret the amount of food we now squander needlessly; nevertheless it tasted really good! And the trifle was especially excellent. <br /><br />I don't really have anything of import to say...I just had to start this new journal. I'm reading a really good book right now. It's called ""A Game of Thrones"" by George RR Martin. It was my gift in the Secret Santa thing we did (mine was Kurt, and his was me, oddly enough). It's an epic fantasy novel - similar in scope to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but a totally different sort of storyline. Each chapter of the book is told from the point of view of one of the (many) main characters. It's also the first book in a trilogy, which is dangerous cause I don't have either of the sequels. It's a neat book, anyway. Different from anything I've read recently. <br /><br />Tomorrow I think we're hiking the mountain behind the house, and Thursday (27th) we're going to the the ""Fellowship fo the Ring"" movie in a theatre that actually has a big screen and comfortable seats! I'm so excited! :) <br /><br />Season's Greetings, Kitty - Merry Christmas. <br />G'nite.<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Dec 26""><strong>Dec 26, 2001 - Boxing Day<br /></strong>Days go by so quickly, it's easy to see how a mere 365 of them can be gone in the blink of an eye...today was no different. I accomplished next to nothing- although I did do a thorough (and long overdue) piano practice. January 19th is only 23 fractions of an eye-blink away, and I have to know those pieces.! I get stressed just thinking about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />We had guests for dinner - Nana and Papa's next-door neighbours, who own what used to be Bruce and Anita's house. Lowell and I were banished cause there wasn't enough room at the table, which was fine. It's actually been a long time since they banished us. Just to make up for it, we acted particularly childish! (After the guests were gone, of course.) And I fell down the stairs; that was fun. No sprained ankles though, thankfully.<br /><br />I wish I had things to write about, but I really don't. Nothing interesting. (Oh yes, and it's SO interesting to write about not having anythign interesting to say.) Mum just came in to tell me to go to sleep, and that we weren't reallybad children. (I guess she was having an attack of guilt or something.)<br /><br />...I don't even have anything profound to say - how stupid is that?! (Very stupid, Caitlin.) Great, now she's talking to herself. I really need to get more sleep - and eat less chocolate! :p Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>
<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Dec 27""><strong>Thursday, Dec 27, 2001<br /></strong>I'm going to try not to write for very long tonight, cause we're really (honest-to-goodness) going on a hike tomorrow, fairly early. WE meant to yesterday, adn then we meant to today, but it never actually got organized. But tomorrow for sure! (That's their story and they're sticking to it.)<br /><br />Tried to go see <em>Lord of the Rings</em> tonight in a big theatre in Kelowna, but by the time we got there, it was sold out. So we bought tickets to go tomorrow afternoon. It's kind of cruel, but I'm sort of looking forward to bragging cause I got to see it early and in a nice theatre. IT's supposed to be a really good movie - apparently it's the book (<em>Fellowship of the Ring </em>only) verbatim. Which is good, but makes for a long film. (3+ hours...like <em>Titanic!</em>) Anyway, I'm really looking forward to finally seeing it.<br /><br />I think I must be ovulating. I've had those sorts of thoughts in my head today. I was thinking of Travis, oddly enough. It's just such a nice feeling, knowing somebody has a crush on you...it's a reassurance that at least <em>somebody</em> cares. ...Although, I think he may not like me anywmore - or at least, he's trying to get over it. See, Tyra told him that she told me that he like me (she was feeling guilty, understandably), and he hasn't really acted the same around me since. It's like he's embarassed that I know. And I can respect that; I mean, if I liked someone and that person knew it, I'd be embarassed around them to. But from this side, it's not at all embarassing. (Actually, come to think of it, Cayley's crush on Kurt completely faded - she forced it to&nbsp;- once she found out that he knew.) He's been avoiding me the last couple of weeks at school. It's kind of cute, in a sad sort of way. I think he's afraid I'll bring it up, or something - which is ridiculous of course; I'd never have the guts. Thing is, though, it would probably be good for us to bring it out in the open and talk it through. More comfortable for everyone. But I don't think either of us is going to make that move. Oh well. I almost wish we could go back to before I knew, and before I knew he knew. I mean, it's great just <em>knowing</em> he likes me, but he was way sweeter before it all came out.<br /><br />Anyway. Enough hormonal babble. I've got more I <em>could</em>say, but it can hold and I need to get to sleep. Why is it that I have too much to say when I don't have time and not enough to say when I do?&nbsp;<br />Goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Dec 28""><strong>Friday, Dec 28, 2001<br /></strong>Well, ironically enough, we <em>didn't </em>wind up doing our hike up the mountain today, even though we'd been talking about it for a week and today was our last chance. We just put it off a day too long - this morning when we woke up it was snowing fit to burst and you couldn't see past the driveway. And after 5 days of lovely weather too...it's like Murphy's Law or something. So instead we hung around and read books and played the piano and talked like we usually do. And packed - we're leaving first thing tomorrow.<br /><br />We <em>did</em>, however, see the Lord of the Rings movie this evening; and it was awesome. Three hours long, and I wasn't bored for an instant. The characters were really well done&nbsp;- I especially liked the way they did Sarumen. I had some difficulty with Frodo - all the hobbits in the movie, himself included, had quite cute, child-like features. My mental image of Frodo looks exactly like Marc Atkinson (the mandolin player from the Bill Hilly band); a sort of rugged, seen-troubles look...definately <em>not</em> child-like. But it didn't take long to adjust, and after a while I didn't mind at all.<br /><br />The did stick to the plot pretty honestly - however, they <em>still</em>left out Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-whytes. I can understand why: if the movie's already three hours long and you have to cut <em>something</em>, that's the only major section you can take out that doesn't affect the plot. Tom Bombadil is a great character, but really it's a cameo part. Oh well. The special effects were superb! The Nhaz-ghul and the Uruk-hai were <em>really</em>creepy, and the Mines of Moria were very cool. There was lots of magnificent architecture; it was really quite a beautiful movie.&nbsp;<br /><br />One critic, according to Riley, thinks that the relationship between the hobbits - and between Gandalf and Frodo (!!) was ""homo-erotic."" !!! What?! I think somebody's reading way to deeply into things, if you ask me. I guess the hobbits touch each other a lot - inasfar as Merry holds Pippin to comfort him after Gandalf ""dies"" and Frodo hugs Sam at the end of the film - but I saw nothing homosexual in it at all; that's just silly.<br /><br />I do hope that it hasn't come to Terrace yet, partly so I can have gloating rights, and partly cause I want to go see it again with all of my friends. It was a great movie, and I don't think they truly could have done a better job of it. Even the absence of Tom Bombadil is acceptable, because of how wonderful the movie was in every other respect.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh hey, here's a political tidbit for you. Our esteemed leader, George W., announced today that ""we don't know whether Osama's hiding in a cave with the door open or with the door closed, but we do know that he's no longer a parasite on the AFghan host."" Aren't you enlightened and reassured? Aren't you relieved that we have men like that running the world?<br />Cynical smudges...goodnight, Kitty. :)<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Dec 29""><strong>Saturday, Dec 29, 2001<br /></strong>Home, sweet, stressful home. God, we haven't been here 4 hours, and already I'm stressed again. Sometimes I wish I could just live in permanent limbo, with no concerns or responsiblities - or at least that I could successfully ignore the ones I do have, which lots of people seem to be able to do. But not I. I've got French and Piano and CAPP and...god, I dont' even want to <em>think</em> about it. So I won't - for the moment.<br /><br />I've got an Arrogant Worms song from their new album, <em>Idiot Road</em>, stuck in my head. It's called ""Boy Band"", and it sounds for all the world like a Backstreet Boys song - like ""I Want It That Way."" It kinda fits my mood (not my stressed mood, my hormonal mood, although I suspect the two are related), actually. I've got my stupid period (again) so my hormones are all in overdrive. It sounds rude and distasteful to say I'm ""horny"" (I suspect that's a word of Anglo-Saxon origin, if it isn't just slang), but that's really a pretty accurate assessment of my physical mood. My body wants to have sex - which is perverse of it, since it's currently busy shedding all my baby cushioning, but I guess it figures once we start we might continue. At any rate, the mental outcome of this is that I'm thinking about boys, and about sex. I think I'm going through guy withdrawal. Our guy sare all pretty much lost causes anyway (and I wonder how they'd appreciate being called ""our"" guys? No matter...), but it's still good to be around them. I haven't been around other teenagers in a whole week! Imagine. Except for at the movie last night, of course, but that didn't really count. Sigh. And then on Monday, of course, we're going to Rupert for New Years, which means Paul. My feelings towards him vary every time I see him, mostly according to the time of the month = and his actions, of course. Anyway, if he's not being a total asshole (which he often is, nowadays - it's a teenage thing) he's interesting. ...Oh, whatever. Just ignore me - this'll pass soon enough. G'night, Kitty. :)<br /><br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Dec 30""><strong>Sunday, Dec 30, 2001<br /></strong>...But it is nice to be home again, for all that. I moved my room all around today - it was long overdue for a change. (As is this pen. Hmmm...) Anyway. Yeah. Now my dresser's where my beanbag chair used to be, and my bookshelf (the little grey one) is where my shelf-table (the old baby changetable) was. I kicked out the change-table and the beanbag chair. I did like having the chair in here, but it smelled more and more like cat pee and just wasn't pleasant any longer. I figure we can leave it in the cat room and let Sasha sleep on it. And the change-table was just taking up space. There was certainly stuff on it, but nothing that a different home couldn't be found for. And now I've got tons more room. It's really amazing how much floor space can be taken up by two not-very-large objects. It'll be hard to adjust to for a little while, but I think it's a good change.<br /><br />Listened to The Barenaked Ladies practically all day while I was cleaning my room, and I now know at least the chorus of every song on the album. I love their stuff! It's really catchy, but it's also got quite clever lyrics, and the rhythms and tunes are complex. Also, their songs are very varied...there aren't really two that are alike on the whole CD. At the moment my favourite song (but it's a tough choice, even this early) is ""Falling for the First Time"", which is about a perfectionist who discovers the joys of failing (nwo why does this resonate with me?) :P<br /><br />Going to Rupert tomorrow. I don't really want to. I mean, it's nice seeing the Gemmells and all, but it's kind of nice just being home. Of course, if we <em>did</em> stay home, I probably would wind up being social anyway. I think Tyra's doing a New Years thing for whoever's here.<br /><br />Seems hard to believe it's another year already. Wasn't it just last Christmas? Didn't we just do all this? *Sigh*. Time scares me. It's just moving so fast - before I know it, I'll be old and my life will be spent. Seems like everytime I blink, we've spun around the sun again. (Sounds like lyrics to a song. Hmmm...!!)<br />Anyway, gnite, Kitty. I'll bring this to Rupert and write there...but probably not til after midnight, so Happy New Year!! Goodnight. :)</div>

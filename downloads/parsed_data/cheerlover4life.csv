I would appreciate it."" yeah well, i gave MRS. CHAPMAN the note and she kept asking me questions and it was making me made and uhhhh! But then she told me that i was going to take the test because it wouldn't be fair to any of the other kids. but it was like 3 or 4 kids and uhhh it made me mad! yeah and when i was taking the test she came behind me and said ""well, at least you have the first 2 right"" uhhh that just shook my nerves! yeah but i took the test and i didn't know like 5-10 questions and it was really bad. So i probably failed that test but that's kay cause i hate health anyways. She told us that we are going to have to watch SLIDES of things!! YUCK!!! i sooooooo do NOT want toooo! they'll be of like STD's and stuff!! GRO0OS!!! Well, the rest of the day was ok. i'm gonna go. bye. leave comments. ONLY 18 MORE DAYS TILL MY BIRTHDAY!!!</P>

"event","<P>sorry i haven't updated in a while....i've just been veryyyy sick! i keep coughing and my stomach has been hurting and my head hurts and my nose has been running and i've been have fevers non-stop. I have missed a whole week of school...that's good! yet...BAD!..because i have to make up fiiiive days worth of work!! this is going to be a really really bad break!! Also the highest my fever has gotten to us 103 and that's really&nbsp;bad because you can die if&nbsp;you reach 104 because your brain fries!!!&nbsp;plus! i was sooooo HHOOOTTTT!!!! i was burning up..no duh...but i waaas hot!&nbsp;And most of&nbsp; all i have had probably, all together, 20-30 hours of sleep from sunday to today, friday!! that's bad and i'm sleepy but i can't sleep cause i keep coughing hard and it hurts! I take soo much medicine that i can't take anything to sleep and help me more!! huuuuuuuhhhh!</P>
<P>I've been to the doc. and she said that i don't have strep throat and i need to take a flu test. wellll right then i was wondering how in the world do you find out if you have the flu....welll trust me i found out and i didn't like it..okay well what they do is the swab your nose and it was disgusting!! well i have the flu and they gave me this nasty medicine and a huge pill....i hate being sick!! but see this isn't anything like the flu i had last year and i'm not throwing up or anything but i'm getting worse!! The horrible thing is i am on for a few days...it's called a nebulizer..or a ""breathing machine"" but it's not for getting air..it's for making a liquid/medicine into air that i breath in and it goes to my lungs and it's supposed to help me stop coughing but that hasn't happened. We went back to the doctor to find out what's wrong...again. and she doesn't really know because she hasn't seen anything like this before and i now have to go to rockdale hospital to get a chest x-ray and get a blood test....but i didn't know that last part and that drove me nuts cause i HATE needles and shoots,...etc. So i was kind of freaking out! Well they took the test and thank GOD they didn't have to do it twice cause they need two test tubes for two tests but they connected them with a reg. tube and everything was fine. The x-ray was a breeze too. Well i have bronchitis and the flu and now i have more different medicine to take and that's just dandy! not! haha Well i have to go have a horrible break! Once again...I hate being sick!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;:(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bye</P>

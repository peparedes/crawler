I must look just like a fool here
in the middle of the road
standing there in your rearview
and getting soaked to the bone
this land is flat as it is mean
a man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
the glow of a brake light.

But your wheels just turn,
down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
you aint showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for
the slightest sign that you might miss
what you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
but I'd settle for a slowdown.

I held on longer then I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
would fade in time.

But your wheels just turn
down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
you aint showed it yet
I keep a lookin' for
the slightest sign
that you might miss
what you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
but I'd settle for a slowdown.

But your wheels just turn
down the road ahead
if it hurts at all
you aint showed it yet
your just a tiny dot on that horizon line come on tap those brakes
baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
Im not asking you to turn back around

I'd settle for a slowdown
come on just slow down
I'd settle for a slow down"

"event","Haruki Murakami: On seeing the 100% perfect girl one beautiful April morning 
One beautiful April morning, on a narrow side street in Tokyo's fashionable Harujuku neighborhood, I walked past the 100% perfect girl. 

Tell you the truth, she's not that good-looking. She doesn't stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn't young, either - must be near thirty, not even close to a ""girl,"" properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She's the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there's a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert. 

Maybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl - one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you're drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I'll catch myself staring at the girl at the next table to mine because I like the shape of her nose. 

But no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can't recall the shape of hers - or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It's weird. 

""Yesterday on the street I passed the 100% girl,"" I tell someone. 

""Yeah?"" he says. ""Good-looking?"" 

""Not really."" 

""Your favorite type, then?"" 

""I don't know. I can't seem to remember anything about her - the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts."" 

""Strange."" 

""Yeah. Strange."" 

""So anyhow,"" he says, already bored, ""what did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?"" 

""Nah. Just passed her on the street."" 

She's walking east to west, and I west to east. It's a really nice April morning. 

Wish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and - what I'd really like to do - explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock build when peace filled the world. 

After talking, we'd have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed. 

Potentiality knocks on the door of my heart. 

Now the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards. 

How can I approach her? What should I say? 

""Good morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?"" 

Ridiculous. I'd sound like an insurance salesman. 

""Pardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?"" 

No, this is just as ridiculous. I'm not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who's going to buy a line like that? 

Maybe the simple truth would do. ""Good morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me."" 

No, she wouldn't believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you're not the 100% boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I'd probably go to pieces. I'd never recover from the shock. I'm thirty-two, and that's what growing older is all about. 

We pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can't bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She's written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she's ever had. 

I take a few more strides and turn: She's lost in the crowd. 



Now, of course, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical. 

Oh, well. It would have started ""Once upon a time"" and ended ""A sad story, don't you think?"" 



Once upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened. 

One day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street. 

""This is amazing,"" he said. ""I've been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you're the 100% perfect girl for me."" 

""And you,"" she said to him, ""are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I'd pictured you in every detail. It's like a dream."" 

They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It's a miracle, a cosmic miracle. 

As they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one's dreams to come true so easily? 

And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, ""Let's test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other's 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we'll marry then and there. What do you think?"" 

""Yes,"" she said, ""that is exactly what we should do."" 

And so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west. 

The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other's 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully. 

One winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season's terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence's piggy bank. 

They were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love. 

Time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty. 

One beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew: 

She is the 100% perfect girl for me. 

He is the 100% perfect boy for me. 

But the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever. 

A sad story, don't you think? 



Yes, that's it, that is what I should have said to her."

It says.....

Erika,

You probably already know that I'm leaving. I knew this would be better if I wrote a letter explaining the truth about how much I care about you. The truth is, is that I never loved you, I hated you so much, you are my whore and don't you ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never wanted to talk to you, and be around you. You really have no clue how much I hate you. Now that I'm leaving I thought you should know that I hate you whore, you never did the right thing, and you were never there. I didnt think I could hate someone as much as I hate you. And I never want to see you, for the rest of my life, I will never miss kissing you like before, I never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will not miss you and thats a promise. You never had my love, and I want you to remember that. Whore you keep this letter because this may be the last thing you have from me. I hate you so much. I will not talk to you soon..... Goodbye!
- Ricardo

[Erika begins to cry, she throws the paper in the garbage and crys.]

....A day passes, she is sad, depressed and she feels so lonely.... Then she gets a phone call....

Girl: i just can't believe this happened i thought he loved me.

Friend: o, about that. Ricardo left me a message a few days ago. he told me to tell you to look in your jacket pocket or something...

Girl: ummm ok

[She finds a piece of paper in the jacket]

It says...

Baby I hope you find this before you read my letter. I knew your dad might read it, so I switched a few words...

Hate = Love

Never = Always

Whore = Baby

Will not= Will

........ I hope yu didnt take that seriously because i love you with all my heart, and it was so hard to let you go thats why i wanted you to run away with me...
-Ricardo

Girl: omg its a letter, ricardo does love me!!, he must of slipped it into my pocket when he hugged me. i cant believe how stupid i am!!

Friend: lol ok but i g2g... call me later

Girl: *happy* ok bye, i'll be at home waiting for my baby to call me!!

[Erika turns tha T.V. on]

[Breaking news] ""An airplane has crashed. Over 47 young boys died, we are still searching for survivors... This is a tragedy we will never forget, this plane was flight 1-80...it was on its way to an all boys boarding school..."" Reporter says.

[She turns off the tv.... 3 days later, she kills herself, because of the fact that Ricardo was dead and she had nothing to live for...]

....A day after that the phone rings. Nobody answers. It was Ricardo, he called to leave a message. ""Its Ricardo, i guess your not home so, I called to let you know that im alive, i missed my flight b/c i had to see u one last time. so i hope your not worried. I am staying for good. Sorry if you got scared, i promise to make it up to you, everything will be a be okay i love you so much...call me asap bye!!

[He eventually finds out what happened, and also kills himself.]"

"event","well today i went over to my grandma's friends house to help her do some work around her house she gave me 20. It took about 2 hours to do. Then i went over my grandma's house which is 3 houses down. Then i painted her garage for 20 more dollars so today i made like 40 dollars. When since i was in saginaw i went shopping for awhile. I went an bought the new brad paisley cd. So far is a really good cd. except for the fact that it talks about girls. Well since i dont have one and more then likely never will i sort of kind of get depressed just a little bit. Okay to the point of me wanted to go out to the store   buy a 12 pack and just listen to the brad all night and drink the night away. I dont really know why i feel so sad around stuff like that. I mean most of the time i dont care that im alone at times it can be really really fun then other times it really sucks. I mean i do have friends but i mean have a girlfriend. I think what really did it for me was the fact that victor has a girlfriend. I happy for him and all but i really never saw the day he would have a girl.(no offense to him he's an aweome guy). HE used  to only think of porn all day and the get laided. Wow how did he get a girl. Well he actually try unlike me. Well at one point in time i though that hey if a girls like me they can come to me. Well it did work a couple of times but the girls where all freaks either that or they just arent my type . Hell maybe i should just try  for once. Thats the worst that could happen. Everything  Well the problem i seem to have now is that i not afraid to talk to them like i was 2 or 3 years ago  im just  afraid wow i seem to be writing a lot of run on sentences. Oh well like i was saying i can be fine with a girl when it just me and her no problem bob but for some reason with other people around i seem to get shy and distant. I dont know why i just do. Maybe it because im shy that could be it depends who you talk to some say i am some say im not . Or it the fact that i fell like everyone is staring at me waiting for me to do or mess something up. I fell like im being watched and it scares the heck out of me. Once again i shouldnt care what others think. But i do wow i cant seem to make a sentence. I think half of that im saying is spelled wrong. But who cares it like 2:30ish. Im still up and i dont fell like going to bed. Maybe i should actually try to get one. Well i think i have destroyed my chances with one. I never really called well my phone was destroyed but then again i have a new one and i still never call. I really never really can anyone most of the time they call me. I think it goes back a ways when i called wEll i guess i can say her name nay you know who im talking about. WEll i guess i called her to much and now im afraid of doing the same thing again to someone elsa. Hey i cant live in the past  now can i? . Hot dogs are done. What the hell am i doing eatihg at 3 in the morning im hungry. I know i know i going to get fat but who cares. anywasy IT seems like  i ever get rejected online. THe one girl or girls i seem to get are all way to young like 12ish. HEll i got and idea i should wait like 35 years. SO that way im about to retire and then i can get some young 20 year old and she can or will date or marry me for my pension. Sounds good to me. well so what do i do about the next 35 years before i retire. Well how about i should  just have fun and go to college and stop bitch. sounds good to me. Damn brad paisley i hate you now.                     by the way sorry i cant spell"

Well i want to well become a history teacher. WEll for the longest time i have always though i was to stupid to become one but the more and more i think about it im not i just have to apply myself more and actually try. Im not sure what grade i want to teach but i really belive that this is for me. It would be a rewarding career and they get good benifit and the pay isnt to bad. plus summers off. Not that im going for summers off i going because i want to make hisory fun instead of boring as watching paint dry. I belive i can at least touch a few people lives into become a teacher also. Well for example mr. johnson my history teacher it's really because of him that i actually like history. HE made it fun most of the time. But there were times when it was really boring like when we were watching movie so of them where boring but other then that it was an awesome class. I just want to teach history and hopefully give someone the same passion that i have for history to them. I want to make them want to come to my class everyday and want to learn more and more. I belive that this is my calling for now heck maybe in 10 years i might try something elsa but maybe i will stay and retire from teaching you never know. So i going to start class this winter at delta so here i go.(jumps feet first in water) Wow i though it would be cold guess i was wrong."

"event","well the cops didnt press charges and it looking back on it now it still dont know what the hell we were think but oh well hey maybe we should go pop hunting again i miss dont that my i dont think anyone want to go anymore with me it  like when we go toby and melissa either talk and not look for bottles or one of them falls asleep well maybe i should just go my myself i do need the gas money. maybe tomorrow if i wake up i might go and just bottle all day. Oh maybe i will see if melissa wants to go or toby or both as long as then dont fall asleep on me again it will be just fine.I really miss going bottling and junking but maybe it just me i dont know either that or it the 2 1 liters of mountain dew talking about know one wants to do that kind of stuff anymore. Maybe im right maybe im wrong either that i or dont ask anyone if then want to do this kind of stuff because i think that they dont want to do it but really they do but i dont ask them. It's one of the two i know it is. Since i have been working alot lately i have had to to watch the only show i like to watch smallville it seems like every time im home to watch it some either calls and wants to to something  and then i dont have the balls to tell them im busy watch tv because them  i it makes me sound like a lazy ass. But who cares if someone calls and it not an emergency and then call at 7 i am going to tell them im watching smallville. If i haning out with someone then i dont care if i watch it because im not home to watch it but if im home i wanted to watch it. Maybe i should just by the 4 season on dvd so i dont have to watch it at 7 that works too. So for now on if you call at 7 im watching smallville im busy leave me along for a hour unless your dieing or about to die you can wait and hour. well my sister tape smallvile for me so im going to go watch it. I dont know why but it seems like at night is  the only time i have to myself. Sometimes i just want to you know go somewhere and just be by myself and have me time and it seems like night time is the only time i have so im going to use it all i can well im off to watch smallville later"

we went to birch run looking for some cans there but they already got them. Then we decided to head to bridgeport looking for some cans didnt find any. Then we decided to go to mutn. Well we were thinking with are ass and not are brains. I think the pop Gods had us in a spell or something.Well anyways we went undereither the fence. We found some cans but not to many. Well then i think mel saw a cop and we got scared and he hid undereither the bleacher on the home side of the field. Well the cop came by the first time i was almost standing up and i swear he say me. I guess i was wrong. Well then i went back by mel and she was like dont leave me. Then the cops past by again like 4 times in like a 30 minute period. Then i was asking mel if she just wanted to give up because he were already 6 feet under. She sayed she didnt know. So we both prayed and waited and waited. THen the cops finally saw us. He was like gentleman come on out. I was the first one to get out and he was like down on the ground. I was trying to tell him that he were doing there but he wouldnt listen. So i did what he sayed. THen he hand cuff me and made me stand by a fence. Then one of the cops asked me ""who the hell do you think you are coming into my town like this. I was like im no one sir. Then after that the cop told me to get that smile off my face. he slammed my face in the fence pole. i was like ouce that is going to leave a bruise. mel sayed it sounded like he slapped me. I really dont remember smiling at all i think he is full of crap because he was behind me not next to me and he was on my left side and my head was towards the right slightly because i could see the small building next to me and if my head was straight like it was early i woulnt have saw it. Then after that one of the cops was like im tired of babysiting you so he made me bent down and cuff me to a post. Then after that i was wondering where toby was at i almost forgot about him. Well he was fine. Then the cops made us get back over the fence and he told me as soon as i get over the fence to grab the fence. if i was going to run i think i would have ran a long time ago. Then he asked me if I owned a white van i was like no. HE was like yeah you do. he was like you have to have you mommy come. Then i relized it was my mothers van. how did she get here. does she have mom vision or something. WEll come to find out toby called my house and my mom and sister came and got toby because he didnt know that to do. Well then they started question toby about everything. They though toby was on something because he was so nervous. Well the cops were going to look though me car but they didnt. Well then after that we were let go and the cop sayed if they press charges you will be notivied and a warrent for you arrest be issused. So i have 13 days left to see if i get arrest it that doesnt include weekend that would be tell the 30 of this month wow long time i hope it does include weekends. well toby i very sorry for that i did and i learned my lesson this time trespassing and looking for cans isnt worth it at all. The moral of the story is think with your head not your ass"

"event","well i think i have found out why i sometimes have breathing problems once in a while. Well i think im allergic to bleach. well because the first time i had an attack the day before i used bleach to clean the tub and then next day i fell light headed and then it felt like  i just rain a marathon and felt like i was going to die and then i think it was yesterday i started sneezing for no reason well the day before the manager at work put bleach down something and i smelt it the next day i was sneezing now stop. Then today he did the same thing but so far nothing yet but i think i going to just stay up all night and watch the sun rise and then see if i start weezing because i hate waking up weezing my butt off. So if i do start have problems i know what im allergic to so then i shall go to the doctor and see what he can do for me. Then on top of that it seems like every time i eat something i get heart burn. Im not talking about the kind where you just have a little bit im talking about the kind that makes you think you are having a heart attack. Like it only happens like once or twice per meal. I take a bit of something maybe once or twice and wow it feels like im going to pass out so i fight it and then it goes away and then a few minutes later another one then it gone . Then im fine i think it could be because of my diet. well for startes im drinking pop that really the only thing i can think of that could be it. At work all i get is chicken chicken and more chicken. Then i dont eat at home because im working by the way i lost 5 pounds for not eat ing at home. Maybe i should move out maybe i will lose some more weight either that or i will just eat more junk food and get fatter. well today at work some lady told me that i hold my fork left handed but im right handed i dont know how the hell i can hold my fork left handed in the right hand either that or maybe im really left handed and dont know it. well anyways i forgot what i was talking about sorry crs(cant remember shit ). Well let me tell you about my day today. well today i woke up at 10 decided to go to work to get my check yeah money. Well i own 140 to my car damn car well now im only left with like 35 dollars but oh well it will last me i think tell next week. So if anyone wants to borrow money im poor so dont ask. well after that i went to work at 1130 and it was really slow so the manager was like you want to leave at 4 instead of 5 i was like sure why not. Because it was either me or i think her name is becky but she spells it different anyways her tattoo got infected and she took like 1 week off to get it look at at fix and she came back to work today and well she needs the money more then i do she owns like money for the doctors fee and stuff like that so i let her stay. well then i got out of work and decided to clean my room so it looks alright. Wow i just realized that i didnt change she sheets oh well. Well then i decided to go online and then i clean my car a little bit to get the dounts out of my car. Then toby came over and then amanda and stacy called wanted to hang out we were like sure why not melissa at college and theres really nothing to do so sure. So we went to the meijers and met jeff there and we walked around for like 2 hours and then we went to the ve for a while then we dropped toby off and then we went up to conlees and then i got some gas and then we drove around with matt for awhile and then i dropped people off and then i went home and here i am now talking to you. well i dont have to work tommorrow but i know then are going to call me in to work they always do i dont know why it seems like people call into work way to much there but hey i need the money im not complain wait yes i  was but in a good way. Okay fine i was complain but more money for me. can you believe it almost labor day already. Do you know what this means it has been almost one year since Melissa,toby and i almost got arrest for well getting pop can from the frankmuth high school wow well i think i should go find that journal and re post it but i so later"

"event","Well today i woke up at 9:30 and fell back asleep watch tv on the couch. THen i got ready for work then i went to work at 11am and then next think I know it's like 5 pm wow that went fast. Well the rest of the night went by really slow. SO when i got out of there at 8 it felt like 12. So then i went home took a shower and decided to go show my dad the truck i wanted to get. Well he was tell me that how about i just give you the van you dont need huge gas hog. We was like i kind of want you car and by i want a maliba. So he was like let trade for the week and then i will decide. So if he doesnt want my car im still going to buy the truck. IF he does want the car i going to save up like 50 dollars a week and in say next year if the van last me  that long then go buy a truck. That way i will have most of the money and it will be pay off or almost payed off i can wait for a truck right? right THis way i wont be like other people who still own like 5 thousand or more on vehiciles still make payments i will just pay it all at once. Who cares if i would get creidit this way. I still have credit cards. Matt was tell me to just get the truck well he just wants to drive the damn thing thats all. I look at it as i dont have to pay 150 dollars a month anymore. THis way i can save up for a new truck and maybe even go to college but it will cost me more to fill up so it would waste the gas like a truck but without the truck payment. Well then i decide to just see how much gas i actually waste driving the van so i decide to go get some gas i drove through clio then mt. morris wow 257 good enough so i put 10 in i was a little bit below a quarter now it a little above a quarter. There goes my ten then i bought a pop and then i drove around some more first i went by the field near toby house. IT was dry but still fun then i went to a huge trail by the burt rd expressway bridge. Well the way down was kind of steep. Then the van started to botton out a lot. SO then i was like i should get out of here i need a huge truck with mudding tires on it. SO i put in in reverse and what do you know i cant get out it was kind of like drive on a ditch and have a sand bar in the middle of it. So basically the van was trying to go in reverse but the frame of the van was on the bar and the tires where spinning in the air. SO then i decided to put in back in drive and try to go down on the path. When i look at the trail and there was at this huge puddle. it had to be at a huge hole there to. So i decided to try to go around it since i wasnt getting out i might as well try to mudd the rest of the way through the trail and worry about getting out later. Well the path i then took had the same problem that the top did so once again the frame of the van was  hitting the ground and the tires where slowing rising and the van was flying on air and i slowing got stuck. SO i decided to try to rock it out it would on about the fifth try i didnt try it to hard i did wanted to kill the transmission like the dodge. SO then i decided to get the hell out of there before i get up shit creek with out a paddle. So then i made the long trip back and ever bump the van went at flying in the air wow wow. You really have to have like a huge ass monster truck just to go in there. So then i started to go back up the hill. The only part i could drive on without getting stuck was the side. But once again the van wouldnt make it.I started rolling backward and getting stuck so the i decided to just use the bar in the middle and pray that i the van doesnt miss the sand track. Well it finally work and then i got the hell out of there. But i was really fun next time i think i should go steal a monster truck. Well then courtnay called and  i hung out with courtney for a while and then we went and saw matt at conlee's and talked there for a while and then courtney and i went for a drive and now im talking to you. Well i guess that is all for now. maybe later i will tell you about yesterday."

"event","Well let me tell you the good news. The new season  of lost starts september 21 cant wait,also tomorrow brad paisleys new cd comes out cant wait to listen to it. Well now on to the bad news well first my family came home well as soon as i came in the house then were not really yelling oh wait they were all yelling at me for one thig or another. Like i guess i forgot to lock the back door. wow the day then come back i forget to lock it of all the luck. Then my sister was like did you  change the rabbits tray every day. Stuff like that. The list goes on and on and on. Well I think i should just go rent a motel in muth for like 12 dollars a day i get a discount. The place comes with cable internet fridge. So i think i should just pack up my stuff and stay there for the weekend and then come home for the week day. Now on to the other bad news gas is now 2.75 a gallon wow but oh well. Well i think it was wednesday Melissa and i went to see dierks bently in concert in detroit at the state fair. Well i left at like 9am to get tickets for the show it started at 7pm. I made it there by 10.15. Then i had to pay 5 dollars to park. Well then they i got out of the car i decided to ask the car parker lady When the collusion was. Which was that they called the place where concert take place at. she was like you mean the strip club. IT was really fun you had to be there. Then then i went and got 2 tickts then i came home and then went to work at 12 and then  left at 5 to go pick melissa up and then we raced down to detriot and then we waited for the concert. Well then i was getting thrist so i decided to go buy a beer so i bought a hard mikes for 6 dollars. It seems like beer taste better when you pay more for it. Either that or you just apprciate it a hell of a lot more and your like wow i wastes 6 dollars on a beer . So it better be damn good. well then the concert start and it was really good. HE played for like an hour and a half then we left and decided to go driveing around detroit i was looking for a steak and shake. Well i didnt find one. When as we were driving there was a car that has staled so me and melissa decided to help them out by helping them move there car off the road. Then we went to popeyes chicken it was good but not as good as my 6 dollar beer. Well then we came back home and i went to bed and that's is the end of my trip to detriot.  Well today i woke up at 5am to the sound of my alarm going off. I set it the other day for toby because he spend the night and had to leave at 5am well it went off so i turned it off and then it went off again. and again. Then i finally got it to stay off i couldnt go back to bed but then i finally did and then i woke up my neck  was killing me and for some reason i couldnt breath for the life of me. At one point i think i blank out for a second or so. I was like well i guess it my time to go. When i got up and found some medicane  Then then i fianlly found  some medicane to calm me down it took a good hour or so for me to start breathing better. Do you know what it like not to be able to breath it basically like being under water for to long and your trying go get up to the top to breath.  OR it like some dude sit on top of you and squising you to death  i was  basicaly short of breath  it was like a ran a marathon or something and i couldnt get my breath i was sitting on the couch thinking wow i should call into work and go to the hosptial if the medicane doesnt work in a couple of hours  Im going to die and then i was like i should make a will then i was like well who should my car go to and then after i started to relax and think of something elsa i started breathing much better.  and then i went back to sleep tell about 10.30am  then i went to work and took more of the breathing stuff so i do die again. Well i was afraid that i was going start having problems at work so i wasnt concertration on working i was just concertration on breathing. Well after about 3pm i started felling better about breathing so  i started actually working. Then the rest of the day was easy. I think when i clean the tub with the chemicals i used that's what made me almost die. So for now no more clean the tub with out a masks on. So other then the fact that i almost dies my day was just fine. Well i think i should go and find something productive to do so later"

"event","I can't sleep, this is so stupid, I don't know what's going on, I don't believe I slept much at all last night, if I even did. *sigh* What is going on? Oh well maybe tonight i will get some sleep. Well last night i decided to sleep outside by the fire me and toby made. Well at like 4:30 i decided to go in because i kept getting bite. Then when i went inside i still didnt get much sleep. IT seems like i have to go to bed at like 3am before i get tired. Even then i just seem to sit there and never really fall asleep then at like 10 or 11 am someone ends up waking me up some way or  another. So i really only get like 6 hours of sleep. I think what i should do is just stay up all night and then go to bed at around 8pm tomorrow and that way i can get some sleep. Then wake up at around 8am. So that way i can get 12 hours of sleep. Well knowning my luck someone will call me up wanted to do something. Well here's an idea turn my phone off.  So if someone is reading this right now and you want to hang out with me and my phone is off leave me alone. But if it keeps ringing then i more then likely up. Well anyways today i went pop collecting with melissa. We made about 5 dollars or so. So it was worth it i guess. 5 more dollars in my gas tank. Well luke wants to start up a lawn mowing business.  I might as well all we would have to do is get flyers and put them at gas station in otisville and columbiville for now and see if people call us at all. We would charge like 20 dollars a lawn. We then had the idea of start a company accout we would but like 5 dollars of every lawn we cut to pay for gas and stuff like that. Then if we wanted to we could open and accout for ourself and put 5 in that one as well. So we really be only make like 10 per lawn but that still really isnt that bad. Well anyways i think im going to try to go to bed so later"

"event","Hello how are you doing? Good Well sorry for not updating you sooner but i kind of forgot about it for awhile. Well anyways i did quit cutco and the dude was like oh okay. He didnt care but then he gave me the price list and the guide and he was like if you still want to sell you can i would still get commicion on the knifes. Well then i answered and add in the paper for a drive. which turned out to be another sales job. But i was going to try it but everyone was like this job is better but it cheaper to get a real job. MOSt of the people that work there dont make money. Only a few do. The company hires like 20 people at a time and then only liek 2 or 3 of them actually sell and the stuff and dont quit. So now i have a job at FBr(frankmuth bavarian Inn. I start tomorrorow at 2 and then saturday at 1 and sunday at 12. So i will have 30 hours in three days. The interview lady sayed that  maybe 1 day during the week. so i should get  about 30 to 40 hours. Well other then that nothing much is new. Yesterday i decided to go for a swimming in the cass river it was really really warm but if felt kind of strange in there because i kept thinking thta this water might have e-coli or something and im going to come out of the water with 3 eyes or something. Well that' really it there isnt to much to talk about so later bye."

"event","well today i woke up at around 11ish. Then i decided to get something to eat so i made myself a sandwich and then i watch like 1 hour of sliders. Then i mowned the grass. IT took about 2.3 hours to mown the grass but it was really easy and i kind of enjoy mowning the grass. WEll then i decided to take a shower which i havent done since sunday. SO then i had to get ready for my interview at 5 in saginaw for the driving job i called about. Well When i got there i found out that the job pays 15 per appointment  plus 5 dollars extra for gas. So 20 per appointment. Well from what i told the company basically sell air purifiers. At first i though it sounded some what like cutco but then the lady was like you dont have to call anyone at all. well people call the company and then the company get there address and then the company set up the time and everything for you to be there by. So all i have to do is drive over to the persons house and show them the product and how it works. Plus say they buy one. Every time someone buy one i get 100 dollars. The minimum for app is 15 per week. So say i do 15X 20 =300  so i would get 300 dollars. Then lets say that about 5 of those people buy then i get 500 plus the 300 so 800 well minus taxes. But it sounds to good to be true so i going to take sure i dont have to call friends and relative like with cutco. As long as i dont have to call anyone im all set. So im just hopeing that this job will work this time. I dont want to have to waste all that gas for nothing. Also i hope then dont have meeting every couple of days. From what im told then have health benifit after 90 days. SO why would a company that is a scam have benifit they wouldnt so i hope it's not. Training is from 12 to 5 tomorrow i hope it does well. IT sounds to me like it's one of those jobs where the more work you do the more money you can make. SO if i do more presetation i get more money. Self motivation i guess. Well i hope i can motive myself to make some money. well anyways i should be going to bed so later bye."

"event","hello well today i woke up on the couch with  the tv on. I guess i feel asleep watching tv. Well then at around 11 i went with toby to subway. Then i headed out to reese i think to do another cutco presentation it went really well and ihad fun doing it also. Well then i came back home. My aunt called and wanted to know if we wanted to go blueberry wait i think it was other kind of berry but im not sure. Well anyways we did that for like 2 hours or so when we came back home and i decided to get something to eat. Well there wasnt much so i just made well a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and 2 grill cheese sandwiches. When i decided to go for a drive and find something to do well there wasnt to much to do then either. Then i saw a sign saying lost cow call some number. Then i had the bright idea  of trying to find a lost cow. So i drove around for about an hour looking for a cow. I never did find that cow but i did find some horses but no cow. OH well maybe i will look somemore later on. Well now there isnt anything to do so i think im going to take off and go find that damn cow so more or maybe i might just look for a alien why im at it well later have a great night and yeah it was nice talking to you bye."

"event","well today i had to go to some meeting in lansing at MSU for cutco. Well it was  like four hours long. WEll all they really did was talk about how you can make better sales. When should you some ways as to how to drop down the price list. I feel kind of weird going down the price list without asking the customor if he/or she actually want to buy a set. So i have asked them if then would like to buy a set and if they say no well then i go over how much the cheaper sets are and then i just show them the other stuff. I seem to sell a lot of small stuff anyways. I sold like 3 vegables peelers that way. IT save me time and them time by me not dicking around with something they cant afford or dont want anyways. IT seems like if i went down well the stairs as they like to call it, It would take longer and well waste the person time because they dont want it anyways. Kind of pressure them to buy something it seems like. Most people have in mind that they only want like 1 or 2 things anyways. Then the one that want to buy the whole set cant at the time but when well when they have the money. Well the meeting was really just a waste of my time. They had all the people who sold the most get up on stage and tell everyone how much they sold and then the top 10 got trophys. Well then they talked about how if you sold over 3,000 dollars worth of sales in the next two weeks you can earn well i trip to the great lakes manager house for a barbaque(cant spell). Well then they have more prizes. Like the boat which is basically a huge event that you have to dress up for. But you have to be top 75 sales. Then if you sell more you get to go to a huge 3 day party in florida. Which you have to kind of pay for depending on how much you sell. Wellso for im 5 for 11 which really isnt that bad. I think what im going to do is try to find a differnet job i keep cutco for a side job for awile. Well today i was suspost to get a check from cutco. Well they are suspost to come in the mail on mondays Well it didnt come. unless it's mailed out on monday. Either that or they didnt have the right address or they arent going to pay me. Well if they dont im taking them to court so i can get my damn money. Im dont have that much money and i will do anything to get my check even if it isnt that much money.  Well anyways that to the person who gave me the links to the cutco stuff I look through it and i think it might really be a scam in one way or another."

"event","well i havent updated in a long time. Well today  IM sister and i were invited to go up north to my mothers/dad/sisters/ friends/family. Well it's a long story well anyways we got up there at about 12ish and we eat some lunch then we went fishing for while then we went swimming for a long time it was really fun. As we were swimming we were eating at the same time. Well then we watched a movie and then we had some dinner and then me and my sister had to go home. well we got on 75 and we decided to go see my grandma's old cabin which she sold like 5 years ago. Well i have to say it looks just about the same as it did 5 years ago. The  only thing new was the house around it were more like houses then they were cabins. So that just means more people live there year round. well then we walked to the beach and then we got back on 75 30 minutes later. NOw im here with writing to you wow. Well i did get a little sun burn but oh well it was really fun. Then sayed that if they can get the boat working that maybe kt and i could come back up. Well if she doesnt want to go i just go by myself or i might just take someone not really sure yet. Well anyways i should be going to bed i have some kind of stupid meeting for cutco. I will bet you 20 dollars that all it  really is, is a big well confidence booster for the sales person. Then are trying to get them fired up about selling cutco. Then they will tell you there story of how they got into cutco and how much they sold and so on and so forth. It sounds like one big scam to me. Having younger well no offense to anyone including me  they just using Us to sell there product and then know if they got a real sales peson they would have to pay them better and give them people to call. But oh well at least im getting some money out of this whole thing. Well at what cost you might ask. Well i shall show you. Well number one three days worth of trainng. 20 miles away. at 30 miles per gallon time 3 days so i burned 3 gallons of gas.  for those three days. plus at 2:35 a gallon that  6 something for three days. On top of we didnt get payed for training. Well on top of that every day you have to call the manager at 8 in the morning  to call to tell him how many sales you have which really sucks Well that really isnt that bad. Well they say you get 14:50 and hour. Well you have to do presentations first. SO far i have done about 14 or so. So i got some money right there. Well then when you get done with your presentation you then have to ask the person if they can think of anyone that would be interesting in buying the product. Well the company wants  the person to call there friends/family member right away. So far most have sayed oh i cant think of anyone at the moment but i will let you know when i think of someone. So far i havent got any reference from anyone. So this is why i cant make any money well i have to go but i will continue on this subject tomorrow later."

on a trip to find a reason
and all i find is hell

i'll abandon ship
i'll save myself
close my eyes, if only for my health

please help me, i'm sinking down

i sit alone in comfort zones
wondering what awaits outside
but i'm sure it's nothing new
so i'll keep hiding myself inside

following the wind to find the home
that i've lost so many times
when i reach land, what's right for me
always waits on the other side

so i'll abandon ship
try to save myself
close my eyes and pretend it's for my health

please help me, i'm sinking down

i've been lost at sea
set adrift for far too long
all those thoughts went to waste on me
the life i had is gone"

i have a name, but won't wear it out
yours sounds rehearsed
this is a good thing, playing the part
acting the social killer bee

wait, hold on, before this goes any further
let's spill these drinks, and pour a new round of issues
you see, i like a girl with, oh,
a healthy lack in reality

i find it's best to find
perceptions easily molded
and for every three words you say
there's one word you never meant
let's see how many crimes we can commit
and later deny in the heat of the moment

i couldn't help but notice your style
how your eyes match your shirt,
match your lies-all see-through

i'm sorry baby i didn't mean to embarrass you
though i seem to have caught you red-handed
did you do this all on purpose?
it couldn't have been more perfect had you planned it

i can see the strength in you
oh, baby, you're miles ahead of the crowd
so strong, so independently attached 
to every guy you're around

so proud to make the choice
to rely on these plastic cups
what can i say, so do i
it's the closest i get to love

it's an advantage taken
for all the standard charms i lack
i'm sure it'd hurt a lot less
if i were the kind of guy who could take it back

i want to know how far i can take you
let you keep putting those words in my mouth
keep talking, keep making your own sense
the more, the better, all these words
to help me exaggerate in the end

'cause you're the one taking your clothes off
and i'm the one making friends."

my thoughts reach out
looking for a tuned ear
and any way i can make them
more real than synapses firing

i write these words back down
with rhythm, and heart
and let you read them
to burn them in your corneas

i'll paint a picture
of every dream i almost forgot
and let you see them

a tender embrace
everyday in the hall

and quiet nights
alone in your room
the warmth of a blanket
the smell of perfume

now days smack of pain
and lonely regrets
and tragedies from guilty missteps

so i'll cheat you with words

and build you a house
to give you a home

i'd hold you close

of faraway things

that you were safe
laying there, next to me

--

in days obsessed with some living death,
there's something she's not telling me
and i'm going out of my way to keep things inside...
but i'm not alone here

and for every sigh with any waking breath,
there's something you're not telling me

secrets don't make it any easier,
and lies don't make it any clearer
but, sometimes i feel something,
like i'm getting somewhere

give me words to believe
that i might have a place to be
give them words to scare
to scare the life from me

i'm on the outside,
just far enough away to be
something other than what you say
and when i find the strength,
there will be beauty in this place

like standing tall, for all the right reasons.

--

there's a peculiar depth to traditions kept
when this house breaks, and you're scared to fall.
i'll wait for you at the bottom, and when i'm done,
feel free to stay there.

--

your window blinds blur my perceptions
i know you're there, but not what you're doing with your time
your glowing eyes steal my affections
i know you're there, but not what you're doing with your mind

could i ever feel that warm again?

maybe.  ever.  never.  even.

and don't say you miss me, 'cause i know you're not thinking...
don't say you miss me, 'cause i know you're not thinking of me

well, i've been here before, and i'll be here awhile
just until someone will notice, 'cause that's just my style
i'm lost in the pronouns, 
between you and i, i'll never be at home here again."

a thousand 1st rate promises withering in dry, heavy hands. 
cause when the lights go down youll see the side of me youll never truly know.
a golden figure gleaming back from 1000 different eyes. 
and while you are with him at the end of the night 
ill dream a bigger dream.
i'm your one shot, your last round of gunmetal grey
riding iron wings of sizzling destiny to the sky and back.
and when I float in azure oblivion
you'll know
i dont need you anymore,
to be bigger than what you see.
You missed the ride of dreamly heroes for a prettier package."

The pristine knight, a fallen day star

Giants to windmills...

crashes down around a byronic hero...

a fountain of faith, hope and heart held back with metal and electricity
dangling on the edge of cold natured homicide
testing the springs, so clockwork, eyes adjusting to the dark 
""i was only trying to make it work!""
watching as it slowly clicks to a stop
diverted eyes, spilling over, wasted life running down your thighs...
too much to handle?
dead red in your golden strands.
 hear his last ""click click""

lead twice as many lives, while i wither inside.
wishing for anything to turn myself off, it'll be just like i'm gone - still giving everything to you.

can't lay these lips to rest 
until they know once more of your taste.
even then, they will live in the most shallow of graves

when they find out you've changed.

and they always whisper your name... always whisper your name, you can't escape.

i wanted to hear your voice, and you whispered poison into my ear.
i'm looking for it now, i have to find it and root it out.

but the deeper i look, i only see blood;
blood that doesn't even flow.
there's no oxygen, there's nothing left.
how's a parasite supposed to breathe?

your eyes said it was safe, and you put this inside me.
now i wander, aimlessly, to feed the hunger that consumed my soul.

It's been a long while since I last posted, since I last had the TIME to post.  Lots of different things to report, so I'll try to take it from the top...

JOB:  Still toiling away at my job as a framer.  We've been through 3 different sets of assistant managers and store managers in only 3 months.  Our DM Cindy is going through our shop today for the umpteenth time in an attempt to gather evidence that everyone working in the frame shop needs to be fired.  I hate her.  Also, the girl who keeps calling off is continuing her poor performance; I spend most of my time repairing her mistakes and attempting to pacify customers she has infuriated with her incompetance.  I'm missing deadlines all over the place.  Everything is normal...

DATING:  Not dating Alex anymore...I think the distance thing is what got us.  Not really trying to date right now; I'm just having fun sort of going out and relaxing as opposed to trying to meet people for the random hookup.  It's kind of nice.  My best friend from childhood, my own personal life-coach/guru told me about 2 weeks ago that he was in love with me; that he has been in love with me since we were kids and that his biggest regret was not getting me to go to Cinncinnatti with him for school.  I haven't known what to say to him since I feel like the ground has rolled out from underneath my feet.  And I just found out from a friend at work that yet another male friend might be harboring some feelings for me.  I AM OVER IT.  WHY CAN'T I HAVE PLATONIC FRIENDSHIPS WITH MEN WHO AREN'T GAY WITHOUT HAVING TO RISK THEM GETTING ALL WEIRD ON ME?!?  WHAT IS THE FUCKING DEAL WITH THAT SHIT?!?

Family:  My uncle just died after a prolonged sickness that no one knew about.  My mom is in shambles sorta, and the rest of my ridiculously animated family is ready to kill his half-wit widow for not telling anybody what had been going on.  The funeral is on Saturday but I don't think I'm going to go; my little brother G is in town and I think I'm taking him to the movies or something.

Friends:  There is just not enough time to talk about that shit.  The only thing I can say is that when people decide to not like you or be jealous or be petty, you can rest assured that they will stop at nothing to ensure your destruction.  Luckily, the bulk of my friends know me well enough to dismiss the terrible things that they hear about me from other folks.  I've been hanging out regular crew of miscrients, but I've also been expanding my horizons and hanging out with some new people.  It's been exciting and enjoyable to do new things.

That's about it.  G is by the computer now, asking me when we can go swimming or to the arcade or to COSI so I have to sign off.  I tried sending him outside during this enrty to ride his bike but he came back saying it was too hot outside.  Little wuss.  I'll bet anything that there was a wasp outside waiting for his little ass when he came out.

I do love that little boy..."

"event","A few months ago, my manager hired this guy that every female at my job under 60 wanted to bang.  We will call him ""J"".  J was sullen, built like a Greek god, and muy mysterioso; these things, of course, making him all the more attractive to most of us.  A few had reservations, however, about the true nature of J's sexuality, him being such a good dresser and somewhat crafty.  But I reserved judgment b/c you never know, y'know?

He'd been working at the store for about 2 months when he invited me to his house for a New Year's bash.  I thought nothing of it but apparently I was 1 of only 3 people at my job to be invited - turns out that made some folks a lil' jealous :)  At any rate, I went w/ my girls April and Jamye to the party but quickly knew I wasn't gonna stay; counting myself there were only 3 girls to an ever-growing crowd of rowdy, drunken frat boys.  I took a rain check on the evening and rang in the new year w/ my friends at a gay bar.  I wound up drunk dialing J later on that night, telling him about the guy friend I had that was PERFECT for him, realized what I had done the next day, and has said nary a word to him since except the occasional head nod and obligatory, ""Wassup?""  Normally I would be embarrassed at my inability to break the ice w/ J again, but my girl who stayed at the party on New Years had informed me that J was psychotic w/ a capital PSYCHO.  Not violent or anything, but massively disturbed enough to shut down most sexual impulses she had towards him.

Today, J does this cloak and dagger thing at work, telling me he needed to talk to me before I left for the day.  Oh crap, I thought, he's either going to come out to me or kill me for that drunk dial.  I nervously came up to him minutes before clocking out for the day and asked him what was up.  

Apparently, J has just moved out of his house and into an apartment w/ a new friend.  Only recently, after living w/ J for about a month, did this new friend disclose that he was gay.  J's response was, ""Okay,"" and kept going about his business.  But now there is a problem:  J's roommate might have a small thing for him.  Barely able to contain the swell of laughter inside of me I exhaled and asked him what he thought I could do about this.  It's simple, he says, just introduce his introverted roomie to one of my flaming pals so guy would get over J and move on to someone he DID have a snowball's chance in hell w/.  I told him that my friends were pretty good looking guys that're active and witty and whoever I hook them up w/ has got to be up to par.  I asked him what his roommate looked like and he hesitated, saying after a brief moment of contemplation that the guy was tall.  I told him that I'd figure out which of my friends are single but that I'd really have to see this roommate of his before I committed my friends to anything as disturbing as a blind date.  I asked J if he'd be opposed to perhaps meeting up w/ me and my friends at a gay bar so they could figure out for themselves who would go out w/ this guy.  J is thinking about it, but in the meantime, I'm calling in favors left and right to get some loser I don't know a date."

"event","WORK HAS BEEN KILLING ME!  AAAAARGH!

This girl who works @ my job - technically, she is my subordinate - has either called off or left work early for the past month; her inability to show up to work culminating last week w/her complete absence during an ad week for the store nationwide and an audit for just our location.  I was infuriated but was made to feel guilty about it by a handful of people I told the situation to in hopes that someone removed from the whole thing could lend me some perspective.  

The truth is that this girl is chronically ill, probably suffering from a condition a lot worse than what she is letting on.  She has numerous physical limitations that keep her from performing most of the basic tasks that her current position requires of her.  I suggested to my manager that maybe she be put on a register, to which Brandi replied that she is just going to have to have her hours cut dramatically since she cannot seem to do the job.  I was satisfied w/this.  Some people think I've been mean about the whole thing but honestly, I was kind compared to how I WANTED to react.  I wanted to scream at this girl that I have health problems, too:  Does she think it's easy for me to get to & from work everyday despite the fact that I can't drive due to a seizure disorder?  Do I ever call off or leave work early on a count of depression so severe I can hardly lift my head from the pillow?  How many times has she seen me stay at work battling migraines so bad that I have to excuse myself b/c my eyes are watering and people are beginning to see my facial tick?  How sick do I have to be before it is believed that I'm sick?

Mental illness is shitty b/c no one ever sees how bad it hurts until there is a chalk outline at the base of a sky scrapper - people don't pre-medicate, they just perform a post-mortem.  In order for most to see how deep the rabbit-hole of my despair can get, I have to draw blood...literally.  My loving, attentive parents waited until I had taken what appeared to be fistful after fistful of muscle relaxants before actually admitting me into a treatment facility.  I was so used to hurting myself that even my doctor doesn't trust me completely; he never gives me the full month's dosage of my sleeping pill all at once.  But I'm still here.  Not entirely aimless but sort of going about this business of living on a day-to-day basis.  I have a boyfriend that actually seems not to be bothered by the outrageous things I've done, friends that simultaneously keep me grounded AND allow me to fly off the handle when the situation calls for it, a group of troubled queer kids and their mentors who think I could be the Second Coming, and a mother who has done a yeoman's job of supporting me in almost all of my endeavors.  Lots have it worst than I, but also lots have it better.  There's not a day I don't struggle w/my lack of formal education, my tummy or my meds.  But I'm still here.  Working.  Playing.  Crying.  Thriving.  Depression be damned.

I don't want some misguided soul to think this post is supposed to be inspirational.  I still fuck up on a weekly basis, making decisions so bad you'd think I was drunk for 40% of them.  I have nothing that resembles credit, my hair is always a mess, and the only person who can't see my tremendous potential in this life is the loony bitch that's typing right now.  As harried and insane and defeating as existence on this stupid blue-green ball can be - and it is stupid, cruel, brutal, and short - I can't seem to shake this feeling that I'm not ready to leave just yet...

But, y'know...I could just be happy today..."

I love quoting.  There is a resonance in words those before us have arranged in such a way that we need only pick them up and dust them off to use them for ourselves.  There is wit to be found and solemnity to be gained reading the words of great men and women; there is a wisdom that our years or experiences haven't yet afforded us that makes THEIR words so full and lusty and undeniable."

"event","Work-related shit:  So far this week I've come in on 2 different days that I'd been scheduled off b/c my co-workers either forgot they were supposed to come in or they just plain called off.  I took Cheryl's 7-1/2 hrs. shift tonight b/c of whatever late-breaking family illness popped up an hr. before she had to come in.  When I got to work, I found a brand new scarf waiting for me where I place my apron; Brandi said it was a 'thank you' for being so great about coming in on my days off.  She seemed pretty happy, so I guess she didn't get written up when the district mgr did the audit on Wednesday.  I was kinda pissed, though, b/c I had to fill out the paperwork about my promotion again today; Allen apparently placed some of the information concerning when I started my job on the wrong line so Corporate told him to re-submit the form w/ everything in it's proper place.  Fucking bureaucratic assholes. 

Other shit:  Not really much to report.  I may have been wrong about that one guy, though.  I'm starting to think he may not be the one after all; I think I just wanted so badly to feel something - anything - that my mind had him built up to this level where he was no longer realistically attainable.  Sad.  I've just not really been into people - male or female - of late.  I still find certain folks attractive, but I'm just not in the mood to pursue anyone in particular.  Even the hotty-hot fetus @ work doesn't set my heart a-flutter like he used to.

Weirdness:  I had this dream the other night that my friend Brandon & I lived together in this fabulous apartment in Columbus.  I got home from work and started cooking dinner, followed shortly thereafter by Brandon.  We ate in our great room that was totally decked out with streamlined Swedish furnishings.  We continued this deep dinner conversation we had started as we cleaned up then went to our respective rooms.  Here's where everything starts to get really odd:  I, in my bathrobe and still talking, went into the bathroom to wash my face.  B-Don followed me in there, stripping as he walked.  He started some bathwater & when it was through, we both got into the tub & commenced to washing each other as we talked.  Then, we got out of the tub, dried off, had a quick kiss, and went to bed in our own rooms.

I told all this to Brandon, who said the dream was probably a product of our spending so much time together lately; the bath thing, he laughed, was just a take off of our more recent 'shower thing' :)"

"event","Drama:  2 of my bestest friends have been planning to move out together 4 nearly 2-1/2 yrs. now.  They've been steadily acquiring all the things they would need in order to make their move possible by the time my 1 friend graduates this year.  But the monkey wrench in their well-thought out plan is likely to become a 3rd friend, a girl who - though I love her & think she is a kick-ass person - is very flaky & fickle.  Her moods run hot & cold only, and she rarely volunteers to help pay for things...EVEN things she consumes and/or uses en masse.  Every Friday, I have 2 threaten 2 extract teeth from her just 2 get her 2 chip in 4 the endless supply of liquor I provide for my not-quite-legal compatriots.  And when she does kick in, it barely covers even the shit she specifically asks me 2 purchase; over the past few months alone, I've been shorted over $120 in the liquor tab.  2 b fair, though, it's not just been my 1 friend that has shorted me on the ever-growing tab; no 1 person pays more than I do for any of the stuff that we enjoy, but as long as they do things for me when I ask - small things like a run 2 the bank b4 we go out or a ride home from work if they happen 2 b out my way - then I don't care.  But my concern is 4 my 1st 2 friends & the eventual trouble of including my female pal in their apartment plans.  I can totally see her deciding after 3 months or less that she really doesn't want 2 live with either of them @ all & moving out suddenly, leaving my boys 2 pay her share of the rent 4 the duration of their lease agreement.  Ugh.  And 2 make matters worse, my friend who is graduating this year is pissed that the other 2 have been shopping 4 apt. stuff w/o him; they are making these joint purchases 4 shared spaces in the apt. that he doesn't like.  Makes no sense @ all.

Finally, the creator of the infamous soft porn video empire has turned the cameras on the depraved, college-aged meat-heads that bring him their parents' hard earned money.  I was watching Comedy Central the other night when - lo and behold - an ad flouncing drunken, oiled up, well-muscled young men was playing right in front of me.  The same cheesy narrator voiced over these hot guys running nude, taking showers and WRESTLING WITH ONE ANOTHER ON WHITE BEACHES.  I loved it.  I swear, I'm going to buy it.

Apparently someone must've told the porn mogul that produced the ""Girls Gone Wild"" video library that he was missing out on the straight girl and the gay dollar.  He will soon be richer than the Sultan of Brunei.  Bet.

Funniness:  I went to a UT SPECTRUM - a GLBTQ organization - meeting the other night and saw my friend Kerris Lee from high school; I have been seeing that girl everywhere over the past few weeks!  The meeting was nothing spectacular, except for the vice president of the group - she is this really hot latino-looking girl with a super punky pixie-do.  We wound up going on the night SPECTRUM decided to have a viewing of RENT, newly released on DVD.

I was supposed to meet this girl last Friday but wound up getting stood up which, as it turned out, was a good thing b/c my friend & his boyfriend got into this thing about 1 of them being to clingy and it became this huge stain nearly ending in somebody trying to drive home drunk.  Thankfully everyone's keys were put in places where they would NEVER think to look 4 them so no 1 left until the next morning when only gut hangovers survived.  I'm so grateful I haven't been drunk 4 the past couple of weeks during my little outings; I think that I've been a lot smarter about some of the things I've chosen to do; or, in my case, what I have recently chosen not to do.

Girls are stupid.  Boys are the same.  I'm giving up sex forever.  Making out is still okay, though.

The day after all the boyfriend brouhaha, Luke and I went to this really cute Indian restaurant to have lunch and a killer masala tea.  I really enjoy spending time with him.  And I don't say this often about people b/c I think each person really has to find their own niche in this life, but Luke needs to be in college.  He's so fucking smart and funny and engaging and clever and creative...the world would benefit from having some1 like him as a teacher.  He could do anything he wants, but I fear most of the time that he's going to be like me, take too long a break in continuing his education, and fall tragically short of becoming the person he could be.  I don't want that for him.  Luke is too amazing a person to have that happen to him.

I wasn't slighting myself in that last bit.  I just try to admit to truth when I see it.

Still looking for an apartment.  As it turns out, that is the one good thing about today:  The former district manager of my store sort of prematurely said that our location would be moving to an area closer to where I currently live and thus outside the TATRA reach.  Apparently, we aren't slated to go anywhere 4 a while, so moving into a place down the street - once again - is a smart move. I just want this whole thing to be over already.  I'm ordering these things from Ikea b/c it's cute, cheap, and I'm a do-it-yourself kind of bitch.  That's right.  I'M the dyke your mother warned you about."

I'm staring @ my poor excuse of a paycheck and trying to decide what to do with it.  I'm thinking I better pay my ridiculous phone bill since I am almost 99.99% sure that it will be horrendous this month due to an unforseen and *cough* excessive increase in the # of text messages I've both recieved & sent.   I'm not even gonna look @ the bill when it comes in.  I'm just going to pay w/ a credit card once I get home and deposit my check into my account tomorrow afternoon during my lunch.

God.  I apologize for that droll bit of the mundane.  It's not glamorous or exciting, but it's life, so what are you going to do about it?

At any rate, I went to RAY on Wednesday for the fist time in a little over a month.  I really missed Brenda, Tamara, and Ward.  Brenda is so-o-o-o the mother I would have loved to have coming up; she tells people the things they need to hear and gives them the advice that could save them from a lifetime of heartache but manages to do both in a way that is not preachy or domineering.  And if you choose to ignore her well-dispensed wisdom and things turn out horribly, she doesn't lord it over you or make you feel like shit for not taking it; instead, she gently helps you get back on track, leaving your mistakes exactly where you left them - in the past.  Yep.  She's a queer kid's dream parent.

In other news:  My friends are suggesting we take another early Fall/late Summer trip together but are still divided as to where to go.  A few people have suggested Cabo San Lucas, the party spot for the rich and famous to wit I say, ""I am neither rich nor famous.""  Honestly, I wouldn't mind going to Cabo if I thought every1 could afford it, but since $540 + incidentals is more than many can ante up, Cabo is out of the question.  I AM partial, however to Atlanta or San Francisco.  Atlanta has this part of town called Little 5 Points that is like a little gay city inside of a city.  And then there is San Francisco.  Enough said.  I thought it also might be nice to drive down to Chicago & catch the Gay Games in May.  Ward is running in the marathon and it might be fun to catch up Katrina and Rachel.

Did any1 other than myself watch the State of the Union Address earlier this evening and feel like a giant target was painted on their backs?  Cutting through 51 tedious minutes of Dubya's 4th grade speaking I was able to whittle down his address to the nation to the following highlights:
     - his endorsement of a constitutional ban on late-term abortions & the creation of a law
         that would require that minors seeking abortions MUST recieve parental consent
     - his condemnation of *gay marriage & his proposal of a constitutional amendment banning it
         (*tonight he called equal rights a ""liberal interpretation of the law"")
     - the continuation of his ass-backwards crusade in Iraq, despite losses we've sustained and the 
         fact that he STILL can't manage to find a 6 ft. tall Afghani hooked up to a dialysis machine
     - his Helen Keller-like assertion that, despite what we see & hear, the U.S. economy is doing
         well and getting better
     - his unwavering belief that we should not question, doubt, or even second-guess what his 
         administration is doing...at all...in ANY arena.  It's unpatriotic.

WHAT THE FUCK?!? Is he stoned?  Are people in this country so scared of the supposed terrorist threat that they are willing to stand by silently as their rights are taken from them?  Are we supposed to just sit back and relax while they punish us for holding dissenting opinions?  This is AMERICA, for fuck's sake!  I have an inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; not restricted liberties.  

I wonder if the assholes who voted for Bush in '04 - if any1 reading this voted for him, and I doubt that b/c HIS kind of people don't read, yes, I do mean to be offensive.  I am deeply offended myself that you would vote for such a weasel - realized that that silver spoon-fed oil slickster was going to be in the postion to put 2 Supremes on the bench.  With O'Connor and Renqhist gone, all fairness has left.  Mark my words, it will be only a matter of months before Roe v. Wade is thrown out.  During his speech, as Bush attempted to raise his floundering approval rating, he did as his predecessors had done and began rattling off various statistics supporting the decline of violent crimes; as if no 1 would notice, he listed the recent decline in the U.S. abortion rate right in between murders and kiddie rape.  That he would even do that on national television should scare the shit out of every1.

On the funnier side, here are some issues King George II spent hardly a paragraph on:
     - the overwhelming failure of ALL gov't agencies in regards to Hurricane Katrina & her victims

"event","Hey!!

Just wanted to say that I was still alive.  Busy, but alive nonetheless.

I put myself on one of those practice budget thingies in order to get a gage on how much monthly expenses are gonna cost me when I get my own place.  So far this week, I've spent around $40 on transportation, $30 on food, $20 on medication - thanks insurance company - and $20 on miscellaneous goods.  $110 this week and it's not even Wednesday.  Of course, the transportation cost will go down dramatically when I move back into Toledo city limits thanks to the Iron Pimp a.k.a. TARTA.  The only apartment complexes I'm looking @ are on TARTA lines that will take me directly to and from work.

Why I felt like shit all last week:  I caught the Black Death and some of my friends forgot my birthday.  I know I'm older and that kind of stuff shouldn't bother me but it does.  I was hurt and I didn't really feel like interacting with them for the rest of the week.  Was that childish?  For THEIR birthdays, all of my friends got extravagent gifts or expensive liquor or a one-of-a-kind bash from me b/c I enjoy seeing them happy, since they are ususally the SOURCE of my happiness.  But I got nothing from some of them.  Okay.  2 of my dear friends took me to dinner and 2 others gave me singles to throw @ strippers, but the others did bupkiss.  I got a shit present from my mother, my father fuckng forgot, and don't even get me started on my deadbeat sisters and brothers.  All in all, it was a really crappy time for me and I'm relieved that the heaviest part of it is over.

Work is hell.  Our District Manager and the 2nd-in-Command of the company is scheduled for a walk-through sometime this week.  Yipee.  Everyone is running around like chickens w/ theor heads cut off and I am expected to do the same or risk getting fired.

Bright spot:  On Monday, my friend April told me that my breasts were looking particularly perky and full. 

That girl sure has a way w/ words."

"event","Has anyone other than myself been getting into ""The Boondocks"" t.v. show?

It - of course - is based on artist Aaron McGruder's nationally-syndicated comic strip about 2 brothers who move from the ghetto to the suburbs w/ their old-school grandfather.  Huey is an intelligent and militant lil' brother, while Riley - who is also intelligent - is a stone nigga.  Grandad is what could be referred to as ""Black Folk,"" a proud Black man who just wants to live in the peaceful calm of suburbia after a lifetime of toil.  

The thing that makes the show so funny is that McGruder offers a satirical bend on the state of affairs in Black America.  Even upwardly mobile Blacks have to deal with either ignorant White folks or ig'nant niggas on an everyday basis; the trick is to be able to laugh about it later.

Bonus:  While watching ""The Boondocks,"" it is o.k. to laugh @ gratuitous use of the n word."

"event","I can't trust my feelings anymore and that really sucks...hard.  I get up, go to work for 8 to 9 hrs., come home, eat, go to sleep, and start the whole thing over again.  Occaisionally, I will visit with friends and have coffee and pointless discussion that resolves nothing but is calming so it is nice.  But then it is back to the same old shit.  I feel...something...but what it is, I don't know.  Words like 'boredom', 'apathy', and 'want' hang in the air overhead, but none of them are settling around me long enough for me to get a clear picture of what they are really like.  

Oh yeah.  I'm looking for an apartment in South Toledo, hopefully somewhere that is - at least in the summer and spring months - within walking distance from where I work.  I've got a few thousand dollars saved up, and considering what I make at my job, I figure I should be able to get a decent 1 bedroom for somewhere in the neighborhood of $310-$425 a month.  I am desperately trying to arrange to move by the end of January; sort of my birthday gift from myself to myself.

Funny thing:  My friend Carl's mother is a combination of Gollum, Harvey Feinstein, and every Jewish mother stereotype you can think of.  She is somewhat paranoid most of the time and drinks martinis like they're water; all of this making her 1 of the most entertaining people ever to me.  Carl, on the other hand, is an uber-elite hipster god who is Jewish by blood, not practice.  
We all knew that RAY was having a *white elephant party, so Carl started looking around his house for something he could wrap and give as a gift.  He took some curio of his mother's and barricaded himself in his room.  By the time I got to his house, his stepdad, sister, and mother were banging on his door demanding that he come out and surrender the object.  As soon as he heard my voice, he shouted, ""Shannon, RUN!"" and proceeded to nearly knock me down as he ran out the door, off his porch, and into the streets of Rossford.  Huffing and puffing right behind him was his mother, calling him all kinds of S.O.B.'s and motherfuckers.  Panting, she approached me and ordered me to tell her what it was he took; she told me to call her as soon as I figured it out.

Hands down, that was the funniest chase I've ever seen.  Ever.

"event","You meet someone.  Immediately - or several minutes into the initial meeting if you're dense like me - you realize that you are physically attracted to this person.  Your mind starts racing; you're playing out little sexual scenarios in your head.  This is okay, you reason with yourself, I don't know him/her so treating them like an object of lust in my mind is a perfectly natural thing to do.  All you are doing is admiring their form; not pure gorgeosity in the flesh but the kind of pretty that makes you say aloud, ""Maybe.""  Then something happens.  This attractive someone says something that snaps you out of your dreamlike state and causes you to pause for a moment; this amazing something they've just said makes you start to suspect that there is more to this person than meets the eye.  Right away, you decide you want to know - not just them, but you want to know why they are who they are and what other little wonders are lurking inside of them.

You spend time with them often, chatting them up on the phone mostly because you can't believe how lucky you are to find someone who likes Anthony Burgess books and hates pilgrims as much as you do.  Over hundreds of emails and millions of cups of coffee, you get comfortable.  This person knows you.  You know them.  You've said things to them that you'd NEVER say to anyone else and you feel happy letting them know that.  Both of you have the unflagging happiness that is being gotten by someone.  You are close.

Here's where the twist comes...

One morning, you get up excited, knowing that today will bring this person to you.  You smile and smile until you pass a mirror and realize the intensity of it all.  You are glowing.  This person makes you glow.  You never miss anything.  You miss this person before they leave the room.  You've never known l***.  This person makes you want to prove that l*** can save all conquer all BE all.

Once you realize how you feel, you hurry to meet this person because once you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to begin as soon as possible.  So you race to meet them.  And when you reach them, they have a surprise for you; they've just met the man/woman of their dreams and, oh, aren't you happy for them.

Fuck, you scream inside.  This is not because you hate this new person - even though you might think you do - but rather because you begin to understand that you were not in the Partner Training Program like you thought; you were all the while segueing into the Friendship Zone.  A place from whence no one ever returns.  A place void of physicality.  A place LACKING.  A place as permanent as death because no matter how much it hurts to hear your one-and-only talk about and to this new person, you know it will hurt more if you cut them out completely.  They have become the beautiful 7 lbs. malignant tumor pressing on the pleasure centers of your brain - it hurts so good.

Ever find yourself the ""friend"" of someone you adore?  Ever felt compelled to shake the shit out of them and scream that you are the one that they have been looking for?  I feel like screaming all the time..."

"event","I desperately hope that the 1 person that will get the following code-speak will read this...

I'm still sprung on ERROL FLYNN. He remains this unobtainable, this perfect, this all-encompassing crush that won't go away.  GEORGE CARLIN is the closest thing to the total package I've ever met, and could quite possibly BE the total package if I got to know him better.  He stimulates me beyond that which most people do and I cannot for the life of me understand how.  I've barely ever touched him - a slight brush on his shoulder, a preliminary handshake - and I can't get his skin out of my mind.  The way it felt on mine must be the way Egyptian cotton feels the first time you lay down on it.

That sounds silly, doesn't it?  But that doesn't make it any less true.  I save everything that reminds me of BOB SAGET - another stupid thing to fill up hours.  Funny things I see or hear, I write it down so I can tell VIGGO MORTENSON later and he will know that i think of him often and deeply.  But mostly I don't tell him these witty/pretty/sad things b/c the thought of HONESTLY letting him know that he is on my mind is scary.  Rejection terrifies me to the point where most of my relationships never extend beyond that basic level of friendship.  The vulnerability of being so open with my feelings and the chance that they might not be reciprocated is almost too much for me to bear.  

I don't understand how someone as intelligent as I am can be so damn stupid about how to do this 1 thing as simple as saying, ""I like you.""  How the FUCK did I manage getting out of kindergarten w/o mastering use of this 1 piece of social currency?!?  I feel like I want to shout from the rooftops or break out into a musical number unexpectedly, but I do not and I hate myself for it.  GIOVANNI RIBISI deserves songs and great choreography.  Hell.  COREY FELDMAN deserves a girl who can at least tell him how she feels about him.  I tell him how I feel about everything from unimportant to very important but the most important can't seem to make it's way out of my mouth.  I'm unimpressed w/ myself right now and just a little bit pissed off.  

I mess around with people I don't care about and never could.  I make out with people I consider friends all the time and never think about it twice.  I hang all over folks whenever I first meet them.  But the idea of even breathing the same air as PAUL ROBESON seems like a defilement; like  he's some pristine version of myself I want to keep pure as long as humanly possible.  And I'm sure KANYE WEST would hate to know that I've put him on this ever-rising pedestal, but I can't help it.  I've been trying really hard to mentally deconstruct ROBERT De NIRO - to lessen what and how often I think about him - and I suck at it.  

I'm a depressed agoraphobe w/ a tendency to be verbose and emotionally-stunted.  I am NOT at a place where I can offer anyone anything other than the promise that I can be faithful and funny and loving in the extreme.  Shit.  I said a word with 'love' in it.  I'm officially done with this entry now."

Now I have to go shopping for new black boots tomorrow on top of getting a small present for David - his birthday is today and we're all going down to Columbus to surprise him - and depositing my paycheck.

Yesterday, I acted like such a shit to my friends.  It wasn't their fault I was having a mentally crappy day, and I was snapping at them like they'd just turned off my heat in the dead of winter.  After a thrilling RAY meeting on the topic of ""Self-Esteem"" - none of us have any, you know - and we were headed over to Shayne's, Bobby kind of asked me what was going on b/c I'd been acting irritated all night.  I told him I thought I was just slipping into 1 of my depressive states - or out of 1 - and that I was just going to be irritable for a little while.  He looked at me in a sort of examining way, gave up, then turned his focus back on driving.  Bless Bobby's heart; he has no idea the depths my craziness can reach or the things it can compel me to do, but rather than attempt to understand half-heartedly, he just accepted it and offered himself for listening.

Dan and Don stopped by at the beginning of RAY tonight to introduce their new son to us.  Little Gustin Tate was the most beautiful baby boy I've seen since my little brother; he has strong hands, a perfectly round face - the product of a C section as opposed to a vaginal birth - and a darling smattering of wavy, black hair.  He yawned, smiled, fretted, and stole everyone's heart.  I love him, if for no other reason than he is Dan's son and I love Dan.  He even smelled good.  I can't wait for Dan or Don to call me over to babysit Gus-Gus; we will have the best of times together.

Also, I have been talking to this guy on my xanga - as I've said before, I am addicted to starting these little online journal thingies - that I went to high school with.  His name is Chris and when we went to school together, I always kind of thought he was cute but non-approachable; he seemed to walk around with this sort of air about him that made him seem arrogant and self-important.  After talking with him for a while, I've come to realize that ""air"" was really more one of deep reflection and self-loathing, which, if you know anything about me, is like Spanish Fly to me.  So, of course, I've been trying to be flirtatious with my posts, and to my surprise, he actually responded by being kind of flirtatious in return.

Now comes the hard part:  He wants to see me, just to hang out with him sometime or maybe do something else.  I want to see him, too.  How do I do it?  What am I supposed to say?  I never say the right thing to guys/girls that I really like or could really like and I don't want to fuck this up in case it turns into something more.

This is an awesome book for people who work with kids and/or teens, former self-injurers, or their loved ones.

Instead, it weighs every option and offers what advice the current research and specialists can give that has been effective in treating this condition.

People kept talking about how fun it would be to jump in the pool, so a few of us undressed poolside and dove in.  I had so much fun!

Bad joke:  Father Flannagan was teaching his sixth grade class all about the wonders of God's miracles.  George, the troublemaker of the group, kept distracting the other students until he decided to interrupt the priest by loudly asking, ""What IS a miracle, anyways?""
""Well,"" said Father Flannagan, ""The best way to explain is to show you.  Would you please come here?""  So George left his desk and walked to the front of the classroom.  When he got up there, Father Flannagan instructed him to bend over.  George did, and Father Flannagan proceeded to give him a tremendous kick between the legs, which made the boy fall to the floor, howling in pain.
""Now, George, did you feel that?"" Father Flannagan asked.
""Of course I did!"" whimpered George.
""If you hadn't,"" Father replied, ""That would've been a miracle.""

You'd expect your parents or other relatives to love you inside out and unconditionally, but those are the ones most folks - myself included - are constantly trying to gain the attention of; the ones most folks just want to accept and love them, no questions asked.  My friends don't have to understand me to love me, nor I them, but we still manage somehow to support and show our affection for one another.

The following joke is in very poor taste.  I apologize now.  All the actual jokes I know are either dirty or Catholic in nature.  Not my fault!  Blame St. Mary's, St. Alphonsus, St. Stephen's, Corpus Christi, Central Catholic H.S., and St. Martin dePorres for my education in foul humor.

A wealthy man visits a small Catholic church for the first time and hears the priest deliver a very eloquent sermon.  After the mass the man shakes the priest's hand and says, ""Father, that was one goddamn great sermon.""
""Thank you,"" says the priest, ""But it would be appreciated if you didn't use such language to express yourself.""
""I just can't help it, Father.  It was just so goddamn good I wrote you a check for a thousand dollars.""
The priest says, ""No shit!""

Sorry, folks, if you didn't get the last entry.  It was sorta directed at one person in parts, but the bulk of it was decipherable.  Wasn't it?  Eh.  Fuck it...

As you can probably guess, at least one computer in my house is now operable; I'm still waiting for my friend to pull through with the repair job on my laptop so that I can get wi-fi on the motherfucker.  The plan is to sit in some boho coffee spot, smoking, drinking chai, and looking incredibly fucking indie.  I've already got the super-smarty glasses - a lovely pair of grey Vogues that was sort of my consolation after my eye doc told me my vision was terrible - and the earthy, natural hair.  I am only a functioning laptop and a Decemberists song away from being my own independent film short.

I'm not working this weekend and will use this time off as an opportunity to get some well deserved sleep.  I've been screwing up so much lately at work that I fear repercussions; if I get written up one more time, I could, in effect, be fired.  And I am really not in the mood to start looking for another job right now.  I'm getting my schooling stuff straight so that I can start taking a few classes in January at UT, and a friend of the family is going to get me started with getting myself licensed as a bartender.

I think I'd make an excellent bartender.  I'm smart, cute, funny, and strong; I won't mind kicking drunk ass if it bothers me any.

I hate the way some people make me feel.  Most people have either a settling or unsettling air about them; a sort of fog that will make you gag or make you feel at ease.  With most people, you can tell straight off if they are going to be good to you and for you, even if ""straight off"" ends up translating into ""a few weeks.""  Most people.  But then again SOME people aren't MOST people and CERTAIN people aren't even SOME people most of the time.  Sometimes CERTAIN people won't do because all I ever wanted/needed/craved is that ONE person who makes all the MOSTs, SOMEs, and CERTAINs look like NOTHINGs.  That one, that only one, makes me feel blessed/cursed.  I'm never quite sure if the butterflies in my stomach are nervous delight when I'm talking to him or utter dread at the thought that I've just said something wholly dimwitted and he NOW thinks I am a loser.  I've never known someone who makes me feel so at home in my skin but still manages to make me wish I were better; that I were a little more like the ""me"" they know me to be.  

HAL SPARKS is the most beautiful person I have ever encountered anywhere.  He makes me laugh genuinely - which is a feat - and he makes me scratch my head, which is nice 'cause it really needed scratching.  Let me clarify ""beautiful"":  Intelligent, articulate, darling.  See also entertaining, humorous, sadistic.  Oh, and I guess he's physically attractive, too.  I think when folks say things like they'd like to date someone with a personality and someone who is smart, they are just trained to say those things.  Oddly enough, they are actually trained by this Western Culture-machine - a machine, mind you that teaches us to despise they way we came into the world and urges us at every turn to take the quick fix to correct Mother Nature's mistakes - to sentimentalize these heart-of-gold qualities, all the while believing that if any of it were true, should anyone ACTUALLY go looking for this ideal person, EVERYONE would be shit out of luck. If that sounded like a mini tirade blasting the culture we all know and love, it was.  I am angry as hell at the ideal.  I actually want it so bad, that I HAVE waived the physical at times.  I hate my arms and I have a thing for nerds.  How fucked up is that?

At any rate, I'm sitting here and all I can think about is COLIN FERRELL.  It's childish, really.  I mean, I'm doing something, a random event occurs, and I smile because I know that ABE VIGODA would've laughed his ass off if he'd been there.  Or other such nonsensical things I chastise myself for wondering during the day.  I think I should feel ashamed for thinking about him so much; for letting my ""like"" for him take up so much of my time.  I think I should feel ashamed of going on and on on this damn livejournal about this guy as if I were in 7th grade; for not being my publicly-known pessimistic self when I talk to him.  For everything I'm about to say and everything I already did.  

I'm usually the Great Wall of China.  I am Tupperware.  Nothing can break or penetrate me.  I'm as safe as a virgin in a eunuch colony.  But I wasn't built for this type of infiltration.  I do not have the parts necessary to deal with this sort of surprise invasion, this attack on my emotions.  I am ill-equipped.  I am scared shitless.

Only thing to report is that I got my first hangover this weekend.  Usually, I'm not a big advocate of self-medication or drinking with the intent purpose of getting drunk, but I was partying pretty hardcore to sort of makeup for the weeks of neglect my friends suffered at my hand.  However, my plan to bond with each of them individually over shots sort of tanked and ended up with me exposing my top half to the whole club and passing out before I was completely undressed.  When I woke up Saturday morning, all I had to show for the night before was an empty wallet - all my singles had gone to the drag queens performing that night - an empty stomach, a killer headache, and a free pass back to the club.  

I don't think I'll be going out for a while.  I'm thinking about brushing up my scrapbooking skills.

I made the coolest purchase last week @ Media Play.  They were selling all these action figures from different movies, Iand I had been told by my boss that they had Jay and Silent Bob dolls.  Anyone that knows me knows that I am a devout disciple of Kevin Smith and all things Jay and Silent Bob, so I went to the store in order to buy as many of them as I could.  However when I got there, the only View Askew figures they had were the chicks from ""J & S.B. Strike Back"" and Officer Willenholly.  I despaired all of about 10 seconds when out of the corner of my eye I saw it.  A Patrick Bateman action figure from ""American Psycho"", complete with walkman, weapons, and dirty videotape.  I bought 2; one for me and one for my boss.  Right now I'm trying to figure out the best way to frame it so it can be on display.  Joy.


Joke:  A woman is about to be stoned for the crime of adultery.  As an angry mob starts to surround her, Jesus leaps in and puts himself between they and the woman.  Prolifically, Jesus says in a commanding voice, ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.""  From way in the back, a single rock sails overhead.
  Jesus looked into the crowd and swore, ""Dammit, Mother!  Is that you?"""

Nothing is really going on right now, except for the fact that this guy at my job quit and now I have to pick up a shitload of hours so that my frame shop doesn't get ALL of it's hours cut entirely.  Gin-breathed, sexually-harassing, rotten-toothed fuckrag.  He quit in the middle of a huge ad week for my store and hasn't been back since he called in to resign 2 weeks ago.

My mother has officially gone insane.  I've been staying with my sister for the past week or more.  She's been easily riled since my granny passed on a month ago; she is suspicious of everybody and everything. B/c of that, I haven't been out clubbing in a while.  It may not seem like the perfect activity for someone who is as agora- and tactophobic as I can be sometimes, but dancing is so completely freeing and intimate and exhausting; you can't feel angry or depressed after a night of hard dancing with nothing but Red Bull and vodka shots to fuel you.  You just feel tired and slightly buzzed.

I kind of like this girlfriend of mine, but I have no idea if she's interested in me or not.  We kissed a while back sort of on a lark and I liked it; so did she.  We've lately been entertaining the idea of moving in together sometime this fall, since she will be in school and I will behead someone if I don't leave my home soon.  But this liking her thing needs to get in check before I decide anything once and for all.

Poem:  If I Stopped Loving You

If I stopped loving you
The world would stop spinning
Stop dead in it's orbit and just fall
Straight into nothing
With the seas overhead
The ground beneath us would drop out
And we would just be hanging
Hanging in the nothing
Suspended in time we would be
Without me...loving you...

If I stopped loving you
Nations would crumble
Pure, unadulterated crazy would pour form the earth
Like blood from a wound
Wars to be fought Monday thru Friday
Cleanup Saturday; church on Sunday
Leaders lost in   wise men baffled by
This level of confusion
This chaos I created
By simply not loving you...

If I stopped loving you
No one would dream anymore
No more silvery wings on dancer's backs
Carrying you up and above no more
Queer, pretty things
Bearing you gently over miles of
Milk and honey fields
Slowly until forever seems as long as a night 
In my waiting arms
Gone...without my love...

If I stopped loving you
You would become invisible to all
You would simply cease to be
That radiance you own
That way the sun kisses your wonderful self
Your soulful tenor and splendid form
The way you wear confusion 
Likea a badge of honor
All these seen   now made unseen
Without my love...none of it would be...

If I stopped loving you
Even for a moment
All these things would come true
Even if it was only for me
Because for everything else
That you are
You are simply  everything
And I am  my love of everything
So, yes, Everything, NOTHING would be
Forver without me...loving you.

More bad news.  My grandmother died 2 days ago and I've been grieving out of my mind.  I don't get it.  I knew she was dying.  She had what was to be her 3rd and final stroke over 2 weeks ago.  She was 92.  And yet, despite all of these things, I still was shocked when I got the news.  How is that?  What did I not do to adequetely prepare myself for what was coming fast and hard?  What happened between the realization that she was GOING to die and the actual event of her death that would make me catatonic for almost 2 hours after my mother gave me this news?  Why am I hurting so much?  And why the fuck can't I collect my thoughts enough to perform basic functions like going to work and getting things straight at home?  Times like these, I wish I had unwavering faith in 1 religion or another, that way I'd be certain that things are as they should be, could be no different and are thereby for the best.  Candide's Dr. Pangloss was right...

Upside:  Saturday night, Mark Baby-luv, Shayne, Amber, Gay David, and I went out for comfort, consolation, and drink.  I self-medicated til I was in a crazed stupor and wound up talking to some guy who had the audacity of acting like an alpha-male in a gay bar.  Here was this specimen of black manhood - something my brown eyes haven't laid eyes on for quite some time - and I couldn't help thinking, ""Baby, why are YOU here?""  I knew his cousin, a bisexual club hopper like myself, and decided to ask his cousin's...um...tastes.  ""Same as mine"" was the response I got.  But this guy was going out of his way to prove his hetero-ness, so to speak.  Like he wa ashamed or embarassed that a girl that he might like to start a relationship with had ""caught"" him in a gay bar.  HELLO!?!  I was at a gay bar to and his level of uncomfortability was dizzying.

"event","I desperately need to go back to school...

I've been out for nearly 2 years now and I think my brain is starting to soften:  Today, I actually watched an entire episode of Maury without laughing at the genetic mishaps that passed for guests.  Thoroughly freaked out, I hurried up and read 30 pages from Elie Wiesel's ""Night"" - somehow I thought reading about the horrors of the Holocaust would be suitable punishment for not turning off the television during talk-t.v. time.  I've tried to stay busy all day to avoid sinking in front of the couch but the abomination keeps pulling me back in.  Damned micro-suede...

Back to the school thing.  I really do need to go back, but I hardly know which obstacle to tackle first.  I barely had any kind of grades in high school b/c I was convinced that art schools do not look at things like that when reviewing applicants.  I was right but that still didn't count for shit when I tried EMU for a year, which, by the way, was one of the worst decisions ever made.  And after my little date rape encounter with Grabby McBastard, a.k.a. The Guy Who Got Away With It, my grades at Eastern- not to mention my sanity - went downhill.  Even once I got to art school, my ever-so-precarious mental state took a turn south and I ended up back home.  I've been so entirely spooked by the college experience that I haven't dared look back in an effort to rethink my decision to leave until recent months.  But I am thinking about it again and I'm starting to think I really need to go back a.s.a.p.

I want to work at a drop-in center for queer teens and twentsomethings; I want to help with counseling, tutoring, mentoring, and community activism.  I want to be a voice for the LGBTQ community, and to do that, I will need to suck up whatever self-doubt I might have and just start over in college.  I still have the need in me...that infernal need to keep consuming new information and ideas until I am bursting with so much knowledge and wisdom that I can't help but get a little on passersby.  I genuinely love to learn.  Finding out something new, for me, is more satisfying than a 4-star 7 course meal.  I get as close to nirvana as I'm ever going to get when someone tells me something new, and the possibility of me making a career out of passing on that newly found data is...fulfilling.

Maybe the reason I've been so hesitant with making the decision to go back to school is because, in part, I tend to sabotage myself when I have the opportunity to be truly contented and happy even.  I do it in relationships all of the time; it would only make sense that my self-nullifying behavior would segue into other parts of my life as well.  What do I have against allowing myself to be completely happy?  What could be the driving force behind my inability to go after that which I truly want?

I'm going to shut up now.  I was having a fairly decent day and I don't like where this semi-negative train of babble is going.  I will start school by January.  I will get an apartment with Amber.  I will call that hottie from the club and see if we can't hook up sometime this weekend.  Shit. I just remembered that her art show is Saturday which is the day of Bobby's open house which is the day RAY is supposed to march in the Old West End Parade.  Shit.  Being an activist for queer rights is going to be a lot harder than I thought, but I'm getting there.

And on that note, I had 1 of the best weekends ever!  I went to the gay bar w/ friends to celebrate my little Carlito's b-day and had a smashing time.  I even met this girl who is so cute and blonde that I decided to call her the Sprightly Elfin Femme for most of the night...I like blondes...hee hee...

This is the second time I've gone to that particular club in 2 weeks and met someone.  The weird part is that I have never considered myself a club kid; I go to that bar because 1)they've got the best music in town, 2)they don't water down drinks, 3)there is a drag performance every Friday night that is to die for, 4) I love dancing, and 5)I like being able to dance all night without being groped or hit on by every guy that THINKS I'm looking at him.  Meeting people is just a perk.  The other thing that has got me waiting for the ground to fall away underneath me is that I have been single for so freakishly long - please don't inquire how long, there aren't enough numbers to express that amount of time - that I am surprised that I even know how to interact with people on that level.  

I am BEYOND guarded with my feelings.  The sheer thought of loss or betrayal at the hands of someone I have come to l*** - I consider that a 4-letter word - is unfathomable.  I'd be so crushed that I'd likely become the crazy cat-lady that lives at the end of some dead-end street in a garish, black mold-ridden house that reeks of heartache and cat pee.  And I don't like cats or their urine, so I choose rather to be super-selective now when it comes to letting people into my world.  My world is a seething quagmire, and thar be things swimmin' in it...

   So it's 1:00 a.m. and I can't sleep.  You know that feeling like when you're going about a million miles a minute, your senses are sharpened, and you know that even if you manage to lie still enough in your bed you will not be drifting to the Land of Nod for at least 4 more hours?  That's what I'm experiencing right now; thanks to a combination of night terrors and Paxil.  
   On the real, I feel like I could go on moving until the second coming of Christ or until Elizabeth Berkley wins an Oscar, whatever comes first.  I don't know why I feel so awake.  I worked from 8:30 til 6:00 today and could've sworn that I yawned no less than 2 hrs. ago.  I ate heavy food once I came home, watched Jeopardy, and vegged out for about 3-1/2 hrs. after that.  I don't like moving much...
   I guess I felt pretty odd today.  For about 2 months, I've been in this funk that has been all but impossible to shake.  I drag all day at work, get home, and plop myself in front of the television until it's time to go to bed or take a piss break or eat.  I fall asleep and dream nothing.  I awake the next morning, take a shower, get dressed, go to work, then start the whole fucking cycle again.  If it weren't for the mindlessly numbing effect that my mundane-but-well-paying job has on me, I'd surely be in some white room with rubber walls by now.  But I guess that's my thing, my problem.  Other than a few minor things, I'm really not in a postion to complain; I do have a job that I enjoy more and more everyday, I have a group of friends that are surprisingly supportive and accepting, and I am self-sustained - which is a nice way of saying that I am painfully single - so what is it? 
   Nothing.  It's the nothing that is driving me up the fucking wall and it is the nothing that feels like a thousand pound anvil around my neck, threatening to cut off my air supply at any time.  This awful, impassable nothing is so intense and ugly and all-consuming that I can't even get a clear picture of it.  My first snapshot sort of looked like a mild depression with just a hint of ambivalence.  My second resembled a picture of a Texas road, cracked and dry, with tumbleweed blowing through the path; I had painted such a picture when, during a EMU campus run of ""The Vagina Monologues"", someone had suggested that all the women in the production draw a picture of their own vagina (a tear is rolling down my cheek now).  The third image I made out of the nothing was a man.  I'm not 100% sure of who he is, but I know that I know him.  I mean, he eminates the sort of feeling old friends or forgotten enemies give off, which is really frustratung because I desperately want to know if he is a friend or a foe.  
   For all of you Freudophiles out there, no, the man in my dreams is not representative of my absentee or neglegent father.  Rather to the contrary, my father is extraordinarily loving and has been one of the only constants in my life.  But this guy, whoever the hell he is, is always sort of out reach, like he doesn't want me to see him at all.  And since he has started - since the nothing has started - to permeate through to nearly every facet of my humdrum existence, I still can't figure out why.  After all these years of sort of standing around in my dreams, why has this now become such an issue?  Why would this Nothing Man be in every clear memory of childhood?  But most important of all, why would he be present in periods I can't even seem to recall, like a forgatten memory screen saver?
   I have this feeling something is terribly wrong and it has to deal with who I am now.  For the most part, I have become a tactophobe, repulsed and on occaision very frightened by human contact of any kind.  And while I have always had a special kind of dislike for PDAs of any kind, lately, things have gotten fucking ridiculous; I actually found myself sneering at a young mother in my store today when she went to pick up her infant that was strapped into one of those shopping cart seats.  A fucking young mother and a baby!  What is wrong with me?!?!?
   Okay.  Before I thorughly go off the deep end, let me stop.  I need sleep and the Melatonin I took about halfway through this enrty is starting to kick in.  I sort of hope no one but Laila will read this b/c getting comments on this half-lucid, paranoid fragment of me and my little wounds would really put me over the edge right now.  Shit.  Now I 've gone and made you believe, dear reader, that I am considering killing myself or worse, so let me say this and sign off:  I AM NOT SUICIDAL...I'M JUST IRRITATED AND EXTREMELY SLEEP DEPRIVED AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME.

Love and all that shit,

Shannon


P.S.  If you are compelled to write a comment, please write for me the worst joke that you have ever heard; it will sound silly and romantic, but I really do belive laughter is the best medicine.  And if you're trying to figure out how the worst joke in the world could make me laugh, than you have obviously never watched the film ""Mars Attacks!"""

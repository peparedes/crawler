"event","Yeah, I'm lame I know.  I really shoulda updated a week ago at least.

This is gonna sound lame also, but here it is.  I'm busy applying to colleges and being addicted to fantasy and... for some reason I've been suing the time late at night that I usually update LJ writing this random story.  It's about some kids in Florida who steal some moeny.  Lame huh?  Maybe you'll see it if I don't get too irritated at it.  Any way, sorry and hope everyone's doing well.

List a Minium of 10 to a Maxium of 25 songs that express you and everything in your life and included the title of the movie that is based on your life !""<br /> <br /> Running with Scissors: The accident of Renny<br /> (That title was <b>mine </b>long before it was a movie)<br /> Not in any particular order,<br /> <br /> 1. Dude Looks Like a Lady-Aerosmith (Not a literal interpretation, mind you)<br /> 2. Every Breath You Take-The Police (Stalking is my second favorite sport)<br /> 3. Holding Out for a Hero-Frou Frou version (Aren't we all?)<br /> 4. Livin La Vida Loca-Shrek Version (This is so my relations)<br /> 5. Come As You Are-Nirvana (Just a damn cool song, I think you can spin this anyway you please)<br /> 6. Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)-Garbage (I wish this applied)<br /> 7. Here Without You- 3 Doors Down (We've all done the tragic missing people thing, but I've had extra practice)<br /> 8. Crazy-Gnarls Barkley (BTW I liked this song before anyone else did, so there :p. And I am entirelly a nutcase, in case anyone didn't notice)<br /> 9. From Paris To Berlin (Radio Edit)-Infernal (Yes yes yes and yes, this is me.&nbsp; Listen.)<br /> 10. Livin' on Prayer-Bon Jovi (A very inspirational song, I wish I could live like this all the time)<br /> 11. Gotta knock a little harder-Yoko Kanno (GO look up the lyrics to this, and find the song.&nbsp; Goddamn goodness.&nbsp; So true though.)<br /> 12. I've Seen Better Days-Sublime (My better days were when I was seven and had a tree fort)<br /> 13. Desperate Guys-The Faint (What can I say?&nbsp; Yeah, life is desperate, and so am I)<br /> 14. Fine Again-Seether (Seems like every time you look around your shoulder, something else has gone to hell.&nbsp; Be it my health or my work or my life, I let it slip.&nbsp; Then I curse myself, and have to start over again, but that's another song ;)<br /> 15. Crazy Bitch-Buckcherry (I like this song, so fuck you all.&nbsp; My next girlfirend/boyfriend needs to be a Crazy Bitch)<br /> 16. I will survive-Gloria Gaynor (So shoot me this is a f#$&amp;ing classic, and applies to so many goddamn things it's unbelievable.)<br /> 17. Once You've Loved Somebody-Dixie Chicks (Yeah, I don't think we need explination for this one)<br /> 18. Not Too Much To Ask-Mary Chapin Carpenter (Just, listen to it)<br /> 19. Dragostea Din Tei-O-Zone (No actual relation to my life that I know, I just lsiten to this so much it might as well be on my list)<br /> 20. Shut Your Mouth-T.A.T.U.&nbsp; (Compassion?&nbsp; The world giving Compassion?&nbsp; One of the best lies that people belive.&nbsp; I wish I still believed it.)<br /> 21. Shut Your Mouth-Garbage (Interesting how two songs of the same name have such a different theme.&nbsp; Shirley Manson sings about the influence of the media and public on her, but it can be so easily taken as the outside influence on everyone.&nbsp; God I love you Shirley.)<br /> 22. Bad Boyfriend-Garbage (I make a sucky Bad Boyfriend, but it's a damn cool idea.)<br />23. Bleed like me-Garbage (Yeah, this applies to everyone who hasn't had that picture perfect high school-- everyone with an emotional sensitivity and a self realization that is.)<br />24. Fix me now-Garbage (Shit, I just realized I've run out of easy songs and am resorting to Garbage.&nbsp; I seem to always be able to relate Garbage to myself, no matter how much of a stretch it is.&nbsp; It's probably because I listened to Shirley through all the difficult times in my life, so I connect everything to it.&nbsp; Meh, I give it a rest, it's late and I can find more music later.<br /></div><br /><br />I just saw <b>Man of the Year</b> tonight, which was all-in-all a great movie.&nbsp; It's about a comedian (played by robin williams) who decides to run for president.&nbsp; It has a pretty unpredictable plot, and I truly enjoy the twists it has.&nbsp; Go see it.&nbsp; Politically refreshing too.<br />My step dad recommended <b>300</b>, which looks to be pretty damn awesome.&nbsp; Do yourself a favor, go watch <a href=""http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/trailer1/"">this</a> preview.&nbsp; Looks fricken awesome, no?&nbsp; From what I'm guessing, it's about the battle of thermopoli (thermopole?&nbsp; thermopolio?) where the small army of Sparta held off a huge army of Persians.&nbsp; Somewhat based in truth.&nbsp; (Ha!)&nbsp; I read a book called <u>The Gates of Fire</u> which was about the same thing, and it wierded me out.&nbsp; We'll see about the movie.<br />Also a possible good movie is <b>Driving Lessons</b>, a Euro movie.&nbsp; It stars Rupert Grint (Think Ron from HP) as a sheltered kid out with a movie star old hag.&nbsp; <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3590411014850578376"">Check out the Preview.</a><br /><br />Cool, I have stuff about my actual life, and how I'm messing it up, but I nedd to get to sleep.&nbsp; Peace out everyone.<br /><a href=""http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/trailer1/""><br /></a><br /><a href=""http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/300/trailer1/"" />"

"event","So I have been bloody slaving over homework lately, I have so much to catch up on.&nbsp; I don't really mind it all that much, when I work really hard I can control my habits better, get to bed on time, find balance.&nbsp; I think it's when I'm stressed about homework that I don't take care of myself as much.&nbsp; Just an idea, but still, this whole ""get home and do homework until you go to sleep"" practice is not being friendly with me.&nbsp; I wanna life, jeeze.

Alright, I got nothing.&nbsp; I'm busy enough that I haven't really had anything intersting happen, 'cept for maybe DnD this weekend.&nbsp; That got...&nbsp;&nbsp; intersting.&nbsp; Bug me later if you're so curious, but suffice it to say that Melinda's boyfriend is...&nbsp; yeah.
Dammit.

So let's see if I can get 4 Stat assignments, An earth Science project, and a Scene of Hamlet read by tomorrow.&nbsp; You Doubt ME?!&nbsp; What fools...&nbsp; I'll only be up till 5..."

"event","So we're baaaaack!  And camping was fun shit.  I mean really fun.  Got to go out into the canyons finally, it's been way too long.  I got to do some Lick-Rock scrambling, up and down and backwards and into AP ruins, (Read: Ancestral-Puebloan, the really dumb political correct name we have to call the anisazi now)found a sick new site with a whole ton of pottery, and generally had a good time.  For those who aren't in the southwest, we just had a HUGE storm, and just about every river is running to max.  In the desert this means that all sorts of new features were uncovered, so the pottery we found has probably now been seen by anyone for a good 800 years.  How fricken cool is that? 

So now I'm back... and not exactly sure what to do now.  I guess I should do some work on my English, and I can probably handle it since it's Hamlet.  Shakespeare is good, Renny can handle it.  THe normal English-let's-anylize-this-for-some-bullshit-that-isn't-actually-there stuff is offset by the fact that I really like Shakespeare.  I mean, how can you not?  It just sounds damn cool.
Anyway, I should probably get on that eventually.  But I hope to get some decent music, cause if I don't I may just keel over and die.  I nnnnneeeeeeddddd a new cd.  NEEEED.  I don't know why, I just need one.

Oh, the big news is that I've teken myself off my medication.  SInce this is what has kept me stable for the past year, this is a big step.  I forsee some intersting things coming up.  Already, I'm getting dizzy spells, and uncontrolable fits of mood.  We'll see if I can handle it.  
No one tell my parents though.  Doing this now with no one observing is what they'd call a bad idea, and probably for good reason.  But if I did actually ""smart"" things where my health was concerned, then I wouldn't be Renny, wo9uld I?  This may backfire and bite me in the ass, but if I can get off this medicen...

That would be awesome.

So wish me luck everyone, and if you have free time tomorrow (Columbus day) call me up and lets do something.  To hell with all this responsibility if I can't have a hang day every once in a while."

"event","So when I said that whole ""I am now asexual thing"" it wasn't ment to be all that serious.  After all, it's not like I can control my hormones or anything...


..Or can I?  (Dun dun duuuuuun!)

In the past three weeks I have had not one, but three opportunities for cool dates.  People who through some bizarre act of nature are attracted to me, and would most likely go out with me if I asked them.  I mentioned one before, one is a band mate, and the other is a long time friend.  ANd the really bizarre thing is I have no strong desire to do anything resembling dating right now.  Murphy's Law is apparently working on overtimes lately.
How the hell did this happen?  I have no clue.  It might be all the drugs (light ones, no one freak please) that I've been taking lately, or it might be the fact that with my new found chemical aids, I am so totally comfortable with myself and my appearance for only the first time ever.  Wild how these just sort of.. happen.  I feel vaguely uneasy, just cause with the way the world seems to be working all three will hate me the second I deciede to try to date them.  But besides this minor superstitious nature of mine, I think we're doing kinda well.

I will, however, spontaniously combust if I do not get some more music.  Anyone have awesome CD's that I should buy?  Please give suggestions!!!

Shit, I have to go.  The family is going camping in Canyonlands area for the next two days.  I'll be back monday, maybe I can finish this then.  Peace, and
REni out."

"event","So yea, I've been really busy lately.&nbsp; I'll admitt, some of that being busy involves playing a lot of Counter-Strike, but I thinks that's justified after a summer of deprivation.<br /><br />I'm still working on English, so I don't have time for anything but a quick summery.<br />Anime club is <u>Awesome.</u>&nbsp; I wasn't quite sure how it was going to turn out, but I am just thrilled to be&nbsp; part of it, and the stuff we shall do.&nbsp; Party on.<br /><br />I need ot get off my ass and dosome college stuff.&nbsp; I graduate in a few months, and I need to do my senior portfolio, craft a list of colleges to apply to and apply to them.&nbsp; This somewhat contrasts with my next plan: get really high.&nbsp; I got a good connection today at school, and with some luck I will have a supply of Marijuana and Empathy before the week is out.&nbsp; If someone knows how to get high, and stay motivated, I would love you forever.&nbsp; Otherwise, getting high may have to wait.&nbsp; <br />Crazy isn't it?&nbsp; But my priorities have changed quite a bit in the last few weeks.&nbsp; I sorta feel actually motivated to get my life going, get off to college, do stuff this year, and make something of myself.&nbsp; I sure didn't see that coming.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course, the first step in that long line of priorities is to get this english done and get some sleep.&nbsp; I haven't even had time to take a shower since Tuesday and I am sleep depreived beyond the point I can really deal with.&nbsp; So I'll catch up with everyone later, love you all."

"event","So I was a total geek today, taking apart every bit of our phone line and DSL system trying to figure out how it worked.&nbsp; In the end, a piece of ethernet cable, the extra socket on the wireless box, and my brain made beautiful music together.&nbsp; And now I sit here writing on my LJ for the first time in my room.&nbsp; Horah!

The irony is I don't really have time to give a good journal entry.&nbsp; Somehow, I think I have the self-control to get to bed ontime tonight.&nbsp; Cheer with me firends, for I may pass english just yet.&nbsp; Or maybe not.

The nice thing about homework, is that with enough of it, and a few good fantasy books, I can ignore the fact that I'm 18, have hormones, and have obsessions.&nbsp; Yay!

Wow, I have been so happy the past couple of weeks I don't know what to do with myself.&nbsp; It doesn't seem right.&nbsp; I mean really, Am'y I supposed to get depressed when people betray my trust/insult me/ act like assholes/ are viscious?&nbsp; (That is only singling out seven people, no one inparticular)
Yet I'm doing just fine.&nbsp; This confuses me.

Oh well, it hasn't hurt me yet.&nbsp; Party anyone?"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Read here for spastic notes on Renny's horrible afflictions of Love and Lust!!!"">So for the first time since earlier this summer, maybe, say, july, I feel that I have my life under control.&nbsp; I feel confident about my school work, I feel confident about my school <em>future</em>, I feel confident about my family and home.&nbsp; For the first time in <em>years</em>, I am on a consistantly good basis with my brother, which makes me incredibly happy.&nbsp; Somehow, and for some reason,&nbsp;god deceided I could be in control of every part of my life for a while.&nbsp; More than ever before, I feel <em>stable,</em> like I have somewhere to stand if it all goes to hell.&nbsp; Partly I don't know how to handle this, but mostly I'm just savouring the bliss.&nbsp; Sweet, tasty control.&nbsp; Over everything.<br /><br />Well, except love of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; That one is just the fuck out of my control.&nbsp; Without Dalin around, and with the knowledge that I am going to see her exactly one week in the all of the next year, my life sorta fell of a cliff.&nbsp; My hormones responded by taking up a lost cause from years ago.&nbsp; Stupid, but not under my control.&nbsp; Now the same target is irreversably out of range.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; This has happened before.&nbsp; Now get over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Why can't I just listen to myself?<br />Being love sick is not entirely the problem, since after being in the said state for approxmately <em>4 years straight of my life, </em>I'm used to it.&nbsp; Yeah, heart breaks, cry in bed every night, bad dreams, emotionaly unstable, bad moods, blah blah.&nbsp; Get on with it.&nbsp; Eat Ice Cream, get wasted and stoned, experiment with dangerous substances, take risks, and I can deal.&nbsp; Maybe even come out a little more alive at the end.&nbsp; But what is bothering me is this is delaying a new relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I should confess something.&nbsp; Or not really confess, but own up to what most of you probably know already.&nbsp; Renny is so not fucking straight.&nbsp; Not even bent.&nbsp; Sometime this year I looked at myself in the mirror, and admitted that I'm as curved as the bleeding coastline of Hawaii.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; No biggy, after all my random experimentation with my hormones, this is to be expected that I don't stick with anything.&nbsp; Call it a phase, call me bisexual, I don't bloody care, but I will like guys and there's nothing I can do about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And...&nbsp; my second potential date just showed up the other day.&nbsp; One that won't move to the bristish Virgin Islands.&nbsp; What can I say...&nbsp; he's cute, shy, most likely bi or gay, <em><u>so</u></em> nice and wonderful,&nbsp;and seems to like me.&nbsp; However I see him asking me out perhaps by the time hell freezes.&nbsp; The ball is in my court, and I need to do some getting-over-shit very soon.&nbsp; I got trashed in a relationship&nbsp;again.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; It was partly my fault, but even in my most self-blaming mood, I cannot even try to take full responsibility for the breakup.&nbsp; Actually, that isn't my fault at all.&nbsp; Which of course doesn't make it any easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />So here I am, with everything else figured out, and hitting my head against a metaphorical wall of stupid emotional attachment.&nbsp; Whos fault is<em> this, </em>now, that I can't let go?<br /><br />I plead the fifth amendment.</div>
<br /><br />Grr, on to things I'm actually succeeding at.<br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Read here for cool things in Renny's life!"">The first foundation band performance is tomorrow and I'm excited.&nbsp; It's almost the same band I toured with the whole summer, the Excel Steel Pan Ansamble, but with a few different people.&nbsp; Unlike this summer, I've been working very hard to practice and play for this band.&nbsp; I'm used to thinking of band as a social thing-- I play, and in return I get to hang out with awesome people, cute chicks and cute guys.&nbsp; (The new guitarist, oooooo).&nbsp; Lately, though, I've been really enjoying just playing them music.&nbsp; I may be dancing around and looking foolish and like I'm just trying to attract attention, but more than ever I just love playing in the damn band.&nbsp; I got a few new parts on piano that I've just fallen in love with, and I love to hear the others play.&nbsp; We rock!!!&nbsp; Everyone wish us luck tomorrow at the Coffee festival, should be a blast.&nbsp; Yeah!<br /><br />I just got my own blockbuster card the other day.&nbsp; I've been renting a couple a movies for the last few days, and just watching stuff that <u>I</u> want to watch.&nbsp; So far I've already added two absolute favorites to my list, Underworld Evolution and Borne Identity.&nbsp; I didn't think either one would even be decent, much less incredible.&nbsp; Yet I stand corrected.&nbsp; I love movies that have a strong main theme, but in which a love theme runs parallel to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not the main focus, but as a sort of goal for the protagonists.&nbsp; These type of themes really leave me feeling fulfilled, like that's what I want in life.&nbsp; Someone to share everything with, and stay with forever.&nbsp; Granted, I might not find that until I can calm myself down a bit, but it gives me a hope, a glimps of something to strive for.&nbsp; Hero (Jet Lee) was also another unexpectedly decent movie.&nbsp; Not stunning, but entirely unpredictable, which is a wonderful change for those big budget Chinese movies.&nbsp; Besides those, I have nothing else to crow about.<br /><br />I've also got back into my fantasy reading.&nbsp; I'm going through all Mercedes Lackey's books again, and re-reading everything I can find.&nbsp; It's a cool experience for me, since I read most of these books when I was 10 and 12, so I notice all osrts of new things.&nbsp; I wrote a letter to here in late July, and two days ago, I actually got a reply!&nbsp; Lackey answered a plot question I had to my complete satisfaction, and earned herself a fan for life.&nbsp; No more library for me, I'm buying here books straight from her website now.<br /><br />What else, hmmm.&nbsp; I'm making a bunch of friends at school lately.&nbsp; DHS has a lot of bastards, morons and bitches, but it has it's share of cool people two.&nbsp; I took Jesslyn, a girl from englsih tubing last weekend and loved it.&nbsp; We froze to death, but it was totally worth it in my mind.&nbsp; Jess is just one of those amazing people who you stumble on and get&nbsp; along with better than people you've known your entire life.&nbsp; Oh, i have a funny story about that!&nbsp; Someone...&nbsp; I forget who, but someone asked me if I was dating her.&nbsp; Me!&nbsp; Okay, maybe only I find that funny, but you would is you knew Jess.&nbsp; How could she be anthing but your best friend?&nbsp; I just can't comprehend it.&nbsp; But I digress.<br />I've also managed to make a few pearls in friendship, as the saying goes.&nbsp; People who you wouldn't normally think of, the shy girl in the corner, the boy who shares at things but never say anything.&nbsp; That pretty accuratly describes Mia and Brent, two very cool people who I have had the pleasure of befriending.&nbsp; Also Ethan, the juggler who is missing a few pieces in the head.&nbsp; This of couse, makes him all the more intersting.&nbsp; I also hang with Jenelle, the cool chick who used to go to Excel.&nbsp; I don't see Ale very much, but i have lunch with her whenever I can and god I love her!&nbsp; She's just about the sweetest, most wonderful person I've ever known.&nbsp; Second only, possibly to Glen.&nbsp; But jeeze, I'm just ranting.&nbsp; People are cool!&nbsp; I wish I had five clones so I could spend a lifetime just socializing.<br /><br />Socializing, along with some other things, is taking time from exercise.&nbsp; I get a good half an hour of hard biking in every day, but not much else.&nbsp; I'm looking for something fun, but very active to do this winter, I don't think Skiing will be enough.&nbsp; Anyone got some ideas?<br /><br /></div>
So that's a slice of my life right now, I have tons more but I needs to go to bed, and I'll be amazed if anyone gets their way through all of this as it is.&nbsp; Just know, I love you all, and wish you the best of lives.&nbsp; May you always find water and shade."

"event","SO I sit here with a stolen lapton in my room, repeating certain songs on my ipod, and desperetly trying to get myself to write an essay.&nbsp; On existentialism.

Yeah, yeah, I know; the irony is indeed killing me.&nbsp; However irony doesn't seem to be helping me write this damn thing, so no luck there.&nbsp; In fact, as time grows, it just seems to be more and more difficult.

Blerg, I am hating english.&nbsp; I used to be so good at it, now evry essay I write seems like I'm stabbing my own eyes out, slowly.
With a fork.

What is probably the reason is simple dread.&nbsp; I have a bad habit of putting off difficult and uncomfortable things, often until they either dissapear or blow up in my face.&nbsp; This is neither smart nor responsible; one day I am just going to have to face myself.&nbsp; Sometimes it works out alright; I can get the easy stuff done first, then use my remaining time to finish the difficulties.

What end up happening, though, is I procrastinate until it's too fricken late, and screw myself over.&nbsp; Thus with this essay.&nbsp; I knew I had to do it when I got home this afternoon, but I decieded to watch Cowboy Bebop all night instead.&nbsp; It's now 10:00, and I still have no idea what I'm going to write for a complicated and difficult essay.&nbsp; Bloody hell, someone help me.&nbsp; God, this would be an ideal time to bail out your foolish child here.&nbsp; What about it?

Blerg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The sad thing is I almost want to go back to my depression/love sickness of yesterday, if only it ment this essay could be out of my life.&nbsp; THe problem seems to be that the more I agonisze over it, the more difficult it becomes.&nbsp; And I've spent no lack of time agonizing over it.&nbsp; At least romaticism can be solved by something.&nbsp; (That would be hitting my head against the wall until I forget about it.&nbsp; Novel, doncha think?)&nbsp; This essay, however, will still be here when my skull cracks.

Jesus Christ, help me!!"

"event","So, despite my apparent motives, I'm not giving up this journal.&nbsp; Lately, things have gone in the ""Private"" category, and despite evidence to the obvious, I do realize the need to privatize stuff.&nbsp; Most likely I will be coming back to this journal once my personal life stops&nbsp;gliching so much, and the rest of my work calms down.&nbsp; Read: When I finish my summer reading.&nbsp; (School started wenesday of last week.)

So I finally got back to DnD, and twas awesomeness.&nbsp; Killashandra, my character, however, suffered an unfortunet backstab by Suzanne's character.&nbsp; The situation was something like this; we were in a harrowed situation, and Killy had the bright notion of starting the battle.&nbsp; She probably could have won it given two more rounds, but Suzanne and Alex's characters decided that the only way to&nbsp;survive was to burtally betray me to gain the favour of our enemies.&nbsp; (I'm not convinced of the legitamacy of this, but that's what you get when you party with a Vampire.&nbsp; Phillipe's character suffered the same fate, and was very upset.&nbsp; I was upset too, but recent lessons in loss managed to prevent me from getting bitter at my friends, unlike Phi.&nbsp; I'm still really sad though.&nbsp; Killy is not fully gone, thankgod, but she's out of action for a considerable time.&nbsp; while she gets brought back to life, I'm planning on playing a backup character (who happens to be her brother) that I've been wanting to play for quite some time now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't chance spilling his secrets quite yet, but he is going to be a blast, simply because no one will know what to expect from him.&nbsp; Killashandra, while fun to play, has very simple motivations.&nbsp; So I anxiously look forwards to next weekend.

Grrr, I've been searching for the alternate sheet music to pachobell's Canon for wuite some time now, and have yet to find it.&nbsp; Alex, in her awesomeness tried to scan and copy it for me, but copied the wrong part.&nbsp; Ale has been in the interesting mood of first staying away and ignoring me, then being friendly.&nbsp; While this is human behaviour and everyone does it, it still confuses the hell out of me.&nbsp; But I will still give her my soul for this music.

Letssee, school's alright, but I really want to get done with high school.&nbsp; In a few months, if possible.&nbsp; Then I'll have a month off to apply to colleges before I do a semester at FLC, the local college.

Before that, I have 300 pages of 10 point font of a book to read before tomorrow, so I should probably get off.&nbsp; Love ya all, and hope to hear from you."

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Heiren lies general insaity and iwerd crap.  That I am not fond of."">So I never exactly got to tell about the last weekend. I don't have much time tonight, but I'll try and fill some people in. I went with the Excel Steel Band (My old school's band, has around 10 steel pans, guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, kinda big this summer) to first Creed, a small Colorado town, and then the Crestone music festival. Creed was a small gig, but fun, and warmed us up for Crestone. We drove to Crestone and camped there Saturday night. Then Sunday morning we played, and llistened to the other bands until we had to go. <br />I will say this; in short, Crestone was a blast. There were some incredible bands there, big names and great music. The dancing alone was worth it, I got to dance to salsa, latin, blues, classic jazz, and other random genre's, all new to me. (In that I haven't danced to them before) I got to dance with Ale, Nicolei and Kista, who are all fun girls. (Krista in particular had a very similar style to me, and I <u>loved</u> dancing with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to dance in the rain, which was totally new, and entirely awesome.&nbsp; Booyah!<br />The music itself was a lot of fun also.&nbsp; We were obviously the lower end in the spectrum as far as quality, I think we were there because of a ""affirmative action"" program getting young bands there.&nbsp; I don't care, it was just awesome.&nbsp; The people there were just amazingly nice, mostly hippies, but all types.&nbsp; I got a fucking <em><u>free </u></em>massage from a guy there; it is easily the best one I have ever had.&nbsp; A lot of the more stoner types stayed up late and played african style drums into the night 'round a bonfire.&nbsp; I really enjoyed hanging out with them a bit, talking to entirely random people about the most random things.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If this is what I get for staying up late, I'll be doing it a lot more often.<br />So the trip was awesome except for one issue that I'm not really going to say.&nbsp;&nbsp; Partly my fault, party not my fault, all bad feelings.&nbsp; Blerg, it depresses me.<br /><br />Emhem.&nbsp; On to other things.<br /><br />Soooo, I almost died today.&nbsp; It was pretty bizarre.&nbsp; Blake was working with the garlic, and I the maters (tomatoes).&nbsp; I asked Blake to pass me a bowl which was sitting next to him.&nbsp; He threw it Frisbee style, like we always do in a busy kitchen.&nbsp; I look to catch it and held out my hands.<br /><br />About then, I notice something coming up from the bowl.&nbsp; This may sound like BS, (I wouldn't believe myself),&nbsp; but time seriously got all slow-mow.&nbsp; I remember seeing this knife slide out of the bowl with that *shink* sound, and starting spinning towards me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's bizarre, since I've almost killed myself many, many times in different ways, and never had any other reaction than the predictable rush of adrenalin.&nbsp; This time... it was fricken creepy, even for me.&nbsp; reality just shouldn't work that way.&nbsp; I swear it took five minutes in my little ""matrix zone"" for the knife to spin right up to me, and it wasn't until the last millisecond that I realized it was going to hit me with the handle.&nbsp; That left most of five minutes of distorted reality to question if I was going to get a knife stuck in my throat.<br /><br />Obviously, it did not, though I have a little bruise that stings occasionally.&nbsp; It shouldn't last another day, but I'm still in a strange sort of shock.&nbsp; Why did this happen?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why the hell did I decide to get all ""Life flashy before the eyes?""&nbsp; (Thought it really didn't, I just remember having around twenty different thoughts of things I'd done in the past couple weeks, things that I regretted, things that i treasured.&nbsp; Little stuff, stupid stuff to be honest.&nbsp; I regret not being clear to people about my humanity; I often portray the image that I am lot better of a person than I actually am.&nbsp; Not that I can't be that person, I just am not him most of the time.&nbsp; I fuck up things, I make really bad mistakes, and I'm not always as truthful as I could be.&nbsp; I can't even have a decent flash back before I die for Christ's sake.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />SO it's over now and I wonder what the hell happened, why it happened, and what I'm going to do now.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have no fucking idea.<br /><br /><br />I guess I know one thing i should express that's been sitting on my mind for a little bit.&nbsp; When I first decided to stay in Durango, I went through the loss period, thinking of Dalin, and the few awesome people in the east that I would miss.&nbsp; It killed me, as it always does, because they are essentially leaving my life.&nbsp; I'll be back for Christmas, but then I won't see anything of you guys until after college, if that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />But lately I've been noticing that I don't even think of the east.&nbsp; It's just gone from my mind.&nbsp; This scares and depresses me with its implications:&nbsp; Renny is likely adapting to the constant moving and leaving by stuffing the loss somewhere.&nbsp; I may be over-analyzing this, but the more I think about it the more it makes sense.&nbsp; I think of Dalin and Sara and the rest and....&nbsp; I feel very little.&nbsp; A vague sense of disappointment and lose, but little else.<br /><br />And there goes two years of my life.&nbsp; What the Fuck?&nbsp; I guess we are really that shallow, this sucks!&nbsp; If moving means feeling sad because I'll miss important people, than I want to actually miss them, not just sorta morn for a week then feel like I haven't seen them for a couple of years.&nbsp; Bloody hell.'<br /><br />As of yet, I haven't figured out what the hell to do about it.&nbsp; I learning long ago that my feelings will do whatever the fuck they want and bummer if I don't like them.&nbsp; This leaves a lot of drugs, intense therapy or..&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole situation is fucked, this is the first time in a whole fricken while that I'm upset because I can't feel bad emotions.&nbsp; A whole bleeding long time.<br /><br />Grrr, I am angst embodied.&nbsp; This fact does not, however, make the situation less suckier.<br /><br />So if anyone has ideas on how to feel more sad about feeling things, feel free to share.&nbsp; (Dear god I can't believe I said that)<br /><br /><br />Oh, and Dana, who left the knife in the bowl, (big no-no at carvers) got a warning, and is suspended for a week.&nbsp; I'm just wierded out by the whole situation.<br /></div>

"event","SO happy birthday to me!  

Yeah, it hasn't been that special.  I worked all day, while Tera pretended to be nice so she can get on my back friday, but I pronounce that today had been nice.  Not because of anything the world did; I haven't gotten any emails, calls or anything that would indicate anyone else cares, but I have made today nice.  It didn't want to be nice, you can be sure of that, but I forced it to be so.  
So happy birthday to me!  I like myself, even if no one else does.  

""Sex is not the answer""  
""No?""
""Sex is the question""
""What is the answer""
""Yes""

That was totally random, but I enjoyed it. 

Yeah, so, despite my occasional tendency, (Like the last couple  of weeks) to be an asshole, I keep hope that I may make something of myself someday.  My sincerest apologies to the people I am unfair/cruel/mean/not nice to, I swear by heaven, hell, and every bit of decency I have in me that I' m sorry, and the last thing I ment to do was hurt you.

<i>Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please 
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees 
Come jump in, be my friend, let us do it again 
Hit the town, fool around, let's go party.</i>

I hope all you guys understand that I love you all, and even though I can petty, selfish, and idiotic, I try my best and love you guys.  It would work better if I had any maturity or responsibility, but I can't do everything.  I just ask that if you are unhappy with my actions, just talk with me.  I'll do my very best to be honest and try and resolve the situation.

If that last paragraph was cheesy beyond measure, my apolohies, but I mean it.  

""Oh I'm having so much fun!""

I expect almost no presants, because the most important gifts I'll be getting are from myself.  Not that I won't love gifts, but no obligations, alrighty everyone?  I know I enjoy giving presents to my friends especially when they enjoy them, and the last thing I want to do is take away that pleasure.  But the best gift I'm getting is the promise to myself that I'll always be worth something, I'll always be working for something better, I'll always be trying to help the world.

That is my birthday present.

Happy birthday world!"

Stupid paranoid internet people.  ""Dur!  Let's not put my name or any other identifying mark because surely I am important enough to be stalked!""  
No I'm not being serious, I just wish I could figure out who they were.  They are now on my friends list, however.  Anyone who considers me a friend can expect the same in return.  (With three known exceptions)

So Alex, Nichole, Javi and Krsita took me rock climbing at cascade the other today, which was a blast.  I might have lost my job after walking out to go climb, but in my mind it was worth it.  (Please don't prove me right god.)  I really, reallllly want to do cascade creek this summer, but something tells me that I'll be doing it alone.   (I am getting some additional friends once I start DHS.  Friends who have the concept; ""trying new things"" in their vocabulary)

I had a great weekend, which is good, because I needed some relaxation.  The next couple of weeks are going to be absolutely crazy; my cousins are here for a while, I have to regester at DHS, and try and get classes at FLC, help the foundation of the new house be built,  fly back to Connecticut, and maybe have a birthday somewhere in there.  
God help me.

Or anyone else for that matter.  When i get off work Wenesday, it would be a really awesome birthday present to have someone to talk to instead of going home and crying.

Meh, feel my agnst.  Grrr.  Grrrrrrrrr.

Anyway, here's luck and love to anyone listening.  Ren off.


One last random comment; SOme of you are aware that my music listening tendency can be very erratic.  Specifically I have a few songs that I can play over and over and over, and never get tired of.  Dragostar Din Tey is one of them, (Think Numa Numa song) as is ""Carry on my Wayward Son"" by Kansas.  I recently, however, got the most spastic addition to the list; Barbie Girl by Aqua.  Phear my music, for it shall destroy all respect you ever had of me!!!!"

"event","So uh, a little bit's happened since last update and I can sleep in tomorrow so I'm updating.  Sunday was a fascinating combination of pain and pleasure, almost half and half.  I slept in, but was immedietly wakened by a huge lecture involving both parents.  The wasting of the night before was the main topic, but after I out sarcasmed everything they had to say, we went on to other complaints.; ""Sure, I'll never drink in the house again, I'll find a bar or park and be in oublic or somewhere dangerous, or better yet, a party, an drive home afterwards and oh!  you really want me wasted while you're around?  that's good to know!  you're right, since I work  at a bar you can totally control how much I drink and where and when!""  It turned into a rag-on-Renny episode for two and a half hours, which seemed closed to two and a half years.  My cloths, my chores, my habits, my responsibilities, everything.  These use to come pretty often, but It's been over six months so it was a little shock.  After that unpleasant episode, I went Rafting!

SO I was ina ducky that actually functioned this time, which made things incredibly easier.  I could surf waves, and direct the damn boat, and all sorts of cool things.  I did flip going through smelter, but so did everyone in my family; smelter had a viscious lateral at that water level.  I then proceeded to drag my boat to the top of the rapid and try again, and I made it through!  It was pretty gratifying, especially after that last time in which Alex made it and I didn't.  My brother and I had fun paddling into smelter from the bottom via the eddies, and being spit back out again, then we finished the trip.
Today was another long day at work, but I did manage to get a lot of work on my character done.  She now will be able to overcome just about anything under a demi-god, or at least survive the encounter.  i eagarly await this weekend.  (Perhaps too eagarly, my companions are not as intersted, so I might be stting myself up for a laarge dissapointment.)  I have a free day tomorrow, with only a few dutys, and I'm tired.  Hope everyone's doing wonderful, and I love you all."

"event","So no Dnd today, which has made me incredibly sad.  We had our first band gig, which went as expected, or pretty bad.  I bothced everything, even the songs I know, which makes me glad I don't have a critical instrument.  I just sorta hid in the background and pretended to play when I had no idea what to do.  AFterwards, we went to game, but Mrs. Mom said she was too tired to DM.
I know exactly what that feels like, but fuck if I wasn't really dissapointed.  Dnd is one of my loves, I don't care how nerdy or geeky it is, I love it.  It fills me up and lets me touch some of my deeper feelings.  Lust, Greed, Joy, Love, those really basic feelings that our civilized society has no room for.  But I tangent; DnD was cancelled, so I had no choice to go home.  I tried valiently to find someone to hang with, called all my other friends, even ended up calling Rikky on the vague chance he was in town, all to no luck.  I was deathly afraid this afternoon and evening would turn into another sit-on-my-ass-and-feel-dreadfully-lonely-and-depressed-day.

But it didn't!!!!   Praise God, Jesus, and Whoever the Fuck invented alcohol!!!

I got home, and parents left to go do something in Pagosa.  This is usually good, but today I really needed some company, so it was not so good. (My descriptivee ability is shocking now, no?)  My brother left also, leaving me alone to sit and geneurally be despressed.  

For those who haven't figured it out by now, it shoiuld be obvious that I suck at being happy without other people.  I admitt that this is not a good thing.  I wish I could be more independent and feel better without friends, but as of yet I cannot.  Someday I shall have to try and be happy with myself; for now, I need friends.  One of the major reasons I was unhappy in bethel is I had no firneds to visit after school.
But anyway, I had resolved to go get a pizza and moive, and try to not end up[ killing myself from loneliness.  I had picked up a pizza from papa murphey's  and two movies from blockbuster, and was heading home when by some random chance I stoped by Carvers.  I vaguely rememberd that this is Ned's last day, and wanted to say goodbye.  (Ned is an awesome guy, works prep/bar and is just awesome)  I stopped, pared the car and went in.  Ned, for some reason which is unknown to me, was happy to see me, and thanked me for bidding ado.  I talked with him for a little bit, and somehsow he got out of me that I was depressed cause I was lonely and a shallow person and all my little fears and angst.  (Ned has this effect on most people.  He is the deffinition of a bar counselor, and great at it too)  After a half an hour, Ned peeled all my little insecurities away from me, and made me feel six times better.  So what if I'm shallow and need companionship?  Is that Bad?  F'uck it!
Soo anyway, somehow he got me happy, upon which I returned to vlockbuster and bought much less depressing movies.  My decision now fits who I am, instead of how ppathetic I am.  That might be a mixed blessing, as my movie choice proves that I am either Bi-Polar, or Bi-sexual.  Or both.  I can't really deceide.  
And I forgot, Ned actually had a presant for me.  He wrapped it on the stop, and I wasn't allowed to look, but once I got home I unwrapped it.  You wouldn't think a counselor would approve of drowning your sorrows in alcohol, but Ned had a great way of explaining it.  ""Most people,"" he'd say, ;""are not going to forget their sorrows in alcohol.  It is a depressant after all.  Most people will for a time at least, see their lives through a different perspactive.  Thhis helps just as much as a paid therapist, as long as they can untilize this perspect to think over their lives.  And being merry for a bit nev er hurt anyone.""

Right now Ned's logic is seemingly sound; I've made it through half his bottle of gin, and feel fucking great.  I watched COnstantine, got heavily bored, and now am watching \""She's the Man"" for the second time.  God I love this Moive!  I may be Gay, cheesy, and downright shallow, but I love this movie!  I watched Mean Girls and Freaky Friday, and Clueless, and I can't seem to get enough chick flicks tonight.  And thanks to Ned, I don't feel wierd one damn bit.  If I enjoy rthem, then fuck the world, call me Gay, call me confused, call me a moron, I'm happy so you can just fuck off!!!"

"event","So the huge update that I have meditated over for the last two weeks is not being forthcoming, having picked up far too much philosophy and nihilism for me to excuse putting on the internet.  It shall stay in the depths of my subconscious where it belongs until it needs taking out.  I shall summerize the most important things herein.

Renny;  think/wanting to stay in Durango.  Yes, we bitched about it last update, and it has turned into a  ""...fuck, could I actually do that?"" topic with me struggling and so far failing to get any plans or logistics in place.  I haven't even gotten in touch with my mother and step-father, a highly necessary step if I wish to go through with this.  Also impotante: I needs to get my transcript from bethel and figure out what I'm going to take this coming year at DHS.  I've always been hesitant to go to the school where all my elementary bullies unded up, but with any luck none of them will remember me by now.  I met up with Zach MaGill, and old aquantance from elementary, and he seemed to be a fine fellow.  I hope to find more like him at DHS; laidback, friendly, and just damn cool.
We shall we.  I also must somehow arrange a ride back to CT to pick up shit and say goodbye to people, and then come back.  With the way my dad is acting, I may be paying for this myself.  (He's wierd, we know this)  If that is the worst part of moving back, I'll take it with a smile, but a part of me senses quite a bit more difficulty.  

But which part you ask?  A question worthy of consideration.  It may be the part of me that fears all change, or the part that questions everything I do.  Perhaps it is the cynic within me, or perhaps the part of me which is enternally on LSD.

They call it ""Combat Cards"" and it is a system created by a most wacky person.  (Go look him up, he has a giant random wikki).  For those who believe I should be at band now, they are right, but my father has unfortunetly given me a ""one activity"" schedule today, as I am recovering from a bad sickness.  And Pirates with Phi and Ale deffinetely takes priority.  Just think, I can lazily reach my arm over both of them!

Which shall cause choas when Phi freaks.  Still, it shall be fun and amusing.
(Phi is Ale's little bro, who while somewhat open minded, is like most boys in being very uncomfortable with other males attraction for him.  And the reactions from him make it all worth it.)

Without further ado, I give you:

"event","So I've started at Carvers, and am currently working a M-W-F schedule which lets me go to band on tuesdays and thursdays.  Sweetness embodied.  Carvers has changed remarkably little, with most of the same people.  What has changed is instead of slaving at the dishwasher, I am slaving as a prep cook.  Which, I should add, is far more enjoyable.  People rely much less on my instintanious actions, and falling behind is less of a problem.  Also; I make more money, can socialize more, get less wet and dirty, and am all in all more relaxed.  Win-win: I win, and I win again.  
I've only worked two days now, and am already getting bored of getting wasted after work.  Strange huh?  That was all I could think of during school, drowning myself in Alcohol, but it gets very boring very quickly.  Or not boring, but... plain.  My taste for beer has increased though, I really enjoy the light rasberry ale and brokeback beers they have.  (Yes, that is in fact named after the movie.)  I still cannot stomach anything close to pure rum, and I'm getting bored just talking about this.

So DnD starts tomorrow.  I am incredibly psyched.  I re-made Killashandra, my rogue for this, and look forward to kicking some ass.  I've roleplayed online way too much lately, I need some ordinary bash and slam DnD.  Bring on the gold and maidens, it's time for a reckoning. 

Have to figure out how to get in contact with the girlfriend, as calling has not been sucessful, and neither has psyhcic communication.  Hope she'll remember me.

If I had felt how I do now a month ago, I would have moved back to Durango.  Fuck Connecticut, fuck schooling, fucking the whole damn east coast, this is where I belong, College or no College.  It's sad that in trying to do the responsible thing, I've screwed myself over entirely.  Now it's far too late to really do anything about it but get ready to suffer next year, but for what it's worth I know the truth now.  Damn it all.  I can't believe Janet ended up fucking me over in this manner.  Talk of bizarrity.  
But I blame others.  I should have used my head a little more, and actually trusted my own damn feelings instead others's fears.  Learn something new every day!

Wow, that is quite a rant, I guess I needed to get that off my shoulders.  Now I can go back to being the victim again.  Yay!!!!
(As Alex said, :I'm really good at it, so I figure I should preactice it since it's the only thing I can succeed at!"")
Actually, that's not quite what she said, so sue me.  That's what I'm making her say.

But for now, I shall have a fun filled summer to give me hope through the horrible winter, and keep me from blowing my brains out.  Band, Carvers, Dnd, Videogames, <i>Real</i> friends, Hot chicks who are also my friends (Dalin is not allowed to read that line) Alcohol, Colorado, Camping, Durango, Teh animus,God, I just love flipping everything here.  Except my parents, but I can deal with them remarkable easily for a change. I even like this house for a change.

Hmm, probably other stuff too, but I'm tired and am going to try and pretend I can get to sleep.  Love you, and goodnight everyone.  

And remember, brush your teeth kids!

"event","So, uh yeah, no one is allowed to read the previous journal at all.  In fact, I'm going to figure out a way to hide it.  Perhaps.  I seem to run into this problem often; I always fail at modifing LJ code for any basic effects.  I go into the FAQ, relearn it, and then forget it for the next time.  I present this as additional evidence for why Renny cannot ever be a competant programmer.

So my summer: has begun: is cool: and needs to get better.  Not because it isn't good enough, but because I'm a greedy, hedonistic bastard and need all the pleasure of the world to get me through next year.  Maybe.

Excuse my painful use of semi-colins, I was feeling special.

So I am here in Durnago, in our new house and thank heaven my luggage is finally here.  I get my music, clean clothes, my PS2, (Whichcut  I inconviently forgot the games to) and my Cowboy Bebop CDs so Suzi won't stop loving me.  Anime always seems to help that.  But they make me feel much better,  what with not smelling and all.  I unfortunetly left my razor in CT, and my temporary chepay replacement has suceeded in removing a 1/4 inch layer of skin from my face.  *&&^.

Yesterday, I was put to work in the fields, slaving for 9 hours in 103 degree weather.  I lifted rotten wood and moved it into piles, dug holes in the hard dirt, and cut an acre of grass while my alergies had a field trip. 

I really wish I was joking about that.

I am, however, bitching, and it wasn't quite as bad as it seems.  Almost, but not quite.  I was working on our futur house up in east animus, which is beginning to resemble a building site.  Not a building yet, but a building site.  The day ended nicely with a swim in the animus river, and pizza and a movie to relax.  Today was much better.  It consisted of waking up, eating breakfast and doing a family meeting, and that's about all.  Psyche.  No, I did that stuff, but then proceeded to invite and see the one and only, the master of water and wind and awesomeness: Ale!!!!  We went a trip down the Animus, with Ale and me in duckys (Small Inflatable rafts shapped like kayaks) and the rest of the family in actual Kayaks.  I throughly enjoyed the entire trip, even my short but eventful swim through smelter rapid.  (Which was not entirelly intentional) 
I spent a lot of the float lying down in my ducky.  I choose the wrong one, the seat totally deflated in the first few minutes, and the bottom slowly followed.  By the end, my but was entirely submerged.  And it was cold.  But it was still really enjoyable, just lying down, talking to Ale, pushing her Kayak into the trees, running into every rock on the river, and then flipping in Smelter.  Ale is just a really, really cool person.  She doesn't send me personally written Yuri emails, but, well, we all can't be perfect.  (Inside Joke)
I love you Ale!!!

If all goes well, I shall go rock climbing with her, Krista and Nichole manana, and perhaps see Frisco.  I had something else to write, but I forget...  too many martonies I guess.  Oh well, goodnight everyone, may the Force be with you."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Herein lies more angst than is really necessary.  I blame terrorism"">Yeah, so, I lied as usual on the last post, but that shouldn't surprise anyone.  My reasoning is that Dalin has no internet, I'm goin to see Ale really soon, and I've already seen all my other pals here in Durango.  I surprised Suzi as she got out of the shower, (*evil cackle*) and I took her, Nichole and Krista to my new pad in Riverview.  For those who don't know, (Though I've probably said this before) my dad sold the old house in Rockridge.  I will not try and explain his reasons, for they make no sense to me, but we are in a rental home until they finish building their house in a swamp next to east animus.  Perhaps swamp is a slight exxageration, but it has way to much water on the ground for my preference.  Luckily, I have another year before that, and this house isn't all that bad.  I have my own room, which means my brother and I won't be forced to kill each other, and our back yard is fricken <i>huge</i>.  

And I'm in Durango bitches!!!
I'm not sure what's better, the friend ands places and opportunities or the pure relief of being done with school.  The only downside I see so far is that my Dad and Step-mother, if anything, have gotten harder to deal with.  I'm going to make a habit of never ever being home when they get home, because I get yelled at and critized for every possible mistake.  It's like when they come home they want their house to be exactly one way, and everything I do violates that.  That, and they're just fricken mean and impolite.
But I bitch, and we already know this.  Mom is a better parent, Dad lives in a better place.  Therein lies the dilemma which I have combated the last two years.
Bleh, I'm just really fricken depressed.  By all means I should be happy, being done with school, being in a wonderful place with wonderful friends and a great great job...
But I'm still depressed as all hell.  I really don't know why.  Partly it's because no matter how wonderful it is now, I just know it will be horrible in two months and I can't help but remember it.  Partly because I'm totally drained from school, and am letting down.  Partly because I feel like I've betrayed my friends here by expecting to just come during the summer and be with them, as if I could still know them after two years of being across the fucking country.  Party because my luggage is in Alaska and I have no new cloths, no hair products, and most of all, no Lexipro for the last four days.  Fuck what the doctor says, I feel it.  Partly beacuse I feel like I'm just not worth anything, and should just survive through high school, and wait till I can become a proper alcoholic.

Jesus I feel angsty.  I just dropped this afternoon after Suzanne left, and haven't felt worth a damn sense.  Is this all I am, a hedonistic flirt who jumps from state to state trying to find companionship and stave off the loneliness till I leave the next month?  I really couldn't give you a fucking straight answer now, so I won't try.  I've been rotten to my brother, and I don't care if he's been worse back, I should be better than that.  Its benn two days since I saw Dalin and I've already forgotten I'm worth anything to anyone?  Was I ever?  I can't seem to prove it right now.

Shit, I can't seem to think of anything else, so I'm gonna drown myself in chemicals, and try to get some sleep.  This is acomplishing exactly nothing, and I hope I don't ruin anyone's day.  Just remember you're probably smarter, prettier, and worth a whole fucking lot more than me.</lj-cut>"

"event","Hey, so I said I'd update yesterday, but well, I figure a day late is so large an improvement from my previous schedule I shouldn't be complaining.  I got me a saturday with no mother to bitch at me, and life is good.  I shall ignore jobs, homework, and other responisble things and go see my girlfriend, play a vouple hours of CounterStrike, and update LiveJournal.  Life ain't so bad sometimes.  

I recently discovered my library's CD collection.  Despite the amount of time I spend in the library, I'd never seen it before.  Well today, when the kleenex upstair was gone, I took the elevator down to the teen's sectiom, somewhere that I never go.  (I haven't read Boxcar children in while)  Right behind this section in a secluded corner there was a shelf of CDs, which I promptly stole to take home and burn.  THeir collection isn't very good, only a few hundred in total, but it gives me another place to look for music.  Soon I will be able to attack KDUR's collection in Durango, but for now I am listening to Matchbox 20 and Bon Jovi, somewhat decent CDs.  I got 4 David Bowie CDs, since everyone says he's awesome, but I was disapointed.  He certainly isn't bad, but I didn't really find anything that particularly attracted me.  Oh well, plenty more where that came from.  Still on my list to listen to is The WHo, John Denver, Motley Crue, Madonna and many others.  Phear my l33t DJ skilz.
I'm really looking forwards to Djing at Kdur this summer with Jay.  For those who don't know, that is the local college radio station. Jay Hecker a family friend and father of Alethia (Awesome girl from excel) DJs there, and lets me help and chose some music.  It's scary as hell broadcasting to some couple hundred people over the radio, but it's also quite the rush.  I find myself looking at my music in very different perspectives, guessing how different people will see it.  And then I play rammstein and blow their minds out!!!
Uh, I really need to scram to my GF's now, but I'll finish this when I get back."

"event","So, updating purely out of guilt, I have a bit to announce.  I might have to revise my choice of colleges, as my grades for this quater might be...   whats the word...  passing?  It seems unbelievable, but I think I'm failing academic history.  I have not turned in my research paper of the work leading up to it, and she is not accepting late grades...  so I may be scrambling for the next two weeks.  We shall see.

This is in part my time management skills have gone to hell lately.  I blame this on being in this state far too much, but I bet being gone for another two weeks and not doing anything contributed to my inability to finish simple assignments on time.  I hope I can save myself from failure, but it may be unavoidable.

Once school is over though, I'm going to be on cloud 9.  Thinking of this summer is outright intoxicating, and I get way too caught up to do anything else.  I zoned through my entire morning today thinking of stoner (buckly) park of all places.  My relationship to Durango is that classic situation where I didn't care until I left-- now it means everything to me.  Funny, that.  I just hope I can make it to then.

My music world is expanding at about the rate of the inter, which is to say, very fast.  I've been using Seekasong.com, a convient little site which allows free downloads of certain songs, not many, but enough to get most popular singles.  I've been delving a little into the indie scene, a queer situation to be sure.  Indie, and contradictory pop music.  Funny huh?  I'm developing a like for Muse, 3 doors down, Stephen Lynch, Creed, Goo Goo Dolls, Nickelback, and Whitesnake.  Nothing too indie, but fun none the less.I just hope I'll be able to DJ a little this summer, maybe show off my new stuff.

Someone needs to give me Kryptonite, I still don't have that song, and need it desperately.  

I'm also devouring my usual share of webcomics.  My list now exceeds 175 regularly read comics, and over a hundred additional static comics.  And you thought I had an excuse for not updating.  <a href=""http://www.atasteofevil.com/"">A Taste of Evil</a> is cranking out after a long hiatus, and god I love it. I just found anew good ole DnD comic called <a href=""http://www.giantitp.com/cgi-bin/GiantITP/ootscript"">Order of the Stick</a> (All done in sticks figures) which is great fun to read.  Also check out <a href=""http://thunt.comicgen.com/"">Goblins</a>, a DnD comic which is most deffinetly <i>not</i> your standard DnD comic. 

So for the next month these are my goals:
a) Survive School
B) get the hell out of this state
C) See Dalin more
D) Get the hell out of this state
E) Get to Durango
F) Get really wasted, and forget every single thing about this year   (except Dalin)
G) Party Hard with Alex and friends
H) Get the hell out of this state

I don't have much, I have a mother railing at me to go to bed, so I'lll try and make this quick.
Had to skip SK, Karate, and tutoring, and I'm getting more than a little pissed at this cold or whatever it is.  Go away already!  Although since the alternative is school..   a rock and a hard place I guess.  
I got an unexpected call from Chris today, (Kyla chris, not my brother) and had a pretty nice talk with her  Conversation with said individual is always a little risky, as I often come away much less happy, than I went into it.  But this one turned out fine, as my self-esteem only dropped a couple of points, and I didn't feel all <i>that</i> stupid.  I ended up really missing her by the end, I hope I'll see her this summer.  I also hope I won't make a total ass of myself like usual.
I really, really, <i>really</i> want to see all the Red Verse Blue Episodes now.  The website only shows 1, 2, and then skips to 50 something to try and get you to buy them.  Since I am not rich, I will have to wait to borrow them from Brian, (Who <b><i>better</b></i> be willing to lend) or comit sepuku.
Speaking of videos, everyone <b><i>NEEDS</b></i> to watch this video, if you haven't already.  I did some searching and found a free downloadable version in high deffinition, so there is no excuse to not go see it now.  <a href=""http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=15796"">Go here NoW!!!!</a>

"event","Wow.  Today has not been a good day.  As if my essay wasn't enough on my back, my alergies have gone from annoying as hell to outright incapassitating.  My eyes are so swollen and itchy It's very hard to see, much less read the pages of small notes I've written.  That, a headache, and a burned out feeling are contibuting to the inevitable 12 O'clock run tonight that I'll need to get <i>anything</i> done on my essay.  That and I can't concentrate.  

Well fuck, and I thought things were improving.  A new quarter started, and that's always good news, but it seems I've gotten off to a very poor start.  If time spent with Dalin means less stress, then I am going to have to come up with some ways of relieving stress in zero time very quickly.  I just hope I don't end up girlfriendless before that.

In other news my brother has announced his likely return to Durango for next year.  This developement, if it occurs, shall be intersting.  I won't lie, and say that I'll miss him terribly, or that he'll miss me at all, but it will mean that I will lack an X-box, if nothing else.  Shallow, eh?  We'll see when the time comes.

So, now I'll try and do something on the essay.  A prayer here or there would be greatly appreciated.  And Dalin, you have my love and eternal apologies."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Herein lies the futher Adventures of Renny Young On the Epic College Quest during a week in April of blah blah blah blah blah...."">So obviously I did not manage to update on monday night, which should have been suspected.  I got home and was immediately sucked into Morrowind, a new RPG I bought.  Why am I not doing the same now?  Mostly because I'm at someone else's house whose computer lacks Morrowind, but that is an insignificant detail!  
Ignoring my usual pontification, I have just completed my fourth day of college searching.  I have yet to be unhappy with a school as of yet, which I guess is good and bad.  This means I will still have to make a difficult decision come next April, (Assuming I'm accepted to a few of these colleges) but I do know that if I don't make it into any particular college I'll be perfectly happy somewhere else.  In the end, I'll do fine wherever I go.  
If anyone wants a particularly detailed description on any of the forementioned colleges, I'll be happy to supply one, but boiled down they're like this:  Bard; exotic liberal free-for-all.  Drew: Prestigious middler.  Gettysburg; my-parents-went-here college.  Trinity; kegger, I'm-smart-and-thus-can-party-better-than-you college.
Mind you, they all lie under the liberal art colleges, so these are vague tendencies under that category.  And I still have Connecticut College to go.  Might even hit Westlyian on the way home.
In any case, I could be happy at any one.  It will just depend on my  mood at the time of final decision.  Or perhaps I'll just roll a d20.  Classy, don'tjahthink?
Beyond just the damn colleges, it's been a pretty nice week.  Wenesday night we got home, but tuesday was spen in a cheap motal in Gettyseburg.  I didn't mind the crappy room; the hotel was literaly next to the huge gettysburg graveyard which essentially holds every dead guy and gal who died in that town in the previous 200 years.  I've always found the dead peaceful; a happy change from their more lively counterparts.  I spent most of Tuesday afternoon just strolling past the gravestones and lying on the grass.  I will never understand why no one visits graveyards.  Even leaving out the guilt factor of visiting loved ones past, they are peaceful and wonderful places.  I can never feel lonely in a graveyard, it seems that I'm just a spectator of all the remaining peaces of past generations.  
I'm articulating this horribly, but the final message should be something like this.  Renny like graveyards.  Renny spend many hours in large peaceful and empty graveyard.  Renny Happy.
The only difficult part about either tuesday or wenesday was that both involved a great deal of driving.  5 and a half hour to be exact.  But I survived, mostly through extensive use of the ipod, and thus lived to drive another day.
<br>
Blerg, I'm getting tired.  I'll wrap up with a quick description of this afternoon.  We left Trinity come 3 or so, and arived at Robin's house in an hour.  Robin is my mother's friend in someway that I don't know, and wouldn't care, except for the fact that she's rich.  She has a huge house on a beautiful lake somewhere out of Hartford, and it's to kill for.  I got here, hot, tired, grumpy and hosting a headache that would down an adult rinocerous.  somehow my mother got the hint, and I was left along in my new romm to cool down.  I read a little, then came down to the lake.  Robin was kind enough o offer a kyack she had, which I took off with.  It proved to be just the thing I needed.  The lake is beautiful, I mean really just perfect.  It's the kind of lake that people come from foreign countries to see, and I was the only one on it.  I just sorta paddled up and down, into this nook, out of that,  i alternated just lying in the fading light on the soft water, letting it rock my troubles away.  One thing my father has managed to instill in me for all my resistance is a deep love of nature in it's purer forms.  well this was just what I needed; I went up and down the lake.   near the top, I found a small inlet in what seems a host of huge water reeds, and I followed it for a surrising distance up the lake.  As a crow flies it waasn't all that long, but the only channel through all the cottentails winded up and down, turning it into a long trip.  Aparently it's some ind of bird habitat, for I could not look a single direction befor seeing some new bird.  There was this pair of swans which seemed very curious in my affairs and followed me from a distance until they got bord and went fishing.  I also spotted a few ospreys diving into the lake, just beautiful really.  I was tired wet and cold when I came back, but truely refreshed.  
I came in to a wonderful roaring fire that was set up.  Yeah, just wow.  A glass of wine, a comfortabe pillow, and I reached nirvana a couple of days before the bloody dali-lama.  Even a dull lecture on how my college choices were irresponsible by Robin's husband couldn't lower my spirits, for I have had one God Blessed afternoon!!!
<br>
...And now I'm really bloody tired.  I love you all, hope everyone's life is in the end as peaceful as my day to days was.  Sorry if this piece is grammatical retching, I've no time to check it over or even read it once for that matter.  I've just enough time to wish everyone a wonderful night, and fall into bed.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Spring Break Episode I: Extreme Pontification"">So... yeah, I'm really lame.  Instead of going on some nihilistic rant like my last post, I will do a little to explain myself and try and make it up, and we shall see if it works.

First of all, no, I'm not dead, I haven't been abducted by aliens, or kidnapped by a ferocious tribe of Amazonian lesbians for forced procreation, (no?  damn!) I'm still here in the pit of Bethel, Hell, Connecticut.  I am about three-quarters through my Junior year, which is proving about as enjoyable as middle school.  (Which is to say, not at all)  I have missed ungodly amounts of school this year thanks to a series of resons.  (read: excuses)  
First of all, my immune system has apparently decieced to take a vacation, leaving me open to every bug on the bacterial (or viral) market.  I've been out with flu, bronchitis, (spwelled wright!) multi-cold, fever, stomach problems, normal headaches, and sever migraines.  Granted, a considerable amount of this is due to my terrible constitution and not just the various diseases present here.  I do however suspect that I'm not used to the many strains of illness that propagate the rabbles of New England.  
I have also just been having issues with life.  My medication Lexipro, which treats my depression has proved very succesful, but results in a few side-effects.  My moods are more stable, to be sure, but I am much more prone to anger and general I'm-pissed-off-at-the-world syndrome, which I really didn't experiencce before.  Mind you, I'd rather deal with this than manic-depression anyday, but it does result in a few days missed from school for ""personal reasons"".  I also have a few minor sexual side-effects, but let's not get into that...
AHEM.  So with missing a lot of school, one would guess that my grades have been suffering.  They have, but I have hopefully managed to keep at least lower A's for this last quater, although that may not be the case.  Only time will tell.
Which brings us to my future in scholarship.  As per usual Junior actions, I am looking in to colleges to go to, and visiting them during spring break.  Which in this next week FYI.  My current attributes I am intersted in are some of the following; small to medium size, decent atmosphere and campus life, laid back rules, pretty good tech facilities and computer science department, poly sci stuff, nice doorms for most undergrads, and hots chicks.  Wait, did I say hot chicks?  I mean bitches.
Which ever colleges proceeds to score the highest from that list will be then ranked by how much they're will to pay for my tuition.  Then I shall attend for a few years and learn a few things, get wasted a whole lot, hopefully lose something starting with a V, possibly find out what I want to do with my life, and just have fun. Speaking Of things that start will V, everyone should go see V for Vendetta but I'm going on tangent.
During this spring break, (17th to the 21st) I will be visiting five colleges in the following order; Bard college in Clinton, NY, Dre University in Madison NJ, Gettysburg college in PA, and Trinity and Connecticut COllege in CT.    Twill be a full, busy week, but I hope to get a good comparitive grasp of Liberals Arts colleges in Northeast, if nothing else.  Hints, suggestions, ideas, compliments and insults are all welcome in this large and complicated search.  Especially from those who have gone through college and what they think of it afterwards.

BLerg, away from responsible stuff, I feel I should offer the following disclaimer that I gave Ale, as it rings as true as ever:
""Renny is no more. The entity previously known as Renny has been consumed by a variety of sub-conscious parasites, and all that remains is a husk of a body and a few memories on the internet. He has betrayed his friends, forgotten his family, and left his interests to the dust. Perhaps is some civilization centuries from now, someone will come across the fragments that make up Renny's conscious, and bring him back to life. Until then, you will just have to read his really lame ass live journal and try and believe the lame ass excuses that a known imposter puts in his place for not attending to any part of life. If you see this imposter, do your best to kill him/her or in some way incapacitate him/her so that he/she will have no more sick and twisted power over Renny's previous friends. Acid works well, as does gunshots to the head. Best of luck, and may Renny's glowy, Obi-Wan-like ghost be with you.""
So yeah, I guess everyone should be making death threats on me, should make things interesting at least.

Lesse, I've really got to go now, but I'll try and continue this manana if Bard doesn't kill me.  I will also try and actually check up on the friends I have deserted, whether they be in CO or CT.  
For a final exit,

"event","<lj-cut text=""Angst"">so i was thinking i should go on lj and update so people know i'm alive, cause i haven't been on for a while but then i forgot that i'm not certain if i'm alive since last week was pretty hard and i can't stop shaking, but it isn't so bad if i can just forget for a little and get buried in book or games but i can't cause i have to finish my homework, but i should really tell people because i feel horrible that i've blown everyone off  and been a general asshole and even though it might not be deliberate and i've been busy i still feel horrible because i shouldn't let anything get in the way of friends but it hasn't been working so i've just given up and resolved that i'm a hypocritical asshole which isn't the end of the world but i should at least admitt it, and maybe something will improve but nothing seems like it ever will and i'll just be hurting forever but it's okay cause i can go insane when it gets to difficult and that isn't as bad as i thought it was and anyway school is slowly killing me and i can't concentrate on school work so i lose sleep and go further insane because of all people icannot handle sleep deprivation even in the best of circumstances and i try to do good things for myself but it rarely turns out well, so i usually just give upo, like eating and sllep, and drinking and all that stuff that i wish i could do but i'm not mature/responisble enough to do and i wonder what will happen this summer but anyway that's off topic, i need to finish photoshop and get to bed but it's so hard because i'm tired and easily distracted and have no patients with anything least of all myself.  Other things that are going on, well, i've blown off too many important tthings like my girlfriend and all friends and family and relatives and some of my other jobs so i'm not sure if my life will remain intact after this spring so i guess i'll just see.  i've been forgetting to take my meds almost conitually, which isn't the worst thing usually but in combination with everything else it's making my life difficult, giving me lots of dizzy spells all days, and sometimes worse, like today when i plain out fainted in spainish, luckely i sit in the back so no one noticed but it was kind of frighting just to lose consciousness spontaniously and i've been feeling just plain wierd and bad for a while but somehow i just can't seem to take care of myself properly, it's obviously a self-replicating cycle and i don't know what to do.  i apologize for the hoorible structure of tis entry i know it's a pain to red, and isn't even worthwhile bu ti can't seem to type normally tonight i'm so tired so bye,"

"event","So the rules are, once you've been tagged you have to write a blog with 6 weird things/habits about yourself. In the end you need to list 6 other people to tag and list their names.

1. There is no Renny, Only Zule!
2. If there were a Renny, he would not have just spent the entire day playing CS and looking at webcomics all day instead of playing homework.
3. Instead, he would have wanted to pass this year's school.

"event","A quick update to assure people that I am not, in fact, as dead as they think.  I may have decomposed to corpse-like-appearence, but my lungs still pull in air, and I still play Counter-Strike like a maniac.  
I apologize for neglecting livjournal, life has decieded that I should do other things.  Or, I guess I have, inadvertanly, but doing those other things.  Either way, I shall try and make a bigger update tomorrow when I have the energy.
Firstly an anime report.  I have purchased the entire Cowboy Bebop series, and watched it all just as quickly.  And dear god it is wonderful.  I cried my heart out on several occasions, but I love Bebop more now than I love oxygen.  More recently I have been watching Gumdam Seed as lent to me by Dalin and Brian.  While not Cowboy Bebop, Gundam Seed is still engagin enough to make me forget everything else when I have a new disc. (I've been lent the episodes in pairs; curse it all)  And lasty, while not actually anime, I've been watching Xombie; a short flash series on the internet and enjoying it.  Go look it up, its short, has zombies, and has zombies.  Fun for the whole family.
Other news says I am barely surviving my Junior year of high school, and my A average looks very precarious from here.  Wish me luck everyone, cause I'm gonna damn well need it.  School is mostly what holds me from updating this thing more often.
Also: I have the best girlfriend ever, and I'm sure God will get pissed that I've been so lucky and smite me soon.  Maybe.

Blerg, that was mostly usless drivel.  Except for the last thing, but I don't feel like explaining that right now.

Lastly I have obtained all Rammstein Albums known to man (Maybe women now about some I don't) and have heard enough to put them as my thrid favorite band ahead of the Beatles.  Let the skies fall and the mountains crumble.  That comment was totally inapropriate.  IF anyone wants to hear a truely awesome, divine, kickass song, look up <i>Stirb Nicht Vor Mir (Don't Die Before I Do)</i> from the album <i>Rosenrot</i>.  It's a beautiful duet sung in German by the rammstein lead, and in english by a talented young woman.  I may be an over-sensitive-melodramatic-fool, but this song makes me want to cry, and be really happy at the same time-- a neat combination.
Renout."

Yes, as sad as it is, I have spent 13 hours of this weekend watching the entire Cowboy Bebop show.  And the last two hours of my night tonight crying over the ending.  How girly can you get?  But seriously, I just can't seem to get over how sad it is, how wonderful Spike was, how much he could have done, and the wonderful people he left behind.  Fae was just starting to understand her place in the universe, and Spike goes and gets himself killed while killing Viscious.  It's not fair!

Yes, I have repeatedly told myself that it is simply a show, nothing more than an anime.  But neither my hormones or my emotions want to let it go, and thus, I have cried in my bed since 10:30.

GAH!!!  I am pathtic.  A sorry excuse for a man.  I can't even pull myself together to get some damned chores done, and I put them off till I finished the DVDs.

..noooo!!!!!"

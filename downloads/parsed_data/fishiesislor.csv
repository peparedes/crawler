"event","In a world of colour, life, confusion, 
We build ourselves into what we want, 
no one can stop us
We can lie, we can pretend. We wear Masks

But i will no longer be the wearer of my mask,
I will strip it off and run free of the burden of this life,
free i will run i until breath escapes me, till death becomes me, till life forgives me

Yeah don't ask me, this is just some random thing i wrote, it has nothing to do with me personnally, or anyone i know, but i figured what the hell, why not put it here, it's not like i've got anything better to with it, like what is it good for? haha makes me think of a song.. lol. i do this lot actually, i'll think of random things like this, sometime i get the chance to write it down, epecailly when i'm on the computer, but sometimes i don't.  see i write stories, i think of things for them all the time, but see, i get distracted very easily, you see it in the way i act alot, and work and stuff. I tend to jump from  thing to thing,  my mom thinks I have mild ADD, lol i would like to find out if i do, it might make things alot easier. But anyways, yeah so yeah my brain is insane sometimes, cause believe it or not i am always thinking, espcailly when i'm quiet, i just find it very hard to tlak about what i'm thinking allthe time, espcailly when it personal, now i can write what i think alot, but not if it's personal, ican't write about.. i dunno why, i can write about what nonfiction people are thinking, feeling, seeing, i love doing that, but not if its' about me.. perhaps what i am feeling at hte time will come across in my characters... bah, but it's confusing sometimes... i mean you can only think about seven things at once, and i try to fit more in there.. lol I'm done thinking now, i have to work on my music vid, and my sis is going to call"

"event","Take everything that you know
and what do you end up with?
Do you end up with a bunch of knowledge about the world?
about business? About life? about love? 
How about yourself?
What do you know about yourself?
Do we ever know everything about yourselves? 
I think no, it all gets lost amung thoughts
That is why you have ""significant others"" 
they are the people who will always know you, so long as it's true love

Tuesday was the worst.. it was good till about the time dani got into the change room after school. arg... stupid ryan... and wow ever since things just seem to get worse..i managed to piss mrs forester off twice, good job me, and shane's been acting wierd toward me.. not weird in a good way.. or a bad way.. just in a way i dunno how to react to... it's soo weird... yeeh wow this is a whole different mood from my entries but oh well haha. i have a lot going on in my head, and most of the time it doesn't make sense. plus all this school stuff... you know this is all ryans fault, why the hell did he have to come to our school?? and not see me? damn him! he makes me so frustrated."

"event","hurrah! i remembered, only cause i wanna write about this movie i just watched, cause i'm all like yeah! It;s called mixed nuts, and there was all these people i sorta reconized but couldn't name, well one in perticular an dit Anthony LaPaglia, aka JOE!! oh man, Empire records is the best, i gotta get the soundtrack, and the movie for myself but whatever. so good, everyone should see it, especailly if you're a teen, cause i think it's a movie that anybody can relate too, now i highly doubt anybody has a day that bad and good at the same time, or works in an awsome placelike that. I would give anything to work there. Although not if i had to meet someone like Rex Manning, he was such a jerkface. Anyways, if you haven't seen it do."

"event","It is decidedly COLD out there!!!!!  It stormed yesterday & the weather turned downright cold & has remained so, plus the sky is heavily overcast.  I'm worried that I left the cleanup of the patio set too late.  Surely the sun; will shine again - after all, this is New Mexico and it isn't winter yet, or is it?

I saw an article which intrigued me in a magazine that Pete subscribes to called The Week.  It referred to the high rate of rape which occurs in South Africa and the steps one doctor took to prevent it.  One of her patients inspired by saying that she wished she had teeth 'down there.'  So the doctor invented a feminine condom which seizes the invading penis in a most painful grip and makes him think only of getting himself some medical help of his own.  I thought that was a great way of evening up the battlefield where women are seen as the spoils of war."

"event","I was so sure I'd be faithful in writing in this journal especially with all that's going on in our lives now.  Oh, well....  We have not finished packing the extraneous things that we can do without until we & our things arrive separately in Florida.  And I've made bad choices about things I just knew we wouldnt need until such time.  Is that why I'm hesitant now or is just my usual manana attitude kicking in?  I have promised myself that tomorrow while Pete is working one of his days off I shall get busy.  We'll see.
The person (whose title is unknown to me - whose exact job in this real estate transaction is unknown to me) with the wierd name, KLynn, called me in a twitter this afternoon.  She was sure that there were pages missing from the purchase agreement which I downloaded from the internet because for some reason the first page is numbered 3.  It's all there just numbered strangely.  Then the purchaser, ditzy woman named Trish, was sure that Pete had told the two 'children' (Pete's name for the 2 young men who conducted the home inspection.) that they could fax us a copy of the report.  We don't have a fax number or machine so obviously her memory is faulty.  I, on the other hand, distinctly remember, the boys handing a copy of the report to her & her boyfriend & promising to mail us one. Do hope there are no further snags or at least not ones that are not easily resolved.  One feels liberated & financially smart by not using a real estate agent but oddly adrift without the advice of said professional.  Maybe they are worth the cost of the comission.
I am so looking forward to this evening's entertainment.  We are to attend the opening night performance of the musical, Chicago. Shiny! Pete was disturbed by the fact that I recognized the name of the actor who will play the attorney.  Tom Wopat.  You know who he is, right?  Yeah, the dark haired one.
Thanks to you, dear daughter, for introducing me to this great musical.
I bought a couple of cds the other evesning on my lunch hour.  (get the discount while I still can.)  One is B B King & friends 80 released to celebrate his 80th birthday.  His voice is still strong & he joins Willie Nelson in sounding better the older he gets.  The other is music from a tv series that I haven't watched but would like to see, Weeds.  Is there anyone out there who can tell me if the show is any good?  Well, the music is."

"event","Why are people working in personnel not personable?  Is it a job requirement that you be brusque to the point of rudeness?  Are you not allowed to smile or will your face crack?  I can only hope the cheerless manner conceals a painstaking ability to do things right.  As you can tell I had to deal with one of those people today.  My transfer requires that i get personnel involved & hope they do their job adequately so that the transfer which I have set up will go through without a hitch.  It's annoying enough to have to personally round up the general manager os the store's signature on the transfer request (he who I seldom see on my work schedule) but to hae to accomplish it in a speedy fashion was difficult.  Mission was accomplished before I left work this morning & only had to call back with the fax number in Tallahassee.  
Now if only James can find us an apartment in time......  Thanks, James.  We appreciate all you do.  Now if we can only talk you into planning a joint birthday for both me & Pete..........  We'll talk."

"event","A day off in the middle of the work week is such a gift.  Pete & I used our gift wisely with an overnight stay in Santa Fe, a concert, breakfast outside in Burro Alley & then a trip to Bandelier including a 5 mile hike past the falls in Frijole Canyon to the Rio Grande & back.  We drove home through the Jemez Mountains where the foliage is just beginning to show signs of coloring up for fall.  And, then this morning when I stepped out of work I was greeted with the most spectacular sunrise over the Sandias.  A truly gorgeous red sunrise which accompanied by the dark clouds seem to portend foul weather.  But in such a beautiful way.........."

"event","It's so great to have a night off in the middle of the work week.  Tonight Pete & I head for Santa Fe to attend a Lucinda Williams' concert.  We'll be spending the night in a classy hotel just blocks away from the concert venue so that once we've parked the car we can walk to dinner & to the concert.  I am so looking forward to it even though I'd never heard of Lucinda before I met Pete.  When I told a person at work the name of the singer I was going to see, he asked if she wasn't the former Miss America.  I suppose he was thinking of Vanessa Williams."

"event","I love weekends.  Pete & I fill them with all sorts of activities we're too tired to do during the work week.  Friday we had the house inspection (passed with flying colors, so no impediments to the sale there) and then we went out to eat at an Italian restaurant called Zia's.  Had to wait as we had hit it at the busiest time but that was o k.  Dinner was delicious with enough of my baked ziti to take home & have for lunch Saturday.  Tried watching Aviator but couldn't get interested.
Saturday morning, Pete got a haircut & then we played tennis splitting 2 sests with one win each.  Took a trip to the library where I checked out In the Heat of the Night.  That's a great movie.  We cooked steaks on the grill with corn on the cob & broiled tomatoes.
Sunday was Pete's mother's 90th birthday!!!!!  We had sent flowers with balloons & a selection of scarves.  Pete called & spoke to her at Jessie's house where the sisters were celebrating.  He also called Ben & found that even though they just moved a short time ago they are moving again....to Kentucky this time.  We did a moderate hike up Piedra Lisa before heading back home to enjoy the buffalo stew that had been cooking in the slow cooker.  Early to bed for me because Sunday night it's back to the grindstone.  I love weekends."

"event","The pace is really picking up here with the requisite house ilnspection scheduled to take place at 4 p.m. today.  Fortunately we got the brickwork repaired earlier this week & a good job it was, too.  
On the job front, we will be flying to Kingsport, Tennessee next weekend to check out employment possibilities.  I only wish that the one there offered as much pay as the one in Tallahassee.  Not that either one is a certainty just a possibility as of now.  Pete will be racing to the airport from work (I'm hoping he will leave early.) to make the flight & I'll be meeting him there.  It will be a short trip as we are scheduled to catch the red eye special at 6 a.m. Sunday.  A later flight would have added more than $1,000 to the price tag.  Too bad but we won't have time to connect with Ben & family while we're there since they're only an hour away."

"event","I think I'll attribute this to extreme tiredness as I just got off work.  I pull into the driveway, the garage door opener won't work so I'm thinking about that.  Decide to take off the jhacket I wear at work & leave it in the car even though it is chilly, close the door & WHAM!!!!!!!!!!  Thought I was going to see stars as the edge of the door caught me a hard one on the forehead.  I'll have a goose egg to remember this by even though I iced it right away.  
On the moving front - Pete talked to the potential employer in Kingsport, Tenessee.  We will probably be flying there to meet with him & my potential employers (WalMart & Sam's, there are both in this town of 41,000 people).  That means I can no longer postpone telling the folks here that I am leaving."

"event","I've already told family members about the exciting news of a call (possible recruiting) from a print shop in Kingsport, Tennessee for Pete yesterday.  That would be the afternoon Pete stopped to buy fruit & other groceries on his way home or he wouldn't have missed the call.  Oh, well, Pete will return the call today on his lunch break & hopefully get encouraging news.  
I find it a striking coincidence that Pete's ex wife had a birthday yesterday & today is my ex husband's birthday.  Also, my birthday & Pete's are only 3 days apart.  Is there something to this astrology thing?  Who knows."

"event","Sunday Pete & I got on our bicycles in an effort to shape up for the upcoming 25 mile Acoma ride on September 22.  It didn't hurt that the weather was beautiful.  Cool and breezy - perfect fall weather.  We started out riding to the Bosque bike path which runs along the Rio Grande in a N-S direction.  When we got to Paseo del Norte which is a 4 lane highway we noticed a path heading east along the highway we had not taken before.  Curiosity drove us to head east to see what we could see.  The path was in prime condition, pretty new, wide & not very well travelled.  After a few miles, the path took a sharp turn south along a concrete drainage ditch and lead us behind industrial parks on one side - houses on the other.  It was great & we were disappointed when it ended.  An enjoyable ride I'd recommend to anyone. 
We did more packing Saturday morning in preparation for our upcoming move.  I do hope the sale of the house goes through without a hitch as we will both be disappointed if it doesn't."

"event","Didn't sleep very well yesterday.  So, started the work shift tired and ended it the same way.  Hoping to do better today though the things that preyed on my mind then will probably continue to do so.  Let's see..........what have I forgotten to do toward consummating the sale of the house???????????  I did call & schedule the home inspection for a Friday when I hope the mason will have repaired the cracked bricks in the garage wall which occurred when I backed my monster pickup into it.  
I'm enjoying rereading Carl Hiaasen's Double Whammy.  It really is hilarious.  A fellow worker has read it so many times that when he asked where I was in the book he quoted a line from Skink.  That's familiarity."

"event","I guess one way to judge when you've overdone a hike (distance wise, dilfficulty wise, etc.) is this....  Just how much of an insurmountable obstacle is that speed bump between you and your car?  For Pete & I it was almost too much.  As usual, this one is all my fault.  I got up filled with energy & a desire to hike the Sandias one more time.  I have a 3 day weekend which is unusual enough to make me euphoric.  Defying the overcast skies, we dressed for all possibilities to fill our day & went out to dine at a breakfast buffet.  Turns out, it was a good thing we fortified ourselves with enough calories to last the whole day cause we would use every one of them. The sky cleared as we drove up to take the tram up to the top of the mountain.  I had thought of hiking over the mountains but in the interest of conserving gasoline had agred to a more modesst hike of about 10 miles which would have us h;eading out on the south crest trail & following it to the pino canyon trail thence along the foothills trail back to the tram parking lot.  Ambitious but not overly so if accomplished as planned.  As those who love me can tell you a trip into the wild with me is seldom accomplished according to plan.  We came to a fork in the trail early on & when Pete wanted to consult the map I refused to let him so sure was I that we were on the right trail.  A mere mile & a half out we came to another trail crossing & when the said map was duly consulted it turns out that we had missed our turn.  Feeling guilty as hell, I castigated myself most of the way back up that mile & a half where we found the correct trail & proceeded on our way heartened to be going downhill again.  Little did we know how much we would come to hate going downhill as various muscles revolted from being pushed into overtime.  The trail so far had lead us through various healthy ecosystems that we duly admired but pino found us walking through a scene of utter desolation.  Some boring insect had worked its way through an entire section of conifers leaving all of them dead or dying.  Truly dreadful!  The only green spots were the few oaks & birches which seemed immune to the insect.  Farther down we came upon some living evergreens which showed just how picky an eater though ravenous said pest was.  Unlike our last disastrous long hike we had almost enough water - closer this time than last.  Never had a paved parking lot seemed like such a haven as we limped to the car, drove a blessedly short way to a bbq joint where we promptly consumed the coldest most delicious beer ever.  I'd like to say we've learned our lesson but I honestly doubt it.  I will continue to plan more ambitious outings than I can handle & Pete will smilingly tell me that I've done it again but that we'll feel so very satisfied when we reach home."

"event","I've been intrigued by the journal entries of friends (relatives) to the extent that I have been lured into trying my own.  As is common, I begin by mourning the fact that I didn't start this long ago as so many interesting & exciting things have occurred in the last few years but now is better than never cause who says my life is becoming stagnant?  Certainly not me nor my new husband with whom I find life immensely entertaining.  The wierdest thing that has happened to me lately is that a chance remark made by a co worker has set in motion a move back to the home of my roots.  He dropped a remark that he & his girlfriend were looking for a house to buy, I asked how large, he said 2 bedrooms, I said, ""I've got one to sell.""  I never believed that would come to anything but lo & behold, we have a closing date set for October 28 & Pete & I are looking for housing in Tallahassee.  This brings Todabrilla into the fray as we once again persuade him to do us favors.  (The last involved checking out the site for our wedding, tasting the cake, planning the music, etc.  Trouble is, he did such a fantastic job of that piece of work that now we expect wonders of him.  He always pulls through for us, too.)  Though I would not have missed the experience of living in New Mexico (especially meeting my husband) I look forward to being closer to my family.  I was hoping for one more snowy New Mexico winter but you can't have everything.  A busy 2 months faces us but we will prevail."

"event","Since my birthdays on friday i thought this would be appropriate



AT SEVENTEEN 
(Janis Ian) 

I LEARNED THE TRUTH AT SEVENTEEN
THAT LOVE WAS MEANT FOR BEAUTY QUEENS
AND HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS WITH CLEAR SKINNED SMILES
WHO MARRIED YOUNG AND THEN RETIRED
THE VALENTINES I NEVER KNEW
THE FRIDAY NIGHT CHARADES OF YOUTH
WERE SPENT ON ONE MORE BEAUTIFUL
AT SEVENTEEN I LEARNED THE TRUTH 

AND THOSE OF US WITH RAVAGED FACES
LACKING IN THE SOCIAL GRACES
DESPERATELY REMAINED AT HOME
INVENTING LOVERS ON THE PHONE
WHO CALLED TO SAY - COME DANCE WITH ME
AND MURMURED VAGUE OBSCENITIES
IT ISN'T ALL IT SEEMS AT SEVENTEEN 

A BROWN EYED GIRL IN HAND ME DOWNS
WHOSE NAME I NEVER COULD PRONOUNCE
SAID - PITY PLEASE THE ONES WHO SERVE
THEY ONLY GET WHAT THEY DESERVE
THE RICH RELATIONED HOMETOWN QUEEN
MARRIES INTO WHAT SHE NEEDS
WITH A GUARANTEE OF COMPANY
AND HAVEN FOR THE ELDERLY 

SO REMEMBER THOSE WHO WIN THE GAME
LOSE THE LOVE THEY SOUGHT TO GAIN
IN DEBENTURES OF QUALITY AND DUBIOUS INTEGRITY
THEIR SMALL-TOWN EYES WILL GAPE AT YOU
IN DULL SURPRISE WHEN PAYMENT DUE
EXCEEDS ACCOUNTS RECEIVED AT SEVENTEEN 

(INSTRUMENTAL)

TO THOSE OF US WHO KNEW THE PAIN
OF VALENTINES THAT NEVER CAME
AND THOSE WHOSE NAMES WERE NEVER CALLED
WHEN CHOOSING SIDES FOR BASKETBALL
IT WAS LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY
THE WORLD WAS YOUNGER THAN TODAY
WHEN DREAMS WERE ALL THEY GAVE FOR FREE
TO UGLY DUCKLING GIRLS LIKE ME 

WE ALL PLAY THE GAME, AND WHEN WE DARE
WE CHEAT OURSELVES AT SOLITAIRE
INVENTING LOVERS ON THE PHONE
REPENTING OTHER LIVES UNKNOWN
THAT CALL AND SAY - COME ON, DANCE WITH ME
AND MURMUR VAGUE OBSCENITIES
AT UGLY GIRLS LIKE ME, AT SEVENTEEN"

"event","At first I was afraid
I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live without you
By my side
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you
Here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed my fucking lock
I would have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Oh now go,
Walk out the door
Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I,
I will survive
Yeah
As Long as I know how to love,
I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive,
I will survive
Yeah, yeah

It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry,
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
With somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me
Oh now go,
Walk out the door
Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I,
I will survive
Yeah
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive,
I will survive
Yeah, yeah

"event","Poison Oak, some boyhood bravery. 
When a telephone was a tin can on a string. 
And i fell asleep with you still talking to me. 
You said you weren't afraid to die 
In polaroids you were dressed in women's clothes. 
Were you made ashamed? 
Why'd you lock them in a drawer? 
Well i don't think that i ever loved you more. 
Then when you turned away, 
When you slammed the door, 
When you stole the car, 
And drove towards Mexico. 
And you wrote bad checks 
Just to fill your arm. 
I was young enough 
I still believed in war. 
Well, let the poets cry themselves to sleep. 
And all their tearful words will turn back into steam. 
But me I'm a single cell, on a serpent's tongue. 
There's a muddy field where a garden was, 
And I'm glad you got away 
But I'm still stuck out here. 
My clothes are soaking wet 
From your brother's tears. 
And I, never thought this life was possible. 
You're the yellow bird that I've been waiting for. 
The end of paralysis, 
I was a statuette, 
Now I'm drunk as hell 
On a piano bench. 
And when i press the keys, 
it all gets reversed. 
The sound of lonliness 
Makes me happier"

I swear I was born right in the door way 
I went out in the rain 
Suddenly everything changed they're spreading 
blankets on the beach 
Yours is the first face that I saw 
I think I was blind before I met you 
I don't know where I am 
I don't know where I've been 
But I know where I want to go 
So I thought I'd let you know 
These things take forever, I especially am slow 
But I realized how I need you 
And I wondered if I could come home 
I remember the time you drove all night 
Just to meet me in the morning 
Yeah I thought it was strange 
You said everything changed 
You felt as if you just woke up 
And you said, ""This is the first day of my life."" 
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you 
Now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you 
And I'd probably be happy 
So if you want to be with me 
With these things there's no telling 
we'll just have to wait and see 
But I'd rather be working for a pay check 
Than waiting to win the lottery 
Besides, maybe this time it's different 
I mean, I really think you like me"

"event","hello losers!
   i had a very eventful weekend on saturday i went to the river rage and had a good time i went with sam and pun. we saw tammie,pj,and melinda and hung out with them. after awhile we got bored and went to elizabeths to use her bathroom but she wasnt home.then kathy picked us up and we hung out at tammies house. sam left after awhile and so tammie and i were bored and thought we should go to the movies but no one wanted to go with us cause were losers.we went to my house and watched tv i made a cheeseburger. tammie decided to make paper hats and i wrote free martha on them. then we went back to tammies and saw kathy leaving and she told us to go to kohls with her. so we went to kohls and i bought a maroon shirt and tammie bought the same shirt in black. then we decided to go to the hallmark in the mall so tammie could buy lipbalm. then we went to best buy to buy a cd for kathy and look at car stereos for kathys car. when we were in best buy tammie kept saying she had to poop and she didnt think she would make it. so she waited in the car and when me and kathy got back to the car tammie had stunk up the whole car with her farts.
finally on sunday i didnt wake up till noon and layed around all day and then i played release with tammie and elizabeth. well theres my weekend hope you enjoyed reading about it."

"event","Summer in a way blows it only blows though if you have nothing to do. Which is why my summer currently blows! I havent done anything interesting and can never think of anything good to do and then before you know it school has started again. I find it sad that i cant think of anything to do its almost depressing no wait actually it is. The most depressing thing is though is that i havent found any summer love. I go to the beach all the time to see my dad and then no boys ever talk to me its very depressing and makes me feel like im a little ugly duckling.so iam going to leave you and go and try to find something better to do."

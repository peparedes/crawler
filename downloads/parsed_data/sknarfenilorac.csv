"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""year in review..."">so... end of the year.&nbsp; and what a year it has been. Freshman year pales in comparison.&nbsp; It's as though i spent 9th grade learning the ropes: making mistakes, finding myself, learning God, questioning things... and now, i've sort of got it figured out. and this year was all about trying out this whole 'being me' thing.&nbsp; and it's been absolutely incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I've been blessed with the most incredible friends, who have made me laugh and made me cry and made me punch things and made me jump up and down... friends that i wouldn't trade for all&nbsp;the world. i've been blessed with confidence.&nbsp; i'm sure of myself, where i am, why i'm here, and what exactly it is i want to do.&nbsp; i'm sure of my actions, my words, my thoughts, my opinions... i know now.&nbsp; things clicked.&nbsp; i've been blessed with opportunity after opportunity.&nbsp; through drum major, junior cabinet, NHC... and just being surrounded by so many incredible people, i have the chance to make an impact: i can institute change, for good or worse.&nbsp; and i think that's what next year will be about. learning to handle responsibilities and opportunities. learning to make decisions for a group, learning to do what's best for others and never think of myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />boys boys boys... i couldn't do an end-of-year entry without addressing it, and you all know it. and you know you got excited when you read this. i've learned in a few more ways how not to love, and a little bit better how to love. i'm learning what loving people is all about. and that isn't just guys... its everyone.&nbsp; i'm learning how to love everyone i meet.. even the most unlovable.&nbsp; even the ones id rather not associate with, i'm learning to love, for what they are. and in return, they're loving me for what i am. and i finally FINALLY know what that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;and this summer? it's all about 1. relaxing 2. revving up for next year 3. fun times with my girls and 4. fun times with my boy. <br /><br />this year has been incredible. thank you so much for making it so.&nbsp; last year i found my strengths... and this year i'm playing to them. thank you thank you thank you. y'all are the ones who made it amazing. and next year... next year will be even better.</div>"

<pre>Weep not, weep not,
<br />She is not dead;
<br />She's resting in the bosom of Jesus.
<br />Heart-broken husband--weep no more;
<br />Grief-stricken son--weep no more;
<br />Left-lonesome daughter --weep no more;
<br />She only just gone home.
<br />
<br />Day before yesterday morning,
<br />God was looking down from his great, high heaven,
<br />Looking down on all his children,
<br />And his eye fell on Sister Caroline,
<br />Tossing on her bed of pain.
<br />And God's big heart was touched with pity,
<br />With the everlasting pity.
<br />
<br />And God sat back on his throne,
<br />And he commanded that tall, bright angel standing at his right hand:
<br />Call me Death!
<br />And that tall, bright angel cried in a voice
<br />That broke like a clap of thunder:
<br />Call Death!--Call Death!
<br />And the echo sounded down the streets of heaven
<br />Till it reached away back to that shadowy place,
<br />Where Death waits with his pale, white horses.
<br />
<br />And Death heard the summons,
<br />And he leaped on his fastest horse,
<br />Pale as a sheet in the moonlight.
<br />Up the golden street Death galloped,
<br />And the hooves of his horses struck fire from the gold,
<br />But they didn't make no sound.
<br />Up Death rode to the Great White Throne,
<br />And waited for God's command.
<br />
<br />And God said: Go down, Death, go down,
<br />Go down to Savannah, Georgia,
<br />Down in Yamacraw,
<br />And find Sister Caroline.
<br />She's borne the burden and heat of the day,
<br />She's labored long in my vineyard,
<br />And she's tired--
<br />She's weary--
<br />Go down, Death, and bring her to me.
<br />
<br />And Death didn't say a word,
<br />But he loosed the reins on his pale, white horse,
<br />And he clamped the spurs to his bloodless sides,
<br />And out and down he rode,
<br />Through heaven's pearly gates,
<br />Past suns and moons and stars;
<br />on Death rode,
<br />Leaving the lightning's flash behind;
<br />Straight down he came.
<br />
<br />While we were watching round her bed,
<br />She turned her eyes and looked away,
<br />She saw what we couldn't see;
<br />She saw Old Death.  She saw Old Death
<br />Coming like a falling star.
<br />But Death didn't frighten Sister Caroline;
<br />He looked to her like a welcome friend.
<br />And she whispered to us: I'm going home,
<br />And she smiled and closed her eyes.
<br />
<br />And Death took her up like a baby,
<br />And she lay in his icy arms,
<br />But she didn't feel no chill.
<br />And death began to ride again--
<br />Up beyond the evening star,
<br />Into the glittering light of glory,
<br />On to the Great White Throne.
<br />And there he laid Sister Caroline
<br />On the loving breast of Jesus.
<br />
<br />And Jesus took his own hand and wiped away her tears,
<br />And he smoothed the furrows from her face,
<br />And the angels sang a little song,
<br />And Jesus rocked her in his arms,
<br />And kept a-saying: Take your rest,
<br />Take your rest.
<br />
<br />Weep not--weep not,
<br />She is not dead;
<br />She's resting in the bosom of Jesus.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></pre>

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""love. "">1. Love does not hurt. Physical and/or emotional abuse are not a part of love.<br />2. Love is not manipulative, it should not be used to get others to do what you want. You should never give in to demands based on the, <em>""you would do it if you loved me!"" </em>tactic.<br />3. Love is an intense feeling of caring for another person. It can take many different forms (romantic, friendly, familial) but it is always about caring.<br />4. Although it is true that a big part of love is putting another person's happiness ahead of your own this never includes compromising your values or being untrue to yourself.&nbsp;<br />5. If somebody asks you to do something that you don't want to do in order to ""prove"" your love they do not love you the way you might think they do. When you love another person you don't ask them to sacrifice a part of themselves in the name of that love.<br />6. It is very easy to confues lust for love. The true measure of romantic love is commitment and trust not physical attraction.<br />7. It is possible to feel romantic love for more than one person at a given time. Just think, if it is possible for you to love both of your parents at the same time why would it be imppossible to feel romantic love for two people at once? Don't beat yourself up emotionally if you find youself in this <em>unhappy</em> situation. But be sure to remain single and be open and honest with all parties and bout feelings and confusion.&nbsp;<br />8. Sex is <strong>NOT</strong> love. Love is <strong>NOT </strong>sex. Sex can be a part of romantic love but it is <strong><em>never</em></strong> mandatory.&nbsp;<br />9. Romantic love can fade. When it goes there is not always a reason. When somebody falls out of love with you it does not reflect upon your value as a person or your desirability.&nbsp;<br />10. Love should make you feel happy, secure, and appreciated.<br /></div>"

Every time i hear a love song recently, instead of thinking about my Ultimate Guy, like i used to, i think about God. It's nice. we're having a Love Affair to Remember. i listened to that song in AP WH today.&nbsp; everything about an Affair to Remember makes me inexplicably happy. it's so much more than a chick flick. it's incredible. as are the girls i watched it with. my dog was really excited to see me when i got home.&nbsp; Susie is coming home in approximately eight and a half hours, and i cannot wait. living for half a year without a sister is not something i would like to repeat.&nbsp; the big bush in my backyard is covered in tiny white flowers, and it leans over and trails in the creek so that tiny feathery white petals float through the water. everything is beautiful... everything is lovely..."

i have amazing friends. i realized this when i called Zach this afternoon ""hey, Zachy... will you do me a favor?"" ""Yes."" wow. its nice to hear that every once in a while. not 'depends on what it is.' or 'maybe' or 'what?'. just 'yes.' so now im up late doing my APWH DBQ. wheeee. but thats okay, cause im taking a break (another one) to update my lj. that i havent updated in a while. so, right... life is quite nice. kind of twisted in the 'im a girl and thereby have no idea WHAT i feel towards WHO right now but its okay cause i love my life in general, and love everyone involved, regardless' sort of way.&nbsp;

i love stephanie claire, my cripple. my sister, my other half, my strength, my comfort... my PSOM. keeper of inside jokes and giver of hugs and wiper of tears and only one who plays with my hair, and always ALWAYS makes time for me. who understands his priorities: God, then CAROLINE. no questions asked. best friends are more than recommended... they're NECESSARY."

In corporate world, never will we be able to wear jeans and flip flops every day, or eat cereal out of a ziploc bag all day, or have side-ponytail day or 50's day or twirly skirt day.&nbsp; you can't come home early and read on the porch swing or walk down the street to visit with your best friend, or get two months off for summer.&nbsp; you won't get to go to Lake Lanier and Six Flags and Stone Mountain after school on finals days, or skip out on Senior Skip Day, or harrass the freshies on Freshman Mark Day, or wear legwarmers and spandex and scrunchies and just be 'old-school'.&nbsp; You won't have National History Club or Literary Team.&nbsp; You won't share a locker with your best friend or tape balloons to your friends lockers on their birthday, or write notes on your teachers' boards, or run out of history to spin in circles until you fall down. Friday nights won't be Twister nights, and the movies watched on Saturdays won't be Disney movies. But right now, they are. Right now, everything is right with the world. it all fits, because i'm exactly where i was meant to be. and this is what it means to be happy. not to have a good day, or get lots of hugs, but to be exactly where you should be. to fit perfectly into your place in this world.<BR></lj-cut><BR></P>

But i got back on, and i've got 13 emails in one account, like 32 in the other, and like 6 pages of lj updates to read. i scanned them, because i'm not that patient. and my gorgeous new stereo is calling to me from upstairs... (5 disks and mp3 streaming... and pretty nice bass. my new baby.) well, i sign on and everything's DIFFERENT. the new little livejournal homepage thinga ma doodle confused me for a bit. well, i could give details on my Christmas break, but i dont want to. suffice it to say, its been amazing. and i cant wait until Summer. haha. </P>

<P>Dr. Cox talked on Sunday about <EM>making a commitment</EM>... and i guess i'm there. i have so many things that i need to either completely commit to or get rid of.

<P>*i read garren's lj and immediately wanted a milkshake so much... then realized that we have no ice cream. so i just went for the milk part instead. </P>
<P>*some genius (Lincoln, i think) decided to give the whole country a holiday merely to eat a freaking ton of food and think about how lucky we are to be ourselves. what a terrific holiday. i mean really, we get three days off of school for a holiday that celebrates... when the pilgrims got together with the indians and ate turkeys?!? yeah, that is definitely the coolest holiday ever. anywho, its a nice excuse for a holiday in November. i think thats why they did it, cause November felt left out cause it didnt have a holiday. </P>
<P>*how megan and i went shopping today for winter party dresses. even though we dont have a winter party to go to. so i think ill plan a formal new years or christmas party. how fun would that be?! yes. i think ill work on that. </P>
<P>*how every day is better than the one before... every hug is a little tighter...every smile stays with me a little longer</P>"

<P>i'm pleased. granted i was VERY displeased at first... as soon as he said 'break ranks' i was looking for Steph. but i cried to her for a second and then got over it. i mean, what does placement mean, really? the point in us going to BOA is to perform our best for people who can really appreciate it. and thats exactly what we did. and i enjoied it. i've been wondering why exactly i loved this so much last year, and just... hadn't felt it yet. but i felt it yesterday. both performances were amazing for me. and especially the finals performance... i mean, standing around Sam, i felt like we were all ACTUALLY one unit. we were all ONE person. and in our mello gathering, David said something that stuck with me and just kept replaying in my mind as i was performing... he said that <EM>this</EM> was the best mello line that Collins Hill has <EM>EVER</EM> had. and it feels so incredible to know that you BELONG somewhere, and not just <EM>somewhere</EM>, but somewhere GREAT. with such GREAT people. what could be better than creating <EM>music</EM> with so many of these wonderful people?&nbsp; so, really, i can truthfully say that i dont care that we got eleventh, and i dont care who beat us or who won or lost or whatever. it just doesnt matter, because were still the best mello line that this school has ever had. were still the best band in Gwinnett. were still the Collins Hill High School Screamin Eagle Band. absolutely nothing has changed, except for now we all understand what we're doing and why were doing it, and we've been reminded why we love this. we're closer now, and we can move forwards from here, to Indianapolis and on into next year. because next year will be great, if we let it be.&nbsp;it will be good, because there are still people who love it. So long as there are people who still love it, it'll be great. and i still love it. </P>"

"event","<P><lj-cut text=""deep thoughts""><BR>the rules of this world are made to be broken. every day that becomes more and more clear to me. i'm not here to follow the trends and be just like i've been told to be. there's so much more than that. the more i walk through my life the more i'm faced with the fact that there's so much more out there other than just my high school and my marching band and my friends and my family. there's a world of people, a universe of space... an eternity of God. it makes me feel very insignificant.&nbsp; But then i go back to what Sedor said on Sunday... God loves you more than you can imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp; i mean, he wrote you a whole book of love letters. i just opened to the back of my Bible where my concordance is and looked up 'love' and the list took up three columns!&nbsp; The whole Bible is filled with how much he loves you and what he would, and did, do for you. What would you do if a guy wrote you something like that? something that said over and over how he loved you more than the moon and the stars, more than his car or his friends or his sister or even his parents.&nbsp; He loved you so much that he would die for you if he had to.&nbsp; He knows that you are the most beautiful girl he has ever seen, that the light that plays in your eyes when you look at him and the lilt in your voice when you speak will remain with him forever. He wants more than anything to know everything about you.&nbsp; he wants to know what you're afraid of and what you love, what you did today and what you said, even down to what color socks you're wearing, because nothing is more important to him than knowing you.&nbsp; <BR>If a guy wrote something like that to you, what would you do? You would sleep with it under your pillow, carry it in your pocket, read it between every class, make a copy of it and stick it to your mirror... Because we all want to be loved like that. but what we often forget is that we are. We are loved like that, and not just by some changeable, mortal guy either.&nbsp; We're loved like that and more by the God who created everything, from Andromeda down to my cats.&nbsp; By the God who created your tiniest blood vessels and knows the chemical composition of every particle of your blood.&nbsp; The God who created the Sun and the moon and Jupiter's storm and Saturn's rings and who made Mars red.&nbsp; and HE loves me that much. He calls me his daughter, his Princess... i'm the daughter of the King of Kings. That would make me not just a Princess, but a Princess of Princesses.&nbsp; That's like having a double decker birthday cake when everyone else just got pansy little cookie cakes.&nbsp; maybe i am important. maybe i am more than just a speck on a distant planet. Maybe i can make a difference, change a life, break some rules. maybe i will.&nbsp; <BR>don't you hate it when you like someone more than they like you? and not just romantically or whatever, just like friends or something? its an absolutely horrifyingly terrifying feeling. Like you're losing control of your emotions again. that's scary. i like to have all my emotions well under wraps, where i can control them and make sure that i don't get hurt. Make sure that i don't depend too heavily on someone, just in case they decide to duck out on me. i'm losing control. </P>

<P>- i spilled coffee down my pretty pink shirt today. </P>
<P>-its was like 1135 degrees in all of my classes, so i couldnt just wear a hoodie over it...</P>
<P>+ i had an extra shirt to change into, since megan stores a crap lot of clothes in our locker (we had two hoodies and a shirt. and if you've seen my locker, then you understand that there isnt extra room for a PAPER CLIP, much less 2 hoodies and a shirt.)</P>
<P>-the shirt smelled like lit books. since we have 2 (those are HUGE BOOKS!) in that locker. problem? i think yes. </P>

<P>-people avoided me cause of snappyness</P>
<P>-felt lonely because of absence of friendlies. </P>

<P>the game was AMAZING. we had sooooo much fun. except we didnt do much dancing. :-/ but thats okay, i danced anyways (AND WE DANCED ANYWAY!! good song) i danced to the phat beats of my own drumline. heehee. yeah so thats all. it was great. nates afterwards- bybee came = so cool. hes such a <EM>nice</EM> man! im always so impressed with how nice he is outside of practice. leland came to the game, and that absolutely made my night. like, i cant even tell you. and he gave me a hug. thats a big deal for leland. hes not a very... publicly affectionate type&nbsp;of person. like, he usually doesnt hug me or whatever. but he CAME! i was so happy! i was joyous, as steph says. i assured me that my brother loves me, and since he's one of the major men in my life, thats very important. he really is a fabulous brother. i dont know what i would do without him. (""awwww..."" says stephanie. BTW- shes sitting next to me) so anyways. stephanie did AMAZING last night. it was AWWWWWWESOME. i was in awe. any comments on her conducting in general? (BETTER MAKE IT GOOD OR ILL BEAT YOU UP!)</P>
<P>okay thats all. except, sams bouncy face is AMAZING. i mean, look at those eyebrows. i wish i could do that. i can only raise my right eyebrow. and i can wiggle my left ear. and i have a dimple on the right. im weird. :-/</P>"

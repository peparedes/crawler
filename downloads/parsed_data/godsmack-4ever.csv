"event","2008 was somewhat a bad year,i worked at mcdonalds again,but this time i became a manager
but when i was there i met the most wonderful beautiful girl,things were good til about 2 months in our relationship,me and her went to california,for a week in a half,but the bad part in this was we got in a big fight,and i crapped her but the wrist,So she broke up with me and than i got fired from mcdonalds,so two months went on,She got back with me again,Than we moved to California,we had our agruements,But i messed it up again The day after the first,But now she wants me to go back to arkansas,I really dont want to bc i came out here to be with her,To love her,And i wanted to marry her,I just wish we can start over for the beginning,I cant get enough of her,She makes me happy,But the reason why she dont want me is b/c i scare her to much when im mad,n thats what happen
U know u never realize what u got til you lose it,If you ever get something and its the most important thing to you no matter where you are,dont mess it up,Make your lives better for each other,Realize it before its to late,i wish i can say the same.

But thats all for now

Later

"event","I havent wrote on this in a while so i thought i would be,well me and megan are not together anymore,I got a job workin nights,and i love it,There here is another reason why i writing jamie leigh has came back in my life,i thought i would never say that,But She is still married to tim,I wish that didnt happen,everything is weird tho,Cause when we were together it was like i learning how she was,But when we had to break up,She got closer to me,I still love her with all my heart,Everyone has told me to give up,But i am not going to give up a girl like her,I want to be with her for the rest of my life,If that doesnt happen than i wont love again,i am never goin to love anyone else like i do her,But even tho she is married he will never love her like the way i do,I dont care who reads this,This is my life dont help me be behind me,

But i think that is all for now"

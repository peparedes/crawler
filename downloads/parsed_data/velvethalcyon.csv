"event","So Jeff said something very intresting to me last night when I went over to talk to him. 

Of course he gave me the whole ""I still love you so much, Amy"" thing...naturally.
And then he made sure I understood that he didn't leave me for that tart, Tori in California. OK. I knew that. 
Then he told me why he left me.

He didn't want to lead me on. I guess he knew that eventual marriage is important for me, and he <i>never</i> wants to get married. 

Hmmm. Don't believe I ever mentioned marriage to him, other than telling him my mom wants my sister and I to get married asap. Hmmm.
I got kind of irritated right about then... considering he will want to get married someday - he finally admitted that - and I told him that when he does, that he won't find a better girl than me.


So there.

"event","So Star Trek as a whole isn't widely accepted as finely acted television. But there are definitely some times where it should have been.

Every award in the book should have gone to Avery Brooks in Star Trek:DS9's season 6 episode, ""Far Beyond The Stars"".

He brought something so wonderful to the franchise... great, amazing, emotional performances (not to mention great direction). He is one of the many reasons why I feel that ST:DS9 was the greatest Star Trek series. The show was much more involved. A person got close to the characters and almost felt involved with the story lines. At least I did.

So I just finished watching the episode (Far Beyond...) - which was a very special one for the Star Trek family. Just incredible. I've seen it many times, of course. And every time it never fails to make me cry. 

Synopsis: Captain Benjamin Sisko is having a crisis of ...faith...whathaveyou, and falls into what his crew believes to be an inexplicable coma. The Bajoran Prophets have really intervened and sent him (his mind) back into the racist, segregated 1950's where he is a science fiction writer for a pulp magazine. He is given a picture in which to base his story on - which looks vaguely familiar to Deep Space Nine - 400 years in the future. He struggles to get his story published which has a ""Negro"" man as the captain of a space station. He is told it will be printed and to everyone's dismay, is not. 
Now - this upcoming scene is the most brilliant performance I think I have seen out of anyone. Stage, TV, or film.
After being told the story will not publish, he is fired and basically disintegrates in front of us... the pure emotion that he portrays is so.. heartfelt and realistic I don't know how anyone could NOT cry, or at the very least tear up. I do. Every damn time.


Yes. I am a total geek. I am quite okay with that. I will always be a fan. There is nothing that they can do to make me forget how Star Trek makes me feel. Even Enterprise. 

Yes. You are probably calling me a pathetic, sad person. That's ok. Because you know what? The only thing I believe that I need in life is a TV with Star Trek on it. No matter how I've felt during the day, when it comes on... I leave everything else behind and live. Yes. Through a television screen.

So you think I'm unhealthy? Because a show can make me so at ease? You should tell me.

Like <lj user=""zerocaliber"">. We've been talking to each other online for ... ever. I don't even remember what year it was we met. But it's nice. It sucks to know that he's across the damn evil country... but it's nice to know that he's still there. And still cares. I love Kyle so much. I do. He's never failed me. I wish I could see him.

And then there is Chris. I've known Chris since... I was a freshman in high school... so I was 15? I think. We met in Seattle. We had a thing for the few days we were there. Have not seen each other since. We talked to each other intermittently over the next few years. We've been talking much more frequently in the last 6 months. But the most <i>amazing</i> part is that, to this day, we still feel the same. We still have that incredible passion we had when we were teenagers. Sounds silly? Well - you have no idea what it feels like. If you did, you'd be amazed too. Or, maybe you do know how it is, and you agree. 

So that's that.

Life has been a big blur for the past few years, so I guess it doesn't suprise me much. One of the last things my grandmother said to my sister and I... (her talking to my sister in the hospital) ""You know I worry about you. Please be careful."" (I look at my grandmother, she then responds to my expression) ""Oh, not you Amy. I don't need to worry about you. You can handle it all. You're good at it."" ... She was wrong. 


--
I'll just start where it started messing up.
---
In 2002 I went to Germany. Changed my life. Changed everything I thought I knew about happiness.
I was gone for a month, and in that month I lost my friends. They left me, like they do. I went back to school my senior year alone and bored. I skipped too much school and I quit.
In 2003 I moved out of my mother's house. I moved into an apartment with my gay friend Chad. I worked full time at various jobs. I worked at Pleasure Tattoo and got my 1st tattoo which is still unfinished, along with numerous piercings. 
I turned into an alcoholic slut. I never spent a night alone. That went on for quite some time.
I lost my best friend because he wasn't paying the bills and I kicked him out. Then I lost all of my friends to WyoTech graduation.
I went to work everyday from 4pm until 1:30-2am and then sat at Shari's 24hr. smoking and drinking coffee everynight until about 7am. I would go home (not the home I was paying rent for) with the manager of Shari's. We would sleep. Every Sunday and Thursday I would wake up early to visit my old flame in jail at 10am.
On occasion I would go to a party with my sister. That's where I met her neighbor, Jeff Cunningham, a current WyoTech student from the North Bay area of San Francisco.
----
On Jan. 8th, 2004 - my sister's 21st birthday - I started dating Jeff exclusively. I had just moved to Boulder, CO in December. He soon quit school and we moved to Broomfield, CO in March. We moved into a wonderful duplex with vaulted ceilings, 2 bedrooms, a huge kitchen and a very large yard. We had four ferrets and a beautiful wonderful dog that Jeff adopted for me after a tragedy later on in the story. He had a high paying job installing hardwood floors in Boulder. I worked at a gas station a block away from the house. We were HAPPY!!!
-----
My grandmother had been very sick for quite some time. She had cancer. Of course. In June, I quit my job to be with her. In mid-late July she died. Everything I knew changed.  Everything I had learned about being happy and content died with her. My once very happy, stable relationship with Jeff died with her as well.
I did what I could to cope - which included burying the pain way deep inside and letting it explode out of me every time I drank a beer (I had quit drinking heavily after I moved to CO). Jeff started to come home late from work - drunk. So we fought and fought and fought. 
I found a friend in Ryan Vier, a skinhead kid from Co. Springs. Jeff didn't like the idea of my having a friend at all. He punched holes in walls. I punched him. That's when I got another tattoo. I got the German flag inked onto my left wrist. Jeff got upset. He hit it. I left the house. He got a DUI while he was on his way to Co. Springs to beat Ryan up.
We made up. Things went from being as bad as they could get to as GOOD as they could get.
------
I got a great office job that paid a lot of money. 9 to 5. I got layed off the day after my 20th birthday. Jeff and I then drove to visit his mother in American Canyon (35 mins. north of the Bay). I feel in love with the area. We had great fun.
We got back after a week and a half. Jeff then got fired from his job. I couldn't find a job to save my life, but we were okay (his mom is loaded). We were happy happy happy.
-------
Jeff decided to go back to California for a month in December. I was sad and alone. I had my dog, but I was still alone. Jeff never called me, and would never answer or return my calls. 
Jeff came back the 3rd of January 2005. He was different. Very, very different. It seemed like he wanted nothing to do with me. He didn't want to touch me, talk to me, look at me. He spent all of his time talking to his mother's roommate's 12 year old daughter Cassie and her 18 year old sister Tori. It really hurt. Still does. I asked if he cheated on me. He says no... but all the signs pointed to it.
January 8th, 2005 - the day of our one year anniversary. Jeff tells me he wants to leave me. He'd like to go back to California and doesn't want me to come. He can't go to Cali because he's on probation for his 3rd DUI. He tells me that it doesn't matter - he's still leaving me. Loves me, but not like he used to. More of a ""I care about you"" thing. My heart shattered. 
I don't take it well.
I'm unhealthy. 
I hit him. Cut him. Wanted to KILL him. Still want to.
I make arrangements to move in with my Aunt in Erie, CO who just got a divorce.
I sleep during the day in my bed, Jeff sleeps at night on the couch. We don't talk. It's not good if we do. He talks on the phone for 5 hours at a time to ""Cassie"".
Then, about a week later I find his phone. He lied. He wasn't. He was talking to the sister, Tori. He had text messages. He said such sweet things to her. He had never talked like that to me EVER. Things - ""Goodnight, sweetheart. I will dream of you all night, I promise. XOXOXOX <B"" ""I miss you so much baby. You are so beautiful... I miss you.""  He lied. He was cheating. These were dated from weeks ago.
--------
I was... devastated. My heart shattered again. I couldn't see. I couldn't stand. I couldn't think. I couldn't BREATHE. I got my dog and I left. I couldn't drive, but I left anyway. Hurt and pain like I have never felt before. Goddamn. I loved him so much. 
----------------------------------------

So. I still want to kill him, I was thinking I'd go over there tonight and kick him in the balls maybe. It sounds like a good idea. Maybe tomorrow.

So. I am living at my Aunt's house. I'm really sad and alone, and not doing all that well right now.
But other than all that, I'm doing pretty well. And considering, very superficially happy.

THAT'S MY LIFE. Incredible."

Out of the blue, Adam threw a fit and broke my heart, because I was stupid enough to fall in love with him (I didn't mean to).
Now, I'm going to be moving either back to my mom's (unlikely), moving to Denver, or moving into a house with 3 other guys (most likely).

I'm in Denver right now, getting some parts for my car and having it serviced. My two friends I'm with are with me. It's fun.

And basically the only way to contact me is to write me at:
508 E. Lyon St. Apt. #2
Laramie, WY 82070

or to try my mom at 307.721.2821 and leave a message for me. I haven't had the money to pay off my cell bill.

So basically, I'm doing good overall. Adam breaking up with me is still heavy on my heart, but meh. I'll get over it. Eventually. :)"

"event","So I was having a pretty good day on Monday.

Then it ALL turned around.

I wasn't feeling too happy, so I called up Brian to talk to him about it. So we were at Shari's and then Lynn came over a little later on. I had made some suicidal comments to Brian, and he was rightfully worried about me.
We had all been talking for a while, I was tired and I wanted to go home and get some much-needed sleep.
As I was backing up, I noticed that Lynn was standing behind my car to keep me from leaving. A short while later Brian was there too. I didn't want to deal with that, so I called the cops to have them removed. Well, to say the least, it backfired on me. 

When I was on the phone with the dispatcher, she asked why they were keeping me from leaving, and I was honest and I told her that it was perhaps because I said something about overdosing - though both of them know me enough to know I wasn't serious.

So two police cars show up in the parking lot of Shari's. They talk to the guys, then talk to me. They wanted me to step out of the car, but I refused because I didn't want to see or talk to Lynn or Brian. So I rolled up my window, and locked myself in. Moments later there are two MORE cop cars there, one parked in front of me so I don't take off over the sidewalk. So there's like, 5 or 6 officers talking to people, trying to talk to me and trying to get into my car. I don't know quite what happened then, I just remember letting Lynn in, and then I remember a cop grabbing my arm.

I then freaked out, and tried to get out of his grip, which turned into a brawl. He was pulling me out, I was squirming and then he was hurting me so I punched him with my other hand (right hand) and then he got pissed and was even more rough with me, so Brian started to get mad (he's REALLY protective of me) and then one cop pushed him away from me and I told the cop ""Don't fucking touch him - he has nothing to do with this"". Then they shoved me up against the car, handcuffed me and then searched me down. 
While I was pinned up against the car, they were talking about whether I should go up to the hospital's psych ward, or off to a jail cell. Then one shoved me in the back seat and drove me up to the hospital. 
It was involuntary... obviously. And then I had my blood drawn, was escorted up to the ward with the cop and the handcuffs. I had to take off all my clothes and change into a jumper in front of a nurse. Turned over all my possessions and was stuck alone for nearly two days. 

The doctor finally decided I was fine, and it was just a bad night and I was released this morning. 



My life is just one big, fucking downward spiral."

While we were chatting - and not so quitely most of the time since our views on the war differ greatly - someone was eavesdropping the entire time... and then when we left he gave me a piece of paper with a poem on it, and on the back there was a basic synopsis of our long conversation.

A lot has happened in the past few weeks. 

<u>WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ENTRY</u>

On the 12th, I went to mt doctor's because my eye was pretty swollen from an infection in the lowest (anti-eyebrow) piercing. It had to be taken out and I was prescribed some pretty heavy-duty antibiotics. It hurt reeeeeaaaallly bad coming out.
The next day, the 13th, I woke up and couldn't even see out of my left eye. It was completely swollen shut. I went back to my doctor, and he had me admitted to the hospital. Before I went, I had to remove ALL my peircings because the infection was causing my immune system to target all metal objects. I put a retainer in my lip, but took out all my eyebrow rings, my earrings (now at a 10 gauge) and my nipple rings. Also, when I was at home getting some stuff before going to the hospital, Matt called me from his HOUSE - as in he is back from the Navy. I was happy about that, but mad that I'd have to be in the hospital while he was here.
I spent a total of four (4) days there, I was on IV antibiotics, had a Catscan, had cultures taken from my eye and the holes.. great fun. The infection was serious. If it had gone behind my eye, I had nearly a 70% chance of losing sight, and if it had moved into the muscle, I would have been paralyzed in the left side of my face. It didn't go anywhere other than my eye though. Other than my mom and sisters, Matt was the only person to come and visit me. Thanks.
This is a rather grotesque picture of it: <a href=""http://wyomingben.com/farscry/Mar17041.jpg"">CLICK HERE</a>

After I was released, I spent a decent amount of time with Matt - we basically went to Shari's with Ev...etc. Not much exciting there.
At work everything was going fine, I'm now ready to pierce anything.

The 21st I had an appointment to pierce a lip at 11:30am. I grabbed my supplies (all sterile, of course) and got it done without a hitch. It went so perfectly. I was precise in the puncture, and was very professional... other than the fact I wasn't in a very clean environment. At least my supplies were. I left there, was VERY pumped up and did all my errands. Paid bills, got gas...etc. I stopped at Advance Auto and ordered a new (rebuilt) windshield wiper motor for my car. When I was there, my mother called me saying that the police had just called my house looking for me. My boss at Wyomingben.com called them saying that I had fucked up their website, wiping out all the work I had done on it, because I was mad at them. I got pretty damn mad about that, considering that's a felony charge. I didn't do anything at all. If I had, I would have been proud of it. So, I went over to the office and sat there for 2 hours trying to figure out what the hell happened. Finally, I gave up and called wyomingben's host. They had gone over the 500Meg limit, and the entire site was switched over to another server, therefore deleting the fact that I had made index.html the default and not default.asp. That was it. I talked for a long time over conference calling with guys all over the country to figure that out. Whoo.
After that, I was fine again and Matt and I hung out all day and night.

The 22nd Matt put in the new wiper motor. It didn't work any damn better than the original. So... I thought I had spent $120 for nothing. But, we went back to Advance and they said that I could take it back, and chances were that the problem is in the relays. A normal car has about 4-6 relays. Mine has 24. The manual that the guy at Advance had was wrong about which relays were which, so either I have to get a correct layout of them, or I have to take it to the mechanic. I'd prefer to just get the layout, that way I can fish the relay out, and just replace it if that is indeed what is wrong. It sucks driving in the slush and snow with no wipers. Really.
I was pretty pissed off at everything, so I pierced my lip twice more for the hell of it. I took them out about 30 minutes later.
Later, we all went over to Ev's (we being Matt, Ev, me, Lindsay, her sister Carly, carissa and Eileen) and drank. Later on Jeremy came over and then we all got pretty damn smashed. Not a bad night at all. I loved every minute of it.

The 23rd I was supposed to have off of work because I was supposed to go to Denver that weekend, but I couldn't. But, I wanted to take it off anyway since Matt is here and he's leaving on Wednesday anyway. Well, my boss didn't think that was all that great of an idea. So we had a pretty good falling out, and as far as I know, I'm fired from that job. I was supposed to work today, but I called before I had to go in just to make sure I was still on for today. He said that Terri wanted to talk to me, so I should keep calling to see when she was in... therefore, I'm fired. 
That job lasted long. You know though... I deserve to work with a decent boss. I always end up working for jackasses. I'm worth more than that.

Today I applied for a webmaster position with the forest service. With my experience I should be making about $18 an hour. I won't get that job though. Why? Just because I want it and it would be perfect for me and would provide me with the income to get the hell out of this place. I also got the money back from the wiper motor. Yay.


So that was my entry. How you like?"

"event","I got my first tip today!!! I was proud. A woman and her husband came in, and she said that she needed her belly button ring changed, and that she thought the hole had grown closed a little inside. Since today is Terri's day in Denver, I was the only one there, which was fine... even if she was there I wold have been changing her jewelry anyway. However, as soon as I sat her down, donned my gloves and the ring was finished being sterilized, I noticed that her hole was closed more than just in the middle. I'm not a ""piercer"" yet, so I couldn't just open it back up with a needle (it would've been a lot easier), so I pulled out our handy-dandy tapers, and got that through and then followed through with the jewelry. What is with females and butterflies, anyway?? She gave me a $5.00 tip. Terri doesn't even usually <i>get</i> tips with little piercings like that. 

I'm really psyched about this whole peircing/tattoo thing. I really am. I actually enjoy going to work, and being there. Every time I'm standing through a procedure with Terri, I just want to jump up there and do it myself. I know I'm going to be sooooo good at it. I've never really been so self-confident about something like this. But, the only thing about doing an apprenticeship with Terri is that she doesn't do surface peircings. I really want to specialize in that. When I move on, I really want to do peircings and scarification. I might do some branding, but personally, I'm more interested in the first two.

Props to body modification!!!!"

On Monday or so, I went into Pleasures to get my left nipple ring taken out because it was growing out so badly (it was pierced to close to the surface). Terri and I always talk a lot, and she said that she needed some more help, so I ran over to Terrapin to grab an application and I started work on Wednesday. It's perfect. I really love working there. It's very great experience too, if I want to apprentice later on. So, me and Terri will be going down to the next body mod convention in Co.

Maybe I'll have to get stuck down here for another day. ;) The roads were to bad for me to go see Brett again today (which I REALLY need to do) so I've been bored most of the day that I've been back from Northglenn.
Last night was pretty cool mostly. Jeff had a party at his place, so I went over there after Brett had to get some sleep for work. There was around 10 others there, only one whom I had ever met before, and at that time I didn't like her. Funny how things work. She kept on hitting on me all night, which I didn't mind at all. She reminds me of Josie a lot. And for some reason, perhaps because there was only 3 girls there, I was the damn center of attention the entire fucking time. Maybe it's also 'cause I'm from Wyoming and am an oddity. Well, needless to say I was pretty uncomfortable most of the time when I wasn't drinking or had a damn clove in my hand... my social anxieties were especially bad last night. And this morning I discovered someone stole $80 out of my jacket. I have no money.

I think I'm also going to take some good pictures of my eyebrow to submit to BMEzine.com. Ben at The Blue Door (562 S. Broadway, Denver) even took pictures for his portfolio. Unfortunately for the anti-brow he didn't have a smaller barbell, so it's a 5/8ths inch for now... therefore, the bar is sticking out on both sides. It doesn't look bad, but just not perfect yet. I thought Brett was going to pass out from worry when I got the anti done. Poor baby. :) He wasn't there for the 1st one.

"event","I miss Brett a lot. This is tearing me apart. :(

I had an appointment today at BioLife to have my plasma drawn... after 1 and a half hours of sitting there and getting asked questions...etc, I was denied because of my Fibromyalgia. It's always something, I swear. I'll probably never be a suitable donor; I take too many medications with too high of dosages, I'll always have this damn disease... argh. *frustration*
But then again, I have to look at it from another perspective. Brett has diabetes which sucks 20x more than what I have... lots of people are way worse off than I am. I guess I'm pretty lucky. Meh.

And something else to complain about... my work isn't paying me on time <i>again</i>. You know, a person could get sick of this shit. If they were to transfer my money via PayPal, they would've had to do it 3 days ago.. they didn't. But, also, since I can't transfer any more money from PayPal to my bank account, they will have to take the time (lord knows it's a strenuous process) to write me out a check. 
And speaking of work, I'm now the ""Manager/Web Master"" and I am finally doing the work that I initially took this job for - Flash, graphics and web design.
 Yay for 18-year-old-lucky-with-my-job-and-getting-lots-of-experience-so-I-can-get-a-good-job-in-Denver me!!!!!!!"

Not as hot as my Brett, though. Yay!"

Aurora is about 1.5-2 hours away... better compared to the 4 to Buffalo. Eh! That's not what matters though. I mean, I feel bad about getting together with someone else so soon after Jason and I broke up, but it just feels right. Brett is really putting me in high spirits... which was needed immensely. I was getting pretty sick with depression before.

Anyway, I'm putting up a new site soon. It's http://www.wyomingben.com/farscry temporarily. There's nothing really there though. And that's Brett on the index page, btw."

"event","My mother seems to be pretty supportive of me leaving Laramie and going to Denver. I know I can't stay here much longer. I <i>will</i> revert back to my severe depression and anxiousness.
She understands I hate school and will not be going full time. I'll go probably twice a week, just so they don't drop me (like they did before after 10 days of absence). School just isn't a place for me. I hope college will be. Also, if I go to Colorado soon, I can become a resident sooner, therefore I'll get in-state tuition to Colorado schools.
I think whatever happens, I'll end up working full time for a year (until I get residency) so I can afford an apartment and stuff. I have a lot of experience in most fields of work. I shouldn't have a problem getting a job, right? Even though I have no High School diploma and have piercings and dyed hair? Hahahahaa..."

"event","well, 'm back. and none to thrilled about it. 
i really miss it already. i really miss Brett already. i miss living in civilization. 
i managed to get a crash course in driving in all areas of Denver in not good conditions. w00t! talk about stress. well, at least for the first few trips. after awhile of going from longmont to aurora and back, i got really used to it.

my trip was wonderful. it was very fulfilling... very... filling as well. ;)  *hint, hint, nudge, nudge*
the happiest moment in my life came this weekend. it was good. it was an amazing feeling. in fact, my entire extended weekend was not to be forgotten in anyway. i will always cherish the moments. so many smiles and so much laughter."

1.  Using short cuts to spell words Ex- <i>LilSweet81: ok good cuz i don't feel like doing all those ?s</i>

2. Asking the same question over again only using a different form at least 10 times in an hour.  Ex-<i> Are we there yet?  When are you going to get there? How much longer 'til we get there?  When will we reach our destination?</i>

3.  Being stereotypical.  Ex-<i>All Catholic Priests rape little boys.</i> *fumes*

4.  In a crowd that is walking, stop and turn the other way while everyone is walking in one direction.

5.  Being cocky.  Ex-<i>""I'm so much better than you because I have...""</i>

6.  Telling me that the music I listen to sucks.  

7. Ask me a question, but don't listen to my answer.  Ex-<i>""Lins, what did you do last night?""  ""Well, I went out..."" ""OMG!  Do you have the Spanish homework.  I totally forgot to do it last night?""</i>

7 1/2.  Saying oh my God and totally in the same sentence.

8. Talking in a screaming voice.  Almost like it squeals.

9.  Interrupt me while I'm reading.  

10. Give me a really shitty book and MAKE me read it. Ex-<i>The Scarlet Letter, The Light in the Forest, etc. (pretty much all school books.)</i>
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""if only you knew..."">

So, Kate got all bitchy with me and it was for some naive reason.  So I say, ""Kate, everytime I say something to you, you practically bite my head off.""  She said absolutely nothing.  She didn't say anything.  Didn't look at me.  She did NOTHING!  You would think that if she was my best friend she would at least ackknowledge that I said something.  But she didn't.  I felt like I don't mean anything to anyone.  If my best friend can ignore me, than what do people I don't even know do to me.

Then, with Meghan, she's just been acting so cocky lately.  Extrememly cocky.  I just don't know what to say to her anymore because I probably mean nothing to her too.

In spanish, I just got so paranoid that I was thinking about suicide.  And I finally realized why some kids actually go through with it.  People are just so cruel and they don't think about other people's feelings.  I almost started to cry.   I told Kate and she had no idea what I was going through.  

I have a problem in which I can't express my feelings vocally to people.  If I have a problem with something someone says or does, I just smile and say ""whatever.""  It's really hard for me to tell people what I'm thinking.  I have a lot of things going on in my life that I keep inward and that's not good.  It's just making me stressful.  Sometimes I can barely sleep at night.  

I just wish I knew what to do.

But I'm alive.  Then, my parents take me to see My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  It was pretty damn funny.  But I've seen better movies.

I go to my aunt and uncles's anniversary party.  On my dad's side of my family there's 6 siblings.  We have a big family.  And everyone lives here except my aunt, she lives in Binghamton.  (My cousin is getting married in the spring/summer so I'll be heading down there then)  Then my aunt invites her friends over.  There was a ton of people in her tiny house.  

I ended up with my cousins and the kids that were younger than me in the basement just acting like complete assholes.  The little kids broke out the Tinker Toys, like they always do, and played with them.   They always play this game where the get all these little white crosses out of the container, and set up the containers at the bottom of the stairs, they run up the stair and try to throw the crosses into the container.  It's amusing to watch because they never get it in there.

I played Monopoly.  Dude, I was so winning until I landed on Marvin Gardens with a hotel two times in a row.  I was pissed off.  So I gave my cousin everything I had and I cheated and gave him a shitload of those $500 bills.  He ended up winning.

Ha, my cousin.  His name is Patrick.  He acted really extremely gay until about 2 years ago.  He matured a ton.  He's 2 years younger than me and he's probably my best friend.  He's extremely talented.  He can act.  His dream is to preform on Broadway.  He already scored a  shitload of roles in local theaters around here. I think he'll make it.  He's just a little too young.  I'm really proud of him.

No one understand what I'm saying, or they don't want to understand.  Or they ignore my answer after asking me a question.  

That's probably one of the reasons why I'm friends with Gina.  She truly cares about my well-being and wants to listen to what my thoughts are on the subject.  She might not understand, but at least she tries to make an effort to.  

Practically everyone else who I would classify as a good friend, frankly, doesn't give two shits.  Next time, when they come whining to me about their insignificant problems, I would like to tell them to get a psychiatrist.  


Anywho, I haven't really said anything happening in my life lately.  I've been feeling really tired lately.  I get about 9 hours of sleep each day so I shouldn't be tired all the time.  Damn physical exhaustion, this is going to be the fourth maybe fifth time in about 1 year. 

On a good note, George Masiarz, some guy running for office in Western New York, said that if he is elected, then all students with a B+ or better average will get free college tuition to any NY State University or College.  :D  Free college is awesome!  I talked to the UB guy at college fair (woo :|) and now I think I might wanna go there.  I mean, there are so many choices for majors there in case I don't want to be a pediatrician.

Some girl IMed, she's probably from the JJB, I have no clue, and she asked for html help.

I wrote practically her whole fricken code! And what do I get, absolutely nothing.  She thanks Lissa's and stuff, but if she even went to that site, she could have done her page herself, without me."

"event","Today was a pretty good day.  Nothing terrible happened. I actually feel good too.   

Yesterday, Adam asked me if I was still friends with Gina.  I said yeah, but I said it unsurely.  He's like, what, why don't you like her.  I told him we didn't have common interests.  He was like ""YOU DON""T LIKE SEX?!?' hehe

Today in history class, we spent 40 minutes just talking about the whole Iraq deal.  It was really nice to just sit there and talk about current events.  Of course, I liked it, I'm very opinionated, so I got to debate a lot."

But the good thing is that I will never do that again.  I learn from my mistakes pretty well.

I'm such a dumbass.

DUMBASS! DUMBASS! DUMBASS! DUMBASS!  *kicks her own ass*

Brian!  I thought it was you, but I never thought you would say girlie. lol You are getting into the toughts of a pretty fucked up girl.

If anyone asks me tomorrow how I did I will either a.) break down and cry b.) tell them that I hit someone c.) tell them the truth.  A will probably be the more common answer."

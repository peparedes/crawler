"event","Rockin around the christmas tree have a happy holiday everyone dancin merrily in the NEW...OLD...FASHION WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY...LOL why do these cheery Christmas songs get stuck in my head this time of year?!?!?!?!  Maybe I don't want to rock around the Christmas tree like chestnuts roasting on an open fire.  Or maybe I don't want to have myself a merry little christmas, maybe I want it to suck...I could be one of those people who like to be unhappy...HAHAHA JUST KIDDING!  I love this time of year.  We go to my Aunt and Uncles house and we just have a good time...yeah most of the time there is at least one argument between the adults but us 'kids' look forward to it because it's either about the bible or something really stupid.  We all sit at our own table and laugh.  Thanksgiving was great.  The young ones sat with the adults and us 'young adults' (ranging from age 16 to 28) sat at the other table.  Of course some people at the young adult table thought it would be funny to start cracking dirty jokes and saying all kinds of funny shit and all we did was laugh (see what happens when you take the kids from the kids table...it just gets dirty hahaha).  It was especially funny because my brother's girlfriend and my cousins new husband came to spend the holidays with us for the first time...now they know why we're all insane.  Anyways, I haven't updated in a while but not too much has gone on.  Work is going really good, and dance is looking up, but not much else is worth writing.  Except Matt came home for Thanksgiving and we went to go see a movie.  National Treasure was the name of it.  Pretty good I thought.  It was good to go out and do something, and it was good to see Matt again.  'I see stairs...' hahaha...In other news, I have to go to a memorial service on Saturday, I have to go shopping for something  to wear.  I'm not looking forward to going, but my mom's going with me and my friend alicia is meeting me at my house and we're also going together and maybe my boss's fiance so I won't be alone.  Plus a lot of people I know from dance and school will be there so no one will feel alone.  It's still going to be wicked sad and I know I'm going to cry.  I don't do well at these things..nuh uh not at all.  Oh well I'm going to go and I'm gonna be okay.  Well I must be going because I have some stuff to do...I really gotta keep up with this journal...

Matt: I know you're having troubles down in RI but I just want to tell you Thanks for being there for me.  You are the only one I feel I can tell everything to without being judged or whatever.  You really have been a true friend and I just wanted to let you know!!!!  THANKS AGAIN!!  Since school got out I really haven't talked to anyone from school except you...YOU'RE MY HERO!!

Everytime I have something going on, Julie says ""something came up"" that's her fucking excuse for missing my fucking senior year recital, and my 18th birthday/graduation party.  These fucking things only come around once.  I'm sorry you hate my fucking recital but you could've come and at least shown some support for me since you claim to consider me a sister, but no!  You fucking blow me off and can't even give me an excuse.  I miss a fucking Blink 182 concert that I wanted to go to so fucking bad and my brother even went out and got me tickets.  Then you fucking blow me off for my party and no excuse again just ""something came up"".  Yeah well you're gonna want me around and somethings just gonna come up and see how fucking understanding you are about it.  Courtney and Amanda are the only ones I can seem to talk to.  Tasha hasn't called me back, but I'm sure there is a reason.  There are other people I try and talk to to and it seems like they're avioding me.  I fucking hate feeling like this.  I want to talk to Andres and the other people in the champagne bar but I can't because I'm not on the cruise anymore.  I met the coolest people there and I didn't have to worry about being blown off or worrying about whether those people were actually my friends or not.  But now I have to face reality and it fucking sucks.  School is out for good and the people I thought I'd end up keeping in touch with aren't pulling through.  Well you know what fuck them all.  I'm tired of caring about stupid ass bitches.  If you want to talk to me great, if you don't just say so.  I don't fucking care.  What are the chances of us seeing eachother again.  Maybe once around town shopping or maybe next fourth of July at the fireworks.  That's it.  Oh wow by the looks of this entry I have a slight case of terrets or whatever that is.

"event","Okay, the bus trip from hell...

The bus to Shea Stadium was supposed to leave at three o'clock sharp.  Well we had to wait for the guy who ran the trips friend.  The bus didn't leave until 3:40.  Then there was a huge accident and we had to go a different direction.  We didn't get to windsor until 4:30.  Plus the guy in front of me was really mean to his girlfriend and I wanted to kill the bastard.  The game was supposed to start at 7.  Thank god the game was delayed until 7:50 and we only missed the first inning.  The score was allready Mets 2 Yankees 0~not good!  Our seats were awesome.  We were right on the 1st baseline.  Got some cool pictures too.  Then after the top of the 8th inning the score was like 11-2 or 7-2 or something like that and my dad wanted to get a piece of pizza and I had to go to the bathroom really bad so we left.  When we came back, our whole group was gone!  I grabbed my sweatshirt and we headed to where all the buses were parked thinking the bus and the group would be there.  Oh were we wrong.  So we called this guy and he told us the whereabouts of the group.  He said to look for flashing lights.  We assumed this meant that they were on the bus.  Oh were we wrong again.  We must have passed them twice before the guy said that they weren't on the bus.  So we finally find them and they call the bus driver to find her.  She said she was by the tennis courts and she couldn't even see the stadium from where she was.  So all of us walk to the tennis courts.  No sign of our bus.  Then we end up at the worlds fair and some art museam.  Still no bus.  Well we finally found her three miles away from the stadium.  Why did we have to walk that far?  Because the bus driver was a ditz.  So then these cops offer to escort us to the highway.  I have a tip for all of you, don't listen to NY cops.  He leads us to this street that a compact car could barely go through and we were hitting branches the whole time and barely missed the curb.  Then we stop at a bridge.  The clearance is 10'6, our bus was 11'5.  So now she had to back through the impossible path.  Two people got out to help direct her.  So we sucessfully make it out and the cop leads us to the highway.  Well he led us in the wrong direction.  We ended up at JFK airport and had to turn around.  Well this guy was really rude like when Jay asked for tips for the bus driver this rude dude replies 'I have a tip for ya, get us home'.  Then when we passed the stadium again to head home he starts yelling and swearing 'is that the fucking stadium again, what the hell'.  It's like hey asshole guess what, we said that 20 minutes ago.  Then I wanted to sleep on the way home and Jay and this bus driver had a little convorsation the ENTIRE RIDE HOME!  And believe me they aren't quiet talkers.  At 2:30 we finally get home!  OMG what a night.  And that my friends and fellow LJ members, is the bus trip from hell.  Wow that was a long story!

"event","Sorry about the ""fest 04"", Matt got me started on that.  Let me tell you, this weekend was full of tears.  Kalyn cried watching the senior number and my solo on Saturday (the first show) and everyone but me and Kim (including most of the people backstage and in the audience) were crying.  We felt kind of insensitive.  I almost cried when we did the surprise number, Nancy's face was priceless.  Oh but I cried when I screwed up my solo and everyone was like ""it was great and making a big deal to cheer me up.  Then came Sunday!  The dance with our dads, oh wow tears galore!  I barely made it past the first step.  I look in the pit and Kathy is holding her head hysterically crying along with Nancy.  I was the first one to cry.  I still get choked up thinking about it...oh well.  Then I messed up in lyrical, I did the stag spins to the back instead of the front...opps! lol.  I messed up a little in my solo but I didn't let it bother me.  Then Cassandra is hysterically crying giving me flowers, so there come the tears again.  I even started when Lauren did her solo.  Then when I thought it was all over, we came out with the seniors and they gave a speech to Kathy and Chelsea could barely talk she was crying so bad...and you guessed it, here come the water works!  Then when the closing song was done, Vikki looks at Sam Lauren and I and starts crying too.  I was just like 'don't look at me'.  I don't understand why I was so emotional, or anyone else.  I'm coming back next year and they all know it.  Kathy and Nancy would never let me leave.  Nancy even wrote something to me that said 'you better be there on Tuesdays'...hehehe I'm in trouble now with a Nancy threat.   Oh and get this: I won free dance lessons for selling the most tickets...what the hell am I going to do with them?  I'm cutting down on the classes I take and I teach so I already get a discount.  I went on stage and was like 'I guess I have to come back now' she laughed and made a joke to the audience so they all knew what I said.  It was all fun though and I give anything to do it all again.  Except see Nicole at Nancy's party.  She successfully pissed me off.  I just wish I could tell her what a bad influence she is on the nicest of people.  Oh well as long as I never have to see her face again.  Oh but the partners in trouble had their share of laughs!!!! ahahahaha I can't even begin to tell you!  Oh well...My weekend was obviously a tear fest...some mom actually told me if I wasn't coming back she and this other mom were pulling their kids.  She said it's always the good ones who leave.  It was so sweet.  Everyone is so sweet to me, since everyone frickin knows me!! hehehe.  Wow I wrote a lot!

Then people were just throwing balls around.  Then Depino told us to stop because the bell was about to ring and I kinda hit him...opps!  Well in other news I got a 71 on my physics test...the lowest one this year!  Not too good.  Then I found out that Sam didn't put Heather and my name on the Six Flags thing so who knows what I get for a grade.  I could possibly be screwed...this is why you don't listen to other people who don't know what they are talking about (cough cough heather) I'm not mad at her or anything but damn...I hope we don't fail.  I'll be wicked pissed.
Oh yeah, we listened to Blink today at dance...I just laughed...dance sucked ass!!  It was so stressful I wanted to shoot myself.  And of course Chelsea had graduation practice, Nancy was sick, Sharon wasn't there, Kim didn't come until the last two classes so the first two were the worst, and Kathy was dealing with parents.  This devil kid Jason took a swing at me today and he's lucky his dad took him out long enough for me to cool off because I would've screamed at him.

Wow waking up at four am for competition sucks!  It's all good because it was pretty fun.  We got Second place gold for Against the World (jazz), First place gold and a butterfly wing award for a kickline in Let's Get Loud (tap), First place gold for Come'n Get It (jazz), and Second Place gold and Butterfly Wings Award for potential for God Bless This Child (lyrical)  yay! go us!  Our studio won some Butterfly Award for Potential (I guess that's a nice way of saying we suck but at least we tried.  All our other girls did great and I'm so proud to be a teacher.  This girl I teach her name is Ashley she did an improv which means she picked a number and they played that song and she made up a dance at the top of her head.  It was awesome and she's only 7!!  It was the coolest thing ever, everyone cheered her on.  YAY AGAIN FOR OUR STUDIO AND ALL OF US IN COMPETITION.  The only bad part besides me messing up wicked bad (people said they didn't notice except tap) was when Melissa almost died three times because the metal pole holding up the red abyss kept falling on her.  I tried to catch the pole once and smaked her in the face.  Oh yeah and I hope Chelsea's foot heals and she'll be able to dance.  Unfortunately she was unable to perform in the competition.  Oh well we still love her.  Then there were these freaks that performed it was creepy but cool all in the same.  They did something called zombie nation, haunted lullaby, black widow, and I don't remember what the other one was but it was to an Evanessence song and they wore chains.  I heard they were teachers and should'nt have been in our category.  I mean I teach but that's a different story because my group in whole doesn't dance more than 2-3 hours a week.  Oh well I think we still beat them in something hehehe lol. Eh I'm seeing blurry...time to sleep now...

Then came jazz, we worked so hard I was about to pass out from lack of oxygen.  I asked my mom to get me some water, so what does she do...go outside and talk to my friend and her mom.  I come out there barely able to talk like bugging her over and over for some water...then I still had lyrical and seniors which was okay.  Next week she decided that jazz and lyrical need to be extended so I get home at 930 instead of 9, but at least there will be no seniors and then I'd end up comming home at 10.  wow!  At least I have my water now!!  Lol gotta go to bed

LOL wow...Well I'm going to the prom with my friend Josh~I can't believe that I never thought of him!  Oh well I feel bad for the short notice but he doesn't mind...now that I'm going broke for a stupid school dance, hehehe jp.  Anyway, I have no complaints today except for why the hell do I have such weird moments...I mean like one minute I'm fine and the next I want to go to bed and never ever wake up, or I'll want to like yell at people for no apparent reason.

I really want to get out of school!

"event","Well last night was horrible.  My parents bought my teachers taco bell because she offered to pick something up.  Well the last time I had taco bell I was wicked sick so I didn't get anything.  Well my parents went out and forgot to get something for their only daughter who was at dance from 3:15 past 9:30, but at least offered to take me somewhere.  Well I didn't want to because it was allready ten o'clock and I haven't been in bed before eleven all week.  So I went to bed without dinner, which made my mom feel wicked bad but hey it happens.  I didn't sleep at all anyway becasue my neck hurt so bad I couldn't breathe...so I just had to sit up and wait for an ice pack to be cold enough to be helpful...not fun.  It gave me a chance to realize just how much I'm dreading prom.  The three people that I would probably hang out with all have a different circle of friends...well that's fine but when I'm with them and their friends I feel like I don't belong there.  So I'm pretty much going to be on my own, and I don't have a date so I'm fucked.  But Melissa Cilley is going and we were planning to hang out a little, but her boyfriend doesn't even know me so who knows how that'll go.  Things would be easier if I had a date, but I'd rather go with a guy friend then someone else because then it's like it's not as much pressure.  okay enough about prom.

I forgot to call out of dance today so I had to go.  OMG chaos!!  The first class wasn't too bad.  They were a little rambunctious or whatever but it was allright...then came class two.  I was doing a make up lesson for this girl and after that's done I go and help Chelsea.  Well kids are hanging upside down on the bar, and doing cartwheel and summersalts on the hard floor, and they wouldn't stop!!  That was just ballet.  Then came acro.  I was talking to one of the moms to find out what her daughter was comming to make up, then I walk into the dance room and no teachers are there and kids are running in circles.  Kathy was talking to some parents who kept asking questions, Nancy was talking to the new girls mom because today was her first class, and Chelsea was chasing down a girl who walked out.  Some girl came up to me crying because she couldn't find her friend~and neither could I!  I couldn't just leave the class all alone so I just quickly looked in the waiting room and she wasn't there, so I was starting to freak out.  Then I found she was in the bathroom.  Turns out this boy somehow snuck into the parking lot!  And this isn't the first time he's done this but since the last time we've kept a real close eye on him.  I wanted to pull out my hair, one thing after another.  But the worst was yet to come.  This four year old told Kathy to shut her fat ass up.  Then he told Nancy not to tie his shoe because he hates her, but she tied it anyway and he shrieked and Kathy yelled at him.  He stuck his tounge out at Kathy then Nancy.  He was so close to Nancy he almost licked her...wow what a day!!  Chelsea and I decided we should get a special award for putting up with this crap that no one else does except Kathy and Nancy but it's worse for us because we're always teaching.  They sometimes are doing other things.  At least the last class is good.  Well three out of four classes I was taking technique make-ups.  I did every group except mine, but I did my group last night.  Holy shit I just rambled on and on today...lol

This guy in my civics class said that it really made him think, he's drank and driven, or not worn a seatbelt, and it's not worth it...I think everyone should have that assembly, and they should definately return.  Other than that, I've been really depressed.  It has taken a lot to not break down in tears...I was walking back from the assembly and I found myself fighting back tears...then again between 6th and 7th.  And I think I was a bitch to Matt I'm not really sure...I was kinda mean to Sam and I feel so bad.  Matt~if I was a bitch I'm really sorry and please think nothing of it.  Just because I'm down doesn't mean I can take it out on others...Sam and I allready talked about it and we're okay so I'm not as worried, she just thought I was mad at her...I was late for dance and Kathy gave me attitude because I told Kristina and Ashley I might not go because I have a lot of homework, and I didn't call her and tell her.  Well I didn't call her because I was pretty intent on going.  Oh well I have no regrets and I'm not sorry I kept messing up today.  If I didn't have so much stress and so much going on maybe I wouldn't have messed up in every single class today.  I have never done so bad at dance class EVER!!

Then came Fame which she flew through teaching it~everyone was lost.  Then came teachers which I've never been so confused in my life.  Me and this girl Alicia have a separate part cuz we're full time and I didn't know where to go and it just got wicked confusing...she's gonna teach us Chicago and I'm gonna colapse on the floor from overload...oh and I went with Lauren R to McDonalds to get a drink and these guys were like ""hey ladies"" and she's like shut up don't mess with me""  hahaha sometimes she can be kinda cool.  Then we saw Lisa Beaupre and she was talking to us and then some guy asked Lauren ""How old is u?""  and she's like 16 and he's like ""ur legal""...then we walked away and she's like screw you I have a boyfriend...hahaha anyway...I gotta gizzle, watching a movie with my madre and then off to bed for school.

I mean, one minute I'm happy or hyper or whatever just in a good mood.  Then the next minute I'm wicked pissed or upset and just wish I could go to bed and never wake up.  It's weird because a lot of my friends always tell me there problems, but I never know who to talk to when I'm feeling down.  It's like I don't want them to judge me even though they won't because they're my friends.  IDK maybe I just don't want people to worry about me or maybe I want them to think I'm happy.  To be honest, I really don't know why I do anything I do.  It sounds weird but I don't know why I make the decisions I do, or say the things I say.  It's also funny that I try to hide my feelings and people always seem to know somethings wrong.  Sometimes they ask, or try to cheer me up, and sometimes it seems like they try to just leave me alone...oh and another thing, I've been feeling...well...lonely I guess.  I feel like I'm always by myself...and the guy issue...we're not even going to go there.  I've given up on the guy I like, I mean he probably knows I like him and he just doesn't wanna say anything because he doesn't like me back...that has to be it.  God I can't even get through one day without mentioning him on my journal...I really am pathetic...okay I need to change the subject now.  Hahahaha Jessica Simpson is on TV someone said they thought she was pretty...I think she looks like a duck!!  I guess she is kinda pretty, besides I shouldn't talk about people and there looks, I have no room to talk...but it's okay, I'll live lol.

Ya know as much as I write in here I don't really get the point.  Why would you write about personal stuff that's posted on the internet for people to read?  Now everyone who reads this is going to want to know who I'm talking about.  Then I might tell them and they'll either say how gross he is or encourage me to ask him out, and make me think I actually have a chance when I'm pretty sure we're never gonna be more than friends.  Then I'll probably say something to him and get hurt again.  Same old story every time.  I should write a book, although I'm allready working on an autobiography for Nancy.

Oh yeah and that was at 7 AM...then I went back to bed and slept till 11~I had the weirdest dream that I was hanging out with Dan outside of school!  How scary...I thought I really hung out with him and I was like dam what am I thinkin!  LOL, just replace him with a better guy hehehe ya know who I'm talking about...actually most of ya'll don't (did I just say ya'll?!)  Everyone has been asking my mom if I have a boyfriend and she keeps saying no and I keep thinking, yeah not many people in this school are 'boyfriend material' and the ones who have potential don't appear to like me beyond a friend...dam! LOL anyway...work was interesting, Kathy called the trampolines tramps and it made me laugh because I can hear these little three year old comming up to their parents and bein like ""mommy mommy I jumped on the tramp today"" hahahha anyway I'm gonna stop for now.

"event","Today was so much fun!  In spanish we did our ""cascarones"" and we played a game.  Me and my psychic friend Jeremy laughed so hard we were crying...Nick got germ boy good!! muahahaha dam I'm so mean.  Then Wally ""You really got that shit wedged in there""  Hahahah OMG I had too much fun.  I went to all 3 lunches because we had a party in Marketing...so I actually didn't go to the cafe except to look for someone...and I had lunch with my partner in crime Sammy!!  Then I went do dance (surprise surprise) which was fine not too much attitude today...Kathy's granddaughter Taylor was there...she's so damn cute! lol, then I read something that made me happy then sad!!  All I can say is ""WHY ME?!?!"".  Oh and Tuesday I tripped over my own shoe in jazz, and UCONN WOMEN WON!!  Yay and the men won the day before!  Dam ""I'm proud to be a Connecticutan where at least we win b-ball"" lol, I should be a LEE GREENWOOD impersonator...except I'm not a man!  Then I woke up yesterday and couldn't move...I slid off my bed and sat on the floor for about five minutes.  Then at senior practice my dad decides to pick me up and spin me in a circle instead of doing what he was supposed to do which is hold my leg in an arabesque (however it's spelled) and slowly turn me in a circle.  But no, he had to scare the crap outta me.  I screamed then he put me down and I was sitting on the floor while everyone was laughing!  And Kathy rescheduled my solo practice but it's aight cuz she gave it to my sista Sammy!!  This will give her more time to give mine some umph! lol.  Oh and now  Sam and Kristina keep telling me to tell ""him"" how I feel but I don't think I can...I don't want to ruin our friendship...man my life sucks...well not really...besides I really don't think he has feelings for me and I don't wanna make an ass outta myself, plus I have a little thing called FEAR OF REJECTION!  I know...have no fear, there's nothing to fear but fear itself""  but who cares I'm still terrified to say anything!!  Wow I wrote a whole lot of madness!  Anyway time to get back to the outside world lol

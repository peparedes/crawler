"event","I'd like to make an apologetic statement to you all.




I'm sorry I had a creative idea for a movie that I thought was amazing.  I'm sorry you didn't understand my idea.  I had an idea that I wanted to show to you all.  None of you really paid attention.  I NEVER said that this IS what our movie is going to be, I said this is what I think it should be and I decided to share it with you all.  My mistake, it'll never happen again.

"event","I got to talk to Bob (another one of my friends from Billerica... he kinda IMs me every know-and-then but doesn't really have a reason lol... oh well, its good to talk to him).  So I asked him how Karen is and what's happened with the whole insident.  He told me that she DID break up with Anthony.  That's great news.  Not so much for me cuz she'll probably be dating John now, but I'm glad to hear that she's at least safe.

"event","<P>OH MAN!!! SO MUCH MEAT!!! I went to the <STRONG>Rib and Brew Fest</STRONG> in Lowell this afternoon.&nbsp; So much barbeque and just mmmmmmmmmmmm. There was a really good band there too.&nbsp; They did all cover-songs, like Lynnard Skynnard, Nickleback, Creed, Maroon 5(not so great with the vocals but still good), ZZ Top, and a couple others.&nbsp; I don't remember what the band name was though.&nbsp; They had a great lead guitarist but the dumbasses running the system didn't have him turned up enough so noone could here him play his solos... or anything else for that matter.&nbsp; But whatever he was playing, he looked cool doin it... and that's all that really matters........ actually that's a lie... I wanna hear.&nbsp; So anyways.&nbsp; Lots of food, kinda pricy for BBQ but w/e my parent's money lol.</P>
<P>Ok well I'm gonna go head down to the courts for a little practice and such... yeah still by myself cuz noone else is cool enough to join me</P>

"event","I guess you could call this a reality check.  Its like one of those moments when you go ""what if i had done this"" maybe it wouldn't have turned out this way.

Well, it all has to do with Karen and some kids I know from Billerica.  I don't wanna say too much because I don't know how much I'm supposed to actually tell people, but some serious shit might happen.  I can't help but wonder if it would've been different if I had told her how I feel... if I had ask her out.

I know I'm probably confusing you.  You don't really know what's going on.  I'll tell you about it if you IM me, but I won't post it all here....




Well, in other news, I went to see the Varsity and JV Field Hockey today.  Interesting sport, I think I prefer watching it on ESPN, like during the olympics.

Speaking of the olympics... Sports that should be an Olympic Sport and sports that should NOT be an olympic sport

SHOULD:
Paintball
Lacrosse


Should NOT:
Badminton
Ping Pong (although I did find it amusing to watch)


Oh, and I also am very excited to find out that Handball IS an olympic sport... maybe I can make it to the olympics after all ;)

"event","OK, so I finally got my senior proofs a couple days ago.  Not too bad.  I got some in my maroon shirt and tie, some in my blue shirt and green tie, and then with my guitar.

Yup so I'm ordering prints soon.  If anyone wants/needs a wallet size print let me know soon so I know how many I need to order.

Ok, well I'm sure my entries WILL get longer when I get used to this whole thing... or when I have a good story to tell... or somethin... CIAO!

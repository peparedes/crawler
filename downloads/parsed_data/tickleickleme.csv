"event","Ok so last night i was soo emotional.. As a matter of fact I have been that way for a while now which is weird for me.. Eric and I got into a fight today and actually sat down to talk it all out.. It worked out for the best for us to talk about it cuz what always happends is i bottle up what is bothering me and then just blow up on him in the end.. So we talked and there is going to be a lot of changes in our relationship.. One of the biggest ones is we are going to talk. 

It really sucks to not have friends and be all alone all the time.. It hurts when i have to sit at home and do nothing if eric is going out with the guys and stuff.. I feel like im makin him feel bad for me by getting upset that he wants to hang out with his friends which is not fair to him.. He should be able to have friends and a girlfriend and i understand that.. I just with i had my old life back.. I just want to be able to have fun just sitting around with the friends like the good old days instead of working my ass off just to be able to have like an hour of fun that i have to pay for.. Its really hard to be older and im being to regret ever wanting to be older.. I mean im stuck.. Im only 18 which means i can buy my own ciggarettes and i can get lotto tickets and rent porn but i still cant go to bar with my bf or n e thing that older people do.. So for so long i wanted to be 18 and be able to do whatever i want but its not much different then being 17 cuz i still cant drink and have fun like the people older than me do.. Its just like being stuck in limbo.. I dont want to hang out with the people who are younger cuz they ask if i can buy ciggs for them but the people older i have to ask to buy beer for me lmao.. SOO STUPID! 

All i really want is my old life back were i had a million people to call to hang out and i never had a dull moment.. 

Man it felt good to get all that out! lol...

Im going to a concert on the 11th!!! Less than jake!!! Im so excited but i hurt my back so i cant stand in the front which really sucks.. We'll see tho!! 

Ok well im gonna go for now! Thanks for reading!!

"event","I have been up way too long.. Im so tired but i have so much on my mind not even my meds can help me sleep tonight.. Its 5am and im thinking about bills, moving, the whole boyfriend situation.. (my bf is driving me NUTS!) and sooo much more...

It all started about 3 weeks ago.. I started having a strange pain in my back.. Well 2 weeks later the pain had gotten so bad that i couldnt even get up from my bed.. Mom rushed me to the hospital at 4am and they said i sprained my back.. Im now on two pain killers and a muscual relaxer.. The pain isnt n e better when im not on my meds either.. so i dont know what the fuck im gonna do when i run out...

Then... 

My dad called me 3 nights ago about 8pm.. I was at work. He was in the back of a cop car on his way to spend the next 3 months in jail for being the fucktard he is... I was standing in the fitting rooms at work trying not to get caught by a manager for talkin on my phone.. It was kinda hard considering i was crying.. Ok i take that back more like sobbing... I had to take a break to have a ciggarette and think about the shit that had just been dropped on me.. Its so hard to think about how things are now when they were so perfect 3 years ago..

The whole bf situation is so messed up i dont know what to do about it.. I love my bf with all my heart dont get me wrong its just i want to be treated better.. Is that so much to ask? I want to know he wants me and i dont feel like he does half the time.. Plus im getting all worked up about his ex gf situation.. That bitch drives me fucking insane. Whenever her name is even said i get all weird.. This has never happened to me before but then again i have never dated a guy who still has his ex on his phone plan and constantly lets her fuck him over... I dont know.. She thinks its none of my business but what happeneds to my bf and his money i believe is my business.. Exspecially when we cant go out cuz he doesnt have money due to her pure stupidity... Man that women is fucking stupid..

So n e ways.. I have been working a lot which is good cuz i sure as hell need the money... Too many bills and not enough money coming in to get them all paid... Who woulda thought that when i tured 18 i would have so many bills already?! NOT ME!!! Oh well its life and im getting back handed full force by reality.. 

Thats all for now.. Thanks for reading!

"event","So i quit my job at Family Christian stores last week... I had it all planned out.. I was going to walk in there, hand my manager my notice and go to work.. Well she wasnt there so i set it on her deak.. She came in later and asked me to come to her office.. I wrote this letter so i wouldnt have to talk to her cuz i knew she would ask me a million and 1 questions and i didnt want to put up with it n e more. WHOA boy was i right! She asked me five million questions and was NOT satisfied with n e of my answers!!! I was like WTF i quit ya know?! 

Well after telling me how great of an employee i am and totally kissing my ass she talked me into staying there to work only one day a week.. Pretty pointless if u ask me because I only get like a 3-4 hour shift n e ways so its almost not even worth the trip... So I chose to stay on wendsdays... She has me on schedule for the next 2 saturdays?!?!?! WTF and NO WENDSDAYS!!!! WTF!!!!!! Shes so dumb! So im like seriously done. I dont want to work there AT ALL n e more..

~*~*Anywho*~*~

Im going to the mall with Chrissy tomorrow... Not that i have n e money just going to hang out i guess.. Umm.. Yeah.. It should be kool. I just want to get the fuck outa this house for real its making me SICK! So yeah its kool to be able to go and get out of my house!

I have been screwed over by very close friends.. It has been a tough ride. Sometimes i just want to give up and say forget everything!!! But i know it is in my best interest to stay on track and try to make the best of myself! Im trying to keep strong but its hard at times. 

So I made a big mistake.. I went out of my way to do a favor for someone i thought was a friend... and it got thrown in my face... But what do i expect for being nice to a liar? SO MUCH DRAMA!!!

So i am an independent beauty consultant now so if n e one wants a free facial let me know!!!! YAY !!! 

Well i have nothing more to write right now!! So i will come back to this later.. Bye all :)

"event","So it has been a while since i wrote in here again.. It seems like time has been working against me latley.. Its like once I get a day off to just relax its over in an instant and im working again. So for thanksgiving I went to PA to visit Jons sister Chrissy and her fiance Ron.. I had a great time.. I wish we could have stayed longer so we didnt have to sit in the car again! Naw but it was a kool trip.. To be honest with u PA is a lot different than Illinois... I liked it tho.. Yeah so we got a hotel room that had a indoor pool so everyone was up at 9am to go swimming but i took a shower instead lol.. I felt bad tho cuz we didnt get to eat at rons grandparents house after his poor grandmother slaved over the stove to make us all a night dinner. I thought it was kool getting to hang out with Chrissy tho cuz i talked to her on the phone a lot and it was my first time to actually meet her. At first I was REALLY nervous but the second i walked in the door I kinda felt like I was visiting an old friend  Well then i came back here to the sucky town i live in and got a second job  its kinda hard sometimes cuz if im not working one job im working the other and i dont get a break for the next 12 days... Once again i had to work a double at Adventure trails and I got writen up for not taking my garbage around. I honestly forgot cuz im not used to having to do that im used to the outside guys coming and stealing it.. But i have to keep myself going. I want a car and right about now i will do almost anything to get it. Like spend all my money on christmas!!! HAHAHA! Oh well after christmas it should be easier to save.. SO I THINK... But im also paying for my birthday party!!!! Im paying for it cuz i want a nice 18th birthday and my mother cant afford it so I am leaving it up to myself!!! So I hope everyone who goes has a great time!!!! So yeah its getting late I think maybe I should rap this up for now.. I will try to keep blogs going!!!

The only thing i did do was lay aorund in my night clothes and talk on the phone lol. Well saturday was like the worst day ever. I broke a lot of my familys good dishes and half my family is mad at me for it. I ened up breaking this one plate that had a picture of my brother and sister when they were little kids and its irreplaceable so they are like super sad about that. I mean i felt really bad for breaking it but it wasnt my fault. You all are probably thinking i did it on purposse but i didnt. I thought our cabnit was a one peice and i pushed on the top half knocking all off the dishes onto the floor. If that isnt bad enough i ended up stepping on some little peices when i was trying to get my sewing machine out of the kitchen. So then i was hand sewing this one thing for a friend and the needle ended up going into my leg. WOW DID THAT HURT LIKE A BIATCH! It was horrible i cried like no other! It still kinda hurts. Its all purple and blue. Total sickness. Yeah so all that happend and then i hear that someone close to me is mad at me and i totally hate it when people are mad expecially ppl i care about. Well me and her talked about it and its all a big misunderstanding............... Well now im sitting here in 4th hour doing nothing waiting till 2:15 so i can go home!!! I have a meeting at adventure trails at 6pm and I will have to watch a movie and take a test. wish me luck! Buhbye! ~**Nikki**~"

50 or less: Thanks for answering honestly. Now get yourself a shrink, quick!

51-70: When it comes to understanding human emotions, you'd have better luck understanding Chinese.

71-90: You've got more emotional intelligence than the average frat boy. Barely.

91-110: You're average. It's easy to predict how you'll react to things. But anyone could have guessed that.

111-130: You usually have it going on emotionally, but roadblocks tend to land you on your butt.

131-150: You are remarkable when it comes to relating with others. Only the biggest losers get under your skin.

150+: Two possibilities - you've either out ""Dr. Phil-ed"" Dr. Phil... or you're a dirty liar.</td></tr></table>

I kinda wish sometimes that all people thought the same way and had the same feelings about things as i do. I mean im not saying im right about everything or n e thing along those lines. All i know is  there is a lot of things that can hurt a lot of people and its honestly disturbing to think that so many people can get hurt by one mistake. It scares me cuz i have a GUT FEELING something bad is gonna happen to me or someone close to me really soon and its not good at all... Im really scared about this cuz it is a strong feeling.

"event","Grrr to most guys. Well it all started when Nikki (one of my best friends) made plans to go hang out with this guy that i kinda like... I wasn't mad about it at all, i mean i understand they are friends and im not gonna tell her who she can and cannot be friends with. I dont even mind them being friends....Then she tells me they are gonna go to the mall to talk about some stuff..Im like thats really kool ya know. Then i asked if i could go and she said ""no offence to you but i kinda just wanna talk to him alone.."" so im like yeah thats fine but its weird cuz she usually lets me go with her whenever she is with n e other guy... Well she pretty much rubbed it in my face today at school that she is going with him...So im just like whatever... Then i find out they arent going to the mall that they are going to the movies.... OKKKK who talks in a movie?!?! Sounds like a date to me... I mean WTF. I cant really be mad cuz hes like not my bf or n e thing but he kissed me the first day he met me so im DYING to know what they are REALLY doing....Im done i give up.
Ok so that was just the begining.... I called my ex danny.. He was being a total ASSHOLE. He said he doesnt wanna talk to me n e more... im like "" we are supposed to be friends how could u not wanna talk to me n e more?!?!"" he says "" I just dont feel like talking to u n e more"" so im like WTF dude. ASSHOLE i swear. Im gonna refer to him as asshole from now on... so n e who asshole hung up on me!!!! I cant freakin stand it when assholes hang up on me. It bugs the SHIT out of me. GRRRRRR. So right after that my friend Justin came over... We watched a little bit of the rocky horror picture show but he didnt like it so i put the grude in... good movie till the end. lol. But yeah then he just like up and left. Weird. I got a message from rob saying he wore the same shirt today as he did to rocky on saturday and it smelled like me.... he even put a drewling face. WTF can u say WIERD?!?! lol So yeah my day pretty much sucked ass for the most part. I think the only good part about today will be when im sleeping that way nothing to bad can happen. Knowing my luck it will tho.. Oh well im done caring about n e thing n e more all ui ever get is fucked over by dumb assholes who dont see the real me. The End."

So yeah Justin is coming over today after school. Nikki is going with chris to the mall after school and megan is most likely gonna come chill with us for a little while. Hehe. So yeah im bored here in this class... We have work but I have done a lot and im too lazy to do n e more right this second. Last night my washer got messed up somehow so my whole basement was full of water...AHHH it was kinda scary hehe. I cant wait till this class is over so i can go home and chill with my friends w00t w00t!! hehe. I talked to my friend Jenny last night on the phone for the first time since she moved to washington (about 4 months)! I was so excited to talk to here and we exchanged addresses so we can keep in touch! Oh.. Last night around 11pm the phone rings and of course everyone thinks its gonna be for me (cuz my friends call late when they know they arent supposed to) LOL but n e who it was these little kids that have been calling my house for 3 weeks now. They prank call us about 4 times a day but it eased up for a  week. Well they called again last night and my sister was having an actual convo with them. The one boy was calling here a stupid white hoe and crap like that and my sister just kept sitting there laughing at him!! It was freakin hilarious. I mean these little kids are freakin stupid for doing it cuz we have the little tracker on our phone right now. My sister keeps saying ""i cant wait to be there when ur mama beats ur ass"" and i honestly cant wait to see what these little idiots look like!!

Ok so we sat there me, rob, and nikki and we talked for a little while.... then megan came over so nikki left and megan hung out with us for a while! We all had some fun atleast even tho we were SUPER bored. Well then i kinda notice rob is hitting on megan a little. Might i add that Rob is a very nice not too bad looking guy. I mean he is awesome. but n e who i kinda noticed a little flirting and what not and then around 11:30 he leaves for home. Well me and megan are walking to megans to get her stuff so that she can stay the night with me tonight and she tells me that i might not wanna get my hopes up with him cuz he said he doesnt know if he likes me. Ok so that kinda hurt my feelings a little cuz i was under the impression we hit it off pretty well.... well then i get online to see that he is logged in.. so i start talking to him and i bring up today and i was like ""so what do u honestly think of me"". Pretty much knowing the answer... he says ""i think we would be kool friends... i dont know about more.. but who knows..."" and im like pretty much shot down ya know. So im just like yeah thats kool im kool with that (which i am). and then he goes on to ask if megan ask about him at all. and i said "" how come i have the feeling u dont like me cuz u like megan..?"" and he said ""i hate to say it, but its true...."" WTF. Megan is a great girl and if i was a guy i would wanna be with her too but its like im really big on giving people chances and its like he spent 8 hours with me and already decided that im not romantic enough for him, that im not girly girly, and that he is ""to comfortable"" with me. UM OOOOOOK. It just gets kinda old when ur whole life u are always second best to ur best friends. Its not that much fun. I mean im not writing this cuz im looking for a pitty party cuz i want that in that least. As a matter of fact i dont want that at all. I am jsut writing how i feel. So yeah. It just kinda hurts my feelings but for some reason i have a feeling this whole better friends thing doesnt just have to do with n e of the reasons he gave me. Like with most other guys its just cuz they are too scared to admit that they are not physically attracted to me. Oh well his loss i guess. I mean i say that every time a guy says that to me but honestly i haevnt grown to believe it...Ok well im off to bed. *hug* ~**Nikki**~"

We will be good friends i know this just by a feeling in my stummy! No but he is kool! SO yeah Im sitting here in my loud house trying to hear my music but all i can hear is the baby crying. Megan is gonna come over in a little while to hang out so i dont have to be bored while i watch austin! I love hanging out with megan! I also love hanging out with nikki but i think its kool how megan will come over. Last night me and megan were hangin out and I had asked her to pluck my eyebrows. OUCH! lol I hate that feeling its sooooooo uncomfortable! But they look awesome! Im a dork im all getting excited over my eyebrows. (w00t w00t) lol. Well i called Danny today... I was just straight up with him, I said that it feels weird to talk to him now cuz he seems like he doesnt wanna talk to me n e more. He said its not true that he does wanna talk to me but i know something is up. I mean if he does have a new gf great for him. I cant really complain cuz i have done my fair share of flirting since we broke up. I dont see n e possiblity of us getting back together. I thought long and hard about it but there is just to much about him that i DONT like. I mean i like how we cuddle and some other things but i lied to myself to try to make him out to be the best guy for me but i know now hes not... not at all. So n e who im single and lovin it for now. I really like someone to be there to cuddle with and stuff but I dont NEED that. I think that is the main thing i miss is cuddling and kissing! But oh well i got my friends and family and thats all i need right now. Im happy with where my life is right now for the most part. There is a couple things if i could change right now i would but i cant. School is going fairly decent. The only bad thing is i have a lot of tests tomorrow.

I hope no one is mad at me about n e thing that happend last night. I wanted to keep my distance and stay out of the whole situation but its kinda hard when ur 2 best friends are sisters. Its a huge problem for some and a not so huge problem for others. I can see where both sides come in tho. I just dont want n e one to be mad at me about n e thing that has happend. I talked to Chris on the phone last night for about 30 mins. I dropped all my problems on him. (nothing that has to do with n e one else). I really shouldnt have cuz i feel kinda shitty about it. I mean i dont feel shitty i just think i bored him with what all i have on my mind. he gave me a lot of good advice on my subjects tho. I just dont know what i want or need n e more. so much shit is going on and its hard to explain.

The only bad thing is trying to get all the rice out of my ass crack from Megan LOL!! So yeah i met a couple new people which was kool!! Plus i got a chance to hang out with people i already know which is even kooler! The only bad thing that happend last night was I found out that someone i like being friends with wont be my friend if i hang around with this one guy who i find very interesting and i enjoy hanging out with, I mean i know he hates him but I dont see why he wont be friends with me. I have been thinking about it a lot and if thats how this person is gonna be maybe he doesnt wanna be my friend as bad as i would like to be his. This guy is awesome to hang around with and gives the best hugs, but i just dont get his train of thought. I can understand where hes coming from i just dont see where he is going. I woke up this afternoon and went over to megans! Me, megan, nikki, and tammy all went out to Coyote Canyon to have dinner!! There food there was freakin awesome!! On the way home me and Nikki were laying in the back of the van and Nikki had layed her head on my chest and had fallen asleep for a little while. While she layed there i played with her hair and i just sat there thinking about what i want and whats best for me right now. I mean am i actually starting to like Illinois?!?! Is this where i wanna be?! Do i really not wanna go back to az? I mean i would lose so much if i went back now. I would lose my 2 best friends (meagn and nikki) which i love with all my heart, I would lose all my friends who i have come across since i moved here, and i would lose all my family like i did when i moved there to begin with. I just dont know what i want n e more and it kinda scares me beacuse i was so sure arizona is where i wanted to be my whole life and now everything is changing. Fellings are changing, people are changing, and my overall look on life itself is changing. It all just confuses me so much. Maybe i just need to lay in bed and think about it for a while.

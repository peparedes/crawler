"event","Lately things are coming in perspective.  I've learned alot that I have never even considered thinking about.  Everything is peaceful yet corrupted.  I don't know why people have to be so judgemental about everyone else.  I guess human nature tends to be like that.  If not then what's perfect?  I just wish that things would never have to go badly.  But it's like the respiratory system.  Positive and negative charges.  Up vs down, happy vs sad, better vs worse, live vs die, good vs evil.  Cycles run everything.  There is no straight line that one can follow.  No real path.  There will always be obstacles.  I don't want it but it's there.  I quit crew.  Takes too much of my time.  I need a job.  Money in my life will always run my mother.  I need to help her because she needs me.  I feel bad but it's the cycle.  It will come back to me in some form.  Peace out."

"event","I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles
In our eyes are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned
And I have to speculate that God himself
Did make us into corresponding shapes like
Puzzle pieces from the clay
True, it may seem like a stretch, but
Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled
Head when you're away when I am missing you to death
When you are out there on the road for
Several weeks of shows and when you scan
The radio, I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great
Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away,
'come down now,' but we'll stay...

I tried my best to leave this all on your
Machine but the persistent beat it sounded
Thin upon listening
That frankly will not fly. you will hear
The shrillest highs and lowest lows with
The windows down when this is guiding you home

I am happy to say that I have finished poisonwood bible and that it is the greatest book in the world, well one of them. peace out."

Well first of all one of my sisters, Cassie, she umm went to Las Vegas randomly and she decides to take the only dress that I actually wear and take it with her.. and oh yeah she cuts it all up.. and she has like huge ass boobs so now it will be all stretched out.. damn it.. Next tradegy that happens in my family is my eldest sister, Christina, well she and her fiance(however you spell that stupid word) they split up!! What the fuck.. I don't understand why he would do this to her.. he was all questioning if he should really go through with it.. hes getting cold feet... they were together for 8 years.. thats such a long time and now he wants to take a ""break"" god damn it breaks are pointless... they were planning to get married in December.. she already bought her dress and all her bridesmaid dresses.. which i was going to be one.. and now she is moving all her stuff out of the condo they share and she is moving in with her freind, Jodi.... I mean she said that he never lived on his own they got together right out of high school.. I just don't understand.. This is really affecting all of us because I have only known Mike and no other guy... 8 years thats like half my life and he was always there... it just makes me sad seeing her cry.. she is always strong ... she has been through alot.. She was raped/attacked like about two years ago and then she found out last Christmas that the dad she thought was hers is not.. come to find out she is really full filipino... she is such a good person i dont understand why the fuck all the bad shit happens to her.. if i could just take tha pain away from her i owuld feel so much better.. damn it!!!!!! i hate this.. i guess we just have to wait this out... Pray for us. peace out..."

"event","WOOT! So, things have been a little busy but good. I start working again soon, on the 18th to be exact. Have to go through 3 weeks of training, but I get paid for it so no worries. And this way I have a little more prep time which always helps. I'll be making $11.50 an hour which I think is damned good and gives a lot of extra to start saving for the wedding and a house. So the wedding might actually be on a different date :-). It was so sweet Chris and I are so excited and he wants to marry ASAP!!! So we're thinking maybe new years coming up. A new beginning, a new year, a brand new start as husband and wife. I think it would be so much fun! I just can hardly wait! I found the most beautiful dress *sigh* it's perfect. It looks like a 1920s style (very classy and elegant) with a around the neck halter and v-neck dip so it will look good now that I have a chest. LOL (they've doubled! Go girls go! :-p) Uhm....HAPPY DAYS! Can't wait to get married, everyone knows...that's why I don't really update much anymore, I talk to everyone everyday now. It's really great being on my own, I know it's because I'm here with Chris that it's so much fun. 

  Had a FABULOUS 4th and anniversary. First time Chris and I ever met. We went out to dinner and then sat in the wrangler together and watched the fireworks. It was really sweet :-). Just being close and spending time together like that was GREAT! Couldn't have wished for a better anniversary!!! Got my new ring back from the jewlers, it's STUNNING! Everyone loves it and Chris's mom is even jealous. LOL And luckily this one I'm NOT allergic to! (I had a yellow gold ring with a emerald in the middle and a diamond on each side but I started breaking out in hives around my fingers and it really hurt, my dad is allergic to gold- apparently so am I!) It's so beautiful! It's a upside down triangle shaped blue sapphire (about a carat-it's HUGE!) set in white gold with 3 little diamonds next to it on each side and scrolling down the band. It's so unique looking! And very very classy, like something out of the 20s. I can't wait to start planning the wedding! We've already talked about a few things and I know it's going to be just amazing :-) White chocolate cake with raspberry filling!!! LOL (for that he gets a jeep shaped grooms cake LOL it's so us it's great) Uhm...back to the grocery list I guess, not much else to tell. Just happy and in love and getting married! YAY!"

"event","SO! I don't really like to update on this thing since I talk to everyone now via cell phone, BUT I just couldn't keep this glorious news to myself! As of friday June 4th (ironically exactly one month away from our anniversary) Chris and I officially got engaged! It was so sweet, there were candles all lit up around the apartment and we were laying in a blanket together on the floor in the living room and he just looked at me and took the ring and put it on my finger and asked me!(BTW, the ring is very very pretty!) How exciting! So we've decided to get married on February 14th, 2006. It's a tuesday which might cause some issues, but tuesday works perfect for us because it has been a running joke that we always do nutty things on tuesdays. Hehehe, as long as I've known him it's always been ""only on tuesday"" LOL. So why the hell not! I've already been looking at stuff a bit, I've figured out how I want the cake to look (ivory with red and maybe some white roses all around it and then candles in little glass holders on the layers-I saw something similar and it was STUNNING!) and have some good ideas for the reception but I still have no idea for the rest! I really want the ceremony to be either all red roses or red and white. His family loves me, I just met his grandpa who lives in prescott this weekend. Darling of a man, he's very sweet. His mom and I get along very well, she's basically already adopted me as daughter in law and that was even before she knew we were engaged! When we told her she was so happy she almost started crying. It was kind of sweet really. His dad is funny, he reminds me a lot of my father. Almost identical. IT's like having a home away from home, I like it.  But yes, I'm getting married! WOOT WOOT! I just can't help but gush! Well back to looking on the net at wedding goodies!"

"event","So things have been VERY busy! But I'm doing good actually. Got all my packing done, finishing up my schook project tonight, and got all my shopping done. My folks have been real cool and have been helping me out a lot. They weren't thrilled to begin with when I said I was doing this, but they've come to accept it and are now being very supportive. They're even excited about meeting Chris! :-) My mom bought me a lot of clothes to help keep my costs down, and they're giving us some things from the house that we need. Also my dad decided to give Chris and I some money to tour Vegas on! WEEEEEEEEE!!! And he also told me that they're getting us a few things for the apartment that I couldn't spend money on just yet (soup bowls, oven mitts, iron, can opener, etc) so that's real cool of them. It helps a TON! Plus they're trying to show that they support me and understand that this makes me happy and so they're happy too. 

  Chris will be here in 4 days!!!! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so thrilled!!! OMG!!! So we get to do TONS of fun stuff together! Kind of like a little mini vacation. I was thinkin we could go to the Venetian for a gondola ride (very romantic :-)) then go to the Imperial Palace for the car exhibit cause he loves that stuff and so do I! From there I thought we could go to the Luxor for the 3D dealie thingie they've got, and then to the Bellagio gardens, and then the Excalibur. So much! So fun! From there we go get out pictures taken, and home to a nice steak dinner with my family. I'm really excited :-) I know this is a great thing for me, for us, and that it's going to work out so well. Plus, we're going to see his Grandpa on Sunday on the way home (*sigh* HOME! And it's with my darling!!!) so I'm really excited about that. Chris's grandpa is so important to him and he sounds like a really sweet man so I can't wait to meet him. Anyone who is important to my angel is very important to me! 

  I got my hair done, looks SUPER cute! Was a little more pricey then I had wanted but I'm worth it. LOL Plus I budgeted pretty good so it's ok. I finally got the money from Dani for the Boston trip. Had to go to her folks about it which kind of sucked. I don't like ratting, but it's a $1000 and I hadn't seen a dime in 6 months and I'm leaving in 4 days! Plus I'll be buying a car to get around in once I get my license so it was important that I got it. I'm like totally at ease now that it's settled. That was the last thing I had to worry about and boy was it a WHOPPER!!! But it's done, I got the $$$ and I can now do what I need to do! Rented the uhaul trailer, it's a 5' by 8'. Good size so we should have plenty of room left over. Hehehe, can we say blankets in the back?! ;-)

  I got an A on my paper which was good. Our prof also helped prep us for the exam so exams are actually lookin real easy. Thrusday's exam is just a repeat so I'll get a perfect score there, Wednesday's exam will be a little tricky but he gave us a heads up so it shouldn't be too bad. Friday's exam will be the only one I really have to study for but it's all good. I can do it! So I just have to finish up my poster for sexuality tonight then a paper (SO easy!) and I'm golden. I get my nails and toes done Friday after groceries and then I'm set to go!!

  I'm so so excited! This is the best thing I've ever decided to do. And I figured out I can still get my degree in 3 years! YAY!!! I just have to work a little harder which is cool with me. I've got my husband by my side so I know I can do it. Plus I talked to m old boss Carla today. God I miss her! She's so rad. We're going to keep in touch and when Chris and I come down to visit we can go see her so that'll be fun fun fun! Plus I know we can get the hook up for some tickets. LOL All in all life is feelin pretty darn good right now. It's been rough but everything is coming together and I'm totally peached :-D I just couldn't be happier! :-)"

"event","So it's been a very trying week for me. I've had papers due almost everyday this week. I don't think I really like that. LOLI told my professor that he should have to write the papers as well. He said I should have to grade papers. LOL I said I'd love to! Then I could give myself an A+ and we wouldn't be having this problem! hahaha Yea...he laughed and then started lecture. LOL Guess I didn't get very far with that. hehehe

 So...little more in the news. My loans won't go through as we had expected. I can't get enough money to live on. But it's ok! I think figured it out :-D Chris called me his smart girl :-) I love that tee hee
Ok so, I can't go to school full time. I can't work full time and take full time honors courses and still be able to spend time together with Chris like we want to. SO, my only other option was to drop out for a year because that's how long it will take to establish residency and be able to attend ASU like I want. Well that wasn't going to work because I would have to start paying my loans back and I'd be without medical coverage. But wait! I had a stroke of brilliance!!! I'm going to work full time yes, (I have bills to pay and want some extra money to spoil my hunny bunny with :-) and myself too of course, do the hair, nails and keep pretty)BUT I will be going to school part time. Just a couple classes each semester. That way I don't have to start paying my loans back, I can keep working on my education and my degree, and I can get medical insurance without burning myself out! YAY!! Cool huh? I don't know if I'll be able to get my degree in 3 years like I had planned but that's ok. Being happy and spending time living with my Christopher is totally worth more then all of that! So I freaked out this afternoon but I think everything will be ok. Life doesn't always turn out the way you plan, but change isn't always a bad thing. I think this is going to be so so so good for us. I want to move in with him more then anything in the world and sharing ina life we're making together is like being invited in the gates of heaven :-)

  Things are going great between Chris and I :-). 14 days!!! 14 days till I move in with my love! Oh I can hardly wait! I really need to figure out a vehicle now though. I don't know what I'm going to do about that yet. My dad said he can kick in $1000 towards a car, but I HATE the fact that I'll prolly have to do that. He's starting his masters degree, they're refinancing the house, and they got rid of all their credit cards. Most vehicles in any condition are about $2000 and if I can get the $1000 back from Dani I'm still gonna be short. And I'm on a time CRUNCH. But I'm sure things will work out. I hope, I hope, I hope!

  I got a new bikini :-D. It's cute! $10!! Awesome huh? Gotta love Target! Uhmmm...got a box coming in from Old Navy and got my flip flops and pink pants! Just need a pleated skirt, pinks flip flops,and denim capris and I'm good. Also need some soup bowls, pillows, sheets, and maybe some silverwear but no worries that will come. I found the most BEAUTIFUL claddagh ring on ebay for $50, but I must exert self control cause I still have to get my hair done and my nails done so I look nice. Plus I'm putting a lot towards Chris's b-day :-) I have the best presents lined up! And a special surprise hee hee. Oh but the ring...WOW!!! It was all 24kt white gold, it was a nice slim band with an intricate crown and there was 24kt yellow gold around the wrists and it had a GINORMOUS emerald in the middle. *sigh* le shiny...but anyways don't need to be wasting my money on friviolities for myself.

  So honeybunches might have found me a job already. The job that he had been waiting for is now opening up and he wants to put me in for it. I don't think I'm qualified but he thinks I can do it :-). Gods I love that man! He makes me feel wonderful :-) And so very very intelligent, like I can do anything in the world I set my mind to. He's GREAT!!! I can't wait to move in with him, it's going to be so so SO much fun! WEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!

 Ok so, despite stress and set backs, take that fate! HAH! Chris and I are moving in together and we're going to be happy :-) I Love Christopher Carl Serr!!!"

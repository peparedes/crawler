"event","<p>I miss my mom. She is still alive and we have seen her every month in the last year, we talk and FaceTime often. But of course she isn't the same. She is physically doing okay (although she struggled daily with awful nausea and cannot eat, which isn't really 'okay'), we will know more when she returns to Oregon in June if she will begin chemo again. But her spirit is clouded by the depression that has creeped in post surgery. She has lost her joy, her sense of humor, her curiosity. It's hard, I'm sure it feels like the weight of a million bricks on her soul. But for me, it feels as though I'm losing her. I wonder if she will ever return to Seattle and have fun with us. I wonder what Hazel will remember of her gramma. We had many plans to continue traveling and I had so many hopes and wishes for my daughter to know her gramma like I knew mine. <br>I'm not saying these things aren't going to change and that my mom is on the terminally ill path, but we are traversing this path and it's difficult to be hopeful and supportive at the same time. This is because my heart is breaking too for a future without my mom. <br>We aren't a family that has been impacted by depression in the past and it has been difficult to grasp the reality of cancer and depression at the same time. I do wish I lived near my mom now as we could all try and support her on a daily basis. I see her growing ever more fearful and distant from everything. <br>I called my brother today and requested that he look into support groups for my mom as I think maybe if she knew she wasn't completely alone in her illness, it might help? I just don't know anymore. I am so sad to face this again. <br></p>"

"event","<p>I am feeling that motherhood is very lonely and isolating at times. Before having a child, other childless friends and I would get together with great ease and enjoy each other's company. That doesn't happen as much or really at all anymore. It takes great effort on my part to arrange schedules to either appear without child or to involve said child.  Honestly at the end of the day I'd rather not deal with it. <br>It's not as though I have a lot of time or any time to join in activities with other moms as I work 40 plus hours a week outside of the home. There is no place for moms like me. I know we are out there but we are all so busy and tired to get together. <br>And hanging out with some of my childless friends (none here) can be a drag. My friend actually said to the other that she would love to hang out with the other after our dinner on Saturday, that she really needed to hang out with other adults. I know she didn't mean it to be an insult to me and my child sitting across from her but you know it still hurt. And then they go off and have a great time and I go home with my lovely sweet child. It was early, I was hoping we could go get coffee or something, I even asked the question, so what are your plans afterward? One friend turns to the other and they make plans, while I pay the bill. <br>This is our life and this is motherhood. I guess I just wish it didn't feel so isolating sometimes. Maybe it's because of everything else going on as well. It's almost spring and there will be lots of new fun things to do with Hazel and Tom and I'm looking forward to those times.</p>"

"event","So many things have been racing around in my head really since I returned to the states, now 6 weeks ago. I feel as though I have had no time to breathe and no time to adjust to this life. It is weird to think that being in Kenya could change me so quickly, but that is the truth about it all. More than any of my other travels outside of the country, being in Kenya, meeting and living among people whose lives are all about pure survival had a profound effect on my psyche. I returned a mish-mash of emotions, while all the time attempting to comfort my fiance in his time of grief and pushing back my own sadness about my changed plans. 

We moved forward in stride and more good things occurred: the house, a new job for me, a new job for Tom, new furniture and a new life for us. but I'm still in Kenya in my mind. I wake up every morning and struggle with the fact that I have three bathrooms with running water. I can wash my clothes in a fancy washing machine, I can take an amazingly hot shower, I can walk around without fear of running into dying cockroaches. I have access to water, I live in a country where most people have access to running, clean water. 

In Kenya there is a huge drought. I was afforded 3 liters of drinkable water every day. That water could be used to drink, brush my teeth or wash my hands clean so that I could take my contacts out. We were able to use non-filtered water from Lake Victoria for household things like washing dishes, washing clothes and dumping into our toilet (as the running water was not working, we were lucky to actually have toilets though. Everyone else uses latrines. 

I realized that water is everything, I mean survival. It grows food, it cooks food, it helps animals grow, it helps heal people and it is life. So that has been at the core of my struggle. I don't feel that i can really enjoy the life I have been afforded, when so many (whole countries of people) have none. In an effort to quell the guilt I have, we fulfilled my end of the promise to purchase a water tank (500L) for the orphan daycare at Mama Na Dada. They used to have a smaller tank (250L) but something happened to it, so instead the organization has to pay high rates to have smaller amounts of water delivered when it is much cheaper to have a large amount delivered less often. Then the money that is saved can go into providing food for the orphans. The tank was about $670 and the other volunteer at Mama Na Dada raised half and I was going to raise half but time got away from me and we just decided to make that our holiday donation. 

There is so much more I wanted to do while I was there and upon my return. I do hope that I am able to fulfill some of the other goals I made while I was there."

"event","So since last Friday, I have done the following:

1. cut my finger so deep while cooking dinner that I needed to go to urgent care.

2. burned my arm putting pizza in the fridge

3. spilled coffee on myself twice

4. dumped a 32-oz bottle of water in my gym bag, leaving my phone dead forever.

5. spilled miso on my sweater

6. poured coffee on my desk calendar

7. spilled coffee on the same case file twice (after having taken it out and placed it in a new folder).

The biggest culprit appears to be coffee so I need to find a way to transport it better. I also need to learn how to tighten lids. But the biggest thing, outside of wearing a bib would be that I need to slow down. I blame it on my dual ear infections plus sinus infection-leading to instability. 

Everything else is good. I went to kickboxing, bought our turkey for Thanksgiving and our new dining room table was delivered! This life even though a bit clumsy is quite great."

So now after a couple of weeks of just feeling as though I'm banging my head against the wall and hanging on for dear life...instead I am going to grit my teeth and make every minute count. It will be difficult as I have just about every second of my life planned out until I leave for Kenya, but I'm goin to do better. 

I have a couple well, more than a couple try about 15 very hard cases right now. Instead of being afraid of how to move forward, I'm just going to bust on through. Yeah! Technically I only have four more weeks of receiving open referrals, but I have 10 cases ready to close and 20 cases that need more work.  But it can happen. The earth never gives you more than you can handle. So, that is my peace. 

In other news, I ecstatically received my Kenyan visa today! So it is soo real, so awesomely real that I am going to be on a plane to Kenya in 6 weeks. I cannot believe it. Crazy. I'm so excited. so excited. I know that the break is going to be so good for me. Living off the grid for a while, although I will do updates as I am able. 

Not much else, or too much else. Lots of girl time this week which is great: had dinner with my three UPS roommates tonight, tomorrow is dinner with my friend Mar, and Wednesday its dinner with my friend Jacqui. Thursday my mother comes into town and we have dress trying on in the morning (Friday) and a bridal shower for my dear friend Lisa in the evening. Saturday is the VILLAGE party and then Sunday hopefully there will be some relaxing. Then it starts again...breathe."

So far this week, we received bad news about Tom's dad, we've looked at houses, we've met with a lender and we've considered our entire future within three days. Faced with all these possibilities I have lost all ability to make any decisions. I spent 30 minutes in the grocery store after kickboxing class just trying to decide what to eat for dinner. 

The other weird news of the day: one of the tenants in my building was the victim of a burglary. Isn't that weird? I can't even imagine, but I guess it's a sign that I'm ready to move on to our own place right? At first I was scared about moving in with a boy, sharing space and chores and stuff. But now I'm getting excited. I don't really like living alone for one and only really want to share my space with Tom. I never thought I'd want to be with someone as much as I want to be with him. It's so great. Actual real love is pretty amazing. Trust me and you will know when it happens b/c it will knock you over and then pick you up and fly you over a beautiful meadow of flowers and up towards the sunshine. (hahaha, sorry I got a little ridiculously poetic there for a minute).

Hey, if you are voting in Seattle you should head over to channel 22 and watch the video voters guide. It is very informative. Just watching people talk for themselves is very telling. Some people use cards, some people have their speeches memorized while others really aren't good public speakers. 

What else? Oh I'm throwing myself back 16 years and heading to Umatilla this weekend with Tom. It'll be the first time I've been back since 2003 and I imagine it will be my last. So let's live it up Umatilla. =)"

It's so wonderful b/c outside my window right now, the Wallingford kiddie parade groups are staging. So there is lots of chatter, drumming, trumpeting and merriment. I love it! I might head down there shortly, but I am trying hard to not move so fast on this day when I have a lot to accomplish. The wonderful thing is that I have the day to myself, for the first time in a long time. Hiking is out b/c Melissa injured herself =(, but the break is good. I need a day, especially after the craziness of the last two weeks. 

Work remains to be hectic, but I do feel the slower undercurrent allowing breathing time. It's nice, but we are still under a lot of pressure to get cases closed, get them closed right, (of course) and to just keep moving even though everything is so tight (placements, services, interventions)-I feel as though my job is to lead families to a river that is dried up and then tell them to float down it. I mean, it feels not hopeless, but pretty close. I just can do what I can do and that is it. I still remain committed, yet I know that I need a break-about 2.5 more months until I leave for Kenya. 

I did have my director meeting this week and we discussed the actual plan-which is soo exciting. I am going to be spending 5 weeks at Mama Na Dada village (www.villagevolunteers.org) and I will be providing counseling and small group facilitation with mothers/women/children who are impacted by grief, loss and illness. I cannot tell you HOW excited I am about this. It's totally up my alley and I am just so ready. Tom will meet me in Namunyak, where we will volunteer a few days at the local Wings of Hope school before setting off on safari. We will then spend our last two days in Nairobi. 

And now of course, we are also officially engaged! It is so crazy wearing this beautiful ring on my finger, which according to my mother signals to the rest of the world that I am TAKEN. (sometimes my mother is so old school, but I love her) It's true world, I am a taken woman so don't get any crazy ideas. I am so ridiculously happy (yet calm and relaxed). I think I spend most of my time (thankfully) just savoring the moment b/c I don't know what the next holds. It's a wonderful way to live life really, just being in the moment. 

I know I/we have a lot of work ahead as far as the wedding, but we are also going to enjoy this part too. I am now looking for an officiant, non-cheesy wedding websites (for us) and invitations. Any tips?"

"event","I'm in Ohio right now, why? Because a relative caregiver is giving up on the child that she agreed to care for 11 years ago. So, tomorrow I pick her up and fly her back to Seattle with me. In the meantime I am sitting in the hotel, contemplating dinner and then a workout. And enjoying cable tv. Guess what is on? Whose wedding is it anyway? today on the plane guess what movie was playing? Bride Wars. And guess who discussed wedding dates and sites this weekend? We did! Holy cow! 

So, Tom wants to wait to set a date until he gets the ring but also understands that maybe we need to set the date to secure the site before the ring comes. He has the perfect date set aside and blah blah blah, sure that is great. but we have been planning on getting married since Christmas. I bought my first wedding magazine today and the woman who sold it to me is also getting married next year and she doesn't have a ring. It is apparently not so uncommon. Really the only thing that needs to be established is the location and date. then we can move on to focus on Kenya and the home buying (which will be happening close to when we return from Kenya). 

The greatest relief right now is that we aren't focused on the crash anymore. It seems so far away, which is great. We are still doing physical therapy but now it's just twice a week and other than odd nagging pain I'm feeling pretty good. Hiking and kickboxing are going well, so much that I made it to the next level in kickboxing-the red glove club. 

Life in general is pretty great. Work is draining and overwhelming but I let it go the second I leave the office. I just really can't wait to spend the rest of my life with that man, I am so lucky."

"event","OMG, I had no idea how awesome hothouse spa was! Why have I not discovered this heaven before? I feel so much better (well, a lot better minus the slight dehydration I am experiencing from all the sauna and steaming).  Since we've been getting a lot of massages recently for therapeutic reasons, they have been less relaxing and more about relieving pain. So b/c sitting in a sauna and steam room are all about relaxing-that is totally what I felt. The hot tub wasn't as exciting for me, but I'm not a huge hot tub fan. It's really all about the steam and the sauna. There was a woman who had been there a really long time, I was getting worried for her. I feel like 45 minutes is about my max. But geez, you can pay your $12 and stay forever (or at least until midnight). 

I'm happy for the weekend and trying so hard not to think about Monday."

1. how to get the gasoline smell out of my clothes and then out of the washing machine.
2. how to get rid of the pounding in my head caused by the concussion received in car collision 
3. how to pull my life a little together so when Tom returns home tomorrow, I can focus on him

So we were in a car collision, a pretty major one complete with criminal investigation, loss of consciousness and lots of pain. It was the single scariest moment of my life, sitting next to the love of my life and seeing that he was unconscious. i never realized how painful it feels in an instant to imagine that you are losing the one you love, the one chosen as a partner, not a parent, grandparent, brother, sister or friend. Those are also incredibly powerful losses, but it is definitely different when it is your partner. 

Thankfully Tom will be okay, we are both so lucky and I'm so thankful that we both have wonderful family and friends who have pulled together in just 24 hours to provide support to both of us. I am truly a very lucky girl. I know this."

I should be volunteering today, but my low energy, low-level cold and desire to re-charge have me back at home after an early brunch with girlfriends. 

Yesterday i woke up at 8, went to kickboxing, then took bitsy to the vet, went to a massage and then spent four hours playing Wii and hanging out with one of my best girlfriends. Every day since I can remember, I've had appointments, commitments and things to accomplish. I marvel at the fact that I am just one person and have a to-do list that is neverending. How will I ever have a family without going crazy? 

I know the answer, other things become a priority. So, why can't I have more free time now as a single person? Living in the city definitely influences my inability to slow down. So this afternoon, in the five hours I have to myself before Sunday dinner-I'm going to nap, clean my bathroom, pay bills, take a walk and watch a movie. See even my re-charge time has a list. Let's start with the much needed nap."

"event","Barely awake, I climbed into a friend of my friend's car at 1:30am. I dozed off a couple of times during our ride downtown and I dazely got out of the car once at the Compass Center. Immediately I was engulfed with excitement and I was no longer sleepy. There were people everywhere, the kind of crowd you might see at a football game, everyone was awake, talkative, smiling and there to do the same thing: participate in the One Night Count-doing a moment-in-time count of the homeless population in King county. 

I saw friends from my past and met with people and really just became inspired (or re-inspired) that so many people (maybe about 300) came out in the middle of the deep night to count people who are never counted among those who matter. I think that is one of the biggest reasons i continue to volunteer-to be part of an amazingly motivated and inspirational group of fellow volunteers taking time to be part of what matters.

The count went well and was incredibly organized (if in fact you are interested in doing it for next year, as I know I will). We returned back at the Compass Center at 415 and had a delicious breakfast prepared by St. Cloud restaurant and served by a swarm of amazing volunteers. 

*Oh ps. next time you see me, remind me to tell you how i made a complete idiot of myself at the count. It's funny and I still feel kind of ridiculously stupid. But alas, that is also part of life."

I am fulfilling the first in a year of volunteer goals: the One Night Count for King County. I thought I would do this and then I thought I would not b/c you know it's so late and all. But then I decided since I entered it in my 43things list and I told someone I would do it, that I should just do it. So now I have a lovely 2 hours to kill before I get picked up and we head downtown to count sleeping Homeless people. 

In a way it's something that I can do, I can't give money right now b/c I am giving all of my money to this volunteer trip to Kenya. So I will be volunteering with a different cause each month until I leave (this is outside of my regular volunteer gig at Bailey Boushay). I think 2009 is definitely becoming the year of pushing myself further. 

Tonight's gig is also first of many things I will be doing to kick myself in the shins so to say. I'm not feeling ambivalence or lethargy, but I am feeling discouraged in a way in thinking about the coming year and all of the things that seem to be going on. I am hopeful, that is how I get through each day of doing the work I do; but it looks scary. I need to keep moving, keep challenging myself and keep my eye on what is important. 

Going to Kenya, even for a short period of time, may or may not provide me with an opportunity to see the world differently for a bit. Maybe I will see humanity in a different light, I will reconnect with hope, reconnect with why i do what I do. That is my real hope for this coming year. June will mark 3 years as a CPS social worker and I still love it. The responsibility is quite overwhelming at times (and as the forecast states-it is about to get real heavy), but I see it as a challenge. I'm crossing my fingers that I can make the right decisions about my career and determine if I want to do administrative work or continue with direct practice. I think I still have a year or so to decide and well, by that time things could/will look a bit different for me personally. 

2008 I accomplished many things big and small and I have to remember that when i start to feel tentative. the only thing ever stopping me from accomplishing any goal is myself. Okay, now for trying to stay awake."

We got a look at it tonight during our Union e-board meeting and normally, I kind of pass by those things that they pass around, but my eyes were glued to the table as I read cut, after cut, after cut. I don't know that I can even do my job (even though I am lucky enough to have one). All the progress we've attempted to make in child welfare alone will be completely undone by these cuts. I know it looks as though CA (childrens administration) is barely touched (as Braam lawsuit mandates a certain number of social workers blah blah blah); but everything we depend upon from crisis foster homes to mental health to health insurance for foster kids are all being demolished. Not to mention what they want to do with GAU.

I make these lists on a regular basis now, mostly when I know that someone is ill or is not doing well. Sometimes I make lists of things that I maybe missing, as what happened recently in my torrent of traveling and the snow and all of the mayhem. I misplaced the following things:

1. one north face glove
2. one grey wool glove
3. one bottle of naturopathic remedy
4. one blackberry phone charger
5. my best friend's pashmina =(
6. one netflix dvd

I made the list on Friday and found all but two of the items (my best friend's pashmina and the grey wool glove) yesterday. So I'm holding out on the pashmina b/c it was expensive and I feel so bad (and I will replace it if not located).

Now on my list of things that will energetically be fixed or reappear are:
1. my camera (please come back to life)
2. that other grey wool glove 
3. a new cell phone (I don't know that I can make it to April with my semi-working phone)

Plus I am super caught up on all of my work (I mean, as far as low caseload goes) so I don't feel so guilty. 

So projects that I need to complete today:
1. repair window covering so that it is operating at 100% of it's potential to keep Bitsy and I warm.
2. Holiday cards. I went back and forth about this one, I am definitely not sending out as many cards as years past. But I do have some supplies to make new cards and sharing the holiday spirit is a nice thing to do.
3. Bake cookies. I am baking cookies for Tom's family, my friend BK, my office (if I make it in tomorrow) and my family (if there are any left).  I just bought a fantastic new cookie sheet from Crate and Barrel last night, I can't wait to try it out. 
4. Clean clean clean. I am leaving for 10 days over the holiday and I love to have my apartment clean and organized so in the case of my death, people will be able to locate things. It's kind of morbid, but also very motivating. I don't want people to think I was a slob. 

That should keep my busy for the day. Tonight I have kickboxing. Hopefully I will be able to make it out to Prancer and dancer tonight.

http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/06/muslim_cowboy/

The dream I had when I was in high school to become a country singer. Although i didn't do much to actually pursue my dream minus singing at the top of my lungs to the latest country music. It seemed like an impossible novel dream. I don't know if we actually ever discussed it, but I always thought that Richard and I would make an interesting country duo. Although one of us would have to learn how to play the guitar as I only knew how to play the sax and Richard only played the trumpet. 

I dated boys who wore wranglers and chewed tobacco, although I never put on a pair of wranglers myself. I just couldn't, the only Asians I knew were Connie Chung and the boy who worked at the movie theatre with me. Neither of them dressed up as cowboys. The cowboy look was only good for boys and girls who were in the rodeo and 4-H. I think it's funny now that I am dating a boy from the Midwest, basically a carbon copy of the boys I grew up with although he has brains and a good job oh and no criminal record."

I haven't had any sugar minus that piece of ginger chew (forgot they had sugar-duh) and am doing pretty good. 

I made turkey noodle soup last night/this morning. The broth sat simmering in my crock pot over night and I chopped up all the turkey meat, vegetables and noodles this morning. It's quite tasty, not as turkey-ey as I would like, but not bad for my first try. 

I am looking at another day in court this week (even though I was just in court last week!). Apparently, it appears that our filing rates will go up which means a lot of work. Plus the cases are just very complicated, i guess it doesn't get easier right? 

Thankfully, I had an amazing weekend of mom, boyfriend and friends to hold me over to this weekend. The Nutcracker was fun and magical with my mother, Tom and I saw Quantum of Solace (which my mother responded, 'man you must really love him') yeah not really my type of movie, but it was very good.

I just sent out five emails pertaining to events that need to occur in the next 3 weeks. All of them are voluntary events: movie/dinner night, Happy Hour with girlfriends, catch up dinner with another friend....ect. I had put off sending these emails b/c of sheer avoidance of the matters at hand. And these are all things that I want to do of course, spending time with my friends is so important and fills my ever draining cup of energy. 

I have spent a lot of time ruminating about my work to do list, even though there is little for me to do about it on the weekend. I am about half way there and feeling a bit better, but there is always that chance that I will get a case this week that will explode and everything else will have to be put on the backburner. Let's cross out fingers for another calm week. 

In very exciting news, I had a friend with my friend/Ex-director of Village Volunteers yesterday. My plans for going to Ghana have now been changed to Kenya and actually presenting portions of the Shanti model to existing support groups and women's groups. I am going to working with PLWA (people living with AIDS) in three different villages in Kenya. This is actually what I was planning on doing on my second go-around (I had initially planned two trips to Africa, one in 2009 and one in 2010), but the ED feels that master plan is do-able in the first go-around b/c of the existing infrastructure. My eyes are so big right now and I'm so excited. I am a little nervous about the financial piece of it as I will be missing 8 weeks of work, still have my place here to pay for and the actual cost of the trip. But whatever, it will all work itself out. It may mean leaving in August or September instead of April. This really, if it happens, is one of my lifelong dreams...so it feels pretty amazing to see that it is actually possible. 

And then we started talking about Vietnam...Village Volunteers in Vietnam-yeah I could be a part of that definitely.

*Halloween with the food chain. Dancing in the corner of the Juju with a giraffe and a shark made me so happy. Being crowded in McLeod with so many friends was also magical and frenetic. 
*Brunch with my boy this morning after a very long day of cleaning, packing, and moving him to his new digs in Ballard. We had this amazing lovely conversation about all things. I feel incredibly lucky to have him in my life right now.
*the very kind compliments I received over the week from a foster parent regarding the work I'm doing. I feel so blessed. 

I still love my job but i feel that my cases have gotten increasingly more difficult and that I'm wanting to really dive down deeper to be a better social worker. It's harder in these times though b/c there are less resources available, less safety nets and few options. And for me, someone who tends to depend upon providing real options or real items to those who need assistance, I am having to fine tune the work I do. Not that I have relied entirely upon provided real resources in the past, but it can assist in building a relationship with families if one is able to provide something tangible in tandem with providing real support. 

I don't believe that this current economic situation is increasing the number of children in care (that may happen later), but I believe that it is putting more children at risk. Formally tenuous situations are worse and the risk factors have increased, which means more investigations/more CPS involvement. The population I work with (Des Moines, Burien, White Center etc.) is feeling even more desperate than before and that intensifies stress which makes it harder to engage folks."

Melissa and i were looking for something that was about 4,500 feet elevation gain yet not 14 miles long. Thunder Mountain here we come! It was gorgeous as you all know. The first 1 1/2 miles was quite steep, climbing about 1,100 ft in the first mile. I had shin splints like no one's business possibly due to dehydration, but I am a trooper. We made it to this lake: 
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nishushan/pic/00023ed8/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/nishushan/pic/00023ed8/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
Then we hiked about another 1 1/2 miles to a small clearing at the bottom of a mountain. Melissa had been going on about the possibility of bears and I kept trying to persuade her that there is no way we are going to run into bears. Not that I have magical knowledge of such things, but I couldn't imagine that we would be the victim of a bear attack, I know that much. Just as i started to tell her that there is no way bears are hanging out in this particular area, I spotted ONE! At first I wasn't sure, however in hindsight a human wearing all brown and no backpack climbing up rocks on all fours is kind of improbable. He was super cute bounding away from us. 

The unfortunate thing is that while he was bounding away from us, he was bounding towards our future path. So, we decided to turn around as to not risk being attacked by a bear. Here is another, unfortunately I didn't get any of the bear. So hiking season ends with adventure.

"event","The end of summer is really here, or I mean has already passed? Should have informed me on Friday evening while I packed for the ill-fated overnight backpacking adventure Melissa and I had planned. What I can say is that we survived and that I love my backpacking buddy (even if the bf is in line to take her place. I threatened as a child would, that if he wants me he also has to take Melissa and her boyfriend too! I am having some serious separation anxiety. You know that moment when you realize that the boy you are with is quite serious and wants to be your #1? Yeah, well that is definitely happening and my threats of getting not just a girlfriend but her best friend and her unwilling boyfriend are not stopping him.)

Hindsight is always 20/20 right? Even though Melissa and I have accomplished great feats over the summer with our 12 hikes covering over 20,000 miles in elevation gain, taking on a 4,500 foot elevation gain hike (the most we would have covered this season) with 50 lb. packs on our backs was not the most sound goal we've had. We started on the trail around 4:00pm (quite late unless of course we were hiking at the height of the summer time) and it was POURING, I mean POURING. Every inch of clothing I had on my body was soaked within the first mile. I pulled out the book and realized that there was a campground 1.5 miles in and we decided that it was getting quite dark and that stopping here for the night would be best, we could then finish the hike in the morning sans the 50 pound pack. Because seriously, we had not done any hiking up hills with 50 pounds this season. so really attempting your highest elevation gain, longest mileage with lots of weight is NOT smart. That was lesson #1. 

It continued to pour and pour all night. Even when threatened with a mini-forest fire when the stove caught on fire. Thankfully it was raining so much that it didn't catch anything else on fire. It took nerves of steel to reach under the flame and turn off the stove. We actually did have a decent meal of grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes courtesy of the freeze dried food industry. 

We woke up this morning and both decided that we didn't want to continue to hike the 5.3 miles up and 6.8 miles back b/c we were both soaking wet with no end in sight rainwise. We packed up our very wet gear and had a mediocre breakfast in Monroe. 

We do have one more hike planned for next week where we will actually achieve our goal of 4,500 ft. for the season, but we will not be attempting to backpack it. that was just silly at least for right now.

"event","Yesterday my phone died. Well, it died after being drowned by Kombucha in my grocery bag. I'm sad and torn b/c I don't want to shell out money for a new but I don't want to downgrade to my old old phone (which I still have). That and the fact that I don't have vacuum bags for my vacuum cleaner, are among the most traumatic stressful things in my life right now. Well, work is stressful but that is a give in. 

Right now I am quite happy and life is quite good. I had wondered for a long time when or if I would be in a relationship that was as equally satisfying as the rest of my life has been this last year. And I hate to sound ridiculous, but I think that I have quite possibly found it. He doesn't cause me any sort of anxiety, we have a lot in common, we have a very similar family backgrounds and well he is just really adorable. So, life is super great right now.

Today's hike, #13 of the season was tough-Granite Mountain. 8.6 miles and 4,000 elevation gain. That is most I've done since I did Yosemite Falls last year. It was mostly tough b/c I was sick last night (after not getting any sleep Friday and being very dehydrated) and the fact that is a strenuous hike. We got to the top of the Mountain but then had to hike further to the Fire Lookout. I didn't want to do it and tried to get out of it. Then I had a ""oh crap"" moment when I stepped on a loose rock, fell back and the large loose rock followed on top of me. I was fine, but I thought maybe at that moment I had gotten out of climbing to the fire tower. No go, I was fine and we hustled up the 'it looks worse than it is' climb. The views are amazing up there!

so yeah, life is good and now I'm going to head home to my internet-less, cell phone-less life!"

"event","I actually don't miss the internet that much, but I do feel as though I have become very disconnected to the rest of the world. I haven't seen some of you in a really long time and NO it's not because I am now dating someone. (even though I have seen a great deal of him recently, but hey who else is going to pick me up from White Center at 10:30pm?) I think August kind of swallowed me whole and September is really just the month where I don't really exist to anyone but my job (if this year is anything like the last two years). 

I spent this last weekend in Portland with my family to see the blessing of my third nephew. It was relaxing and just what I needed after working two 14 hour days in a row. I slept, played with my nephews and niece, played cards and just relaxed. I think it has helped b/c in the 5 hours I worked this morning I was very calm even though it was quite chaotic. The last part of the day was spent in a very long meeting between Union and management. I am nervous because I spoke out against my supervisors (not purposely) but in informing the management that we are getting incorrect information. Now I fear that I might become one of those targeted ""trouble"" workers and they will try and boot me out. I know it's kind of a fear based in ridiculousness b/c I am a good worker, but I could see that my AA (my supervisor's boss) was giving me looks during the rest of the meeting. 

But fears aside I am really glad that the hiking and the relaxing is helping me keep my cool at work. I am going to try and meditate 20 minutes 3 times this week and see if that also helps. I read that tip in the mystery Prevention subscription that arrived in my mailbox recently. it's kind of the reader's digest version of health-related information and I want to know why I keep getting it. I pawned them off on my mother in exchange for some laundry. 

I continue to realize how lucky I am every day that I get to do what I love and be surrounded by the people I love. So now I am going to work hard to get those not-seen-so-recently people seen. i miss you."

"event","On one hand I really love not having the internet, but it does mean that I am very behind on what is happening with my dear friends when I don't get to see them as much. I didn't anticipate this week being as busy as it turned out. I had a great acupuncture appointment on Tuesday (all of my soreness magically gone!), then Wednesday and Thursday were taken up by Union activities (with a brief spot at McLeod for Badmovieart night). Thursday was fun, we phone banked Thurston county Union members to remind them to vote in the AUGUST 19TH STATE PRIMARY (remember!) and to politely remind them that they should vote for Christine Gregoire. Then we went out for drinks where we continued to plot for world domination (union style). 

I was volunteered to sit on the Union Management Communications Committee Meeting for Children's Administration (the organization I work for under DSHS) and I'm running for the executive board of our Local 843 in October. If you are part of Local 843 (which means I would most likely know that you were), then you need to come out on October 8th. Although that is very far away from today. That will be the end of my commitments to the Union (i promise). I am really enjoying it though, it really interesting and exciting to be part of a movement that aligns well with my own values. (obviously, i guess this is why people join movements)

Last night rickaroo and I went to this lovely wedding of my dear friend at the Edgewater Hotel. She is Korean and he is French and I forgot to warn Rick that the ceremony may be in at least two languages. It was really beautiful, if not funny during certain points in the ceremony. My friend looked beautiful of course and her husband looks like the Little Prince (according to Rick and I agree). The food was amazingly rich and delicious, the cake-very sweet but very unique. (the groom's choice) I love weddings, they are so fun and of course the view was TO DIE FOR. Yeah, I want to have my wedding there. 

This weekend is an off weekend for hiking, which is kind of nice. I'm going to a going away BBQ later this afternoon then to the Drive-in with a new special boy. (aka the reason for this giddy smile on my face) Tomorrow I actually have no plans, maybe brunch?, definitely volunteering and maybe pulling my life together after two weeks of chaos. Because come Monday, it all starts again and work is definitely gearing up to be crazy...."

"event","I have to tell you a little secret- life is super good. 

Saturday I woke up from a crazed stupor and put on softball clothes and headed out to Skyway park for softball tourney. I have to admit, the park is kind of ghetto, I mean it's in Skyway right? It did rain on and off during the day, but we were able to make it to the Championship game (dude, we were undefeated during the season was there doubt?), however after the first half of the first inning, lightening struck and it started pouring insane amounts of water. So much that we ducked for cover and called it for re-match. Softball season lives on...

Saturday night..oh that is the good stuff. I cannot stop smiling when I think about it. But I'm mum here. 

Sunday was Hike #10-Kendall Katwalk (pictures to come, I forgot to upload them). Unfortunately i don't know how to read or stay consistent. As you may have read earlier, Melissa and I were working up to our final hike Big Heart Lake. It is a cumulative elevation gain of 4,500 (1,000 ft. more than our last hike of last season Mt. Si). When I created the schedule Kendall Katwalk wasn't originally part of it. But Maggie convinced me that it was worth putting on the schedule. Well, I must have calculated incorrectly (I took the beginning and the ending elevations and subtracted), I was thinking it was 2,700 elevation gain (which is actually correct). Unfortunately, that is not the cumulative gain-4,200. You can imagine my dismay at re-reading the stats in the book enroute to our destination. I guess at this rate we could do Big Heart Lake next week, but we won't. We still have 5 more weekends of hikes. We are going to actually finish at the end of September instead of October b/c of the scheduling conflicts. So, any brave souls willing to go hiking with me the beginning of October-I will be free. 

The hike was long...11.4 miles. A little too long after a long day of playing softball. But we survived and it was cool. I liked it over Mt. Si and similar hikes b/c it wasn't just switchback after switchback. The terrain varied and we were afforded views of trees, rocky cliffs and the ""Katwalk"". Melissa wasn't as impressed with the actual Katwalk as it was cloudy and difficult to see much. Oh and it was freezing as well. But overall I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars. And today i am incredibly sore..."

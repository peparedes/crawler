"event","So my birthday week has come to an end and it was a pretty great ride :D

Monday - ate out at Taqueria el Amigo with Abe
Tuesday - got birthday wishes from my guild 
Wednesday - snow day!  worked from home and relaxed
Thursday - my actual birthdate - went to Qdoba with Matt (my choice!, lol).  I got one of those happy birthday e-mails in my inbox for a free meal!!  Had to use it!  Granted it gave me a week to cash it in but, hey, why not?!  lol
Friday - Stone's Public House with Matt, Abe and Kate
Saturday - dinner at Neil's house to celebrate our (Olivia, too) birthdays.  She made me homemade chicken parm, garlic bread and pasta.  Then we had a PB ice cream cake and brownies for dessert.  It was delish!
Today - went to MOS and Penang's for dinner with Matt, Sarah Lynn, Carrie, Dani.  We saw the Kinex and Race exhibits that were temporary.   

Anywho.  I haven't updated this for a long time.  Work has been great.  Matt has been greater. Life has been looking up and has been for a while now.  I have a great set of friends who are solid and I'm working towards a closer relationship with all of my family members.  All I need is to get into grad school with a cute single apt and things will be perfect!

Well, that's the short of it.  Update again. . .who knows when."

"event","Me and Matt went to see Sevendust and 10 Years play at the Hard Drive Live Tour last weekend.  We went to that in place of the Pandemonium show because it was cancelled.  I thought it was odd that all the shows were cancelled, especially since this was suppose to be the first time they've gone live.  We couldn't think of anything else we wanted to do so we figured since he wanted to see 10 Years and I wanted to go to a rock show, that it was perfect, lol.  We had a good time :)  I got a pick from the bassist of Since October.

This week in general has been very stressful.  I haven't felt too hot for the last two days and something is seriously wrong with my stomach.  Last night I was in extreme pain on and off.  It wasn't getting any worse, but it hurt like hell!  I felt bad that I kept waking Matt up.  People keep telling me that it's due to stress.  I just hope that it doesn't turn into me having an ulcer or something.

Weight Watchers is definitely more difficult than I expected.  I knew I wouldn't have a problem eating less on a day to day routine. . .but when I get stressed, I binge a lot!  Matt told me that yesteday was the worst day I've had so far.  I got my new Emeril cookware set in the mail today, so hopefully I'll be cooking healthier meals from here on out.  I just need to find some foods that are appealing to me more than all the crap I binge.  That's the hard part.

I switched banks from Sovereign Bank to Citizens Bank.  I've been wanting to switch banks for a while now but nothing <i>really</i> stood out to me, until Citizens.  I haven't heard anything bad about Citizens so hopefully I made the right choice.  A while ago I was going to switch to Metro Credit Union but I decided against it because there aren't locations that are easily accessible wherever I go.  On the other hand, they pay for all other bank's fees. . .I don't know.  I guess it's not too difficult to change banks again, the only thing is waiting for work to switch over my account info for direct deposit.  Maybe I'll stop in on Metro Credit Union and ask them about opening an account.  In any case, I just didn't want to be with Sovereign Bank anymore.

I guess on the upside, I don't have any plans for this weekend.  *thumbs up*  I'm resting, allll weekend."

"event","It's been 1 year that me and Matt made things official.  I completely adore him!  He picked a restaurant in the North End and I picked a night out.  We're going out to dinner tomorrow night and we're going to see Pandemonium towards the end of October.  Everything's a bit scattered because of work and life in general but I'm not planning on going anywhere so it's fine :)  We got each other cards too.  I loved his!  It was really cute.  I'm just lucky to be able to wake up next to him each morning that I do.

Happy 1 Year Anniversary Matthew!  I love you!"

"event","I get home after being at work and the first thing Jill says to me is ""When is your next client?""  Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I'm thinking that she's just asking because she's trying to start conversation. . .nope, wrong!  She's trying to kick me out of the living room because she was going to watch 90210.  Well fuck me!  Who am I to think that I should be able to walk into my own home and think I can sit down on the couch.  I ignored it and turned the tv on anyways, and then the nagging started.  My God!  So I did one quest and got off and said ""here you go"".  No thank you, no nothing.  Don't think it was that easy. . .even after that she continued saying ""I never get to sit on the couch and relax.  It sucks that we both have fridays off"".  No, you dumb broad!  I don't have fridays.  I'm on call.  I've had ENOUGH of her.  Just because you chose to take the overnight shift doesn't mean that you can fucking boss me around and tell me how or not to watch tv, breathe, laugh or eat!  She fucking complains about anything whether or not she's awake!

When I went on vacation and came back, most normal people would ask how my vacation was. . .she comes into my room and talks about how she's drunk and how her life is so busy because she's trying to take care of her work friend who's father died in an electrical accident.  Matt's dad is an electrician and he goes, ""Wow, that could have easily been me!"". . .of course Jill completely disregards his comment.  She's completely self involved.

I want out, NOW!"

"event","Soooo. . .it's been a while, I know.  Virginia Beach was amazing!  We did so much stuff there.  I really miss it.  I could see it getting old though, so in a way I'm glad that I came back.  Hmmm, let's think. . .we went parasailing 1,200 feet in the air, petted sting rays at the aquarium, went to the boardwalk and bought 5 hermit crabs that we named after Monster Hunter monsters, got Old Times photos done, went pirate mini-golfing, shopping, ate at Sonic's and Yama Sushi Bar and of course went to the beach!  We weren't able to go every day as planned because it was stormy but the days we did go were nice.  One night we even made a campfire and made smores.  It was great being able to see all of my cousins and family, not to mention being able to spend time with my boyfriend away from all the stress normal day to day life brings.  

As for lately, I've been pretty busy.  My first week being back, last week, I was on on-call for FamilyWorks. A lot of people think I'm crazy for signing up for the week after my vacation, but I don't mind it because I feel like it forces me to get back in the swing of things.  I didn't get any calls that needed my attention.  I got two, one was for CSA so I redirected it, and the other was for FamilyWorks but I was on a call for MCI so I had it redirected to the back up supervisor.  My caseload has been pretty steady.  An incident happened with one of my client and I ended up completing my day earlier than expected due to stress.  It's been 2 days since that incident and I guess it's ok.  As for the rest, they're all doing well.  Next week my work week is a bit overloaded.

I've been doing more fun things lately to keep me sane.  Me and Matt went out last week to watch the Meteor Shower and look for shooting stars.  The only other time we did that was on his birthday and he told me that that was his favorite day with me.  As silly as it sounds, I was pretty nervous going.  I didn't want to ruin the next possible ""favorite day"" with me.  Haha!  We went on a double date with Ash and Nick, too.  Coming next Friday we're going on a double with Kristen and my brother.  Carrie is going to babysit the kids and we're going to get to finally have our double!  Kristen wants to go bowling so we're going out for dinner then going bowling.  Wednesday, Wayside is having their annual outing and we're going to Hopkinton State Park.  Ash is coming with me :)  Me and Matt also went to Wingaersheek Beach.  I think it's now my favorite beach, possibly ever, although I have a biased when it comes to Virginia Beach.  I told Matt that I want to go to Water Country before it closes, and that's on Sept. 6th, so hopefully we'll get to do that.  Matt's dad is throwing a going away party for Grace going back to school this Sunday so I have that to go to.  I guess you could say I'm a pretty busy girl."

"event","I can't believe I'm leaving for Virginia Beach tomorrow.  I'm a bit worried to drive through the night but if I get the right amount of sleep I should be ok.  I'm going to miss my kitty.  I'm going to pick up a box for her so she doesn't completely hate me while I'm away.  I need to buy an aerobed as well.  My chiropractor told me that I should bring my pillow with me so that my back and neck has consistency.  I was thinking about whether or not I should bring my pilates mat but I figured that if I work out on the beach that should be enough cushion.  I'm really excited to be on the beach every day.  I can't wait to go fishing and walk along the beach, not to mention riding the waves :)


Had a MCI phone call today.  It was an appointment.  It went smoothly.  I'm happy to get phone calls early in the day, but sometimes when it's later in the shift, they definitely seem to get longer.  I really enjoy doing MCI though.  I'm lucky to be able to work with such get people that genuinely care about others, not just a paycheck.

Alrighty, well back to looking up activities to do in Virginia :)"

Even though fall is my favorite season it isn't when it comes to working.  Kids always become more anxious when school starts.  Transitioning from summer fun to hard work is tough for them.

It's true what they say. . .the older you get the shorter your hair is.  I like mine.  It's edgy but still really cute.  I definitely can tell the difference though because I get chilly a lot more.  You never realize how warm your hair keeps you until its chopped off, lol.  I went to the chiropractor today, two days earlier than planned, because I was in excruciating pain on Saturday.  I felt like I had broken my back.  I had to take pain meds to kill it, something I haven't done in a longggg time.  My brother's party was last Saturday too, thankfully before my back started acting up.  I had a lot of fun.  I didn't drink much and still had a good time. . .another way to show I'm growing up.  Virginia Beach is this Saturday.  Things are pretty good right now :)"

Soooo crazy!  I was just talking about this with Matt last night and with my co-workers today during lunch.  Sometimes you feel like you have everything aligned and things are going exactly as planned and then other times you become so analytical.  Your analytical state turns into cynical then the next thing you know you're hating the world and yourself and society.  SOOOO damn funny!"

I feel like it's an easy, relaxing way to get out of the house and do something fun and entertaining for a day.  I'm wondering if it's not smart money-wise though.  Is it worth it?  I guess it really depends on where you're planning on going.

I started thinking about all of this because me and my co-workers had a mini reunion and got into a conversation about cruises compared to day trips and week long trips to one place.  I'll put some more thought into all of this and hopefully I'll figure out a good money saving way to relax and still be able to see the world.  I really want to trvel to far destinations.  Close places too.



I'm a bit tired today.  Hopefully I don't get many calls for MCI.  None would be great too :)  We'll see.  If my phone doesn't ring, maybe after lunch I'll head home for a bit and take a nap.  Silly weather makes me shhhhhleeeeepy :("

"event","I called a client of mine today to confirm a visit with her daughter and she told me her boyfriend got arrested for assaulting her daughter yesterday.  I went to visit the family and I saw the bruises.  Obviously there's more to the story than I've mentioned but it was heartbreaking.  I wanted to cry for the mother.  A mother of 3 at 25 with no father in the picture and not many resources.  Sometimes I get stressed and don't want to work, but it's days like this that remind me exactly why I love my job.

Another client of mine got kicked out of his camp.  He's been at home for this week.  His mother's in Iceland and dad doesn't really know how to deal with him.  He gets flustered very easily.  At first he didn't want to talk to me about what happened, but he eventually opened up.  

It feels good to know that I make such an influence on people's lives.  That it's life changing, not only for them, but for me.  I love my job."

I'm going to do bullets because lots has happened.

- Atlas died.  Short lived but awesome still.  I'm glad I got pics when he was alive.
- Riley's doing well.
- Put in ACs because I just couldn't stand the heat anymore.
- Went to P-Town with Matt and it was amazing!  Going to do a few reviews for White Porch Inn so that we can be entered to win a 2 day stay in the off season.  Definitely my favorite inn I've ever stayed in.
- Going to Virginia Beach in 2 weeks with Matt.  We're driving down there and staying with my dad's side of the family.  SUPER PSYCHED!
- Work is good.  I only have 1 client in crisis at the moment.  Smooth sailing.
- MCI on Fridays has been off the wall!  I'm so glad and lucky to have Abe and John on my team!  If I didn't I'd have gone nuts by now!
- Work made it so that you can work from home.  It's pretty useful.  I like it.
- I got my own Google Voice # 508-656-0119.  It's pretty neat!  Check it out.  It's a free service.
- Things with Jill are going. . .if we didn't live together I think we'd have a chance to salvage our friendship.
- I have a chiropractor now.
- I'm getting my haircut on Saturday.  Matt teased me that every time I get my hair cut it just gets shorter.  True Story.  Im'ma end up with no hair, lol!
- I've been keeping up with seeing my therapist about once every 3 or 4 weeks.  I like her.  She's grown on me.
- I haven't seen my brother, niece, nephew or sister-in-law in a very long time!  I really miss them :(  We're suppose to go to the drive-in and have a double date to go bowling but it hasn't happened yet.
- Monster Hunter is still my main video game at the moment.
- I'm thinking about going back to WoW but I'm sure I'll be picking up StarCraft 2
- Just finished watching Blindside with Carrie.  It was a great movie!

"event","I've never been on vacation with just my boyfriend before and I'm glad this experience was with Matt :)  The first day went unpacked our stuff, walked over to the beach but since it was cloudy we went swimming in the pool, visited the candy shop, bought Atlas (our new pet hermit crab), and then ate at the hibachi grill called Noble House Hibachi.  After dinner we watched Pandorum on my laptop.  The second day we went ate at Dino's, went grocery shopping, swam at the beach, visited an antique store, stopped by the Cape Cod Mall and then ate at Alberto's.  While we were eating an acapella group sang to us.  It was fun :)  We were going to see Toy Story 3 but we were tired not to mention my feet were killing me.  Today we packed up, visited Jewelry by Etta, stopped by an antique store that's now going out of business (Sooo sad because I visited them every year.  I did get a lot of really cool sutff tho!), went to the flea market, stopped by the candy shop again, went to a thrift store and then got massages together.  It was my first time getting a massage!  It was awesome!  I felt great after.  I never knew how cramped my neck was until she was pressed on it.  My lower back and shoulder blade were bad too, both on my right side.  I told her that my scoliosis was getting worse and that's why my back was in pain.  She fixed it right up!  It was neat being in the same room as Matt.  I really enjoyed it.  It was very relaxing and pampering.  After our massages we stopped by this hippie store.  Matt hates hippies and I was joking about it.  Then I started walking towards it and he followed, lol.  We went and ate at Hearth n' Kettle.  I wasn't very pleased with it but it was food.  Their brown rice was wicked good though!  We headed back home after dinner.  I just unpacked almost all of my stuff.  THe only thing I have left to do is my travel bag.  I took atlas out for a bit for Riley to meet and Riley loved him!  I think she thinks he's a toy though, lol.  She was batting him around and he fell.  I ended up putting him back after that but I managed to get some cute pictures with my camera phone.  I'm really tired.  I'm going to go play some Sims 3 to wind down a bit.

For instance, my apartment.  I like my apartment.  I like my town. I like that I live closer to Matt and I love living with two of my best girlfriends.  Although, on the other hand, I feel like the bad outweighs the good.  My cat is terrified because she's gotten attacked twice there and now even if Sheba isn't there she won't come out.  Jill's giving away her cat because she continues to pee in front of my door and refuses to be civil with Riley.  The apartment is still broken and my landlords dislike me.  And per usual, I'm the only one that cares about whether or not our apartment is fixed and/or clean.  The apartment came dirty. . .ok, I dealt with it and started to clean it. . .but I can't keep it clean or finish if no one else is helping out day to day.  Jill's been trying her best, but with her kidney stones I'm not going to push it.  Carrie's always sleeping or gone when I get home.  I work mornings.  Carrie work's nights and Jill works overnights.  We never see each other and I don't want every interaction to be me complaining about the apartment being a pig sty.  I wiped the wall with a sponge the other day and I found out it has a film of dirt on it.  Gross.  Basically the apartment needs a super scrubbing down from top to bottom in every room because unfortunately it wasn't done before we moved our stuff in.  It stressed me out this morning really bad.  I asked Carrie to put the bath mats through the wash with the kitchen towels the other day.  I asked Jill to put away the dishes yesterday.  Simple things.  It never gets done unless I bitch about it again or I do it myself.  I shouldn't even have to ask people to clean things.  If you see it and it's not your mess then pick it up and let them know you did it. . .that way everything stays clean.  Well, if I'm the only one with that philosophy then I'm the only one that's going to be cleaning.  Well, I'm no one's mom and surely not theres.  I'm not trying to be a crazy nazi but why can't people pull their own weight?  No one likes a dirty flithy living space so why is it my responsibility to keep things clean?  It's just so stressful and completely aggravating.  I hate feeling like people take advantage of me but that's what I feel like right now.

"event","In my lifetime, I have had 5 boyfriends that have shaped me into the person I am today.  One that's now my best friend, one that led me down a dark path, one that showed me how complicated things could be even if you're happy and one that broke my heart to the point where I didn't think it was fixable.  After going through all of that pain, suffering and nights of staying awake attempting to sort out my confusion, I finally found Matthew.

He's been the light of my everything.  I've been through enough and it was finally my turn to show this world the wonderful girl I could be.  

After guy three, I told myself that the next guy I dated would be the real thing.  It would be everything a person would want in a relationship. . .care, trust, honesty, worth, happiness, communication and passion.  The only thing I didn't think of was that it took two people to build such a strong relationship.  Two.  Not just me.  I did everything I could to work at it, grow together and love him.  It wasn't enough.  I wasn't the girl he was looking for.  We tried for a year.  I put all my energy into him.  Everything I'd learned along the way.  It still wasn't enough and I tried.  I tried for 8 months thereafter.  Sure, I had my flings along the way but it wasn't the same.  We stayed in touch and then we chose to stay friends.  I wasn't sure I would be able to do it.  It killed me to hear his voice or even see his name pop up on WoW.  It was bad.  I didn't think I would recover.  I thought it was time to move on but my heart ached and had a constant pain channeling through it every second, every breath. . .until. . .until I met Matthew.  

It wasn't until I met Matthew that flipped this switch to reveal this door that I'd never noticed before.  It reminds me of Alice in Wonderland when she has all these doors in front of her and she needs to pick which one to try the key first.  She doesn't look at the bigger picture, so she doesn't see the small door.  The first day we met felt so relaxing to me.  I don't remember the last time before that where I felt like things were ok, that things would be ok.  I've always been a go go go type person and never really had a second to breathe.  I'm not sure I really knew what that meant before him.  If I wasn't working, I was doing something else. . .or two. . .or three something elses.  We talked and I remember thinking to myself, this feels so nice.  We laid in the park and truly enjoyed each other's company.  Everything seemed to come to an abrupt halt at that moment, like the world was stopped and we were just watching it from a distance.  He made me smile and made me feel like I didn't have to worry about anything, ever, anymore.  I was suddenly someone else's center of attention.  I didn't know what to think, what to feel.  I got overwhelmed but I sure as hell didn't want him to see that.  That alone was the one thing that I needed into order to realize that it's impossible for me to do everything and anything to make this world a better place.  I always was the one to put people first and it felt nice to know, that even if it were for a moment, that someone else was putting me first.  He makes me feel <b>euphoric</b>, like I am untouchable.  He makes me feel like I am gold, that he hit the jackpot and discovered the most precious gem of all.  And because of that feeling, I thank not only the other four past boyfriends, but every person that did me wrong and showed me the darkest of things.  If I hadn't experienced those things, I wouldn't feel nearly this great!!"

Last night Matt got into a fight with his brother and Jackie about missing items in the house.  I really try to like her or at the very least try and get along with her but she's impossible.  It hurts me to see Matt so stressed, upset and angry as he's been getting lately because of her.  She has a tough time letting people in and I get that, but at some point she needs to let up.  If she wants solid people in her life she needs to give a little and put some sort of trust in people.  *sigh*  

Anyways, I'm on my way to meet a new client today.  Should be interesting.  I hope she's not as bad as she sounds.  They always sound worse on paper.

"event","Work's been a bit crazy.  I'm thinking it's moreso because I can't focus rather than me actually having too much work.  I have 2 new cases.  I haven't gotten the referral for one of them yet, Jerimiah.  The other is a 5 y/o girl.  I'm excited to have a young one.  I asked for one and I got one! :)

I haven't been able to focus lately because of the prednisone I think.  I stopped taking them because it was causing me to gain weight and I didn't feel comfortable taking such a dangerous drug.  My therapist told me that that's what the taper was for but *shrugs* when do I ever listen?!

My dreams have been getting more vivid lately, probably also because of the prednisone.  I hope they calm down soon though because I haven't been getting like any sleep because of it.  

Erin, my landlord, doesn't like me because she thinks I complain too much.  Maybe if they had the apartment in working order and actually cleaned then we wouldn't been having this problem.  They're repairing our apartment today.

I got Verizon Fios today.  I have to set up the wifi when I get home.  Pretty exciting stuff! :)

Boyfriend has been well.  We're doing great.  It's a bit scary.  Not going to lie.  I get worried that I trust myself too much. . .but on the other hand, I don't trust myself at all.  Go figures.  I don't think I'll ever be completely happy with myself, something I'm still working on."

"event","What makes a person attracted to another?

I keep hearing my friends complain that the person they're into isn't giving them enough attention or doesn't say the right things, etc. etc.

I feel like this happens in a lot of relationships.  So, what makes a person attracted to another?  If they are that aggravated with the person then what makes them stay and hold on?  Is it hope that the person will change their mind suddenly and agree?  What if the other person just honestly doesn't mesh well with the other person?  What if both parties are doing it as a side action to their crazy fucked up lives and that's the only way they feel safe in a relationship?

I've been there.  We know this.  I've had my share of ups and downs and confusion all the way through in several different relationships.  What makes Matthew apart from the rest you ask?  He's charming, sensitive, caring, wise, understanding, honest and most of all he honestly wants what's best for me in everything I do. . .even if he doesn't agree with me.  He sticks by my side and learns with me.  We grow together as a couple and I believe that's very important in a relationship.  I told him once when we first dated, ""the entire female population is missing out"".  I meant every word of that and if I'll have it my way, no one will ever know except myself.

So, why is it that I have Matt and others can't seem to find the Mr or Mrs Right for them?  I guess that's something we all have to learn, shape and conform to as we grow older and wiser.  I sure have learned from seeing others and taught myself on how to wait it out when things just aren't working out for me.  Maybe, just maybe, that's what people are missing in their lives, the notion to wait things out.  I know it gets tough, this coming from one of the most impatient people she knows.  It is tough but I truly believe what they say, things will turn around and when it's your turn it'll be great.  

My life is great.  My life is beautiful.  I have amazing people in my life to share my experiences and to look back and reminisce with.  That's what life is right?  To love and be loved, whether it's family, friends or a partner.

Well friends, I believe in you and one day you'll believe in yourself to find that something that's been missing all along.

I know I have.  I love you Matthew!"

"event","On Monday at 3:30am my wonderful boyfriend drove my ass to the hospital because I had welts and hives all over my body.  I was having difficulty breathing as well.  Come to find out I most likely had Carbon Monoxide Poisoning from the Milford apt.  That's the longer of the short story :P

The cookout at Matt's house last night was nice.  I got to meet two of his high school buddies and another one that lives in Japan.  It was a bit awkward because I didn't know what to say but I was happy to meet him because Matt talks so greatly about him.

There's a dog here at work named Daisy. SOOOOOO cute!  I think she's a whippet.  She makes me really want to have my own family and a boxer.  

Speaking of additions. . .there's a little grey mouse living in my pipes!  Mice freak me out!  I asked Matt to set traps up for me.  Hopefully he doesn't come anywhere near my room.  

Graham fixed our shower last night.  There was a bunch of hair stuck in it.  SUPER gross!  We need a new hair catcher because the one I bought is too big.  Who knew there would be different sizes for hair catchers.  I never had to get one before because all the tubs I used had holed drains.  *shrugs*

Sidenote:  I forgot to put my laundry in for another round in the dryer.  I'll ask Jill if she can run it for me.  

Our dryer is lame.  It's not that it doesn't get hot enough but that it doesn't get good air flow.

I'm pretty obsessed with OTH.  Me and Matt were talking about baby names last night and we both decided that we like Brooke for a girl's name.  He has weird stipulations about names in general. . .like if they rhyme with ""bad"" things or whatnot.  WE were also talking about last names and how girls sometimes hyphenated or they switches their last names between the kids.  I like the traditional taking the husband's last name but who knows.  My mom actually got rid of her middle name and made her middle name her maiden name, taking my dad's last name.  Not that me and Matt are even remotely thinking about having kids or getting married or anything.  It was just nice to have a real conversation.  It's been a while. . .not to mention our amazing luvins, but I'll save you the details *crinkles nose*

I feel like life is going by so fast as I'm getting older.  I'm not sure if I like that or not.  I've always said that if I could pick an age to be for the rest of my life I'd pick 30 but I'm afraid that once I get there I'll feel like I haven't gotten anything accomplished.

I've been seeing my therapist about once every 3 or so weeks.  We talked about grad school and I told her about how I stress about recommendation letters.  I was thinking about asking Shauna but I'm not sure about the other one.  She told me that usually they like to hear about what you've been doing since you've been out of work so someone from your current job is best.  I think I was stressing mostly because I worry that my teachers wouldn't remember me enough to have something to say about me.  It has been a while anyway.  I think I may ask my supervisor to write me one.  I guess I'm not so stressed about that now.  I'm thinking about what I should do about my job.  Do you think I should go part time if I get into grad school or just do night classes?  Maybe night classes. . .although I don't want to get discouraged if I can't do everything at once.  We'll see.  Matt said that he'd sit down with me and figure it all out.  Hopefully if I don't get in for the fall I can at least get in for Spring?  Maybe?  *shrugs*  There's always next year or next summer.  I'm still young, right?  I do want to get in ASAP though.  The faster I get in, the faster I graduate.  

Well, it's lunch time here at Wayside.  Peace."

I just went on a second call because she drew a boy that was holding a gun and knife in his hands that apparently shot a girl.  Even though it was inappropriate for her to draw something like that at school, I think the school overreacted.  We didn't do much with her short of writing out a safety plan.  She was so shy and doesn't have a history of, well, anything.  No drugs, violence -- physical or verbal, she doesn't even swear.  I mean, I understand that there's a lot going on when it comes to young kids nowadays but people should really look into a situation before they get others involved.

As far as the other client we visited.  He did need our help.  He actually has an IHT with Wayside so it made our job a bit easier.

Things are a bit crazy as far as my life as a whole.

I moved to Framingham to help out Jill.  It's me, Jill and Carrie in a two family apartment.  We're on the second floor.  It's not bad.  It's definitely not my favorite though.  It's really busy in Framingham.  I do live across the street from Danielle though and about 10ish minutes from Matt.  It's nice to be able to have my own place and not have to worry about my landlord watching my every move.  Our landlords are pretty cool.  They're super irish and incredibly helpful.

Matt's doing well.  He's been so supportive of everything I do.  He's amazing.  We have our own time on Wednesdays and Fridays now.  It was a bit crazy when we first started only because I was getting used to seeing him every day but it's good for us. . .to keep our relationship healthy and to give ourselves ""sane time"" :)  We've been doing a lot of family stuff with both of our families so it's been really nice.  He's going on vacation with my family for the Cape and Virginia Beach.  

I can't wait to go to Virginia!  It's been soooo long!  I can't wait to wake early to go fishing and/or to walk along the beach.  I'm looking forward to the solitude of grabbing a warm drink and wrapping myself up in a blanket to stand outside on the porch to watch the sun rise with the dolphins jumping.  It's definitely my favorite time/place.  I also can't wait to jump into the ocean and get caught in a wave boogie boarding!  Good stuff!  Maybe Matt'll go parasailing with me.  He'll probably get scared and say no but if I push a little maybe he'll really enjoy himself.

Work has been great!  Some days are super busy but then there's days that I just do one visit and then lounge around for the rest of the day.  It's nice to have a job in where you can make your own schedule, especially when it comes to vacations.  You don't need to coordinate with others to make sure you aren't taking the same time off.  All you do is cancel visits with your clients for that week or so.  I love it.  MCI is really cool.  I haven't gone on a whole lot of calls but the ones I have gone on have been well.  The people I work with are great.  It's neat to watch others on how they work with people. . .the different approaches they do with clients.

Gotta go though.  Need to visit a client.  Chat later."

I meet up with one client today, and tomorrow I meet up with my other.  Monday and Tuesday of next week I'm going to the training in Framingham. . .so I'm really only in the office Wednesday and Thursday, then it's back to doing MCI work.  I got a binder and folders and such in order to keep all my stuff organized.  I also got a new work bag.  It's yellow with a cute design.  It fits my lunch and water bottle too which is nice.  I feel like a real working woman now, lol.  I'm very happy.  For the first time I have normal hours with a normal workload.  

This weekend I'm having a girly L Word Marathon night with Jill on Friday.  I'm going to a wedding with Matt for his friend's birthday on Saturday.  He got us a room for after the wedding so we don't have to drive back late at night.  Valentine's Day is after that and he reserved us a table at Loco's.  I'm really looking forward to that dinner.  I already gave him his Valentine's Day gift (new Kenneth Cole watch) because I wanted him to wear for the wedding and because I was worried he'd buy one on his own.  He says he loves so I guess I picked a good one :)  I wonder what he's getting me.  He said it's very boyfriend gift, hehe.  I told him that I'd be the judge of that :)

"event","Sooo, my new jobs are going great!  Homebase work is a bit overwhelming and stressful but I'm sure I'll be fine.  I've already been assigned to two cases and it's only my 5th day!  I was asked about the first one yesterday and today a woman who I haven't met yet came up to me and said, ""Oh!, *taking my hand to shake it*, you must be Lauren!  I wanted to go over a case you're going to be taking over for me sometime in the next week. . .""  What the fuck?!  I haven't even gone through Orientation yet, nor do I even have an account set up. . .or business cards to hand to clients.  I have an extention, but that's pretty much it. . .and they want me to take two cases without being able to access e-mail or paperwork?!  *sigh*  Of course I said ok, but I don't really have a choice. . .I'm new.  I know I can do it but way to throw a person into their job.  I wouldn't mind so much if it were residential because it's mostly observing, but going into people's homes without knowing anything about them or their family is a bit different.

Today is my first day for MCI.  My actual hours are 10-6 (12-8 while training if needed).  This is more of an on-call emergency service, kind of like PES.  So, basically if I don't get any calls. . .I'm hanging around for the day free to do whatever I want.  I get paid more for this position because you're on-call and it's more crisis intervening rather than working with families.  Sounds pretty good to me.  This morning I went to a training on Ehtics and Risk Management and I was told that if I got a call I'd have to meet up with John and go with him to shadow.  I never got a call so I stayed for the whole training.  It was by far the most informational training I've been to in a long while.  Well, after the training, I went to Framingham (my office on Fridays is Framingham) to eat lunch then meet up with John.  I ate lunch and then went to meet up with John, which wasn't as easy as I thought.  I couldn't find John, nor had I met him yet so I had to ask a supervisor who I work with at the Milford office to help me find him.  Well, I eventually ran into him, we introduced each other and he went over a few pieces of paperwork in which only took about 20 minutes.  Now, we're just waiting for a call. . .no call yet.  Soooooooooo, here I am.  Bored.  I'm thinking MCI sounds easier.  It seems a little bit more familiar to me than the homebase work.  Although, I am curious in how the homebase work turns out and if I end up liking it.  I do like the Milford office better too and if I switched to all MCI, my home office would be here in Framingham.

I'll keep you updated on that :)  

I have a lot going on in the next few weeks so I'll try to stay connected.  I went to a Bruins game last night with Matt, Christian, Mark, and Ash.  It was a good time even though the Bruins lost in a shootout.  They seem to always lose in shootouts.  We went out to eat at Fours after.  It was yummo! Naturally, I got the buffalo chicken nachos.  They were fantastic as usual!  We ended up taking a wrong turn on the way back and ended up about a half hour out of the way back home so I didn't get much sleep.  

Tonight, I'm going to meet up with Jill.  I haven't seen her in a long time, so we have a ton of catching up to do.  We're going to go to Olive Garden for dinner then to see Dear John at the movies.  I hope it's good.  Also, I hope I don't pass out in the movie theater.  I won't see Matt for the rest of the day which is unusual for us.  I figured I'd let him have tonight alone since I knew he worked early and I wouldn't be back home till late.  I usually can't sleep unless he's next to me, but I think between not getting sleep last night and being up all today and all tonight later, I'm going to pass the f out when I get home.  I'll most likely end up sleeping in tomorrow.  I promised myself I'd work out since I don't have anything to do.  That's all I have planned for tomorrow which is nice.  It'll be the first day in a while for the next few weeks that I'll have completely free.

I think that's all for now."

"event","We now have gotten a gym membership together and are trying to eat healthier.  We spent $404 at BJ's.  We got a FoodSaver.  It's fun to use :)

I got a personal trainer.  First day's Wednesday.  It's Nick, not Nick Nick, but Nick (the guy I used to like before).  

Matt met my family. . .not the whole fam but Mum, Dad (again), Neil, Kristen, David and Olivia. . .everyone 'cept Leonard and Amy.

Work's been ok.  Struggling with money a bit because I make crap.  It's Staff Appreciation Week this week so each day of work is a new theme.  Tomorrow we have an International Potluck and it's also Pajama Day.  

I met Matt's stepmom, dad and sister.  Me, Matt and Grace went on a crazy adventure. . .let's just say we went to go walk thru a corn maze and ended up with a stolen apple :)  His dad reminds me of my oldest brother and his stepmom reminds me of a jesus loving Kristen.  I liked his sister.  She was cute.

Today, Matt found a snail.  We're going to make a home for it and I'm going to make a mini garden with a flower and a broken flower pot.  I think it'll be cute.  What's a good name for it?  He didn't decide if it was a boy or girl so. . .I can't really think of anything right now.

I relapsed the other day.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be on me physically and emotionally.  Matt was really supportive of me.  I felt bad like I was letting him down and being a disappointment.  Sometimes I feel really pressured to be a good girlfriend to him, not only because I want to be, but because I'm his first real one.  I didn't tell Christian though.  I'm not sure how that would turn out.  He's been thru every other time I've relapsed so I'm sure it'd turn out ok but getting there. . .I'm sure there'd be lecturing of some sort. . .I guess kind of like how I lecture him about speeding and drinking.  I have therapy this week though so I'll be able to talk about that more there.  I really think the only reason I didn't continue to do it and relapse ""badly"" is because I had Matt and was able to get myself to remind myself that it was only one time and that I had control of changing it.  I ended up calling trainer Nick that day in order to ask him about personal training.  That's big for me.  If this were even two years ago, I would have drank, drugged, sexed on top of binging and purging all over again.  So, yeah, this is good for me.  We'll see how this personal trainer works for me.  The others were good so I have high hopes for this. . .now getting the money to pay for this. . .it'll have to come out of my savings >.<

Can't remember if I mentioned it before or not but there was this boxer that I wanted.  I asked the vet if it was ok for me to get one with Riley being in the same house.  She said it was fine and if anything would make Riley have a longer life.  Said as long as the dog was younger than Riley it'd be good.  Well, I had my eye on this one boxer at Puppy Patch and, long story short. . .I finally decided that I was going to buy it and was going to write them an e-mail to let them know. . .and someone had bought it earlier that day.  Sucked.  Still want a boxer pup.  Matt looked up breeders for me.

Going to Hilloween with Matt, Ash and Nick (her bf) on Halloween night.  Was suppose to go to a party after but that fell thru so plans are up in the air now.  Nov. 1st we're going to Six Flags.  Should be fun!  I haven't been to Six Flags at all this year.  We were wondering if they were going to do FrightFest that day since it's only a day after Halloween and it's still a weekend.  Dunno.

Hmmm, I think that's all for now.  I'll keep you updated.  Ciaos."

We've spent basically every day with each other since we've been together. I told him he was my mesh (that guy I always talk about that if all my past boyfriends were meshed into one, for all their best qualities, I'd have the perfect boyfriend).  Well, I found him!  And it's about fucking time!

We are complete goofballs when we're with each other and there's not one moment when I don't have a ridiculous smile on my face.  

I just wanted to quickly update you :D"

This is one of the only reasons why I love New England. . .they rock sports!  Although, I'm really only a hockey fan, I don't mind watching other sports.

mmm, I guess also because of the four seasons.  I could never live in a place without four seasons.  They're all beautiful in their own way.  




I get to see Matt tomorrow :D  Soooo excited!  I hope tomorrow's as good as today was!  I get to see Danielle AND Matt. . .double whammy, lol.  Can't wait!

"event","<i>( I'm sure you've heard the chime before of him telling others that he's ""awesome"" and ""king"". . .""better than anyone else"". . .)</i>



So time is just an object 
placed upon my hands. . .
I wasted worn and washed it
until all that's left is ash

I filled in the spaces with regrets
memorized your words
and sentences

I overplayed your royal song
until these eyes 
run red and raw

I sent the letter sincerely
Into a bottle out at sea
gave you my word 
but you won't believe
your every move speaks infamy

I cursed you out
crossed out your face
and though I love you
right now it's hate

I gave you everything of me
sacrificed my heart
so you'd be complete

I face a fall
all just to save
recover, rebuild 
your shattered name

It was never enough to compliment
generously spend all my respect

I paid my dues to you the King
notice your weathered face of fame
of all my strides, most went unseen
And through it all, it blurred my name

under your brow
I'm unworthy
just know you would not exist 
if it wasn't for me
No polished throne
would bear your name
You'd be just a tool in this moonlight charade

So into the shadows 
where I house the pain
your words have inflicted
in their selfish ways

Your words still are beauty
and oh so sweet
but the lack there of
has thus made me weak

So here I stand half a lass
while your heart of stone
only stares past
the weary tears of lost respect
my love for you, froze to regret

I'd die for you
for just a glance
a star of hope
a chance to last

So as you sit on your pedestal
put down your chin
cause you're the fool

remember me as your last chance
to save yourself
from selfishness

Now all that's left
of your medieval play
is an unsigned will
and a new grave laid

So ask yourself
My dear King,
was it worth 
the loss
covered in the seams?

So sorry it had to end this way
but beauty does fade
and so will your name!

So swallow your pride
and show some respect
for the ones who have died
for your acknowledgement."

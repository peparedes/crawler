"event","Wow, been awhile. Sorry for whoever keeps an interest in this... prolly nobody but anyways moving on. Life update...lets see. Michael is still in Korea, and in fact LOVES it over there, It almost seems like he doesn't want to come home...don't blame him. He actually has become quite the p.i.m.p. over there. He is only like 1 of the 3 guys who went over there, the other like 5 are girls. So lol yeah he's digging it.
   Besides that, my dad has come to the conclusion that we are amish...yes...amish. Besides getting rid of our furniture....besides one lone c hair that sits in our living room and a coffee table. I believe that are looking for new furniture. But basically our living room/ house is a baron wasteland. ALso, dad tells me on thursday that he thinks we watch to much tv and has gotten rid of our satalite TV....WHAT THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSE TO DO THEN>?! So yes, dad thinks we are going to be amish, ill update when i get issued a bonnet and make my own clothes.
  Work is cool, I like it alot, simple and easy. Me and Kraig are still together. It will be 5 months on friday. I'm really happy. which is rare. I'm also doing exceptionally well in all my classes.
   The National Guard came to my house, they are trying to re cruit me....yeah right. I""m not getting sucked into that hell hole, im' not that stupid. I might look into Coast guard. but thats just for kicks and giggles. 
    My great grandfather died thursday. I was pretty sad he was such a awesome guy. 91 years old. He was cool, I visited him every other weekend with my mom. But I didn't cry. IT was his time, and I understand.
     Last sunday, my mom was in a car accident on here way up to see me from Ohio. She is okay. and so is her frined who was with her, But her jeep is totalled. Her car  slid on ice and then hit 3 trees and her car slid down a 50 foot deep gully off the side of the road. I""m so glad that she is okay and so is her friend. I don't know what I would do if anything horrible would have happened. I would have been lost, my mom is the only adult I trust, and I love her so much.
 peace&love

Last night I spent the night with nicole. we snuck out and went to her boyfriends house, Chris Bottorff. After we picked up Kraig of course. I fell asleep on chris's floor with kraig and we left around 4 in the morning. Kraig is great...We've been going 0ut of over 2 months now, and I've never told him I loved him yet, I want too, because well I really do feel that I love him. I should tell him...I just feel that if I wait to say it then i know that i mean it.

"event","JEez, havn't updated in awhile. Ever have that feeling when you realize everything around you is just crumbling? Well, thats what I feel like right now. I almost want to cry..But I won't-i refuse. But the point of the matter is that seems that everyone lately is in a mood to judge...and what they judge they don't understand. SO therefor making their judgement ...Void. It makes me sooo mad. Thats all dad ever wants to do is just judge anyone around him, expecially people that are close to me. He judges Kraig, cause 1. He thinks he knows him, and 2. He has ""reliable"" resources that Kraig is a bad person. Well I hate to burst dad's bubble but not everyone on the planet has to live up to his expectations, and I don't have to live up to anybody's expectations but MY OWN. APparently I'm not as dumb as dad thinks I am, obviouslly, because my expectations for people aren't insane and im smart enough to know when sombody is a truely a bad person. Why does dad think he needs to control the universe, all he is doing lately is just being on a stupid Surpreme Power hungry-power trip, and its getting annoying. He thinks he can control things that he has no control over what so ever, and 1. NEVER WILL. -_-
 On another note, Casey's mom decided that I can't be trusted and told Casey that she can't hang out with me anymore after school....because Casey smelt like cigarette smoke from Kraig and Brandon smoking in my car...which is absolutely stupid, and naturally she wouldn't tell me this to my face(her mother that is) She prefers to say mean things about me behind my back....which is just peachy. Some people are just two-faced. I swear Casey's mom will be all nice to me, but now that i know what she thinks it feels like whenever she looks at me she sees this horrible person who is gonna taint Casey. ....Every bad thing sombody does who doesn't get punished, it feels like I'm taking all their punishment...-_-. 
 This might come as shock to some people, but they should keep in mind that not everything in the world that sucks IS MY FAULT!...

Well yesturday the letter came in the mail for parents about it (I got caught at school). Well yeah....Lets just say I'm grounded and I'm stupid for skipping( no need to lecture me please) Anyways, wasn't very pretty at all.
  Anyways, besides that. Me and Kraig are still cool :) which is awesome. He's awesome. lol. It's so weird havn't sombody who would do anything for you...Last night he rode his bike all the wa to my house at midnight just to sit on the side of the road adn talk to me. It was cool. ^_^ 
 I figured I'm gonna have alot of down time in the next month or so (thats how long im grounded) So might as well pick up on my grades which seem to be staggering..........*rolls eyes* Oh well, nothing like some good motivation...And GREEn DAY. Wow, I've been hardcore into Green Day, and Sublime and just a tad bit of Tom Petty lately. I still listen to the pumpkins from time to time. But man...Green day just blows my mind. Not really in a mood to make a long post...just kind of Blah today. Some drama at home but I'll admit is my fault lol...
  I talked to Aaron a few days ago...I guess things improved for him....I guess.. Well he hasn't smoked pot in a week in a half just because he has to pass a piss test for his job to go on full time and he got a cell phone. But man, he kept interagating me...It was so annoying...I called Bonnie and he was there and he kept saying ""why didn't you bring Kraig and Brandon(brandon is Bonnie's boyfriend, he hates aaron) and well WTF! DUH I told him it would be weird if kraig was there with him and me...which is true and he said ""well just because we broke up doesn't me it has to be weird between us"" which is understandable but he wanted kraig and brandon out there so bad...You can so tell he wanted to start somthing which pisses me off...*shrug* I was sitting across from him outside on the porch and he kept making references like ""When we were together"" and ""Since we'v been apart"" and he apparently is very proud of himself that he has gotten into crystal meth, crank, cocaine and all this horrible crap that i wouldn't be caught seen within a 20 mile radius of...You know what...good for him.

It kind of reminds of peter pan ya know...like when they say ""Never grow up"". Nobody I guess really means to grow up. It just happens. Everyone just wants to be that little kid forever and never have to deal with any problems and just be carefree and innocent...But then theres that one day when you roll out of a bed and your back hurts and you look in the mirror and realize your too late, your an adult..you never wanted to grow up and eventually have to die...I didn't want to grow up. But i can't help it -_- <U><EM>Michael grew up without me</EM></U> T_T. Michael looks different, he acts different, he even feels different when I gave him a hug. Mom came unglued when she gave him a hug. She just started bawling... I don't blame her. I held it all in. I miss him already-again. This time he's not gonna be so close...He's gonna be in Maryland. It doesn't seem like he was in fort Knox very long...but I mean you can't stop it, the future just keeps coming and its not slowing down. Next after Maryland, MIchael has to go to New York to be shipped out for Iraq. I don't want to imagine how that day will be....It will be just like the day he left from home....Everyone just crying and sobbing and just trying to find somthing to hold onto. But this time...It will be different...because we all know theres a chance he might not come back.. It doesn't seem fair does it...? Take america's youth, take every bit of character and individuality they have and turn them into just blank...things... But deep down they have that little feeling that still makes them want to go home to their mother when they are scared....Everyone was happy today. Watching all the guys in formation and then when they were given the order that they could go see their familys....Watching all those guys just run up to their familys and just hug them for minutes at a time, not letting go....Everyone so happy to see eachother and just everyone crying and just holding onto their kids...... who weren't kids anymore... </P>

  I think...I KNOW I'v changed alot since last year...Its funny...not like laughable funny, like weird funny. I mean ...I dunno I think this year I'm more independent and I mean I'm ME, nobody else. Not bits and pieces of different people i'm around. I'm actually >ME< And it feels good. 
  Michael graduates from basic training Sept. 8th. I can't wait to see him, I'v missed him so soo soo much. I remember the night he left....We were all sitting on the couch waiting for the recruiter to get there....Michael gave me a hug goodbye. I watched Mona go nuts and try to get him to stop and come back and dad was holding her back...I watched him pull out the driveway..and I went to the woods and cried my eyes out and just sat and sat forever. After that I called Nikki, I had to get out of the house everyone had such bad karma...So I sat in waffle house parking lot waiting for her crying in my car...-_-. I can't wait to see him.

   Last night , I picked  up Kriag and Brandon and we went out to Bonnies and sat in the Cemetary and hung out...Then we left. I pick up Kraig, Brandon, and Chris every morning for school adn take them home...thus where most of our dumbass adventures. Maybe not so much adventures....just...lol us being together and being stupid...lol.

   I""v realized lately that I'm not like other girls...I mean I look at the people I actually hang out with....they are all boys except 3 or so....Boys are just so much cooler to hang out with. I mean...The last time I actually had a girl in my car and we were gonna hang out was like over the summer. But shes like my best female friend, Nicole Inman. *shrug* I dunno i just walk around the hallways at school and I hear other girls conversations and im like ""geez, who talks abotu that shit, its stupid"" and I walked up to kraig and i was like really confused that people actually talk about stupid crap like that...weird.

So we drove around for awhile and then we decided to go and pick up Bonnie. We drove around awhile, ate some pizza...Then hung out around st.paul with mom and went to the train tressles and sat there forever just hanging out with my mom! lol! After that we decided to go see ""THe crazy deer"" which is this deer in this cage out in hidden paradise that was attacked by somthing when it was little. Its really a sad site but it was still fun to have somthing to do. We went down there and started petting and playing with the deer and then we started feeding them Faygo lol....Deer really like Faygo....lol. Well Bonnie started feeding it some and she accidently got some in its nose. and then the best thing in the world happened. Brandon was standing in front of the deer while bonnie was doing this and it sneezed it ALL OUT ON BRANDON! IT had to have been the funniest thing in the entire world, i literally hit the ground laughing, along with Bonnie. 
  After that, we went down the docks at the stone quary, Then the conspiracy started...lol. Kraig and Brandon were talking about throwing me ina nd that ran the idea past my mom adn she said ""Go ahead, give it to her!"" and so they grabbed my hands adn feet and threw me in the lake....lol. It was alot of fun...We had to go back to my house so I could change clothes... Today was just awesome.
I love my mom...lol Deer are hilarous when they sneeze...lol.

I told her she can't touch me and she better never touch me again.

 Besides that, school is going well. I looked dead today, i was soo out of it and tired.

I was up pretty late last night on the phone with Kraig. He's a good friend. Somebody said that were all getting drug tested this year. Which I doubt nobody has said anything else about it. *shrug* I guess I'll find out tommarow. Not like I have anything to worry about anyways. 
   N.caralina wasn't to bad. I learned how to surf that was cool. Got pretty bruised up. But it was still fun. N.caralina is cool and all...but It's not where i want to be. I want to be here in Indiana with everyone I love to be around. I'm grounded from the phone. Cause the phone bill...whatever. screw it. They deflated my car tires...which is just annoying. But whatever. Bonnie called me yesturday...we talked for awhile. It was funny, I got the update on what all happened and what all the crazy crap i did at my spontanous homecoming party. Apparently I tried to ride Bonnies dog, Bear. Bear is a huge ass dog too....like part wolf/german shep. hah. Anyways...Paul's mad at me because i drink...I mean. I guess he has a point. But I mean...I don't know I feel like I might be a little stubborn...I hate it when people want to tell me how to live even though I know they are just looking out for me. But somtimes people take it a little far and make it sound like I'm to stupid to live. Paul doesn't do that though. I guess I dont know. He yelled at me last night, but for once i didn't have anything to say about it. My mind was a complete blank and there was no words.
   I just have two different groups of friends...blah. Me and Bonnie were talking yesturday about ways to get rid of Sarah out of our entorage cause she knows to many cops. Like shes a big trouble maker and all the sudden she keeps coming around like 24/7 and shes so annoying and everyone hates her. If a cop even sees Sarah with you he'll pull you over cause Sarah is trouble. Which sucks. 
    The crowd of friends wants to come up to moms for fall break for a couple days...Me and Bonnie decided to get the entorage up there and just chill. So i Guess the invitation list is pretty Cool, Wesley, Chris, Nicole, Brandon, Bonnie, Aaron and I dont know if Shane will want to go or not though. But like Bonnie said that we should invite Aaron cause if me and him are gonna be friends, might as well do it ya know? Which is cool.
     But thats all i think i have to say right now. I'm kind of spacing out from the cough medicine....

I don't think many people understand me...I'm just weird I guess. But I think I like it....Just allways confusing people... I like being what nobody expects.
     Then i took Jarrod and Maddy home and went back and picked up kraig. Then...made a quick trip to Mcdonalds. Then the skatepark...I swear. Everytime I show up there, a whole buch of people just flock to my car...lol I know to many people. Even kraig noticed it how they do it. Ryan Louis was there, he gave us money to go buy him cheeseburgers, so we went lol. Came back and just talked to a few people. Jake was there, he wants me to come back tonight. Doubt I'll be aloud though. Cause were leaving for N. Caralina tommarow...naturally there would be a hurrican coming directly at the place wer are going *rolls eyes* WHO PREDICTS A FUN TRIP? ...right. I'm hungry....Arby's sounds good right now.

"event","I spent the night with Nicole Inman last night. I ended up at her house at like 9 last night. We went to waffle house and got my paychecks and stuff and then we went to Adams...weird. But I always end up there. Looking at the same people. But I never get tired of it. Theres just somthing funny about it I guess. Went to see if Ryan and Chris were home. But neither were. Well Ryan was sleeping. But Chris was at Wesleys. So me and Nicole and then we picked up Jamie(chris and Ryan's sister) and went to Wesleys. Nicole went in alone to find her boyfriend, while me and Jamie sat in the car...until we noticed Wesley hsa a trampoline. So in the middle of the rain me and Jamie ran out and started jumping on the trampoline.lol. By that time we ended up knocking on Wesleys door cause Nicole was taking forever. Aaron was sitting on Wesleys living room. Not one word to me,naturally. But he kept looking at my funny like he was shocked that I'm already back in Adams so soon. Why does he think he scars me...Like I should be horrified to be in the same room as him. We were leaving when Matt pulled up so we crammed Matt and Jamie back in my car and went to harvest to cash my checks. Took matt and jamie back, and crammed everyone in Wesleys room....Slightly uncomfotable. Jamie, Chris, Wesley, Matt, Me, Nicole, and Aaron all crammed in one room. It was nutz. Oh well, Aaron was gonna ride with us to Harvest but he didn't want to leave Wesley by himself. I should just buy a freakin Van. 
    We stayed up really late this morning...till like 4. I had to be home at 11 this morning. That was fun driving when ur tired as hell...But I made it.
   Nicole might be able to go with me to N.caralina. Her grandma might be getting ebtter. I really hope she does get better, not just because i want Nicole to go on vacation with me, just cause Nicole and her grandma are close. ANd nicole is a good friend. That would be so cool. I dont think Bonnie is gonna be able to go with me to the Caralina's, her mom doesn't really know me that well. I was only at their house once...and I don't even remember why lol.

"event","Last night I was to tired to post alot. But I'll fill in the holes i guess. Nothing to at the moment anyways. I'm babysitting again...blah. My parents better start paying me for this. Cause I'm laid off from work so yeah kind of short on money as of right now. 
    I was really depressed last night. I was walking around my yard in the middle of the night barefoot listening to The Smashing Pumpkins(naturally). And just staring at the moon. I don't know why. It just seemed peaceful. And it turns out it made me more depressed. I Don't know why I've been so depressed lately. Things are starting to chill out around the house. Mona quit drinking so thats a good thing. But I dunno, theres just one more thing that doesn't seem right. I dunno. I want to cry because the Aaron thing. But I can't it just doesn't work. It makes me just sad enough to where I can't cry. Which I guess I cried enough for him already. But I don't know...I don't know anything I guess. 
    But I came back in the house and I sat down next to dad at his computer and told him I didn't feel very happy. And I kind of got a little misty. Dad just asked me what was the amtter with me. And I just told him I was gonna go drive around. Well, I started driving around. And When your by yourself you really start to feel how you feel? Like you pay attention to everything your feeling. And I couldn't even describe it. It was just this empty feeling. I just want to go back to when I didn't have that feeling...Maybe I've had this feeling and I just never really let it show..I have no clue. 
    But I drove around ST.paul for a little bit. Then I decided to go to the Skate Park and talk to Delmar. Cause Delmar and me had a fight there at the sk8 park a couple weeks ago. He was really mad at me for going out with Aaron. I asked him Why it pissed him off so bad, and he said becuse All last year he just told me about what a bad person he is, and he's like a lowlife and isn't right for me, and I just turned around and dated him anyways and then whatever He told me last year didn't mean shit to me... It did mean somthing to me..But maybe Delmar's one of those people who doesn't believe in second chances. But I had to go talk to him and tell him that me and Aaron were not together anymore. But he wasn't there. So i just pulled in and sat in my car and just sat there for awhile. And I was getting ready to leave, Chris Parker walked up to my car and was talking to me...mainly asking me what I was doing there. So I got out of the car and was talking to him and he and I played basketball together. It was funny. apparently sports isn't my thing. Cause i blasted him in the eye with the basketball....
     I was over there for a little bit. Then Jake showed up and yelled at me to come and talk to me. So I went over there and was talking to him, and his friend Chad. I ended up hanging out with them for awhile. Jake told me I should quit work at Waffle house and basically go whereever he goes. And that he just wanted to drive around with me all night. Chad was pretty cool too. We talked about music alot. Apparently everytime I go to the skate park I turn into the Taxi. But I don't really care. So far everyone out there owes me money. Which isn't to shabby lol. Just have to go and get it. So far theres at least 20 bucks. lol. Oh well...I need to get ahold of nicole. So i Can ask her if she wants to go to N.Caralina with me for about a week in a half, if she isn't aloud. Then Bonnie said she would go...thats cool.

Still obsessive over the pumpkins...they are just wow awesome. his voice is so different and unique. It just awesome. Anyways, Mom called me this morning asking me why Nicole Inman called her, I guess Nicole called me yesturdya morning and mona wouldn't let her talk to me and so Nicole hung up and called my mom and was telling her how much mona is a bitch...I thought that was really amusing.
  Besides that, Still decided when/if I'm up for dating again. I see no point anymore really. It won't work. Never works. It's just basically a waste oft ime. It might make you happy for awhile but in the end its just hell. Why do people put themselves through that? I dunno...I'm not up for being temporarly happy and having my happiness depend on somebody else. I just want to be happy all the time...but then I don't want to be lonely...Life's annoying.

But it was to run errands for him. I didn't care, I got to leave. Talked to Matt a little bit at taco bell. I really miss school and talking to my friends all the time. Summer is always depressing for me. It was depressing last summer too. For the same reason too. Aaron. Its ALWAYS him. For some reason there is always feelings that I have for him, no matter what. They won't go away. It's like somthing out there is not letting me just get over it. Today I about cried finnaly about it...but I tried. But they wouldn't just come out...It was a song too that started it. Weird, but it was Purple Rain..by Prince. That song is classic even though its by...ahem Prince. But that song is just great for him. Anyways...I played guitar alot too today.
   Me and Mona are talking again, thats a good thing. Sooner we started getting over all that crap that happened friday the sooner i get my car keys back. I really do care about us getting along agian. I mean she is my family...And might as well make the best of us living together and dealing with everyones differences i guess *shrug*. Besides that Dad planned a almost two week vacation to the caralinas. He said I can surf as long as I want..that sounds good right now...surfing. Just letting go...He even said I can take a friend, And I decided I'm gonna take Nicole INman. Shes just one of my coolest friends, basically family to me. And dad's letting me take his truck so that way I can have my own vehicle down there to drive so me and nicole don't have to be stranded at all. So were gonna hit the beachs , and start surfing.....ahhh it will be gooooooood. I hope everything will settle down, and I can come back home from letting go in the caralinas to just a clean slate....that would rule.

And i dont know what it is, but i know I miss it. If that makes since....But it does to me. I miss Michael. Of course I do, he graduates from basic on the 8th of August. Then he comes home for a little bit, and then he goes to Adavance and then..more training for Iraq. Why did it have to be him? Dad and Mona with their smart moves got me laid off from work. My boss said that I need two weeks to recooperate and fix all my distractions. I didn't ask to be laid off. SO basically I have no money for two weeks and Tuesday I go back to Hell.SHould be fun. I want to see Aaron soooo bad. Maybe not so much as seeing him, just hearing his voice.I know that sounds ridiculious. But I need somone to talk too. He he makes the most since to talk too. ""Scream my lungs out trying to get to you."" I wonder if he really even cares about me. I mean he never really makes an effort to step out and call me or anything maybe thats maybe...cause hes 20 and hes more adult than i am right now and that feels right to him. And since I'm used to other guys who just are so up ur ass they have nothing better to do? I dunno. -_- I miss him. I might as well look for another job when i get back home...My car has alot of my stuff in it. Friday i was so mad I cleared out alot of things from my room and they are all in my trunk. Mona made a phone call to mom on that one telling her that whatever she told me how to keep it together didn't work cause my car was packed. THey wouldn't let me drive down to grandmas this weekend. Prolly thought I would run to Aaron, or run away in genral. Dad told mom he was only doing this cause he cares me about. Mom told him to tell me that himself. Which Im still waiting for. And mom said if he keeps treating and talking to me like I'm nothing then I will run somwhere, or to somone I shouldn't be with or a place i shouldn't be. Mom wasn't trying to make aaron that person. She likes him. Dad made that person Aaron. Aaron is Harmless. Dad doesn't see Aaron like that. Dad wouldn't even agree to meet him...-_-. I need a new life. I dont want to go to N.caralina. Mona and Dad are using it as a place to run from their mistakes...And if they treat me like that I'm gonna take it as me being their mistake...So I should stay and let them have their dream life alone.

My stepmom called me today asking me what my plans were for the weekend, so expecting the wrong answer as they do and i didn't want to disappoint them. I told them i was going to moms until saturday and be back late and then Sunday was The Dead concert. WRONG. She said that I'm not going ot the concert anymore because I was suppose to work sunday, BUT they didn't know that i called and my boss said that if i could find another girl to cover for me them I could. WELL I DID. Well i hadn't called my boss yet to tell her that. So my stepmom called her she said i was suppose to work which would have been the right answer cause i havn't told her that i had a girl to cover for me yet. So now mona(my stepmom) thinks that im ditching work. So she said I'm defiantly not going and now i have to sell my ticket. and then repay the person who bought it for me. Which totally pisses me off. And i called dad cause Mona called my BEST FRIEND and bitched at her and pissed her off and told to stop being my friend basically.So i Called dad adn told him I was going to moms this weekend and I wasn't coming back...He hung up on. So i went down to my room and cleaned it out and packed up my car and told them if they wanted the car back they could pick it up at my grandmas. Well they took the keys from me so I couldn't leave. They said I'm coming back sunday and that was the it. So now my mom has to abide by that...which really sucks. I told mona i couldn't stand her. Which basically is the truth. So I've been on the phone all day with my friends and they are all freaking out. Started basically a man-hunt for my boyfriend...nobody found him. But hes at work now and I can't get to him. Nikki called around looking for him. Nikki Called chris and chris and ryan were looking for him, and then Nicole(chris's gf) was looking for him, and then we called Bonnie and Bonnie was looking for him and still nobody found him cause everyone was freakingo ut because they thought i was going to Ohio to stay, but NOW im' not and Aaron is totally clueless. I feel bad for him. He doesn't know bout all this shit and its not fair that doesn't like him and dad hasn't even met him and wont' give him a chance. I feel bad for Aaron He doesn't deserve to hear that from ym dad when dad doesn't know him. Its just total crap....I miss Aaron. I want to talk to him. So no Dead Concert. Weekend ruined, job's tainted. Life's Tainted. I told them I didn't want to leave for N.caralina and they don't even care. Well I think thats it...jeez I'v posted alot lately....-_- I miss Aaron.

She told dad about him adn then said i could do better. Dad is worthless. I hate him. I hate my family. I don't want to do better. Right now I'm perfectly content with my life. I have liked Aaron for over an a year. We had somthing a year ago, and then a year later it came back and it all fell into place just right. That's whats cool about it. Last night it stormed like crazy so I left cause nobody would hear my car start. I went to Aarons' It was kind of cute/movie weird cause I showed up on his doorstep soaked and its storming???DOesn't that happen in movies?? lol It was just funny. We hung out in his room, then was on the porch for awhile, and then we drove around the country watching the lightning and talking. He showed me a poem he wrote. It was really good, and I told him that but i dunno if he believed me lol.
   So now, dad and mona are gonna give it their best shot to split us up. Its not gonna work. They are just like ""We need to get you away from Aaron"" they make me sooo mad. I told mom about it she is still pissed off about it too she can't believe dad is being an ass like he is. So she just said ""Bring Aaron and you guys can live with me"" Simple enough. Hell, I would do it. Just if it comes to that. FINE ill do it. 
   The Dead concert is Sunday. I dunno I have my ticket but I might scalp it cause maybe Aaron will come to Ohio with me this weekend or somthing to meet mom. Mom really wants to meet him. It would be so awesome if he came. Spending athe weekend together without worrieing about dad. That would just rock. Mom is awesome I love her.

I either don't drink and then when i get sad I drink cause ""Well you only live once"". WELL, last night about did it for me. Hardcore. I got drunk with some buddies, Ryan and Nicole I. out in the Adam's Cememtary. I sobered up first though, those two ended up becoming totally wasted. I remember most of it though. Ryan scared me alot. Not like jumped out at me or whatever...just some things he said to me. I started walking out into this clearing part of the graveyard where there was no stones and i just collasped out there and started crying. Ryan followed me out there and sat on my legs so I would stop walking around. He started talking to me about God, and how there is no god and all his beliefs. He said that this is just nothing, there is no reality this is the ""in between"" as he put it. But then again he was a little drunk but sober enough to sound smart i guess. Well when he startedtalking about God i started crying even more and I sat up and he told me to keep looking at the stars and it will be okay...He pushed my hair out of my face and told me i was to beautiful to cry. Ryan has never done that before. After that I got freaked out and i started leaving the cemetary and nicole and ryan followed me like a mile or so away (drunk no less) to Aarons house cause i wanted to see him really bad , cause he wasn't hoem earlier for me to see if he wanted to come with us. Well I ended up at his house and I realized I was alone again. I paced in front of his house like a half hour (still drunk, but bordering sober) and I went back for Ryan and Nicole. and They had passed out in the middle of hte road.....in the dark. I was soo scared I started crying and I helped nicole up because they passed out on this little bridge that went over a creek. Well we helped Ryan up and he fell backwards of the bridge and me and nicole were screaming and crying and I took off runnign to Aarons house and i was throwing rocks at his window and ringing the door bell and knocking and nobody would answer I was soo scared I had no idea what to do. I went back to get nicole to help me wake Aaron up because I couldn't do it. Nicole was crying and she said she was gonna stay there with Ryan. We got Ryan back up and I ran all the way back across town to my car(sober now) and drove and picked them up and we drove to Aaron's and locked Ryan in the car and Nicole (still wasted) suggested that we climb on Aaron's roof and knock on his window. SOOOOOOO we climbed on Aarons roof,and sat up there and cried cause we were so scared and made it around the house and woke Aaron up and he got everything fixed for us and gave me nad Nicole sweaters. And well we took Ryan home finnaly and then we went to the carwash to clean out Ryans puke from the inside of my car. and nicoles puke, and well I didn't puke IN my car.After that we went to Speedway for donuts and coffee, by that time it was like 5 in the moring and we went back to Adam's park and stayed to watch the sun come up. We were suppos eto go back to Aaron's that morning but we ended up just going to NIcoles to sleep. Nicole found blood in her hair, and there was blood on my shirt and we had no clue whereit came from...we called Ryan this morning but he was still sleeping. Damn...last night sucked.

They tried to show me how to play Yahzee(sp?) That game is crazy. Anyways, Me and Aaron are officially dating now. It makes me happy. We watched some ""I love the 90's"" last night/this morning. 
 Yesturday, Nicole I. and me went to taco bell and then after work i went back to her house and hung out. We played....imaginary tennis...Pretty simply game, not that hard of a concept to learn, Just stand on oppsite sides of the rooma nd pretend like you know how to play tennis with no racket or ball.... lol We did that for like ah alf hour cause we dumb like that. Walked around her house in prom dresses for the hell of it...lol god, lol I'm so weird. But i love it.

"event","Last night Nicole Inman spent the night cause dad i guess had the feeling we were gonna do somthing weird/or stupid. But Well. we snuck out later and aaron picked us up. and we hung out at his house and shared some drama with nicole and some rumors that have hit the fan about what her bf said. I feel bad for her. But she started feeling better later. It was pretty cool. I talked to dad today about me dating Aaron and he was actually super/surprisling cool about it....like freaky almost. It was crazy. Then he gave me and nicole money for taco bell lol. Mona was being freaky/crazy today...like MEAN. She wouldn't let me and nicole leave when we had to leave...therefore we didn't get to see aaron before he went to work -_-. Which sucks. It's been cool though.

So whatever it is. I don't care. After I posted last night, Aaron called and then he came out to my house and picked me up and we went to his house and just hung out till like 12:30/1:00. Just crashed on his bed and talked. He asked me out, and he said he was sorry for everything pretty much and wants me to give him a chance. I pretty sure I'll do it....more then pretty sure. He wants to go to Kings Island somtime and ride roller coasters(somthing i've developed an un-humanlike phobia agaisnt) lol but I told him I would do it, but i might die. But *shrug* oh well.
  I have tow ork again tommarow, (Tuesday), and Ryan want's to hang out Thursday. But...weird, i made money last week! haha. Its funny...I blew 30 bucks this weekend, and then dad just gave me a 20 to do his laundry andi  havn't even picked up my pay check yet o.O

"event","I dunno how i feel right now. I think I'm depressed...If your wondering why just drive past my house. I'm sure the big ""FOR SALE"" sign in front of my house won't give away any details on why I'm sad. I never really said much about moving to n. caralina. I just basically ignored it and just pretended it would be cool. Then i realized I'm lying to myself. I don't know, Paul obviouslly took if very realistically. more then me i guess. I just figured it would blow over and it was just a think my parents were kicking around. But its serious now, and I hate it...I want to cry everytime i think about leaving. When i first saw the sign i wanted to cry...Its just tonight has been hell. Thats when i first saw the sign. and It just blew me away. I saw Paul and Lisa tonight at the fair, they probably saw me too. I took jarrod cause i was bored. But oh well, just kind of made me feel a bit pathetic. I ran into Travis and Brandon and Brandon was like ""Hey, i heard you and Aaron were talking again...I need to tell you somthing later about what he said "" and then he started telling me and then his girlfriend came up and he ended the conversation before he could tell me....he said it wasn't good. So Fucking figures...funny actually, in an interesting way. He said he would call me later if he got the chance to talk to me baout it. Makes me really nervous, im actually nauseus. -_- I hate myself...I want to be alone-forever.

Gonna be a lonely drive, michael won't be with me so i don't have anyone to talk too. Maybe dad will let me take his truck and he can drive my car cause i wan't a cd player lol. But I dunno i kinda like driving my car. *shrug* I dunno. Its crazy.
    I work by myself thursday so yay me, so i get alot of tips if we are busy. I made 10 dollars in tips last night, and that was the first night i really waited tables by myself. Some customers actually called me by my real name which felt pretty cool, talked to that one guy Earl for like 20 minutes cause he wouldn't end the conversation. heh. It was actually fun last night, that surprised me. 
    I have to burn Aaron a Blink-182 cd and a Smashing Pumpkins, Siamese Dream cd. Which I'll probably do now...or while I'm in the shower, and then if he calls me before he goes to work he can drop by and get them or i can take jarrod and maddy to his house or somthing and give them to him or somthing.*shrug* Blah, i think I'll burn him Oasis just for kicks. I love Oasis....Btw, if somthing even reads my livejournal thanks! lol. You must not have a life either lol.

My parents now focus on me and are startin to actually KNOW who i am and what i am as a person. Its degrading how they just are like just i dunno...how much that really dont know me. I miss michael really bad, he was the one that talked to me and was always there to talk too. This experiance has made me grow up alot. Maybe I'm not ready to grow up so much. But i know i need too.
  I keep forgetting things hardcore now, and i don't know why. Its horrible everyone is noticing it. and its pissing some people off. Cause i keep telling people that i want to go hang out with them and i'll totally forget and in the end i look like a total bitch. I feel horrible about it . Jack thinks the reason im so out of it is because i miss michael so much...T_T i really do miss him.

Parents get back from their vacation tonight....i think. So i guess my party life is killed for awhile.-damn- Aaron wanted to come out and party at my house tonight but my grandma said i should chill out for a day lol. So killed that plan. Doesn't really matter though. I was with Aaron and Nicole I. Most of yesturday. TRYING to find sombody who can get the rim off of my tire. cause its flat. But Autozone seemed a tad bit baffled that what they suggested didnt work hehe. Oh well. 
 I dont really know what i want to do today. Aaron's ignition went out in his car so hes trying to figure out a way to get home from work... I would go get him but im not even sure when i get off work *shrug* He called me last night, we talked for awhile. He said I'v changed a little since last year when we used to talk 24/7. It was either on the phone or the internet or if we were lucky we were hanging out together. Its pretty cool being friends with him again. 
  Ryan Bottorff called me last night and wanted me to come over today. I told him i might stop by before work if I got the chance. He siad i might have to wake him up. but oh well. Ryans a pretty cool friend, we read alot of the same books. I noticed that when i was in his room i was looking at all the books he had and we have alot of the same ones. Like The Inferno, The Odessey, The Works of Edgar Allen Poe..just books like that. 
 Well wow, i posted alot haha. Well maybe i'll get around to making this thing look half-way or maybe a quater or the way decent today....don't get your hopes up though if you read this lol.

I dont know why they do that, cause we are moving there and there gonna freakin live there and they still vacation there...that kinda strikes me as odd.

---I'm actually learning how to play guitar properly, like with notes and chords and stuff instead of just tabs.

Mona had started this weird no wait scratch that, REALY WEIRD thing, she wants to start double-dutching--you know the jum rope thing she said it would ""be fun for the family"" so she gave me her credit card and told me to go get her some jump ropelol... I bought a cd too with that credit card *devilish laugh* (Btw, The Rasmus is a new fetish for me) After that i stopped by casey's house and she burnt me Blink's new cd, then i came home and then went to Ryan louis's house and he basically just left cause he came over. So we just sat around and hung out watched Homestarrunner stuff (www.homestarrunner.com)

"event","Well i havent wrote in this thing since a year ago...but I just wanted to say a year really does make a difference looking back wow..and..all that Brandon drama was so stupid and i cant believe i wasted my time. I guess i learned from it. Now im not saying hes out of my life bc IT NEVER STOPS..but i have a love of my life now his name is Josh hes so wonderful everything I ever wanted. So all that waiting i finally found what i was looking for. I really dont have drama much anymore i quit cheerleading. i can finally say im moving on..in a lot of things and im a better person for it. Im growing up Im going to college next year and i think im the happiest I ever been. Of course ppl have come and gone. But everything is a lesson..and the story of my life keeps going. I never thought i would be in the place i am now..I still have so much to learn. 

I guess growing up isnt too bad even though i cried my eyes out yesterday bc i didnt want to grow up. But looking back it isnt too bad. lol

Peace out"

"event","So yeah...Sorry to all the people who read this and does not have a lj or isnt on my friends list cuz you will not be able to read my journal any longer bc I will be locking it so stupid people who do not need to be in my business can not read it anymore. If you still wanna read it I will fix something up for ya guys lol like Alli and Corinne..sorry guys! EVeryone else who has a lj and is on my friends list all you have to do is log in into ur journal and mine should pop like usual!

haha I just think its funny how people make it their business when they arent anything to me, they know pretty much nothing about me, but yet they want to make it their business what I do? All they wanna do is screw shit up! I love IT! well..Sorry you wont be able to do that anymore!

Its sad when people start to read your lj to get information about you! isnt it?! It really shows they have nothing better to do but mess with my life..which btw you suck at it..cuz you didnt mess ANYTHING UP!

I made this journal so my FRIENDS could read it..no one else. I didnt think anyone would have an interest in it anyways..cuz all I do is bitch half the time and the other half most of you dont know what the hell im talkin about. Unless your someone close to me..but apparently im the center of someones world and they are soooo worried about me so they must read my journal to get information. Wait i shouldnt say worried about me, but what im doing with other people..haha..I find this sooo frickin funny! I thought the crap was over..Guess not?!

They never know when to stop do they!?

Well let me just tell everyone something... nothing..and I Mean NOTHING is gonna screw this time up. So do yourself a favor, grow up, and get over it!

No matter what you do, idc anymore..cuz hes going to be in life like it or not..

Here's to the last post! :-D Now Try being in my life!!!"

My friend isnt mad at me anymore :-D

Everything is okay. 

Ive been watching movies to cure my boredness. Last nite my mom and dad actually let me leave. I picked up Steph and Mary. We were gonna watch movies but blockbusters wasnt open. So we decided to find somewhere to eat and we ended up going to chickfila went back to stephs to eat it. THen Leo finally called and we hang out with him for a lil while. We had bunch of fun! I love them they are awesome. We were so hott we had country music on and up loud all of singing lol. We are dorkous! It was great, I was happy to get out of the house before the hurricane. 

Today I went to blockbuster dropped off two movies and came home watched movies. Lol so basically im being a huge bum!

Last nite I found so many old memories. There was only one thing i regret doing..I regreted so much late nite. I wish I never had done what I did. THen today I realize EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. I have my whole life to live...mistakes are for learning..and life moves on!

I gonna quit being such a drama queen but you know I love it. 
I was so unhappy, but now I look around and its so much crap. I have it all..and I know what I want in life. So Im gonna work to get it. Nothing is going to stop me.

People come and go in my life, but the people that stay make it worth wild. 

I love everyone thats in my life, and Im so grateful! 

Its time to move on...

Ive found it easier if I just leave it alone, it will all come together. Thats what Im going to do.

the end..

be safe everyone love yous!

"event","All day today I was freaking out about the hurricane, not for orlando but for PSL. Tiff lives there, Im so frickin scared for her. I know she will be fine thou. 

Also Him, I want him right next to me. I know what it is. Hes been my security blanket for so long, and now Im so use to him being there. I miss when hes not. Of course he wasnt there for a year and a half..but..thats a different story. Im glad I told him everything last nite. In case something happens at least he knows!

I feel like a 2 year old so hopeless. All day everyone around me has been panicing..I just want to cry thats..all just cry.

When he called last nite, he knew right away that I was crying, I tried to play it off that im just sick, which I am, but I was also crying. He came..he was here in 5 mins. {right when I give up on him, hes pulls through EVERYTIME!}

He cares..but we both need that security that neither of us hold.. thats the problem we both ask questions soo much about each other we are both scared of the hurt. ""Where did you sick from?"" He asks like I was with someone else..""Um..well my dad is sick, so probably him""

Especially me, him im not sure about..hes scared he doesnt want to get into another commitment which DUH..he just got over this huge thing..so of course thats understandable. I think he didnt know my feelings {well he wasnt sure of them} cuz i would play it off like i didnt want a bf cuz i didnt, then after awhile..it was a lie..i couldnt lie anymore. I had to tell him..I had feelings, that it wasnt all fun and games. Keeping it from him HURT soo much! I was scared he would see right through me, which he did, but of course i played it off. Covered well! 

I know all this, I know all possibilities, so naturally im scared to death. I know one of us will get hurt in the end. Like last time, but he was the one left hurt and it was my fault.{and i hated myself for it!} So it would be my turn. 

He knows I care but he doesnt know..what really is going on..no one really does. 

I want to just be friends. I do not want to loose him. I cant loose him. when i lost him for that year and a half..i hated it..i missed him so much. 

But then i want him here, with me more then just a friend.

I dont care what anyone says..if youve done something with someone {kissing} and youve had a past..it brings up feelings..

Last nite I couldnt even frickin say it to his face, but he knew..He asked ""So whats wrong?"" ""Would you rather text me?"" ""Actually dont tell me, just go get the note."" He knew I couldnt/wouldnt tell him. I couldnt even speak. I wasnt crying cuz of him thou, there is so much more..lol {other things going on..} He made me smile thou.

When he called after he left I felt better, it was like he resured me again. 

Somewhere I know Im looking too far into this..

I want to be friends with him I cant loose him, but none of this I can control its totally in his hands...

For once..after all my screwing up..all the messing up I did in the past. This is in his hands. I cant and will not do anything more. He will come to me..he knows the number he knows where i live. Hes know how I feel, but I will not wait.

now for the hurricane Im scared to death for all my friends but im more at ease cuz my mom just came in and said it is dying down! So maybe ill sleep and get over thinking that my friends and family are going to die and that i will die if anything happens to them.."

So either good move or bad move. Idc. im just glad its out it was killing me!!!! Either way i win. either i get to be with him or we are just friends and nothing more. either way ill be happy as a clown!

"event","So today sucks! I dont even want to go there. I got up sick, with a cold, I felt like crap, and I had horrible dreams all nite. 

Got to Britt's house, she felt the same lol {isnt that weird?} we probably got eachother sick. 

Right now, school is boring. I failed my physics test. Woot go me, oh well I really dont care. 

Before Drama, everything started to get better. Josh came up and scared the crap out of me. lol hes a funny kid. He made me smile. Drama was fun..with Jessica, Britt, Sandra, and ANdy! haha random conversations. Cheerleading was fine too. that was my break from everything.

Took Britt, Steph, and Kt bucket home after practice. 

My day has been up and down. UGh Im not in a good mood at all! Everyone is just pissing me off. My sister just walks in the door and just pisses me off. Idk. 

I FREAKIN MISS BRIAN! I WANT BRI BACK. *tears!

Him is frickin annoying me, cuz im really confused and Im sick of it.

One of my friends decides to be pissed off at me..when I was just tellin him he should stick up for him self for once. Instead of takin everyones crap, and he pins it on me saying I called him stupid. When that word never came out of my mouth! So whatever I didnt feel like hearing how horrible I am. So I blocked him, then unblocked him when he got off. I didnt mean for him to take it like that what I said earlier. I didnt think he would take it so literal. WHatever cant deal with it. IM just FRICKIN horrible bestfriend!!!!!!!!!! okay! so yeah make a note to yourself. Brandi isnt a good friend..

Its scary I seem to be gaining and loosing friends. Some friends Im becoming closer too, and others well..you can see..its probably me. I say too much, and Im a bitch at times, but I wouldnt hurt you but I guess Im hurtful with my words. I only saying what I think. Im sick of always being the nice one. I hate how everyone just expects me to take their side. I have my own damn opinon. I guess I just voice it too much. Oh well..

I feel trapped. It seems like everyone wants me dead. Not literally but you know, everyone wants to bring me down. I cant handle anymore. Im frickin sorry! I keep just brushing everything off and not facing it. Usually I will face it, even if its the wrong way to face it. But everything, is too much, I keep turning away.

Church well church..I talked to Leo today Im so happy cuz I miss him like crazy. My mom talked to me last nite about the youth group and I get pissed off every single time. I dont know why, I just do. I dont want to talk about it, I guess. I dont want to start over again. Im just sick oF iT! 

The end..yes im done bitching..

sorry I know lovely entry..

and oh yeah brittany is basically grounded so I cant talk to her and yeah it sickening..bc i feel kinda lost..

and ohhh yeah i triped up the stairs today and i have a lil burn on my hand from it thank god no one was in the wall way! smart one huh?"

"event","Well today was a good day! woot. I was so hyper. Everything is gravy again. Ive been so busy ahh. Today I stayed at school til like 5 then came back at 6. CRAZY!

So Im in T.C.{drama} at school as one of my class. Well there has been many plays and I usually cant try out from them cuz of cheerleading. 

So today was the try outs for the Crucible. I wasnt sure if I was going to try out or not because Ive never done a play before. I never was interested and it always messed with the cheer Schedule. 

Well Sandra, and Jessica said I should and I kinda wanted to. Plus other ppl were very positive and really wanted to me to try out{to my surprise?! lol}. So today I practiced in drama to them and such. After school I try outed for mary warren {I knew I wouldnt get her bc I dont really have the experience, cuz shes kinda a big part in the play, plus there are so many better ppl out there that has been in plays and such, that try outed so I wasnt expected anything} 

Needless to say when I got up there I wasnt nervous like I thought I would be. Thanks to ANDY! and Sandra cuz they went up there with me and read lines. ANDY YOURE FRICKIN AWESOME THANKS SWEETIE AND CONGRATS! I did okay, I could have done better but it was tough comp and I was scared to death.
 
I had cheerleading at 6 so I had to leave after I auditioned and I wouldnt know who go what. So Brittany called me and left a mess on my phone. I got a little part. Im one of the girls. So thats cool I didnt think I was going to get anything. Im happy about it woot. For my first try, I was proud. You all must come to the show :-D. Andy got mr. protector. woot go you! Im so proud. Sandra is one of the girls with me. Im excited this is my first play woot! 

My first varsity cheerleading game was tonite also. It was fun then it got boring after a while. Heather did an awesome basket. So proud of her. I did okay cheering wise, I didnt miss up too bad lol, at the end I kinda gave up and didnt give it my all. I was like okay whatever I wANT to Go HOME! We were all like that thou so yeah.

Today was a pretty good day. Woot Woot. School is gonna be more exciting.

OH yeah Corinne, Jessica and Scott you guys are my heros! lol thanks for coming to the game! lol I loVE it!

2mow Im babysitting at nite I think, and Im hangin with Meg, well Im suppose to be...lol

Still havent heard or seen him since tuesday..hmm...:-D

"event","Okay one more thing..when I saw him again today ...I went insane..I was scared I was gonna have to give him up..if he didnt call me by saturday! ahhh I figured out that..I like him its not past feelings. I Know fickle! Its crazy. Truthfully I dont think I ever stopped caring for him! When he pulled beside me..and was a lil in front. I saw the smoke coming from his window. I was aggravated at him and as soon as I pulled up it was gone. Which was random..but I know he was smoking. He knows I know, so why does it matter?! Whatever..that kinda pissed me off! But hes fixin to be 18. So oh well. Idk. I Know I have feelings for him..and I care for him, but I dont know where I want it to go. aslkdfjaaksdfja SOO CONFUSING!

It was funny when we saw him today cuz everything was reminding me of him again. I saw all these vans that looked like his moms, ahh it wouldnt go away and then..he comes up behind me. Brittany thought I was playing..shes likes yeah laughing, and Im like NO im SERIOUS! and shes turns around and there he was. :-D

AHH IM A DORK!!! AHHHHHHHH...a STUPID DORK!..AHHHHH *sigh* cant help it.

Its like a roller coaster..Its the only thing keeping me sane..well besides my bffs! Cough BRITTANy & TIFFANy Cough 

Now Im wondering..what I should do now..I know nothing. He called thats good..so lets see if he calls again..he hates the phone. ANd he never like talks talks on the phone. So im really surprised he called Sunday after he left..{usually he will call a day or 2 later} then 2day 3 freakin times?! and leaves a message..HA..idk?!

So like the stalkers we are we follow him then loose him so we turn around cuz now we are on aloma and we passed my house. Then all a sudden I see Brandon! LOl it was so funny he speeds past this car to catch up then he got in front..and switches lanes. At the red light we talked for a lil bit..then we were off again i was in the lead..:-D but i had to turn off at my street..so yeah it was so much fun. It was sooo random thou..wow good day..Everything else sucks in my life. Pam left the church, I dont even wanna think about it. Im so over everything else. Today had its good and bad points!

"event","Well I woke up this morning all in the best mood ever. LAst nite SUCked majorly cuz I wasnt aloud to go anywhere, and I was upset bc i found something out that I didnt want to know persay and it just sucked. I through a fit and I was over it. 

So this morning Brittany calls and wants to go to lunch, so she can get out of her house. So we went on a lil date. We went to chilies. We got sat in the corner and everything. It was so cute we ate lunch then we went across the street to steak n shake got milk shakes. Yum yum. In the drive thru we were dancing crazy and stuff it was so funny. I had a blast needless to say. I love going on dates espeically with someone I love with all my heart. Tehe. What could get better then that? After lunch and such I took her home.

My mom n Sis got home and we got ready to go to kayleys b-day party. I stayed for an hour and went to pick meg up from work. I thought she worked at the Oviedo Walgreens um..no I was already on red bug. Stupid me went to the Oviedo Walgreens, when she works at the one on red bug. My blond moment for the day. It was funny thou. Man was it pooring outside. which sucked bc we didnt get to do anything we wanted to do, which is normal I guess for us. Lol..But soo ANnoying! 

We left her work went got my hair cut, went back to her house so she could get changed. Didnt know what to do cuz our plans got ruined. So we decided to go out to waterford and paint the tile we started a while back. After that we headed to DQ.. but of course it wasnt open. I pretty much made a cirlce and went to the ice cream place down by her house. OMGOSH it took forever. I was getting really bitchy cuz I had to pee and so did she! ahhh we were both dying. We got back to her house ran to the bathroom lol..{im sure you guys wanted to know that} and watched Shes all that. It was great fun but kinda depressing at the same time cuz we didnt get to do what we planned *tears*. maybe next time Meg?! hehe

So thats been my day, I had a blast...it wasnt bad I must admit. tehe Spending the day with 2 of my best friends..:-D
*********************************************************************

Okay Im sorry If I was a bitch to you today, espeically if you were a guy, cuz I dunno just got annoyed at some points of the day. 

Ahh he was in my head a lil today when I was thinking. lol Brittany a couple of times was like Brandi are you okay? lol I totally spaced out while I was driving and its like every song that is played reminds me of him or the other one. Its just so annoying. I missed them both, and yet they both screwed me over, and I still care. GOD STUPIDNESS!

My churh is gone from the hurricane and we are meeting 2mow or whatever. I dont even wanna go. It seems like everything that our church had is gone now. and has been for a while. So many people moved on, and it just not fun anymore. My youth is fallin apart I feel like. Its really really sad..All the great times, all my church family is like disappearing...So many memories so many things we went through. I really miss them. Thats why i havent been active bc idk it seems like we are fallin apart and i couldnt take it. Whatever cant deal with it...They all know I love them no matter what!

Ahh its really getting to me now. They are both getting to me.

I missed him so much, He was there for me when things got tough. He always listened to me bitch. Always there to help when I asked. I miss him so much I really do, maybe it was a mistake saying goodbye makin him block all my screen names. I still have to see him and it hurts every damn time, thats why I get so nervous. Cuz, Im scared I might back down again. Like im doing now..

GOSh I miss you, you know exactly who you are. If you are reading this..I miss you, I wish I still had those times. I never got around to say that you were really something great in my life. I wont forget you..thats one thing I can promise you. lol Mr. never promise anything!

Whatever you probably dont care, you probably havent even thought of me. lol..maybe you have. I still think of you, all those stupid times, rough times, good times, you were the only one who could really make me laugh. Yeah I guess it was nothing thou, I never saw you, it was stupid. But Chels b-day party, that was the best time I had with you in forever. Youve always been full of surprises.  

Now the other one lol..well..Im upset with him very much and he'll never know, I wont be able to talk to him about it. But he'll notice the change. I dont want to be his girl anymore. I dont wanna be used. I cant deal with the thinking. If hes okay all the time or the jealously. Its for the best. Ill leave those feelings in the past where they belong. He wont hurt me anymore.

Its hard giving up the things that you really love the most...but sometimes its for the best.

I love you guys.."

"event","I didnt know I was hurting this much. Til I realized thats all I talked about last nite. All Ive been talkin about, since hes left this house. I know the truth, I know the answers, I know its wrong. But it hurts like hell, I didnt want him to go. I watched him zoom off in his car, I knew right then and there. It was goodbye. Everything I got back was taken all away in one day.

It was my turn to be hurt by him. I trusted him thou, weve been through a lot together. Weve known eachother forever we always had that flirting friendship even when we werent going out. Being friends isnt gonna work, it would be too hard. So I must give him up!

Now it just hurts, I know the truth. Everyone sees it and so do I! I want it my way, and have him actually care, but I know exactly what I am to him. 

How do I talk to him how do I say no? Its too hard. Its something I have to do. I dont wanna fight with him anymore. 

Hes gonna hurt me, more then anything in the world. Im not going to let him, I cant. So I must give him up now, before its too late.

I know what he wants and knew it all along. There are no second chances. Its not worth the pain.

My paranoia..gets me ever since he left. What is he doing? I hope hes okay! I never cared before. He always came and left, but this time it was different I didnt want to see him leave. And I actually worried.

To be able to kiss someone like that, hold someone like you care, how could you? How do u live with yourself?

I know hes been hurt, but he shouldnt hurt me too.

But all is fair, since i hurt him first.

I missed him, he was taken away, I didnt know what I had. Til it was too late. 

So now Im here wipping my tears away...I just wanted to say...

Ill miss you once again, you meant the world, but not today and not ever will you play me for a fool.

I caught you in your game, and you have no clue I know. As soon as you call baby...ill be sure to let you know.

I love the little things..

I love when he kisses you on ur forehead, or hand bc it just shows how much he really cares.

I love when he places his hand on ur face and kisses you so passionately when you are just so mad at him.

I love that...

but the question is, does he still love you, after all this time. After all the heartaches and fights. 

Yeah feelings are always there, and there is no turning back now, friendship is too hard to put as a last resort. 

So what is it, that you really want?

Im not the girlfriend, Im not friends with benfits, Im not your hoe..you say Im your girl? Please get out of here with that..I know exactly...

He says Im just a tease. When he knows Im just this way with him, because of the fact, that I know the concept of my actions can lead to consequences, But he always comes back, why?

How can someone kiss you like that, hold you like this, and not care, and not have feelings?

or does he really have feelings but cant find them with all the confusion........

or is he just using you..like most do?

or is he scared of another heartache

You know exactly what he wants, and he knows there is no way, hes going to get it. So why come back?!...

Would I break your heart once again or will you break mine instead?

"event","Today was just all over the place. I got up and mom and Britt were leaving. Then my grandma wanted to go to the mall to pay a bill and she wanted me to go with her. So we did that. I came home and Dev called and wanted to do something. Since I owed him a movie for not going last weekend cuz of stupid charlie. Him and I decided to go to a movie. We saw I, Robot. It was very good! I had an awesome time. We always have a good time thou, we are just dorkous! haha Tonite Brandon is coming over he called on the way home, I picked up Britt woohoo.
 
********************************************************************
 
Okay So Im Stupid! Today is Wednesday, people work on Wednesdays. People who I wasnt sure if I wanted to see work on Wednesdays at the mall. On the way to Devs house I thought about how people would be at work. It didn't really bother me. Even when we got there it didn't bother me, until I had time to actually think about it. After I saw him, My heart started beating fast, for some reason I was stressing over the fact that he was there.

Then we walked over there and I really started to freak out. I just couldn't do it. Seeing him made me soo frickin nervous. When I get nervous, my tummy starts hurting, or I start to shake. So I left to the bathroom to call Brittany so it wasnt obvious. AHhhh...
 
You thought the worse was over oh no! lol I waited in line with Dev, and then we sat down right in front of the place. {by that point i didnt care again, I was okay.} Then I looked up and he came from behind the counter to do samples. I looked straight at him and he looked at me. I didnt know what to do..heart dropped..al;sdkfja..whatever..Devin kept my attention thou, so it was all good. 

Didnt think it would bother me this much, to not say hey, to not smile, to act like I didnt wanna talk to him. WHATEVEr..Cant think about it..block it out..that always helps *COUGH*

Im not sure why he made me so nervous today, he didnt do a thing, I didnt care, but I just cant face him...Its frickin cRazY. I never do this..with other people...Just him, its happened once before..After all this time he still makes me nervous. And I Absolutely HATE it! I wanna it to DIE!!! LOl I do not want to care for once..why should I CARE?!
********************************************************************

I think Im going stupid today cuz man..yeah I did some dumb things today!

So Brandon and Brittany were over...interesting...I dont know. I dont even wanna go there! Lets not talk about it..ConfUSiON! My ears hurt from all the bull shit talk..

That was my day...

No School Monday and Tuesday WOOT!!! Im happy about that cuz i have homework that i havent done. But it sucks cuz we have to make it up. AHHHHHH..

Whatever.. nothing new.. I didnt get to go to the movies with Devin today. OMgosh the traffic is horrible. Brittany is over now so im gonna go hang out with her tonite. I missed her too much.

"event","Yeah Crazyness!!...Well We have been very lucky actually! I have electricity woot! I didnt know it hit that bad til today when i was riding around. Im just happy that most everyone that I know of is okay and safe! Our church is totally messed up, we will have to get a new church. Really sad! Its been a sad and boring day! Im going crazy in this house. All of the family came over cuz we were the only ones that had power. Its crazyness. I wonder if we are gonna have school Monday! Everyone was out cleaning up today! Most ppl still dont have electricity..So idk? I hope everyone is okay! 

It was really busy today, since everyone was at my house yeah kinda crazy but yeah. I miss Brittany I saw her once today, Beth called I wonder if her party still went on? Who knows..but there was no way we were gonna go over there with all this crap going on. Devin and Meg have kept in touch so i know Oviedo is living lol! LHHS is fine lol other schools i heard got really screwed up. Trinity prep is soo messed up and its like a mile away from our house. We are so lucky! God was really looking over us! so much so much. Hopefully 2mow everything will settle.

2mow Im suppose to be going to my Cuz's b-day who knows whats going on I really wanna get out and see if everyone is okay and such, but everything is up in the air. I was also suppose to be going to the movies with Devin. I really wanna go see Bri and Steven cuz I havent heard from them but mom wont let me drive. I know Bri is fine cuz I talked to his step mom. Steven Idk thou. Im sure they are all fine. 

I was feeling really guilty Friday night thou, Everything was goin through my head. Cuz I was talkin like it wasnt gonna hit and such and it did. I felt bad too cuz I said some really mean things to someone..I meant them of course but it was wrong timing. I would probably go insane if something happened to him{cuz i still do love him to death AS A FRIEND but what can you do?!?}, but im pretty sure hes fine. 

It really bugs me thou, I dont know where he was coming from, I guess when he said im always pissed, he was talkin about when I messing with him earlier in the week sayin oh since you never have time for me and blah blah. I WAS JK! BTW! I was busy myself. I was just giving you a hard time. Whatever it doesnt matter anymore, there is nothing I can do. Ive tried to keep us from fallin...and you know what oh well..there is nothing I can do anymore. He knows{well better know} I love him, and I want him to be in my life {other wise he would already be out!} but Im not gonna be treated like this all the time. I can not take it anymore, he has a different understanding of friendship then me, I guess maybe thats it. But to me friendship isnt like that. If he wants me in his life he will have to come to me cuz Im always the one talkin to him, always seein how he is doing {he knows I care cuz hes dum if he doesnt, and for a while we were really close, he was awesome and is awesome but it went down hill} if I didnt talk sometimes i bet we wouldnt even freakin talk. Friendship is a freakin effort..takes two ppl! ANy way ill shut up about cuz it doesnt matter anymore. I said what I had to say, and its up to him. {and let me tell ya u can keep ur pride, be stubborn, but dont think Im gonna come back and say sorry, or talk to you, or try any longer, cuz I tried..I cant do it anymore..its too much} and you better not be like omgosh she doesnt want me in her life I hurt her too much blah blah please shut up cuz you know I want you here in my life, but not like this, I do not wanna fight I dont want to get in stupid arguments over miscommuications anymore. Im just sick of it. You were one of my bffs, I love you a lot, I look up to you a lot, I miss you as well, but i understand things change, people move on get new friends, other things happen, and come along, and thats fine.This is all you now buddy but Im not gonna sit around, you might never talk to me, u might talk to me a month from now, but dont expect me to be there cuz its not fair.. yeah life isnt fair, but this is one of the things i have a say in. 

I hope everyone is okay, and safe. My thoughts and prayers are
to the people in port Charlotte!

I love you guys!

...bouncing... 

Try to keep in touch..my cell phone isnt working but call the house..or leave a mess here or email me, Ill be checkin!...Love you!"

"event","Did it again..

He slipped away so easily. It was never gonna be the same now was it? The little hope I did have, Crashed and burned! So I just stopped. I stopped it all, but I had to say something to see if he was alive still, to know he still existed, to know that I didnt imagine it. That the past some odd years were not a waste. He's still there, still doesnt care. So far away he is now, what can I do? Not a thing nor do I want to. Whats the effort, if he has none? I was abandoned by him and there was no fight, nothing happened. Just went away. Im scared to talk to him, Im scared to see him again but I force myself because of that hope, that friendship was so unbreakable. Everyone knows it was going to end some friendships end thats just the way it goes. Everything breaks but sometimes there are too many pieces to put it back together again.

Im nothing to him once again, I never was, just a shoulder to cry for a while til he got bored with me. Drama Queenish, Yes of course, not a big deal who cares right?! Too bad I do, I shouldnt, of course, but I really do!

I miss him of course, but I know that everything will be just fine without that friendship. Actually Ive been kinda of proud of myself because I dont think about it that much anymore, I moved on. But on days like this..it happens again..just one word could trigger it all.

Just slipped away again..

Im sorry to say...

My friendship, respect, and hope will never fade...Just you...

I love you forever, Ill miss you for too long but one day...

Youll just be that guy that slipped away.."

She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Stand up for yourself

walk around with your hands up in the air like you dont care

Im ungrounded 2mow woohoo! Ugh my computer is broken but we are gonna get it fixed cuz I cant deal with having this computer in the living room ahh its soo annoying! People everywhere telling me to get off every 5 secs!! ahh I dont like it. But I love the computer!

Yes thats how I feel right now!!! haha Its a number of things that are just on my nerves my mom shes just annoying me today, she didnt do anything im just really bitchy and tired! She has to ask me like a million freakin questions! ugh so annoying!

I had practice today it was fun I love having cheer class! woohoo..Eh today was good Im so bored thou, lol! Busy listening..yeah I know I listen its amazing! Working for straight A's this year..wonder if I can do it...COUGH!!

Brain isnt working today, Ive been like uh duhhh all day! I know im always like that but today i just couldnt keep it together...I think I have a lot on my mind that Im pushing off! lol

Something is really annoying me about *stupidhead!*
I dont even wanna talk to him but its habbit now..so idk im breakin that habbit. Im always the friend he only talks to when no one else is better around! Its so annoying and then I have to hear him bitch..which is great idc thats cool cuz i do it alot too but half the time..i have to ask a million and one questions to see hows he doing. and i truthfully just dont care anymore! He doesnt care for me why should i give a crap about him? I know you are all thinking well duh Brandi why are you even friends with him if he doesnt care as a friend? good question cuz im STUPID!... And i know once i stop caring..then there is no point, I know hes there its really hard to push him out. He everywhere now I see him alot more then before and im involved with his school things alot too..so i know ill have to see him. I want to talk to him about it but i end up telling him something else like about my ex bfs{random i know, i just pull crap out of my butt...cuz i chicken out!} cuz i dont know how to talk to him about it and i know he wouldnt care{hes kinda told me before when we were fighting..so what the heck and im doing then right why should i be friends with someone that is a jerk all the time?!} I dont want him to be apart of my life. he basically isnt already so he should just go away bc he just makes me sad and annoyed! 

My english teacher said today we were talkin about something and he said its really annoying to know that you are nothing to one person even if you have a lot of friends or people who care about you bc that one person makes you feel like youre nothing at all..

haha I know im being all dramatic about it and all omgosh and acting like no one cares...lol hell i know i have GOOOD friends that CARE sooo Much and I love them soo much tooo! hehe! But for me its really annoying to know that one person doesnt care that im around in his life when i once was a big part of his life! It just annoys the crap out of me bc i didnt do a thing!!! Friends dirft apart and such I understand, and I know its just me, im not apart of his life anymore really, so why should he care, but see i think differently. I still do care bc BEST FRIENDS never stop loving eachother no matter what. thats what at true best friend is they never really drift apart! It bugs me bc I sometimes feel like he was just a waste of my space! and thats so mean but I cant help it. I wouldnt take anything back of course. But he needs to get out of his ass and wake up. Bc no matter what Ive always been there for him! Through all his gfs..i was there when he was heartbroken when he was sad when he wanted to bitch when he was happy! Everything I was there. I would call him to just say stupid stuff. I cared.. and never once it seemed like he did.

"event","Hmm..another day at school. It was cool everything is going smoothly for now that is. I like all my classes even physics isnt too bad, I think he was just having an off day yesterday! 1st day of practice woohoo it was fun. I like having cheerleading as a class now, its so much easier then having to stay after school for 2 more hours. Now i get out earlier! woohoo! Im happy about everything thats is happening. Im really excited for this year for the 1000th time haha! oh yeah and Jessica got her schedule changed and shes in my 3rd period WOOHOO!!! Everyone else seems like they dont exist its really odd! This year its all mixed around which isnt bad but I kinda miss Beth and other ppl! 

Im been thinking a lot lately...people whom I thought were important really arent is something I realized. Also I was looking back at the past because one of my ex's is in two of my classes and Him and I dont talk just cuz its odd..but we are still nice to each other but yeah its just weird. I realized how much everything does change and for the good...not always bad. I look back and kinda laugh bc things that were such a big deal back then arent anymore. They dont even matter. Another thing I realized was the person {him} that I thought was the most important, really isnt at all. 
It doesnt really matter if hes in my life anymore, I mean dont get me wrong I want him to be, I love him to death and I love still being friends with him. I wouldnt wanna ever loose him but I know for a fact that it probably doesnt matter to him that we talk or that Im even in his life. Maybe it does? Idk but its not that big of a deal anymore. He was a life lesson and sometimes you have to let go to see what else lays ahead. I also thought I would be loosing something huge if I lost him, but truthfully it would hurt but life goes on. I guess what Im saying is I always thought persay I couldnt live without him, but the truth is I could and would be just as happy. 
I looked at my ex today and we are totally different people now. I use to regret liking him or going out with him bc he hurt me and things happened between us. But now i look back and im glad it happened, and I learned from it and i learned to let go of him, just like I am with Him. 
Its funny cuz he has no clue, seriously he doesnt really care either well actually he does but thats the thing he never cared enough to show it. Sometimes I wonder if he would notice if i stopped being the person who always listens the person he talks to when no one else is around. I dont want to be that anymore. Sometimes I just want to say goodbye, and then sometimes I dont. 

Well thats good for now...I have to go to church.. woohoo!

*ps I have no clue where all that came from...."

A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty, he said...no.  She asked him if he would want to be with her forever....and he said no. She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry? and once  again he replied with a no.   She had heard enough . As she walked away, tears streaming down her  face the boy grabbed her arm and said....You're not pretty you're beautiful. I  dont want to be with you forever. I NEED to be with you forever, and i wouldnt  cry if you walked away...i'd die...

************************************************

On my trip to the grand canyon I had so much time to think and guess who came to mind. Everytime I leave he always gets placed into my head, and its soo annoyin. I didnt realize how many things were unanswered and how much I wanted to say to him all thou times and never did. How much I wish I could leave it alone. Not remove it from my brain bc i dont regret it at all..in fact im glad it happend, all of it. All the crap we went through Im glad we did. But I still wish I had some answers. Then I remember how horrible he was at times, and i still cared. 

Thats not all i thought about, I thought about all of you!!! haha all my friend especially Brittany, Meg, Tiffany, Bri and Steven. I missed them too much, I say! too much! haha they really are soo special to me and im glad they are all in my life. They always make me feel like im special.

"event","so ive lost myself again
once again
see this is my problem, here.. i will outline it for you:
i am too nice, i am too gullible.. i believe in the common good way too much
i get used
abused
TRAMPLED on
and thats the thing... everytime.. every fuckin time.. i dont even see it coming
im blindsided
sideswiped
the thing is that its not that im throwing myself out there
im not wearing my heart on my sleeve
but these guys.. these guys i get involved with
they seem to find a way to dig themselves into my head
bury themselves into my thoughts
they start off innocently,
then continue to feed my heart with random love songs
and its not even that im in love
its not even that im in complete like
its the factuation part
they make me feel like i am the only girl.. ONLY GIRL on this earth
they make it seem like i am the hottest, smartest, coolest, most original
thats how they get me..
they rub it in my face that they are smooth.. without straight up saying ""im smooth, watch out for me because ill rip your heart out""

honestly, i dont get heart broken from the guy... i get my heart broken just a little from the fact that once again i chose the wrong guy to waste my time with, i get heart broken a little that once again its not going to work out for me.. 
that once again i dont get to feel love
that once again i have to explain to my parents why it didnt work out
that once again IM the idiot who thought that this cool guy would settle down with me
i mean..
thats what they insinuate right?
thats the ideas they put in your head? right? right?

im sorry if im sounded naggy.. i am.. I HAVE THE RIGHT TO? right? this is my blog haha.. but the thing is.. i pry myself on not being naggy.. im about to burst!!!!!!
DONT USE ME
DONT PUT FALSE HOPE IN MY HEAD
just be yourself, tell the truth.. play it as it is..
cuz i would MUCH RATHER hear that you only want to fool around with me.. then to listen for a month and a bit how much you miss me, or how much fun you have with me, or how good we are together.. or anything that would make me POSSIBLY think you want to be with me

people.. just be real.. otherwise.. im gonna lose myself.. i hate being surrounded by fakeness.. god."

reflection.
confession.
obsession.
its that time of the day again.
dark.
lonely.
quite.
its that time in my mind again.
you.
me.
us.
i cant help it.
not one bit.
it just comes to me.
you just come to me.
in my dreams.
my thoughts.
my fucking mind.
when i turn a corner its you i see.
when i see a shadow its you i see.
i cant avoid you.
i cant deny you.
i cant even fucking hide from you.
you arent here.
who am i kidding.
and yet you are.
in every way that isnt possible.
you are the life in the sweater.
you are the movement in the wind.
you are the hope in my mind.
fucking hope.
theres no hope.
and yet, i still believe.
in you.
in your sweater.
in my dreams.
in my ability to never overcome this.
this thing will always be with me.
you will always be with me.
because i cant give up.
it wont give up.

i cant.
sleep tight tonight."

so this is my most recent stuff I guess:

- to know that in a couple of house I have to seem happy is almost too unbearable

- know that when youre looking at the moon, im looking at that same moon

- ""i wish I knew how to quit you""

- ""let the stars stand as witness to them all""

- youre the one i want and its not just a phase

- youre there when i close my eyes

- im empty without the hope in your sweater

- whats to blame for tomorrow, heaven's claimed all your sorrow


So thats some of them.. the "" ""  ones are lyrics from songs... but yea, its been 2 years and yet i still think about him.. I mean.. all the little things in my memory have faded.. but the overall picture is still playing over and over in my head. I cant get him out and its killing me."

i called you.

i thought maybe you were walking to my house.
so i waited by the window.
the sound of the dashboard cd in the back.
the last couple of songs... i cried.
i still waited.
silence.
and you werent here yet.
when the cd ended.
so did my soul.
you didnt show up at all that night.
no phone call.
no email.
no love.
no heart.


you wouldnt know what im talking about becuz you probably didnt notice.
but i did.
and every time i listen to the dashboard cd.
i cry.
i cant help but feel the pain i felt that night."

And expecting something to come to me.

"event","When you wear make up its like a mask, no one sees the real you, no one knows what the real you looks like, until you uncover yourself.
What about the days you want to dress up, look alittle nicer, no one will care becuz theyll be used to the mask. weird, cuz what you really wanted to be was noticed, but all youre doing is blending in with the society.

Do you feel more comfortable in your real skin or your fake skin? make up doesnt cover your insecurities, youll have to face them eventually."

These hearts they race from self-control
Were doing fine, were doing nothing at all.

so much for all the promises you made
so much for your endearing sense of charm
its been wasted on me.

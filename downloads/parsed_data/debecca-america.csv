on top of all this i tried to color my hair this weekend with a box which turned into a whole 3 hour fiasco fix at the hair salon the next day.  they did a good job, but i still have to get used to it."

"event","I wnet to the basillica block and had a blast this weekend.  We of course got really drunk both night and hit a couple bars off of first avenue,  on Friday night we watched midnight oil and soul aslyum and they both rocked. then we meet up with some of deb's friends and went to brither's and the refuge. we nad fun then we met some guys and made out.  on saturday we went to her friend's katie's house before the shows had somem cocktails then went to the show.  we ran into so many people there that we only caught part of sister hazel.  Deb casued major drama when she slapped her ex-boyfriend.  but it's all okay now she got schmoed. :).  Wer then went to some bars again.  we went to the district which totally turned out to be a high school reunion for us and so many of the high school hottied we just that, high school hotties.  they look so bad now and unfortunatly drunk me said some things to one of them i had a crush on then that i shouldn't have said, nut at least i can blame it on being drunk.  then we hailed a cab headed back and ended up home at 4:30 in the moring.
brandt turns 21 on tuesday the 16th and we wanted to show himt the bars of minneapolis but instead we a sitting at and applebee's because ""none of the guys can/want to go to minneapolis"" but we will see how this turns out.  it's probably gonna bust becasue applebee's won't serve papers only reds whcih he doesn't have.  sometimes i wonder why i put any efforts forth.  well i a hope you are all having fun and happy birthday my dear jail bait!!!!"

"event","it's been a long time since i have written to let you all know how i am doing and not much had changed. i am still working and all that jazz but much has changd for my friends.  my poor debie had lost her man due to some stupid thinking and there isn't much that any of us can do.  there isn't mcuh news on the man front... still single but with some interests  ( luke and dave).  I am done with brandt now until he makes some changes.  i know i have said it before, but there is only so much that i can do.  i am tires of beung disrespected and pushed aside.  i deserve something... so i guess you could say that i have lost my best friend.  I hope that everyone else is okay though, nothing but the best for us all. work sucks though. this girl that i thought was my friend turns out be nothing but someone for the moment.  she has said some stuff that she doesn't know that i heard and she doesn't really have mcuh respect for anyone including herself.  I gues what i really need right now is a big does of happiness.  i have been kinda depressed lately and  i just need more reasons to smile.  oh well i fuess life goes on.  have a good night everyone.

"event","so i woke up this morningand got ready for work. i then went on the hunt for harry potter on dvd. after buying that i thought that i would spend some time at ridgedale . bad idea. i spent quite a bit a jcpenney on shirts for work, and a whole lot more a lane bryant (i bought pj's and jewelery).  then i went and worked my ass of at proex.  all in all it was an okay day.
so we have all decided that brandt is a little bitch. he told me and my friend deb at different times that he told his woman that he was going to spend a lot more time with his friends this summer.  has that happened since he came home? nope and to top it all off his girlfriend doesn't like me and this has been confirmed  yeah me.  it really sucks, but what are you going to do about a boy who gets easily whipped?
another little complaint for one individual is why haven't you call me since you got back from san francisco? am i not good enough for you?  i feel so hurt and unloved.  besides i am still waiting for the cake you promised last time you hurt me... tear."

"event","life has been pretty boring lately nothing much to talk about though.  erin (this girl that i truly dislike) was in town a little bit ago, but luckily i didn't have to se her that much. we all went to the acme comedy club on monday and it was fun.  it turned out taht some other people we knew we sitting right in front of us.  i went to movie trivia night as well which is always fun.  andy was totally trying to get with stacy but she wouldn't have it.  everyone is now convinced that brady likes me.... we don't know what to do about this though... any suggestions?  
brandt and i finally made up which made me very happy because i hate being mad at him and i got to tell him that there is proof that his girlfreind doesn't like me. on saturday she had told sarah and i quote "" i don't like becca. it's okay if i don't have to talk to her.""  and i told him this because i thought that he should know. he said that he was going to talk to her about it and that he wasn't going to get anyone in trouble or make matters worse. so not even a half hour later he has her on the phone talking to her about this. i atleast thought he would do it on person.  so anyway he can't remeber anything of what he or she said... and then i had to work with her for 2 hours.  :( not good. oh well what's a girl to do.
my sister and the baby are doing fine. i hope to get a picture of him on here soon so everyone can see.
i went bowling last night withe my friend jamie and his fiancee mandy and then his friend paul and some other guy named brian.  first game i bowled a 74 losing to everyone and then th second game i beat evryone with a 131... still doesn't beat brian's score of 158 from the first game.  and some kid a couple lanes ove bowled a perfect 300.  it was insane.  well now that you all know how boringmy life is i am going to run away and hide."

I was sitting at the table with mika and jeff next to me and my shoulder was hurting so i was streaching it.  jeff looked and me and asked me waht was wrong and i just said my shoulder hurt.  he then asked me what i did to it and i didn't do anything that i knew of.  mika looks at me and he says do you want me to break it for you and replied asking him if i could pull out all his leg hairs one by one.  jeff then looked at mika and goes that't how you pick up chicks... hi my name is mika, can i break your shoulder? and it was soo funny that my mouthful of beer was sprayed all over everyone... especially hot dave who was sitting right across from me.  i wanted to crawl under the table and hide the rest of the night.

there was one nice thing today.  as funny as it sounds Brandt is rip-roaringly drunk up at SCSU (st cloud state for those who don't know) and he called and left two hilarious messages for me.  it is always funny when i get drunk calls from him.  as i type he is at a better then ezra and wookie foot concert.  at least that's what i could understand through his drunkenness and all his sister's screaming.  hopefully the rest of my day will look up.  now to eat my nummy burritos."

we watched the vancouver detroit game and of course detroit won, then we watched slap shots 2.... are we sensing a theme yet?
he says that he's going to come with to movie trivia on wednesday but we will see about that, besides it might make things awkward with the movie trivia guys, but let's hope not."

"event","I can't sleep at all...i've tried...everytime i think i'm ready i start to think again and then i start coughing and my throat gets all swollan and i need to blow my nose again. Then when i go back to sleeping i start to think again and it isn't like good thoughts...well some are, but then some aren't. I just start to think ""what if i died?"" I'm not saying i want to but that just poped in my head...like a what if...I tried to think of something else but its kinda hard to block that thought out....its like weird to say...but i tell you everything so i'm telling you. I get really scared and i feel alone...you have no idea how much i hate being away from you when i know you are like right there. I miss you alot and i know what you mean about when you said you wanted to cry when you saw me that one day..At first i wasn't sure if it was you so i looked again and i smiled at you, and i saw you somewhat smile at me...that made me happy and my heart started to race, but it made me sad, to know that i couldn't talk to you...or just hold your hand, just to be around you. Thats why i wanted to see you the next day and when i was walking to class i saw you in ms.h's room soo i thought i would wait for you. Something told me i needed to,and i had to tell you what i thought about everything, and what i would like to see happen. I could tell that you were tired and out of it...but you still smiled at me and that made it worth it to me. You know i can't stay mad at you. It did make me feel better to hear your voice today, i miss being around you, and you taking me to class or just telling me you love me, i'm sorry if i'm being forward or pushy or anything, i don't mean to be i'm just telling you what i've been thinking. and i'm sorry if none of this makes sence since i'm a little out of it right now. You know how you are always saying you don't think your good enough for me, or you just don't know about me anymore? you know that thought has crossed my mind too, in why you think that, and why i say you are wrong when it comes to that. If i thought you weren't good enough for me do you think i could still be around? Do you think i would make you such a big promise. The promise that i've made to you already and i'm going to keep. My heart would have told me to take off, but it told me to wait, wait for you to miss me like i do you, wait for you to understand everything a little more clearly. Let it all come to you. In which i do plan on understand, I love the ways you look at me, no one looks at me like you do, i've seen people look at me with the idea of ""oh i would like to be with her"" and no i don't like the way the look at me, it isn't no where near as when you look at me, because its special and if i wasn't so attached to you it wouldn't be so hard, but thats how i know i love you cause its hard for me to attach to anyone, or trust anyone. but this brake doesn't mean i want to stop talking to you, or telling you everything i think or what i do in a day or how i feel about you, i don't want that feeling to be lost and i think that is what i'm afraid of right now. What if you start to think this is a wast, and i'm not worth it anymore because we don't talk like we use to anymore, or we don't do a lot of stuff like we use to, so i'm just going to end it here...thats what i'm scared of. but why? Why should i be right?, you know when you first ask me out it was like once a week i got to see you, or if i did get to see you everyday it was for like 5 mins, remember? And that made me the happiest girl in the world, but you would write in here and i would have something to look forward to, or something that made me just smile even if it was an ""i love you"". I understand you are busy now and i am proud of you. I really am, i don't demand time all the time, and if it comes out that way, i'm sorry. I want you to try and understand something and see it my way,I don't need all the attention as you think i need all the time, i wouldn't want it all at once, you know how i get when you do to me...i blush and just smile and i can't wait to tell someone what you said to me. To me I've always thought we were one of the lucky couples seeing as we still live in the same state and we get to see eachother and talk, some people aren't as lucky as us, you know what i'm saying? I don't want you to think or try to think that you are getting in my way, or me getting in your because i'm not or trying to be or stop you from doing anything. I'm sorry that this is long and things just run into one after another. I just wanted to tell you all this i guess there is more but i will tell you another day, or when we talk again on the phone or in person...I think this about did it and i'm about to fall asleep right now...lol..I hope you have a wonderful week babe and everything you hope to do gets done. 
I love you

"event","I haven't even looked in here in forever, but something told me to, so i did. I looked at everything and i remembered every feeling it all came back, i smiled like you wouldn't believe, i blushed like you still make me do. So why is it that we are like what we are now? I don't want this feeling to go away, the feeling that your heart is flying and nothing seems to matter as much as this, but i do understand that in life there comes sacrifices and at one point or another people have to make them. I'm not scared of it and i understand it but i don't want to let go of you.I know i have things i have to work on because i did let my attitude get in my way and the ways i think get in the way, and yes a lot of it has to do with stress. I don't want this between me and you to end just because we have been fighting and it's all over stupid shit if you stop and really think about it. And i'm truly sorry that i made it into a bigger issue than it was, and i know now because i have had time to stop and think about this all and see now and i know thats how the fights normaly start. I do know that you are the one that is for me if you think so or not, because why would i still feel this way for you? if i didn't why would i still be around? I do love you even if you don't know about me anymore. I guess i will end it here."

Baby you know you mean everything to me and without you i don't know what i would do, i would most likely be my sad and depresed little self, putting on a smile for everyone to see, because thats what casey is all about, but i never really was until you found me. From the first time you held my hand i felt something and the first time you kissed me i felt something and i still do. You are the only person i wait for, from when you get to school, or get online,I sit and wait for you. I love you soooo much baby, I love everything about you babe, from the faces you make at me, the way you hold me hand, the way you talk to me, the way you hold me that feeling that you don't want to let go and i don't want to let go of you <3, the way you kiss me i smile always even when i say i don't i do. You are my everything and my one and only. You are my bestfriend and i love being with you and telling you everything, even if i did something stupid, i will tell you because i won't lie to you. Anything you ask i will answer and i won' lie, i can't lie to you because i would be drowned in guilt and i hate that feeling. So i will never do that to you. Baby i hope you know all this, but i'm telling you again because you are just that special to me <3. I will end it here for now baby

There he is

When I feel like crap or don't want to talk there he is
When I don't want to smile or try to make myself feel better there he is
There is no end to heart,or his kindness
he thinks diffrent but I don't

I see him as a gentle person,smart,and funny
There he is when I have no where to turn to
No one for me to talk to
When I have somehting to say there he is to listen to me
Understands me, knows me
He is always there for me
and I am always there for him

I will never leave his side cuz I know he won't leave mine
There he will be and so will I.
As long as he holds my hand I will never let go. 
When I feel like I have no one to hold on to
There he will always be

It will be the same as the rest cuz nothing never changes.It's like my heart has a hole in it and everytime I try to make it better I seem to somehow fuck it up. Whishful thinking I guess should be the words use here. I think I should start thinking about what I feel and being true to my feeling....but I can't there is no reason to. It just hurts in the in....I need to remember my place and I will let this feeling wash over me. Take it in and just become it. feel in and understand there can be nothing more or nothing less. I wish I didn't feel like this and I know alot of people don't understand why I feel like this....I don't even know why I feel like this. I wish really knew....maybe I do and I rather not say it cuz once I say it I can't take it back. So there for this feeling will stay in me. This hurt and heartach will stay in me as well. I must remember to smile and pretend everything is alright cuz if I don't people will start to wonder and that would be the death of me if people didn't see a smile on my face. Cuz Casey always has to smile...Casey can never have a bad day and if I do I get yelled at for it. So I might has well play along with everything right. I don't want to be here anymore I don't want to put up with all this shit sometimes I do wish that I was nothing and nothing never happen to me...But then again I am greatful I can feel theses things and try to make sence of them. The heartach everything maybe it will make me a stronger person...I know I'm smart in all the wrong ways but it's not like they teach you this shit at school. why your feeling it. I know why and forever will. I have no idea why I feel like crying and why my heart feels like being torn out. It's like I'm in a hole that I can never get out of. And no one is going to save me...Which I guess if fine with me. I'm forever doomed in this cuz I'm the one that put myself like this. I'm the one who is making myself feel like this...no one else just me. I wish I could understand. I guess I have an act for making people feel like shit"

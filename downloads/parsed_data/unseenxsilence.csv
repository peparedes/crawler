I heard her talkin to some woman while i was in the dressin room sayin how she never seen me dress so nice before its all new to her. My moms so cute i love her. 

Went out to panera bread wit katie rufo and dmac too. i love that place. we ended up stayin there from 1- 3 jus talkin. good times..i love those girls. Me and ruf stopped by Glo and bought tannin packages for a month. i never went tannin before so this should be interestin.

Ive been listenin to her for many years but never actually watched her perform. Her voice is absolutely beautiful and her lyrics are the kind that make you sit back and think for a second. Very impressive. my genre of music goes from one extreme to the next. i love it. Which reminds me...me and a bunch of friends are goin to see BAYSIDE, the Junior Varsity, and A Second Chance may 17th down in philly. And jus 11 days later im goin to see Kenny Chesney. haha 

Me and jimmy put the new head unit in the camaro today. i'll have to burn a new cd jus in celebration. lol. and to top it off i got my Brand New tshirt in the mail today. its red and has a pacman skull and bones on it and says ""brand new"". So sweet.    

Ive had the same song on repeat for literally 30 minutes and have yet to get tired of it....

"event","i had my first interview for a nursing scholarship today. There were only 15 applicants and 3 recipients so i was feelin pretty confident. I was a lil late gettin there bc ap had a field trip to the constitution center which was actually quite interestin. So i get there and pretty much every one is already there...as i look around i notice that all these girls look like they are 23, dressed up from skirts to business suits and attend the nicest high schools around my area. I look like im 16, rockin some dickies and a collared shirt all exhausted from lookin at exhibits since 9am. But i figure they wont be concerned about that. So im still feelin good and confident. Now i never been to an interview before so im expectin it to be jus an one on one or maybe 2 people interview. They call my name and i walk into a room with 7 women sittin around a desk with a single empty chair infront. oh this is nice *good feelin gone* it turned out they were actually all quite sweet. They asked simple questions and i gave good answers (atleast i thought so). I guess i'll figure that out later when their decision comes back. Either way it was a good experience... 

my schedule got switched for tom. i work 8-4 instead of 2-9. I dread wakin up early but atleast i have the night to myself. I have to call out sunday for a thing at my college for the students accepted in my major. I dont really want to go but i figure im gonna be spendin the better half of the next four years of my life there..might as well...what do i got to lose? 

The cd player in the camaro jus decided not to work anymore. I cant function wit out music. The radio sux. Philadelphia does not have ONE  alternative radio station. what is with that shit!!? damn that makes me mad...and i hate commercials wit a passion...

The downfall of knowin so many people is the possibilities wit each of them.It makes me think of the times listenin to my dad talkin to an old friend. they'll bring up an old friends name and some one will chime in with a simple straight face ""oh know they died a couple years ago"" no shocked faces, no pause in conversation..nuttin. weve become accustomed to it. now that i look around at my own life its becomin the same. Still in high school and i can relate to that. how sad.

Datin back to thursday night when my stomach decided to upchuck until mid friday afternoon. i swear i was gonna have to search for a lung or my tounge through the bucket of my vomit. Fortunately by friday night i was feelin ok. sat was spent layin around until my playoff game. A game that we lost by 37 points haha. not too bad considerin they were the best team in all of the surroundin counties and their number one player was 6'6"". dead serious...i was swattin at her elbows all night...so funny to watch i bet. The loss was actually a good thing....bball season is finally over...woohoo. i felt like crap for the rest of the night into this mornin. i woke up so incredibly cranky i felt bad for anybody around me. my mom tried to cheer me up so she offered to go out and blow $200 at the mall. i bet she regrets that. i know i do. i ended up actually not buyin anythin..i was too miserable. and i had absolutely no reason to be...jus one of those moods that is nearly impossible to get me out of. By the end of the day my mom wanted to strangle me and i wanted to punch her in her eyelid. haha so eventually my mom was jus like aight..youre mood is bringin me down michelle i cant be around you...haha so we came home. haha we love eachother so much!

then i decided to go over danas. as soon as i got there i felt so relieved. It jus felt great to be around her. she determined that i have two moods. extremely happy or terribly cranky. no inbetween. i tried to deny it but i couldnt. haha she caught me. i tried to be cranky but that lasted for about 10 minutes. shes too cute. i cant be cranky. then to top it off she gave me this absolutely adorable teddy bear. hes rockin a red hoody wit a heart on it and it has 2005 embroidered on the sleeves. its sooo me. i smile everytime i look at him. as of now hes nameless...someone come up wit a cute name for him please. lol..i also got chocolate and a funny card...cracks me up. that girl...damn. i was sad bc i only got to spend an hour wit her bc i had softball practice...darn. she made my night though."

The first man sighs. ""Well,"" he says, ""actually, that seat belongs to me. I was supposed to watch the game with my wife, but she passed away. This is the first Super Bowl we haven't watched together since we got married in 1957."" 

Now the second man feels his heart jump into his throat. He is momentarily at a loss for words. 

""Oh,"" he says, ""I am so very sorry to hear that. It's terrible. I feel terrible. But couldn't you find someone else, another loved one, even a neighbor, to take the seat."" 

The first man slowly shakes his head no. 

""I would if I could,"" he says. ""But they're all at the funeral."" 


ITS SUPER BOWL SUNDAY BIIOOTCHHH!!!!!!!!!!"

Im not that excited about it but its a big deal for coaches and parents. everything is decorated and stuff. At the beginnin of the varsity game the player and their mom and dad are announced and walk on to the court then presented with balloons, roses, senior (parting) gifts all that good stuff. its cute, jus not my style. 

i have 6 hours to kill before my game...i'll probally be back to update again soon. :)"

"event","Senior year is a joke. maybe thats jus because i go to ap but still. Its 11am and im done school for the day. I have 2 classes on day 2 so i can leave after 2nd block at 10:45. Trust me, im not complaining. i jus think its funny how high school is preparing you for college and ive had more work and harder classes as a freshmen. 
day 1 i have the normal math and P.O.D. then a study hall which i sleep in and gym class. is it necessary to take 4 years of gym in high school? rediculous. 

to go from applied math first block which consist of kids as dumb as bricks or jus lazy as all hell to honors P.O.D. with, as mr weaver would say ""the best of the best of ap"", is hard to get used to. i swear some of the kids in that class spend their spare time reading the dictionary. the kid that sits to my right nearly cried when he got a paper handed back wit a 95.

Mr rayer scares me. i've never been so intimidated by a teacher, or a person in general for that matter. hes very nice, funny, animated, intelligent but there is jus somethin about that man that makes me extremely nervous. i never feel like what i write is enough. And durin the whole block hes pretty much talking so youre writin down every word he says. but it still doesnt feel like enough. if you dont pay attention for 2 secs you miss out on sooo much and hes the type of teacher that will ask you a question infront of everyone, knowin that you cant answer it, jus to embarass you. i like him....:)"

My bro took me snowboardin for the first time and let me tell ya...oh man is that fun. painful but fun. one would think that fallin in snow wouldnt hurt. no no....very very painful, especially when you flip 3 times and the snow decides to go up all 4 of your shirts and down 2 pairs of pants. how it does that is beyond me but it does. Its so hard tryin to learn somethin for the first time but once you get the hang of it...awesome. and my bro is the man. i love spendin time wit him. we get along so well its scary. 

i'll admit it..at first i thought ""damn this jus isnt meant for me"" but by the end of the night i was rippin. if there was a jump id hit it, a steep drop id ride it. i nearly killed 20 other skiers and boarders in the process but hell it was well worth it. besides the fact it was 15 degrees below zero wit a the wind chill and it snowin all day and the bruised ass and only god knows what else, it was soo sweet. i'll find out what else is damaged in the mornin when i cant roll out of bed. 

but its official. i def picked up a new sport. now i gotta go out and buy my own boots board and bindings. theres goes $200. why do all the sports i love cost so much? lol

"event","Philly had thier first snowfall of winter today. At first i was admiring the view from my 4th block class. Theres something about the way the snow falls that makes it so beautiful. Nothin like rain. Rain is consistant when it falls, unless altered by wind. But snow has no pattern. its everywhere goin every which direction as it falls. Makes the landscape look so nice.. a white cover over all the uglyness of the cities. From the windows i could see my car in the distance then it struck me ""shit now i gotta go shovel off my car! god dammit!""

Driving in it is so much fun though. Except when you have stupid retard drivers who act like they never seen a snowflake before. all sorts of panicing...i swear their foot never leaves the break. 5 mph jus doesnt cut it and they wonder why they get stuck. 

One snowflake lands around here and its like the whole world came to a schreeching hault. Every bridge or street with THE slighest decline was blocked off with police officers. Granted, there was an inch of ice beneath the snow but the fact remains ....its not the end of the world! geez. So it took me 45 minutes to get back to ap which on a normal day takes 3 minutes. If the street wasnt blocked by cops there was some genius that managed to get stuck on a snowflake and block the entire street. Its not that serious people. come on!

Snows pointless if it doesnt delay or cancel school. Beautiful though...especially after it covers all the grass and everythin is untouched. But that doesnt last too long. Damn neighbors 6 billion kids trample all over it. I jus wanna put up an electric fence and watch em fry. haha im jus kiddin. *smile*"

I somehow find
You and I collide""

"event","So its just about 1:30 and Im still up. Real cool. I honestly just dont know what to do with myself anymore.

Graduation is... oh...today. I cant even get over how weird that is. And how f'ing tired Im going to be.

Everything has been strange. I dont know what it is. Ive been so weird, and felt so weird... and sometimes I let my emotions take over me. And Im not even saying this to be gay... but like I've been acting on how I feel. And I'll tell other people. Which is good I guess becuase then I can have my own ""peace of mind"" but I feel like an ass after I do it. I guess what Im trying to do is justify what Ive done. I honestly feel like an idiot. For what Ive said. For what Ive felt. And it sucks becuase I cant control this.

Im afraid for next year. For not having the security of a smaller school. And seeing the same people every day. And that I wont see people I want to. I hate being the one who always has to make an effort. But I guess I will becuase I just care that much. Sometimes I just wish I didnt care as much as I do. I totally over-analyze things too.

I also love how I beat around the bush in this... but I cant say any names so whatever.


WOW. tomorrows gonna suck becuase I'll be dead tired. I guess I should go.... KBye."

Exams were this past week. I didn't study at all. I actually am kind of proud. I had like 3 anyways, and they weren't hard. I got a day off too! I love senior year.
Riss and I went out to a Chinese Buffet after exams on Friday. Yay for Chinese people and their food! Anyways, we had a pretty good talk about colleges and such. I kind of want to stay in Manchester and go to MCC and get like a apartment or something. I think that would be super hot. But I also want to live on a campus... like Merrimack. I hope I get in. Even UConn would be a super fun campus... hmmm... wonder why. It's only like the number ONE party school. lol. Storrs... sooo in the middle of nowhere.
I bought Napoleon Dynamite. It's only like the best movie ever. I made Riss watch it. Now I don't have to steal Leahs. Haha.. Jennifer Dynamite. I love Leahs padre. Fun.
Friday night I went out with Megs and Loreen to Outback, and Matt met us there. It was good times. Then we froze our asses of watching a little bit of backyard hockey. Interesting. Megs is going to corrupt me, we've decided. lol. It's okay. I need it.
I had to work at 8 this morning. Sucks so bad. I'm sooo not a morning person. And I get to do it again next Sat. Blah.
So there's like a big blizzard going on right now! Yay! I love snow. Except for when I can't drive. I hope everyone has school on Monday though, because East has it off... and that would be a rip if everyone got it off... mwaha.


Thats whiter than what's spillin down your throat....  :-o"

"event","So I've decided that vacations suck. Don't get me wrong, I love being able to sleep in and stay up late and oh yeah NOT GO TO SCHOOL, but I get bored as hell.  I don't think there's anything worse then being bored. Or having awesome plans get messed up. It just sucks. I'd rather be working and making money.
Sometimes I want to just let it all go. Just be like to hell with what other people think, and what I SHOULD be thinking. I want to go do something crazy.  Not stupid crazy. Just... well.... different.  Im getting so sick of the same old crap. I need something new. I need something different. I need something to look forward to, something to keep me waking up in the morning.
I talked to Meg today... I always love our talks. We seem to be on the same page for the most part, on most issues.  Thats always good to have. Shes one of the only people I feel I can talk to about almost anything, without her judging me. I love talking to my other friends, but sometimes I feel like Im boring them or being an inconvinience.
I've been listening to morning view a lot recently. Its like my god. I love that CD. The lyrics, the music... just everything about it I love.  It reminds me of last year though. I can remember how I was feeling when I listen to it. It's so weird. It makes me like go back in time. And its weird becuase its the same time around the hippodrome... which was tonight. :/   Whatever."

I got some way cool presents though like comfy clogs and RUDOLPH and a BALL ((for excersising ;-P ))  We went out for dinner on my B-day then band concert.  They played ""Happy Birthday"" for me!! Hahaha.... what a suprise!  It was cute but also embarassing. Oh well!
Saturday I worked then we went out once again for my B-day with Grandma at Macaroni Grill! yum yum.
Sunday was really weird.  Work was weird.  Then I went to school for the X.mas party and the lot was DEAD EMPTY... and I was sooo confused cuz I was there at the right time.  And I called Care and Care and no one answered their phones.  So then I went through the drive through and ordered the WRONG meal and got a huge angus burger that cost like 6 dollars!!! Wooo weee... So weird. 
Snow day today! **** yay for snow ****
Only 2 days till Leah and I go out for my bday and maybe other fun activites.

I've decided that going to MCC actually is quite reasonable.  I would only do it for two years, but I would save money, get a car, be able to keep my job, work with the same people, and be home.  The only bad part would be LIVING at home.  That would actually suck.  So yeah. The college hunt continues. I have already done 3 applications so Im stoked about that. But I might not get in so whatever.
And also I love like 4 people so thats cool.  I don't know why I always like bad people though, and its so weird because Im actually not bad.  Like Im not a troublemaker or anything. Im kind of a goody goody, or conservative at least.  It weird.
Im getting contacts tomorrow. So stoked and scared. hmmm. I think it'll be nice though.  :)

One second Im like so excited and happy and the next I swear to God I want to die.  It gets real old, and real annoying.

Yesterday in Seminar we wrote down things that we are afriad of, or just anything that was worrying us at the time.  Most people wrote something along the lines of college, or being alone.  Of course we are all afraid/nervous about going to college, but I thought I was the only one afraid of being alone for the rest of my life.  Most people in that room are smart, and funny, and overall ""perfect"" people.  It just boggles my mind how much we all think alike, but no one really expresses themselves and their TRUE feelings.  That is why I love seminar.  The meats are awesome.  I wish I could gain the courage to talk and share my opinions more though.  I really hate that, becuase every time I walk out of the room I walk out with a feeling of regret.  It also upsest me that only this type of friendship and openness has to occur during class.  We tried taking it beyond that, but it never works.  I don't think it will.

Besides finishing applications, I am so excited to finish up senior year and go off to college. I honestly don't think I have made that clear enough, especially in this lj. lol.  I want a fresh start.  I want to be outgoing and fun and an all around good person.  I don't know why I have to wait until next year to do this, but I think the whole atmosphere will help my cause a little more.  Being away from home and everything else.

I've decided that I shouldn't sugar-coat anything that I write in here.  It's a journal. It's supposed to be the truth.  Not that I lie in here.  But I want to start being brutally honest, and not make myself seem any different for the convience of anyone reading this (if anyone even does).  I don't know if its the best thing to spill my guts out here, and tell my deepest secrets or wishes or whatever but it helps to get it out.  It's easier for me to type this and write it, rather than talk to someone. 

Soooo... thats kind of like my resolution or whatever. I am trying to change. Its just so hard."

"event","So a couple things before I start: The Red Sox won the world series, I got my license and the world is going to hell (aka we are stuck with BUSH for FOUR MORE YEARS!!)   That was a pretty good week, I must say, besides the latest news of Bush.  Speaking of politics, I saw Team American with Meg, Leah, and Brendan.  It was soooo funny and I'm already planning to get the soundtrack becuase it was that good.  So many terrorist jokes and plenty of puppet sex.  I definetly give it 4.5 stars.
In other news, Homecoming was this weekend... but I didn't go.  For some reason EC dances are so gay, or homecoming at least.  Also, I heard that there was like puddles of sweat all over the place and it was so gross.  So I'm glad that I stayed home and did absolutely NOTHING, besides dying my hair red and other lame shiz.  Leah and I were supposed to go to fright fest but she got sick, and other people just never called me back so thats cute.
Lately it seems as though everything is falling apart.  I already have senioritis.  I don't think I have done my homework at HOME in like two years, besides typing papers maybe.  And I am too lazy to do my applications, so I have done zero so far.  I feel like I don't have any friends any more too.  Me, meg and Leah went out for Halloween, but it just doesnt feel the seem, like it used to.  I feel so out of the loop and far away from them.  Sometimes I don't even consider myself friends with them, I mean what if they don't even like me.  I always feel like Im intruding, and they always have something better to do.  I hate feeling this way, it pisses me off so much.  I don't know why Im in such a crappy mood right now either.  I want to change everything thats going on so bad, and I know that I cant and that makes it all the worse. rahhhh.... Im just glad the OC is on tonight.  :)
Something to look forward to."

"event","Time goes by so fast... and not only when you're having fun.  This year is honestly FLYING by.  It's redonkulous. Here's a glimpse of the past week/weekend:


Friday::  Visited Windsor.. I fell asleep as usual cuz Im a bum.  Then meghan and I went out for her b-day to Applebees.  We got yummy food and desserts and tried to stall for a long time so we could watch the game, and we had to wait for my mom anyways.... Then we went to the mall for a sec. and got bored so ended up talking, then we waited for my mom and some random 24 yr old talked to us and that was cute.  Red Sox game was canceled  :(   I went to bed early anyways


Saturday:: Woke up early and left for Assumption... took a tour and all that jazz.  The campus was pretty nice, and it was good overall, but it didn't really jump out at me... I think I'll apply there anyways.  The we left and drove on over to Merrimack, where we just missed the tours, so we got a mini private one and then ate in the cafe.  Merrimack was wicked nice, and I really liked it, so I'll apply there too.  Then when we got home we went to the Uconn supershow or whatever it is for the women.  It was fun when there were colored flashy lights and they called the players names, but then it got boring, and so we left.  Watched Red Sox.



Sunday:: Worked 11-3.  Made some big bucks. lol.  Then I went out to Starbucks with Nick for Seminar and we had our talk.  It was really nice to talk to someone and getting to know him.  I had a really great time, and would def. do it again...... 


Monday:: School...CCD.. I realized kids annoy me so much.  seminar meat at night.  Wicked cool.  Red Sox won in ""overtime""... boo-yah.

Tuesday:: School. Red Sox once again.

Wednesday:: No school!!!!!! Riss and I went out for brunch at Bickfords.  I think the eggs made me sick.  :(
Then we went to Home Depot to get rollers to paint, and picked up Josh, her new bf then painted... so now I'm home... dance tonight and then the Red Sox WILL WINNNNN!!!!!!!!!!"

I'm actually so glad that they make us do those for enlgish class.  I thought mine was pretty good too.  Kinda long, but Im such a good writer.  :-D
Took the SATs this am.  I actually hate standardize tests.  I have such bad ADD, like after the first hour I just can't sit still anymore.  It's redonkulous.  Anyways, I took them at RHS and it was soooo unorganized. Honestly, I mean I hate East, but damn, we've got it together.
I go for my license test in 19 days.  I have to pass. I HAVE to.
Not much else is going on.  I've hung out with melissa and meg a little, like today after SATs we drove around and got fries. It was fun/funny.
I dunno.  I don't see a whole lot of my friends, and Im actually sick of having to call them all the time, and not even getting a call back when I leave a message.  So you know what.  I give up.  You wanna do something??  Then call me,bitch.  Im not gonna intrude on your life anymore if you don't want me to.
College here I come.  Once again, I must state the fact that I cannot wait to leave here."

Once again, I cannot wait until I get my license.  It's actually coming faster then I though it would.  I think I might fail though.  If I did, I may just have to kill myself, but we'll see about that one later.  
Other news, I've been getting a ride in, so thats AWESOME, for so many reasons...biggest one being that I don't have to take the bus.  But I wish I could just make it an official ride to school instead of having to call every night to confirm it.  That's so gay.
Oh... another fun thing... I joined the school newspaper.  It's kinda dorky, but it'll be something else to put on college applications.  So anyways, I have to write this article on teens voting and stuff like that.  It seemed kinda cool when he told me about it, and I thought it wouldn't be that hard.  But now Im thinking, when the heck am I going to have time to do this... or when am I going to WANT to do this?  What did I get myself into.  I'm just piling the work on... smooth move.
Dance starts this wednesday.  I'm so pumped.  I cannot wait to start it again.  It's so fun and it'll keep me active and somewhat in shape until I can actually drive and join and gym and all that fun stuff!!!

I also got a ride in to school with John so thats fun also.  I really can't wait until I can drive.  I will rule... and also Meghan and I will get gym memberships and go there a lot and work out and be hot.  I've decided that.  I have also decided that I am losing a lot of my friends.  I don't talk to them anymore.  It's weird and sad.  Especially when some of them don't call me back.  Whatever.  Your Loss.  :-D
Another thing:  I can't wait until I go to college.  I know I have said this so many times before, but I truly mean it.  When we moved Sarah in the other day, I was just like man... I cannot wait for my turn. 
Something else that's weird, there's like no one in my life right now, like guys or anything.  I don't even really like anyone.  I know... gasp.  Even I'm shocked.  It's bizarre.  But I guess I see how my friends are with their bfs and it's just like... ummm... why put yourself through that.  So... I'm sure that this time around it will be more serious, or not serious at all. Hmmm... Either way.  I think it's safer to like someone you can NEVER get and is far out of reach.  The ""chase"" is more fun.  I like having crushes better.  It's not as fun when you actually have to be stuck with this person.  So whatever... there's my deep thinking for tonight.
I'm excited to watch TV tonight, which is lame, but it's so much better than having to work at night, until 10, just to get into bed smelling like a cheeseburger.  Tonight I can do whatever I want. Kinda.

Other fun things... I missed work one day cuz we went to the beach and Im an idiot and didn't see my name on the schedule... so that was special.
I just bought a digital camera which is awesome and it's like my fickin lover.  It's so awesome and I bought it from this wicked hot guy at Circuit City... definetly a plus.  
Ummm... school is gay but my schedule is pretty good this year, except for gym which is lame becuase there's 11 people in my class.
My sister and I saw the Princess Diaries today.  It was pretty good to my suprise. Whatever.

Worked from 2-5 which was pretty awesome becuase Michael put me on booths, so I got to work the last 4.  It wasn't really busy though, so I didn't make as much money as i usually do, only 15 but thats not too bad for three hours!!!  Then my mom and sister came and picked me up and we went to Cingular and got stuck there!!! Our car just totally stopped working for some reason... but so many people came over to see if we needed help and tried to jump our car, but none of it worked.  So finally AAA came and did something and it started to work... but some guy drove me and Sarah to BOBS where she had the truck.  And I changed into random clothes that we had in the car then met Melissa and Leah at Worcester St. pizza looking two years old in the clothes,, but oh well then Nikki and Britney came and then we went to the mall and got free underwear from Victorias Secret becuase Mel had some card....  Then to the movies and we saw Bourne Supremacy which was actually pretty good, only it would have been better if I had seen the first one.  All in all a good night.  Girls night I guess.


::Saturday::

Grandma came over for lunch/dinner and Leah came over later too then we went to church... Leah stayed and we looked at old pictures of me... lol... becuase im so self absorbed. jk. And then Brendan ditched her ((loser)) so we went to Friendlys and Mel met up with us... and it was so much fun and then Mel had car paint so we wrote on her car ""Got Crabs"" cuz she has this little crab guy in her rear dash thing.  Then she drove me and Leah home and it was some good bonding time with her in the car.


::Sunday::

Woke up at ((OMG)) 4 for the plane to GA... so early, but I actually woke up.  My mom was going crazy trying to get us there and stuff, but I was kinda over tired so I was all hyper.  The plane right i got to sit next to this AWESOME woman who I thought was gonna hurl on me, and she was like convulsing and stuff so that was fun... not.  And also she fell asleep a lot.  When I finally got to sleep we were there! It wasn't a bad flight though, only like two hours.  Then we got picked up at the airport and went back to my aunts house, which is really nice btw.


I'll save the rest for later cuz this is already pretty long, so yeah!!!!!!!!!! I'm having fun so yay.  :)"

The last two days of school I always see in peoples profiles things such as ""Summer '04 its gonna kick ass"" and other crap like that.  And then towards the middle of the summer, people find themselves bored with nothing to do.  I'm not really complaining, becuase I love going to bed late and waking up in the afternoon and not having to worry about school and homework.  But some part of me really wants to go back to school.  I know, gasp.  I mean I don't want to go back to school, becuase thats just one more thing I have to worry and stress over, but at least I'll have some kind of a schedule.  I hate how I can't say that I've accomplished anything this summer, but then again I don't really know many other people that can.  I wish that I could skip senior year and just move on to college.  I am so excited to move into a new place and start a whole new ""life"" basically, or a whole new part of my life.  I guess I'm just really bored with what has been going on lately, which frankly, is nothing.  I haven't hung out or even talked to some of my friends in so long.  Everyone just does their own things, and we're all busy at different times, and things just never work out.  And then some other people that I'm ""friends"" with I just haven't even talked to bascially all summer.  But I don't really care.  I'm not going to be the one to establish things anymore.  I hate that.  I hate having to be the one who calls all the time and asks to do something.  If you really want to hang out or talk, then pick up the phone, bitch.  High school is so lame.  I can honestly say that I have not made on new or close friend during high school.  There's people I've talked to occasionally and maybe hung out with once or twice, but no realy friendships.  All my friends are people that I've known since middle school and even pre-school.  If I could go back to the end of 8th grade I would most definetly stay with Coventry High.  I wish I could see what it would be like if I did go there.  For some reason I feel like life would be a whole lot easier and I would be so much happier.  All I know about this whole high school thing is that at the end of this year, I will not miss a single thing from East Catholic.  I can honestly say that, for now anyways.  Who knows what senior year will bring.  I'm hoping it will be better, but who knows.  They say these are supposed to be the best days of our lives, but how come they seem like the worst?  I hate this age so much.
The bright side of all this nonsense is going to be Sunday when I leave for Georgia!  I can't wait.  I don't even know why.  It's not like we're going somewhere super-cool to do something totally fun.  I guess Im just glad to have a different routine and be out of the house, and be out of CT.  It will be a nice change.  I'll make sure of it.
Until Next Time....."

"event","I bought a fish!  It's so cute and I love it.  He's a betta fish... with oh not just one... but TWO names...Pirana-Eugene.  Meghan thought his name should be Eugene and Leah said Pirana so I named him both!!!  I love him so much. lol.  Leah's taking him when we go away so that should be fun, I'm just kinda afraid he'll die or something, not becuase of Leah but just becuase they're so sensitive or whatever, and even the smallest thing can kill them....
So friday my mom and I went shopping, and thats when I bought my fishy!!! We went to Panera for dinner and saw Riss and then later her Leah and Mel slept over. It was a grand time.  We ate lots of junk food, and didnt really do anything but it was fun... excpet for Riss's eye hurt her  :(          
I also got to talk to Meghan, who's in Texas... lucky her!  It sounded like she was having a lot of fun, which is good becuase she'll be there for a while.  I miss her soooo much too, we haven't hung out in soooo long.  Definetly gonna be a huge party when everyone is back in CT.  :o)
Sunday I was supposed to go to Amy's 30th B-day party and to 6 flags for the Ashlee Simpson concert... but... oh thats right I'm a huge idiot and I took someones hours from work.  For some reason I thought she said Monday, but then I looked at the schedule and it was Sunday.  I actually wanted to cry, becuase I always take peoples hours and then I regret it.... so I'm never doing that again.  So we went to church and then I had to work at 3 and I missed the concert and her birthday and it sucked...  :(     I made $24 though, which is actually good seeing as I've been making like $10 becuase its sooooo slow.
So I'm not sure whats going on this week, nothing huge to look forward to, hopefully I'll be able to go to the beach finally.... And Georgia is in less than 2 weeks!!! I'm so excited, just to leave CT and go somewhere else where its nice and warm and beautiful!!!
Oh yeah!!! I forgot I'm gettting my haircut on Thurs!!! Im so excited becuase hopefully I'll get it styled or layered or something and it'll look H-O-T, and most importantly be easier to deal with!  I also think we're going out with the Keglers one night so that should be fun!!! I love them. lol. They're awesome.
Well I'm probably gonna wake up at 12 at this rate, so I should go to bed."

"event","This past weekend was my 4th Steubenville... which is so hard to believe becuase it seems like just yesterday.  Anyways, we left early in the am which kinda sucked, but I rested on the bus.  We went to St.Annes and ate lunch and had a mass and sang and stuff then drove to LaSallette.... and finally after what seemed like 5 hours we were registered and got to set ourselves up in the tent.  Mel came later that night and I was sooooooo excited that she was finally up cuz I love her!!!!  So all in all it was a good time but Im too lazy to go into details.... and this feeling that I always get from it is still here but I know won't last for that long.  Oh well.
Leah and I hung out yesterday and went for a bike ride then to the drive in and fil snuck in with his friend and sat with us and it was interesting sneaking back out, especially since we were soaked... :/  Oh well... it was fun and worth it for me anyways.
Today grandma came over and we played agrravation with her and then ate dinner and stuff.  On the way home we stopped to look at a car which will POSSIBLY/HOPEFULLY will be mine in the near future... haha but who knows, we have to go back tomorrow when they're open to discuss it.
So I'll just keep that little ounce of hope becuase right now everything else is kind of blah... probably more so becuase I have PMS but whatever.  Also Im not eating anymore so thats fun.  And Im done being gay."

"event","It feels like I haven't written in here in sooooo long... so much has happened, and I can't even remember.  Last weekend my mom went away so it was just me and my sister at home..all alone...score.  Anyways, Leah and Mel slept over and we had some interesting times, nothing that I can really post, but something that we definetly will not forget.
Then on Monday we drove up to Lake George and stayed with the Ripps at their lake house there. It was sooooo beautiful, the lake was right by the mountains and it was just awesome.  And my mom and I learned how to kayak too which was fun! I was a natural at it. lol.  Then we ate and then John took us out on their boat for a little tour... which was neat.  We basically left Tuesday morning, so we didn't get to spend that much time there becuase Sarah had to work so we had to leave  :(
We didnt even get to go swimming, and I dont think I've been swimming AT ALL this summer so far, which kinda sucks.
And work... omg I've been working so much... not all that much but enough. I work every wednesday night, which totally sucks becuase thats the drive-in night, so everyone else goes and I'm workin it at the glenn. poo.
However, good news is, that I might be bumped up to booths soon.  One of the managers said that I'll be starting on them soon, because once school starts so many people will be leaving and stuff, so it'll just be us.  And I guess I'm pretty good anyways ;)
Yeah and we saw the notebook last night which was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sad. And it was a really good movie too, but really sad... and the people really loved each other and it made me sad becuase I want something like that... it was so nice...  :(

SO now Im off to a picnic thingy I believe!!! Happy Birthday to Melissa.... on the 4th of July!!!!!"

"event","I actually think that summer has begun, or at least gotten fun. To be honest, I am sick and tired of waking up at 12am just to roll into the living room and sit on my ass and watch tv. I mean I have no complaints, its not like I hate watching tv or just lounging around, but its so damn boring.
So finally I went out and did something yesterday!!!  Leah told me to come on over to her house, so I got out of my pj's and walked over there.  We talked and ate brownies and then came to my house and got strawberry daquiri mix and made ""smoothies"" and watched American Wedding.  Then Mel stopped by and we finished the movie than watched some MTV.  At around 5 or so we finally left though, becuase Leah had to go to one of Wendys kids b-day parties or something, so Melissa brought me home and we talked in the drive-way (while sitting in her car) and she made prank calls, and we made regular calls, and it was a grand time.
Later, Sarah came home and we went to Panera for dinner, my treat of course, where Riss waited on us.  The food was awesome as always, and than later I dropped a soup bowl!!! It was so loud and everyone got really silent, and I was like OMG MARISSA I JUST BROKE A BOWL!!!! So that was fun times.
Then Sarah and I went to the movies, but none were playing at that time so we went to the mall, and spent the whole time in Aeropostale, and I bought some cute new capris and so did she, then we went back to the movies and saw Shrek 2 which was SOOOO cute and soooo funny, so it was an overall good time.
This morning was CHS graduation, so I went there and that was fun. We missed the calling of the names or whatever, so it wasnt as meaningful, but I got to say hello/goodbye/congradulations to Hillari and Dan, and other seniors that I knew.  So now after watching Kristinas knife demonstartion... I am so pooped.  Good thing I get to work from 5-10 tonight... woo hoo.

"event","So this week was pretty fun, considering I haven't had to work since last Saturday!  That always makes things better.  Leah and I went to Six Flags on Sunday which was HOT!!! We only went on a couple rides, but waited for like an hour to get on the superman, which is always worth the wait... best ride ever.  It was wicked nice to just spend a day with Leah and at Six Flags, so that was awesome.  Then Monday I went to the parade with my mom and Mrs.Pillion.  That was a fun time also, and I got to watch everyone march in band!!! Hahaha... so good.  And Melissa got to ride in the car becuase of her knee!!! I love you Melissa!
In other news... Graduation was last night.  It was really long and boring, but I was so excited to think that that was my last time playing with the band at graduation becuase next year I will be graduating!!!! I am so excited to graduate and go off to college... and I am really leaning towards Eastern becuase I really liked it, and I think its the most reasonable.
Tonight was dress rehersal for the recital... and suprisingly it was a lot of fun, except for the whole rushing around part before and trying to make it on time... oh well.. I really was into the dance this year, and I had a lot of fun up there, so thats awesome.... tomorrow we practice again becuase half our class was missing because of PROM!!! yay!  If anyone from CHS reads this, I hope you has TONS of fun!!!! I wish I could have been there with you  :(
Also, something that has been bothering me: my dreams... I had the weirdest but best dream last night. And I hate how they impact me so much, like I cannot stop thinking about it or whatever.  Im like obsessing, and its so weird but I can't help it.... rahhhh.... oh well.... maybe tonight will be good again!!!"

I've been working like a mofo, and I was thinking of quitting but then I realized that I make a lot of good money, so if anything I should stick it out until school starts next year, or I get fired...

Today we had senior farewell... it wasn't all that sad or fun or heck even interesting, but I was so excited to think that next year, that will be me. I cannot wait until I graduate. I think I realized how much I hate East Catholic... the people, the teachers, and just the school in general.  I know Im privelaged to go there, and that I should like it seeing as my mom pays like 7,000 or so for me to go there, but still.  I miss Coventry... I miss my friends, if they even are anymore. I dont know, I havent seen anyone in forever.

All I know is I cannot wait for summer... I cannot wait until I can drive... I cannot wait until Im happy and find whatever it feels like I'm missing."

I wish it would be the same as when we were kids... me and leah would stay up late walking, biking and talking on the walkie talkies and stuff..... life used to be so care-free and just relaxed... it seems like everything is so serious now... everyone has a damn stick up their ass or something... I dont know... I just want to get away and have fun.. senior year should be the best... I'll be able to drive (hopefully by summer actually) and it should just be awesome.

Rob, Greg, Riss, Shawn, Mel, Steven... and my neighbors!!! It may not seem like a lot but seriously, it's the best just to see someone I know, and maybe even wait on them.  The only thing I like about working there is when I leave with a big wad of money aka my tips... its awesome to get cash just like that. 
My mom said I might open up a checking account, which would be awesome, but I kinda don't trust myself.... I know I'm a spender.  At least my debt is going down!!! I figured out that our prom tickets will only cost $70 for both of us... and my mommy bought me my dress for Easter! which helps a whole lot... so now I just have my share of the ticket and drivers ed to pay off!!!  So maybe I'll be able to afford Dave tickets... or I'll just settle for a Six Flags pass, which works for me.  
Hey- let me know if any of you guys are interested in getting one, becuase its cheaper when you do a package of 4.

On that note... I should go... day off... and I have accomplished nothing... besides dishes... but I have soooo much work....yuck."

Then Rob came over and we watched 8 Mile, then Leah came over, and later me and her went to see The Crucible at CHS... pretty good, but the play was boring... then Leah slept over.

Sat- Left wicked early for Keene State... I sat in the back, and my butt hurt sooo much... we got there pretty early and just walked around. Then we sat and drank hot chocolate and listened to people go on and on for almost 3 hours... so boring... Leah and I were complaining like whoa... then went on a tour, and had to harass random people to see the dorms.  It was an okay school, but we left... and went to Applebees, then to Strawberries music store, and Leah bought ""the darkness"" CD... Then went to Yankee Candle and I bought some yummy smelling candles which was fun... then came home and watched UCONN win like whoa!!!

Sun- Went to 10 am mass with grama and mom... palm sunday... soooo long... then to shady glen to pick up my uniform!!! w00t.. then to the mall with Rob, met his fam. they were soooo funny and nice... good times.  Then I actually don't remember what I did after that... oh well!!!

Melissa slept over Wednesday night becuase she lost power, so she was here when the news came and everything, and I felt bad becuase I was crying and I think I kept her up... in the morning we had a 90 min. delay which was good, but then I still had to go to school with that crappy news which sucked so bad... so Thursday was one of the worst days becuase I also had 3 quizzes that I did really bad on I'm sure.  That same night we went up to Windsor, and it was really awkward and I felt so bad and weird and sad... and when Nick came and hugged my Nonno he just fell apart, and I just had to turn away it was so bad... But the only time I cried a little was when I was playing with Brianna and we saw pictures of all of us at Christmas and she said ""Im going to miss Nonnie at Christmas"" and I was like ""me too"" and then she also said that it was good how Nonnie would be up in heaven with my dad or ""uncle wilson""  Other then that I haven't really cried in front of anyone since this has happened... I dont know why but when Im at her house I guess I just feel comfortable or something, but when I get home and in bed or whatever, Im a wreck... I guess becuase thats when I start thinking of things.

And I didn't get to say much about the concert last night besides the fact that it was AWESOME!  I really like trapt.. they are good. It was so funny too, becase me and Mel made friends and I don't remember their names, but we were picking on this other guy in front of us who was the biggest DORK ever and kept moving and he was headbanging in all the wrong ways... he was basically swaying.. and at that concert.. you dont sway... so we made fun of him... but I thought he was kinda cute, so we can forgive him.  I must say I have way too much fun making fun of complete strangers... its like the best thing in the world, becuase you dont know them and they dont know you, and they dont know ur making fun of them so its all good.... Im so happy right now, and its awesome. I think I might go to bed in 20 min.

Oh!! Friday Rob asked me to prom during math, and of course I said yes! yay! I can't wait... its coming up pretty soon... and it should be fun... and I have the bestest date... only I have no money  :(
Riss's on Sat night was fun too... so many good times... And then last night Mel took me to the Sno Core Tour with her... at the Webster where Stratas, Finger 11, Smile Empty Soul, and of course Trapt... it was awesome... I think I stepped in puke in the bathroom but it was awesome. So yeah Im driving, so Im going to go."

We did the play today during school for middle school kids... it was soooo long but it was funny to see the kids reaction to the swears and make out scenes... good times.
Tomorrow should be a breeze I hope and then its good from thurr... Im really cold and sickly right now... Sarah and I just watched Billy Madison and it was so frickin funny... but I ate too many cashews and I feel really gross... blah.
Tues. night I learned to play setback at the O'Connors... MP and I were on a team against Sarah and Neil.. it was good fun, esp. cuz me and MaryPatizzle made up wicked cool hand signals and we got points for just playing... I'm actually a card goddess... so Neil said he'd take me to play with the ""big boys"" on Friday some time. lol. I want to gamble. Thats so bad.
I think Im going to go to bed becuase Im wicked tired."

"event","This weekend has been pretty awesome... very laid back and relaxing, which is always good.  Friday night Riss and I went to Panera for dinner and then to Kates house where we ""watched"" a movie, but we basically just hung out and fooled around... good times.
Saturday... I was at school from 9-5 for practice which should be illegal!!! And when I got out I was soooo happy and I just wanted to run around.  Neil came over and brought over the playstation which is set up in my room right now! yay!  Leah slept over last night, she came over pretty late so we played playstation and then watched grind but I fell asleep during it... but playstation is awesome especially smackdown which Leah and I tried to play and of course The Rock and Trish Stratuss beat whoever Leah was!!  Then this am we went to church and then to Edmonsons to fill out a job application, and it was so gay and I felt like the biggest ass becuase I didnt know my social security number, and then Leah said she changed her mind and didnt want to fill out a paper... so it was pretty weird.  
I was supposed to drive today too, but my mom didnt let me and Sarah had the car so I stayed home and cleaned my room and 
re-organized the playstation and vcr becuase I've decided that its staying there FOREVER if I can help it!
This week is probably going to suck ass... but hopefully I'll be able to find some things to look forward to."

"event","I can't believe that its already the weekend... this week has gone by super-fast which is excellent.  
Thursay I went to see the Passion, which was very surreal.  I mean it wasn't life-changing or anything, but it did touch me a little and made me realize some things... and even though some people said it was really really gory, I honestly didn't think that it was that bad... I could actually stomach all the blood and stuff... I mean if there was someone puking, then that'd be different, but it was just blood, and I can take that.
Yesterday the ""fasting"" began... haha... although I cheated somewhat... I guess I just cant have an eating disorder on command.. it just happens.  Anyways, there was some activites last night which was fun... Mel and Autumn and others were there and it wasn't bad... and then I got home and slept like it was my job.
This am we went to the CCSU open house.  It has a wicked nice campus and dorm rooms, but it was too boring for me. There were like 4 people there, and nothing was going on... and when I go to college I don't really plan on coming home every weekend, so I want it to be fun.  Hopefully Eastern is better cuz thats where me and Mel always planned to go!!!  wooo baby!  That would actually be awesome... we'll have to see... the college hunt continues..   :)

I love all of you!"

"event","So this whole week has been weird... it went by kind of fast... and at the same time last week seems so far away.  And so much has changed too which is really weird.
I hope going back to school will make things less weird, and more back on a scheduel or whatever...i just feel really empty right now though. Its weird, because its like Im not fufilled or whatever... I mean I go out and have fun, but its all a blur, and its kind of like I have not accomplished anything. 

So in other news, My Nonnie is in the hospital, I guess my aunt found her on the floor or something, so theyre doing tests on her right now in the hospital... she could have had a mini stroke or something along those lines.  We went up there today, to Hartford Hospital, to see her... and she looked fine, shes been mumbling lately and speaking in Italian... so shes kind of losing her mind, and shes gettting really skinny and weak.  I dont know how long she'll last but I just hate that all of this crap has to happen all at the same time."

"event","I got this from  http://maddox.xmission.com/26_things.html    and its about the 26 things guys should do for girls or something like that. And I must admit, I totally think the things on this list are cute, but I read what this guy wrote about it and I laughed my ass off... enjoy....



1. Know how to make you smile when you are down! 
When will women realize that they don't live on the set of a romantic comedy? Unless making you smile involves me playing video games while you cook me a steak, you're in for a disappointment. You don't think guys ever feel ""down?"" The door swings both ways, bitch. 

2. Try to secretly smell your hair, but you always notice. 
What? Why the hell would I want to smell a woman's hair? It smells bad enough with all the sprays and perfume they use. Enough with the conditioners, sprays, and cream already; that shit makes my eyes water. What the hell is conditioner anyway? 

3. Stick up for you, but still respects your independence. 
Translation: bail you out when you fail at life, but never bring it up during conversations. 

4. Give you the remote control during the game. 
This one is inherently stupid because it implies that all guys like to watch ""the game."" Since I'd rather be shot in the chest with projectile diarrhea than watch ""the game,"" I'll assume the author meant something worthy of watching, such as Ren & Stimpy, in which case you need to put the bitch down if she touches your remote. 

5. Come up behind you and put his arms around you. 
LAME. Who has time for this? Sounds like something out of a herpes commercial where some lady is rock climbing or doing something else which symbolizes her independence, then out of nowhere she blurts out ""I HAVE HERPES."" The music gets all serious and you hear a voice over ""...there is no cure,"" cue inspirational music ""but treatment is available."" Then it cuts to a shot of the bitch on a beach and a guy runs up behind her and puts his arms around her. Good job dumbass, you're dating a skank with herpes. 

6. Play with your hair. 
Again with the hair? Women never play with the hair on my back, why the double standard? 

7. His hands always find yours. 
This is one of those things women read and say ""AWW HOW ROMANTIC."" I have news for you: holding hands is stupid. Women don't know the first thing about being romantic. Only lesbians hold hands anyway; allow me to explain. The only time it's acceptable to hold hands with anyone is if you're at a peace vigil. Guys don't go to peace vigils, period. If you do, you have to surrender your balls and get a sex transplant because you're a bitch; in either case, you're a woman, and when two women hold hands it can only lead to one thing as far as I'm concerned. 

8. Be cute when he really wants something. 
Bullshit. When I want something, I yell. If she can't hear me in the kitchen, sometimes I'll threaten beatings if I'm sober. 

9. Offer you plenty of massages. 
For your boobs maybe. I happen to have the uncanny ability to massage breasts. With my mouth. 

10. Dance with you, even if he feels like a dork. 
Let's face it: there are few things in this world more stupid than dancing. Except break dancing, which pirates and lumber jacks would agree is awesome. Other than that, dancing makes me envy cripples. 

11. React so cutely when you hit him and it actually hurts. 
See, this is what pisses me off about women: they expect special treatment at their discretion. They want equal rights, equal pay, and equal treatment for everything EXCEPT when it comes to shit like this, then they want you to ""react cutely"" instead of, say, putting them in a head lock and making them eat ants and/or spiders while you give them carpet burn. Why don't women react ""cutely"" when men hit them for a change? Oops, I forgot, that's domestic abuse. 

12. Drive 5 hours just to see you for 1. 
Any guy who would drive five hours just to see a chick for one is an asshole. If every guy drove around for five hours just to spend one with their girlfriend, we'd fill up the air with so much pollution that we'd all choke on the exhaust, get cancer, and then bake under the sun while our lungs rupture and we slowly die from internal bleeding. 

13. Stare at you. 
You stupid attention seeking whore, just buy the bitch a mirror, because apparently she thinks that you don't have anything better to do than to sit around and stare at her. If women ran the world, we'd still be searching for the wheel. 

14. Call for no reason. 
Oops, this one belongs on the list of ""Twenty-six things women do that piss men off because they need to fill their otherwise vapid lives with something to make them feel like they have a purpose for existing as they eventually realize that they're pissing their youth away on stupid bullshit like fashion trends."" 

I can't go on, I'm going to go do something less painful like stick my dick in the oven."

"event","I quote that from dan greene, whom I love by the way becuase he always listens to me, and we always have good talks.
So yeah last night... Melissa came over and then Fil, Matt, Sean, Tim, and Mike stopped by.  It was fun to hang out with them even though they were screwing around online and causing so much trouble... but it wasnt fun when they called brennan becuase now he hates me, and thinks Im gay probably.  But I didnt tell them to call... and I didnt want them to, so I just wish he would believe me. Oh well, as much as I don't want to, if I keep screwing up Im just going to forget it becuase I shouldn't have to keep calling becuase he hangs up on me... and I hate that... I hate that i care so much, and I wish I could just make evrything better, or just make it go away becuase this totally sucks.
So hopefully Melissa will stop by or something so we can talk... and then Im going to my grnadmas and ugh... this is so not the way I wanted evrything to turn out.  This was supposed to be my fun day home alone. But now its not."

But Leah came over last night which was hot, we talked and that was AWESOME... lol. She told me of her adventures with Alex... and I didnt tell her mine becuase oh thats right I have none becuase some people have to be gay and ruin things... uh... so yeah... anyways, and we played scattergories and there were some awesome times right there, like when I thought a scarecrow was a bird, and when Leah could only think of Missy Elliot when naming an athlete.... oh boyy... hanging out with my best buddy never gets old....
If only I wouldnt waste my time waiting for other people then it would be fine. 
And right now Im arguing with Fil so thats awesome and Im winning."

But I ended up watching the kids until one, so I just went home, which was fine.... and I went home with 40 bucks which was even more fine.  And hopefully I'll  save it for drivers ed, but I doubt it.
So today should be relaxing and fun... and hopefully I'll hit up the h-drome with fil and drag leah or someone with me...

So I think I fell asleep around 11:30 or something, waiting for Chantal and others to call me back.. and I woke up a little after 12 to my phone beeping with a message, of course Chantal... and thats when I discovered that I was going to be sick  :(
So I kept waking up during the middle of the night, coughing and feeling nauseous.. and right now my throat still feels weird and my stomach kind of hurts... but I still hope I can do something today  :)


Yesterday we went up to Massachusets to visit my grandma.. we took her out to church and then shopping... then ate some dinner and stuff.. it was nice, only I knew my mom was dragging it out and being slow purposely so I wouldnt be able to anything and it would be ""too late""... anyways, I was being a good grandaughter and giving my grandma a massage and she was talking about how the other she fell asleep on the rocking chair and she half woke up or something and saw my grandpa in his chair, and he said something to her, and told her to go to bed... and then she also said she could hear him snoring at night... and I was like ooohhh... and it was so sad but really sweet.  And my grama is so cute, and her and grampa used to walk all the time in the am... and her neighbor said he'd walk with her now, and she was telling my mom how people would say things, like ""wow she has a bf already""... I was like omg... hes almost 20 years younger then her. lol. But it was so funny.  
And I also learned that I'm a damn good massage giver, so thats good  ;)"

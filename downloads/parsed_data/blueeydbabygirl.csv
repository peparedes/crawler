<P>You are emotionally reserved and private. You typically keep your cool during arguments and rarely reveal personal information that you later regret. <BR><BR>On the surface, you appear very serene. Inside however, you may sometimes feel detached or disconnected from the world around you. The upside of this is that you are not the sort of person to easily lose your temper. You think about things rationally rather than get swept up in emotions. You also remain calm in the toughest of situations. <BR><BR>Your psyche is very unique; the more you learn about it, the more you will understand who you really are. </P>"

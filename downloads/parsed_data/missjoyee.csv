"event","1) who wouldn't u mind making out with among your friends?

Kevin Miller! haha DUH...

2)if you think your life is hard, what are you comparing it to?

there isn't anything to compare it to because i guess life isn't hard afterall

3) if you're not happy with what you have now, how can u be happier with more?

you can't be happier with more if you're not happy with what you have now... you have to learn to appreciate what you do have first.

4) what if u lost everyone and everything in ur life right now... and then somehow got them back, how would you react or be?

i would appreciate them a lot more.

5) is it always better to be safe than sorry?

nope, not always. sometimes you have to take risks and deal with the consequences in order to learn from experiences.

6) if u had 5 mins to live, who would u call and why are you waiting??

i would call my dad. i am only waiting because i guess we are on bad terms right now... oh and cuz he's in Korea right now. =(

7) is it true u have to see it to believe it, or rather, do u have to believe it before u can see it?

it depends on what it is.

8) what would u attempt if u knew u could not fail?

i would FLY!!!!!

9) in order to find yourself, are you willing to lose yourself?

YES because you have to LOSE yourself in order to FIND yourself. crash and burn...
its the only way to go!

10) WHY BE AFRAID OF SOMETHING YOU WANT?

i'm not anymore.

11) if what's in your dreams wasn't already inside of you, how could u even dream it?

you can't. i believe dreams are manifestations of your subconscious mind heart body and soul. although we may not know why or how they have gotten in our dreams, in some way or another they have a significance to ourselves whether we know it or not. the thing is to figure out what they really mean to us and how it affects us in our concious and subconscious states.

12) DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW FAR MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW??

yeah i know i know that i know.

13) are you making new mistakes or the same old ones?

id like to think i make new ones but sometimes the old ones seem to catch up to me from time to time.

14) how do you want to be remembered?

as my own individual... someone who had her own trials and tribulations to overcome in life. someone who loves to learn from her own and other's mistakes and make something out of it. someone who recognizes there are good and bad sides to things but likes to live life through the postive. someone people can relate to, and trust. someone you can't compare me to!

15) what if you looked for the good in everyone and in every situation?

i already do... despite all the BS and injustice i happen to run into. i try not to let the small things get to me because to me, everything is just small stuff. no matter how much someone or something will try to break me down, they might get to scratch my surface but deep down i have a fortress built up from years of experience unable to shake my foundation. id rather not give in to negativity at all expense. truthfully, there really is good in everyone and in every situation though... if you really think about it. 

16) will you ever know how truly brave you are?

no, i learn something new about myself everyday.

17) how far would you go to chase what you really want?

whatever it takes.

18) what if the rest of your life was the best of your life?

it's already begun... =D

19) are you the type of person with whom you would like to spend the rest of your life?

sure, why not. ill never get bored. i am constantly changing! i truly believe you are your own best friend.

20) if you don't think highly of yourself, then who will?

honestly, nobody will. even if someone did and you didnt, it wouldnt be satisfying for yourself. simply, it all begins with YOU.

21) do you realize that nothing is too good to be true?

its hard to accept but i guess.

22) if you don't have all the things you want, are you grateful for all the things you don't have that you didn't want?

hell fucking yeah.

23) what difference does it make if the thing you're scared of is real or not?

there is no difference.

24) when will you ever have more time than you do right now?

umm... 

25) what are 5 things you value most in life?

God, my family, education, my friends, my health

26) what is the ONE thing you think of that always makes you smile?

funny memories.

27) can you really be brave if you've only had wonderful things happen to you? 

nope."

""Have patience with everything that is unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms on books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, some day far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer."" --Rainer Maria Rilke"

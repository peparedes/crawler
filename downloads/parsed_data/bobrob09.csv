"event","When a person reaches a point in there life where they can no longer begin to understand all that has gone on, something must change.  The last several months have been torturous to me.  Not a day has gone by when i havent felt sick, and not a day has gone by when I haven't thought about my life.  

Let me be the first to say that I am not proud of my life, and the actions that belong to it.  To explain them would take more time than I have here or that of which i am willing to dedicate to this entry.  

For all of the lies which I have told.  I am sorry.  If you read this, and you know who you are, know that I have always wanted to tell you.  That everyday I saw you made it that much harder to not do so.  Know that I am so sorry, and that if you never want to speak to me again, I accept it, and that I hope you do well.  You are my best friend, and these couple of days have been unbearable---and i completely deserve this.  Do not think for a moment that I have not learned from all of this--I have-but that does not make her hurt dissapear-and I don't think there is anything short of killing myself that ever would.  I know longer know what to do--and I haven't for quite a long time.  But I know that I want to do good-just what that entails I am not sure.  I knew that I could not lie to you anylonger--but I had no idea on how to talk to you.  Hear me, I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart for the way in whcih i told you-how was I to face you-a person who had trusted and been such a good friend?  I found it impossible.  I am a coward, and for the first time in a long time-I acted agaisnt that by talking to you. 

I don't know what else to say.  I am here."

A couple games into it a stipulation was thrown in: the loser had to do 25 pushups.

""Show me a sane man and I will cure him for you.""

"event","Well, Matts still here in Bmore---and after running pointless errands around for the greater part of the day, there are several things which I came to realize.  One, banks are a pain in the ass.  For something as simple as getting a checking account number on a piece of official letter head, you have to wait in line, sit around, talk to an associate, then wait in line again, only to be helped.  Second, Geico is not the only way one can save on their car insurance.  Somehow, my car insurance has dipped by about $500 a year!  Finally, if you're told not to be late to work an hour before your shift starts, nyou should not be late.  I did it, got yelled at, and had to mop the floor.  Twice.  

But, work was a breeze.  It went by...somewhat slowly ( I never said it was a fast breeze) because tonight was not busy.  At all.  Anywho, around 7ish Pat and Matt came in, and got some dessert (which gave me the rare opportunity to sit down at work).  That was cool.  The last several hours ended without a high note, at which point I came home, driving the longest possible route because I really wanted to listen to some Josh Turner.  Good Stuff.

I walked in the door to find out that Pat finally has learned how to use the CD burner...if only Matt could also show me how to do that.  I took a very quick shower, and decided to go for a drive.

Matt needs a cord for his phone.  So naturally, he talked me into driving to the local walmart.  We got there, and guess what. Closed.  So, we decided to get on the highway and go find another walmart, because as everybody knows, if you look hard enough, or just if you look, one can always find a walmart.  We got there, in Glenburnie, it was closed.  So, since it was a nice night, we decided to take the long way back.  We went the back way on Route 1, and went through Brooklyn, and then Patapsco.  Somehow, we got lost in Patapso.  After being lost there, around 12:30 AM, we managed to find the belt way, and we started heading to DC.  

Shit, I had a half tank of gas, and I figured what the hell, I havent just taken a ride for a ride's sake in a very long time.  So it was Matt and me against the open road.  Half way to DC, we decided, heck, we know the capital to well, and we took the second upcoming exit.  We wound up in Laurel.  Neither one of us had been there before, so we decided to check things out.  After driving down Main Street (very original!) we saw the sign Open for a book store!  After driving past it several times, we decided to go take a look.  We parked, and while walking towards the book store, I thought just how great it would be to grab a burger.  Too late for anything like that I thought.  Well hell no. Across the street, was a classic 1950s burger joint.  We had to go, and we did.  It was cool, we got to talk to some random dude, who go figure, was from Frederick. We heard about his life story pretty much, and got some mini burgers for about seven bucks.  Not too shabby.

Well, back to the story.  We then left, and started walking to this bookstore.  I really couldn't wait to pick up some sort of used book, I mean come on what type of bookstore is open at 1 AM.  Well, we soon found out.  We opened the door, walked in, and quickly walked right back out.  It was a Porn/Book store. No no no.  We left quickly, got back in my car, and decided we'd had enough of Laurel.

We left Laurel, and got on the highway.  The highway felt good to be good on again.  Too good.  I realized I was going about 85 mph and that I passed a state trooper.  Realizing he got off the shoulder, and was prob going to give me a ticket, I quickly took the first exit off, and then the first exit off the smaller road.  
No ticket, but at the same time, a ticket to being lost.  and where did we wind up?  On Coca Cola Drive.  Has anybody ever heard of that?  Well it was okay, we were thirsty.  But after driving around we soon found out that the road did not have any vending machines.

Pity.

We got back on the belt way, and after passing and flipping off Scaggsville (which may or may not have pissed off the driver behind us) we headed back home.  

And now, our cool stoy has ended.

Gnight."

My best friend, Carroll, got to come see the apartment the other night, and that was very cool.  Today, we woke up, and all drove back to Baltimore, where we got to eat some lunch at Applebee's.  After that, Matt and I came back to my house.  

Where I was supposed to actually go to work tonight, somehow the God's of Fate steered me in a completely different direction.  A good friend of mine, Senator George Della asked if I would come out and help him with his campaign.  So, I got off work, and Matt and I got to go door knocking all throughout South Baltimore.  It was the most fun that I have had in quite some time.

I am telling you, that theme park is awesome, and so far, I believe that I have more than gottne my money's worth out of the $66 it cost to have the season pass.  Geoff came with me and Matt, and we met Jess there, so it was the four of us walking around the park and getting on rides all day.

If there was a rollercoaster, we got on it.  In fact, at one point, my arms were up, and we hit a turn, and somehow I managed to hit Jess in the eye.  Sorry, hope that didn't hurt too much.  

The rest of the day was cool, and then we discovered the...um...water cone?  if you want details, please feel free to ask.  Just know for now that the ride was soooooo cool, that all of us wound up getting on it about 12 times.

"event","Well after several long days of being away from LJ-alas I have returned at the turn of the tide!  THe last couple of days have been full of things either directly or indirectly related to moving.  Finally, after many long hours and two days worth of labor the apartment is full!  Disorganized, but full.  First of all, many thanks to those who came out and helped.  SPecial thanks go to Geoff-(we could not have carried that killer sofa without you!)  

Additionally, in the last couple of days I have come to realize some things, and I feel that it is my duty to share them with you, my audience.  First of all, moving is a bitch.  Things seem to never want to work, and if there is a way things can go wrong, they do  aka Murphy's law.  But as hard as things may be, there is always something that will still surprise in a positive manner.  Look as most of you know, last year for me was quite rough, one from which I am still recovering.  AS painful of a year as it may have been, each day I feel just a little bit stronger, and a little bit more sure of myself.  Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.  Without my family, and without you, my friends, I could not be where I am today.  Matt, you have truly become a great friend, and I don't think that I can or will ever be able to say thanks.  (So...Thanks)  

Now, I stand on the edge, ready to move on, but still hurt from the past.  Yesterday I came across some photos that made me go lie down and cry.  I am still not over her.

I want to move on---though I am not ready.  I want to try and experience new things, but my heart aches nostaglicly (did I spell tht correctly?)  I guess my ranting has and must come to an end-so I will leave you with this thought:

The person who waits for things to come his or her way misses out on the fullness of life. 

The person who misses out on what life has to offer, is the one who waits when he should act."

"event","Okay, so whats new with me?  Um, not much.  Thursday I had my first day off!!!! It was truly a blessing because I feel like I had been working myself to death.  Wednesday night, after working the whole day, I went and got Matt from his house, and then that damn episode at the Commuter Lounge happened.  No biggie.  The next day, we officially signed the papers on the apartment!!! and then to celebrate-I decided a trip to Six Flags was in order.

We got Erin, drove to six flags, only to experience a serious headache on the way in (please ask this one's funny lol).  The day was awesome-I swear we rode every single ride there was to ride.  BTW-the three of us are now season pass holders-and we most likely will be goin often bcuz the memberships expire in September, and we must get our money's worth!

Friday was pretty cool-somehow again I wound up having off-which was good bcuz I felt like i could still use another day of rest.  After a failed attempt at trying to get Matt to Penn Station, it was decided best if he just stayed another day in Bmore.  We went and hung out with my friends tim carroll and joe-and all is well with the world-

This morning I woke up late, had to rush matt to Penn Station (thank god there was no traffic), and get to work.  I am now breaking, but alas, soon I must return to that thing called work.

I'll be back later."

"event","I finally managed to get some much needed sleep in the commuter lounge when lo and behold I was woke up by a security guard around 4 Am telling me that we shouldnt be sleeping here.  No worries, we didnt listen.  Around 6 these guys tried this again, and uh yeah no.  I kept sleeping, and Matt hid me with pillows so that people couldnt see me asleep.  Haha, damn the man and save the empire."

"event","So, I am sitting here typing away at 2:30 in the morn and I have come to accept the fact that yes, I may be an insomniac.  Thank you matt.  Um, tomorrow matt and I are officially signing papers for our apartment! Sweet.  Sadly, we have to wake up early to do this.  WTF?  

I know its been a while since I've been able to post regularly and for that I apologize, and I assure you that things are nearly back on track with my damn pc.  But anywho, let me pose a question:

How do you know if youre missing out on something great?

Please give me your ideas on this, I can always use you advice.

Sleep time? No, its time for some Jolt.  

Yay."

"event","The last day or so my internet has been down, and therefore I apologize for not having updated it lately.  Yesterday was a boring day at work, nothing too unusual.  So fast forward.

I still have been needing my keys.  After working another double yesterday because somebody came in to work so sick she could barely stand, I decided that it was way overdue to go see my friends.  I got to Carroll's house, and hung out there for a little bit.  After talking with him and his family, and after having my first ever cosmopolitan (and several others too) I went and had a tipsy sleep (which was good).  I woke up, drove to frederick, and yay! got my keys.  I also found out that I made the Dean's List.  Sweet.

There will be more info coming lol.  night
summing up: i got my keys, and I had off work tonight (if you want to know why, all you have to do is ask)"

"event","Well guys--the day started with a bang, literally.  I was supposed to be at work at 8 Am.  Nope.  Didnt happen.  The alarm which I had thought had been set for 730 never really got set.  Around 8:20, I jump out of bed, hit my head on the wall, fall back in bed, and wonder what the fuck had just happened.  I looked at the clock, cussed, woke my mom up, and the race was off to get to work.  I ran to the car intime to realize I had left my car keys in the house.  This was the day from hell.

I finally made it to work around 9:15, and luckily for me my manager was very understanding.  She even bought me breakfast. 

I worked at the Canton location until 4.  It was a pretty uneventful day.  Working with my friends Dale and Melissa has proven to be always interesting (Just ask about the trash can incident).  After that I was off to Little Italy to start me next shift. 


Busings tables was hard, it seems so many damn people just want to eat Italian desserts.  Where did all these fat people come from? It confuses me.  Anywho, after 7 hrs of that job, I stumbled to my car, drove slowly home, and wound up here, typing away.  

I get to sleep in and I cant wait.  Infact, I said it perfectly, I cant wait.

Goodnight."

"event","Work sucked.  It seemed like it was never going to end.  Here I am, sitting here typing away when i should be sleeping.  But alas I am not.  I did pretty well on tips, but it seems half of them are going to have to fill my gas tank.  Does anybody else think its time to seriously consider a hybrid vehicle?

I get to sleep for the next 6 hrs, then its back to work for me.  Tomorrow is the last double that I get to pull for a while, so that will give me a chance to catch my collective breath a little bit.  
I would stay a lil bit longer and write some more things, but my damn pillow looks to good.  

Goodnight."

"event","Well today started off pretty much the same way yesterday ended.  Yesterday, after going to Hood to take my last postponed final, and after being unable to get Matt to Shady Grove, I came back to Baltimore with him in tow.  However, after several failed ideas about how to get him back to FallsChurch, it was time to work.  Luckily I got in touch with good old Ben, who was more than willing to let Matt chill him for a lil bit-so everything ok?  Well, no.  After working 9 hrs, I had to drive somewhere to Chase, Maryland, get lost, get more lost, and then somehow find matt walking on the side of the road.  Okay. I had the perfect solution to all of my problems.  Right then at 2:14 in the morning, I saw the most beautiful thing of all time: an open Dunkin Donuts (i was so hungry!)  We stopped in, ate some foodage, and then proceeded to drive back to baltimore.

We got back to Baltimore, and the fact that I had forgotten my keys in Frederick really came back to bite me in the ass-I had no way of getting inside my house at 3 AM without pissing my mom off. Shit. I somehow manage to get my sis to let us stay at her house- (3:30 AM by this point) only to have to wake up by 7 AM-so I could somehow figure a way out to get Matt back home.  Luckily the AMTrak was able to make this happen-so Matt is now home I suppose.  I, however, was 45 mins late to work (which my boss reminded me about all day long).  I'm now at home after working all day and its 5 oclock somewhere lol-but alas-i must return to work in a little under an hour-for another six hour shift.  Is this worth it?  What's more important, my sleep or this money?  Im beginning to lean towards the sleepage.  

Gotta go"

"event","For years now everybody I know has been trying to get me to get this thing called live journal.  Well congratulations Matt Zuhl, you have finally succeeded where numerous others have failed.  It's kind of late and I have this thing called a test tomorrow, so I will try to be brief.  A lot of things have been going on in my life recently, and I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you to all of my friends who have been with me one hundred percent of the way.  I love you all."

"event","A sound like a ghost howling inside a reverb-tank breaks free, and today it is still real.  My heart races in spite of the cup of coffee which sits undrunken and the drugs that sit undone.  The physical waves of emotion are stunning, stupefying, free entirely from the mark of nostalgia.  This record is now, this connection euphoric, this moment I'm lost in something more than a memory.

And to someone else, it's already the long sad shadow of another time.  And to someone else, it's nothing at all.  Ethereal, free-roaming messages.  The world at that window looks bluer than white. The air coming in is cold (and now so is my coffee) but it smells of waxing life. And I can feel myself returning with the winds as they settle down to breezes."

"event","I listened to Crimpshrine this morning.  The last time I'd really heard those songs was on a Measure tour, and long enough ago that I don't remember which one.  I greeted songs that once were the world to me and I felt the distance in time.  The morning was almost ruined with the stink of nostalgia when ""Living in the Past"" came on, and while the faces the lyrics called to mind were, for the most part, not the same one's conjured when I was 19, the feeling was exactly the same.  I seem to get used to changes, but never to change."

     ""They did not awaken quickly, nor fling about nor shock their systems with any sudden movement.  No, thay arose from their slumber as gently as a soap bubble floats out from its pipe.  Down into the gulch they trudge, still only half awake.  Gradually their wills coagulated.  They built a fire and boiled some tea and drank it from the fruit jars, and at last they settled in the sun on the front porch.  The flamin flies made haloes about their heads.  Life took shape about them, the shape of yesterday and of tomorrow.""

it was louis the 14th syle and upholsered in blue velvet
it was the most god awful uncomfortable thing i'd ever planted my ass on, and pj used to sleep on it, even after we moved it to the kitchen... of course, pj's also been know to frequently fall asleep on kitchen floors waiting for coffee to brew, addiction may be a disease, but, atleast in this case it's a funny one... like scurvy, or the clap

the junkies who slept on the floor wheren't as funny, but i don't think this stories about them... there was a girl upstairs, who was addicted to a boy, who was addicted to hard liquor by the liter, and i was addicted to her... but i don't think this stories about any of that either... i think i meant to talk about the house itself... like most houses in new brunsick it had been broken up into little apartments, and ours, atleast on the surface, was exactly what you'd expect... we had an ashtray and a radio in every room, we had three t.v.'s in the living room and not a single one of them had cable, whe had a pair of rabbit ears on one of them, but the only time we ever used it was to try and whatch the ball drop through all the static a week after we moved in... we sang old lang sai or however it's spelled, though nobody knew the words, and most of us where fudging the melody... come to think of it, we went upstairs to do that, all our tv's ever got was snow...

i'd like to think despite the short time we spent there (the six months encomassing a grueling winter and unredeeming spring) we made up for it in pure volume of drugs and alcohol consumed, minors corrupted, neigbors disturbed, guns pulled on our guests by afformentioned disturbed neighbors, parties thrown, video games conquered, and bad movies watched...

the backyard was this junkpile, just shit cluttered everywhere, car parts, hunks of concrete, a steel drum (of the hobo peruasion as opposed to the rasta kind)... at our first or second party j puked from too much mad dog and it covered the whole step in purple ice, 18% by volume... as the months went on it got more cluttered with trash and shit, because we never figured out the garbage schedule, we'd just throw it in the back yard and once in a while the cokehead who lived upstars would tell us when to put it out...

the inside wasn't much better, we we're supposed to have a dishwasher but it never worked so we would just let the dishes pile up and when we ran out just kep washing and reusing the ones on the top... all we needed was one pot, and one frying pan, we lived of of perogies, saffron rice, powdered ice tea, coffee, and peanut butter... sometimes pj'd bring leftovers from his uncle resturant, sometimes i'd loot my parent's house for cheese... bagel bites were our caviar, mountain dew was my dom periogn, spelling has never been my strong point...

i was drunk for a week strait... which is a pretty pittiful binge all things considered, but i gave it the old college try...

ever seen the star wars holiday special? worst thing i've ever lost sleep for, and i mean that... well, maybe the original x-men pilot with the australian wolverine

watching edge of quarrel and drinking 151, connor and j spooning later that night, the first time i did adderol, the scar on my nose because you shouldn't play with swords while drinking, the fact that i was the second person to make that mistake within a month, the fact that it took an hour for the blood to clot and once it did i was drunk after one drink... i suppose i could sum the whole thing, the good parts anyway, into three images: having almost a dozen people over watching the batman&superman animated movie while passing around a bottle of soco; a handful of us after the first match and moth show, already good and drunk in the junkpile backyard passing around a bottle of malibou since we'd drank every last drop of anything else in the house; and of course, pj passed out on the kitchen floor waiting for that god damn coffee machine"

i was drunk, drinking pabst, the descendents where on the stereo, and somehow there was a beautiful girl here, with me, also getting drunk... the odds of my not sleeping alone that night were the best they'd been in months, everyone in the basement was shouting

it'd been a good night, and it was steadily improving... her scarf was real long and it kept draggin on the floor, the keg was tapped and we sat in the corner, inching closer and closer as we (i) drunkenly slid down the wall, heels digging in the dirt floor propping myself up, and she leaned in and i leaned in, and she pulled back...

""i wouldn't want you to do something just cause you're drunk""

i looked at her, i looked at my beer cup, i looked back at her and grinned

""i got this drunk just to get the nerve to do this at all""

we kissed, we ate fallafel, we passed out awkwardly on a small couch, it was a good night, 'cause nothing says romantic like adolescent hardcore and cheap beer"

Subject: and this is all we know  
Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2003 03:51:22 -0500  
   
from those first nights really talking in that spring two years ago, i've loved you, i've felt some connection with you that i could hardly compare to anything else, and comparisons don't do any feelings justice... it's 3:25 in the morning, i can't sleep, after too many cigarettes, noise, crowded basements, i still end up in the quiet, and i can't do anything but think about you... i do miss you, i miss lying next to you, not even touching, just knowing you were there... i miss the hope i had, the idea that two people could eventually connect, feel everything for one another, be everything to one another, the idea that love was something as simple as two people finding happiness in being together, i lost all that on you... the idea that love can be so skewed and one sided, it was to much for my fragile hope to bear 

i trail off, i don't even know why i'm writing this, i'm a stubborn man, and an angry one... i don't think this can be salvaged, even if it can, i wouldn't know where to start, how to begin... it's to big to think about, to intimidating to even try... failure marks my life only because i don't know how to face anything at all, or never bother to attempt simply out of fear of failure... it doesn't matter, call it a flaw, call it what little defense i have, i was ready to lay down all my walls, i was willing to give everything i am and everything i have, to share my life with you, if you're wanting now for something we had, it's unfortunate, because you threw the idea of us away, i'm just closing the door on something that was already lost and left unfinished... 

because i learned early on that hope was a lie, it just took me until now to beleive it 

love 
mike

"event","sure, i'll say i'm wiping the slate clean, i've got goals, i've got hopes, moments of clarity are easy when you decide not to drop to the bottom of a bottle, clenching my teeth looking for a little peace, the night crashing over me like waves, and i should hate the sea by now, and i'm so fucking selfish, and when i stop complaining sometimes i see how fucking lucky i am, throwing fortune into the fire for the sake of having a song to sing

no more wishing, copper is copper, stars are fires too far off to keep us warm, walking aways was always the easiest choice to make, tonight though, i think it's the right one too, the path of most resistance doesn't always bring us anywhere better, and how many hard road stories can i fit into 45 second bursts?

in this clearing, on the cusp of everything, where is this taking me, where am i taking myself, words wont hold an edge, it's to thin, the angles poorly judge, i'm wasting time between anger and sleep, a fury in my belly, how much time can i waste? clenching my teeth looking for peace, how much time can i waste?"

"event","so maybe when the cd changed and the first few notes of the magnificent seven came through i stopped and thought about you

so maybe for just a second the resentment fell aside and i just wondered how you were, what you were doing

so what the fuck do i do now?"

"event","in the movies it's a sudden switch, a kiss, a cry, the heartbroken hero's fumbling speach, all at once everything we understand thus far changes, lies i've fed myself since childhood... doubly cursed with an inability to find the right words and to know when to shut the fuck up, i'm ramble across the diner table like a fool, did it seem like laying guilt? the words came out in the wrong shape again, i don't blame anyone except myself, and maybe fate just a little bit, i wrote this a dozen times over in the car ride home, speeding, shaky hands...

in the movies it's a bottle that takes this away, but there's nothing but a bad migraine in the bottle, and the little white pills have the last of been vanished, to numbing and trying to reason, and tonights sleep gets cast aside to green eyes and wishes, comic book 5am, more childhood lies, lies about heroes, lies about fate.....

lies i can't help but lose myslef in...

i'm sorry"

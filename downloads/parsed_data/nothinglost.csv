If your reading this
Then I finally did it
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye
There was no time
Understand I was stressed 
Living day to day was hard
And I gave it my best
But there was nothing left
For me in this world
To convince me to stay
Now I'm long gone away
Don't you do that
Don't you start your tears
Just remember all the time we spent over the years
Never cried
Never think bad to me
What's done is done and that's the way it had to be
I need you to be strong for me
Say your prayer everyday in my memory
I'm sure it's helping me
To earn my feathers 
To get some wings
And a halo and a harp and angelic things
And even though I'm gone And outta sight
Never worry about me
I'm alright 

Chorus
And if you should die don't blame yourself and keep it locked inside
(I'm alright)
And every time you cry don't break down just keep me inside of ya mind
(I'm alright)
And if you should die don't blame yourself and keep it locked inside
(I'm alright)
And every time you cry don't break down just keep me inside of ya mind
(I'm alright)

You only saw the outside
Never knew what I was feeling
Now everyday you lay in bed staring at the ceiling(I'm alive)
But you don't see me no more
You can fill your heart with memories 
And thanks from before (I'm not an angel)
But everybody got a purpose in life
To survive when the sunrise
You gonna live to see another day
Just don't follow me and live your life your own way
I'll be in set and if you forget 
Get the picture with the cord around my neck(can you handle that)
Can you handle that?
See me underground and I'm stuck
But it's cool that's where I wanna be
Keep the drama in hand but outta sight
And know that
I'mma be alright 

And if you should die don't blame yourself and keep it locked inside
(I'm alright)
And every time you cry don't break down just keep me inside of ya mind
(I'm alright)
And if you should die don't blame yourself and keep it locked inside
(I'm alright)
And every time you cry don't break down just keep me inside of ya mind
(I'm alright)"

"event","In every breakup there are stages that a person goes through. The main one involves the fact that your pissed at the person and your going to talk as much shit about you as they can. Charissa (I normaly called her Diva) His sunk to that level. It just makes the person talking shit seem low. I'm not going to sink to that level. I could, I could talk alot of shit about her, but I'm not going to sink to that level. I won't lower myself just to try to make her look bad. I find it funny because people do this to try to hurt the other person. Well I'm sorry Charissa, but nothing you can say about me is going to hurt me. It takes alot to hurt a person with no self-esteam. Anything you can say about me has already been said, or thought by me. So I wish you the best of luck with that one. I'm happy that you've moved on with your life. I know I moved on rather quickly. It's only because I thought we were done and over with when you told me we needed time apart. I guess I should have asked huh? 

 Life has been good besides a bit of deprestion. I've been hanging out with all of my friends again and it's been lovely. I enjoy the company of many people, and I've made alot of new friends to. It's always nice once you've been with someone who has tried to change you to be able to go back to your old self and feel comfortable again. It's taken me a little while to get back into being able to say what ever comes to my mind again, but it's slowly comming along.

We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained we must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature.

 Wednesday diva moved to Co. I don't know when the next time I'm going to see her is, or if It's ever going to happen. I'll admit that I'm more depressed about it then I let on, but it keeps me sane. I haven't heard from her yet to even know if she's safe or not. I'm sure she is, but I still worrie about her. I hope she has a better life down there.

 I got a new pet. I got a bunny rabbit. I named her Thumper. She is sooo cute and cuddely. She's really smart for a bunny and actualy listens to me. I got her from a friend who couldn't take care of her anymore. I figured since she was an outside bunny anyway that it would be fine. I got the hutch for her and everything.
 
 That's about it really not alot new life is back to it's normal boring self again for awhile. Quote time!!!

Very, very simple, very truly. You are the epitome of everything I have ever looked for in another human being. I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't, I can't look into your eyes without feeling that, that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are.I've never felt this way before, and I don't care. I like who I am because of it. Diva, there isn't another soul on this fucking planet who has ever made me half the person I am when I'm with you. Please know that I'm forever changed because of who you are and what you've meant to me.

"event","So it's been a rocky past few days. Diva, has made the choice that we need some time apart. We're not broken up, but we're taking some space for some personal time. We both have things we need to work on. It's been hard, because I miss spending so much time with her, but I guess we need it. I've been home since 11 and I haven't been able to sleep, I have to much on my mind. I know one things for sure. It's time to tuck away my childish side and let the mature side of my rule. Not just for Diva and Me, but for myself. It's something that needs to be done. It's not going to be an overnight process, but it's one that needs to be done. I want to prove to Diva, that I'm not as immature as I appear to be most of the time. After having a long talk with a friend tonight, I realised that my childness/immaturity is a defence that I put up, becasue it makes me liked by my group of friends because most of them are the same way, well guess what, I'm not my friends. I don't need to do that, if they don't like me for who I am, then thats fine. Why do I put up that defence around Diva? I don't know, I have no reason to. So it's time to drop it. To quote 1 Corinthians 13:11 ""When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."" I want you to know Diva, this isn't just for you it's for me to. I don't want you to feel like I'm holding you back, I don't want you to feel like your my babysitter, I never asked you to do that. Yes I'm younger then anyone that you've dated, but that does not mean that you have to be my babysitter. I love you and I want us to work out, and it will. It's going to take time for both of us to work out our problems, but I know that we can lean on each other when we need help, or at least I hope we can.
Just a tought on meeting Diva I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss from her mouth, one touch of her hand, than eternity without it. One."

your blanket wraped around me
your pillow pulled close to my body
as the first hints of blue from the oncomming dawn sneek into my room
I think about the past month and a half that I have spent with you
I think about the fears that we are still working on
I think about if you really trust me
I wounder if you know that I'm not like the rest of the guys you dated
I'm not going to cheat on you, I expect the same from you
I'm not going to lie to you, I expect the same from you

I pull the pillow tighter and long for the feel of your body next to mine
the way we fit so well together when we snuggle up sometime before dawn
the way that I feel compleat when I'm holding you
the way you make my urge go away
the way you smile at me even if I am doing something stupid

You tell me that you had to grow up fast and didn't have much of a childhood
that I shouldn't be as immature as I am at times, and I know you think that i don't listen, but I do,
but you also have to understand, that just because you didn't have much of a childhood dosen't mean that you can't have fun now.

I love you baby, and I always will. I can't wait untill you get back and I get to hold you in my arms.."

"event","So tonight was an alone night with out Diva, I went out, because I has a job interview at Bullwackers, went to the legion for a bit, they closed early so we all went down to Red Door for awhile, it was fun, i sang Closer and has girls out grinding on each other it was fun. But I couldn't help but feel like something was missing without Diva there. I felt guilty because I was out having fun without her, but she was with momma and friends sure I'm sure she's been having fun.
 The last two days between us have been odd, and I don't know why. She seems distant, I know she's not feeling good, but it seems like she dosen't want anything to do with me. Dosen't even want to cuddle or hug, I don't know whats going on. At times I feel like she's slipping away from me, I don't know why. I know that I annoy her sometimes, but when your with someone all the time it's bound to happen isn't it? It's something that is going to happen from time to time. This afternoon i was feeling down about all of this and wanted nothing more then to snuggle with her, but she went and slept in her moms room, I'm sure if I would have asked her it would have been diffrent, but she was out before i could, and I hate to wake her up. So i went into her room and cryed by myself. Well thats about all for now, I'm going to try to get some sleep, the sooner I sleep the sooner she'll be back here, I hope."

"event","There hasn't been alot going on, just hanging out with Diva, watching movies and what not. Things have been going really well, we have our little  spats, but normaly we're just playing. After my last post we had a nice long talk, about her not leaving me ect, but I still wounder sometimes why she's with me. She could have any guy she wanted, any, but she picked me, and is staying with me, regarless of her not wanted a realtionship when she meet me. Regardless of her still being in love with Tony. Regardless of my frist fear that I had before we even started making love. She still stays with me. I don't know why. In time all of this will pass and life with be fine, it's just going to take some time.
 She feels bad because she can't give all of herself to me, becasue she still loves Tony, and because of her medical problems. I'm fine with that, to an extent. I'm can live without making love to her, we have plenty of time for that. But the part that kind of bothers me is her still being in love with Tony. I know I don't have to worrie about her going back to him, thats not the issue. But when she tells me she loves me, it makes me wounder if she's just going through the motions, and doing it for me, or if she really does love me. Can she loved both me and Tony at the same time? I know this is just a fear and probly not true, so I'm not going to let it bother me anymore. It's silly because I know she loves me."

"event","So to fill you in on my last post. Diva commented today that, not to me but in general that she didn't know if she wanted to get married because thats it, it's final until you get a divorce. If she wants her freedom, wants to date other people, then I guess she does. I guess I'm not what she wants. I already know that I'm not her normal type, knowing that it just makes me feel like I have to try 10 times harder to make her happy, to show her that I love her. I guess I'm not doing that, or something, because tonight on the way home from hot tubing with Spyder and Rain she told me that the comments she's been making are what I see as a defense. She told me that they to push me away. I told her, they aren't working because I'm still here, and I'm not going any place, because I truly do love her. Then we got on to the fact that she's still not over Tony. The last guy she she was going to marry. Well I can't compete with that either. Why? Because besides him lying to her, he is everything she wants. I finally got over Falacie Because of her. Because she treats me like a person. I guess I'm, just not doing that for her. If she wants space from me wants time to think about things then she can have it. I'm more then willing to wait for her. I just want her to know that I love her with every thing that I am, and I'm willing to wait until she gets over Tony, or something, I don't know anymore. I have an urge to cut sooo bad, it would be easy tonight everyone is sleeping now, but I won't. Not Because I don't want to, but because she dosen't need to deal with that. She has enough stuff on her plate right now to be bothered with me, and my stupid way of making myself feel better. Even if I did cut, I'd wake her up and tell her right away. But like I said I'm not going to do that. I could even pop a bunch of pills, and see what kind of cocktail I could come up with, see if I can find one that will help me sleep, but I won't do that either. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know if I'm going to lose her or not. I'll keep everyone updated."

I worrie about her when I'm not with her. If she's okay, if she's going to wake up from a bad dream and need someone to hold her. I miss her, like I've never missed anyone before. I know it's going to be 1 this afternoon before I get to see her, and it's eating at me. I know why I asked her to be my wife. I can't see my life without her in it. I can't see spending time alone. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. I has jsut gotten used to sleeping alone when honey came into my life, and now I can't do it again. I don't want to. I want to snuggle with her. I know i sound sad but it's true.
 Anyway It was an okay night minus the fact that Diva wasn't there. I love you Honey and I always will."

 The other day we had somewhat of our first fight, It was my fault, but things have gotten fixed. I was so affraid that I was going to lose her. I know it's something that I won't be doing again. Just the though of not having her in my life was crushing. There is nothing I've ever wanted more then to be with her, for the rest of my life.

 I had urges yesterday durring our fight, urges to cut, but I didn't for myself, and for her. I think I'm finaly getting over it. I don't need it to make me feel better, I don't need it to feel better, thats what I have Diva to do that for me. I love you baby girl now, always and forever."

Untill Dvia agreed to go to a movie with me. Since then time has just flew past. I now wear a ring around my finger. I now have found my soul mate. It's taken 22 years, and a few bad a realtionships for it to happen, but I have. Nothing feels better then spending every hour of every day with her. Sure there are times when I want alone time, but that passes and I'm fine again. She's finaly starting to open up and be more of herself around me. She's not affraid to show me all of her sides. In the month that we've been together we've only made love twice. Each time we amazing. I've never been with a better lover then her. There is just something about the way we fit together. Spyder, Rain you think 11 times is bad. Try getting turned on almost all day, then not getting any at all, for weeks. Do I mind? No. Why? Because it's just going to make the next time that much better.
 I keep thinking about our future, and I smile. I can see myself with her forever. Growing old with her. Having a family with her. Ect. And it makes me smile. She has done so much for me mentaly that I don't know how to thank her. Anyway it's time for her to wake up so I'll say farwell for now."

Diva and I have been together for three weeks, and everything has been wounderful. We haven't fought, we haven't evner came close to it. I'm sure in time we might have some small fights, but thats normal for any realtionship. Yeasterday, I asked mommmy number 3's permistion to marry her daughter. I was basicaly told that I had it before I even asked. Well turnes out that yesterday, Diva was going to ask me why don't we just get married. Funny how her and I think alike all the time. So anyway we went shopping, and she found a ring she liked and she bought it, just a cheep rin from hot topic. So we hang out all day have some fub playing with some toys and what not(Nothing sexual) I gave her a hand/foot massage in the process stealing the ring from her hand. WE went and layed down to get ready for bed. Wehile we laying there snuggled up I asked her to marry me. Needless to say, she said yes. Yes thats right as of lastnight Diva and I are engauged. I told her it dosen't matter when the wedding is, next week, or next year. I'm with her forever. There is no changing that. I have never loved someone so much in my life. I haven never wanted to be with somone so much in my life."

"event","It's been a week almost since I've spent the night in my own bed. It's been almost a week since I've had to wake up alone. Yesterday I took a nap in my own bed, and when I opend my eyes and Honey wasn't there I felt so empty. That is how I feel when I'm not around her. Empty. She has helped me so much, in the two weeks that we've been together. Lastnight, I felt myself slipping into a bit of a deprestion, I don't know why, but I was. Insted of fleeing like I did last time I was around her and I felt it comming on, I stayed and she made it go away without her even know it. We talked alot lastnigh about alot of things. Honey has endometriosis, and she gets really bad cramps. The only way thing that will help if her shots dont is to remove everything. I told her, that if that is what takes care of it, and makes the pain go away, then she needs to get it done. I don't care if she won't be able to have children. As much as I'd love to have a kid, I love Diva more. I'm not with her because of her abilty to have a kid or not, I'm with her because she is such a wounderful, strong, and beautiful girl. We still have alot of talking to do about it, but that will come in time. I'm willing to do what ever it takes to help her get better. She dosen't need to live with this pain.

 I do have to admit, I'm a bit scared. Being this in love this soon into a realtionship. I know some of you think that I'm just in love with the tought of being in love. But my close friends know that I am in love. I do have to admit that it took me almost two years to feel as strongly for Falacie, as I do for Honey now. It's odd, because for the longest time I thought that I would be with Falacie forever, but like i said it was almost a year and a half to two years in the realtionship before that happend. With Honey, I do feel like I could spend forever with her. I've never felt so safe and loved in my life. I know that if I were to lay in her bed and cry she would be there to comfort me, no matter how big or small the problem is. I know that if I was the one with all the pain, she would be doing the same for me, as I am for her. I had an intresting dream lastnight durring one of my little cat naps, but I'm affraid to tell Honey about it. It's not bad, but it's not something that I should be talking to her about two weeks into a realtionship. I know that I can tell her anything, but I don't know.

 With her endometriosis, it makes it hard for us to be intament. But I don't care, I'm not dating her for the sex, I'm with her because I love her. I can wait for sex, if you love someone, you are willing to wait. Besides the longer we don't don't make love the better it's going to be when we finaly do. I'm not the kind of guy that is going to preasure someone into it, it will happen when it happens. I don't want to cause her pain that comes from having sex when you have endometriosis. I don't want to hurt her at all. I'm content with snuggeling up with her, giving her back rubs, and just being there for her. That is better then any sex could ever be."

Have you even been soo totaly in love with someone? That you want to give them the world, and you dno't care how you do it, but you will.Have you ever been so in love withsomeon, that you don't care what your doing, if it's snuggled up just watching TV, not talking, or sleeping in the same bed with them. You don't care what your doing as long as your are with them. We could spend the rest of out lives not talking just snuggled up and I'd be fine with that. But I so enjoy her voice it's so beautiful. When she is at work, i turn her raido station on just to hear her voice.

Everything, us, this, everything just feels so right and so wounderful.

I've never felt more at home at one of my girlfriends houses, or even at one of my friends houses then I do when I'm at her house. So after that we went to my mom's bar to hang out with friends and do some singing. Diva finaly met Rain, and my friend Jen and my daddy. The all really like her. We got Diva a little bit tipsy. She's a riot when she's drunk. While we were there she made us offical again. I still haven't stopped grinning. Also lastnight the three big words were finaly exchanged between us. The grin became a chishier cat grin all night long. So we desided that denny's sounded good. When diva and I got there who should be there, but Falacie. So they finaly got to meet each other. We ate our fries and went home. I won't go into details, because there isn't much to say.
 Diva makes me so happy. I haven't felt this way in a long time, a really long time. When I'm with her, time seems to stop, and fly by all at one. When it's time to leave I don't want to go. I could spend every moment of forever with her, and not be bored. When ever we are together, I never want to leave her, I love just holding her, being close to her. Being in her presence is just amazing. i keep telling her that I'm so lucky to have a beautiful woman like her, she dosen't see it, she says that she is the lucky once. I think we're both lucky. I think we both need each other in our lives. I finaly fond someone that loves me for me, not for what I do for them, not for how much I spoil them but for me. I want this one to last as long as posable, if not forever."

I gave her another body massage. I'd be content just doing that for ever. I love feeling her skin under my fingers, I love being close to her. I remeberd that I had a meeting at work in the morning, so I couldn't spend the night. So I snuggled with her for a little bit, and then left about 3:30. Well needless to say that after I got home and went to try to sleep i couldn't. Not with out her there. Not without feeling her presence in bed with me. Not without her sounds, and her smells. It's sad I know, but it's true.
 I talked to Desta this afternoon, and she told me I was in love. I've never been this into somebody, ever. She said that I seem like a totaly diffrent person. I'm happy, not my normal depressed all the time self. So yeah I'm happy :P

She was tired, so we watched T.V. for awhile, and then I gave her a body massage. I was a gentelman and didn't do anything, even when I was rubbing her thighs. Then we snuggled up and fell asleep. Sometime durring the night I work up and watched her sleep for a few mins. There is nothing more beautiful then watching the one you love while they sleep. It's not like it was a sexual thing, or anything like that. We finly woke up about 12:30 or so, and I came home because I have to work tonight. When I'm awake she is all I tend to think about, she comes before me, and everything else in my life right now. 

Something taken from diva's myspace:
""Is it possible that fairy tales exist? I want someone to sweep me off my feet when Im not expecting it, to walk through the store or park holding hands and he stops to look me in the eyes and kiss my hand, letting me know the door to intimacy is open, a man who doesnt expect sex, but knows the difference of making love, someone who will share their inner most feelings, who is not afraid to be romantic and caring, someone who prays more for the person they love rather than themselves, we spend so much time thinking about ourselves, being selfish and not caring about others, call me silly but i want my knight in shining armor to sweep me off my feet. I know most people say it doesnt exist but I know, that one day it will happen for those who deserve it........ ""

The first night we hung out the thing in the park happed, I do pray for her and think more about her then i do myself.
I love her."

She smiled at me and said ""Someone got laid tonight"" I asked her why she said that and said I was glowing like a christmas tree. I told her no, I didn't get laid, didn't even have the desire to, I just spent four and a half hours with the most amzing girl in the world. She smiled and went back to bed.

I don't claim to know what love is. All i know that this is a missed feeling, a welcomed feeling, and if I'm not in love, then I'm pretty damn close. I haven't felt like this in a long time. I haven't been this happy. I haven't been this comfortable. After she broke up with me, after we were dating three days, I figured it was because she just didn't want to date me, but after spending time with her tonight, I know i was wrong. there is something between us, something that just clicks when we're together. We didn't even go out tonight, I got off work came home took a bath and went to her place snuggled up and watched TV all night long. Did I care? No because I had her in my arms. When I kiss her it's amazing, there is just this feeling that I get. I don't know what words to use to describe it. I didn't want to leave her house tonight, I just wanted to stay and hold her, to be with her. It isn't about sex, not even close. We haven't done anything. I could care less if it does happen. I'd rather snuggle with her. I feel safe in her arms. I bet you are all woundering this this goddess that I'm talking about looks like, well

That is my woundermus goddess that I keep talking about. Isn't she the most beautiful girl that you've ever layed eyes on? I don't know how I got so luck to find someone like her. I have yet to find a flaw in her.  I need some sleep, the sooner I sleep the sooner I get to see her."

"event","w00t w00t! So The forth was bad ass. It was raining diamonds like Shangri-la baby! That was the best part of the night. To explane the blah post. After dating a wounderful girl, for three days, I'm single again. I guess this one wasn't the right one either. It seems me that I always find the one that has feelings for her ex, and can't date me. I'm starting to think it's me, and they are using that as on excuse not to date me. I don't think that is the case this time, because she's not like that, but I'm starting to think that it is me. Maybe I should just stop dating, and live my life alone. It dosen't matter how well I treat a girl, she just seems to have more feeling for someone else ( normaly an Ex) or she just dosen't want to date me because I'm not her type. Well I'm sorry, I'm not going to change for anyone. I'm me, and I'm happy with who I am. So, yeah I guess that in time I might find the right girl, that dosen't have all the baggage from a past boyfriend that she still has feelings for, or dosen't like me because I'm myself. You know I accept everyone for who they are, regardless of size, style, way of life, looks, why can't the rest of the world be that way?
 I was truely happy with Charissa, like i said she made me feel like somebody, like I was worth something.
She is one of the most beautiful girls that I've met in a long time. I told her that all the time. I guess her ex just holds more of her heart then she thought. I'm not going to try to win her heart, there is no compation, she has known him alot longer then I have. Right this second if she were to ask me back out, I would say yes at the drop of a dime, but I know it's not going to happen, and it never will again. The first night I kept asking myself, why would someone as beautiful as her, someone who could have who ever she wanted want to date a nobody like me. I'm not what she normaly dates and I was remminded of that all the time, but it didn't bother me. I figured that maybe she was looking for something diffrent, I guess I was wrong. I hope things work out for her in the future, and if I'm single when she's ready to date someone, then I will galdly go back out with her. I'm not going to wait, even though part of me is telling me to. Part of me is telling me not to let this one go, don't give up, show her that you really do care about her, and that you want her in your life. I really do care about her alot, but I guess the fealing were not returned. I thought things were going good, again I guess I was wrong. I seem to be wrong alot."

"event","So, as of friday night I'm no longer single. I have met the most wounderful girl. After spending time with her, I have come to see that Falacie was right. I wasn't in love with her near the end of the realtionship. There is no way I was, becasue it didn't feel like this. I didn't feel comfortable, and safe in her arms like I do with Charissa. I spent the night snuggled up with her in her bed untill 4:30 this morning, and it was wounderful. I could just spend forever snuggled up with her safe and sound and not have a worrie in the world. She makes me feel like a real person. She makes me feel like I belong. Something my past two girlfriends haven't done. 
 Friday night, when we first kissed, it just felt so right. We were standing by a park, waiting for a friend to show up, and she came over and was snuggeling with me, and it just happend, and nothing has ever felt so right in my life. Her lips are so soft and kissable. I could fall forever into her hazel eyes. They are just beautiful. They match the rest of her. Well I'll keep you all updated on how things go."

I knew I was just a rebound, but now she dosne't want to break up with me because she dosen't want to hurt me, or not be my friend, but she dosen't want to talk about it, so I don't know. I'm breaking up with her when I talk to her later today. Love truely is fleeting, but it's to hard to hold on to I guess. I don't know what I'm going to do now, my life was starting to get better, untill I found out this. It's my luck, but life will go on."

"event","It's been a little while since I've updated, but thats okay most the people that read this know whats going on in my life anyway. But I'm sure there is someone out there that dosen't. I'm single again. It was going to happen anyway. We were just meant to be friends anyway. It was a good breakup, so we're going to stay friends. It's not like she's going to find a boyfriend that is going to hate me. Not only that we wern't together long enough for me to get attached to her I guess. It's going to be hard for me to fall in love with someone again.
 I've been thinking alot lately, about something that really makes me depressed. I wrote about it awhile ago, but I think it was a friends only post. Falacie has had to miscarages One two years ago, and one a year ago. So I would have been the proud daddy of two little ones. I'm sure the first one would have been a boy, I beleive that with everything I am. I've named him Seth. The second, I feel would have been a little girl, and she would have looked alot like her mother. I really haven't given her a name, because I haven't found the perfect name. First of all when I do have kids, and one is a boy, he will not carry the name Seth, I don't care if that is what the mother wants to call him, he will not be named Seth. There isn't a day that dosen't go by that I don't think about what my life would be like if they were still with us. I know Falacie is going to get mad at me for talking about this, but you know what I don't care, they were my children to. I think the reason I've been thinking about them more now is because everyone around me that I've met lately, either has a kid, or is expecting one. I  just wounder what makes them a better perent then I would have been. What makes it that they have cuddle with their little ones at night, and tell them they love them. Like the subject says.. I don't know if I've ever been good enough."

So after the movie I went to the Legion, to hang out with everyone. Had to deal with a drunk Randal and Viper. I got to see Crissy, and Carolyn. But Carolyn and I aren't working out, I guess she wanted to talk about something, but never told me, and then got mad at me for not talking to her. I offerd to take her home so we could talk, but she desided to have Mike take her home, I told her I'd be online to talk to her, i waited for awhile, and she never got online, so I guess she didn't want to talk to bad. So I guess this is either our first fight, or we're not together anymore, and I'm fine with that I guess. I'm sure that it wasn't ment to be. Sure we have alot in common, and I like her, but she is talking about moving with her and everything, and that is moving a little to fast, We've only been together 2 weeks. 2 weeks is not enough time to be thinking about moving to Seatle with someone. I'm going to talk to her today and see what is going on."

There was this 50 year old lady who was a little drunk but she was flirting with me, and I was flirting back being nice. She kissed me at some point in time durring the night, but thats okay I didn't mind it. Carolyn showed up. I don't know why, but things just seemd diffrent lastnight. I told her lastnight that I didn't care where she sat, that she didn't have to sit by me. I also kept running off to hang out with my friends and Carolyn thought that i was ignoring her. I also felt bad because I couldn't be flirty with people. As you all know I'm a very flirty creature. So I'm changinging for someone, and I shouldn't. A good friend of mine pointed that out to me. She also pointed out that Carolyn and I would be better off friends. I know that with all of Carolyn's teasing that sooner or later I'm going to get sexualy fustrated and I'm going to slip up and hurt her, and I don't want to do that. I like her alot, but I do feel that we would be better off friends. So tonight I think I am going to tell her that."

D is to contrling and Falacie herself has told me this. So it's pointless. So this little squabble got me down, and i couldn't get ahold of Carolyn, so I just got more depressed. So I came home, and wanted to cut really bad. I got online and Carolyn was on, so I talked with her and everything just slipped away. She truely makes me happy. I have to wait to date her, but I'm willing to deal with that. It just gives us more time to get to know each other anyway. I guess it's time to call Falacie and tell her to come get her shit."

I love my purple hair. Rain bought me a terrot deck. It's geourgous. After doing a few reading, I found out some gerat news that is going to be taking place in the future. Today was woundermus. i felt kind of bad because I didn't invite carolyn along, but i needed to talk with Rain and her boyfriend about somethings involving her, so it was okay I guess.

I found it in the most unlikely place, and when I had given up looking. I guess that is the way it always works isn't it? Her name is Carolyn. I hung out with her a few times, but she had a boyfriend. Well they broke up, because he was beating her dog. Well the same night they broke up, she got all cuddely with me, becasue she was lonely. Well we got to talk and what not, and we've now spend the last few days hanging out. We're taking things slow, because she dosen't want to date right away, and thats fine with me. She's a cute sweet innocent little virgin, that is slightly shelterd, but thats fine by me. When she is in my arms she makes me happy, and all of my problems just vanish. As soon as I see her my eyes light up and if I was depressed it goes away. I haven't spent enough time with her to see if she what he flaws are, but for now she has none, she is wounderful. This isn't going to be a strictaly sexual realtionship, and that is great to. Anyway here is a small poem that needs work, I just kind of wrote it fast and it needs some work.

There are not enough hours in the day,
with you in my arms is where I wish to stay
I can not spend enough time with you
letting go is hard to do.

My eyes light up when you walk in the room,
my heart skips a beat when ever you smile
and I can't help but smile in return
everytime you look at me.

You pushed away the darkness
that was enveloping me
just by being you
but there are not enough hours in the day

You are in my thoughts all the time
Is she okay, is she happy
what is going through her mind
is she thinking of me?

I always hate to break our embrace
when i am close to you my problems go away
I could care less about the world around me
you are my happyness now even just as my friend."

Well Rob was all over Amanda and it was bothering me a little bit, but I wasn't letting it show. Well Rob went to the bathroom and Amanda asked if it botherd me, I told her the truth, yeah it did a little bit. She just smiled and said. ""Don't worrie about it because he's not the one thats going home with me, you are"" Well He came back and we talked for a bit and Amanda said she was ready to go, Rob invited himself to stay at Amanda, that just wasn't going to work. I stopped and got gas, and Rob went in to get a pack of gum. Amanda told me that she didn't want to be alone with him, so I told him i was going to take him home and just drove him home regardless of what he said. So I went home with Amanda and well ~giggles~ I guess you can say I got my first B-day present of the day. There is only one person that I want to say happy B-day to me, and I know it won't happen. She won't take the time, she won't even care. Thats fine I guess. Amanda has already given me the best b-day gift, so I'm not worried about what else I get. Well A Very Merry Un-Birthday to the rest of you!!!

"event","Not a whole lot new going on. I lost another friend again, but thats because she messed it up this time. It's her fault and if she thinks that I'm going to forgive her for it she's dead wrong. Talked with Falacie, like really talked with her, no fighting, no bickering, no hidden under tones, nothing. it was okay. I could tell something was on her mind thats he wanted to talk about, but was affraid to. Thats fine she dosen't want to tell me then she dosen't want to. I ran into her a her boi thing lastnight, and had a slight altercation with them. I hopped up and was standing in the empty booth at their table talking to the table behind them, well I went over and sat down and D moved over to the both that was getting in and out of. Well I asked ""What did you move so I'd stop bothering them"" D said No I wasn't that important.Well before I could say anything Amanda moved us away from them. The thing that pissed me off is that Falacie was laughing about it. She choice him.. who she has known for a few months, over me that she has known for 6 years. It wasn't D it was Falacie that made me sooo mad. After having a decent conversation the night before she has to go and do something like that. Well I guess I can't get to mad. I'm over her. 

Speeking of that, after having some alone time in a quite house I have come to the conclustion that Flacie has been right for the past year. I didn't love her. We were just going through the motions of being in love because it made us comfortable. It made us feel wanted. Yes I'm using us, because she was doing it to. But no I didn't love her, not like I thought I did anyway. Strong feelings? Yes there were. After spedning six years with someone your going to have deep rooted feelings for them. Love is a strong word, and It's one that I'm not going to throw around lightly any more. So You heard it here first I haven't love you for a long time. Why did I support you? Why did I spend hundreds of dollars on you? I don't know yet."

"event","So last night I went out dancing at The Loft.I showed up early so I didn't have to pay the cover (Good point number 1 of the night) Put on a great lightshow and had everyone there cheering me on. Nothing feels better then that.(Good point number 2 for thoes of you counting along at home) I got asked to dance buy a really cute gothy/punk boi that hangs out there all the time. (Number 3) I had an intrestig conversation with him. It's funny my first run in with him I was rolling on X and without me telling him he knew. So 2 o' Clock rolled around and I went to Denny's in hopes to see Amanda (A cute little redhead that I've had my eye on since I met her) She wasn't there at first, but she showed up a few mins after I did. Her and her sister hasd be out dancing at another bar. I got an massive order of fries that were free (Good point number 4) We sat around and talked. Amanda told me that she went and saw her boyfriend and that he said while he was locked up she could have sex with who ever she wanted, so joking around I told her I was comming home with her. She said okay. So we ate our food, and went to her sister house. I'l leave the details out since I'm sure you all don't want to hear them. (Good point number 5) Finaly 6 o' clock rolled around and we were both tired, so I tucked her in and left. That is the extent of my woundermus night. Came home and passed out untill a half hour ago. I know that Amanda has to go back to her boi in a few months, but thats okay untill then I can keep her company. I just have to tell myself not to get attached. I think with all the times I've been hurt in a realtionship I can do that."

"event","Why can't I get you out of my mind? Why do I wounder if your okay? Why do I worrie about you? Why, when I know you could careless how I am, or what I'm doing. I do want to say sorry that I keep calling your and D's realtionship perfect, because it's not, it never will be. I have my own reasons behind saying that, but I also know that it's not. I know you, and I know that you tell me everything is fine, and dandy when I know better Falacie. I know that I may be an ass sometimes, and I'm sorry, but it's part of me getting over you, so it's something that we have to work through. I know that your not going to turn to anyone for help when you need to talk, you refuse to, It's not in your nature, you think no one cares. I don't care if you hate me, you know you can call and talk to me no matter what hour of the night, just like any of my othr friends can, the one thing that makes you diffrent from the rest of my friends is that we spent almost 6 years together. Six years that I see drifting through my hands like grains of sand. You say that you want to hang out but D has to be there. I refues to hang out with D. The night he drove drunk to Denny's and laughed at me when I bitched him out, had permently put him on my list. If he were to tell me he were sorry, then we might have a diffrent story. Sure I could ignore him like I do when I see you two at Denny's but thats just going to make alot of tention that we don't need. None if it matters one bit I guess because like you said your done with me. Thats fine, like Rayne said, live in the now not in the past right? But I really would like to know, do you think of me at all anymore Falaice? Have you really shut me out of your mind? Can't you forget the momories that have forever stuck in your head? Have you forgotten about the most romantic night we ever had? Have you forgotten about our walks at the nature center? Have you forgotten me? All of this rushes through my head at times and I just want it to go away because I know the reply and it's yes, I know you have, why? Because you told me one night, while i was crying in bed just looking to talk to you, just to forget about you, forget out about our past, the good and the bad, so I assume that you've done the same. Falacie do you really know why I wrote that last angy post to you? Because, if your mad and not talking to me it makes it easy for me to forget."

"event","o0o Next weekend is my friend Clarissa's 18th birthday...she wants to be silly and go to a strip club for her party, well I was invited, and Im contemplating whether I should go or not. I mean it would be funny to look at the girls and laugh at how slutty they are...but I dont want any girl hoo-hoo's rubbin up in my face, no sir! I dont allow that, I'll have to take that stripper down, down to Chinatown. haha Do you have to give the strippers money when you go there? cause I dont want to pay some girl to dance around us..Im a ""cheap bastard"" I'll admitt it...We talked about going to a male strip club instead...but the thought of a man in a g-string scares me. and thats all there is to say about that. I like Pink Lemonade...its good."

"event","Finally, the moment every young internet user, weblog keeper inticipates! The very FIRST entry! *gasps* Actually there isn't much hoopla about this site. You must be very bored if you eyes have already made it down this far. I really don't have much to say...I mean its 12:45am and I can't sleep, what else is new? And ya know, this site is rather hard to figure out if your a newbie...its very complexed for a brain working so hard, so late. My hamsters having a heart attack, and the grasshopper can't make it on it's own. So the brain's about to die soon to sleep in it's peaceful slumber until its awaken at 6am by that gawd aweful screech that comes from that thing called an alarm clock. I hate school. Why do they have to make it so early. Ya know, I bet anyone, anything that if they moved the time to say...11am, a lot more people would actually show up to school. and they wonder why attendence sucks..who wants to wake up at 6am and go watch spit-scum gather in the corner of an old geezard's mouth while he tries to explain why 2+2=4. I think I have about 15 pictures on my digital camera of fellow students sleeping in class. It's my new project. I'm making a collage with them and showing the school how boring it is. School should be like a circus. Everyone enjoys a circus. You'd rather watch a clown fit into a tiny car, rather than the Freshman(who seem to look like grown men with a wife and kids) fit into one of the tiny desk..wait a minute. I take that back, that is rather funny. but back to the point, I just dont like school...and a lotta other people don't either. But then again, I don't want to go out in the world on my own, part of me likes the comfort of good ole highschool. But it's my time to shine, move on and experience bigger and better things, which I will, trust me, soon I'll be movin' to a double wide with the 6 kids! haha jk. Wow, I ramble a lot...Im sorry. I shall quit now. Who knows what the future will bring, only time will tell. Until then, stay in school, remember to take your vitamins, and kiss your mother goodnight."

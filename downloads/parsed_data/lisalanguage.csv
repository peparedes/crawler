"event","""Tomorrow is March 1st."" 
I have heard this about four times today. And every time people said this to me they always followed it with, ""Only 28 days this month."" I could only respond with a ""yep."" 

Meanwhile at work, on a piece of paper where I had to list some dates, I took February into the 32nd day. My boss said, ""Lisa, I'll give you the 30th. The 31st is a stretch, but the 32nd? Come on."" I threw my hands up. I just need some more February. 

Anyway, it got me to thinking (as well it should have) that time passes differently now that I'm older. This is also another observation people have pointed out to me before. The general consensus is that it seems to go faster. I think it's because we're used to it all by now. For example, I have now experienced Christmas 25 times. My neice has only had 7 Christmases. I already know about Santa, and the lights, and the trees, but it is still new to her. It's old to me, been there done that, another one bites the dust, nothing's new under the sun.

Or maybe we're all so rushed to get to the next hour/minute/day that we see the months just disappear. Your foot on the gas is quicker than your moments of being? 

So I can't wait until I'm forty, the time is flying at an incredible rate of speed, and I'm bored as hell. But for right now, thank god for those moments at work of great attention to detail under pressure."

"event","I speak Spanish with Spanish speaking customers.  I will even say ""Obrigado"" to the Portuguese people.  I'm doing business with these people.  I don't impose, I just try to make it easier for them to come back and furthmore and most importantly, I'm practicing to get better.  

One time there was a little girl about five years old translating for her mother.  When I chimed in with my Spanish, the little girl said to her mother, ""She can speak Spanish too?""  I told her I could speak a little bit but she could speak both languages really well.  She nodded her head at me proudly.  Her mother smiled at her proudly too, because even though she may not have understood my language, she understood what had taken place between her daughter and me.  

Jess, the other assistant manager, was watching me at another time where I was using my Spanish and she didn't surprise me when she got pissed.  She said the usual argument I've heard from many white Americans: they should learn the language, in other countries they wouldn't speak English just to appease us.  I acknowledged the way she felt and moved along with my day.  (she isn't easily argued with, so I didn't even try)

When I told another person what Jess had said to me, she responded with, ""Well I'm going to have to agree with her there because you never know what they're saying, they could be talking about you right in front of you.""  

I told her that her ancestors probably came to this country not knowing a word of English and nobody is talking about her.  They're talking about the same thing that everyone else is talking about when they shop--should I try this on, this one's a medium, maybe I should get a large, look they have pink and green, etc etc.

I don't mean to be preachy, but I just like reality.  Everyone's situations are different and while I don't think people should be victims of their circumstance, I know that connecting with people is the way to go about my business."

"event","Last night after I went really blond at the salon, I took a little ride and saw a black limousine driving around the streets of my neighborhood.  It made these little streets seem fantastic, spectacular, high-brow.  

But, it made me think of another big black car, the hearse.  I can remember as a child frequently seeing death's transport.  They always seem to capture me, with their curtained windows, and I thought, I never see a hearse anymore.  Have they stopped bringing the dead to their final destinations in these beautiful cars?  Are they throwing them in boxes and shipping them in unmarked trucks? You can't tell me that people are not dying at the rate they used to. Or is it really a reflection of the economy: do hearses cost too much for the general layperson?  When a hearse drives by, everyone notices and acknowledges, but if there is no reminder then death is forgotten.  On Valentine's eve, I felt robbed of death.

I do have to say, as I exhaled that first drag, it surprised me, kind of amazed me, kind of turned me on. I'm thinking this better be the man of my dreams. Then, he opened his mouth and had an accent.  Most girls love the accents but I'm thinking fuck, another foreigner.  There are only two kinds of men that approach me, men who are ten plus years older than me and men from other countries, Italy, Kenya, Armenia, Jamaica, and now Turkey.  

We had a fabulous conversation.  He told me he was Muslim.  I told him there was a stigma attached to that.  He knew this was unfortunate.  We talked about Muhammad and Jesus, Fundamentalism and America the beautiful.  He told me I was sweet.  My friends left us.  Then they returned.  I told him we were going to dance, nice talking to him.  He asked if he could join us.  We four danced.  Then, we told him we were going to the bathroom.  Continued to follow me around when he knew we didn't go to the bathroom.  Told me his mother tried to set him up on an arranged marriage.  He didn't want that.  My friends told him I had a boyfriend.  Girls night out, no guys.  I said goodbye.

I don't care what country you're from, you do not mention marriage on the first meeting or date.  Ha.  

Then, I gratefully go to sleep alone and hate men for awhile.  Until I go out and another forty year old Mr. Foreigner follows me around, wants to light all my cigarettes because I have a brain.  I take it back.  I don't want a forward guy.  Being Single in the Melting Pot is definitely taking its toll on me."

"event","So, here I am, mad because my show is a repeat.  This life has definitely taken a turn for the weird.  I now have shows that I watch faithfully on television. I never used to be a big tv watcher.  On surveys that would ask how much tv I watched, I would always answer 0-3 hours per week and I was being honest.  I would never care about what day it was or what was coming on that night.  Yeah, I would channel surf but only get bored and move on to some other activity because there was never anything on.  Well, now I know, you have to plan this watching life or else you will never get any enjoyment out of it, the life or the tv.  What am I saying?!

So yeah, when I found out the show was a repeat, I got mad and called Michelle, who I found in repeat denial.  She said, ""Maybe they made a mistake and they'll turn it off, switch it to the new episode.""    

Everything they taught me is going to waste.  They taught me that television is bad because it makes me feel dumb, ugly, un-hip, lonely, poor, sedentary, hypnotized--lacking just about everything.  So I raise the question:

Why am I a loyal watcher?
a. I'm turning into my mother (aaaaaahhhhhhhh!).
b. I'm becoming more responsible, forcing myself to create this tv routine so I can look forward to getting into bed---by ten.  
c. It's because everyone else does it and I'm sick of saying, No I never saw that show.  Furthermore, I can't make small talk if I have nothing small to say and televison is pretty small.
d. I've FINALLY accepted the status quo and it has accepted me.
e. There was never anything worth watching before.  

Answer: Nothing can MAKE me feel anything.  I feel it on my own."

     Please don't get me wrong here.  I am not thinking, ""Oh my god!! I'd better get married if people my age are having babies.""  I am not putting pressure on myself.  I microwave.  I sleep in till twelve.  I mean, come on now.  But Becky's weird.  
     It's a mystery--this Becky.  One day she just upped and left and didn't let any of her friends know where she was going.  Michelle went over to her house one day to return a book she borrowed and Becky wasn't there.
  (I'm going down to that Shell station where her mother works to ask for Becky's address so I can write her a letter.)
     I thought about Becky when I went to Midnight Mass with my mother.  I went to that same church with her once when we were in high school.  She always sang all of the songs and had herself a wonderful time. 
     Midnight Mass was a trip though.  The priest just complained the whole time about Christmas not being about Christ anymore.  I went to hear about what Christ was like, but instead he said, ""So, I'm going to say Merry Christmas because nobody can tell me what to do in here.""  The parishoners clapped; they hooted. 
     It used to be a personal thing.  It was beautifully decorated though.  They dimmed the lights at one point and everyone sang Silent Night.  I almost fell hazily asleep, like Nyquil (actually it was probably all that histamine from that incense--oh boy, I sneezed--they blessed me).  And then at the end of the mass the priest said, ""It looks like Macy's in here, well no, it looks better than Macy's in here!""  Product Placement in the House of Friggin God.  What's next?

The other day, my friend told me to have a good night robbing men of their manhood.  And I did, too.  This guy was literally chasing me around the dance floor, telling me he loved me and that I was the sexiest thing in the world.  He wanted my phone number but I didn't give it to him.

Cats rob me of my health.  I am now sneezy because of a cat.

Now, thanks to me, men are not men, cats are not cats (they are little sneeze demons), and money is not money because there would never be enough money anywhere for me to steal it (unless it was in the pocket of a man and even then money wouldn't be money because I would just benefit from the goods and services bought).

"event","People come and people go.  This has been something I've recognized my entire life.  I've moved around so much and have known many people so far.  I'm concerned with both the coming and the going.  Some people I've broken relations with on purpose because of a misunderstanding or personal argument.  Others I've just lost touch with, simply enough.  

But some people come and they never go, even after I've tried to break relations with them in the past by telling them why I really cannot continue relations. But, they (I've collected a few) keep coming back or I keep coming back to them.  Either way, they stay.  So with these people there is still some bad blood between us and I just don't know what to do about that bad blood.  

For instance, I became really close to one of my friends and she decided I was becoming too needy. Instead of telling me this, she needed to be rude to me.  So I took the hint and did not call her but it did hurt.  Sure as shit, she called me after a month or so and wanted to hang out.  So now we play phone tag games and it's getting really annoying.  I kind of just want to tell her what's on my mind but for some reason I can't.  

My biggest question is, why does she play too?  Maybe because she cares about me?  And it's not just her, there are others too.  But people come and go, right? But then that means people don't owe each other anything.  I can try to remind myself that we don't but I really can't stop thinking that we do because we've shared so much.  

I am an honest person.  Ask anyone that knows me.  I've often told friends in the past exactly what I've thought about them and they either stay or go.  I think most of them stay because they like it.  They want me to keep telling them off just so they can resent me and come back at me with these little jabs.  So in attempts to slow down that sort of behavior, I've now resorted to playing games.  But, I'm just not happy with playing games either because this bad blood eats away at me constantly.

"event","So, there I was watching Desperate Housewives with girlfriends and it breaks to commercial.  Now, we all know what to expect: cleaning products, coming attractions for the news at eleven, coming attractions for new movies, and the dreadful depression commercials.  Those depression commercials with the women opening windows to see a brighter day or that little white bobble head thing bouncing around in the dark only to take a pill and be surrounded by more bobble heads friends, but no, not this time.  This time they have some people rubbing their backs, rubbing their necks, their legs and the announcer starts talking about how depression can affect your physical self as well as your emotional self.  

I'm thinking this is crazy.  It's like those army recruiting commercials.  Ok, ad execs, numbers are down, now think of something good, come on, you can do it.  It seems like a new ploy to get more people to take these pills but are they really having a problem convincing the public that they have problems? It even show a figure of a person taking the pill and this magic blue light streams down it's spine and voila the person is now healed of all pain, emotional and now physical.  And you know the next day there is a woman eating lunch counseling her friend about Bernie's recent back pain, hey it couldn't hurt to try.  At least in Brave New World they kept it real: you take soma because you want a holiday not because you have a backache.

Furthermore, I'm watching this commercial as the 4 year old son of the girlfriend whose tv I'm watching every sunday night is on a different medication every month because of the new diagnosis every month. She was even filling out a survey about her son's emotions while we were watching this. One of the questions was, ""Does he hold a grudge?"" and my other friend said he held a grudge against a former ex-boyfriend of hers. The mother of the 4 year old son says, ""well maye that's because he saw Blaine hold me down to the ground and beat on me.""  And I can't say a damn word because I know she's heard all of this before.  Then I start thinking maybe she should be on medication.  

So they can't have bad numbers, people are on this shit, people's kids are on this shit.  It's like Ellen Degeneres says in her 2003 stand up HBO special, ""Back when I was a kid, we just had crazy people.""  

Desperate Housewives was great though.

Do you ever have those days where you just can't stand yourself? Have you ever annoyed yourself? I mean, I wake up and have days that are unexpectedly filled with mishaps and some that are unexpectedly filled with awesomeness. Those are fine to laugh at and/or enjoy, but it's not either of those days.  I just keep thinking of Wordsworth's ""I wandered lonely as a cloud"" and usually it works but today those flowers are no consolation.  Yeah maybe I am lonely.  There. I admitted it.

Or Maybe Loneliness is the true human suffering.  Everyone for ages has always written about this human suffering, like crying and moaning and just suffering.  Well maybe loneliness is not just suffering for the said individual but also for others.  Said lonely individual goes to other individual who is not feeling so lonely today and bothers the hell out of them with woes unbelievable.  Then, said individual has lost the good feelings from other individuals because after all who's loneliness is this?  So I ain't calling no one.  I'm just going to be brave and not reach out to anyone.  I'm just going to keep annoying myself.  

I mean, any guy could walk through my front door and tell me something nice about myself and I'd be all over him, like desperate flies on shit.

Yeah, but the sun is shining.  So maybe I'll take the gas card my mom let me borrow and get some gas.  Then maybe I'll just put on some music and clean the hell out of my room, put some real elbow grease into something. Then maybe someone will call me and brighten my stupid quiet unadorned boring day.

I felt some true guilt for these actions while I was sitting on the can at the Cumberland Farms.  I thought I was going to have a peaceful little time, a much needed time, in there but I didn't because I was staring at a five foot Sobe bottle on the wall, two three feet Mountain Dew bottles, a pre paid cellular phone ad, and a hypnotic ad for the lottery.  This lottery ad said FUN! in the middle of a target with maroon, pink, and yellow circles around it.  I stared at this ad, sitting on the can, and just as I was about to break and agree that the lottery is fun, I remembered that I don't win especially when I'm being mindfucked by the government.  Fuck that shizzo.  I'd rather have a natural ability to bluff texas hold 'em style.  If you're going to gamble please don't separate yourself anymore from the others than you already emotionally are.  Don't play lottery, play some good pool or poker.  Bet on a horse.  At least you're having an experience at the same time instead of buying the ticket, carrying it in your wallet, and then throwing it out when you lose.  I'd rather throw my fifty up in the air when I win at the track.  

However fucked up gambling is, littering probably is too.  But, then there's a new I-don't-give-a-fuck philosophy that just takes me over and makes me throw shit out the window of my car because I'm not going to be here for the fucked up world of future generations.  Fuck em.

Enron had a much bigger screw factor.  They should be in jail fucking Martha in the ass.  I can see how this is a Women's rights issue, of course.  Martha, the woman, the madonna, if you will, is taking one for the team in this situation.  She is going down only because the men of Enron didn't.  Bad Boys, don't do it again.  Bad Martha, you are going to Jail where you have to force off the lesbians in droves?

<i>There's a 


Hesitance 

When you say you love me 
And your heart doesn't beat as fast 
As it once did 
When we're all wrapped up 
Limbs spilling over the wode 
Of the double bed 
And when I kiss you you always 


Close your eyes 


Whereas before you said to stare into the blue of mine 
Was a look into heaven and beyond 
And when we lay there with nothing to say 
No longer do you draw 

Imaginary intricate patterns 

On my skin that used to tremble at your touch 
And my heart beats quickly for I am afraid 
Of losing you 
And being 


Alone 


Again. 


Let's go back to endless summer nights 
Where on the pretense of heat 
We would shed our clothes 
And just worship the othes body 
My pillarr of strength you seem to be 


melting 

With the icy looks you give me.</I>"

Walking through the supermarket
Frozen peas staring at me
I knew it was you.

I stammered
I breathed so quick
I felt alone to hear your voice
Trying to make you believe
That I don't miss a thing.

Slow beat's singing in my head
I just can't let you go
You sound so far away
And I find my fingers tracing your name
On the glass of the freezers
As the pizzas starve for warth

Like me.


You ask me how it's going
And the softness in my reply gives me away
And you pause
And you take a breathe
And I die to hear you admit
You love me.

It's an eternity
I don't notice the woman trying to get by me
Narrow
Cold aisle

Like me.


You say,
""I'm sorry.""

And right in the middle of frozen foods
I cry.

In 5 hours I'll be exhausted again but it's getting so I'm terrified to go to sleep anymore. Because the dream I keep having, over and over, it terrifying. And I can't get the look of horror on Anthony's face outta my mind. I wish i could have done something, I hope! hope!! hope!!! he wasn't looking out the window, I couldn't handle it if he saw what was happeneing, and I hope it was quick, maybe he didn't even know what happened....

Like I feel guilty to be alive now... 

I keep falling asleep, convinced I will never wake up again ~ and I don't like this panic I'm struck with in NYC now. I don't think they are done, and what if they get me? Or even worse - get my mom???

I dunno.

It's all craziness. I just wish it never happened.

<i>
I thought that maybe 
I would sense it when you were gone 
I thought that maybe 
It I closed my eyes 
I would feel where you were 
But nothing happened 
And no one heard a word 
And I can't go to sleep now 
For I see your fate every night
When i close my eyes
And darkness pervails
Your horror is reflected
In the windows of a jet
Screaming to claim your life.

"event","I just got off the phone with an old friend who couldn't stop crying. It was a guy of course, coz they always seem to be the ones that make it so us girls cry so hard we don't even wanna go on. I told her she could come to NY and spend a few weeks with me but she said there's nothing more she wants to do then stay curled up in bed for a few months.

Guys suck.

I wonder why I seemed to have gotten the one good then, then I get upset that I had to go thru so many stupid men before I found him.. wouldn't it be great if we met the person perfect for us without being scarred from th past losers?

What happens to the losers anyway? Becaus eyou know, when you are like 45 years old there are no more men left, they are all married off, so I guess SOMEONE marries them.... do they just die if they are bad? Nope, they ussaly end up finding a woman with no backbone to cater to thier every wish... isn't life fun?

<i>
There was something about waking up to the phone ringing 
Sleepy smiles 
Hearing your voice from across the world 
Greeting me with laughter in your voice 
Gently teasing me as if 
I had been the one to drive in the wrong lane 
On the highway late at night. 

I don't miss the three am calls firected at me so that you 
Wouldn't fall asleep behinmd the wall of your 
Life on wheels as you called your 
Car as you travelled from one end of the world 
To another and yet never finding time 
To stop in New York 
Yet you always said you wanted a cup of my milky smooth coffee. 

At some point I think I created you into a man you never were 
Made your eyes a little bluer than they really were 
Made your hands able to fix everything 
That goes wrong inside of me 
And I think I gave you a power reserved for God alone 
And the the day that I realized 
When you were in NY for that cup of milky coffee 
That you just weren't the handyman I thought you were. 

And I broke so bad I don't think I'll ever be right.

Light waves cascading down a satin smooth back

Afraid to break the spell.

Lighting her as she makes a melody from her soul 
I can't hear it but I feel it 
Surrounding me tighter than Saturns rings 
As she closes her eyes to the universe.

"event","The door creaked open, and Mindy was led into a brightly lit office complete with fireplace, and fire. It was warm and pleasent after the dampness of the waiting room.
""I'm here to see Tranice DeVille. Is she in?"" Mindy asked the tiny receptionist.
""Ummm... Do you have an appointment?"" The woman's voice quavered.
Mindy admitted that she didn't have one.
""Then you can't see her."" Said the receptionist in a firm whisper.
Mindy's temper flared.
""I'm nineteen I do what I want!"" she shouted, and with that she stormed past the little woman's desk and through the door behind it.
There were jagged bones, and several recently shrunken heads hanging above the door. Mindy shuddered as she turned the bone handle."

"event","Despite the excessive number of candels in the small room, the light was dim, and while Mindy peered into the dark corners of the waiting room she began to feel drowsy. She was woken from a doze by the creak of a door being opened. She looked towards the door connecting to the chambers of the Office of Student Affairs, but it remained firmly shut. Confused, she looked around the small room, and saw a wood panel close quietly. She got up and looked carefully at the edges of the panel. It was a seamless hidden door. It was impossible to open it from the outside. She now saw that the number on the blackboard had been changed to ""seven."" She hurried to sit, just as the door to the OSA opened and a small shrivelled woman called out 
""Seven! Number seven!"" 
She looked around the small room through her thick glasses and shrugged. The woman turned to close the door, but Mindy was too fast for her. With her foot lodged between the door and the frame, she asked the old lady if she could have her turn, since number seven was not present. The woman, who resembled a mouse, gave her a frightened glance and tried to shut the door. 
""You have to wait your turn!"" She said, and continued to shove the door into Mindy's foot."

"event","After learning that Seamus' and Patience's meeting with the president had gone well, Mindy prepared to do battle with Tranice Deville. She wanted that room, and she was ready to fight for it.
As she approached the Office of Student Activities a faint scent of burning wood reached Mindy's nose. She had heard rumors that Tranice could incinerate unsuspecting students with one glance, but she had never believed it. The knot in her stomach tightened as she realized the truth. The long hallway separating the rest of Founder's hall from the OSA was painted red, and decorated with pictures of college students laughing on the quadrangle at various campus events. The hallway grew warmer as Tranice's office loomed closer. 
Mindy paused beneath the arch leading to the office. It was a gothic structure carved out of dark wood. It stood out among the other office doors because of it's unusual size and shape. The door itself was also oversized and gothically imposing. The doorknob was situated high on the door, making it appear even larger than it was. As a result, any student unfortunate enough to have business with the Office of Student Affairs began to feel extremely uncomfortable upon reaching the door. Mindy gathered her courage and turned the knob.
The door opened silently into a marble hallway. The expansive interior stretched high above Mindy's head. The width of the space was doubly unexpected, as she seemed to have entered a castle of some sort. The hall was lit by candles bracketed to the walls, and in the dim light Mindy could just see the domed marbel ceiling stretching away from her into the gloom. The ceiling itself was decorated with painted panels depicting a variety of cultural dieties. There were two rows of orante marbel columns supporting the glittering ceiling, and in the distance another archway and door shone in the darkness. The door seemed to be light from behind, and glowed faint red in the darkness. 
Her footsteps echoed as she hurried through the twilight. Mindy knocked confidently on the red door. The whole entrance was intended to frighten weak students, but Mindy did not intend to be overcome so easily. 
The door opened silently inward, and Mindy found herself in a sort of ante-room with a door leading out on the opposite side of the room. Like the marbel hall, the room was lit with candels, but because of the small space, and lack of windows, the room was hot and stuffy, where the hall had been damp and cold. Dark wood paneling covered the walls, and a low wooden bench ran around the perimiter of the room. the ceiling was low, and ancient tapestries adorned the walls. They were worn in places on the artwork, and grooves in the bench where students had sat while waiting to be called in to see Deville. Mindy picked a numbered paper off a hook in the wall to her right. There was a small blackboard next to the numbers with a single ""six"" written on it. The room was deserted. Mindy wondered where number seven had gone. She sat down to wait, refusing to be intimidated by her surroundings."

"event","Seamus and Patience approached the President's wing of the castle slowly, neither was anxious to complete their part of the plan. Both were friendly with the college's President, but were reluctant to presume on their friendship. 
Patience gave Seamus an apprehensive look as she raised her hand, but before she could knock the door was opened and President Goldman stood before them. 
""Hello!"" His faint southern accent floated pleasently to Patience and Seamus. ""Would you like to come in for a snack? I just have to run for a second, but I'll be back. Come in and make yourselves at home. There's soda and tea, and prezels and cookies, so help yourself"" He was off before they could reply. They entered the office, laughing quietly to themselves, and helped themselves to refreshments.

An hour later Patience and Seamus emerged from the President's office. 
""You two are so great!"" President Goldman called after them, laughing.
""Well, it's alright with the President. Now comes the hard part. I hope Mindy is up to it."" Patience smiled. The meeting had gone swimingly, and both were much encouraged by the President's reception.
""I hope he comes to the party"" said Seamus. ""The invitation you gave him was amazing. I think he was pretty excited to be invited."" 
""I just hope this works"""

"event","The first few weeks of school flew by, and it was a surprise to Patience, and everyone else, when her birthday arrived so quickly. Patience and Rozalia were sharing party since there birthdays were only a week apart. A week before the party the word got out, and the whole campus was talking about it. Nobody was really sure why the student body was so interested in this party since neither of the birthday girls were especially popular, but they were interested none the less. 

The girls were cleaning and decorating their rooms for the big night, when Seamus ran into the room. He was bouncing up and down as usual, and seemed to be agitated. 
""EVERYONE is coming to this party!"" he said. ""Everybody I know is talking about it! Some guy in my Spanish class invited me to it today. That was kind of strange..."" He trailed off looking puzzled.
The girls looked at each other, and the crepe paper they were trying unsuccessfuly to drap over the windows. 
""What should we do?"" Mindy asked.
""I think we may need a bigger room"" Seamus suggested. 
""You're fucking kidding me! There aren't any bigger rooms!"" Cindy said throwing her hands up in frusteration.
""Calm down, we can solve this."" Sinead, as usual, was the voice of reason.
Rozalia, Beth, and Patience looked on with interest.
""What if... we reserve a room in the castle?"" Sinead asked no one in particular. ""Patience, you and Seamus know the president. Go and ask him. Then we can find out how to make a reservation."" Sinead continued.
""We'd have to go through Tranice Deville to do it."" Seamus' comment was met with apprehensive silence. No one liked to deal with Tranice Deville. She made every interaction with the office of student activities needlessly difficult and unpleasent. 
""Hold on..."" Patience mused, ""Mindy could go, yes? She's black."" 
Tranice's preference for her own ethnicity was legendary. 
""Let's go now!"" Seamus was bouncing again."

"event","The six girls if Damman 2-8 had settled into their rooms, and were mostly unpacked by four o'clock that afternoon. The friendly chatter and laughter had continued throughout the day, and they were just sitting down to tea (a habit Patience intended to get them into) when there was a knock at the door. 
""I'll get it."" Said Patience as she set the tea pot on the table. 
The door swung open as soon as she turned the knob, and she was startled to suddenly find herself in the arms of David Blackburn.
""Hello, Patience"" he said, as he bent over her, all the while looking past her at someone in the hallway. 
""2-9, don't forget--"" he said, but a yell from the hallway drowned out the rest. 
Patience gracefully extricated herself from David's dip, and laughed, as Seamus Fitzpatrick skidded to a stop right in front of David who had expertly placed himself between Patience and Seamus. David threw his chest out and laughed. 
""Come on Blackburn, let me through. I haven't seen her all summer!"" Seamus shouted as he looked up at David, who was much taller than Seamus. He was almost jumping up and down in frustration.  
David laughed and stepped aside, obviously putting a finger to his lips in a gesture of silence, and catching Seamus's eye as he did so. 
""Patience, until later..."" And after a dramatic pause the brilliant philisophical mind moved off down the hallway.
Seamus looked after him, and sighed in exasperation. 
""He always DOES that. I wanted to see you first!"" He said as he turned to Patience, ""I met him in the parking lot. He told me to grab some of his stuff and carry it in, then he ran off. He beat me here."" He looked dejected.
Patience laughed, and kissed him on the cheek.
""It's brilliant to see you again. All the girls are here. You haven't had tea?"" 
""I think I left my car open, actually... Yes I DID get my license! And I have to go make sure that Ronan doesn't break anything. I'm helping him move in first."" Ronan was Seamus's brother. Both had red hair, and looked almost identical, despite the fact that Seamus was three years older. He smiled crookedly, ""But I missed you all summer.""
Patience smiled as Seamus went running down the hallway. Full of energy as usual, and always ready to help his friends. 

Just as Patience had sat down, poured her tea, and told the girls who was at the door, there as another knock. 
""I'll get it this time."" 
The girls all watched to see who was there, and were happy to see Jamal Higgens stroll through the door that Mindy held open for him.
""'Sup sistas?! I've got some new jokes for you!"" Said Jamal, through a cloud of brown frizz. His hair had become exceptionally unruly over the summer, and it now mushroomed out of his head, and flowed behind him so as to make his usual stylish sweat-band necessary to keep his hair out of his eyes. Otherwise, he had not changed.
In the previous school year Jamal had learned that he was 1/43rd African American, and since then he had mantained a luxorious 'fro in recognition of his heritage. 
Jamal agreed to sit down to tea with the girls, and they caught up on everyone's summer. 

Although Patience as anxious to see Seamus again, she grudgingly undestood his obligation to help his brother. Patience and Seamus had begun dating in the previous March, and spending the summer on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean had been rather difficult for both of them. Patience had waited all summer to see Seamus, and she could wait a little longer. Although, ironically, she had always been rather impatient."

"event","After a few minutes Patience heard a sound from down the hall. She knew immediately what it was, and she smiled to herself as she waited for the noise to come closer. 
Sinead Hall stopped singing and shouted ""ROOMIE!"" as she came into the suite and saw Patience seated on the window sill. They hugged, and Patience commented on Sinead's lovely singing all the way down the hall. 
""I could hear you as soon as you came in the building! It's wonderful. I'm so glad we're living together!""
Sinead laughed as she pushed her dark brown bangs out of her eyes, and moved towards the bedroom she and Patience would be sharing. Sinead Hall was a tall, slender soprano. She had long, and dark brown hair, and porcelain skin. The two had met in their music classes the previous year, and after a short, and mutually misunderstood rivalry had become close friends. The two exchanged small talk and travel stories as they waited for the other girls to arrive.
""How's Lance?"" Patience couldn't stop herself from asking. 
Lance Goldberg and Sinead had been dating for almost a year.
""Oh, he's doing very well. His band played all over New England this summer. I got to see several shows in Boston."" She giggled. ""They've begun branching out more into hip-hop, and I think Lance is going to write a few rap verses for their next new set... apparently he's rather good."" 

The next suitemate to arrive was Mindy Stevens. Both Patience and Sinead went out to help her carry her boxes from her car to the suite. Mindy was notorious for over-packing. 
""I love what you've done with your hair."" Patience told her, as they lugged her things through the hallways.
""Oh, thanks."" Said Mindy, ""I think it's a little short, but I like the shape. When she didn't stop cutting  I was like, 'Wha' Happened?'""
The three girls laughed.
Mindy had beautiful dark curly hair, and big hazel eyes. She had an exotic look about her due to her Syrian heritage that she enhanced to her advantage with her use of eyeliner and red lipstick.
""Is Cindy here yet?"" She asked ""Or do I get to pick my bed first?""
""I'm  here now!"" Cindy shouted as she came into the room. ""Oh, man I'm already so worried about classes starting! How will I ever keep up! I just don't want to write any late papers this year."" Cindy Stephens was full of energy as usual, and she soon had all the girls laughing as she brought in her things. 
""Your hair has grown out since last Spring."" Sinead mentioned to Cindy.
""Yeah, I didn't know what to do with it, so I just let it grow. Oh my fucking god! NEW ORLEANS WAS AMAZING!""

Rozalia Curt, and Beth Jones arrived together a few minutes later. 
""Oh my god!"" exclaimed Rozalia when she saw the rest of girls, and she ran to give them each hugs. When she got excited she almost always slipped into her accent. She was from Queens,New York.
Beth said hello quietly, and continued to bring in her belongings. Rozalia knew her best, and the rest of the girls were happy to have her in the suite, although they did not know her well. 
""Your hair looks great!"" Rozalia, and Mindy said in unison. 
In the previous spring Rozalia had died her hair red. It was now a lovely light brown with careful blond highlights throughout. The color suited her, and her pale skin and bright eyes were shown off to their best advantage. 
""I'm so short I have to SOMETHING to get attention!"" Shouted the five foot tall Rozalia.
""I'm so glad you kept the bangs."" Patience added.
""You look the same as ever"" Sinead said to Patience. ""You're so reliable!"" She said and the two laughed.
It was true, Patience had looked the same since birth, or so she said. She was tall, thin, freckled, and had short brown hair, which she cut herself out of a strong distrust of hairstylists.
""That's not true, I did get contact lenses."" She said, in a defensive tone."

"event","Patience Moore stepped out of the car and looked up at the castle that rose above her. ""Back again."" She thought as she began to unload her boxes from the hired car and stack them on the curb. As the taxi drove away she noted the numerous families helping to move their children into the college's dormitories. She sighed as she remembered saying goodbye to her own family back in England before her Freshman year, and the long and lonely plane ride that followed. She hurried to carry her boxes into the three story brick building. She was very excited to see her roommates again after the long summer break. It had been relaxing, but a little lonely, and she was very happy to be returning to school. 
Patience was the first of the six to arrive at the suite, and after glancing around the six rooms she settled down to wait for her friends. The first thing she unpacked was her electric kettle, her tea, and her tea cup and pot, and she then set about fixing herself a good cup of tea. A ritual which always calmed and restored her good humor."

"event","Long ago and far away, it was a dark and stormy September first. The towers of a castle stood out dark agains the brooding sky, while a flag beat against the stone of the highest turret. A single light shone in a high window in the structure outlining the silhouette of a man standing with his hands clasped behind his back. As he gazed pensively out the window onto the rain soaked quadrangle, he muttered under his breath in the faintest southern drawl, ""Another year has arrived. The students will be arriving soon."" As he turned his back to the window he added rhetorically, ""What will this year bring?""
The night grew darker and closed in upon the lone man in his castle, folding over him like the ocean waves crashing on a distant moonlit, and solitary shore."

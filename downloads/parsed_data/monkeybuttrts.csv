todayyyyyyy i was w/ my dad and brother
and i was fighting with billy all day
cause he was being really really annoying.
we went to wegmans and then Home Depot (to get paints for these chairs)
and then billy and me went swimming at the neighbors pool
and we brought out towels into the pool cause there was this HUGE horse fly
and it was freaky
so we put the towel over us and hid from it.
then Brigid came over unexpectedly. lol
and we didd stuff
mostly just read a magazine and she signed my board.
it took about 5 minutes for her to sign it
lol
now i'm painting these chairs w/ billy
and its soooooooo annoying cause of the stupid deer flys!!!!!
grrrrr they are the most annoying thing ever!!!!
ok...first we have to get all the crap off of the chairs
and there are like a billion gazillion caccon things and spiders
its really gross. and then we have to get all of the paint chips off
then we have to paint 2 coats.
!!!!!!!gr!!!!!!!!!!
now i'm taking a break
oh yeah and earlier today 
we dumped out this bucket filled with old grass and water (the water was yellow)
the stuff was in the bucket cause sarah bill and me were doing something...yeah...so anyway i dumped it out
and it smelt worse than crapppppppppppp!
it was the grossest smell EVER!
and then like usual my dogs had to go and roll around in it
then my dad had to give them a bath so the bathroom smells like that grass stuff
its really gross.
ok well i'm off to paint

There is always my dads scooter, but its having issues shifting so we'll see. Out of the 20 plus people I invited to go camping only 2 took the initiative to get school work out of the way and request off work, and for what, nothing. SO tomorrow morning I'll be up bright and early to drive 3 hours eachway to go water plants for an hour... I lost all hope for the weekend. And am in a crabby mood. Yay bitching to a blog."

"event","So me being tha lazy ass I am, I skipped out on going to work. My Dad calls me and says Gabi is coming home with an ice pack and that there was an accident when she was playing laser tag. Well 30 minutes pass and she comes home, and she doesn't look too good. She said she was in pain and that it hurt too much to turn her head. I went back a couple minutes later to check on her and she was bent over the toilet. She said she was going to throw up. So I called my Dad, he was already enroute, my other sister ditched work, and my mom just got off and was still at seton. I got her a new icepack for her neck. She started th throw up. My dad came home while i was on the phone with my mom. They talked and then he called 911. My dad sends me outside to wait for EMS. As soon as I walked out there I could already hear them. It took them maybe 5 minutes if that to make here. My sister Emily sped over and tried to park infront of the house but i flagged her over to the driveway. The sirens grew louder, and Emily ran inside. Its a weird feeling, flagging down a fire truck. I led them inside. Less than a minute later EMS pulled upright behind them. I think I counted 6 or 7 guys in my house. All cramming into a little hallway and bathroom. One of the EMTs started asking my sister and I questions. Then my mom came home. They strapped on a neck brace and put her on a stretcher. My mom rode with her to the hospital. The rest of us are just sitting at home. Everyone is leaning towards her being okay, we'll know more when my mom calls...

Update: 5-23-07
Gabi had a cat scan and everything turned out okay. She was discharged and home around 8 or so last night. She's been taking it easy today, at home watching movies and hanging out with my mom. All is more or less well."

Some speculation on what i consumed: 4 gin and tonics, 4 or 5 whiskey and cokes, a shot of vodka, braaaaandy!, annnnd like 6 or 7 shots of tequila.  dang. I'm missing half my bottom eyelashes in one eye via roman candle war. Mike had to go to the hospital because he busted his chin up prettty bad. It was fun hanging out with my best friends again. bastards spreading out across texas. lets see what else happened... Mike, Chris, Elliott and I were, I guess mistaken for being SigEps? whatever. Winedale people are tools. Appearently I sat down and was in a conversation and me and another guy nodded off, but I didn't wake up. And everyone thought I was dead? And checkd my breathing a few times? I woke up this morning on the floor in between a living room and a kitchen. And have no recollection of drunk dialing. Good night I must say, minus mike chris and elliott leaving to go to the hospital.  And hangovers are for pussies. Round 2 whose down?"

You think after I left the room that  it might have been a clue as to this shit pisses me off. Or maybe yall dont care. Too uptigh you say? No. I get this shit nearly everyday.

What do I need? I need some change, easier said than done. SOme people might think  boo fucking hoo kai look at all the things you have... guess what most of it is just materialistic crap, and most of that is ubeer hand me down. But kai your family is stil together you get a long with them... most of my life my parents have been more freidns than parents, not always exaclty there for me, but I am not playing the blame game.  Its my life and I pretty much fucking destroyed it. Fuck pity, I don't want pity, I don't want sympathy. It doesn't do me anygood, it doesn't do you anygood. So what the fukl ever.

NOOOOOOOOOOOO

LOS ANGELES - Actor Pat Morita, whose portrayal of the wise and dry-witted Mr. Miyagi in ""The Karate Kid"" earned him an Oscar nomination, has died. He was 73.

<img  src=""http://us.news3.yimg.com/us.i2.yimg.com/p/ap/20051125/capt.ny10911251507.obit_morita_ny109.jpg"">

Morita died Thursday at his home in Las Vegas of natural causes, said his wife of 12 years, Evelyn. She said in a statement that her husband, who first rose to fame with a role on ""Happy Days,"" had ""dedicated his entire life to acting and comedy.""

In 1984, he appeared in the role that would define his career and spawn countless affectionate imitations. As Kesuke Miyagi, the mentor to Ralph Macchio's ""Daniel-san,"" he taught karate while trying to catch flies with chopsticks and offering such advice as ""wax on, wax off"" to guide Daniel through chores to improve his skills.

Morita said in a 1986 interview with The Associated Press he was billed as Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita in the film because producer Jerry Weintraub wanted him to sound more ethnic. He said he used the billing because it was ""the only name my parents gave me.""

He lost the 1984 best supporting actor award to Haing S. Ngor, who appeared in ""The Killing Fields.""

For years, Morita played small and sometimes demeaning roles in such films as ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" and TV series such as ""The Odd Couple"" and ""Green Acres."" His first breakthrough came with ""Happy Days,"" and he followed with his own brief series, ""Mr. T and Tina.""

""The Karate Kid,"" led to three sequels, the last of which, 1994's ""The Next Karate Kid,"" paired him with a young Hilary Swank.

Morita was prolific outside of the ""Karate Kid"" series as well, appearing in ""Honeymoon in Vegas,"" ""Spy Hard,"" ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" and ""The Center of the World."" He also provided the voice for a character in the Disney movie ""Mulan"" in 1998.

Born in northern California on June 28, 1932, the son of migrant fruit pickers, Morita spent most of his early years in the hospital with spinal tuberculosis. He later recovered only to be sent to a Japanese-American internment camp in Arizona during World War II.

""One day I was an invalid,"" he recalled in a 1989 AP interview. ""The next day I was public enemy No. 1 being escorted to an internment camp by an FBI agent wearing a piece.""

After the war, Morita's family tried to repair their finances by operating a Sacramento restaurant. It was there that Morita first tried his comedy on patrons.

Because prospects for a Japanese-American standup comic seemed poor, Morita found steady work in computers at Aerojet General. But at age 30 he entered show business full time.

""Only in America could you get away with the kind of comedy I did,"" he commented. ""If I tried it in Japan before the war, it would have been considered blasphemy, and I would have ended in leg irons. ""

Morita was to be buried at Palm Green Valley Mortuary and Cemetery.

He is survived by his wife and three daughters from a previous marriage."

Spurts every now and then. Most of it has actually been a facade. I'm not happy. I'n not happy with who I have become or where I am now. There is no one else to blam eother than me. Sure thigns could have been different but here I am. I feel  too far gone from me. I feel disconnected from what matters and what doesn't. I have clout my worl with so much useless crap, alot of it trying to make myself seeem happier about who I am, its backfired. Sure people think my life is great as it is now, compared to some people it can be seen that way, but the majority of the people only see one side of me. I'm not saying i""m bipolaror anytihng or twofaced. Just that I've made compromise after compromise after compromise which has lead me down the path and into the ruts I'm in now.  So I am going to disconnect from the world for a while, so I can reconnect with myself. THis will be my last entry for a while, not that anybody really reads this shit anyways. So yeah I'm getting off for a while, whether I come and read anyone elses journals or my own is beyond me right now. So off I go can it be done? set a target date? fuck if i knnow maybe my 19th birthday, and if you don't know that well. good for me. So lets see if I can accomplish what the phoenix does, burst into flames, to be reborn form the ashes. here comes the heat..."

"event","there are places I go to think. These places played a big part in growing up. I never really had that many friends so these places were kinda like friends I guess. But I go there to these places and it takes me way back. It takes me to when times were simpler, things were better for me, better for everyone. Am I living in the past? I don't think I am. But I go to these places to escape, and it seems more and more often I need to escape.  Maybe I need to escape permenantly. But where would I go? What would I do? I think about that but then think about now and here, where am I going in life and what am I going to do? No one really knows, and I think not knowing is bettter than having your whole life planed out ahead of you. Spontaniety is a big part of being alive. I don't think I am afraid of committment, but I don't like to get tied down to  things that seem trivial cough school cough I'm afraid I'll miss out on better things and more fun things. For whats the point in living if you can't feel alive? I don't know, I guess the time spnet slaving either in work, or school, or whatever will be worht it in the long run, for a better future. But what is the future? I see a lot of potential in things but there are so many other forces that sem they are going to bring everythign else down.  Things are different. I want to go back to a simpler time, but that is impossible, everything is getting more complicated and more convoluted. What happens when enouggh is enough, too much? It will enevitably happen sooner or later. Well I am off to slave in a classroom or two, but afterwards I will go to one of these places, sit, watch, think, remember..."

"event","Probably one of the best nights I have had in a long time. Fuck yeah. So I parked literally 150 feet away from the Music Hall, and the parking attendant kinda forgot to come up to me and collect money, so free parking. I forgot that Unwritten Law was the first act, they were too bad at all. Next up was Papa Roach. Damn, that guy has a lot of enery, or was on speed, same difference. They played the one song I wanted them to play and then all of their other stuff. ANd then 311 came on. THis was my 5th time to see them, number 4 at the music hall. Well it was beter than the other times ive sen them. Eventhough I went alone (thanks fucktards) I still had a lot of fun.  Definately hurt my neck from nodding/headbanging/jumping/swaying and combinations of those.  They played alot of the good stuff and then a couple songs from their new album which I still have yet to go buy. So goot the chills almost the entire time. I love it. Afer the concert, I was kinda deaf. THe fucking bass, holy shit, stongest its beeen at any concert ive been to. Sweet. Anywho, through constant text messaging form Mike and Chris I found out Texas won, another high point. Well after the concert I went and chilled at Codys. But I wasnt exactly chill. I was on an adenaline high, that might explain me weaving down mopac as fast as the pink beast would go, and spilling my coke everywhere. I was in such a ""I don't give a fuck"" mood I left my sunroof and drivers side window all the way down... Yeah woke up at 930 and there was a lake inside my car. Oh well.  Codys was pretty awesome I was prety thirstty and kinda downed 3 beers in about 5 minutes. Swang on the hammock, got beamed in the face by my own cellphone(thanks Jimeno) and got drunk. And proceeded to pass out on the couch, or maybe it was futon this time. Well anyways best night I've had in a long fuckin time.  SO this mrnign when I was driving home I had an epiphany(sp?) And that would be that I am pretty sure I want to do rally racing. I've always loved it, unlike a shit load of fuckin tools on the godddamn bandwagon. It was so much fun driving in the rain, wipers on full deep puddle after dep puddle flyin down Vega somewhere around 70. So yeah I think after I do the Jetta I might look into geting an old golf and possibly dropping a VR6 into it. Hokay well I think I've droned on long enough. You fuckers missed out on a great fucking concert.tools. peace"

Work seems to always run late now, I never know when I get off, its anywhere form 5 to 8. The money is great, minus the fact that I have so many bills/debts. I'm learning alot oabout building shit and how to fix things which will  be useful wherever I go in life but its so fucking exhausting, day after day. bleh. I'm always fucking sore, always fucking tired. As soon as I get home I jump into the shower and then find something for dinner.  Lesving me about 4 hours of free time. cool. not.  So I get to hangout with friends but only for a couple of hours. I haven't ben able to really party much because I'd rather not die on the jobsite. A bunch of my friends are leaving and I basicaly have no time to hangout with them before they leave. arg. Well I have to go drive on my spare for another 50 miles today ue to the fact that every tire place is usuallt closed when I get home. And I havent been able to call my bank to get my routingnumber for  my new eBay account. Fuck I just want a long ass vacation or quit or something.

"event","There are two Mexicans who have been lost in the desert for weeks and they're at death's door. As they stumble on, hoping for salvation in the form of an oasis or something similar, they suddenly spy, through the heat haze, a tree off in the distance. 

As they get closer they can see that the tree is draped with rasher upon rasher of bacon. There's smoked bacon, crispy bacon, life giving juicy nearly- raw bacon, all sorts. 

""Hey, Pepe"" says the first bloke ""Ees a bacon tree! We're saved!"" 

""You're right, amigo!"" says Pepe. So Pepe goes on ahead and runs up to the tree salivating at the prospect of food. But as he gets to within five feet of the tree, there's the sound of machine gun fire, and he is shot down in a hail of bullets. 

His friend quickly drops down on the sand and calls across to the dying Pepe. 

""Pepe! Pepe! Que pasa, hombre?"" 

With his dying breath Pepe calls out, ""Ugh, run, amigo, run! Ees not a Bacon Tree! Ees a... Ees a..."" 

""Yes, Pepe? Ees a what..?"" 

""Ees... a... ham bush."""

In a few weeks, cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketing companies and you will start to receive sale calls. You will be charged minutes for these calls. 

Call this number from your CELL phone 888-382-1222. It is the national DO NOT CALL list. It only takes a minute and it blocks your number for 5 years. 

It would be a kindness to pass this on to everyone you know who doesn't want to be hassled. I just did, it's easy!

Woke up this morning and it seemed to me, 
that every night turns out to be 
A little more like Bukowski. 
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read. 
But God who'd wanna be? 
God who'd wanna be such an asshole? 
God who'd wanna be? 
God who'd wanna be such an asshole? 

Well we sat on the edge of the river, 
the crowd screamed, ""Sacrifice the liver!"" 
If God takes life, he's an Indian giver. 
So tell me now why, you'll tell me never. 
Who would wanna be? 
Who would wanna be such a control freak? 
Well who would wanna be? 
Who would wanna be such a control freak? 

Well see what you wanna see. You should see it all.
Well take what you want from me. You deserve it all.
Nine times out of ten our hearts just get dissolved.
Well I want a better place or just a better way to fall.

But one time out of ten, everything is perfect for us all. 
Well I want a better place or just a better way to fall. 
Here we go! 

If God controls the land and disease, 
keeps a watchful eye on me, 
If he's really so damn mighty, 
my problem is I can't see, 
well who would wanna be? 
Who would wanna be such a control freak? 
Well who would wanna be? 
Who would wanna be such a control freak? 

Evil home stereo, what good songs do you know? 
Evil me, oh yeah I know, what good curves can you throw? 

Well all that icing and all that cake, 
I can't make it to your wedding, but I'm sure I'll be at your wake. 
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day, 
when you get to the point make sure that I'm still awake, OK? 

Went to bed and didn't see 
why every day turns out to be 
a little bit more like Bukowski. 
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read. 
But God who'd wanna be? 
God who'd wanna be such an asshole?"

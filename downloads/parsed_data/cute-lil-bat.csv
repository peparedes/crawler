"event","<b>I Am A:</b> Neutral Good Elf Ranger Fighter
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Neutral Good</b> characters believe in the power of good above all else. They will work to make the world a better place, and will do whatever is necessary to bring that about, whether it goes for or against whatever is considered 'normal'.
<br><br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Elves</b> are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.
<br><br><u>Primary Class:</u><br><b>Rangers</b> are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.
<br><br><u>Secondary Class:</u><br><b>Fighters</b> are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.
<br><br><u>Deity:</u><br><b>Mielikki</b> is the Neutral Good goddess of the forest and autumn. She is also known as the Lady of the Forest, and is the Patron of Rangers. Her followers are devoted to nature, and believe in the positive and outreaching elements of it. They use light armor, and a variety of weapons suitable for hunting, which they are quite skilled at. Mielikki's symbol is a unicorn head.

"event","so this guy comes into my store yesterday with a broken xbox that he bought from us a year ago.  with the receipt he only has a 90 day in store waranty..  but we offer everyone year long extended waranties.  sadly, we can't fix sysstems at my store, but i know a great place that can.. so i write down the address and phone number of the shop all the while explaining how wonderful it is and that they should be able to fix it for a reasonable price.  the guy took the paper with the information on it from me.. and threw it at me.  ...merry christmas.  
working at the museum has gotten better.  i like it a lot more now.  ... if only they'd pay me...  >_>  i guess that's all for now.  later!

there's a couple museums i'd like to go to. field has a cool dinosaur thing going on, and science and industry has the bodies and a video game deally happening.  zoos are always a great place to go.  but again.. i need money.  yea.. ok.. later

"event","well, work turned out to be pretty fun today, so that's cool :)  there were a few.. changes at my store so we had some extra help come in.  the guy i closed with tonight was really cool too bad he was only helping out for a couple days.  let's see.. oh yea, i went to the sheep/pigface show the other night with mike.  *laughs*  i had to drag him kicking and screaming.. but i think he had a good time (correct me if i'm wrong).  we definately have a silly story to tell hehe.. so a huge thanks goes out to Charles Levi without him i would have completely missed the show and wasted my money.  the sheep seemed to be in a better mood this time than the first time i saw them lol.  in other news.. (yet still random!) i started playing Final Fantasy VII again.  man i love that game.  i probably won't get a chance to play it again till after work on sunday though :(  i am, of course, very excited about the upcoming movie, Advent Children.. September!! wee!  i'm totally getting the action figures when they're at gamestop.  >^.^< 
and again.. i leave you with pictures of silliness..

"event","well, the anime convention is now over  *sigh*  sad really.. but next year i think i might go all 3 days.. maybe even get a hotel room.  i think i'll have a different costume for each day as well.  so far i'm thinking i'll bring the Redmage costume for a comeback for friday, saturday will be a mithra in full RSE (final fantasy xi), and sunday i'll go as Morrigan (Dark Stalkers).  but who knows, the convention is a full year away.. i may change my mind.  but what i do know is i had a lot of fun this year, and my costume was an even bigger success than i thought it would be.  i'm trying to see if there's another convention in/near chicago this summer, if there is.. i'm totally going!  
*laughs*  yet another Sheep/Pigface show is coming up.  so of course.. i'll be there.  it's on sunday.. not exactly sure who's going to that yet.  and lastly, i'm still determined to make my way to london.  the idea of 2 rachels in england is just to inviting to ignore.  lol  who knows what kind of trouble we'll get ourselves into.  :p  alright, that's all for now.. i'm freezing so i think i'm gonna try to warm up.. and read for awhile."

"event","i am seriously attempting to go to england for 5 days to a week some time in september.  i think i'm gonna go to a travel agency on tuesday to get some information about it.  so far i'm thinking.. clubbing and phantom of the opera (and of course the various Beatles locations).  unfortunately.. i don't know if it'll happen because my job pays close to nothing :(  but.. hey.. it doesn't hurt to look into it.  i bet shopping is pretty cool there too.. 

on another note.. i've decided that there are tons of video games i want.. but i'll never be able to afford!  one i'm definately getting though got traded in the other day, Darkstalkers 3 wee!  it's 14.99 though, so i have to wait awhile before picking it up.                                                                                                                                   most the other games i want are for the gamecube (i need more games for that system)  smash bros, paper mario, killer 7, and ailien hominid would all be most welcomed.  as far as the PS2 goes.. lego star wars and there's a game coming out called Haunting Grounds that seems fun.  i'll just leave that list there for anyone that's feeling generous to look over... *cough Mike cough*  (if you're reading this, mike... lego and paper come first!)  

let's see...  i really need to go out more, so i can actually have things to write about in this thing lol. the convention is now 2 weeks away!  the costume is coming along wonderfully.  i'm a little worried about the hat though.. lol  but i'm sure i'll figure something out.   ok.. i'm gonna stop writing before everyone falls asleep while reading.  lol.. i promise one day.. i'll have something important to say. 

                                                                   ^*^"

"event","The anime convention fast approaches (yup i fully plan to be one of those dorks) my costume is coming alone nicely.. if only i could shake off the lazy and get to work on it so i can finish it.  i'm going to work on the cloak tomorrow, should get it all done except for the extras.. ie the trim and clasps and such.  the next step is then the hat.. yikes!  never made a hat before.. first time for everything..   after that it'll be smooth sailing.  just hemming and lil extras, and we can't forget to make my plastic sword look metal.  

~Anyway~

i sent some more resumes and aps to the Field Museum.  gift shop and volunteer.... yea.. there's a good use of a bio degree..  oh well.  i'm thinking of maybe taking some photography classes.. be like a freelance nature photographer.  thought that might be fun.  
i'm just realizing how odd this LJ deals are..  kind of weird.. why am i telling you people all this stuff lol  *shrugs*  

aawww..

been a mess lately.  my marni died last tuesday.  for those of you that don't know, she is my dog and my best friend.  maybe that sounds silly to some of you.. but she was the one individual that was always there for me, no matter what.  she listened.. and i know she understood.  i came home from work or school or just from being with friends.. she'd greet me at the door.. tail wagging :)  i miss her..  and i can't seem to get used to the fact that she isn't here.  i expect her to be there when i leave my room.  i have to stop myself from tossing pizza crust on the floor (she loved the crust!!)  the list goes on.. and so do the tears and the hurt.  she's been with the family since i was 5..  i didn't even get to say goodbye.. she died while i was asleep..  i woke up the next morning at 6 to my mom in my room.. she only said my name.. but i knew what she was going to say..   i miss her...."

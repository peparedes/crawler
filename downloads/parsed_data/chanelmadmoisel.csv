ok so today was like i felt effing crappy but heres how it went down

ahh rotation 5, i had math first and i hate it with a hardcore passion! i got a B- on my test so its all good, o ya and the kid that sits behind me pisses me off i swear every 2 minutes he makes this noise that sounds like hes hawking a loogy

english we had to do DOL races, ya we lost

snack, i skipped it lol

history, we presented our project with out polyracial (greek root word!) group and since half of our group doesnt speak english, they read the whole thing in spanish and it was boring, then we had to grade our group and i gave my entire group and A and ximena gave me a C because she thought i was giving her a bad grade and i was like wtf

science, omg i didnt get in trouble, but drew and john piss me the hell off, they take my lunch (at least they didnt put it in the trash) and took stuff, they glued my pencil and then took it and everything i say they twist it around and im just trying to ignore them because i get in big trouble in that class and my mom flips, but we have fish eggs now...yay

lunch, boring sorta today, me erin stacy courtney kim and macarea played tic tac toe!

drama, break out the cristal...fo nothin

PE, PE pumped me up so much, its our last game of ultimate frisbe and we had to play sarah and haileys team! :(  but we kicked ass and i scored 2 goals and got a bounus point so now i can get all fives!!!!!!!

came home and watched i love the 90's

then erin came over and we watched it and mad tv and ate pizza, then we went outside and skated down the hill beacuse my house is like on this mountain, then we were gonna write our names in the sidewalk but it was hard and some guy beeped at us, so i did it later, we played frisbe, then we walked down to her house and we were walking through the huge park and this guy pulled in and just parked there and his car was all dark and we had to walk right by it so i thought he was gonna shoot us or something so i was like ahh rape defense, then me and erin chilled and watched tv and looked at pictures of her friends then i came home and just went online..

ahh fridays

oh yeah and i think i have mono...i feel really weak and this kid dakota had it at school...no i dont think i have it..i know..jk

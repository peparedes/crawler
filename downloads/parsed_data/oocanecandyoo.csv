"event","Kari, if your reading this, will you tell me a couple of things about livejournal???

1. How do I get rid of that ad thingy on the right!?!?!?!
2. Tell me some people's livejournals!!! (I think adams has one...lol)

Anyway, not much to say today...my mom is still painting the bonus room, but now she's repainting the ceiling white...even though it already was white...oi vey...sometimes she confuses me. I am going to be getting a facebook and a myspace soon...It's going to be hell trying to keep up with all of my websites...besides the ones up top in the links section, I also have another xanga the one I created secretly while I was ""gone,"" a freeweb, a bravenet, 4 other neopets accounts...oi vey...(again)

OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!!
i almost bought DDR Max Revolution 2 at target today!!! Heck Yes!!! It came with a mat and everything for only $60!!! If i save up my allowance from this month, & combine it with my birthday money, then I should be able to have it before the summer ends, maybe even before July if I work fast...I still don't have a job...oh well...I gave up on that a while ago...lol...

Well, that's about all the ranting I can do at the moment..."

"event","Well, basically, this is where I will post the same entries that are on my Xanga, but it is alot easier for a lot of my friends if I have a livejournal, also...

So, not much to talk about really...I had a convo with kari on yahoo today, we had a in-depth disscussion about how she needed a sexy Italian Stripper in her life...alas, so do I at the moment...

I took a break from my regular life and spent the day reading slash-ee-full-goodness. I don't know why, but I've suddenly been reminded of the posse inside joke ""Queen Ami-Daly""
Do you guys remember that? Good times, Good times...

I am talking to anets at the moment on yahoo...lol

I suddenly have the strange and deep desire to put on a slutty Santa-Themed stripper costume with velvet red stilletto's, and dance around at Kari's last halloween party whispering the words ""Ness Pa?"" seductively into their ears...

*sighs* if only life could be like that every day...

i wan't someone to hold me, more now than ever before...

More to come, I promise!

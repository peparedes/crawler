Nothing really exiting has happened, i've been seeing much more of my boy scince he got his license, been comin up here, and meeting in the middle more. good fun. Lots of double dates with Emily and Karl.  good stuff, amusing conversations and situations (the blazer, the blue beast, high octane and big dub diesl, the drive in, westfield fair, and so much more to come right guys?!) um....... i guess thats it...

Volleyball is starting up again, try outs are on the 26 (Happy Birthday Alison!!!) and i have no idea what is going to happen. Sean (the coach) has changed things up a bit so if i dont make varsity (which i think is more likely than every one else) i probly wont make jv either. fun stuff... should be interesting!

I went to a mud volleyball thing on sat (the 21) that benifited the Elipsy Foundation of Conn. it was soo much fun, i didnt play because for some reason you have to be 18, but it was alot of fun watching my uncle and his team play. 
woot

well i guess thats it, luv ya'll

i am soo fucking pissed right now, i jsut found out that my uncle's cd realease party, which ive eben exited about now for like 3months is fucking 21 and over... they had no idea up until like 2:30 today, tis bull shit. all the planning ive done to get sam there, and my parents tehre is now down the fucking tube. i cant believe this. my parents are still going to go but idk what im gonna do now. i have no place to stay or any thing. i could stay at my grandparents but woohoo what fun that will be, or i could stay at ""christines"" house (aka sam's house) and since sam's mom is gone i could just stay there, i would but hes probly having his party now, and sry i dont wanna stay over when a bunch of drunk guys are gonna be there as well. not exactly what i had planned for when i stayed over his house.... idk what to do, maybe i could stay over kita's house or something... idk, id like to stay on westfield, but my dad would have to meet mas/christine's parents b4 i did, and that would kinda ruin the whole kimmie stays over sam's house but i already explained y that wont happen....
 i just want to... die, get it over with... im so sick of all this shit, i'm slowly losing it day by day, minute after minute. chillin with my friends is cool, and some tiems gets my mind off of my problems, when im with sam, usually every thing is better, true it doesnt go away completely, but he can just make every thing better, im so afraid to lose him... but some tiems i feel like he would be better off with out me dragging him down... this entire week has sucked, sucked huge cock. for one thing this entire week just dragged on and on, i thought it would never end, and just whan i get to fri. this happens. idk what to do. its like the littlest thing has set me off, and idk how to counter it. i want to drink, but i know that if i do, im just gonna get worse... maybe emily is right, maybe i am becomeing an alcoholic... i cant to i dont drink that much. 
its like a part of me has been torn out. i feel so empty inside these days. barely any thing can pick me up, and im sick of things the way they are. i need a change, i just dont know what to change. i wish ioculd just disapear, and go some where where im not hurting my friends, or any one for that matter. i wish i wasnt such a bitch all the time and i could be more faithful to every one. i wish the littlest thigns didnt set me off, and i wish i kept in contact with some of the people that i see on a adaily basis but never talk to.... im not sure what to do with myself any more... i need to get out.... out of this town, out of my head, maybe i need a freash start, go to a enw school, get into the crowd that i've always wanted to be part of... im not saying that the friends i have now are bad, i love u guys, ive just always seen myself, some where else... idk any more, idk what to think. or do or IDK im so sick of not knowing....
its weird i try and picture what my life will be like in the future, but nothing comes to mind, maybe im just destined to die and early death... but who cares any way?

"event","i stayed after on fri. so mrs. varnon could look at som eof my poetry, she read my second rape poem, all she said was ""tahts sick"" i found out that when she read ""secrets"" she thought i was actualy raped, she wanted to talk with about baout it and stuff, but never did. i guess it bothered for awhile too... idk, im kinda proud of my rape poems. any way, she did alot of correcting and stuff, and made them better which was really cool, cause most of the people who i show them too cant correct them and tell me how to make it better. anyway, it was really hanging out withe rher suprosingly, i dont like her class very much, btu she is an awsome person! we talked about her wedding, and her childhood, her growing up etc. i found out alot about her that i never would have guessed. it was cool, it was almost like we were friends. then i got to read some of her stuff, it was fun

im realyl worried about some of my friends, idk what they are going to do in the next week or so... i wanna talk to them about it, but it would be relaly awkward, and one of them isnt here. 
do i worry too much?

i cant wait for the fishing derby 2morow, its gonna be much fun chilin with sam, karl, and who ever else is going. i guess a bunch of sam;s family is going, so that should be fun (they are so chill). then i get to go to his baseball game, which shoudl be pretty exiting, he told me about his last one where he made like tons of awsome plays and shit, i hope he does it again so i can be like ""yay for sam!"" and give hima big kiss and embarass him in front of his team (angel face) 

i need to go shopping, im running out of summer cloths, besides the fact that most of them are from 7th grade. but i dont wanna go shopping cause thats wasting alot of $$ i dont need shorts, i need like shirts and crap. it would be really nice if my dad could win like 10,000 $$s then my mom could get the new wardrob that she needs cause every thing is either really old, or toooo big (im so proud of her, shes dropped like 4 sizes, yay for mommy!!) and i can get my shirts, and daddy can get the cloths that he needs

im still having problems breathing... not very often or any thing, but idk. i guess i can deal with it, ya know?

i had a good talk with emily yesterday about dana.. i understand wehre she is coming from more concerning him... i still ahve my views on it..but i have to look at it from her point of view, what if this was sam and i?? its gonna take me years to get over that kid, i just wish i could help her... but idk what to do...

im so happy daddy put a new mother board in my comp in my room, and every thing, and now its soooo mcuh faster! yay! that thing crawled, ask.. ian or jackie or maybe emily, it was like discustingly slow, lol

any one wana do some thing 2night? call me im realy bored which is probly why this thing is so long... 

alright ill stop
luv

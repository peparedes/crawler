Emerald Downs was really fun, Dia Julia and i almost won $300!! but then me and Dia thought that we should bet on a different horse, that really sucked. Sam (Jesse Roth's friend) is really funny, and its so cool that he goes to school with Josie and Emma. Emma you were finally on last night!! god that took a while.. ok well i got to go, bye.

OMG the boat was soo much fun! it was huge,i think tim said it costed FIVE MILLION DOLLARS! there were two small bedrooms and one master bedroom, and each on got it's own marble bathroom! i swear the showers on the boat were bigger then the ones i have in my house.  and there was a maid, a cook, a server, a captain and someone who drove us around on a little boat, and they all had uniforms. i definetly could get used to living like that. it was sad when mattt, luke and tim had to go, but since tim just can't get enough of my mom, he's gonna be back here on thursday, hmm lets see that's how many days they have to be apart? well friday, so thats one, but then my mom flew down to California on saturday and comes back on tuesday...so they will be apart for a WHOLE 3 DAYS! THAT'S 72 LONG HOURS! god they can't stay away from eachother, it's so annoying but his kids are fun. luke is soo funny, ""eat this hommie"" i can't belive that Stephen didn't kill him for that, even i would have hit him if he did that to me.  haha but it was soo funny. i think luke is a homiphobic (did i spell that right?) omg and he always lies, it's so funny, he lies about the stupidest things. i have to admit that i can't wait to see luke on thursday, and im sad that matt and haley are in france so they can't come, oh well, luke will keep the house from being quiet... hehe, well i'm gonna go cuz my sister is dying to get on the computer.

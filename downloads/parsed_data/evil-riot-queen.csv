"event","Dammit, I fucking hate life.  The AFI show is sold out.  I can't beleive it.  I FINALLY get a chance to see one of my favorite bands live, and now I cant.  If my goddam parents havent taken so friggen long to say I could go, maybe I'd be seeing them.  It's so frustrating that they are going to be here, but I cant see them.

My parents always do this to me.  First Warped Tour, now this.

I never have anything to be happy about, I'm never excited or happy.  Then AFI comes here, and I get all excited that I can go, and I'm actually happy for once.  Which makes it even worse that now I haveta miss them."

Right...So my dad tells me that I get to go, but I haveta bring a cell and call them often, I have to get my own food and drinks (duh!  he thinks I dont know about date rape drugs.  im not an idiot.), and I cant go backstage (like I would get to anyway?).  Those rules should be easy enough to follow.
I am so not gonna sleep at all until after the concert.  
I'm going with Manny, and maybe Nikki.  I can't get through to Manny on the phone though...i just hope I can get tickets before they sell out."

"event","Wow.  I was so spazzy last night.  I had like, a mental break down and started crying all over the place.

Right...I just read my last entry, and I have come to a conclusion:  I think too much.  I over-analyse.  Yup.  So Ive decided that I'm gonna stop that.  GC is still my favorite band...noone ever said you can only have one favorite, right?  So Silverchair, GC, AFI, and Rancid are all my fave bands.

Im getting a new journal soon...the name evil_riot_queen is starting to piss me off, its so cliche.  So I'll be getting the new one soon.

That's about it...I haveta go to school opening mass tomorrow.  ugh."

Dont worry, I'm not over my GC obsession or anything, I still love them to death, but lately I've been more able to listen to other bands.  So yeah...now I'm GC, Silverchair, Rancid and AFI obsessive.  I have too much time on my hands.

I feel like crap.

I'm still trying to get my 'rents to let me go to AFI...I'll just DIE if they dont let me.

I feel wierd right now...Ive been obsessed with GC for years...I feel like Im losing interest in them...i dont want to, I still love them...I just dont know what Im feeling right now.  They;re still one of my favorites, but Im not sure that they are my absolute favorite...Its hard to say that...Because I feel like Im betraying someone or something...  I dunno.  I think I just need to sleep, my head's starting to hurt."

"event","Is it just me, or did they change LiveJournal?  The layout's different.

Anyways, moving on...

Right, so this guy in my class, Im still not gonna name, is SO SEXY.  For real.  He's so hot it makes me wanna puke.  And I have to deal with that for 6 hours everyday, for the rest of the year!  He'll never like me.  He probably notices me, because I'm hard not to motice, but he'd never go for me.

Im still all depressed.  At home, everything is making me cry.  Not at school, because I never let them see me cry.  But at home, I just completely lose it.  Today, I flicked to MuchMusic, and ""Youth of the Nation"" by P.O.D was playing, and I started bawling, for no reason at all.

I didnt sleep again last night...Im so mentally tired, its not even funny.

I'm thinking of making my journal friends only, just because school has started again...Just in case someone I know comes across it.  I'd be so embarrassed.  I know it's paranoid, but still.  People laugh at me enough without reading all this.  If you're on my friends list, dont worry, I wont take you off.  I just have to find someone who will make me a pretty Friends Only banner.

Alright, thats about it."

"event","Right, so today was the second day.  

We got our options...I'm in art and french, which is okay, I guess.  Atleast I'm not in world geography or leadership or extra gym.

It was actually pretty uneventful.  I was just alone, and I just did what I had to do to get through the day.  I dont know how long I can do that, though...I just felt so empty.  My so-called friend Anoushka is still acting like I dont exist...she's not mad at me, but she just picks the ""popular kids"" over me, even though they dont like her.

Yeah...so, I have CTS tomorrow, so I get to listen to music on the bus.  Im sitting alone, thats okay...I'll have all my boys (all of GC, Rancid, AFI and more) with me:)

There's this guy in my class, who will remain unnamed, who is SO HOT!  I mean hoooot.  He has the most gorgeous eyes (well, not THE most georgeous, that'd be Billy), and this great smile.  He's so funny.  Too bad I'm ugly and everyone hates me.  He probably doesnt even notice I exist.

All this shit, added to the fact that I'm not sleeping.  I literally think im an insomniac.  I can't sleep for more that half an hour at a time, and thats only every once in a while.  So every night, I sleep a grand total of about 2 hours.  And It just makes me even more tired of life.  I mean, how I can I run on that? 

This is all wearing me down, and I've only been back to school for two days.  How the hell am I going to make it through the whole year?

God, I hate life."

"event","So today was the first day of grade nine.  Here we go...

Well, first of all, I'm in mr. davis' class.  He seems nice, but I really wanted Ms. Wade.  

I have noone in my class, except Anoushka, but she doesnt count.  I mean, she talks to me all the time at home and on the phone, but whenever there are other people around, she completely ignores me...like she's embarrassed to know me or something.  She didnt say a thing to me all day.

The guy I had a big crush on last year is in my class.  I dont like him anymore...but still.

I just feel like such a loser, because I didnt talk to anyone, and noone talked to me, unless we had to.  People just dont like me.  

There's this guy in my class who I think's really hot.  I dont know him that well, though, so I can't say i have a crush on him, I just think he's hot.  But it'd never happen anyways, because he's friends with poeple who dont like me.

My dad says I need to be more positive, or nothing good will happen to me.  He says if i think positive, people will wanna be around me or whatever.  Personally, for me, I think that being positive is like getting your hopes up, and just sets you up for a bigger fall when things dont go the way you want.

God, I just feel so sick.  I'm sick of life.  If I had the guts, I'd kill myself.  But I'm too chicken-shit.   So I just have to live with it.  It's hard.  And it hurts...but I cant fix it."

"event","Right, so tomorrow's the first day of school.  I couldnt eat thinking about it, and I know I wont sleep tonight.  School is like hell for me.  I have to spend six and a half hours locked in a building where everyone hates me, I have to obey rules, do tests, work all day, and then come home and do homework.  If I had just one person who could be my friend, and stay by me, I think it would be alright.  Just one person to care about me, and to make me feel special and needed, someone to cheer me up, I would be fine.  But I dont.  I have noone.  And even though I'm used to it, that doesnt mean I'm content with it.

People dont understand me.  I know this sounds cliche, but its true.  They think that because I listen to punk rock, and I show it, I'm a punk, and a loser...which isnt fair, because Im not a punk, and even if I was, what's so wrong with that?  They think that just because Im a bit different, I dont want to have a friend.  And they dont bother to get to know me, because of what other people would think.

Im sick of being alone.  And I think that, even though I dont show it, its starting to get to me. 

So here we go again, another year that, no matter what I do, will just end up being the same as the rest."

She showed up acting all nice.  yeah, right.  And I swear, her bra was SO padded...for real.  Like, I dont really care, but you could TELL they were stuffed.  She's not good at it, the tissue paper was all bumpy.  rotflmao.

Listened to the Rancid CD some more...I was listening to that song about Brody...sad.  ""If you lose me girl, you lose a good thing""... he can say THAT again!  Why anyone would ever leave Tim Armstrong is beyond me.

I made some of my own icons!  They suck, but atleast they're mine.  One is billy and daniel, one is Tim Armstrong, and one is just Billy.  All of them are animated.

I watched some movie last night...I have NO idea what it was, it was old...but there was this kid, probably my age, with long hair, and he was HOT!  

Tonight I'm watching TLOTR The Two Towers.

Thats about it.  Yeah.

"event","So...I got the new Rancid CD today.  it came with a Rancid shirt (one that i didnt already have, yay!) and a Rancid patch.  It's really good...not their best CD, but still awsome.  I love ""Indestructible"", its an awsome some, I love the words ""through music we can live forever"", because thats exactly my view.  And they say in the booklet that that song is for the Ramones, and in the song, it refers to Joe Strummer, and that just makes the song even better.

OMFG!  There are three really great bands coming here: No Use For A Name, Godsmack and finger eleven.  I wanna go to them all, but that wont happen, so I'm thinking I'll just go to No Use For A name, because they're the band I like most out of those three.  Now I just haveta convince my mom to let me go, and find someone to go with.  This wont be easy, because my mom is really overprotective, and because noone likes me enoguh to come with me:)

Yep, thats about it...yeah, it is.

I have family that lives about a 15 minute drive away from there.  If my parents would let me, I could go and stay with them and then go see it.  But they wont let me, so that idea is down the drain.

To make it worse, I just got an email from gc.com that gave me the password to get presale tickets for that show.  It just reminded me of it, and now Im even more depressed.

"event","I'm hella bored.  Manny's at work, so I cant do anything with her right now.  I need to get a job.  But I dont know where I could.  I cant work at fast-food places because of my nose ring.  So basically, my only options are to work at places like GAP and Claire's.  Pssshhhh.  Yeah, like that'll happen.  God, I hate those stores.  I should work at Spencer's.  I could LIVE in Spencer's, that store is a riot!
My mom's making a list of chores for me.  Oh, joy.  I get to vaccuum.  How psyched am I?  Not at all.  
I'm really enjoying this claiming thing.  Check my usr info for my list of claims.
I NEED MANNY TO GET HOME SO I CAN DO SOMETHING!
Im booooored.
waaaaaaah.

You know what's so wierd?  yesterday, I was sitting in the car with my family, and I got this urge to start singing ""Salvation"" by Rancid.  So I opened my mouth to sing ""Come on baby, wont you show me what you've got, yeah"" but my brother starts singing it at exactly the same time!  Freaky, huh?  I thought it was.  Lol, my brothers only nine, but he knows all of my favorite songs off by heart because I listen to them so much:)
Yep, thats about it....Thanks again for the icon, hera18!
Peace, Love and GC!

It's someone from Manitoba.  Im pissed off 'cause Im NEVER gonna get to see them!  There's no way they're gonna come here on their fall tour, they never do.  ARG!
Okay, good news:  My order got here today.  I now have a Minor Threat shirt, a Rancid shirt, and a L27 shirt!  I got all excited when it came 'cause I've been waiting SOOOO long for Level27!  i got the batty t-shirt.  You know, the black one with the red bat, the one he wears in TYATH video?  yeah, that one.
MANNY!  I want my CD's back, I miss rancid and The Used.  So can you come over at some point in the next week and give them to me?
Can you see my layout now?  it was all screwed yesterday, but I think I fixed it.
We had such a big hail storm today, i could here it denting my roof, lol.
Anyways, someone comment so Ill have someone to talk to!  HI KIM!
--Peace, Love, and GC!

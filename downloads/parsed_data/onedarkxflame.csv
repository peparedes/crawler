I am exhausted as fuck, but I have another job interview today at Target.  I doubt they will give me what I am asking for; it is a futile attempt to escape from 711.

The nice thing is, I have the next 4 days off.  The not so nice thing is, I just got paid today, paid both credit card bills and a phonebill, and now I'm broke again.

And Brandon called my phone yesterday.  What the fuck?"

I got my septum pierced.  I'd take pictures, only the pincher is tiny so you can't really see it unless you're looking for it anyway.  My dude had to do it twice--he pierced my septum at a 14 and stretched it to a 12, but couldn't get the jewelry in, so he had to stretch it from the other side with a 10.  Ouch.  Not as bad as the nipples though.  It was a spontaneous piercing.  I can't wait until its healed so I can get a cbb for it.

I went to Jroc's house tonight.  The kitten (Rere) fell asleep on me.  I kept trying not to move so he wouldn't wake up.

I want something terribly exciting to happen to me."

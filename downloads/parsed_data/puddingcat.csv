"event","I've just caused a Mexican stretch.  (Which is <a href=""http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/246700.html"">not a racist term</a>, hurrah!  I feared, because of English -> Irish ""jokes"" and a vague memory that US -> Mexican are similar.)

I stretched my foot, because Elsa was lying on it and had surreptitiously rearranged my toes into positions more comfortable for her.

Elsa stretched, presumably because my toes moving without her permission woke her up.

Ripley stretched, because Elsa had stretched and she has too little brainpower to think for herself.

Gambit stretched, because Ripley had stretched into him.

Unfortunately, being touched by one of the girls means PLAYTIME for Gambit. All three of them are now looking rumpled and slightly offended at various points not on the sofa."

"event","I went to see this last night, and it's brilliant.  I'm not a huge Tom Hardy fan (I don't dislike him at all; I love his attitude re Mad Max, but I don't go all weak at the knees) but he was absolutely amazing.

About the only thing that spoiled it for me was getting distracted looking at the 2 sets of makeup used to make each of the twins look subtly different; it was absolutely flawless.  They'd even managed to give them different scars (not from in-film injuries; old, healed ones).

Yes, there's violence; in terms of goriness it's not half as bad as some 15s, but because it's so realistic (i.e. not ridiculous over the top fantasy one-shot-and-they're-dead minimally bloody fantasy style, it's a lot more affecting and very believable.

<lj-cut text=""Spoilers &amp; content warning"">
I came away actually feeling really sorry for Ronnie; he might have been a decent person, were it not for his upbringing Reggie, and his intermittent refusal to take the tablets intended to control his schizophrenia.  (It's unlikely that he'd ever not be violent, I reckon, but it could have been so much less bad than it ended up.)  Meanwhile Reggie came across as the worst sort of charming, charismatic manipulator; more intentionally violent, rather than unable to control his impulses.

There's an off-screen marital rape scene at one point.  It's very brief and, as usual with me, most upsetting because it reminds me how recently that was criminalised.</lj-cut>

I don't think I want it on DVD; it's in no way a fun or feelgood film, so I can't think when I'd feel like rewatching.  That doesn't stop it being very, very good."

Feeling like you're drifting all alone in the once-fun-but-now-too-quiet pool of Livejournal? Not to worry! <lj user=""silviarambles""> is running a friending meme! 

<big><a href=""http://silviarambles.livejournal.com/608800.html"">Friending Meme for LJ Survivors - 2015 Re-edition</a></big>


Please remember that friending frenzies work only if you spread the word, so, even if you're not looking for more friends, would you mind doing me a big favour and pimping the meme on your own journals?

Thanks!

<u>My ETA</u>  The way it works:  The link takes you to <lj user=""silviarambles"">, the host. In the comments, you answer a set of questions (provided).  People read your answers & reply if they want to friend you.  Easy!"

Yes, well, being terrifyingly close to overdosing doesn't get better overnight.  Or in 18 months, apparently.

The upside (laughs hollowly) to getting *so* bad is that I got referred to psychiatric services who immediately leapfrogged me to the top of their ""Holy shit we need to do something"" queue.  I now have a consultant psychiatrist, a psych nurse / care coordinator, and a peer support worker (basically, someone who's been through the system & come out the other side, who now works for the NHS).

Huh. ""NHS"" isn't recognised by spellcheck.  Telling.

I *seem* to have a relatively ok mix of brain drugs, in that I'm not crying messily *every* day & nor do I have anxiety so bad I can't leave the house or eat anything more exciting than spinach (that was a fun fortnight).  I've joined a gym (on a student membership, hurrah for the OU!) so that I can honestly say I'm doing everything I should be doing to get better (adn a bit of me wants to be able to say ""See, I *told* you it wouldn't work"", which is quite disturbing in itself.

I'm still doing the maths, which is going terrifyingly well.  I'm torn between thinking ""100% should *not* be possible!"" and ""But that's really insulting to everyone who didn't get it!"" and ""That's really insulting to everyone who got it!""

Knitting, too, and spinning. They keep my hands busy so I don't damage myself.

Archery, though... Coaching stopped last summer when my coach signed up for another qualification & picked a different guinea pig. This meant my relatively small problems snowballed & have ended up with the whole thing being associated with misery & disappointment; combine that with ongoing anxiety over crowds and I haven't shot for months.  It sucks; so does seeing posts about shooting on my FB feed.

One of the big problems I have is what they call resilience; basically, it takes me several days to recover from the smallest thing going wrong (or even going right, if it involves any confrontation at all).  This is making me avoid doing all sorts of things *in case* they go wrong / someone says something that upsets me / I get disappointed, etc.  The way I described it to Patricia (private therapist, who I still see regularly) is as if there's a load of bowls in front of me;  one has boiling water in & the rest are hand-temperature, and doing the Thing means sticking my hand into one of them.  The number of bowls varies with the perceived risk / degree of fucked-upness that might result.  Clearly, some things are pretty unlikely to have a bad outcome, but if they *do* go wrong / if I pick the wrong bowl to stick my hand into it would be catastrophic.

So I'm doing things like avoid Ultron in case I get disappointed (I wasn't much, but Too Much Tony and Not Enough Cap, which is another dread I have about Civil War. It has all the Avengers => it should be an Avengers film. Cap 3 should be all about Cap & Bucky.  I have Strong Feelings about that.)

(I also have Strong Feelings about Bucky, which should come as no surprise considering that angstmuffin assassins are my kryptonite.)

Anyway, I'm still off work (pretending to be normal for long enough to do anything is exhausting.  Plus, too high a chance of the boiling water.) and getting income protection insurance, which will stop if / when work finds a way of terminating my contract.  Hello, anxiety.

I'm horribly lonely much of the time, which isn't helped by anxiety over people being dicks during my worst few months and really mixes well with ongoing social phobia.  Also, the house is such a state that I hate being in it, but am too overwhelmed to do anything, pretty much, so I don't feel able to invite people round (conversation! Argh! Boiling water!)  As for Actual Relationships, after an attempt last yearish I'm now Utterly Convinced that I'm both undateable and do not have the sort of body that anyone would want as more than a body-temperature fleshlight.

TL;DR: I'm hanging on with my fingernails. I hate being like this."

"event","Um, just. I guess this'll show e how many of you have removed me from flists in fits of disgust or ""who was she, again?"".

<lj-cut text=""Anyway,""> Life Sucks.  My depression as been accelerating onwards & upwards since early 2013, and then Mum died relatively suddenly on November 29th.  What everyone had thought was virus-induced labyrinthitis turned out to be metastases in her brain & spinal fluid, and she deteriorated rapidly after going into hospital.

I'm currently signed off work (for 2 weeks, though the thought of returning makes me go cold as that's another Huge Area of Misery) so Im focussing on the 2 things that make getting up in the morning worthwhile; archery (though I'm in a slump due to Mum-related not shooting for 2 months, and Being Coached, which always makes things worse before they get better), and the OU maths degree (in which I remain convinced that their 1st year courses are written for idiots; I'm good at maths, but not 90%-on-a-bad-day good).

So, there's me.  Words are hard atm (which probably explains wy sums and arrows are my friends)."

"event","P.S. I forgot to mention that yesterday we went to Berkeley to get Indian Food, and when we came back one of our suite mates was sitting outside our door with MY HARRY POTTER BOOK. When we walked up she pointed at me and was like 'Oh! Oh! I borrowed this because my room mate is leaving early and had to go to sleep and I'm really sorry I was sitting out here so you didn't think I stole it and just let me know when you need it back!' I was like 'uh... okay...' because I obviously wasn't reading it, but seriously.

Coming into our room and taking a book?! That is so fucking creepy!

Then my face wash and my moisturizer was mysteriously missing, but nothing else was, which is you know, weird. At least I was running out of both so I'd have to buy more anyway, and Jaime let me use her stuff for the night. It's not big enough a deal for me to confront them, but it is a big enough deal for me to be weirded out and lock our bathroom door when we leave.

At least she [the suite mate] volunteered to clean our bathroom for us. Dear God."

"event","<B>For anyone meeting me at the airport WITHOUT CHRIS</B>

I assume that most people are going with Chris ('cause not a lot of people are going obviously, airports are nasty) but if for some reason you're not (I don't really know if anyone else is driving there) MAKE SURE YOU TEXT ME SOMETIME ON THE DAY ON SATURDAY, PREFERABLY BEFORE 2 YOUR TIME.

I'm going to be flying from SFO -> Denver -> Milwaukee, and if you plan on meeting me there you won't be able to get to the gate because security now requires a boarding pass to get up there. My phone will be off most of the day since I'm flying with only an hour and a half layover in Denver, but if you want to meet me at the airport you need to make sure I know to let you know my flight number once I figure out what it will be from Denver to Milwaukee. Then you can check those giant board things and look up my flight number and go to the gate of that concourse, which is where I'll be coming out before I get my bags and all that jazz.

If you can't get a hold of me and are dead set on coming, make sure you get a hold of Chris. YOU ARE SO NOT OBLIGATED TO GO and this isn't meant to like make you think you should go, it's just because in about 10 minutes I'm putting my computer away and will become much much much more difficult to get a hold of. If you DO need me, for whatever, you could try calling but it'll be much easier for me to reply by text because it's closing day, closing ceremonies, tearful goodbyes, etc. Also lots of cleaning.

So anyway that's that, I'll see you all in 15.5 hours!"

cosmetics that I need daily (this includes TOWELS)

chargers etc for my cellphone
laptop
nalgene bottle, silverware

sweeping
sink clean out
minor bathroom clean out (nothing too bad)
dusting drawers and what not

With these suitcases in the room on the floor and full, it just feels so definite. I feel ready to go home, and at the same time very not - it's hard to see people every day for 28 days and then just not anymore. we'll stay in touch, but going home is just going to be different. i'm starting to get more and more anxious about leaving. this whole middle ground where we're here but not here (especially tomorrow night when we're nearly entirely packed, with everything all put up and what) and we've kind of demolished our home for the past four weeks is going to feel really gross. I'm excited to see everyone, though, don't worry."

"event","Wow, tonight we have a mandatory check out meeting, tomorrow we hang art and pack... friday night is the show, then we check out, and the next day mi madre is driving me and jaime to the airport. Wow.

It feels really weird, I can't really explain it; it's like a) we just got here b) we've been here forever (we're just that close to people, and everything is so routine) and all at once c) we're never going to leave. The latter isn't really in a bad way, it just seems like it should go on being like THIS - like these classes, teachers, and peers, coming home every day at 4 to Todd and Jaime and some crazy music in our dorms. Now that leaving is becoming more of a reality I guess it's a little better to comprehend 'home' but it still feels like we should be coming back here afterwards, like when school starts up, i should be back in Oakland with all of these same people doing all of this same stuff and living in this same room. It's weird, but it's easy to think of our dorm as home, and it's easy to think of this area as 'our place' and the 'places we go.' I know the city so well, it's going to be weird going back to milwaukee.

i think i might be more nervous to go home and start integrating back into the normal flow of things than i was to come out here, which is strange. i don't know, it just feels like i missed a lot, and maybe most of it is just excitement to see everyone. if my flight is delayed i might have to smack a bitch. I don't really want to spend time on traveling, i just want to fall asleep on the plane and then wake up and we're home. Layover in Denver is going to suck, but it's only like an hour once you take out time for boarding and stuff, so I guess I'll just read me some Harry Potter and recharge the iPod.

plane comes in at 6.50pm (knock on wood) and after i go home for a little bit i'm definitely going to want to do something. keep in mind, my time 6.50 is like 4.50 so i'll be wide awake.

see you guys soon."

Okay so it was MOS DEF Plan B, Jaime and I are so good at deducing these things. To find this out required a failed trip to Safeway/Longs with her lover/boyfriend and Todd and her barging into our room and being obnoxious several more times. But to be fair, her lover/boyfriend is actually fairly hilarious and nice, and Todd is of course Todd.

Anyway so I just thought I'd share that with you guys. =)
</lj-cut>

So not to much going on in the casa... we've just been straight chillin. Last night Todd was in here until after Jaime and I passed out because he was working on his final project for Industrial Design, making a lamp and flowers and stuff. All of my projects are DONE and Jaime is in jewelery so I guess a lot of her projects have to be worked on in the actual jewelery room.

Tonight or tomorrow we're going to Berkeley to get Indian food and celebrate our survival of this course.

Two days to go, not counting today; which for me is just crits in the morning and a field trip in the afternoon. I don't know where the time went! The closer we get to leaving time the more time I have to think about everyone back home and how much I miss you guys. My flight gets back at like 6.50pm on Saturday, so we'll make it a point to hang out ASAP. (Pray for no flight delays, okay?!)"

"event","<lj-cut text=""I would look to dedicate this entry to the bitch I'm going to throwdown with in the hallway."">
So this dumb whore on our floor clearly wants to throwdown, she has demonstrated this by embodying my number one pet peeves: chicks who want to be friends with all the guys, yet ignore their female friends in the process and are complete bitches. (I suppose this pet peeve really extends to ALL of the guy's friends, I just happen to be a girl so, well, you know. Also this issue probably affects me more because a lot of my friends are guys. So there.)

Okay so this whore is all buddy buddy yay todd to todd, and yet she hates me and jaime. Me and jaime walk up and she's like 'oh.' Literally. Oh. We've tried waving at her and she just kind of purses her lips/scowls and walks on. Except the other day I kind of got her to wave, but she could've very easily just been swatting at flies because she was coughing and looked very displeased. She hates me and Jaime.

Anyway so yesterday at like 1 in the morning this chick barges into the room (todd was passed out on jaime's bed - I was laying on my bed on the computer, and jaime was at her desk) looking for todd, wakes him up out of a dead sleep while causing a huge commotion, and while her friend/boyfriend/lover (I don't know which) Grant is being cheerful and friendly and she's kind of sort of explaining why she's there she fuggin goes through my desk.

Goes. through. my desk. She like lifted up my art project and looked at the book under it which first of all, is really invasive because it's an art project, and second of all, bitch I don't want you looking at my books. Then she starts like looking through all of my sketchbooks/italian/book books on the top shelf. What the fucking hell! Finally she's like 'Oh Todd I need you to buy me something can you come out in the hall so we can talk about it?' except she makes a big deal about it (keep in mind - Todd = 19).

And then makes Todd promise not to tell us.

And then comes back in 10 minutes later with some money for Todd to buy whatever, RIGHT IN FRONT OF US all like 'thanks todd, thanks for buying IT for me! thanks! yeah i really need it! thanks!'

WHAT A BITCH, WHO DOES THAT RIGHT IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE?! The least you can do is be like 'Oh sorry I just need to talk to Todd for a second.' and do it in a more tactful way, dumb bitch.

Okay so we've narrowed it down to:
cigarettes (doubtful - Jaime thought she saw one or two 20's), salvia (doubtful - Todd doesn't even know what that is), plan b (most likely - it costs right around $40, and you have to be 18, and it explains why she AND grant came in to ask about it).

<lj-cut text=""Today in San Francisco."">
after getting my HARRY FUCKING POTTER book we traversed to 24th and Mission St, heart of the mission district, and I would like to point out how outstanding it is; as soon as we got out of the Bart station there was loud mexican music playing and there are murals just EVERYWHERE. I loved it, it was so bright and colorful and happy - we explored and went to Balmy Alley (pictures below) because one of the artists who helped organize its creation years ago came and talked to my community arts class. Then we called Jaime's sister for a restaurant suggestion and ate at this fabulous place with amazing tofu fajitas. It was sooo much food.

Then we treked through the gayborhood (the Castro District) to get to the Haight/Ashbury neighborhood, which is hippieville and thrifty stores. Pictures will come of our adventures into a photobooth.

On the way back there was this tranny dancing on the steps leading up to Buena Vista Park (which is just stairs and forest - you can't see much else, it's on a big hill) and his hips did not lie. Neither did his skirt, which flashed us a bit of ass from across the street and down a few flights. He was clearly beckoning Todd into the forest but we didn't get a picture. Bummer.

Then icecream and now home, there is a drag ball going on but I'm tired and Todd won't let us dress him like a girl. Pitty.

Also all around town were little stencils that said things like 'As the moon rose over Pontromero Hill, she said, ""Fuck off, nothing is as it seems!""' Fabulous.

i guess i get it from having you fuckers as my friends. =) they later got lost in some area and didn't know where to go and I found it for them. Silly boys.

Anyway when Jaime came back we came over to our room with Todd's computer and nice ass speakers (which are still in our room) and watched Interstella 5555, that daft punk music video for a WHOOLLLEE album. It was fabulous.

I learned how to make tofu after that. Oh, and Jaime and I got yelled at for checking our mail after hours, shut up front desk bitch. Ner, what else... nothing else. I had a dream that Todd and I taught Schmitty how to read while Jaime was at her class dinner thing.

class aside, i ate baked tofu from the cafe and fake kind of nasty but kind of addicting guacamole from safeway. i also got salsa. and then we cooked at the apartments for todd and chilled out in his room with none other than John, our swedish friend who lives in argentina, and who has this strange knack for appearing whenever we start talking about him.

must be a swede thing, i swear.

anyway jaime and i drew little diagrams of our houses and gave each other tours so that was fun. NOW IT IS TIME FOR SLEEPIES IN MY NEW MIAD SHIRT THAT MOMMY SENT ME. (anyone thinking of sending anything - this is the last week to do it so that it gets here in time for the eating)

<lj-cut text=""Today we had a Schmitty Encounter!"">
so i have this cafe card that i don't really need (oops) but i need to use it up so i'm not wasteful, and jaime and todd have some too so we're eating at the cafe for lunch for the rest of forever. anyway that's not the point, on the way back jaime and i spotted schmitty walking back from lunch with his <i>whole 2 liter bottle of fresca under one arm.</i> Oh also a friend who we will call ""Thing 2.""

we were going in to get our water bottles/wash our hands after lunch and we were just going to take the stairs, but behold, the elevator doors open - we piled in, little did we know, right after Schmitty and Thing 2. Who smelled like rancid taco dip that is slowly being secreted from the pores with a foul mix of BO and horrible expired Axe. God. anyway so schmitty is being all awkward because that's how he is all the time, and he kind of knows us just because we're always in his room so he's like 'uh. hi.' and jaime is trying to be nice so she says 'what's up schmitty?' and he gets all crazy like 'what? uh. oh. nothing.' and his friend laughed at him for his 2L or something I don't know so we get off the elevator blah blah blah do our shit

I end up leaving before Jaime but I have to go back because I forgot my god damn purse - shit fuck, so I run back to get it after she kindly unlocks the door and then I get back into the elevator with NONE OTHER THAN SCHMITTY AND THING 2. AWKWARD ASS ELEVATOR RIDE. We're just sitting there and so I decide to break the silence by asking him about the current Industrial Design project (Todd, Alex, John, Paige - they're all in ID). Schmitty's reply to how it's going: 'oh. uh. i don't know. it's okay. yeah. okay.'

and Thing 2 says: 'no dude. it's uh, it's better than okay. it's like, it's like great. yeah. you're just being uh.... what's the word... uh... you know... the word... yeah... what's the word... uh...'

This takes a few floors down in the world's slowest elevator and finally I interject, 'Modest?'

'No, not modest... uh... that word... like... when you don't give yourself enough credit... uh... HUMBLE.'

Dear God.

the whole waking up at noon thing is magical but it kind of throws the rest of the day out of focus. it was okay though; we put our pretty new dresses on and walked our happy asses into the oakland/piedmont area of town and saw HARRY FUCKING POTTER BITCHES. it was good and entertaining but they left some stuff out and that was sad making. anyway, then we came home.

todd is becoming an organ snatcher. bitch, he's todd bigelow!

okay okay okay so what next. oh laundry day. we did two loads of laundry and crammed in all of the dirty clothes jaime, todd, and i had accumulated in the past two weeks. and learned how to fall asleep standing up in the laundry room.

the clothes were so warm and delicious (we stole some of schmitty's detergent - it actually smells like sunshine daisies) that jaime and i changed into pajama type things and now we're just straight chillin while todd listens to music with the swede somewhere over in his room.

i should take more pictures for this thing but i'm too lazy, so i'll just eat fugnugs and drink my tea. oh wait i think i might have some pictures hold on.

FYI there is no ""good"" bunk - if you're up top you have to climb up but bonus you don't have to get up to answer doors and shit, that is the bottom bunk's job, but if you're on the bottom bunk, fuckers like todd always take your place. to be fair, it is closest to the little wall we designated as his spot, when he finally decides to just move a mattress in.

then we came back and it was going to be movie night except it wasn't movie night and then i went to sleep at like 1.

anyway, today we went to san fran after chilling at the apartments and eating alex's banana bread while we watched maximus juggle. amazing. we had a nice little walk - got off at the embarcadero, wandered around, went to chinatown, went to citylights (bought ANOTHER book), went to japantown which was kind of a hike, bought nori and hello kitty starbursts, had a japanese mall adventure...

okay so anyway, alex was trying to stay but he had to leave to go back to the apartments and then these two other girls came (one from california, one from oregon) so we were talking for awhile, but halfway through, jaime and i got really tired. so we decided to sleep on todd's bed. anyway we woke up about when the girls left and when todd took pictures of us sleeping at strange strange angles and then we made him come sit on the very comfortable bed and we decided to has a slumber partyz.

except about that time schmitty walked in and gave us the most strange look and just turned around and walked out. he was like 'don't worry i'm going' and we were like 'you don't have to go!' and then i guess when we left to move the slumber party to our room (and my bed, because bottom beds work better for these things) he told todd not to have sex in his bed and then shuffled off to the lounge to watch anime. so anyway we came over here and ate a great many things, such as green tea, spinach, strawberry cheesecake ice cream, golden sundae icecream, and also tortillas. Actually jaime ate the tortillas. With icecream in them.

THEN WE HAS A SLUMBER PARTYZ LOL. It was really just all of us sleeping on my bed in little balls except Jaime was smart and switched to her bed at about 4 or so. Fucking genius.

And sleep, of course, since we are all so short on that - but our plan to go to bed really early was FOILED!

Jaime and I stayed in and all the guys went out to cheap mexican food and we decided that we're going to have 'No dinner dinners' where we pack like little tupperwares of food and go out to eat with them so we don't have to spend money. then we can be shystie and eat under the table. Anyway so Todd came by when they all got back because he lives on our floor and he didn't feel like going out with the rest of them and he ended up chilling with us until like 2 - we just kind of sat around and talked, and then at one point we to our floor's 'VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY PARTY.'

This is where it starts getting fun because aside from eating cake and icecream we MOS DEF stole about 8 cupcakes and 2 sandwiches to put in our freezer for later use - HILARIOUS. Jaime and I took some and then went to Todd's dorm and got some of his clothes and put our hair up and wore those to steal some more. Then we were like laughing at how sneaky we were and taking pictures of our stolen food and making facebook groups when we got a little bored (oh we also played with my tablet and so Jaime has decided to draw me a picture every day. See Facebook.) when we got the genius idea to grab my camera and go lay by the window that faces out at the apartments (it's floor to ceiling) and cryptically call Alex.

Jaime mos def called him and just growled and made these weird clicking noises and he was like having a heart attack. ""Are you crackheads? Are you crackheads who stole Todd's phone? What the fuck, man?"" Hilarity ensued.

I'm sure the dorm at least would be a lot more cozy if we actually lived here and could get some rugs or what, but it's fine as is... and the road we're off of is so cute, all little cafes and thrift stores and what. And it was really chill to run around town today - so much freedom! I'm lovin it."

"event","jaime and i always straight chill in our room with the door open, so right when we got back from a safeway outting and were snacking on dinner this kid she knew came by and asked if we wanted to go to chinatown.

duh.

so me and her and katie and jen and alex and max and matt and jasper and cassidy and todd all went down to chinatown where we thought alex was just getting us ridiculously lost, but we found a place to have dinner and they ordered, of all things, snails. Everyone but me and Katie (the vegs) tried them... you had to like scoop them out with a toothpick and bite it off just before the egg sack so you didn't eat baby snails... then suck out the juices... I took a lot of pictures on my phone so I'll see if maybe I can get those up in the next few days. We had a lazy susan just piled with food and we ate almost all of it, then we went back to katie and jen's dorm (a floor down) with todd from our floor and ate icecream. I feel sick.

Oh also, all of us minus cassidy and jasper and matt snuck into a hotel so we could go up to the top floor and look at the San Francisco night."

Classes are super nice, I have drawing in the morning and in the afternoon Community Arts, which is actually going to be a pretty tight class on arts and art activism. We develop a lot of community stuff and complex ideas, so I'm pretty pumped for that.

Other than that, classes are really fucking exhausting... we got up this morning and had a little mini greeting by the staff and then they took us to our classes. It was mostly just talk for me (Jaime is in jewelery and metal foundry, so she started working) but towards the end we got to start on this collaborative thing that we're continuing tomorrow.

Now I'm going to go with these two girls from downstairs and Jaime and Auddi next door to SAFEWAY BRB"

"event","the best thing about california is that the temperature is perfect - even though our room was stuffy and a little warm last night, with two fans and then window open it got cool so fast I woke up like 5 minutes before my alarm because I was chilly.

very nice.

anyway, we set our alarms too early so now we're just sitting and chilling until 8.15 when we get to go do MORE ORIENTATION. YEAH YEAH.

and then obviously classes which I guess will be good, I don't know. I really don't entirely understand what community arts is, even though i signed up for it, so let's hope i get lucky. nothing else doing, but these odwalla bars are delicious and I encourage you all to eat some because they are going to get me through the month.

I'll be home in 26 days. =)"

School is good, I really like the campus and the area is cute. We haven't really done much tonight except play some weird name game and eat some pizza, but big thanks for Chris and Mom for helping me move into the room and get groceries (the 3 trips to Long's and Safeway were well worth it).

"event","yeah shut up i'm still too lazy for pictures.

we woke up late today and went on a city tour that was like 5 hours long, it hit all the major things that we missed and the major thing that we had seen already (chinatown) was last so we just kind of left when they got there. we saw the tea gardens, nob hill, the opening scene from full house (LOL), uh... lord knows what else. Oh, Sausolito (SALSAlito) was nice too. It's a slightly warmer beach town than San Francisco, full of little art galleries and cafes and whatever.

other than that north beach is prolly my most fav. we got off there at the tour and went to City Lights (a beat bookstore founded by one of the beat founders!) and I bought two books, Our Space and Howl. I love that bookstore, mostly because they had Banksy and Obey Giant books in the window. The alley between that and Vesuvio (the beat coffee shop of choice) was all murals and gorgeous.

then we went into chinatown and i got presents for people, and then we ate at a little resturant in north beach and came back to the hotel.

now i'm eating pumpkin pie fudge and chillin. gonna dye my hair soon and then go to bed, tomorrow i move into my dorm yeah yeah."

yesterday we drove down to santa cruz and toured the campus for chris - nice ass campus. if i didn't despise math and science and... well, all those other classes that I don't really have to take, i would probably go there. driving was fun, the top was down the whole way. the only downside to this was that I got a little pink, but i put some aloe on it and it's already going tan.

after santa cruz we headed to CalState Monterey Bay (at Seaside) which is a GHOST TOWN. We didn't even get out to look at that campus, it was scary shit. All we saw were two people (probably ghosts), a bunch of abandoned military baracks, a vulture, and an ass ton of grows all sitting in one tree and staring at us.

needless to say, we quickly put the top up and left, back to santa cruz for dinner.

today is some city wide tour of san fran... then more chinatown. tomorrow is moving into my dorm!

also: chris is in the bathroom and I can't get in to get my makeup brushes. shit."

We went down to Fisherman's Wharf again today, we had some night time tour of Chinatown. While waiting we took an hour tour of the bay so we saw the city and also Alcatrez.

Favorite thing? People who beg for money in amazing and humorous ways. Example: Sign that says 'WHY LIE? I NEED A BEER' with a sign near his feet saying 'NOW ACCEPTING VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER....' or the guy who asked for 'money or a joint' when we walked by. Walking back there was mos def the smell of pot, which was totally hilarious. At least he got what he wanted.

We shopped a little bit and mostly bummed around touristy area, learned about the city, whatev whatev.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v228/morecalymne/CALIFORNIA081.jpg"">

There was a pretty nice break team... breaking, obviously. So that was exciting. One of the guys came up and the leader or whatev was introducing him as 'Whateverhisname was... really likes the white girls!' and my mom and chris started cheering and pointing at me. Awesome.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v228/morecalymne/CALIFORNIA213.jpg"">

After Chinatown (walking through) the last tour of the day stopped on Treasure Island (no, it's real) and we got to take night pictures.

Then today we got here around two... pm, of course, and we got our car and luggage and stuff. The highlight? This door thing on a shuttle to the car rentals, if you stood in it too long some automated voice yelled at you. 'YOU ARE DELAYING THE PROGRESS OF THE PASSENGERS OF THIS TRAIN. PLEASE STEP ASIDE.'

The hotel. It's pretty nice, we're in a handicapped room, so we have.. well, a lot of room, and a big bathroom with no bathtub but a shower. So there's a positive for you.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v228/morecalymne/CALIFORNIA002.jpg"">
This is all of the luggage. Mine is the green duffel, the magenta suitcase, the camo carryon, and I also HAD a floral suitcase (same size) but the airport lost it. Luckily it was only dishes and sheets, and if they don't find it there is a giant blue Ikea right across the street so I can get cheap stuff of lesser quality for about the same price as the crap I bought at goodwill. Minus hello kitty sheets, but what can you do. Fuck an airline.
</lj-cut>

So after our little adventure at the airport and driving in rush hour traffic, we got to our hotel and checked in and got jamba juice and drove down to Fisherman's Wharf - via longest way possible, as we parked in the middle of Chinatown and hiked. It was okay though: I went to Chinatown Walgreens, and now all other Walgreens pale in comparison."

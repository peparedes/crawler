""you are the only person who calls me, you're my only friend, blah, blah blah.."" what about me? you wonder why you have no friends! because you treat people like an afterthought in your pursuit of being ""hot"" or whatever you're trying to do...seriously shitty, seriously...you are not coming of as cute, you are coming off as trashy and slutty and not the least bit charming...i am sick of hearing it from you, it's boring, and there used to be other things to your personality than your realationships with guys...it's sooo boring and honestly, gross, the way you demean yourself...


and i can no longer stand the way you do not listen to anyone when you talk, maybe because i've known you so long it bothers me more or i notice it more, whatever, but i do notice, the way after i finish talking you say stuff like ""anyway,i"" or ""yeah, i mean, it's like"" and continue talking about yourself...like you have something more important to say, like you know more about whatever it is we're talkingabout than i do, you are ALWAYS trying to one up me, ALWAYS! even when my dad died, first of all, i called you the night it happened and the day after and the day after that to talk to my ""best friend"" and instead of calling me back you went out with colleen, and i know you knew i called because i spoke with both carla and carlos, but whatever, that's not the worst of it, but that was pretty shitty, the worst thing is every time i try to talk to you about my grief over LOSING MY DAD you turn it around and make it about you! ""yeah, i blah blah blah"" and ""when linda died blah blah blah"" even you can know that linda dying is no way the same as my dad, so spare me, please...can you even see you do this? can you stop? you do it to everybody and that is one of the reasons why people don't like you, but the fact that you do it to you ""best friend"" after her FATHER DIES is seriuosly wrong and disturbing

and please! i know you said this isn't the case,but 15 years with the same pattern really does make it the case..because i do something or have a certain characteristic you do not need it also, i get sick, you get sick, i smoke menthols, you smoke menthols, these are just 2 examples, you know in your heart of hearts you have been doing this as long as i've know you...is it a strange coincidence that ONCE AGAIN not even a week after i get prescribed meds from the shrink you have a ""nervous breakdown"" you don't even know what that is, you have no idea, you had a hissy fit because i was mad at you, and it is belittling to me and my illness that you fake it every time you more attention from mommy, when are you going to grow up?

sometimes i wonder why i'm still friends with you, it can be so stressful and i don't need any added stress...but i think if maybe we can try to settle things and you try to LISTEN to what i am trying to say, it's not worth throwing away a 14 year friendship...i hope so anyway"

so, the new shrink isn't so bad even though heesa notso strong weetha engleesh, ah? i think he's from mother russia, nice guy, apparently competent doctor, so ok in my book....but while in the waiting room i noticed every single patient i saw was a woman, not a single man! what's up with that? i think women have a harder time dealing with shit than men because we actually think and aren't heartless pricks, but i could biased because i hate men.
AND! they had the most fucked up painting in the waiting room, it was a picture of sandals with greek letters and a bunch of other weird-ass shit going on, i think i went schitzo just looking at it, why would they put that in with the nuts? every where else in the hospital there's pictures of flowers and sailboats and crap but in the PSYCH office they put this random fucking thing that looks like georgia o'keefe puked up a sam & libby catalog, WHY,GOD, WHY? 

oh, and of course doc told me to lay of the drinking for a while, which is what all my doctors tell me (i feel like an after-school special) but this time i'm listening, i decided to lay off the sauce myself already, it makes me feel crappy, it costs allot of $$ and it makes me fat, i don't walk 3 miles a day just to put millions of empty calories back into my thighs, at about $50 a night, fuck that.

so, yeah, hopefully these meds will help, let's hope, if not, oh well, whatever, nevermind..."

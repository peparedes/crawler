Those of which we never told, lied through the melting tears for nothing but the darkest days she used to live through, I used to live through. What covers our cold long waited whispers under the chill of that bright storm. The ones we used to look out to in the glass windows filled with crying rain. The door shut behind us, leaving me alone with those cold words said to. When you think you didn't hurt me at all.. is when you know you did more than ever. The unfair judgements you pointed at as I stood there listening. Thinking if there would ever be a day I'd hear you say ""Im proud of you."" Leaving the footsteps from wet shoes and those bright sunny days in puddles of mud. The irony of the lies we told and the things we said, maybe it was better off brown than yellow. The sun that used to be so jolly, was frowning right back at her, behind the clouds weeping for those days she used to smile. 

How can a cold, chilly whisper force it's way out into the open. Filling up the category of Pathetic, unlikely to unfold beneath each words. The drops of rain breaking the silence during the days that she used to talk of truth. Staring at the bird, one that forces his way through the glass window, giggling to herself on how pathetic it looked.. and how desperate it seemed. 

The cuts of judgement and hurt tears crying, made its way down her cheek. One drop smudged one sentence. And a lot more damage done. The self esteem so fragile, was just let down with a heavy bang. So much for great parenting skills father, you just let your daughter see how pathetic she is."

Maybe she was stubborn enough to try to fall once again through the stormy nights of alone time. [pardon me for the shallow words and senseless things tyoed. you always are succesful with these shallow entries after all] what's new?

maybe when you think about it she was stubborn. [period.] don't let her fall for you. Past was always past. She's scared of the present now. Past always finds it's way back. And this is one of those days when she feels like it is. Don't let it come true. The meaningless kiss you sent her made her smile. Coz for her it was meaningful and yet for you it meant you were gonna leave. Or disappear. How come everything stopped when you made her happy? When she told you, you made her happy? How come you had the heart to do that if you knew? How come you had the guts to do that?

Why can't people just stop putting up signs that reads 'Not Allowed' whenever I try to passby? Why can't I just be blind for a while and act like I didn't see it just coz I really didn't?

I'm not even sure if this is revenge, all I know is that it's somehow supposed to make her feel bad. But little girls aren't supposed to cry as much at an early age. It's psychologically wrong and sad. So let it be with that boy. My favorite boy if so. But as I pass by every warning, let me just say. It's unfair. How every guy's supposed to be dictated.

"event","Chocolate swirls along with strawberry milk shakes. Caramel candies with the soda pop bottles. Cherry stems with ribbons, tied with golden bows. The little pretty eyes blinked through the wind's blow. The soft pink blushes and paperdoll dresses. Polk a dots and rainbows, hullah hoops and hop skotch. Wine in barrels, vineyards so huge. The skips in the garden and wine tasted like so. Sips and clear glasses, crystals so nice. The memories lived in a vineyard glows. The vows of an angel for a wish left in sea. One poor little widow carried her dreams. As she sat in the porch with one dog beside. The only companion her husband left behind. The stares from afar and the smiles of memories, wishing that a remembrance would come down for a visit. The dog of which she loved, ever so dearly. Just one more special heart she longed for as she grew older. Each tear in her eyes were kept for so long. The worries of a goodbye and longed for hello. The broken hearted widow sat, as she waited, for that one vow from an angel once when she was kid. But a vow was a vow and so she waited. For that night that she'd hear the voice of her dearly beloved. 

It starts out when they were kids and the forgotten promises hurt as each day gone by. And yet it didn't hurt because it was never broken. The matter of time, eating up memories from him. She longed for the day she heard from him. She was a young lady when he once said that the one girl he'll always love is this girl sent from above. As the days pased by, they both held hands tight. Right ontop of the tree, on the branches, held up high. I love you."

"event","Did you ever get that feeling when you just feel like being alone? Or that you just wish that someone out there's looking after you whenever you feel like you no one cares? Or when you hide under the blanket just coz you're afraid of the dark, not knowing that it's still dark under? But you've always known that the darkness under the blanket was somewhat comforting compared to the outside. What about the feeling when you start to like someone and feel comfortable and nice around him then people start telling you that you shouldn't or that someone hates you and you just can't live with that. The feeling when you know you want to like him and you know you do and something tells you it's ok to. But then something else shouts out its not. When that kind of a feeling comes, what do you do? Its like when you start to know someone and then you just know him and you guys got like super close and then he turns into a stranger. Then you hate yourself for that kind of change. Then all of a sudden you tell yourself ""but i love that stranger"". And everytime you whisper ""i miss you""s you feel like you're lying. Then when you finally move on and fall for someone else, you feel like it's this huge risk. But don't you think risks where meant to be there in the first place? If you know there's danger ahead, risks are meant to be taken. But you tell yourself ""this one might not be a stranger, so it's perfectly fine"" [but it's not]."

Love is when you make each other feel safe.
Love is when you try to make sense but you know you'd never get to.

Love is when you run around barefoot as rain pours down.

Love is when he pulls you away for a dance under the moonlight. [even though there's no music]
Love is when you don't care about how you look infront of him.
Love is when you don't care if he looks terrible.
Love is truth.

Maybe that's why I'm exaggerating right now. I finally moved on. The days I spent sulking because of you are long gone. The time I wasted as I longed for the past will be replaced with days lived in the present. I'll wait for the thorns to cut my wrist once again. If that happens, I guess it won't really matter coz I believe the first cut will always be the deepest scar ever. When I took my final step into moving on, I wondered if I was doing the exact same thing as the last one. But then I realized, it'll never be the same since my ""I miss you""s are lies now. One lie that would always be scribbled down. So I guess when I said that I feared the time a goodbye would have to be said, I wasn't really thinking of the hello I would say to another person right after the goodbye I leave you with."

And when she starts starving herself, maybe she just wants to feel comfortable about herself. And when she does, don't you think you should be happy for her? Coz it means that she's doing something to make herself feel better? But when she starts to stare at the floor or at nothing that's when you know there's something wrong.

Because she's one of those people that wishes she could tell them to close their eyes when she passes by just coz she doesn't wanna be seen and she doesn't wanna see them. She's that sort of girl that wishes she was never here because she doesn't know where to go when she's taken away. She's someone who doesn't feel safe."

"event","Maybe if we just give out the blank looks we started with last year then last year might come back. Maybe if we just wish for the past every 11:11 pm then we might just not look pathetic. Maybe if we just wish harder each time a star twinkles our way then maybe we'd finally get what we wished for. Maybe if we wince each tear away, it won't bother us anymore. And if we sleep earlier every night, the dream we ask for might come back. And if we play safe every day we wake up then maybe every lie will seem true. If every 'ifs' come back as we tell ourselves through every step we take each day, then maybe there's hope. But then I said if before I said that. It's funny how every sentence you try to make sense but then every attempt makes you feel more pathetic than expected. When your eyes feel tired but we don't mind it'll cause some serious side effects, like a heart break. Or a minor heart attack. This girl needs help. She doesn't want a hand, she doesn't want a shoulder to cry on, she's waiting for words to get back to. She needs the eyes to look at and the courage to speak up. She doesn't want the food, she doesn't wanna chew. She needs to starve and feel all empty. Let her for the past few weeks, it's a diet she needs to take. But when it comes to feelings, something must go wrong each time she speaks. The words were taken away, hiding and running scared. The winks and twinkles in each eye makes more sense than one word left out. The predictions and day dreams of what could've beens would make each day worse for the need of the past makes it harder to live the present. When you want to leave the future alone just coz of the past and the present, that's when everyone doesn't matter. But when someone tells you that you have someone to talk to and he volunteers himself, that's an act of bravery, given the fact that this girl's going through a lot. The wanting of the faint scene one night and the passing out in the dark was wished for. Maybe when you whisper to yourself that you wanna be hit by a car when you're the one beside a door. Or when you wanna step on the gas when turning the blind corner. Or when you wonder if a stranger's staring at you from outside a clear glass, with a gun in hand and the trigger waiting to be pulled. Then you wish that he's aiming for your heart. Because ""giving up was never in my vocabulary until I realize that loving you was so hard"". Grammar teacher asked for one quote and I said a lot. But then I realize that aside from every word written down and every word waiting to be meant, I should've just written down the three words I've been thinking of...

"event","I get it. There are times I wish that I could rewind and not have the past I had. There are times when I think present's not worth living because of the past. When you believe that if you could change the past, and make most of the present, the future would be great. But then we all kow the past can't happen again. It makes you wonder what happens now? then when you finally feel like you don't or shouldn't miss him, you begin to want him. But then regretting isn't really about the thing you did it's also about the thing you didn't do and having the words you left unsaid. When you had the chance to tell him all you did was drop a tear. That's when you feel like you made the past worse and not worth living. Even though your memories with him were memories you'd love to have again, you'd think that with the words you said and meant weren't worth it to have again. [in case you'd go through it again] Then you begin to wonder if you do love him and you answer yourself no. You ask yourself what is love anyway?

       Love is having that someone in your mind most of the time. And if you're not thinkign of him, he's in the back of your head. Just like a dream. Thenn you begin to wonder if it's the same with reality.
      Love is when you continue wantin the memories back, even him back. Even though deep inside you're hurting.
      Love is when you still care even if you tell yourself you don't miss him anymore.
And if you'd think that you do love him because you identify with everything mentioned above. Think about it, then when you really think so then that'll only mean that he'll always be that guy for you. Even rhough you wish that you're 30 years old now, married and fulfilled, did you ever think about who you'd want to be married to? This is what I'm talking about. Though we try to escape what's become of the past, we can't really escape it if we're living the present."

"event","The feeling of not having to dream again giving the eyes bags to pull down. There's no point on sleeping if you don't have dreams to comfort you. There's no point on moving on if you don't have anywhere to go to or even someone to run to. Though you talk to someone all the time for some reason to take it all out. If you pour out everything everytime then why do you have something to give out whenever you're alone. The ink blots aren't visible anymore. Not a soul could recognize the words anymore and the coffee stains defeated its purpose. Maybe every between the line reading right now would help the others see if this girl talking is alright. Maybe it'll give them a clue on what's going on in her head. If the ink blots can't explain it, what can? If the coffee stains can't stand up for her, what can? How much tears will it take for her to stand up and talk? But to tell you the truth this girl cried every tear she had left thinking that somehow maybe he'll hear. But then if only someone told her [to think again]. If you tell her to let go, will she? She thinks she's crazy. She thinks she's insane. She thinks she lost everything she had, including writing. This isn't considered as a work of heart. It's far from what the rest of the words she left unspoken. That's part of regret. Thinking that you should've said something when he was looking at you. Thinking that you should've told him every unspoken word inside the heart that he held on to for quite sometime. [at least she thought so] but then the hidden desires to hold your hand and take that midnight walk with you til dawn would suffer the pain of not having it. What would you do if you think that everything you have right now was with someone else, someone you're trying to forget and then you begin to tell yourself that he's here to stay and you can hold on. But then when you hold on to something, thinking that you're holding on to dear life, you look down and realize you're only 12 inches above the ground. and yet you don't feel safe to let go just coz you don't want to. What does it mean when you tell yourself you love him but you don't miss him. What does it mean when you tell yourself that every single day?

To regret isn't just about what you did. It's also about what you didn't do and having to have the words you wish you said inside you as you look at the person you apparently don't miss."

Yes.

High school is not as bad as I expected it to be; I'm actually having fun. This first grading period has gone by so fast; I hopeit's like this the whole year... I miss summer! XD

Yeah, so. I'm still alive. I will probably switch to <href=""http://www.xanga.com/s7venstarbox"">Xanga</a> again, because for some reason, I find that easier to post in for short little updates on my life, but don't count on it.

I was making plans with Reba, to go to the movies, and my mom wouldn't take us... so then, she's like ""I can take you, just get her mom to pick you up"" and I said no, because she didn't want to take us. Mother got mad. Made me cry. Made me do dishes. Wouldn't let me call Reba back. Wah. I won't say what was running through my mind; it's untypable.

Ha.

So I put in the Sims and played from 2:30 to ...7:30.

Yeah... My Physics teacher is a pervert. o_o;; He told us on the first day that if the girls wore a low cut shirt, he'd look (""on accident""), but he'd keep looking, because it wasn't as if there's a sign saying only cute young guys can look. God. Nasty ass freak. ~_~"

"event","It's only moments when I'm depressed and searching for sympathy that I realize how foolish I am, trying to act so mature. 

I'm 14 years old. I'm a freshman. I'm self-centered. I need to socialize constantly. I can't be alone for more than a few hours. 

I have to admit these things to myself everyday now, but I still refuse to actually believe it. My friends, mainly on the internet, that are years older than me... or at least older than 15... I think they can vouch for all of the aforementioned.

I'm needy; I'm selfish. I'm aware that things I do sometimes hurt other people, but I'm still stuck on the fact that everyone deserves to be happy. I have this state of mind that I've played the good girl long enough; I deserve to take what I want now... until I've played that long enough, then I go back to being the good girl.

I can't do that anymore, I've realized.

I ask for too much, and I give nothing in return. Or, if I do, it's materials - I know that this is a material world, but everyone knows that money can't buy love, and it's the thought that counts, and ...everything else.

I don't think about the futures; I don't forsee consequences of what I do. I don't look at the big picture. Doing that makes life so unbearable to me... Everything people have seen in such a bad side of me, and I guess later in life I'll ""break from my shell""... but right now, I'm just so tired of myself. I don't want to stay up, and think about the things I could've done right previously, or how wonderful and happy I'd be if I'd done this, or avoided that, and so on.

I can't act like something I've never known. I haven't experienced half of what my life has to offer, but I act as though I've been around for a long time. I've been alive 14 years - that's nothing, compared to the 80 or 90 I hope to live. Thinking that makes me ashamed, that I've tried to be someone greater than I am, for so long.

I don't want to think like this anymore. I'm crying my eyes out, and thought this through... but there's no conclusion. ...I feel like I've missed something. Or maybe it's missed me. I don't know... I feel like I just need someone to hold my hand for a few more years, and then I'll be fine. But I can't rely on people anymore; I have to be mature about this...

I'm contradicting myself... 

I don't want to go to high school. I want to have just a few more days of thinking this over, and crying. I just want to cry and cry. I want to feel like my lungs have been through the shredder. 

There's so many things I want, but so many things I won't get.

This makes me feel foolish to, posting it where everyone can see, and where the person that started this 'revelation' can read if s/he so desired. And it hurts also, knowing that s/he probably won't read this, until I've gotten over it. This started over the stupidest reason too, and of course it's all my fault.

I still want people to feel sympathy for me, even though I know it's wrong. I want people to say it's okay, and that it wasn't my fault- I want comfort. But I don't deserve it. Look at what a child I am. I think about how, at Orientation, they said we were officially high schoolers now, and I want to scream and throw a tantrum. I'm not ready. Everyone says these are the best four years of your life, but I'm sobbing and my chest hurts and I can't help but think of how foolish I am.

I know how distant I am from all my friends that are older than me now, and it makes me feel alone. Yeah, I'm a kid. Feel free to patronize me now. I don't care, because I've finally realized it myself. 

This doesn't make sense to any of you, I know.
But I'm depressed over the simplest things... and of course the largest.
I don't want to go to high school. I don't want school to start... Because then I'll start fighting with my parents again, and I'll get low grades and my mother will get mad when I lie about homework, and she'll lose whatever ounce of trust she has left in me... and I'll start hating her... and I'll feel horrible, because my dad takes my side, and my mom gets mad at him... I don't want to wake up tomorrow; my last day of summer vacation.

I'm going to go cry some more; leave you guys alone."

<i>The future doesn't scare me nearly as much as it's supposed to</i>. Everyone I've shared these with has laughed (the current count is 5). >_> WHAT DO YOU THINK?!

"event","Today was Freshman Orientation. I had to wake up at 8 AM, which would be okay as I'll be waking up at 6:30 AM in less than a week anyway, but what really pissed me off was that my friend Lauren, who I was taking to Orientation, was about 15 minutes late. You had to be there at 9:30, or you're out of luck -- and we got there at about... 9:25. My dad was so mad, but luckily didn't show it when her mother dropped her off at our house.

So, we went to Orientation. They did some skits, which were adorably stupid - adorably, because that's the good thing about highschool: cute boys. Mm. x)

The freshman cheerleaders did a routine, which sucked... one of the two girls that they held up on their hands fell, and I was like ""That's a bad omen for things to come"" and Lauren goes ""Yeah... ONE WILL FALL."" It was funny. Kinda creepy too, because I'm unlucky that way. Scares me, really. If it 'comes true', I wonder what it will mean? Death? Emotional destruction? x_x Freaky!

But the freshman dance squad's routine was pretty good: shiny blue pants = love. XD The senior cheerleaders did a routine, and there was a new male on the squad. He was hot! <3 <3 <3 I felt embarassed for him though, because everyone was laughing and making jokes and pointing at him. x_x'' 

According to my brother - who knows a few cheerleaders on the squad through band and such nonsense (choir is better, bitches! XD) - he's a freshman, but ""only the seniors could handle a 'potentionally homosexual male' on their team,"" Samuel eloquently states. I hope to get to know him, even though - because he's cute - all the girls will be fawning over him; and if I do, inspiration for shounen ai stories for me, and a non-homophobic friend for him! Everyone wins! No, really - I want to see what he's like and things; he's cute! <3

Oh, speaking of CUTE...

An old friend, Justin, from way back in elementary, has been gone practically all summer. He said he'd be back for Orientation, but I didn't remember until he came up behind me in the auditorium at the high school and yelled ""RACHEL!"" I turned around just before he grabbed me and lifted me up in this really tight hug. I hardly had enough muscle strength left to hug him back - there were a number of reasons for this temporary paralysis of mine:

1) I was surprised.
2) OMFGZ JUSTIN IS BACK!
3) I don't get hugged by guys often, especially in such a way where I am lifted off my seat and in a public place.
4) It felt like I was pressed against a concrete wall. He's got ABS. OMFG! -Faints-

He let me go - and I fell on top of my chair (with the cushion in it's upright position, so the hard metal part dug right into my lower back-- OW!) because I was so surprised my legs couldn't seem to hold me up. I finally got a good look at him, and... Jeez. It's amazing what a little weight loss and hair-product can do to someone. <3 He's hot now. ^____^;;; I mean, he wasn't ugly before - he was cute - but now he's... drool worthy. REALLY drool worthy.

So he hugged all my other friends (is that a pang of jealousy I feel?!), and then went back to his seat. After the Orientation Skits and Display of Finesse or whatever the hell you wanna call it, we stayed for the tour around the school and met up with Justin and his friend Emily (Emilie?).

There was this one funny part in the skits though... They had this list, ""The Top 10 Things We Love About [Little]"" (Little is my high school's name... in a foreign language. Haha.)

<STRIKE>Most weren't stupid enough to make fun of</STRIKE> I forget what most of them are, but there was one ""Reason We Love [Little]"" and that was ""every other car is over $30,000"" (it's in one of those... rather well-off neighborhoods).

So they had this skit displaying how there are rich, preppies driving those cares, showing these two boys dressed as the stereotypical snotty rich person, and Lauren - next to me - says really loud (in the quiet spot when the laughter of their outfits died down, and before they started speaking): ""And all the gays in the world rejoiced! Hey baby- Meet me up in the GSA (Gay Straight Alliance)!""

That was hilarious. No one really understood what she said, but all our friends and I cracked up laughing. Kind of a situation where you had to be there, but HOLY SHIT.. it took about 5 minutes for all of us to calm down.

Okay, so... o_o;; Hmm... 

We met up for the tours, and we all fawned over Justin and Cat (who was in New England all summer). Mostly Justin, which really pissed Cat off, because she's an attentionwhore, but ohwellwhocares. He kept saying to me on the 'net that he was fat and gained so much weight, but he lost weight and gained a lot of muscle mass! Lauren (who had a public crush/obsession on him last year) and I kept joking with him to strip for us, and every time he'd teasingly lift his shirt and we'd scream-- then he'd pull it down. T_T TORTURE! 

We learned nothing in the tours. They were led by the seniors, who I think really don't give a shit about whether we find our way around the school this century or not. So we were in the back of our rather large group (no bigger than 25 people?! Yeah right. >_> This was about... 40 kids), so we couldn't hear what our ""tour guide"" was saying. We didn't even know the guide's gender - it was only until we decided to switch to group ""B"" because hot guys that seemed to have the potentional to know about Dir en grey were in group ""B"".

We couldn't hear anything that tour was saying, but we didn't care-- having too much fun showing off our hot guy friend to all the bitchy girls from the other school that flows into [Little]. Unfortunately, the bitchiest girls are from my school... Sigh. 

We lost our group when we went past about 3 other groups going in the opposite direction, so we just kept switching until we reached our original group - group ""A"" - and pushed our way to the front. I know where the Pavilion and Home Economics are. Yey. That's going to help me find the Chemistry room on the 3rd floor, right? >_> Pfft.

Yeah... Over all, I think this was a very bad day, because it was sweltering hot, and most of the classrooms at my high school are temporary buildings (despite it being in a rich neighborhood -- huh!), thus no air conditioning more than half the time we were touring -- and I don't know where anything is, I didn't get my locks even though I should have, and the school is much more confusing than it is from afar.

But I enjoyed seeing all of the old crew together again, like it was at lunch and before school like last year. It makes me sad now, becuase I know that I won't keep in touch with half of them - it's impossible. Our electives are different, or we have different levels of the class- Regulars, Honors, GT, etc; for most of them, the reason I even knew them is because we both knew one or two people, and we all sat together at lunch... Who knows if we'll have the same lunch this year? If we do, we'll keep in touch I guess, but if we don't... Ahh... I'm just so worried about what's going to happen to my close group of friends - my best friend's already going to a different high school; I don't want to lose the ones I have.


So, after Orientation, Lauren and I hung around my hosue for about 45 minutes -- she was reading my Paradise Kiss mangas, and I was playing Super Mario Bros. on the Super Nintendo. Then her mom picked us up, and drove us to the mall, and we hung around Walden's Books for about 30+ minutes because of me. I was having trouble deciding which 4 mangas to buy, and which to get free. In the end I got Petshop of Horrors #5, Sweet & Sensitive #1, Fantasy Land #1 (not as ghey as it sounds... though close to it), Doll #1, and Snowdrop #4.... We walked around for a little while... They drove me home. 

I thought Fantasy Land was shounen ai, because the girl looks like a BOY. But NO. SHE HAS TO HAVE A VAGINA, DOESN'T SHE?! That pissed me off.

Yeah... Anyway... I changed my icons, because it kind of annoyed me to see them move all the time... and I was bored with the ones I had (George & Isabella from ParaKiss, Kaoru x Toshiya/Fireworks, and Kaoru: ""Aimlessly"")... I might decide to keep Aimlessly, but I'll probably make a new one with some pretty original art pictures I found, or of this cosplayer doll thing I heard about in a ParaKiss community... La la. Or maybe of someone else. I don't know. But something that doesn't move that much, because that irritates me. >_>;; Yeah... So how do like the one I have now (there's another, but I guess I'll let you find that one on your own)? Goffic art makes me hot.

Yeah... I bet your opinions of me have changed now that you know I'm a freshman ""fish"". OHWELLWHOCARES . . . . . . . . (me).

Whoo, go French pop! I need more- anyone know any free mp3 rotation sites or anything similar where I can get some more?? XD

...yeah. I'm going to make a new layout for my LJ soon, now that I've seen <lj user=""_xxshort_supply"">'s new layout. Weeeeee. I'll make it goffic-y, with some pictures from the ""High Score"" manga, or ""Alichino"". I CANNOT WAIT FOR TOKYOPOP TO RELEASE ALICHINO! -Calms down.- Sorry. O_o"

Oh my GOD.

I love this song. I completely forgot about it, as I downloaded it about a year or so ago, on my other (less used) computer - and it won't play, because the music program I use died. So, I forgot about it, and while surfing some mp3 rotation sites, I came across it, and completely remembered why this introduced me to Gackt, and why I love(d) him so much.

I cannot express the way this song makes me feel. It makes me nostalgic, and rather sad, but it's such a beautiful song and-- I can't explain it! Most Gackt fans would know what I'm talking about, I think...

It makes me want to cry, for some odd reason, even though my heart seems to have swelled considerably from the happiness of finding this song again. <3

(This makes no sense at all. Makes you wonder what my complex feelings must be like.)

Okay, got off the phone with DC chan, and now I'm happy again. And feeling uber-cute. *shot*

I was playing Super Nintendo/NES earlier today. I was playing... Aladdin. Despite the fact it was made in 1992, I still suck at it. >< That's bad. XDD



I feel so very depressed right now; nostalgic, too, I suppose, though nostalgic is anyone's guess -- I think nostalgic isn't a good way to describe it; I just seem to realize why my mother sometimes bursts into tears when she looks at my baby pitures. 

It makes me sad, because even though ""growing up"" is difficult for me, I never really consider how difficult it is for my parents to accept that I'm not a little girl anymore. I know my parents aren't perfect, and I know they are scared for me, given the mistakes I've made previously, and not just because I might make some bad choices, but because they've gone through all this before and know how overwhelming it can be getting older... 

But I think they're also scared for themselves, because even though they know what I'm feeling, they don't know what they're going to feel - when my brother and I graduate from high school and college, get married and have families of our own. They only have anticipation, and a sense of dread, that, sooner, rather than later, they're going to have to just stand at the sidelines, and watch us make our decisions - whether they be good or bad. 

Dude, I should write scripts for those Lifetime original movies. XD Ahahaha.

This post isn't finished, but DC-chan just called and she talks my ear off constantly, so it's impossible for me to continue. ~_~;"

"event","DC Chan and I went to the Astroworld, with Samuel and his friend Izea (I know I butchered his name... ""Eye-zey-uh""). Very fun. It was so boss. We rode on...everything...and we were checking out all the boiz. XD

Everytime a cute guy passed us, we started beaten the general area on our chests of our hearts, and said ""My little heart goes pitter-pat!"" And they'd all look at us and kind of grin and blush. Well, the bashful ones did. Most of them were looking at us like ""Shut up. I'm better than you.""

Yeah... Nothing really crazy that stood out happened, unfortunately. u_u;

I took a hot bath, with vanilla bubbles. Wee. I smell nice. =D

Yep. So, I developed some pictures from our school dance... But only the ones of me. They're on the ExoQui journal. :O

An irrelevant note on my current music that has been on repeat for the past hour and a half (taken from RealOne Player homepage, I think... www.real.com ?): She won't live up to her sister. XD But it's a good song, though she needs to improve her overall writing skills. Yep. Look at me, acting like I'm an expert - the one that didn't make it to Regions. >P"

So I sent her a picture of <lj-cut text=""Kyo with braces""><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v311/dandelionaide/kyo40.jpg""></lj-cut> (click there, stupid. XD), and I was like ""the pictures kind of big, and he has this weird look on his face... kinda creepy... kinda..."" because she doesn't know much about Diru, and isn't used to their looks... </P>
<P>So she clicks, and we agree that his braces don't look like braces... I'm not even sure if they're braces anymore... then DC Chan goes ""That's messed up; it's scary! o_O;"" and I go ""No, look at the braces, not his face!""</P>
<P>We started laughing so hard... I guess it's not as funny written down, but it was hilarious. It was the way I said it, I guess.</P>
<P>Yeah. Haven't finished Gravitation yet... o_o I'm on Track 8... or something. But I like it! I was like ""Awww"" at the part when Yuki cried; and I laughed when Shuichi was crossdressing... my brother came in and told me to shut up. XD Then there was that part with Ryuichi, keeping beat with the song when he and NG are on that show with Bad Luck, and it looks like his body is twitching... He looked hot in that scene. I don't know why. I mean, it looked like he was having spasms, but I squealed. XD I'm so weird.</P>
<P>But other than that, the series is kind of mediocre. I don't know what the big deal is all about - but I guess I have to go farther into the series, to witness it's BEAUTY AND MASTERPIECE-NESS. &gt;_&gt;;; </P>"

I actually got back yesterday, but I didn't update because I was so busy calling everyone, giving everyone their gifts I bought, describing the trip (highlighting Tia Nena and Michael's annoyances), celebrating my BIRTHDAY!!!, and just enjoying the simple pleasure of being HOME! There's no place like home! :)</P>
<P>I got some shirts, money, a portable DVD player (whoo hoo!), and a portable F harddrive. I've been watching Gravitation on the portable DVD player, even though I have one practically to myself with a much bigger screen in the game room.</P>
<P>So... yeah, new layout! You like it? I do! The original script was made by <lj user=""_xxshort_supply"" /> - thank you (again)! More information at the right. :D</P>
<P>This guy on the layout is so cute though, isn't he? Uber pretty, and sexy! Made in Adobe Photoshop - My love! We have been apart too long! ^^</P>
<P>OK, so a quick update. Nothing's happened.</P>
<P>Well, actually, DC-chan and I will probably going to Six Flags Astroworld (Houston's amusement park) - all alone, except for Samuel (brother) and his friend - who's really cute - but they'll leave us alone, or probably join us in our little ""We're-having-fun-so-screw-you"" antics.

"event","<P>Okay, lovies, the moment you've all been waiting for has arrived...!! .</P>
<P>..No, I have not yet found naked pictures of Die. (BUT THE SEARCH CONTINUES FORTH!) </P>
<P>It's the next best thing! I'm leaving! Yeah, that was putting myself down, but I'm good at it. e_e;; Okay, so, I'll be in California for the next two weeks (until the 28th), and during that time my birthday will pass.</P>
<P>July 23.</P>
<P>I will not divulge in the information of my age. Sorry. I know, you probably don't care, and you can probably tell my age already, but... Weh, I won't spoil your image of me just yet. So, if you'd like to keep track of my goings-on in California, feel free to add or watch or bookmark exotic_quixotic.</P>
<P>For now, that will be my journal for what goes on in California. Why, you might ask? Well, because this LJ is for Computer Kikasa JULY 23 and Computer Totchi. It feels odd to cheat on them, with Tia Angie and Tio Paco (not you, Justin. XD)'s computer, Computer Melon (don't ask). So yeah... After the trip, exotic_quixotic will become a LJ where I divulge and indulge in my creative fantasies - not in the JULY 23 perverted way. In the ""Holy-Shit-I-Read-Too-Much-Para-Kiss-Today""</P>
<P>way... yeah. Little Photoshop graphics and clothing designs galore! FEAR IT.</P>
<P>Yep, so... Please add. u_u;; Or at least read. I need friends. u.u</P>
<P>So... yeah. God, am I going to miss staying on the computer all day JULY 23. Going to miss Photoshop, Yahoo!, AIM, POSTING, and the mp3 rotations... x_x;; I'm worried about the flight too (I have a fear of flying), so everyone, please wish me a good flight and a good trip -- and a good doctor's visit, because that's one of the reasons I'm going to California (he's so cute)!</P>
<P>I'll miss you~! &lt;3<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh, also, because I had too much time on my hands yesterday, and was excited about a new role play I started, where I was playing Ayumi with a Gackt, I made a Gackt x Ayumi ...graphic... in Photoshop. So, go LJ cut!</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Revealing my Inner Gackt x Ayumi Fangirlism. I be representin', foo'!""> </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v311/dandelionaide/gacktayu.jpg""></P>
<P>Took me a while, because those 4 images were seperate... and the original one I had made was using just the pictures of Ayumi and Gackt (the clear images at the bottom), and&nbsp;use a constant fade effect... make it look dreamy&nbsp;and stuff, but then I&nbsp;foudn those&nbsp;other pictures of them, where Gackt and Ayumi's heads were tilted at the same angle (though Gackt seems to always have his head like that...&nbsp;o_O;), and was&nbsp;all ""Waiiiii!&nbsp;MUST USE!""... All in all, plans were changed...</P>
<P>So, I decided all this (in about 30 minutes xD)...&nbsp;and I had to cut them from their respective images, clean them up (because the edges were kind of messed up, because my magnetic lasso tool doesn't like me), put them togethr, clean them up so their edges didn't clash on each other, do the fade effect for the side pictures, clean THOSE up, use some brushes (credit: <A href=""http://www.echoica.net/"">Echoica</A>), and then just do the text... e_e; I'm happy with the outcome, even though the brushes showing on Gackt's neck look...odd; not in a bad way though - I like it; though the people I've showed it to them could be a BIT more enthusiastic. Care to critique?</P>
<P>So anyway, off to finish Making Out (a book series, not actually ...doing it... XD)... </P>

"event","I just remembered some funny stuff that happened at the mall yesterday...

We were in the Men's Section of Dillards (we got lost XDD), so we're pointing out all the ""Oooh aah ahh"" hot guys in the posters of models posing in the clothes (because we needed something to occupy ourselves with since we were...like, you know. Lost). So we get to this one poster, in the center of these ties that we were going to buy for Justi--I mean, Paco (ha ha! XD), and it's this man (wearing a flamboyant tie- go figure! XD) with this little boy on his knee, and as if that wasn't bad enough already, I suddenly realize (and this is quoting):

""OH MY GOD! [FADE-SAN]! THAT LOOKS LIKE TOUGA'S FOSTER-FATHER FROM THE MOVIE!"" ...which would be me.

""...Wha? OH MY GOD!"" ...is her.

So we kind of skitter away, because the resemblance (and position -snicker-) was frightening.

Then we find our way back, and go into Sam Goody (which is a music and video store, for those who don't know). Fade-san had told me earlier that she'd never heard of the band ""H.I.M."" so I'm looking for the CD to show her. She comes over from the anime section, and is like ""What are you looking for?"" and I told her I'm looking for the H.I.M. CD, but then I give up because it's obviously not there.

So we're leaving, and this guy (he must have been about 16) comes up to us and goes ""Hey, you know what band I used to be a part of?""

We blink.

He continues: ""KISS! Yeah, that's right. KISS.""

We're scared, so we leave. Later, when we're laughing about it, Fade-san goes, ""It's only because I made eye contact that he approached us. It was that one little moment of intimacy that made him see us as worthy prey!"" It was funny. XD

Yeah... It was funny then, but now I can't really smile. I feel bad, because I'm putting one of my internet-friends on a guilt trip, and now he's depressed for one reason or another, and I just hope it wasn't me, because I seem to have done that to enough people for one day.... (yeah, Fade-san got mad at me today...which is why she didn't spend the night again) So I'm trying to get him to tell me to go away, because otherwise I'll just stay and bother him some more, but he's not doing it.

I was happy just a few minutes ago, now I'm depresed. I guess I'll blame it on Aunt Flo. >>"

"event","Went to the mall with Fade-san today. She got Alice the 19th #5 (or was it #4?) and Fushigi Yuugi #11. I got Paradise Kiss #s 2 and 3. They look weird next to book 1, because book 1 is with the old style - single colored; 2 and 3 are white with their respective volume colors. Yeah... You have to see the books to get what I mean; I guess I'll take a picture and slap it on here, when I get a new camera.

So after we created havoc in Waldenbooks and B. Dalton's, we went to Starbucks. We didn't order anything, just sat in the corner table (right next to the speaker playing this CRAPTACULAR music), and indulged ourselves in some [sarcasm] very fun, very exciting PEOPLE WATCHING![/sarcasm] You've never lived until you've people-watched. There was this girl with some nice lime-green hair; we told her we liked it and she laughed and gave us the brand of hair dye and bleach she used. I have no use for it, as my hair's too dark and any color other than brown seems weird with my skintone, but Fade-san was all excited... she screamed ""GOD BLESS YOU!"" at the girl's back when she walked away. 'Twas funny.

Went to the horse race's yesterday (technically two days ago, since it's midnight now, but... Peh. Fine, we went on Saturday); the first race we saw, ""I had a feeling"" about number 5 - it's name was Great Example (wahoo!) - and it won! Fade-san and her dad were betting for different horses, but Fade-san backed out when her horse got 7th place, so only her dad gave me his money ($1 dollar, but hey! Better than nothing! XD).

So Fade-san spent the night, we went to the mall... yadda yadda, we went over that already.

Umm... Trying to persuade some people to role play with me, but they all have some kind of excuse. 

Is there something wrong with my RP or something? x_x; That kind of depressed me, but what doesn't these days?

I just turned on the TV and MAURY is on. YES! I haven't seen it in such a long time, and I love this show (because I'm a dork). The current topic is... ""I confess... I've cheated on you 300 times!"" I think that's kind of odd. It's like ""You've been counting? o_o""

A girl fell in his lap. Yeah, suuuuure. He's like ""Those panties [my girlfriend] found under my car weren't mine, they belonged to my mother."" HA HA. No duh they're not yours; it was a flower-printed thong! His mother's... Oh my God.

So he took a lie detector test, and the results are that yes, he was cheating on her, and she ran off the stage. >_>

If it wasn't for all the drama, this show would be my favorite show EVAR. That's not an anime, of course. XD

"event","Well, as some of you might know (because I AM aware that some of you weirdos read this damn thing!), I have many a phobia. Some ar (moderately) harmless, such as... arachnaphobia, and the rather minimal dose of OCD.

But then, others that were gained rather recently - in the source of the word - have been ruining my social life...which is my life in general. Such as: phone phobia, stranger phobia, and internet phobia.

Phone phobia - I do not like calling people. I only like people calling me.

Stranger phobia - Meeting new people is a horrible experience for me. This is equivalent to social phobia and its components.

Internet phobia - Hard to explain. I try too hard to impress people, which sometimes makes me lie. And that has very bad repurcussions. x_x;;

But anyway, back to the point of this post:

My internet phobia is diminishin! Wahoo! I'm actually asking people if they'll add me, regardless if I really know them or not; just because they seem cool in the posts I've seen them do in journals, communities, profiles, or their Friends Only comments. e_e;; I feel so liberated!"

"event","Today has been a rather good day. Nothing to really complain about.<br>
<br>
I slept until 2 PM. I feel rested, but haven't done anything with that
energy, except ran around chasing Cleo(patra) for a while. That was
very fun, until she left to go explore our front yard with Pebbles. <br>
Anyway. My father also made me some Macaroni and Cheese, without me
having to ask him. I feel so loved. Yeah, it's the little, stupid
things that make my day. And, just to make your day, here's someone
giving the God, Gackt, a blow job! XDD<br>

I'm still using my Xanga, so if you want really frequent updates (but not enough to be actually considered a ""journal entry""), head on over to the following URL: www.xanga.com/s7venstarbox . Yeey.

I think my Xanga will just be for the people that know me in real life, because they're the only ones that look at it anyway, and it's already full with a bunch of emotional sh!t... I think this LJ will be full of my current obsessions, memoirs, and over all place for my ""intelligent"" thoughts. XDDD;;

So. Better start acting intelligent.

Hello, my good chap. Fanficul weather we're having, isn't it? 

...Yeah, that was gayer than a box of crayons. ._. Sorry. XDDD"

"event","First post -- uhh... yey? Just finished reading a Kyo x Shinya fanfic. Hm. Not a pairing I like, but the description of the settings and everything was very good - very well written over all...

I don't know what else to write, except I'm going to join some communities now. First on the list: Die x Shinya! 
Weeeeee.

Excuse the lack of a fancy layout. Rachel is lazy. XD"

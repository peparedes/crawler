"event","Okay.. so I had a great time at Kamp Motor Speedway.  I returned home, unloaded the car and tried to fire it up.  I had the exact same problem again with the new starter!

<lj-cut text=""more details inside specially marked packages!"">
So.. I took the car to a local hot rodder's shop to get a new gasket put in the intake manifold (oil leak), have the shifter lever re-attached and see what they could do to help me with the starter.

They suggested mounting a stock starter to real tight tolerances, measured and mounted carefully.  They said they had done this with a street rod with real high compression ratio and never had a problem.  I dropped the car off and waited to hear back from them.

It took them till Saturday morning for me to pick it up - which of course was the day of the practice at Fairbury.

We fired the car up at the shop prior to loading it and everything seemed to work fine.  They timed the motor, after having removed the distributor for the intake manifold installation.  And then we shut it down for loading.  I found out then that the lights had been on in the trailer, so of course the battery was dead.  I went back to the house to load up for my trip, and I was nervous about unloading the racecar due to the dead battery in the trailer.  (I wasn't aware that the truck was charging the battery as it ran, so I probably could have unloaded.)  Anyway, I only loaded up a few hand tools that I thought I would need to air up the tires, tighten down some bolts, etc.  I didn't load up the whole tool chest because it was in the garage, which would require unloading the racecar.  This would prove to be an unwise move.

When I got to the track, it started sprinkling immediately after unloading. :(  So I loaded back up...  then it stopped again, so I unloaded.  I got the car ready and went to fire it up - same damned problem!  I was very frustrated.  I went to find a track official and asked if I could get push-started just to turn some laps, and was told that wouldn't be a problem.  So I changed quickly into my gear and with some help pushed the car back away from the trailer.

I climbed in and got a push start.  Now.. this was my first time getting a push start.  And it's not a real ""smooth"" process.  But we managed to get it going, knock it out of high gear and then move on over to the staging area.

When I got out onto the track, I shifted up into high gear without any problems (whew!) and waited for the green flag.  It was just me and another guy, so I could really enjoy myself and try some things.  I felt the car pushing real bad in turn 2, not wanting to turn to the left even before I got on the gas.  I think it might have been the shape of the turn, though, and I suspect there's something I can do with my driving to fix that.  The other guy on the track spun out probably 3 or 4 times during out laps, so I'm not really sure how many green flag laps I ran.  But before I knew it, the white flag was displayed as I exited turn 4.

This is when my problems started.  I had turned lap after lap with very few incidents and hardly getting out of shape.  Meanwhile my lap-mate had spun out repeatedly.  So I decided I needed to push it a little, see what I could do.  And push it I did.  The car started to move forwards at an angle as I gave it a little more gas, the rear end trying to move to the right a bit as it pushed the car forwards.  I countersteered to keep the car going straight, but I didn't really lift off the gas pedal - hoping the tires would continue to get more and more forward grip.  But it just didn't happen fast enough and (in my head) <I>""come on come on come on come on""</I> *BAM* I smacked the wall with the right rear.  The car bounced off the wall and spun around, clipping the right front against the wall in the process.  I came to rest facing backwards in the entrance to turn 1.

The track workers ran over to see if I was okay - I was, just mad at myself - and then they hooked up the rear of the car to a tow truck.  Here's something I bet you didn't know - when they're towing your car by the rear, you have to keep the steering wheel straight ahead or else the car will ""wander"" a bit.  Yeah, I looked like a goof, but it didn't do any damage.  They just had to stop the tow truck and come back to tell me to hold the wheel straight.

When I got to my trailer and was lowered off the tow truck, that's when I really began to get alarmed.  How was I going to repair this thing so I could load it onto the trailer?!?  I didn't even have any of my air tools to remove a tire!  Fortunately a good friend brought over his crew and helped me out quite a bit.  They disconnected the driveshaft as it was pinned against the rollcage.  We changed the tire since a wheel was bent and from there were able to load it up.  I brought the trailer back to Lockport and parked it in the yard, where it sat pretty much until September or October.

A week ago Saturday, my buddy - George - and I climbed under the racecar and removed some broken or bent pieces.  My parts list is kinda long, but it's not too formidable.  I took some pics, though, of the damage...

Well.. that's about it!  It's not really that bad.  The parts are kinda pricey - Driveshaft $150, and the rear wheel $125, the prices go down from there.

Hope you enjoyed!  I didn't enjoy hitting the wall, but I did enjoy the laps up to that point.

Well, things never go smoothly, do they?  After the race party, we went to work on my car over at Tim's place.  We un-winterized it, reconnecting fuel lines, batteries, radiator hose, filling up the water...  clutch line, steering fluid, you name it we topped it off and/or hooked it up.

Then it came time to try to start it.  I had had problems at the end of the fall when I tried to fire the car up one last time before winterizing it.  It turns out the starter mounting was a little ""rigged"" - forcing a ""straight bolt"" starter into a ""staggered bolt"" mount.  We worked on it and worked on it, but weren't able to get it to consistently turn the motor.

We headed over to the track for the practice session in hopes that the parts guy would have the right kind of starter.  He didn't. :(  My day ended early.  I didn't even unload the car.  I did, however, manage to gouge up my vinyl floor in the trailer and ding up the tool chest by forgetting to strap it to the wall. Doh!

I headed home and prepared to do the best I could.  I bought a starter at my local Speed Shop and tried to get it to work.  It didn't.  I bought a starter from a central Illinois parts company, and instead of trying to install it and tearing it up... I got rescued.

The guy I bought the car from and his father used to do the racing thing together.  But when the driver found out he was going to be a daddy, he decided he was either ""in it"" or ""out of it"" as far as racing was concerned.  So he sold off most everything but some tools.  He and his dad really enjoyed working on the car together, so when I talked to him about some of the challenges I had, they encouraged me to bring the car down to Villa Grove where they could do some work on it.  I picked up a new flywheel, brought my new starter and - on my birthday - loaded up the dogs after work and drove the 3.5 hours to Villa Grove.  We pulled off the old starter and flywheel, then I unhooked my trailer and drove back to Lockport, returning home at about 1am.

The following Saturday, I drove down to Villa Grove and picked up my now-running racecar! :D
(It was more complicated than that...  when we first tried to fire it up, one of the starter bolts just popped right out, so we replaced it with a longer one.  Then I drove the car down an alley and worked to get it into high gear, practice putting it into reverse, etc.  It doesn't drive at all like a street car.)

So, from Villa Grove I loaded up and drove another 3 hours to Boswell, IN - home of Kamp Motor Speedway.

I was all alone at Kamp, which proved to be somewhat intimidating.  I hadn't a clue what I was doing.  I wheeled out the generator, but then the plug for the trailer didn't fit the outlet on the generator. :P  I got everything out, though, and got into my fire suit.  I fired up the car and let it run for a bit, checked my tire pressures and headed out to turn some laps.

My laps were enjoyable and for the most part uneventful.  I stayed down low to keep from screwing up the other five drivers on the track.  It was a wild sensation seeing Tommy Kroll (somewhat famous around here) go around the outside, about two stories higher than where I was running.  One guy I saw had spun out early in the session, and then I saw him go tearing around me a few laps later.  I had a feeling he might be out of control, and I was right.  He looped it not a half turn ahead of me, forcing me to think fast.  I hit the brakes, but.. they don't work quite like passenger car brakes.. And then I realized I was about to stall the motor cause it was locked into gear.  So I got back on the gas and tried to whip around him to the right.  I looked as best I could to see if anyone was coming, but you have very limited vision inside the racecar.  As soon as I got around the guy, I swung back down to get back out of the way.  At this point, I think I got some mud on my tires, and I swung back and forth probably three times, spooking the drivers who were moving along outside me.  One made a motion with his hand, but I got things back under control.  I later went to him and explained what had happened and how that was my first time on the track.  I apologized for spooking him, and he said not to worry about it - everyone had to start somewhere.

So.. I turned my laps.  And then I found out I had a problem.  There was oil leaking from the back of the intake manifold.  A neighboring racer helped me diagnose it and then loaned me a tube of sealant to try to ""patch"" it up.  I did just that and let the car sit before going out to turn more laps.

The second set of laps, I had a tough time getting started.  First, I wasn't paying attention while putting it into reverse (have to lean on the shifter handles to keep them from making contact with the driveshaft) and the driveshaft caught the shifters.. caused the interior sheet metal to ""lurch"" and the engine to stop.  I got out and checked things over, determined nothing had broken and fired it back up.  When I got out onto the track in low gear, I tried to switch into high and couldn't get it to go.  Then I couldn't get it to go BACK into low.. so I was coasting to a stop in turns 3/4.  The push truck was just pulling up behind me when I finally got it to go into low.. pulled away and easily shifted into high.  :P

When I got back into the pits, I had some good news and some bad news... good news - the oil leak appeared to be mostly stopped.  The bad news - I had managed to knock the reverse shifter lever loose which is probably why I was having a tough time with the gears.

I waited around a bit - nervous about backing my trailer out - and took some photos before departing.  It was a long drive back to Lockport, and I spent probably the first hour and a half just calling anyone and everyone I could think of to tell them about my first laps in my racecar.

All in all, I can't begin to describe how great it felt to finally be turning laps.

"event","It's now March of 2004, and I'm getting ready for the 2004 racing season.  I had some fun last year, but came to an abrupt stop when I made some contact with the wall.  It wasn't that the contact was very big (as you'll see in photos), but I had just bought a house, TV, DVD player, washer, dryer, fridge, dishwasher, air conditioner, lawn mower, garage door and garage door opener.  I bought much of it on 12 months same as cash and wanted to pay those bills off before I spent money on racecar parts.  Had I not hit the wall, I would have continued racing using cash for fuel and pit passes.  But once I needed to buy some parts, I decided to park it.

Without further ado, I'll post a few entries related to last spring:

<lj-cut text=""The Tim O'Donnell Race Party, March 29, 2003"">

The Tim O'Donnell Race Party, March 29, 2003.

Tim has been a great friend, patient teacher, generous mentor and all around great racer.  I hooked up with him via an internet message board and he has totally welcomed me to his program.  I've visited with him on race nights, worked on my car in his shop, brought my tranny to him for a rebuild, etc.  So when he set up his race party as a fundraiser, I figured the least I could do was bring my car down to put on display and help out with the fundraiser as needed.

First some pictures of all the cars:

<lj-cut text=""come see the photos!"">
First, last Tuesday - right before my surgery - when I didn't have a chance to update, I took the following:

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/frontleftdoor01.jpg"">Front left door, notice the gap between the footbox and the door panel</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/frontleftdoor02.jpg"">Same view, zoomed out</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/frontrightdoor01.jpg"">Right side view</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/rearleftquarter01.jpg"">Kind of a cool shot of the left rear</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/rearrightquarter01.jpg"">And the right rear</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/rearpanelwhoops01.jpg"">A slip-up... this panel is supposed to be 'minimum 8 inches', which means this 18 inch panel will slow me down like a sail</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/fuelflapwhoops01.jpg"">Another slip-up... I asked for a fuel flap door instead of a cut-out.  I like the clean look of the flap and I don't like having to reach into that little hole to open up the fuel tank.</A>

They said they would address the fuel flap, the 8 inch panel and the ignition box... and later when I called them about the gap between the foot box and the door, they said they'd take care of that, too.

Today when I went by, the fuel flap is being fixed, the ignition box is fixed and the footbox is now smoothly connected to the driver's side door.  The rear panel will be trimmed down to 8 inches.  Things are coming along nicely!!

So, today's pics:
<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/NewNoseAndHood01.jpg"">The new nose and hood pieces</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/NewNoseAndHood02.jpg"">A slightly different view of the nose and hood</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/NewHoodAndDoor01.jpg"">Nose, hood and door.. notice the big opening.  This is the reason why the 18 inch panel on the rearend just won't do.  The center of this car is just like a big wind tunnel</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/FixedDoorGap01.jpg"">This is the fixed door gap area.  You can kind of see all the lines and rivets around the roll cage bars where he had to patch together to cover the gap.  It looks fine, from my perspective.  That's just what you have to do to get around those roll cage bars.</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/FixedFuelFlap01.jpg"">Here's the new fuel cell door.  It's being installed right now.</A>

So, now all I'm waiting on is the fiberglass roof so they can put that on and build the window panels.  That, and a few trim and clean activities and it should be done!  They figure it'll be finished by the end of the week.

Okay, just a few more pics!
My latest package arrived - my new 38 lb. aluminum jack from Harbor Freight & Tools.
<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/Ayla-JackInTheBox.jpg"">First, Ayla had to sniff it to make sure it was up to snuff, I guess.</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/Bubba-JackInTheBox.jpg"">Then it was Bubba's turn to sniff the jack-in-the-box. ... big scaredy cat. ;)  </A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/NewJack01.jpg"">So here's the new jack!!! Doesn't it just LOOK fast? ;) Note: Ayla is unimpressed.</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/NewJack02.jpg"">Slightly extended...</A>

Okay, I hope you enjoyed the pics!

<lj-cut text=""pics ahead!!!"">

Last Wednesday (a week ago this past Wednesday) my racecar got a lift over to Bill's Speed Shop.  They didn't do a lot with the car that first week, but Monday and Tuesday they began removing the old body panels.  When I stopped over Tuesday night they were just about done with that.

This is what I saw:
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/BareCar01.jpg"">
<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/BareCar02.jpg"">Another Angle</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/BareCar03.jpg"">I believe you'd call this an 'open cockpit'?</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/BareCar04.jpg"">Ugly, beat up but functional fuel cell and tail body support</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/BareCar05.jpg"">Bare right side</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/FuelCellandRearBar01.jpg"">They are talking about replacing that tail body support.. I'll be replacing the fuel cell next season</A>

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/UncoveredRearSuspension01.jpg"">The rear suspensions on these cars are so wild!  In addition to springs and shocks over each wheel, what you see here is a combination of two shocks at the top and a ""bar"" on the bottom with two rubber ""biscuits"".  This set of hardware helps transition the weight of the car on and off the rear end when you stomp on the gas pedal.</A>

I went back by the shop this afternoon, since the power went out in the entire village of Hinsdale, including stop lights, and we all left work early.

First, the biggest 'safety enhancement' I have requested:
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/DoorPlates01.jpg"">
The new steel door plates (the silver squares welded into the criss cross of blue roll cage tubing) should help prevent entry of ""foreign objects"" into my left side. :\  A worthy improvement, don't you think?

<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/NewCockpit03.jpg"">
They've already built most of the cockpit and a little bit of the decking.  He's finishing off some pieces around the instrument/gauge panels right now.

<A HREF=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/newmetal/NewCockpitWhoops.jpg"">Whoops!  The ignition box(?) isn't supposed to be sticking out of the dash panels.  But, fortunately that area is covered by the hood once it is in place.  Tom (the guy doing the work) will be boxing that in with a sort of ""power bulge"" like you'd see on a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  But, it shouldn't really be a big deal.</A>

And that, my friends, is what has been happening at the speed shop!!!

I really didn't want to go this ""big"" on my purchase, but Don and Ray over at South Oak Dodge made it something I could afford, and I need to have a reliable truck when April 6th rolls around.  April 6th, in case you're wondering, is the first practice date I have planned to attend.  It will be at Danville, IL's Vermillion County Speedway.

"event","Well, a lot's been happening the last few months!

January 7th I ordered my new trailer from Interstate-1.  It should be ready in about a week.

February 1st I took my transmission down to Tim O'Donnell's place where I watched in wonder as he dismantled it piece by piece and re-assembled it with new clutch disks.  I got the transmission back into the car February 16th.

I've made some significant purchases - a Craftsman air compressor, an aluminum jack and many air tool accessories.

Then, Wednesday February 19th my racecar got a lift over to Bill's Speed Shop in Joliet, IL.  I've sent it to Bill's to get some safety enhancements and all new sheet metal.  (Cockpit, decking and body.)

And the most recent news would be that I purchased my new tow vehicle.  Saturday, February 22nd, I purchased a 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 Quad Cab 2X4 from South Oak Dodge.  They really set me up with exactly what I wanted, and at a price I could afford.  I'd highly recommend anyone else looking for a new Dodge or any used vehicle to go check them out.  They're in Matteson, IL.

Look to the next few posts to see some photos of the racecar over at Bill's and my new truck!

"event","Well, for the past several weeks I've contemplated, questioned, considered and examined the removal of the transmission from my racecar.  I knew when I bought the car that it would need a new clutch.  Now it's time to get the transmission out so I can take it down to Tim O'Donnell's.  He's told me he'll show me how to replace the clutch so that I can do it myself next time.

As in the past, Tim, Heather and the members over at http://www.4m.net proved invaluable in helping me understand what it would take to get the transmission out and how to avoid pitfalls in the process.

<lj-cut text=""Details and photos (ooooooh!!!) inside"">The first step was to drain the transmission.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/transmission%20clutch%20connection%20and%20drain%20LR.jpg""><BR>
You can see the drain at the bottom of the transmission case.  It required a 3/8"" allen wrench, a tool I did not yet own until this weekend.  The next step was to disconnect the clutch line.  I was attempting to keep as much of the fluid inside the line as possible.  I'd purchased a rubber stopper with the intent to plug the end of the line with that.  Unfortunately, the actual mount was shaped much different on the inside than it appeared from the outside.  I think I lost most of the clutch fluid.  I ended up putting a couple of pieces of tape over the tip, which was pretty ineffective, and then setting the end of the clutch line up someplace higher than the fluid reservoir.  You can see the place where the clutch line joins the transmission.  It's a sorta cylinder-shaped projection out of the back of the main casing.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/clutch%20line%20unsuccessful%20LR.jpg""><BR>
(The clutch line hanging over a cage bar.)

The next step was to disconnect the back of the driveshaft from the rear end gear.  I was warned that there were some ""caps"" being held on by the u-bolts that I'd be removing.  And that should one of these caps be dropped, there were needle bearings inside that would be a bear to repack.  As it turns out, I may likely end up replacing the parts anyway for reliability's sake.  But I was careful to try my best not to dislodge the caps.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/rearend%20u%20bolts%20LR.jpg""><BR>
These are the u-bolts.  They are just in front of the rear end gear.  I've already removed the driveshaft in this picture.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/driveshaft%20with%20caps%20secured%20LR.jpg""><BR>
This is the back end of the driveshaft.  I wrapped some duct tape around the u-joint to keep the caps secure.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/driveshaft%20front%20end%20LR.jpg""><BR>
This is the front of the driveshaft.  I had to slide it out of the back of the transmission once it was disconnected from the rear gear.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/back%20of%20transmission%20LR.jpg""><BR>
This is the back of the transmission.  The front end of the driveshaft slid directly into this opening.

The next step was to disconnect the shift linkages.  Aside from some dirt, grime and awkward angles under the car.  This wasn't too much of a challenge.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/shift%20linkages%20LR.jpg""><BR>
Here's the place where the linkages connect to the transmission.  These are the arms that connect to the actual shift lever you push and pull with your hand (the ""stick"" in stick shift).

I came back later, after getting the transmission completely out, and zip-tied the linkage rods to a frame crossmember so that they don't drag on the ground.  I am probably going to be moving the car while the transmission is out, so I thought I'd do that now before I forgot.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/shift%20linkages%20secured%20LR.jpg""<BR>
The gold-colored rods waving their way up diagonally across the photo are the rods in question.  You can see the bottom end of the shifting levers showing through the cockpit sheet metal.

Next I had to remove four bolts that hold the transmission to the bellhousing.  Some of the bolts were rather difficult to get at due to the small gaps between the bolt and the transmission casing.  I picked up a new socket set for the job, and it worked pretty well.  The bellhousing is the bright orange piece shown in this picture.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/bellhousing%20LR.jpg""><BR>
The four steel bolts shown are what holds the transmission in place, really.  Here's the front of the transmission, where the output from the motor is translated to input into the transmission.
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/front%20of%20transmission%20LR.jpg""><BR>
You might be able to see how the protruding front of the transmission is ridged to slide into the hole shown beyond the bellhousing.

After that, I just had to wrestle the transmission out from the bellhousing and lower it down to the ground.  It weights about 40 or 45 lbs., which isn't a lot, but there's not a lot of room to work underneath the car.  Plus the shifting linkages were still hanging around and chose this moment to drop down near my face. :P

So, here's what a Brinn racing transmission looks like, out from underneath the car:
<IMG SRC=""http://www.racing73.com/misc_debris/lj/racing73/brinn%20out%20LR.jpg""><BR>

Hope you enjoyed the photo-journal.  I know I am glad to have this first-time experience checked off my list and am eagerly awaiting the rebuild.

"event","Well, I bought the car Sept. 28, 2002.  It took me about two or three weeks to get everything situated in the garage - OSB flooring in the attic, 190-ish inch-wide shelves across the back wall of the garage, pegboard and hooks along the sides for yard implements, bikes, etc.

Tim O'Donnell and his father assisted greatly by going with me in Tim's truck, with Tim's trailer, over to the pole barn.  We loaded up the racecar, drove the 3 hours to my home, unloaded it, and drove the 3 hours back to Tim's place.  It was a long day for me, as I drove the total distance twice.  But finally the racecar was in place.

During the trip I got an opportunity to continue quizzing Tim about tools, repairs, maintenance, everything and anything.  I also shared with him some of my ideas about motorsports marketing and finances.  I hope to someday be able to show my appreciation to Tim through either my business and marketing skills or even help at the track."

"event","Well, I didn't just wake up one day and decide to buy a racecar.  So I figured I'd take some time and explain how it is I got to this point, how did I prepare, what experiences do I have.

<lj-cut text=""Preparation and Education"">I grew up in Central Pennsylvania.  Just 3 miles from my house was a Saturday night dirt track called Silver Springs Speedway.  http://www.silverspringspeedway.com/  They raced ""Sportsman"" sprint cars - basically a 358 ci sprint car with a small top wing and no front wing - along with Limited Late Models and Street Stocks.  We would usually go to the track whenever my grandfather came to visit, as he used to help on a pit crew closer to home ""back in the day"".  Another nearby track was much more famous.  About 15 miles from my house, on Friday nights, you could go see 410 and 358 sprints running at Williams Grove Speedway.  http://www.williamsgrove.com/

I moved off to college, where my trips to the racetrack were very few and very far between, but whenever I got an opportunity my younger brother and I would head back to Silver Springs.  After school I moved down to Jacksonville, FL.  The local track - Jax Raceways - was a bit different from what I knew in Central PA.  They never ran sprint cars, raced on basically ""oiled sand"" and ran Late Models, Grand American Modifieds, Hobby Stocks, Street Stocks, Pure Stocks and Powder Puff classes.  All those stock cars I couldn't really tell the difference.  But the Late Models and Modifieds were fairly fun to watch.  I discussed with  my wife at the time that in a few years I'd like to buy a Modified, spend a season just taking it out to Thursday night practice sessions, and then after lots of laps alone I'd start racing.  My job in Florida went away, and so did that plan.

Which takes me to Chicagoland area.  I moved here in March 2001.  That first year I ventured out to Fairbury American Legion Speedway, Wilmot Speedway and Kankakee Motor Speedway.  Wilmot was somewhat disappointing as it was a flat pancake oval.  Kankakee was impressive, but ran on Friday nights.  Fairbury put on a good show, too, but they ran on Saturday nights.

In 2002 I was introduced to http://www.4m.net by a friend on livejournal.  From there I asked if anyone was willing to let me hang out in their pit and watch, ask questions, help wherever possible.  I was invited to join Tim O'Donnell, driver of the T33, at Fairbury's season opener.  Throughout the next several months, I spent time at Fairbury with Tom Jensen, #41; at Farmer City and Kankakee with Tim O'Donnell and some time at Farmer City with John Hudson, #H66.  I also got to talk with several other drivers.  I asked questions galore of Tim and Tom and they patiently answered them for me.  I set tire pressures, changed tires, refueled the cars, whatever it was that needed to be done and was in my limited knowledge of auto mechanics.

I tried to go to a racing school, only to have it canceled on me twice at the last minute.  $200 in United Airlines change fees and I still haven't turned a lap. :P  But the plan is to go to as many season opening practices as possible, maybe even go to a track on my own for a practice day if possible.  Then when the season starts, I'll introduce myself, let people know I'm new and planning on starting ""scratch"" on the field whenever I'm out there... I'll let them know that if they spin and go to the tail, they should come back around me before the restart so I can stay back there and work on turning consistent laps.  When I'm able to race my way past a few cars and into the middle third of the field, it'll then be time to start racing from my earned qualifying position.

Sound like a plan?  I hope so!"

"event","Back in September, I started seriously looking for a racecar.  <lj-cut text=""the details are in here"">I was spreading the word earlier in the year that I'd be looking to buy someone's used equipment after the season was over.  I got a call from Roger Friedman about his son's car.  I spent some serious time considering it, but in the end had to tell Roger that - while he was selling a very nice racecar at a reasonable price - it would be biting off more than I could chew if I were to buy it from him.

I had made some friends in the racing world, the Hudsons, who were expecting a baby.  John decided he was either going to be ""100% into racing"" or ""100% out"".  And, he was kinda worn out from all the hard work it takes to keep the car running two or three nights a week.  He was selling a similar deal to the Friedmans, but then I mentioned that I didn't need and probably couldn't afford a car with such a nice motor under the hood.  John put together a package that was just perfect for me.  He pulled his primary motor and put in his backup motor and sold the package to me at a price that was just right.  The backup motor isn't built out of ""cheap"" parts, it's just built out of less expensive parts.  It should last the season with little or no maintenance.  But it probably won't be setting any qualifying records - even if it had a track champion sitting in it.

I drove down to their neck of the woods and took some pics of the car, checked it over and wrote John a check on Sept. 28th, 2002.  His in-laws were nice enough to let me store the car in one of their pole barns until I got my garage cleared out and organized for storing it there.

The following pics were taken that day at John's in-laws.

And me... in the car. :) <BR>

I owe the Hudsons a great big thanks.  John and Steph have expressed an interest in seeing their car run during the next year or two, occasionally stopping by the track to give some setup advice and things of that nature.  I look forward to having their company and perspective.

I am creating this journal as a way to document my efforts in racing and as a way to interact with fans, racers, friends and just those who might be curious about the hobby.  The first few entries will be 'catching you up' to where I am at this point.

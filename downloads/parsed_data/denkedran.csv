I'm a lazy blogger, in fact I'm not a blogger at all. You can follow my <a href=""http://latent.soup.io/"">Soup</a> instead.
I'm busy with my book, first I have to write some marketing-suitable abstracts, then format it. I'll be published in January '10 or earlier. 
I'm also looking for a new job and hope to find some before my company gets bought or insolvent or I get fired.

In 2,5 weeks there will be national elections. I'll surely vote for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Pirate_Party"">pirate party</a>, because I detest surveillance and and am very shocked about the step-by-step dismantling of of civil rights and our constitution by almost all of the other partys, our marvelous <a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany"">constitution</a> which is a condensed lesson our country learned from 12 years of nazi dictatorship.
(The very first article is the most important: ""The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority."")

"event","Yesterday, The Killer came to town ;-)

There were two bands playing before, one local band from Hamburg (including <a href=""http://www.schildkroete-live.de/"">this guy</a>) and some other with a girl on piano, who played good, but sang too decently.

After 1,5 hours Jerry Lee entered the stage and performed about 10 songs. 

<img src=""http://www.latent.de/Bildertage/2008-11-Nov/2008-11-01/01.jpg""/><img src=""http://www.latent.de/Bildertage/2008-11-Nov/2008-11-01/02.jpg""/><img src=""http://www.latent.de/Bildertage/2008-11-Nov/2008-11-01/03.jpg""/>

His vocal range may be reduced to one octave now, but his piano-playing is still surprisingly fast and accurate. Well, several times he speeded up the tempo a little bit - and the band followed him obidiently - but he has one skill that separates the wheat from the chaff: To know when to play what and to know how much and how sparse (<- booaaa, bad phrase). Especially in comparision to the two other bands who did'nt know how to create tension and relief and and what music that originated from blues is all about: You must not pay particularised and follow the chords while soloing. It's the tension between your tone and those three chords that makes your solo or fill-ins interesting. And its a matter of the dose of musical effects (e.g. the ongoing hammering on one tone) that make them effective. Jerry Lee Lewis still knows and knows how.

"event","In the (late) 80s I thought I was born too late, because I did not experience the cool 70s consciously outside my little child's world.
When I took a nap this afternoon and was dawning into sleep a picture came back, me riding the bus in San Francisco from the airport to downtown in summer 1989. A very special feeling was connected with that remembrance, something I can't describe in words, but it was kind of light-hearted and all-possibilities-there-for-me, without fear of the future. And being away from home but not feeling away from home.
Today I think the late 80s weren't that uncool and pity those young people who didn't experience that time. Pre-terror, pre-climate-change, pre-internet. (I still have a full shoebox of letters (yes, handwritten letters) from my early loves and I plan to take them with me to the old people's home. I won't take any E-mails or IM-chats with me.)

The worrying part is that I noticed again how the online-life has become a part of my own. Because of an error I was without the internet for one and a half day. And I felt like someone murdered my beloved pet.
Now that most things are faster I feel like I made a progress myself, like I achieved something I could be proud of.
What the hell. If some trees load faster in Second Life it makes me happy. If a video-stream is smoother I feel more capable. When I come home and there is no internet I feel like some burglar took away my cozy furniture.

"event","Other unimportant news: I found a luxembourg-1-cent-Euro-coin in my purse today. You might know that Euros have one identical side and one that's nation-specific. It's a game among us to collect the ""foreign"" Euro-coins that make their way into our purses - buying them at a coin-collectors-shop isn't allowed.
Luxembourg is a very tiny nation (1000 square miles) with 475.000 citizens (The city I live in has 1.745.000), so it's not very likely to find their coins in your purse and the 1-cent-coin is the rarest.
So I'm stupidly glad."

"event","<i>Life-insight #1</i>:
Everything I do, I do slower that others. I need more time to accompish things at a level I strive for, but I do - just at my own pace. Years are nothing to me.
When people estimate me they mostly characterize me as an unhurried and calm person. But 
firstly: The fewest can understand that someone can be ambitious and lazy at the same time, and
secondly: the fewest can imagine calmness as a strategy to counter stress situations or constellations.

<i>Life-insight #2</i>:
Since ever and for ever on I avoid competitious situations. Let there be a contest, a race for anything and I'll be gone. The slightest awareness of the chance to be measured in any scale evokes a shortening reaction. I even despise people who willingly fit themselves in into a competition. And when I can't avoid competition, I unconsciously boycott it by acting in an way that makes me fall out of the pattern for sure.

<i>Life-insight #3</i>:
My life is a good one altogether."

"event","Finally I replaced the HD with a new (and bigger) one and managed to copy-clone all the data to the new. A lot of screwing tiny screws.

Now I'm busy catching up two weeks of 21st century communication outage (which ist actually more consuming than communicating)."

"event","Last Friday my internal Harddrive got stuck. And I kind of freaked out, because I hadn't backed up my important data lately (except the very important data like my PhD-scripts - I'm stupid, but not that stupid). My laptop didn't boot, nothing, even booting from a DVD didn't work, only strange sounds from the HD. The next day I found out that if I lean the whole computer to the left or the right by turns I works with interruptions. So I was able to copy the important data to some other HD. Big relief. But now I'll have to wait until next Wednesday, when a friend comes with special equipment and we try to copy all the data including personal settings from the old to a new HD (a very few things have been easier before Macs got a Unix-System) I have no Computer at home and no Internet always at hand.

The only worrying thing about all that is, to what extent the computer and the internet became a part of my life: I almost felt like someone broke into my flat and stole half of my things. I felt partly helpless without the machine always running. Cut off from the world because my E-mails weren't checked every hour anymore and no new podcast coming in, no strolling through the usual sites, no editing of new photos and movies and no music downloading.

Addicted and committed, I'm a cyborg."

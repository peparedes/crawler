"event","I've started grad school. The thing of it all is that I had all of these expectations and fears but, in the long of it I haven't really seen what it is I thought I would. However, there was this strange realization, the same one I had when I started college that eventually petered out; the things we give into college is what we get out of it. 

The pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of how we know that knowledge has always been something that has driven me. Right now, having finished a bachelors by the skin of my teeth, I am confused. That confusion is leading to a variety of radical personality shifts and some gains in responsibility. It's strange. I find myself actually being the age I am. I think it's the first time in a long time that this has actually come to pass. I think the last time was what, when I was 10?

In any case, the lofty aspirations of my publication wants and dreams need to be grounded. For better or for worse, I am stuck where I am for 3 years at the least. So, with that in mind, I am trying to work up to a working definition and understanding of a few things; namely that of play, games, and leisure.

Johan Huizinga is probably the basis of all thought in the idea of play. There are other definitions and works, but from those i've spoken with, it's a good start. I'm concerned with a bunch of definitions; but namely I am thinking of 3 words, Play, Fun, and Game.
 
The first word i'm thinking of is play. Huizinga defines it as ""a voluntary activity or occupation executed within certain fixed limits of time and place, according to rules freely accepted but absolutely binding, having its aim in itself and accompanied by a feeling of tension, joy, and the consciousness that it is different from ordinary life.""

From there, we'll start building more."

"event","<b>Racist Tendencies and Stereotypes in MMORPG's: Final Fantasy 11</b>
This study is the result of two years of participant observation in the society of Final Fantasy 11 (FFXI), a fantasy genre based perpetual virtual world consisting of over 500,000 participants from around the world. Between 2004 and 2006, the author joined FFXI's players in each possible level of participation with other players and between groups of players. The formation of racially identified groups in this virtual world and the competition between them is the focus of this study. Through stereotypes and racially motivated behaviors such as name calling, accusations, and violence, these groups compete over in-game resources. From ""Nips,"" to ""Sand Niggers,""  ""RMTs"" to ""Botters,"" the terminology of this behavior often mimics those terms found offline. Competition over resources and lack of control over additional video game content allow the author to demonstrate the parallels of real world power structures that develop within Massively Multiplayer Game's separate from game design. 

So, here we go. I've finished one version of this paper and i'm going to have the second version of it complete by the end of this week. Next week I will finish my presentation and i will practice and hone it until it is old hat. I am scared shitless.

I suppose the natural flow of this paper goes something like this.

Intro
Lit Review
Methodology
Findings
Conclusions

Each section will be anywhere from 3-5 pages. The lit review is going to be rather extensive as when I wrote my initial paper it brought about a variety of emails and instant messages with book suggestions. As of right now, I am in possession of:

Race in Cyberspace"" Beth E. Kolko, Lisa Nakamura, and Gilbert B. Rodman
Technicolor: Race Technology, and Everyday Life Alondra Nelson Thuy Linh N. Tu Alicia Headlam Hines
Half Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds
Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games  by Edward Castronova
What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy James Paul Gee

and countless papers and thesis from around the country/world

Also, I have my notes from my playtime, Screenshots from the time in game ala Joe, and a ton of old threads in text form, as well as old livejournal entries and misc screenshots from other forums.

With all this in hand I am somewhat overwhelmed. I will be presenting this stuff and i'll be presenting after a case study of drug use in online gaming culture.

My basic idea is that there was a dominant group, the japanese. Time passed and they had no new content to compete for so they began to fade from dominant status. The North American, white dominated group came in and ascended to the old Japanese level followed by a large amount of new content to compete for. The dominant group was accustomed to the norms of the game + the norms of their culture. As time passed, some of the dominant group found that they were different from each other. Kuwaiti groups began a slow separation from the main group. This group, with it's large amount of resources and non-american norms were sort of driven into a corner by the dominant group and forced to be subordinate. The resulting reaction was aggressive and within a year, the Kuwaiti group had achieved the status that their former North American friends had had for years. 

The subordination and resulting feud generated thousands of forum posts not only Bismarck but in a variety of servers and other online habitations as well. 

The thing I am most worried about is that while I never actually said that I was there as a scientist, I often asked about why certain things were the way they were and the idea to write the paper came much later; at the end of my career in game. Ethical concerns and anonymity are always in question. While it is almost impossible to find out who the gamer is on the other side of the screen, it does give a point with which to begin tracking people down. An avatar name followed by a forum name will give an IP whereupon that can be traced and a real name attached. 

Those that are here will know who I am talking about when I refer to Tat or Blue Steal so I will be forced to remove the server name and rename each shell and person in order to deal with possible ethical issues. Also, the fact that while each group knew my interests, none have consented to be studied, further reenforcing a need to create anonymity. 

I have to wonder what sort of criticisms I'll receive. I also have to wonder if i'll be able to stand around for 20 min or 30 min and jabber about Fafnir and how much 1 zone in the game created so much animosity.

Sadly, I may have to create a glossary for this paper. 

Race
Bot
Kuwaiti
PC
NPC
Fafnir
Nidhogg
King Behemoth
NA
JP
Gil-Seller
Call for Help
MPK
Glitch
Kill-Steal
DOT

and more. Sigh. I sense more cards in my future."

"event","So, I played Portal this weekend. I have to say that I was sort of impressed by a game that seemed to be thrown together haphazardly but was intended to be sort of tongue in cheek awesome. Most of the puzzles I just sort of wandered through but Forrest and Mike got to yelling at me for finishing puzzles so I just ended up doing what they said. 

I like playing games that end up with me not really being more than a guy on a controller taking directions. It reminds me of Mario Party.

I also saw Mike perform and that was good. God knows all of my failed attempts to see Mike perform lately were, at best, enormously frustrating. Additionally, this weekend was the end of a friendship; well, at least it probably is. Me being friends with girls is proving to be too stressful and/or filled with useless emotions. Sometimes people don't really deserve an unfiltered me.

I also played Mario Galaxy; that game was pretty and super fun. I'm glad to see that Nintendo can still make an old franchise have tons and tons of new ways to be. I think the best quote was, ""So in this game Mario is a Spaceship?""

He sure is.

I'm wrapping up this semester and i'm going to be goddamn poor this week. Without Maggie there to feed me it's not going to be the most fun of things. I have enough food to eat but, do I have enough caffeine? I just don't know. I hate this inability to feed my addictions. I am going to be so busy this week that i'll probably break down midweek. I have to write a speech as well. 

The only directions of the speech are, ""Be Profound."" I have an awesome idea that starts with the line, ""Ten years ago this August, I stood in Bluffton, Ohio talking to the girl I was going to marry; the girl I had known my entire life. I looked at her, my ring on her finger, and I said, 'Brett, I know that there's more to the world than this and I have to go to college to understand why I know this.' I left Ohio, single, a year later.""

I want to talk about things like how hard college can be. The realigning of perceptions and goals and dreams; the idealization that slowly congeals into a disdain and mistrust of the institutions of Sociology. 

I think that'll be pretty profound.

Then, this break, I have to seriously work on a new paper for my racism in ffxi thing; and I have to work up some more stuff on the things the professors wanted me to do.

Ugh. Without money this won't be fun! But, I'll actually have more money than I thought. i'm super super glad.

With that, I must go now.

"event","So, 

So, 

So,

I've had a pretty awesome week all around. Work, Life, Games, everything is going really well! I worry about the inevitable road block but it isn't going to come from me this time. I'm going to need to get a part time job I think, to fill the gaps between the end of the semester and New Years. I could probably work a hell of a lot somewhere. I guess i'll see about temp work or something. 

So, let's talk about Final Fantasy 11. So, when I quit the game I sold my equips, money, character, and game discs. I didn't want to go back because I was using it as a crutch to get through an awful time in my life. Such is the way of the virtual world I suppose; what if it does represent a more entertaining alternative than real life?

Ok, so, being that I always felt bad for abandoning Damon, Forrest, Nile and even Joe, I took an offer from Forrest to go back to playing FFXI with a friend of their's character. He was TaruTaru, and the same model as me, just different color hair. 

It's strange being another person's character but it's been awesome now that I moved to a server with Forrest and Nile where my old character isn't known. The other thing that is strange is that my experience and knowledge of the game is far greater than my character's stats and abilities or equipment. I'll have to do a lot of quests and things over again to get myself back to where I was.

Being that it had almost been 3 or 4 years since I had played the job Objection had leveled, I was exceedingly worried about not being good at the job. I knew how it would work but I was worried my attention to detail had diminished and my skill had decreased. 

But, I had a plan! I would begin by camping a lot of mobs on my own, then I would install an expansion and start working my way up to the spot where all of the people at the highest level did things. So, Wednesday was the day that all of that happened. I installed and went about refamiliarizing myself with an almost completely unfamiliar part of the game. I have to say that it's exciting getting back into the game now that there is so much more of the game to play. I had grown bored with the other aspects of it.

It's strange; very strange, to have to reacclimate myself to a world I was so familiar with. Stranger still, and the reason for this entry, is the extreme differences I see between servers.

On Bismarck, 
I grew up with the rest of the North American players on a server that had been dominated by the Japanese. By the time we were in our upper 60's, the Japanese legends had sort of started disappearing. I remember one of the first high level clothcrafters in the game, Kid. I first saw this god amongst players as a level 30 guy. I remember checking him and he immediately change gear so I couldn't look at his gear. His bazaar comment always said, 'DO NOT CHECK ME, EVER'. 

But, such things do not last. After a time, all of us had surpassed our japanese competitors and we began to take over the camps. All new content we finished before them; all new monsters we went and killed. We took over everything for a good long time. And then, that too began to diminish. We had become those legendary characters. And we too, began to disappear.

On Asura
There are almost 0 Japanese players. i know they're there, i've made friends with some of them and i've made a point to remember what shells they're in and what they do. it's fun tracking people to see what time they devote to what. I think i've always enjoyed that part of the game; stalking through the search function.

On this server, it seems as though all of the old shells that came around the time IRON, ArchDominus, and the Lunarians did, also are disappearing. I remember LordWafik's shell, but that's about it. It seems like the legendary shells on Asura were either too ubiquitous to really notice or they were so mediocre as to never really be noticed. I have to say that of the shells i've seen, I would like to see them fight fafnir. I've been thinking of heading down there just to watch. I wonder how many times i'd get checked!?

The strangest thing about Asura is the acronym PST. I had never seen it before but it seems like Japanese and English use it alot. Please Send Tell (PST) is used instead of the Bismarck Traditional /tell (Name).

The other thing too is the amazing amount of completely english search comments. Instead of @2k (WORLD): O
(GEAR) (GEAR) (SUB) (SUB) it's 'I'm at 2k and I ususally sub this job. I don't have thse things. Invite!)

The server seems dominated by young players too impatient to create a successful and meaningful shell. And the shouts, dear god. Most of the players on Bismarck I knew would help each other out. Instead of standing and shouting for hours on end about wanting to do a quest, you'd go through Flists to see what people needed done and if they could help. I suppose that still exists to a degree on Asura but watching the chat log grow ever longer with shouts in the space of a few seconds is aggravating. I think it's almost time to shut off my ability to watch them.

The Game in General
Back when i was playing, certain jobs and the people that leveled those jobs were a joke. Dark Knight, Dragoons, and unless you were completely rolling in money, Samurai. Most shells would use 1 or 2 Samurai and Dark Knights to go after things. Armies of Summoners were the norm. but, then Square decided to beef up 2-handed weapons and these guys who were a joke with bad gear, bad attitudes, and little talent, suddenly have a means with which to be good and through no fault of their own. Just doing experience points in the new areas, i've seen so many Dragoons and Dark Knights who die getting to camp do insane damage just because they happen to have a 2-handed weapon.

It's a shame to see focused and amazing parties replaced with half-assed 'good because the makers decided to make something in the game amazing' parties. I used to be able to do xp parties on my own without needing any type of refresh. Haste and Regen were always enough. But now you have these DRK/DRG or DRG/SAM or some combination of the 3 that don't and won't sub sam that take so much damage i've been forced to expend some untold amount of healing before the second monster we fight even dies.

But, it's still fun. I like the Aht Uhrgan stuff i've seen. Ghost Pirates and Salvage seems to be really fun. I guess we'll sit back and see what happens with everything. 

Oh leon, you poor soul:

This song gets me through the day. Ok, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-c94VVU7zc"">this song</a> too. I'm ashamed I like Muse but this song is so good. This is probably the most obtuse entry i've ever made.

This time of my life is meant to be one of experimentation and revelation. But, going in, I had already been through all that junk. I've seen and done things that I wouldn't ever wish other people to experience. Living in this town, I feel so old that it's depressing at times. At times. 

But then I get past it and I soldier on to the goals i've set for myself. I've faltered several times on my way here. It's really hard because of the amount of alone i've made myself. It was somewhat stupid of me. I shied away from people for a long time. From what i've seen, i'm supposed to come out of this part of my life with a future wife and tons of friends. But in the long run i've got friends I don't get to see as often as I like and the women I have an interest in are so completely unreachable that at times I feel as though I may as well give up. Again, at times. But, I am far more than willing to fight for these things. Thanks to all this not killing me and making me stronger bullshit i've put up with, I can take far more emotional strife than anyone ever should.

<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/billieJean_clip.jpg"" align=left alt=A valentines from Michael to you>Speaking of, my ego took an incredible amount of damage this weekend. I can't think of a more destructive weekend that I didn't construct for myself. I usually do pretty good on the self destruction, you could almost say it's a hobby. So, what does one do to rebuild confidence? The only thing I can think of is what I always do, suck it up and dissolve the damage that was done through force of will. The ego is very malleable. As long as you have the will to tell it to do things, you can make it into whatever you want.

But i'm sitting here with this gargantuan feeling of despair and emotion I don't really know what to do with. I'm so unpracticed in these matters I don't always know what to do. Do I act on this? Do I buy 4 tubs of Ice Cream to bathe in? Do I buy a knife and go around town Shanking tires at will? What? What? I guess i'll just brush this off too and resolve to not let myself be so vulnerable. 

Vulnerability is something i've never been able to hide. I am easily destroyed. I am easily hurt. I've never tried to hide it. I think maybe that my confidence might mask this somewhat. I doubt people ever realize when i'm about to lose my temper or go through some magnitude of emotional outbreak. A woman once told me that i'm more girl than she is. But, that's not it at all. She loved misjudging me. Just because I know what my emotions are does not make me any weaker than a man who can only show confidence, anger, and happiness. I can be that guy too. I'm sorry if I find the way I was raised to stereotypical to follow.

In a sense, i've never tried to belong to any sort of stereotype. I like conversation and if I know what things feel like, if i experience things, then my conversation, ability to hold conversation, grows. 

I doubt anyone will give a damn about anything I wrote up here. I was asked why I write everything publicly pretty recently and I wasn't able to really give her an answer. I've been thinking about it and I pretty much just decided that I fall into the anonymous confession category. I like saying things about how and why I feel. If people see it and want to comment, cool. If not, that's cool too. There's something about hiding things that has always bugged me. If we all just knew each other a little better, what would that do? Too often you see people completely introverted because they feel some deep dark secret will betray some aspect of their past. Who cares! If people can't handle people doing things, regardless of content, they shouldn't be part of society anyway. We all make mistakes, what makes mine worse than yours?

So there you have it. I personal post about personal feelings about personal matters no one understands. <i>Excitement</i>."

My week has been sort of on the bizarre side. I guess the best way to put it is what I downloaded this week:

Garth Brooks - complete discography - oh yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeahs
Fiona Apple
Gravity Kills
Jet Set Radio
Dragonforce
and Mindless Self Indulgence

I feel all over the place. At times it's the best of times, others, worse than i've ever been. Now, I pretend to lead an uncomplicated life but, when reality shines on the LaLone vessel, my life is far more complex and insane than I could ever communicate. It's a weird happenstance; most accuse me of doing it on purpose. I just want a simple life; but I will take complicated steps to ensure the life I want. Anyway, maddness.

<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/not-feel-well-get-drunk.jpg"" align=left><b>Politics</b>
I have to write a research paper in Japanese this semester. I wasn't sure what I was going to do it on until i remembered hearing about Japan calling their military a military now, not a defense force. Japan, apparently, has the 4th largest military spending budget in the world. Their armies are technologically superior to a lot of armies in the world and with the lowering population of the homeland, I'd say Japan has a real reason to want to expand. Still, I don't think anyone really can stop them at this point. They've grown beyond the UN or the US requiring them to ask if they can deploy troops. I don't know if anyone even noticed when this was first done back in 2004 when Japan, illegally (according to the US written constitution (article 9), sent troops to Iraq to help America without permission from their own government or the UN. In compromise the troops weren't armed, but the symbolic standoff between the public of Japan and the government brought about the steps required for Japan to deploy their military where they like, when they like.

Needless to say, Korea and China are scared.

It's a strange time in the world. With all of the world powers routinely moving about their armies for whatever reason or another, made up or not, it seems a lot like the time just before World War 1. Is a world war always the answer to a build up of troops? Have we out grown our planet so much? It's a strange time to be alive. I can only hope I reach 35 before a draft happens...though, with the recent testing of the draft machinery maybe it'll come sooner than that. I don't know how i'd fare against whoever i'm shooting at. It's sort of disheartening to think about.

I feel like a hippy."

I feel like this sometimes. I've been trying to ride my bike more. I haven't drank soda in weeks. I haven't opened up or played anything but a case of Phoenix Wright in almost a month. What happened? Where did the time go? When did life become so hectic?

It's a strange thing when I find myself actually doing things. It doesn't happen to often but when it does it usually goes on for years. Regret, apprehension, and doubt continue to show up in my life. But, somewhere along the line I discovered I could tell them to go away. And they do! It's strange. I wonder when I picked my confidence up from Carla. She had it for a really long time.

I've been eating better, running pretty regularly, and losing weight. It's been a good couple months. My hair needs a trim, but I did what I never could before, and just let it grow and do what it wanted. All in all, the one place i've been slacking in lately is the school department. I'm so close to being done but i'm dragging. Senioritis was never something to slow me down before. But, I try to get my homework done, and too much tempts me away from it all. I say temptation when really it's my choice to begin with. But, with such possibility, who wouldn't?

So, here I sit, in the library at 530 on super bowl sunday wanting to do my Japanese homework and accomplishing little more than writing a ramble about my shamble of a life. Wait, is it a shamble? Actually, no it isn't. I used to think it was. I used to let someone do a lot of thinking for me; it didn't work out and now she won't talk to me without screaming.

She hates it when I think for myself.

At work, I was told today that I don't give off the impression that it's possible for me to have a one night stand. I don't know what to think about that. This combined with another thing someone told me, 'You feel feelings feelingly,' sort of hints that this might be true. I wonder if there is something I can do about that. I wonder if there is something I should do about that. I just don't know."

Big words, why do people use them? It's always bothered me. It doesn't bother in so much that people do use them, but that people insist to use them. It's sort of annoying that i've been forced to use them as i've gone through the boring world of academia. 

This break has been both annoying and completely awesome. I got to see someone I don't see very often, but all that brought was more stress than i'd ever care to have. I got to see old friends for New Year's, and I found out that something I had suspected all along was far more than true.  Life going into this semester is awesome, confusing, and partially beautifully frustrating, but time will tell what that will bring.

Tomorrow, Sunday, marks the beginning of the first week of school. I know I know, school doesn't <i>start</i> until Tuesday, but I have to change my sleeping habits and get into the mood for learning again. My schedule this semester is going to be rough. The schedule goes something like this:

ART HISTORY 2313   0252   200P- 315P -M-W--- CENT 00157   Patrick D

I've not been able to finish a five class semester for some time. I'm both extremely worried and anxious to see if, after finally beating back all my urges to destroy myself, I can reassume mantle of straight A's i'm used to. I'm getting tired of being mediocre. 

<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/live_and_let_die.jpg"" align=right>
So Tristram Shandy. I watched the mocumentary that came out recently. Right now i'm bidding on two old versions of this book. I'd like to try and read it in the old english but I doubt I could get through anything like it. Old english is rough. 

Speaking of books. I have a lot to read over the next few months. So much of it I should've read over this break but I found that Final Fantasy 12 was too much fun and too intriguing to take a break from. So, the list:

I guess i'm trying out some of the post modern stuff. Spin State and He, She and It are cyberpunk related. It's been a while since I made that journey. It's about time to do it again. 

I'm actually amassing furniture and possessions again; to the point where I'll actually need a truck to move. I haven't owned more than my clothes and a PS2 and a Television for some five or six years. It's been such a long time that I felt substantially alive that I couldn't really tell what it was when I first felt it. 

I think this post came mostly out of boredom than muse."

"event","<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/children_of_men.jpg"" align=left border=0> I went and saw <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/"">Children of Men</a> tonight. I wasn't really sure what to make of it when I was going in aside from thinking, 'What if Women couldn't get pregnant anymore?' We had had a discussion about the birth rates of the world going down. It's a pretty simple disaster that <i>could</i> happen without anyone ever realizing it. It's a fine balance that we keep. Although we've been going slowly upward for so long, there may come a time when the balance slips. Then what do we do? The population will shrink. If it shrinks just 1%, the economies of the world would probably go through a depression the likes of which no one had ever seen. Less people spending money but more work than could ever be done. Empty houses, empty schools. It's weird to think about logically.

This is an excerpt from an article from the <a href=""http://www.aag.org/Education/center/cgge-aag%20site/Population/lesson2_page2.html"">American Association of Geographers</a>:

<i>Many scientists believe that economic development is a major factor causing birth and death rates to fluctuate. They argue that with development, people gain better access to birth control; public health and sanitation improves; women become more independent; and food and basic necessities become more plentiful. These improvements, in turn, increase life expectancy and eventually prompt women to have fewer children.

What evidence is there to support the theory that economic development leads to a decline in death and birth rates? Some demographers point to the population histories of Western European countries as examples where populations that once grew rapidly experienced a graduate decline and stabilization of birth and death rates as a result of improved food supplies, public health, and technology. Historically, population changes in Western Europe corresponded to the following four stages, which are modeled on Figure 2:

      Stage 1: Both birth and death rates are high and population grows slowly, if at all (Europe between pre-history and about 1650).

      Stage 2: Birth rates remain high, but death rates fall sharply as a result of improved nutrition, medicine, health care, and sanitation. Population grows rapidly (Europe between 1650 and about World War I).

      Stage 3: Birth rates begin to drop rapidly, death rates continue to drop, but more slowly now. Economic and social gains, combined with lower infant mortality, reduce the desire for large families (Europe between 1920 and 1960s).

      Stage 4: Both birth and death rates are in balance, but at a much lower rate. Population growth is minimal if at all (Europe in the present).</i> 

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/Population_growth_rate_world.png"">
Population Growth Rate - Worldwide</center>

Economic Growth has been going up constantly and pretty consistently since what, 1987? Just what would happen if there were less people next generation than there are now? What if all those purple nations fell significantly under 0? The amount of people spending money or making money to tax would shrink. What would happen then?

Or maybe, probably, definitely, I don't know what i'm talking about and i'll need to read a couple books and do a paper on it to really understand. It's really the only way I learn anymore. Sometimes I think that the perpetual <i>why</i> that is in my head and drives me constantly looking for something deeper does little more than stop any sort of forward progress in thought capabilities.

So there, if a movie makes me think about that much retarded shit, it must be good! Right? Well, in any case, i'm very happy about the way this movie turned out. I was getting bored of sci-fi movies trying to be trendy with quirky characters in designer clothing and recycled ideas instead of critical ideas about societies future.

<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/35wr.jpg"" align=right>I started in on FF12. Everytime I start a game like this I wonder where the patience I had as a 11-18 year old went. Aside from FFXI, i've not been able to get through a new RPG since Final Fantasy 9, that was what, almost 7 years ago? But I keep trying. I think the longest game i've managed to get through that was made in the past 5 years is Metal Gear Solid 3 and that was only because it just might be the best game ever made.

FF12 does have Balthier though, ""The Leading Man."" I can't think of a man whose played this game and hasn't had a mancrush on the dashing skypirate. He keeps me going in much the same way that Bond keeps you going. The females in the game are nice. The idea of an everlasting bunny girl is perverse in the way only Japan can muster. Compared to the rest of the leading men in action movies i've seen lately, only Matthew McConaughey in Sahara really portrayed the hero in an awesome way. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Sahara wasn't that good of a movie. But, formula movies follow predictable patterns and that is always fun. Who doesn't like an Indiana Jones movie with a twist?

In any case, it's a bit overwhelming, Final Fantasy 12, but it's worth it. If you like grand adventures full of political intrigue, romance, and gigantic floating fortresses named after mythical creatures, FF12 is just for you."

I hope for everyone's sake the scanners do better, because if the scanner sees only darkly the way I do, then I'm cursed and cursed again.</i>

<b>A Scanner Darkly</b>
I bought this movie after not being able to rent it for almost a week. Going into it I knew two things, ok 3, I like Keaneu Reeves and I love Phillip K. Dick. I also knew that I had spent years dodging the movie <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/"">Waking Life</a> and that now would be a good time to go into the hippie infested pretentiously reflective Linklater dimension. 

From beginning to end, I was amazed. It wasn't just the way the movie was drawn, it was the atmosphere, the message, and the clever way they managed to get the Dick perception across. I've watched nearly every Phillip K. Dick adaptation that's been made. I'm obsessed with Dick. Hell, I own most every adaptation as well, but this movie captured the thing I love most about him. It doesn't matter if you've ever read a Dick story or not, this movie is worth watching if for nothing else than a small glimpse into a mind that understood where we were going, and didn't like it one bit. 

<b>New Year's Eve/Day.</b>
Last New Year's, <lj user=""kamui0101""> and I walked clear across town to go to the new castle of <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/deaconkole"">Brandon Zuern</a>, my oldest friend. It had been a long time since I had really hung out there; I was excited that I actually got to do something outside of El Rio. New Year's Eve last year was the beginning of a beneficial world of change for me. I would get rid of the FFXI malaise, the self destruction, and the job that fueled these things. I thought, as I walked down Lamar, that I would consciously try to better myself and to get rid of that thing that I knew was destroying me. 

This New Year's Eve was spent at the house of <lj user=""Themysterioush"">. I thought about just how far I've come. I made a few mistakes, still made a couple more later that night, but i've come a long way. But, just how far do I have to go? With the world's worst job I managed to get two B's and two C's; my highest semester since I came to Texas State. I know I could've gotten A's if I had tried harder; but i'm so tired. I just want it to end. Still, I spent a lot of time being distracted by worthless people at the beginning of the semester. I had to remember why I can't be friends with everyone. I had to remember what it's like to deal with emotional strife caused by being friends with people other friends don't like. I had to remember how to be a normal guy again. I sort of miss that time when I could just log on and go to Fafnir and that was the beginning of  my day. Who knew what I would do after that. But, one cannot live their real life in a fake world without losing the essentials. I didn't know what the essentials were when I left for that world, but I sure as hell do now.

<b>2007</b>
This is the year I graduate. I cannot tell you just how excited I am due to the fact that apprehension and fear cloud every single aspect of the end game of this life. What will happen? Will me with a degree be a better, more successful person than me without a degree? Before I get there, however, I need to make a decision. I spent most of my time at DataSource thinking that I could just get by then get an internship. However, my overly empathetic nature always makes things bad for me as I struggle to cope with the fact that i'm bothering people. It's a constant fight against feeling guilty for calling people. Because of this, i've settled into a not-so-great attitude at work. It gets me into trouble. Still, i try and struggle through. Can I do it for another few months? I just don't know.

So, my plans/resolutions for this year look something like this:
Graduate
Motorcycle/Car
Exercise more (help me, Megan)
Remember paitence
Focus
Get off the fast food addiction
GRE

It may seem like a small amount of things to do, but this year is going to change my life in ways I've been working for for years. I wonder what will happen."

"event","Lately i've been listening to Guns N'Roses; a lot. I think I blame the fact that Sebastian Bach was talking up Axel's new album (like it'll really be released). I really want to see GNR come from out of nowhere and remind the world that Rock doesn't have to be dead. 

Lately i've also been working out. I forgot what it was like to feel sore from over activity. It's rough and I've yet to get a routine down, but I can totally tell that it's worth it. I touch myself; a lot. Ok, not really, but i'm happy to see I don't have to stay the portly fuck i've been for the past 5 years. 

I went to <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/"">The Departed</a> a few nights ago with the ever running late Maggie Omen (ahaha). I think i'm going to track down the movie it's based on, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/"">Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou)</a> just to see what people are bitching about. Really, this movie is pretty perfect. I like the way film noir has progressed these last few years. 

<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/"">The Departed</a> is gritty as fuck. After the characters are introduced, I don't think that there is a male without bruises or blood on them until well after the climax. I suppose the only counter to this is that women play a secondary role in this movie; though the main female lead is far more than important. Two scenes had me laughing hysterically. 

<blockquote>

<b>Ellerby (Alec Baldwin)</b>: Marriage is an important part of getting ahead. It lets people know you're not a homo. A married guy seems more stable. People see the ring, they think ""at least somebody can stand the son of a bitch."" Ladies see the ring, they know immediately that you must have some cash, and your cock must work.

<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: [After Costello showed him the dildo] Jesus fucking Christ, Frank! I almost fucking shot you.
<b>Frank Costello</b>: Calm down...don't shoot off in your pants. Besides, it was too hard to resist.
<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: That was a close call last night.
<b>Frank Costello</b>: Yea...you have to find this fuck in your department. I don't care what you have to do...just find him.
<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: I'm trying...did you get me the stuff I needed?
<b>Frank Costello</b>: [Handing him the ""Citizens"" envelope] Here you go.
<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: I'll run these through the database.
<b>Frank Costello</b>: Yea.
[Looking at the porn film playing on the screen]
<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: Why did you pick this place?
<b>Frank Costello</b>: Maybe it's cause I get cunt so easy that I never understood the point of jerking off in a movie theater.
<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: Then why the fuck did you pick it?
Frank Costello</b>: 'Cause I own it.
[Pauses]
<b>Frank Costello</b>: I don't need to remind you that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department, it won't be me who suffers for it.
<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: Would I be any good at what I do if I didn't already fucking know that?
<b>Frank Costello</b>: I need you to find this guy because I can't have that. I told you, I don't care what the fuck you have to do just find him.
<b>Colin Sullivan</b>: Hey...it involves lying and I'm pretty fucking good at that.
<b>Frank Costello</b>: I'll be in touch, alright.
[Gets up and leaves] 

<b>Ellerby</b>(Alec Baldwin): Go fuck yourself.
<b>Dignam</b>(Mark Wahlberg): I'm tired from fucking your wife.
<b>Ellerby</b>: How is your mother?
<b>Dignam</b>: Good, she's tired from fucking your father. </blockquote>

You sort of forget after a while that this movie is taking place in the 21st century. If the cell phones and computers weren't there, it'd essentially be an old time crime movie. It's good to see that not every movie that takes place now has to rely on some sort of crazy ass tech stuff (ok, ok, so the scene with the microprocessors at the docks - fuck off). 

I found out this week i'm 35 hours from graduation. 16 of that will be next semester, followed by 13 in the summer, and then an internship (6 hours) at DataSource. I'm sort of in limbo about the internship. On the one hand, I could graduate early and just take the fuck off. But on the other hand I could be responsible and get a foot in the door of a company that could employ me easily. It's rough. I could ALSO do 6 hour semesters for the next year and elongate my time at school while bringing up my grades. I don't think I need to say how fucking hard it is to get good grades when you work at a job for almost 40 hours a week and you can't study there. 2 hours of study for every hour of class = 30 hours of studying + 40 hours of work + 49 hours of sleep + 14 hours of workout = me really tired with no free time. 

I've been really enjoying the gameboy lately though. Thank god for games you can play for 20 minutes at a time. Also got my lappy back. Thank god for Dell Lawsuits!

Here's a video that is pretty enjoyable as far as activist stuff goes.

"event","So, ok, i'm going to whine. 

<b>Whine</b>
I went to work today; it was actually pretty nice. During my lunch break, I went to the pawn store nearby and bought the movie <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119822/"">As Good As It Gets</a>. Now, I don't really like Jack Nicholson. Say what you will about that statement, but this is about him in this movie. In this movie, he's about as real as a person can get. He's flawed, weird, creepy, fucked up, and every other adjective you can think of to describe a normal human male. But, every once in a while, you get this glimpse of what he can be. He can be a good person; he can be a gentleman. But what's the point? He's got money, success, and the big kicker is that he enjoys his work and he's good at it. But why should he be a gentleman to a world that could give a fuck less about him; a world that can only care for the work he does?

I think that this is where I am right now. I've been feeling this for a while. It's not that i'm a jerk (though I can be) and it's not that i'm weird, crazy, a megalomaniacal, ego tripping, cheauvanist piece of man meat looking for a hole to stick things in. All I want is to know that I can become a better person. But from where do I find the motivation? Where do I turn to see improvement? 

For years, I had thought that relying only on myself was the way to go. But this sort of thing leads to introverted tendencies and is somewhat contrary to what many believe is the human way; that we are social creatures. So, this, inevitably leads to relying on others for meaning that is, in it's own way, a central tenant of the Mead school of thought in sociology: Symbolic Interactionism. But in practice we are only connected to those we know. If we spend all our time putting up a front for those we know, can we truly improve ourselves? Or is the irony in all of this the simple fact that becoming a better person means simply fitting in with our friends better?

Yes, i'm leaving psychology and biology out of this. Those people that subscribe to those schools of thought far more deeply than I can tell me about social psychology and chemical imbalances; however, this isn't about that. What this IS about is a simple question:

<i>Is the only motivation to become a decent person simply the reward or ability to not be noticed unfavorably?</i>

I suppose that this finally turns toward philosophy. Objective morality and such, but I want to keep this on a societal level only. 

<b>games</b>
So i've sort of started a collection of gaming materials again. I've always enjoyed this hobby and I find that given the right impulses and demeanor I can pull it off without seeming too nerdy or too insane. I suppose that's a might shallow to say but lately i've been thinking a lot about fronts and masks so it's on my mind. Please forgive me. I decided to start in on the Sega Systems. I purchased:

<i>Dreamcast</i> - 3 controllers, Typing of the Dead, Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi, and Sega Bass Fishing - a small collection of games but it's a start. I need to get a few things to get up and running with this. Not like I have tons of time to play anyway. 

<i>Saturn</i> - Virtual On, Myst, Tomb Raider, and Daytona USA - Mainly bought this as I will be trying to find cheap copies of <i>THE GAMES</i>. It's like searching for fried gold. 

<i>NES</i> - with Mario 1, 2 and 3, Tetris, Ninja Gaiden, and A Boy and His Blob - This was a total impulse buy. All this for 40 buck. The games alone could get quite a bit more on the ebay. I wonder if I have the balls to beat ninja gaiden without a save state. 

<i>Advanced Wars DS</i> - finally bought this fucking thing. bought it with two novels i've been wanting as well. I loved and hated the first advanced wars; I see forrest playing this game so much I figure even if I play 1/4 what he does i'll have my monies worth. 

<i>Contact</i> - Well, ok, i'll purchase this soon. 

There are a lot of long term plans when it comes to collecting this crap. The goals i've set for myself are tiny; no games over 40.00 for any of the systems. The Saturn makes this especially hard as it will be difficult finding the one game I want: Bomberman, with multitaps and controllers. I feel sufficiently nerded. Here is a small list of games i'm looking at:

<i>Saturn</i>: NiGHTS into Dreams, Burning Rangers, Virtua Fighter Series, Die Hard Arcade, Guardian Heroes, Radiant Silvergun, and probably some random fighting games. 

<i>Dreamcast</i> (This list is uninspired): Shenmue, Space Channel 5, Power Stone 1+2, The Sonic Adventures, Chu Chu Rocket, Ikaruga, and a couple other random games.

<i>NES</i>: Who doesn't want games for this system? With the Wii coming, i'm hoping the market will die down for this system and I can purchase old games that cost lossa money for way cheap. Contra and Friday the 13th top this list. 

<b>Movies</b>
So, purchased a few movies too. <i>As Good as It Gets</i>, <i>Tombstone</i>, <i>28 Days Later</i>, and <i>Donnie Darko</i>. I don't know why I purchased the later. <i>Donnie Darko</i> is one of those movies I can only see once. I never really wanted to see it again. It's one of those movies that hits you at a specific moment and means something only for the moment you watched it in. If you see it again, that moment is lost. It's stupid, but my favorite Bill Murray movie <i>The Man Who Knew Too Little</i> was my first realization that some movies aren't meant to be seen again. 

<i>The Prestige</i>
This movie is written just like the magic trick and while it's predictable in some parts, it's The Prestige that will get you every fucking time. I swear to god I swore i knew what would happen no less than 3 times. I really hate being wrong but as long as it's worth it in the end, i'm happy. This movie is far more than clever; Chris Nolan did a damn fine job. I'll have to go see <i>The Illusionist</i> to see how a rival studio approached the matter. 

I would write more on it but I don't want to give anything away. It's seriously worth watching. Everything in that movie is an illusion; it's grand. 

And last but not least, for Joe Joe and his bizzare adventures. There is a damn fine article about <i>The Fountain</i> in this months issue of Wired Magazine. It isn't online yet, but i'll post a link when it goes. People should be subscribed to this mag anyway. What's wrong with all of you?!

"event","So I update <a href=""http://del.icio.us/namfoodles"">this page</a> pretty frequently. I add links that aren't things that most people will find on their own, god knows I never do, but are worthy of visiting for some reason or another (of course, it's a reason I pick; take that as you will).

The latest link I added is a <a href=""http://vnes.thatsanderskid.com/"">Java based NES emulator</a>. I don't know if this excites you or not, but to think that within the past 10 years we've gone from PC's that could barely run an NES emulator to having them online, for free, and they run perfectly, is quite a big feat (at least 20 character points worth). 

Today I started working out at the student center. I like it there. Today I also realized something a certain person has been trying to get me to see for a while, and that's nice too. I'm supposed to go running tomorrow morning but I want to do something tonight and i'm worried about that. I need to run, i've grown far too grounded. 

I've been skipping my Multicultural Relations class lately. To be honest, I haven't even bought the book for that class. I got a B on the first exam so i'm not too worried about it. It makes me angry, the waste that that class is versus the awesome it could be. 

You should also go <a href=""http://grauswein.net/sa/vgm/"">here</a> for the Orchestral Game Concert stuff. Not only does it sound like everyday classical music, you can guffaw in private at how people are trying to be cultured and proper listening to this. Like me. 

So what should I stick up here (i'm sort of sad youtube was purchased by google, hopefully that doesn't mean you can't stick random stupid crap on livejournals):

"event","I've been loving some Fantastic Plastic Machine lately. Especially the song I went out and found the video for. The video is ok, but the song is way better. I've been finding more and more that I absolutely love anything that sounds like surfer music, or maybe world of the future music / 50's utopian tunes? I don't know that there is really a difference. 

Today I started a conversation with myself in which Joe would sometimes inject ideas. I don't like when I do that but today since I woke up has been absolutely awful so, yeah, sorry Joe. The conversation was about a favorite topic of mine lately-nintendo.

This article, called <a href=""http://thewiikly.zogdog.com/article.php?article=34&ed=3&p=1"">Age of Disruption</a> is a not-so-critical review of Nintendo's ploy to state they are not competing with Sony and 360. What they are trying to do is disrupt or change the market that exists now and are attempting to replace it with their own model. From this perspective we can see sort of what they've <i>supposedly</i> been doing for the past few years.

I suppose that one side of this arguement could be that Nintendo has been messing with the market for years. With the revenue Pokemon and GBA sales generates, Nintendo has never needed to worry about money or poor Console sales. Because of this, they could simply send out the intentional viral form of what Nintendo felt should be the next few steps in the game market. Is it possible that they could've forseen that the endall of the current market model would be the PS3 and the 360? Did nintendo's research department really figure out that, starting with the N64 and moving through the Gamecube, they could insert the virus (wii) they designed into the market almost 10 years ago?

I mean, Nintendo has been trying to reach younger and older gamers alike with Games like Diddy Kong racing, the Mario Party series, the Mario franchise has always been geared toward audiences that aren't really there to play video games. Pokemon has kept kids interst for almost what, 15 years?

Some voice said that Nintendo is not as good a company as everyone makes them out to be. Everyone overestimates Nintendo. When you look at their track record, you could say that this is true. However, Nintendo does have one hell of a staff designing projects for their first party games. They've just always lacked in the 3rd party area. Gamecube had some fun games, it even had better ports than some PS2 games (Resident Evil 4, the resident evil series in general), and it's always been the source of party games (ok, they're a bit kiddy but they're sinister at the same time, like Japan). 

If Nintendo's plan has been the Wii all along, if N64, Gcube, the DS, SP, GBa were all parts of a much larger attempt to disrupt, destroy, the current video game marketing model (like people will buy Sony and Microsoft's new model anyway - 30 dollars for a car I can drive in game?!), then I think that it might be that people have underestimated Nintendo's ability to control the market they helped create in the first place.

I don't know if that made sense. Ah well.

Here is some entertaining lyrics from another Fantastic Plastic Machine song. This song has put me to sleep a few times. I swear French should be the language of good nite stories. 

Honolulu, Calcutta SONG LYRICS
by
Fantastic Plastic Machine
I can hear the inflight announcement 
It's time to take off 
J'entends le commandant, 
le decollage approache 
Let us board on a wonderful flight 
to the land of delight 
J'embarque pour cette terre 
de tous les reves 
Let's get away from here, 
escape from this dull reality 
Afin de fuer ce quotidien sie morne. 
I've been longing for this moment 
J'ai tant attendu que ce moment vienne.

The jet flies, carrying my hopes inside 
Ce jet vole, emportant tous mes espoirs 
The jet flies, leaving his despair behind 
Ce jet vole, laissant mon desespoir

I could sacrifice anything 
for wonderful future 
Pour un meilleur futur, 
je pourrais tout sacrifier 
So why do I continue to sigh, 
despite the clear blue sky 
C'est bizarre, le ciel est si bleu, 
et mon coeur, reste sombre. 
Althought I'm 20,000 meters high 
above the earth 
Mon corps est a 20,000 metres 
au-dessus de la terre, 
I know I've left my heart behind 
et mon ceour, lui yest reste'

The jet flies, carrying my hopes inside 
Ce jet vole, emportant tous mes espoirs 
The jet flies, leaving his despair behind 
Ce jet vole, laissant mon desespoir

Angst and Anticipation 
Angoisse et espoir 
Lingering and decision 
Regret et decision 
Past and future 
Passe et futur 
Honolulu, Calcutta 
Honolulu, Calcutta

Turn off the reading light 
and recline the seat 
J'eteins al lumiere et renverse le siege, 
Relax beneath the blanket 
from the smiling stewardess 
L'hotesse m'offre une couverture, 
Let's forget about the whole thing 
sleep tight until tomorrow 
Je devrais dormir et tout oublier 
'cause tomorrow a whole new life begins 
Demain, une nouvelle vie commencera.

The jet flies, carrying my hopes inside 
Ce jet vole, emportant tous mes espoirs 
The jet flies, leaving his despair behind 
Ce jet vole, laissant mon desespoir

Angst and Anticipation 
Angoisse et espoir 
Lingering and decision 
Regret et decision 
Past and future 
Passe et futur 
Honolulu, Calcutta 
Honolulu, Calcutta

When I opened my eyes, 
I found myself in the same old bed 
Je me reveille dans ce lit 
que je connais tant. 
My loved one was sound asleep, 
curled beside me wrapped up deep 
Il est-la, lui, a mes cote's, endormi. 
Was I only dreaming? 
Was it just illusion? 
N'estait-ce qu'un reve, qu'une illusion? 
No, it's not true. 
I don't believe this! 
Non, ce n'est pas vrai, je n'y crois pas"

Vin Diesel, yes, that Vin Diesel. I suppose most people wrote <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0419749/"">this movie</a> off. I bought it randomly, while walking through a video store that was going out of business. I will admit I am entertained by Vin Diesel a lot. I think it was around XxX and my ex, Carla, that all this began. I wouldn't call it a mancrush so much as amused respect. 

This will be a short review. I don't want to talk more about the movie than I should as I know what it's like to have movies spoiled for you (OH MY GOD HE WAS <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=p7_JafYlMY8"">DEAD THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME</a>). I know that Diesel can act. <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0181984/"">Boiler Room</a> was a pretty ok change from the action star I think maybe <i>everyone</i> expected him to become. For a while, I was ok with him just being the new action dude but I started reading some of his interviews, in particular <a href=""http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/riddick1.php"">this interview</a>, and thought that maybe he was just a guy who was trying to break into Hollywood by being some buff action guy all the while trying to find ways to do what he actually wanted; to act in normal movies. 

Like the IMDB page says, <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0419749/"">Find me Guilty</a> is based on a real-life event; Federal Agents seize not just part, but all of a crime family and put them all on trial. Diesel's character is already on jail for getting caught in a drug sting. After his lawyer gets him 30 years in jail for the drugs, he fires the lawyer and decides to represent himself in a court case that still calls itself the longest trial of all time (almost 2 years). 

Diesel's performance is something I don't think many people will be expecting considering half of the waking world who knows about him probably consider him to be some brain dead action star. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, make you think about the American Justice System, and maybe make you see an actor in a different way than Hollywood intended, <b>Find Me Guilty</b> is for you. 

Speaking of action heroes, action movies wouldn't be where they are now without Arnold. Walking around the HEB by my workplace, bored on break one night, I stumbled upon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2FQA/sr=8-5/qid=1156660312/ref=pd_bbs_5/104-9794940-3901562?ie=UTF8"">Arnold Schwarzenegger Celebrity Pack</a> which includes Predator, True Lies, and Commando. For 15 buck you get these three outstanding movies (say what you want about True Lies, it's awesome).

By the way, what's up with the doof in chainmail in Commando? I forgot about him. 

<b>Personal Stuff:</b>
So in celebration of beginning school, I bought myself a new distraction machine. I won't have much in the way of free time again but I bought a Gamecube along with Mario Baseball, Super Mario Sunshine, Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, Super Smash Brother's Melee, and the two StarFox Games (ok, so, dinosaurs and Starfox sucked but I was always miffed I didn't beat that game). 

In addition, I plan to purchase the Resident Evil series (from 0-4), Mario Strikers, Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mega Man Anniversary Collection, Mega Man Network Transmission, a couple Mario Party games, and Metroid 1,2. It's maybe a lofty goal to get all these games but it's something to work toward. My plan for the future sort of involves getting out of this room, into a normal apartment, and hosting game nights as they seem to be popular with the crowd at work (who doesn't like some oldschool action or good old fashion, easy to play, minigames). 

It's a lot to think about but it's easy enough to deal with, save money, save, save, save and then I can get out of this place and into a normal apartment. I'd love to go study abroad for the summer as well (though I think maybe, just maybe, i'll actually do the responsible thing and graduate).

"event","I decided to edit this entry as it didn't really convey the feeling I really wanted. I suppose, all things considered, I find myself regreting the things I should have done far more than other people my age. Where I am now is a combination of self-destruction in retribution for utter failure in circumstances I don't think anyone else could've really succeded. In retro-spect, the sum of my life has left me far stronger than i'd really like to admit. I don't want to admit it as I think weakness on one's sleeve is probably the most honest front a person could take. 

Maybe that is an odd perspective. I guess what I think or believe is that if you can't accept a person's weaknesses, then why even bother to look at that person's strengths. Strength means nothing if one's weakness is unknown; much like good is nothing without evil. A long time ago I found a teacher talking about Michael Jordan, at the height of his career, and how Jordan went and practiced everyday as he believed that there is always something we can improve. I strive to improve myself, maybe moreso than I should. As such, it becomes a weakness when not in check and this entry is testament to the times when I let a strength I know I have (humility) overtake me. It rarely lasts, however.

I think of this quote a lot:

<b><blockquote>Melvin Udall</b>: ""I've got a really great compliment for you, and its true.""

<b>Carol Connelly</b>: ""I'm so afraid you're about to say something awful.""

<b>Melvin Udall</b>: ""Don't be pessimistic, it's not your style. Anyway, heregoes: I've got this, what, ailment. Now, my doctor, this shrink I used to go to all the time, says that in fifty to sixty percent of cases, a pill really helps. I HATE pills, hate them. I'm using the word ""hate""about pills.

I find this quote somewhat fitting for my life; maybe fitting for most men in this world. Most men I know do everything in their lives to attract women. They work out, go to school to get a good job, buy the right clothes, well, you know the rest. Why is it that we, as men, can't do this stuff for ourselves? Is it selfish of me to want to go to school in order to improve my mind so I can better percieve the world around me? In this regard, I pretty much fail in the world of romance; you could say that my own selfish desires create this failure. 

I mess up with women quite a bit. As a guy who really doesn't care about finding romantic partners as much as he should, you could say i'm out of practice; if I ever was in practice to begin with is debateable...barely. I've forgotten how these things work. Still, there are those periods of time where I wish I could bring myself to try harder in this area; because I really don't. I sit around oblivious to that stuff, secretly hoping some random girl will come along and make me remember why I even like the idea of romance at all.

There have been maybe 3 or 4 girls (maybe 4.5 if you include the one from Louisianna) that i've even thought of in that way in the five years since my explosive breakup with the girl who pretty much ruined any hope I had for love being more than a fairy tale. I can't really say what it is that attracts me to them. I suppose one common interest all of them hold was that they didn't play the game of love; but I wish I could detect a pattern; some noticable and totally predictable pattern so that I could go looking for such girls-but it hasn't happened yet. 

So, there I am. There it is. I probably overthink these matters, as I do with most everything, but it is fun to think about and so much of our lives revolve around the idea that I think it's a bit warrented. 

All this stuff really hit me the day before school started. I sat there and wondered why I never really try to date. Is there something wrong with me? Then I thought of As good as it gets and realized that even if I wanted to date i'd need to be a better man. 

I'm smart, sometimes wise, and sometimes funny. I know my strengths pretty well. But, I know my weaknesses as well, and they drive me crazy. Self-destructive at times, bad with money, and that's just for starters. So, how can I be a better man? Well, I guess I just need to do it. Just like Nike. I just hope that i'm doing it for myself.

I wish it were that simple though. Ah well.

Well, depressed beginning of the school semester blah's aside, i'm really happy with how the summer turned out. I met a lot of new people; hung out at a lot of great places; and drank more than i've ever drank in my life. Hell, even my hair is changing and that hasn't happened since I was....8.

My semester is going to be a doozy. It'll be nice to have Tuesdays and Thursdays off of school for homework though as these classes are going to be extremely rough. Quantitative Analysis should be sort of fun though. I'll get to see another side of DataSource I don't think people really want to think about. 

Well, that's the muse's end (or not). I'm tired. I ran to Best Buy tonight to buy the movie listed here. Nerddom beware.

Speaking of nerddom, Nerd Core Hip Hop  is amusing me at the moment. Someone I was talking to thinks that it's too exclusionary and I agree i'd love to see nerds rap about stupid things like how much better Elric was than Dragonlance, but I guess people rapping about the Konami Code is a start. 

Going on from the Nerd thing, i'll post a few articles I found interesting in tech this week. Of course, google is in there again, but this article is a little crazy in the scope of things. Combining Television and Radio with the Internet so Google can target us all better is a really aggressive move on their part. <A href=""http://blogs.zdnet.com/micro-markets/?p=357"" target=_blank>See the article here.</A>

As the buzz around the internet is that the PS3 is going to flop and flop hard, I think Sony has decided to take advertising in a different way. <A href=""http://folding.stanford.edu/FAQ-PS3.html"" target=_blank>The PS3 will run Folding @ Home</A>, a web based molecular combination simulator. It's a nice gesture but i really don't think that it will sell systems so much as advertise them.

I'm not usually one to talk much about music as my reasons for liking music are little more than novelty. But, I do appreciate articles about how musicians are trying to adapt or integrate the internet into their lives. <A href=""http://wired.com/wired/archive/14.09/beck.html"" target=_blank>Beck's article with Wired</A> is pretty interesting and I hope that people can follow his lead.

<A href=""http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,71629-0.html?tw=wn_index_23"" target=_blank>Apple's image took a huge hit</A> this week as conditions of their factories and the way they churn out Ipod's got a lot of negative press this week. I own an Ipod, I also own Old Navy clothing, and eat at Taco Bell a lot so my apathy allows me to live guilt free, but underneath that i'm waiting paitently for the Zune and thinking about maybe trying out an alternative to the Ipod, it's just a shame i've wasted days of my life organizing my random music collection for Itunes.

He apparently had the files stored in his vault since the late 70's after not finishing a video for Pink Floyd.

I guess that's enough fun news I saw this week; it's time for me to find a picture, or a mildly entertaining movie about internet neutrality (and also, a ytmnd of <a href=""http://bucketoftruth.ytmnd.com/"">The Bucket of Truth</a>:

"event","Sunday nights have to be the worst time of the week. I sat there on my couch in the dark, listening to Sigur Ros alternate with Radiohead and Dragonforce on Itunes wondering if anyone who said they would call, actually would. I miss having a regular crew to do things with. I've never had a crew that would bar hop regularly, and this certainly is the town to do that in. So, there I sat, bored, feeling lonely. I text message a friend, they tell me they're in Kyle and won't be back tonight. I call another, they're at their parents until tomorrow. My only hope lies with a group that wanted to go see some romance movie...3 guys and a girl wanted to go (am I the only one that thinks that is weird?). 

So, the movie is supposed to start at 940, I get a call at 920 from Maggie, ""Nick! I'm like 5 from your house, you ready?!"" Maggie is always <i>just in time</i>. I find that quality funny but she always just gets there; dramatic entrance. We fly down Guadalupe (that's guadaloop for us texans...for some reason), merge onto 35 to run the five minutes to the theater and stop. For as far as I can see from Maggie's car, traffic. San Marcos is not a metropolis, nor is it even worthy of stopping by as a tourist, so this was pretty unexpected. 

For the next 45 minutes we sat there; thankfully the city had blocked off every exit ramp for the next five miles. We started talking. Maggie had all but decided to marry this guy both of us work with; apparently, after going out on the town, she was completely turned off by this guys behavior to her in public. So she sat there telling me all this depressing ""Why me, why me"" stuff and it really started to get to me. By the time we get to the movie theater, we're miserable beyond compare. 

The other two guys that went to the theater kept calling asking where we were. Eventually, we all settled on going to a later show of Taledaga Nights: The Legend of Ricky Bobby. We silently get our tickets, food, walk up the stairs to the theater, find a seat, and procede to be miserable. But this isn't a romance movie, it's Will Farrell. Within about 30 seconds our depression is forgotten, replaced with <i>shake and bake</i>.

<b>Taledega Nights: The Legend of Ricky Bobby</b> - a review
This is the first time I managed to get to the Tinsletown in San Marcos. I usually just wait until movies end up at the $.50 theater. I forgot that movie theaters sometimes have lots of people in them! Anyway, Taledega Nights is pretty worth seeing. This isn't so much a movie review as it is a few observations I made of the crowd while I was watching the movie. 

So, in this country you have something of a changing of the guard in terms of what the male gender is and can do. For ages, we were the conquerors, the leaders, the boss and it was fun. It was fun until the female gender realized that the W.A.S.P. male was pretty much an asshole and it was time to take their power and share it with everyone. You can say what you like about the state of equality now, but it's pretty obvious at least <i>something</i> is changing and this movie really captured that idea.

Ricky Bobby is your typical man. He drives a race car, thinks America is the best country ever, and that everyone else in the world wants nothing more than to come to america and live here. Small minded suburban upbringing, yee haw. So, Ricky Bobby is a winner, ""if you ain't in first, you're last"" is his big catch phrase. 

In comes the french. This guy is a formula racer and he's the god of racing. He's open minded, articulate, has an accent, and loves Jazz. The most entertaining thing i've ever seen happen with a group of people is the cringe followed by dead silence after the frenchman says that he's gay. I guess we're all not as open minded as we had hoped! 

So the movie goes on, Bobby sinks to dead last, realizes he was a fool, and comes back and wins again (this movie almost goes scene for scene with Days of Thunder, which is also awesome). By the end of the movie we all forgave the frenchman for being french, and gay. Well, or so I thought! Another cringe followed by dead silence, then laughter. 

Ok, i'm weird. Maybe I notice things I shouldn't. Maybe I enjoy movies for the wrong reason. But regardless, i've never laughed as hard at a movie since the first time I saw Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail. 

So the movie ends and we remember our misery. Her's for her unrequited love, mine for only being able to find girls with issues, or at the wrong time. It's an annoying trait. The rest of the night I spent talking to Maggie on MSN and making a facebook page. I don't know why I decided to make one, but as I like/love all things involving large groups of people on the net, I suppose it was inevitable. At least this way I can spy on who is going to be in my sociology classes and find ways to blackmail them. 

There hasn't been a lot of goings on in the world of the internet's search structure / internet neutrality. I guess the only thing of note was AOL's big blunder and the aftermath. <a href=""http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=4016"">Something Awful . com</a> has a pretty entertaining article about the search information. Out of it's initial context, some of the search logs are downright creepy!

<b>EDIT</b>: I take it back!. <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4789809.stm"">Microsoft</a> is actually trying something that doesn't really go along with their company image. Well, I take it back, I don't think it's open source so much a kit for development within the confines of what microsoft wants for xbox 360, but it is a step in an unlikely step for a company that took really aggressive steps to stop the hacking of the most hackable console ever, the Xbox. While the 360 has been able to be modded since before the system was fully released, it's nice to see Microsoft sort of accept that almost all innovation in the relm of technology is from the general public accidentally stumbling onto something the rest of the world can capitalize on.

I don't like normal Garfield but these still make me laugh.

"event","<i>While everyone seems to be focused on the Davinci Code aspect of this post, i'm more interested in the Google happenings after that idea. I've updated with a few more links!</i>

So, frustration at social situations has fueled this entry. I make all accusations and ideas under no serious nature. Enjoy my pain. 

So today I finished a book i've been trying to finish for some time, Lamb, by Christopher Moore. It's sort of funny I finished this book around the same time I watched the Davinci Code movie. So, we look again to Historical Accuracy and fiction. 

At the end of his book, Christopher Moore writes a single sentence to explain everything:

<i>The book you've just read is a story. I made it up.</i>

Lamb is about the best friend of Jesus, Levi who is called Biff. Throughout their journey's, Biff shows Jesus what the sins are, their consequences, and how to deal with them. In terms of a literary device, Biff is all the sin that Jesus didn't commit because Biff made it seem so bad Jesus couldn't fathom doing it.

And, it had the best names for prostitues/concubines ever:

<blockquote>Beautiful Gate of Heavenly Moisture Number Six
Silken Pillows of the Heavenly Softness of Clouds
Pea Pods in Duck Sauce with Crispy Noodle
Tiny Feet of the Divine Dance of Joyous Orgasm
Delicate Personage of Two Fu Dogs Wrestling Under a Blanket
Feminine Keeper of the Three Tunnels of Excessive Friendliness
Temptress of the Golden Light of the Harvest Moon</blockquote>

I suppose there are two things here that I feel need to be said. One is that Lamb is a book that pretty much approaches the same idea that The Davinci Code does. However, one is obviously fake, one is an attempt, I believe, to sell books by selling them as a sensational secret that has just been revealed. I believe that what people are angry about with regard to Davinci Code isn't so much that it's a reality and people think it's a reality; I think that people are mad because, much like the Blair Witch, or, maybe, The Osbornes, the simple fact that these things are staged or fake isn't addressed. People realize it's fake, some people anyway. Herein lies a problem.

Every type of rigorous exercise has experienced a degree of hoax, a certain degree of illusion (pit down man, The Blair Witch project, etc). Until now, there hasn't been a widely recognized as truth hoax as The Davinci Code in writing. Sure, there's been more than a few attempts, we've all heard about them. But nothing the public recognized as <i>dangerous</i>. What the Davinci Code does is allow a lie to be based on truth but warped to the authors needs without any sort of apology or disclaimer. In effect, it sort of defaces writing to a point where people can no longer trust what they read. 

But Nick, people already don't trust what they read. This is true, but the big difference here is that most people do accept what they look at in print, newspapers, non-fiction, wikipedia (ok, not really that, lol), and other authorities as true. The confusion Davinci Code brings is, is it fiction? Is it Non-fiction? Most people don't think much past that decision. Those people that recognize it as fiction seem to be in a minority. 

So now, this opens a door for anyone who has similar plans to sell books a leg to stand on. It's ok to sell this sort of baseless crap because it's sensational, because it's so false it seems true. While magazines like Weekly World News and the National Inquirer report fake news, fictional literature is supposed to remain fiction literature. Only now it's crossed that line in a big way. 

In a sense, The Davinci Code has obliterated hundreds of years of reader trust in what the author is supposed to be able to do. The sad thing is that this wouldn't matter if this book was simply about drugs or child abuse or anything like that. It only matters because it attacks the belief system that serves as the foundation for modern christianity. 

<b>Random Thought On religion</b>
It seems as though religion, specifically Christianity is changing these days. While a pious life of no possessions was good enough to keep the Amish Amish and the Quakers not sticking around for a while, our religion somehow spawned into this gigantic thing all of us now call Democracy (aka Capitalism). I offer no empirical evidence but if you want a good explanation go explore <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579583385/sr=1-2/qid=1155101714/ref=sr_1_2/104-9794940-3901562?ie=UTF8&s=books"">the Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism</a> and a nice book called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0205424031/sr=8-1/qid=1155101628/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-9794940-3901562?ie=UTF8"">Wayward Puritans</a>. Anyway, christianity is changing. To what, it remains something to be seen. Parlor tricks, Drive through confessionals, movie villains, we just don't know. 

Maybe Christianity will just go the way of the dinosaur and just become that thing we used to worship before the coming of the dollar.

<b>THE INTARWEB</b>
Several happenings on the net recently have been interesting. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/technology/07google.html?ex=1312603200&en=ea0b6d85dd95a703&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss"">The first comes from MTV and Google teaming up.</a>. While seemingly insignificant at first, this is an attempt by Google to try and really hurt what the suffering YouTube can put on it's site without penality. It's also an attempt to create an internet business model for streaming video content. I have to wonder how it's going to work. 

The next item is Google being sued by a <a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060803/0851258.shtml"">French equivalent AP service</a> over the content google news simply links to from their news headlines. In the long run, I agree with the author of that blurb. This move will hurt not only the French News that is suing Google, but may end up hurting other news websites as well. Google's news is all over their website, the BBC, the Guardian, the New York Times, Wired News, and a couple other Newspaper headlines all grace my custom front page. If anything, this is a step backward in solidifying news sources throughout the internet into a single voice. While a single voice may be easily corrupted, the different versions of a story can be quickly linked to a summarized one. In fact, most of the time, especially in the tech news area, I see almost identical news stories that get filtered down from wherever these things start. 

Still in other news, <a href=""http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,429525,00.html"">Google Earth</a> seems to be making a splash in the science world. People seemed to have noticed lately that maps of the entire world seem to be really useful! 

So, these three items seem to be insignificant but put together it's google doing what google seems to do best, work in the shadows to slowly bring the idea of the internet as google closer to fruition. It's getting to the point where nothing can be done without two companies, Microsoft and Google. 

<b>EDIT:</b> Google made news again today. This time it's about their attempts to <a href=""http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,71564-0.html?tw=rss.index"">digitize volumes and volumes of printed text found in the major college libraries</a> around the country. While I think this is a really good idea (mostly because I absolutely love Jstor and would love to see a free service like it), this does not come without consequence. I think this quote sums up a lot of peoples fears (though really, people will let google do it):
<blockquote><i>Google's motives aren't entirely altruistic. The Mountain View, California-based company wants to stock its search engine with unique material to give people more reasons to visit its website, the hub of an advertising network that generates most of its profits.</i></blockquote>
It's interesting that everything google does has people suing them. While this seems almost like a everyone versus the evil corporation legal battle, what it becomes is google bringing another field of knowledge into the digital age (which has, until all this stuff started, was sorely behind). The legal field has trained it's members in the same way for some 200 years; all the way down to what classes each student takes each semester. It teaches common law and precedent set by thousands, if not millions, of cases througout our history (yeah yeah, case method isn't new to anyone). But, without case history, a typical lawyer has no idea what to do when a firm digitizes thousands of tombs from a private institution. Who has legal right to say this can be done? Who should recieve royalties? Do people who wrote the work, if still alive, need to sign premission slips for the copyrighted work to be put into another format? Is this another format or a replacement for a paper format. It's interesting to see it happening. 

People have issues with Microsoft because Microsoft has released products to the public that intentionally erradicated fair competition. People accept google as god of the internet because google has yet to really make a mistake that people remember, despite basically erradication all their competition by infiltrating the entire internet with their advertising ideas. But, ask yourself a question, how does Google even make the $125billion+ that they are supposedly worth. From where does all this money come from? Do I pay for <i>anything</i> google offers?

It's a business model that really works. 

<b>EDIT:</b>  In other news we see <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html?ex=1312776000&en=996f61c946da4d34&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss"">This gem from AOL</a>. It's fun to see internet research ethics making it into the New York Times. As my chosen passion, it makes me smile to see the so-called niche work of sociology find it's way into the public eye. 

So yeah, there you have a few half arguements and a few half baked ideas. I've not had any alcohol tonight but I am a little drunk on an idea that was planted in my head a few days ago. As a picture, because I always have to have a picture, I give you (thanks forrest) <i>this</i>:

"event","Ok, I like the Davinci Code. You happy? You want to yell at me? Scream at me? Make fun of me? Go ahead. It's not like, <i>oh my freaking dear god i've revolutionized the way I worship god</i> huge but, as a movie and a book, it sort of does something that I think is a bit devious; or maybe a little destructive. 

Historical Fiction is always something that has interested me. I really like <i>The Far Side of the World</i> series for the warning it always provides:

<i>I have taken great liberties; I have seized upon documents, poems, letters, and within a context of historical accuracy I have changed names, places, and minor events to suit my tale.</i>

Now, one of the things brought up against The Davinci Code is that an author has a responsibility to his/her audience to maintain where facts come from if they are used and, in cases like historical fiction, show where the ideas come from and what was changed. However, this assumes 2 things. 

1). The general population that reads books is gullible.
2). This same gullible population will tell their friends and then you've got a real problem.

So, who's fault is it that the people are stupid and writers have some sort of desperate need to keep them informed by not writing crazy fiction that rearranges history? And, where do you draw the line? It's ok to have Queen Elizabeth as long as she's queen Elizabeth but what if she's exchanged with Queen Victoria as though it were always that way? What if Shakespear was moved back a bit to write the tale of Beowulf. 

What about books like House of Leaves that create an entire fictional piece of film but give it so much detail it has to exist. Just where do we draw the line, is fiction written as a slanted non-fiction too powerful to deal with? Are the people really that stupid?

"event","This is going to be a super long post. I can tell just by looking at what I want to write. Ah well, let's get started. (Supervillain Motivational Posters, GOOOOO!)
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/robin_hood_otivation.jpg""></center>
Ok, so, I guess i'm standing on the brink of two possibilities. One is super self-destructive. The other is root setting and long range minded. These two possibilities do not sit in my decision, but the decision of another. And, that decision is made tomorrow (today in 3 minutes). It's a scary time. 

So anyway, i've been on edge all day. Retarded teens making work annoying, bills piling up, my want to start anew and get a new apartment, my want for a girl but only finding crazies (though maybe, just maybe, that might not be true - we shall see); all of these things writhe within me, desperately wanting to be more than just unrequited and impossible desire. 

Like I said, <i>on edge</i>. My want today, for the time after work where I unwind, was to write a short story about a teenage love with a supernatural twist. I like such stories and this one is something I think any guy could say they've wondered the same thing. It'll be embarassing to write but it's something i've always wanted to try. I don't know if i'd be strong enough to post it; I lack in that confidence factor. 

But, want or not, what I got was a random trip to the movie theater to see Xmen 3. Like it or not, my inner geek always manages to find expression through impulse. I went in here knowing that the Juggernaut said his favorite line and that Jean became Dark Pheonix, but that was about it. Ok, so what do I think? 

<b>If you don't want spoilers, don't read</b>
<hr>
<b>X-Men 3</b>
If I were to rate every movie i've ever seen, Xmen 3 would probably be very very close to the bottom. I've seen some awful films. Hell, most people who know me would say that my taste in movies is questionable at best. But, in this, most people will agree. So, problems with the movie?

<b>Issues</b>
Jean Grey died at the end of the last movie. It's no suprise for fans that she's back in this movie. But, as the focal point of the movie, why doesn't she do something? In every scene she's either standing there looking menacing, standing there looking confused, or standing there looking sad. Total ultimate power does not mean being a rock that disentegrates stuff in a hundred foot radius sometimes. 

Xavier dying. Ok, Charles Xavier is <i>THE</i> Xmen. Without him they're what? Cyclops and crew? Oh wait, Cyclops died too. Ok, so, the Xmen are now Wolverine and Storm and Beast and 5 or 6 teens going through boyfriend or girlfriend issues? Whee, that's a great movie.

Magneto was pretty ok in this movie right up until he ripped the Golden Gate Bridge off of its foundation and moved it to Alcatraz. Then he became what? A normal person? 

Ok, so by the end of the movie Cyclops is dead, Magneto is human, Xavier is disentigreated, Rogue is human, Mystique is human, all of the Morlock's and most of the mutants are dead after becoming human or being disitegrataed at Jean Grey's hands. Oh yeah, Jean Grey died, Wolverine killed her...for some reason.

Honestly, I wanted to like this movie. I liked the changes to Jean Grey. I liked that her mutant powers were kept in check by Xavier and that it always was trying to get out without Jean really knowing about it. I always liked the dirty things Xavier did to the Xmen without them really knowing about it. Further, I liked the line from the Xmen where Xavier sat using cerebro and maintained the body chemistry of each Xmen while they were fighting. I like a not sure pure Charles Xavier. 

Other than that, this movie failed in all ways. 

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/powernaps.jpg""></center>
<hr>
I sort of bought this movie on a whim. It was a 3/25 deal so I bought War of the Worlds, Chronicles of Narnia, and The History of Violence. Good purchases? Maybe? I doubt it. 

<b>The Chronicles of Narnia (Is Asland Jesus? Is Jesus Asland? Is Jesus God? Is Asland God?) ARE POLAR BEAR'S EVIL!??! OH SNAP, RHINO!1</b>

I like this movie. As I've shunned my own family, movies that have to do about love or families sticking together really make me all warm and fuzzy inside. Mostly because i'll probably never ever feel that feeling again. (cry). 

So, the Queen of Narnia is hot. I don't know if it's her crazy dreds or cold demeanor but damn, she's hot. This movie is pretty unbelievable in that it's probably unlikely that a couple of teenagers can learn how to weild long swords overnight, or that really, they could deal with the amazing amount of bloodshed and suffering in that short of a time span without going catatonic. But hey, their pet lion is helping them out. We all probably know this story. If you don't, you should go get it! It's worth it!

<b>Issues</b>
Asland is a character that has always frustated me. I suppose in as much that christianity has always frustrated me. I want there to be some sort of all-knowing Lion up there, watching over all of us, but in the end, without seeing him, can we know he's there? A timeless debate goes on. 

Why does Asland kill the Queen of Narnia? Why didn't he just do that to begin with? Why go through the crap of killing himself (sacrificing) to just kill her later? Maybe I don't understand God.

I guess the other issue I had was the same issue I had with all movies involving heavy doses of child acting. I can't help but feel sorry for them. So much of their life is determined just by having appeared in a movie at that age. Drug use, abuse, depression, it can't be easy on them yet they continue to do it in droves. Why? It just doesn't seem worth it. I guess it always bothered me, so, movies with lots of kids as main characters bothers me.
<hr>
So, there is a couple movie reviews. I guess i'm not a good person with regard to the spoilers but, these movies are nothing suprising. It's 130 am and I really want to go to bed so I can get a haircut before I go to work tomorrow. I don't know if it's worth it. I guess I let my hair go for quite a while so it's become time for such things but i'm a little worried.

I don't worry about my looks much. If I don't attract because of myself then I guess you could say i'm not interested. To me, love was always something that arose from friendship. It is this belief that keeps me from chasing girls that are willing to let me have them so easily. One-night stands seem like a fun idea but I worry for the consequences thanks to Carla; and partially, Ali. The later of the two I don't understand. What she did doesn't really make sense to me.

If she showed up tomorrow, at my door, i'd be unable to turn her away. It took so much for me to turn her away and that was just a momentary surge of adrenaline brought about by the power of the internet. 

I'm such a coward sometimes.

So it continues. No headache today, thank god, but my restless soul has decided it's midnight and it's time for the wakies. Today when I woke up I started thinking about art; also, what is art? Specifically, digital art.

To me, art is what happens when a new idea appears through a medium like television or whatever, and the mainstream, or public, likes it so much that other artists can abuse it to an insane degree. In other words, some thing that perfectly defines a general subject that is then copied ad nauseum until the next big thing comes along (stupid drip paint on canvas Pollock, J.R.R Tolkein). You can usually see what's going to happen if you look around at the stuff that's happening just off the mainsteam area. It's usually a different take on an old thing, or maybe, just maybe, it's something new. I'm not saying that all the stuff that happens between periods isn't art; i'm just saying that to me, real art is the stuff that defines a new direction, a new idea, of what that medium is or can do. Everything in between are simply steps to the next big idea; necessary but not really breathtaking or inpiring in their own way, just a feeling of, 'ok, we're getting there.'

This is not to say that art is some all encompassing thing, one genre, variety of media; but that each media is, in a sense, defined by the current idea of what that media is used for. Any media could be used for any sort of genre, that's fine, but the way it is used never changes. TV and movies are for showing moving pictures; ideas through visalization, books are for expressing ideas with words; sometimes with the aid of pictures, and pictures are used for a variety of reasons, Sculpture, well, I don't know enough about sculpture to really say anything more than it seems as though they are 3d representations of pictures, copies of our reality, or representations of abstract thought.

So, is the digital a media, or a new way for old things to be used? Well, to me, the digital is a way to combine everything into one media. Words, pictures, moving pictures, sculpture, music, everything. It's sort of new. No one seems to understand or comprehend the full potential of this idea. I sit here, at night, in this studio apartment trying to understand the visuals I have in my head. What do they mean? What is it i'm seeing? I can't put it to words. It's just a feeling that something is about to happen. Some new change; and I don't know if it's good or bad, is about to start. All I know is that it'll start on the net, where the digital matters most. The funny part is that this isn't just about art, art will happen regardless of what happens now, but the way art is distributed and percieved is up for grabs. What happens to the net in the next 5 years will be the most important factor. 

Or maybe i'm just interpreting it all wrong and i'm just making all this up! Or maybe it's wishful thinking. 

In any case, this has been on my mind for the past few weeks. Stuff i've read, stuff i've seen, stuff i've heard, all of it's connected in some bizzare way. Google, yahoo, WYSIWYG 2.0, microsoft, apple, nintendo, bluetooth, internet neutrality, etc etc; everything that is happening now is affecting some other thing that was about to happen. Now those things are being interpreted in a different way then they were originally meant to be. It's weird.

I could go on and on and on, but i'll stop there and list some stuff:

Today I wake up after a shitty sleep and look at the clock; 3am. Well, it's going to be a long long day. I've been trying to change my diet lately. Less caffiene from soda, less fast food. For the past three days, my fast food intake has been 0. It's strange, you wouldn't think that giving something up as <i>horrible for you</i> as Jack in the Box and Taco Bell could really be that hard to give up. But, after the second day in a row with cold sweats and migraines, I can completely understand what it is that it's been doing to me. The big question now is, do i stay on it or do I try and get through the misery. I'm praying to god I get a call today to tell me that I don't have to come to work because the servers are still down. 

Anyway, I started reading a thread on in-game griefing; online and offline things people do in video games. I couldn't help but think of the crazy things i'd do when no one was online in FFXI and I was awake for some reason. CFH on NM's like Amemet and the Loxley Bow NM, train Crawler's Nest, Boyada Tree, claim NM's and run off with them, steal NM's, and god only knows what else. Most of my griefing was done when no one was around and I really wanted to let out some frustration. I don't even know why I never got caught. I know people saw me doing some of the things I did. Weird.

So, aside from that game i'm pretty straight and narrow when it comes to video games. I very rarely go out of my way to be a jerk. But, truth be told, the type of games I play don't usually allow for such things to even be remotely possible (single player strategy games). I thought i'd post some videos (some of them are awesome):

<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7118750192530790377&q=counter%20strike%20vents"">Counter Strike</a>

<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-982380251124231965&q=world+of+warcraft"">World of Warcraft</a>

<a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=gbU_YqGZF5Y&search=oblivion%20fanboy"">Oblivion</a>

<a href=""http://cs-bitchcantlivewithoutshield.ytmnsfw.com/"">Counter-Strike again!</a>

<a href=""http://wowseriousbusiness.ytmnsfw.com/"">This is supposed to be Dark Age of Camelot but it doesn't matter</a>

What is it with online games that brings out such behavior in people? I did things in game I would never have done in real life. The people I played with all did similar things. Is it us? Is it the game? Is it the medium? Centuries from now, I doubt we'll even be close to figuring it out."

"event","That man some of you know as Luminaire, others knows as Uroboros, and still others know as Doctor Deelite, showed me a few movies that are coming to theaters soon. He was disappointed that I didn't seem quite so excited as I should be. It's true, I look at upcoming movies as another chance for me to be disappointed. The length of time that has passed since i've been amazed by a movie is years; since, really, Requiem for a Dream. 

It seems a strange time for movies; holywood seems to have decided that <i>the formula</i> just isn't good enough for people to keep wanting to watch. The glut of awful movies and rehashed deas has been something that has come to define not just video games, but movies as well. What new ideas can people come up with using the same old ideas? Want another superhero movie from a comic? Want another fantasy epic? Maybe my standards are too high. 

Anyway, these movies Luminaire showed me do seem pretty goddamn good. I am reserving my final judgement but for now, they make me happy to think about (like the <a href=""http://wii.nintendo.com/home.html"">Wii</a>).

Really this movie seems like a drug induced idea that people decided to make under the same influence. It reminds me of an RPG I tried to make with the old RPG Maker where water was slowly getting heavier and people were slowly dying. It seems like such a crazy idea it has to be an ok movie! Maybe better than ok?

Besides being made by the <i>Pi/Requiem for a Dream</i> guy, this movie seems to reference one of my favorite age of discovery legends, the fountain of youth. I will admit that I have secret crushes on both stars of this movie (Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman (mancrush, lol)); I guess they aren't secrets anymore. The interesting part of this movie is the future. What is up with the future?

Apparently Mel Gibson has been off doing some sort of crazy ass drugs. I've tried looking around for reviews or teasers about this movie and I haven't been able to find anything more than the trailer (or maybe, I just really didn't want to know until I saw it). The dancing girl they show for a split second, with the bone through her septum, is sexy in a weird sort of way. I'm sort of excited and also sort of dread this movie as (because I was anthropology major for a while) aztec and mayan civilization is somewhat of an overworked subject in my life. But, this movie seems to be non-traditional in such a way as only a former star who has nothing to lose but money sort of way that it excites me to think about. 

<center><a href=""theillusionist.com""><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/illusionist.jpg""><br>The Illusionist</center></a>
Besides being my favorite class in Dungeons and Dragons, i've always loved two things, Ed Norton and movies about magic and magicians. This movie seems pretty awesome (Jessica Biel????). I like, judging from the trailer, how Norton's character seems more and more sinister throughout the trailer (vis-a-vis, the movie). 

<center><a href=""http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/theprestige/""><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/prestige.jpg""><br>The Prestige</center></a>
Ok, two movies of similar themes at the same time stinks of studio fighting (13th floor/Dark City is the only other pairing I could think of as an example). However, this one pairs up Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale (I think this just about covers my secret mancrushes). The trailer I linked sort of hints that Bale just might be something more than a simple magician. Supernatural themes and magic have been approached before by Scott Bakula (Lord of Illusions), but not without a horror motif. I think, in this instance, character driven drama like <i>Needful Things</i> versus horror from beyond seeking to obliterate everything might prove to be a bit better. Maybe that doesn't make since, but it does in my head.

So there you have it. Excitement, Apprehension, and Joy all contained in 5 movies. Truth be told, I can do absolutely nothing in terms of trying to improve movies and/or video games on my own and this sort of makes my points somewhat moot in the long run of things. But, everyone's a critic so I suppose it can't be helped.

<hr>
<b>Books</b> - I've been putting off working on things because of my sudden discovery of fun. But, i've found a few quotes i'd like to use so i'm going to put them in here as my books are a month overdue and it's high time I write it all down. 

Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. <i>Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States</i>. Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, inc. Lanham, Maryland. 2003.

This is a book i'm definitely going to buy when I get a chance. Aside from the really entertaining voice this guy uses (think very angry, very smart person), to the message it brings, this book is definitely an eye opener if you can get past his tone. For instance:

(page 1)<i>But Regardless of whites' ""sincere fictions,"" racial considerations shade almost everything in America. Blacks and dark-skinned racial minorities lag well behind whites in virtually every area of social life; they are about three times more likely to be poor than whites, earn about 40% less than whites, and have about a tenth of the net worth that whites have. They also recieve an inferior education compared to whites, even when they attend integrated institutions. In terms of housing, black-owned units comparable to white-owned ones are valued at 35% less. Blacks and Latinos also have less access to the entire housing market because whites, through a variety of exclusionary practices by white realtors and homeowners, have beensuccessful in effectively limiting their entrance into many neighborhoods. Blacks recieve impolite treatment in stores, in returants, and in a host of other commerical transations. Researchers have also documented that blacks pa more for goods such as cars and houses than do whites. Finally, blacks and dark-skinned Latinos are the targets of racial profiling by the police that, combined with the highly racialized criminal court system, guarantees their overpresentation of those arrested, prosecuted, incarcerated, and if charged for a capital crime, executed. Racial profiling in the highways has become such a prevalent phenomenon that a term has emerged to describe it: driving while black. In short, blacks and most minorities are, ""At the bottom of the well.""</i>

The most important factor in this book is his central idea:

<i>...new racial ideology that I label color-blind racism. This ideology, which acquired cohesiveness and dominance in the late 1960s, explains contemporary racial inequality as the outcome of nonracial dynamics...whites rationalize minorities' contemporary status as the product of market dynamics, naturally occuring phenomena, and blacks' imputed cultural limitations.</i>

I really like what this book has to say as it sort of gives voice to a lot of the things i've always wondered about as I grew up in a completely white town. He shows evidence of how little things have changed since the Equal Rights Act. This book and a few essays in a different book I own really talk about the ERA as the time when whites took a step back to let the minorities become more like white people. It's a really subdued concept that I don't think white people every really look at. God knows any time I bring it up i'm chastised to the point of absurdity (reducto ad absurdum). 

This next book I got after looking through some Amazon listmania crap. It seemed interesting enough but it's very very hard to get through. I swear to god this sociology stuff translated from the high forms of the Latin based languages is some of the most needlessly complex stuff anyone could ever want to talk about. I've never understood why academia needs to write everything this way. 

Huizinga, J. <i>Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture. Beacon Press: Boston. 1950. </i>

I found this quote really interesting in terms of the idea of an MMORPG as a replacement for the game of real life. That we'd be willing to trade actual work in the real world for a fictional character that casts magic is a testament to a lot of social issues going around right now. This passage is what brought this thought on:

(page 13):<i> Summing up the formal characteristics of play we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside ""ordinary"" life as being ""not serious"", but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connecte with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds wthin its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings which tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from the common world by disguise or other means. </i>

I've been having this recurring dream where it's the beginning of a bond movie, and i'm James Bond. But, when the girl is rescued and it's time for sexual inuendo, crazy things start happening. All the former James Bonds come out but with their heads on elephants, running on huge watermelons, and 5 or 6 Oprah Winfrey's come flying into the screen like Mary Poppins. Today I was killing the Toxic Avenger, he was the bad guy in my new Bond movie apparently. Weird. I wouldn't think anything of it but I had a dream almost exactly like this just a couple days ago. However, in that movie the former bonds were burning bears; and the Oprahs were fire breathers.

I went to a party in Austin yesterday. It was pretty entertaining. In the long run, I think joining the Datasource team was probably my best move in a long long time. Considering when I first went there I had forgotten how to talk to anyone buy myself and considering I was probably at my most self-destructive when I first went to training, i've come a long way in re-joining the human race.

School is coming. I'm excited. I know it's going to be rough with my having to work work work work work but at least now I can get some peace and quiet when i'm at home versus having to deal with people setting towels on fire or destroying a clean bathroom with their disgusting bathing habits. Much of the old shyness, apprehension, with talking in front of larger groups has left me and a lot of the old storytelling techniques have returned. I know i'm going to have to give several presentations this semester, I wonder just how much i'll let myself do.

Much of what i'd like to do with Sociology revolves around how the internet is changing our way of life. Combined with a business or marketing focus, I'd like to join a production company to figure out a way to capitalize on cross medium productions with the addition of real time updates via cell phones or web casts. I've been trying to think of a good model to use but trying to use some medium just because they're new seems a little cheesy to me. Shows like 24, or the Lost, would do well to utilize such blossoming technology, but they seem content with how they are now, how things have always been. Only Halo 2, a video game from one of the richest companies in the world, has tried anything interesting with crossmedia promotions. www.ilovebees.com is still one of the most ingenius ways i've seen the net utilized.

"event","So I rented <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth</i> and also <i>The End of Evangelion</i> cause hey, <i>it's the most popular anime ever of all time and forever and ever to infinity and beyond!</i>; or some such crazy thing. 

So I rented it, and I watched it; I was doing laundry from my Austin trip. Now, when I first watched it I thought it was a lot like that other show <i>Lain</i>; all of us are connected in some crazy way but we forgot how to listen, blah blah blah. But in this show you've got these crazy mechs fighting some crazy <i>other</i>. These others were versions of us that didn't make the final cut and now, by killing them, we can get back to that existing as one thing. Ok, that's cool. 

So I rented these movies and <i>The End of Evangelion</i> is pretty much like this:

Boy: ""You broke up with me and I don't understand why!""
Girl: ""It's because you don't understand me""
Boy: ""But all you ever do is say something is wrong, never what is wrong.
Girl: ""It's because you don't understand, you can't understand.""
Boy: ""But all you ever do is talk in some crazy vague thing. You make everything worse than it is by being stupid.""
Girl: ""You're wrong, I know, you don't.""

And then he strangles the girl.

Then a bunch of mechs. They make out.

Then people start popping. And by popping I mean like popcorn or a puss filled wound. 

Then they start it over, the girl and the guy arguing, only this time he just says, 'oh, ok.' 

And the world is saved. But by saved I mean that humans all disappear and the world is pretty much destroyed. But hey, it's a good thing because we're all one again right? Right?

I want my 3 hours and 20 minutes back.

I saw this somewhere, some Livejournal userinfo thing, I think it's appropriate.

Austin this weekend. Should be fun! I think it's time to start doing something I always wanted to do but was too afraid to. 

It's time to read Book VII of The Dark Tower.

<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/TheDarkTower.jpg""></center>
It's been a long time coming. I think I read The Gunslinger way back in like 1993? I read The Drawing of Three sunburned into submission in Corolla, North Carolina in 1995. Later, I read The Wastelands in Bowling Green waiting for the fiance to come back from Amish land. When I moved to Annapolis, I read Wizard and Glass and also listened to it during my commute back and forth to Pharmaceuticals Research Plus and Blockbuster Video. 5 years later, I read Song of Sussanah and Wolves of the Callah in the form of an audio book while going to visit one Alison Griggs down in Louisianna. I've put off reading the last book because I don't really want it to end. I bought Hearts in Atlantis hoping that I could read that before the last book because I know it's a significant part of the last book but i'd really like to read the other books that play a major part in this story...but it's so much reading!

Off to Austin!"

<center><lj-cut text=""Soothing""></center>Man this is a crazy summer. I don't think i've drank so much liquor in my life. I can actually hold it somewhat now! whee. And the dancing, oh the dancing. I feel like a white fool, but ah well. Sometimes I miss a few people from FFXI but i'm glad that that time has passed. My mind has cleared up. All the fog and frailty from then seems to be, thankfully, gone. 

I've been helping an old friend write scripts for a <a href=""http://www.spycraftrpg.com/rpg/audiocredits.html"">radio drama</a>. I don't know when it happened but somewhere between then and now I gained the knowledge of how to maintain a characters voice throughout a script. Maybe it's just me tooting my horn but after going through my comments toward Les on the script i've been sort of happy with what I had to say and why. Les was too. 

Les, for those who know little about me other than i'm some sort of crazy person, rescued me from a great depression that began when the love of my life and I split and a friendship 20 years in the making was shattered. It was during this time I fled to the internet, eager to find some new form of communication to take all my hatred out on. 

Some of you know that guy, probably more know it than i'm willing to admit but, such are character flaws. Anyway, Les had the aim name of Neon Rooster. One day, looking through AIM names, looking for someone to talk to, I sent him a message about how cool such a name really is. Within a week, he had quickly become something of a mentor to me. I knew I wanted to escape, I knew I needed to escape, but I had no idea how. 

I wish I had kept all the chat logs of that time so I could look back at them and cringe. Cringe at the bile and outright stupidity I kept exhibiting. Les helped me get through all that. I think, looking back, he saw that I needed to get it all out but he also saw that I needed a guide. I wanted out of my hometown and no one in my life, at that time, knew exactly how to go, or why I should go about doing such a radical thing. 

Anyway, I was taking a few community college classes at that time. I was working for a company called Seneca Medical in Tiffin, Oh from 10p - 6a Sunday through Thursday. It was a fun job, I met a lot of interesting coke addicts and had my first exposure to drug culture. So, one day, I decided to skip my classes and went home and hopped on the PC, Les was online and we started talking about a few things. I wish I could remember how it started or how it ended but, in that one conversation, I changed forever. 

I think that Peter, The_never in my friends list on livejournal, is really the only person to know just how much I changed that day. It's unfortunate I tried to take on too much work at  the <a href=""http://www.gamingoutpost.com/articles/unregistered_author/78/daks_origins_2000_report/"">Gaming Outpost</a> and ended up burning out but that building block has always remained. It's taken me some 8 years to finally get stable enough to attempt school, on my own terms and for my own reasons. I've had a job in almost every industry I could think of and i've gone from pretty well off for a single guy to destitute. I like what the variety of perspectives has brought to me; though I will say that I despise the maddness that comes along with being destitute and alone. 

Looking back, I can see a myriad of mistakes I made: abortion, Carla, FFXI, and sadly, pushing Les away. I don't really understand why i decided to push Les away but I do know that I actively did so. I suppose I do such things, or did such things, when I found enough sex to keep me violently happy. That was a mistake. So, in the moment of clarity following the weeks after I sold off Namfoodle, I emailed Les an apology. Our lives had drifted apart, why not see what's been happening to each other lately. 

Like all good teachers, I felt like Les had been letting me go off and understand all the wisdom he imparted on me that day. I suppose, much to my dismay, I still have a lot to learn, but at least i feel like I can explore that stuff on my own, with my own methods. It's sort of funny that he and I ended up in a very similar perspective toward the current trends and attitudes of pop culture. It's led to a lot of really stimulating conversation as we've found the paths at which our perspectives do not agree. 

More than anything that's happened this summer, i'm glad I managed to work up the courage to talk to Les again. I suppose he's more of a father figure to me, or was, than my father ever was. But really, it was the teacher in him that allowed me to grow. </lj-cut>

I swear to god I will find the movie this book talks about. It has to exist...somewhere.

This is the first fictional work that has actively made me desire other drugs than alcohol. It's as if I need to get past my apprehension of recreational drug use to fully understand what it is those past generation X are trying to do.

I'll never write anything like those words ever again. It makes me sad I can't be old fashioned.

<b>Austin</b>
It's been a little under 6 months since I left Austin. Every day, I miss it more and more. San Marcos is fun in it's own way, but I miss the fun Austin had to offer when I was bored. Anyway.

Brandon said he was jonesin for gaming, Damon said he was coming to town, Mike said he was going to be playing on 6th Street, and I had a free weekend so I decided to head to the mighty A-town. What had initially been planned as a Friday through Monday trip became a Saturday through Monday trip because, as I regretfully discovered, I am <i>deathly allergic</i> to Fire Ants. So, after draining an ankle that was so swollen I couldn't move it, I hobbled to the Greyhound station, hopped on a bus, and slowly crept to the Highland Mall area of Austin.

It was nice to be able to hang out with old friends again. Everytime I hang out with Brandon and Damon, or any of the old crew, I get all nostalgic for the times of Hotel Lazuern and my job at chevron. So much has happened to me between now and then that I don't think anyone outside of the group would believe me. 

Most of the stuff in Austin this weekend was me seeing through eyes that could actually see. They weren't trying to see FFXI or clouded by boredom because I wasn't playing ffxi, I just got to enjoy myself and what I was doing. For the first time ever, I actually enjoyed a live show (more Glock!). I could sleep on a couch and go through the motions of the day without wondering if I would be able to get a drop from a mob when I got back to my room, my special living area. It's a weird perspective shift, if i do say so myself. 

I think the best part of this trip was seeing Brandon again. It's been a long time since the collapse of the hotel and all the drama that was associated with it. We got to get past that, reminisce about Tiffin, and enjoy some beer, video games, and board games. Of everyone i've ever known, he's always been the most steady. Brandon never changes. It's nice to see someone content with themselves, their existance. I always need change, even if it's bad. 

When I was leaving on the bus out of Austin, I was suprised at how much it hurt to actually leave. For being my former prison, it felt weird to miss it as the Frost Tower raced out of sight. But, I suppose it was El Rio that was my prison and not Austin. </lj-cut>
<center><img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b218/namfoodles/endoffoodle/profandnamfindfriend.jpg""></center>
<lj-cut text=""Life""><b>Life</b>
Life has been changing for me since I disconnected myself. I have a few regrets about how I chose to go out, but I still believe it had to happen the way it did. I should've just listened to Joe in the first place and cut off communication when I had the chance. Sometimes I wish I was stronger. But then, where would I get all this character from? How would I get stronger? (ok, ok, i'm stupid, let me live my dreams).

I've been slowly creeping my way back to the bookworm status I used to have. It's sort of hard to read translated books from High-French in a night, but I can still try. I have so much to read before I feel i'm ready to truly rewrite anything that I'm beginning to think that it's just an excuse not to rewrite it. My bus rides to and from Austin allowed me to get a lot of reading done and I think i've found a few decent quotes and paradigms to employ. I really hate framing my beliefs. 

In another perspective shift, I noticed how much I was begining to enjoy where I work. It used to be that when I went to work I counted down the time to when I had to leave. But now, I don't even look at the clock, I just do my work and when it's time to go, it's time to go. I've been spending a few nights at the library, a couple at the bar, and a couple at home. It's become a nice balance. I actually feel like I have a life. There is a girl sniffing around, but I haven't decided if i'm really ready for such a thing. Do I just need to swallow my pride and just deal with the fact that I fucked up and am fucked up from my last relationship (and last fake relationship) and just move on? Is it true old baggage can be put down?

I'm guessing it is.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Future""><b>Future</b>
Soon, I register for the last of 3 semesters of school. Two semesters of classes, One semester of internship. It's exciting and I am also extremely terrified of the world outside of school. So much, does my fear cripple me that I am starting to think of Grad Schools. The GRE worries me. Worries me. Worries me. Worries me.

What am I to do? As a person who could never score higher than 26 on the ACT, I know I don't test well. My puzzle solving techniques and my vocab skills are GOD AWFUL. My skills revolve around my perspective, observation, and disconnectedness. Not really testable skills. Further, what am I to do about a SOP or even letters of reccomendation? I suppose i'll have to work on that with the year I have left. 

Such things are the worries of Namfoodles. </lj-cut>"

"event","So, while reading Synthetic World's by Edward Castronova, I finally got to his 'deal'. His thesis or main idea for his book is something I think is rather revolutionary. It's one of these ideas that seems so obvious yet unexpressed. Anyway, the best way to describe it is the last paragraph of the second chapter:

<i><blockquote>Thus, syntetic worlds may find their significance, not in being radically different from the world of ordinary life, but in being so similar to it as to present a comparable option, one that in some cases may be the better of the two. Synthetic worlds are significant not just because of the unusual things that happen there, but also because of the likelihood that within the next few decades, many more million of people may eventually desire a life full of those unusual things, and may indeed prefer that kind of life to the life they lead now. Whether technology will be capable of fulfilling so may desires remains an open questions, however, ...</blockquote></i>

It's interesting just how many people are playing these games. While this chart does not contain most of the popular Asian based MMORPG's, you can get a pretty decent idea of who all is doing this sort of thing. (image from <a href=""http://www.mmogchart.com/"">http://www.mmogchart.com/</a>)

This past couple days, I decided to finally play through Metal Gear Solid 3 (not subsistence). This game is fantastic! I sort of wish that other people, when they make games, would follow Hideo Kojima's lead and <i>try something new (read: bat shit insane)</i>. It seems that every game, every franchise, every system, everything is just going with the flow, doing the same old thing, riding the train till some new thing comes along. What does it take to make a new trend in gaming? I'm so bored with games and gaming i'm actually passing up <b>Tremendous Deals</b>.

Well, i'm putting all my hope into the Wii, though, I did buy Shadow of the Colossus again so I suppose all hope isn't lost!"

"event","So the North Carolina crew had their last day today. I got to hear the phrase, 'you're so lucky' about 20 or 30 times before they all took off. I keep looking at the database I have to finish and I see the end of it coming in a few weeks. What am I to do? 

I suppose the most I can do is just not think of it until it finally hits me in the face. I can go work at some weird place for the rest of the summer...like I should've done in the first place! Next winter i'm definitely looking for a crazy place to work; like Alaska or some cruise ship. I think that'd be fun. 

Speaking of weird work, I signed up for work study this next semester. It should be fun. I wonder what i'll do?

I've started winding down my time in FFXI. I sold off almost everything and sold the gil so I can pay a few bills and i'm probably selling my account in the next few days as well. It feels weird. I made the decision to quit when the expansion came out...but I didn't know how I should quit. 

It's weird. After the burden of Aurora finally left me, all that bitterness and anger at ffxi finally left. I was happy. Playing the game was finally fun again. I think, after realizing just how much happier I was, I realized there was no better time to quit than right now. No attachments, no responsibility; and finally I could leave without feeling guilt. 

After selling all my stuff, I have to say...the feeling of turning that game off. The feeling of never logging on as Namfoodle ever again is one of the weirdest and most depressing things I have ever felt. For over 457 days, I have played as Namfoodle. I've been happy, sad, angry, and every other emotion a person is capable of. I've done terrible things, amazing things, beautiful and ugly things to people i'll never know and never meet. This game existed as my crutch for a time i'd like to not think of ever again.

So, Tuesday the 13th, when i shut the game off forever, I think i'll have a feeling of both relief and immense saddness.

So, about a week and a half ago in a drunken stupor I put my pants in the washer because they smelled of smoke. I woke up the next day and....THERE WAS MY CELL PHONE.

I'm very smart. 

I was sort of annoyed at this because ... who has money to just up and buy a new phone besides Ryan Harvey? However, at some point I made the wise decision to purchase equipment insurance! So, after about a week of sulking I called to make my claim. Today, my phone finally arrived and i'm not Amish anymore!

"event","...is probably my favorite episode from X-files without Mulder and a pretty entertaining quote in the context it was given in. For those of you who haven't had X-files obsessed friends or girlfriends, the context is, things we deem as insignigicant often have much larger impact on things that we can't see. Or something like that. Supposedly, it's a quote from the King of England on the day the colonies in America declared their independence.

<b>Work</b> 
I'm getting a little worried about my job. I know the work is running out but i'm not entirey sure if i have a job for the summer or not. I'll be out on the streets in no time if I dont at least get to work through June. I would feel awful having to scramble for a job only to leave it in a month to go back to DataSource. The stress of this is sort of weird. It's like injuring some part of your foot. It hurts forever and you're constantly worried about infection. I'm not really sure what to do here other than ride the wave for as long as I can.

<b>College</b>
Aside from doing very little writing or reading this summer, i've been trying to scramble to get enough money to pay for a class this semester. However, due to the financial situation, this probably isn't going to happen. I really want to do this so it sort of stings looking at something i'd really like, and need, and not being able to afford it. 

<b>Research</b>
For this rewrite I sat down almost for an entire day to try and think of a good sentence to summarize and foreshadow what it is I was trying to say in that last paper. In the end, I think I came up with an ok sentence. I'm sort of looking forward to going to the library to try and find some books to help me. 

<b>FFXI</b> 
Now that the obligation I felt to play has been removed, i've been sort of happy thinking about what I should do now. I've been leveling Corsair a bunch but it costs so much to xp and equip i've been sort of worried about where to find money for all this stuff I <i><a href=""http://ffxi.somepage.com/itemdb/1741"">should</a> <a href=""http://ffxi.somepage.com/itemdb/223"">have</a></i>; or the time to camp it.

"event","My plans for the summer fell throug so it's the fun time summer for me! All Right!!!!!! But, so far this summer i've done...nothing? I think it was fun at first but it's sort of starting to get real boring. Going drinking just tends to get...boring when you do it every day. 

So, what to do to allieviate the boredom? FFXI! Sigh.
Well, since the summer I got BLM to 72, COR to 33, and BRD to 65, made some money, blah blah video game stuff. So why do I keep playing a game i've pretty well finished? 

So, in order to allieviate this problem of boredom and repitition i've started reading a couple books. One is from the past that i've tried to read before and failed and the other is reccomended to me from a Linkshell mate. 

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226096262/sr=8-1/qid=1148573341/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-9794940-3901562?%5Fencoding=UTF8"">Synthetic Worlds : The Business and Culture of Online Games</a> by Edward Castronova

This book is pretty decent for a midnight random pickup at Book People a few months ago. I've taken to reading this at work so it's going sort of slow but it's done wonders for references, quotes, and further readings. I'm looking forward to seeing his conclusions. 

This book gave me a link to another called:

<blockquote><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262201631/ref=pd_sim_b_2/104-9794940-3901562?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155"">Play Between Worlds : Exploring Online Game Culture</a> by T. L. Taylor </blockquote>

which I think I might pick up when I have some more money. 

I've also started reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380813815/qid=1148573670/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-9794940-3901562?s=books&v=glance&n=283155"">Lamb : The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal</a> by Christopher Moore.

This book seems pretty decent. Reworkings of the bible are always fun to read.

My professors last semester sent me a few emails about my paper attempt and I'm sort of happy with their responses. I spend so much time being embarassed by what i'd like to study I never considered that people might actually be interested in it. So, I'll be trying to work on that some this summer as well. I'd like to do more reading before I really get started, however.

So, my summer is work, reading, writing, and video games? Man, my life rules. Netflix don't fail me now!"

It's been a hard week. I'm tired, i'm poor, and i'm back to playing ffxi way too much. I want to world shift in the worst way. What else is there to do when you got 1.89 in your bank account?

"event","So it comes, Finals week. I've learned a lot of things this semester and for some reason, depressing as those learned things have been, i've come out a lot more chipper than I did coming in. This semester seems to have been about rebirth. The long lost Nick LaLone I could barely remember, the one who didn't start talking to himself to pass the time, has come around and decided maybe it was his time to live again. It's times like these I feel like i'm a passenger watching an in-flight movie. It certainly is an interesting movie but i can't help but wonder what happens in the end? So my finals go like this:

Social Psychology - today
Sociology of Law - thursday
Japanese - friday
multicultural relations - friday

Then, i'm done!

This summer will be me trying my best to regain my stumbling finances and learning how to budget my time properly (also: drinking). I'm also going to start jogging on sunday...which sucks but it's time to do it! I'll also be trying to rework my paper and make it go in a direction that makes more sense and makes it seem less hurried! Excitement is my middle name. 

Nonetheless. I have about two or three semesters of college left. It's high time I work for it!

"event","Hello my darlings,

Already a few of you subscribed! I'm flattered. For those who wander through, and miss the info page, I am Bocksey. You have stumbled onto my den of iniquity, and you are welcome to stay if you can do just a couple things for me. I know you won't mind.

1) You have to post here to let me know you want to be friends.

2) You have to have a real journal with LJ. I know, this might be a hassle for anyone coming in from the ether of the net, but let me explain. There is a lot of 'porn' out there for free. It comes in all forms, and you are welcome to glut yourself on them all you want. While I acknowledge that fact, I feel  I am responsible for chosing who I expose to my work. If you have a journal, I can get a sense who you are and your age. It's not a perfect system, but for now it will do.

<b>This</b> is a journal of Erotica.  The stories here involve sex in many flavors, including: Bi/gay/straight, S&M, Bondage, Seduction, Blackmail, Mystery, and Suspense. Oh and don't forget Romance. You will NOT find: Incest, extreme pain, rape, or other activities that are illegal in most parts of the U.S. 

""But Bocksey,"" you say, ""Erotica is just porn! Just let me at it!""

Aw! Isn't that sweet. You have your toilet paper, lotion, and everything. But no, sweetie, it's not. Erotica is LITERATURE, which means in some circles, art. It's carefully crafted, keeping in mind plot, characterization, and mood. The characters in Erotica have lives and families. They have wants and desires, all those little perfections you crave. They just happen to have a lot of fun along the way... sometimes. 

This explanation is  bland, I know, but I want you to know what to expect. Once you have access, you are free and urged to comment. 

Okay, enough of that. See you soon...

Lots of licks,

Bocksey"

"event","Dig it deep,
And hold it there,
Watch as the knife,
Bleeds its share.
Inflicting the pain,
Just so it hurts,
Cutting the memories,
But cursing them first.
The feelings of hate,
The words that rhyme,
The tears that drench,
The blade every time.
Now I feel better,
A scar and a kiss,
Now its all over,
A hit and miss.

-I know what you're thinking-

Err. Mom doesnt know when to just stop. Okay, So I guess I have this bad habit of putting on a show of being happy when I really feel like crap... i just am that way, i hate ruining everyone elses day over me... inplus... no one seems to care anymore... I just always hate being asked whats wrong. but noooo... she doesn't get it, dont ask.... i hate that question, ""What's wrong?""... my other friends always know whats wrong and never have to ask... feeling blah again...

my eyes are burning, my nose is running, my head is aching, and my chest is about to explode, and guess what?!?!? AP test is on monday! fucking A right? 

yea went to the movies with matt tonight.. he's so cute, him and hope are adorable.. i heard all the stories tonight... man i hope me and joel get like that... but one can only imagine until it happens...

i heard this quote today... ""If you believe that dreams can come true, expect a few nightmares...""... hmmm, ponder that one for a bit...

as you might notice i am feeling a little bit crappy i suppose... wish i was with someone... i dont know whats the matter with me... when i am around people i get so into pretending i am happy that i begin to beilev it... but then 5 minutes after they leave and im alone, i am reminded how shitty life is... i wish i could have something like an inflatable friend... lol, ok maybe not to that extremem... but like someone who lived next door, so i could walk over and be like ""Alright... make me happy!""

well i be going now to eat some grilled cheese and tomato soup...

"event","Yea... so I was going through live journal and got this random girls journal up on here and i read her one and only entry... and it says what i feel... so i am going to steal what she says, i take no credit other than saying that i found it... i copied because... well thats how it is... at least i am telling you i am...

""i need to stop being so sad, except sadness just doesn't stop when you want it to. i wish it did though.
i think too much in the first place, and now that i'm sad, i'm thinking incredibly too much for my own good, since you know, it's making things worse on me.
i don't feel like crying and having my face be red and my eyes puffy, so i will hold them back the best that i can.
and whenever i'm like this, i get this huge knot in my throat and it's hard to breathe, correctly that is. ""

yea... i've stopped crying... i mean... i couldn't stop myself when i started like so i had to just lay in the darkness in ym cave of sorrow and just beg God that i could fall asleep... fucking insomnia... fucking dreams... yea... i think about ryan moving, rett, tiara, mike.. everything... i cant take it.. i cant eat... i throw up when i do... i cant sleep i have horrible night mares if i do (i feel like a little kid saying that, but when you see your best friends all dead... you'd feel the same as i do)... idk... what is this all that i feel? depression.. maybe maybe not.. but i think i am going to lighten up when its just me and myself and let the world turn and jump into life... good idea? no... it wont work.. oh well.. i over think life... but then again.. who doesn't from time to time? the proble is it' 24/7 for me and i cant shut my brain off... blah"

"event","Yea...Rudolph called and apologized yesterday...he was sincere about it... he's my best friend... i cant just leave him alone... i love him, i really do... he hurts so bad... i cry over him too much... he said every hateful and hurtful thing he said to me it wasn't true... he was... confused, lost, hurt, feeling lonely... yesterday at church i was tickling his back (he loves it, and i would go to his house every night to put him to sleep just so i can relax and think) it's the best way to think... he started rubbing my leg and grabbed my hand a few times... it was in the best friend love way... i missed his touch... i miss him.. but i have to control everything, hes got a new girlfriend... we talked about her yesterday, briefly, on the phone... i wonder if he loves her? i'll ask him one day.. he pretended to be happy for me about the whole mike thing... hmmm... what he doesn't understand is that i am not with mike because of him... out of all the hateful and hurtful things he said that nearly killed me, i still loved him for who he was... i knew it wasnt him fully speaking to me those days... he's my best friend, and i would do anything and everything for him, i'd die for him... would he do the same for me? i dunno... who knows? i really would put everything on the line for him to be happy... and i am right now... i am sacraficing my sanity, my heart, my love, my fellings for him to be happy with lindsey, i cant mess that up with him and her...he seems too happy, too satisfied... if only i could talk to her once... i want to see if she'll take care of him... i want to let her know that when he gets mad, let him cool off before she starts to try to make him happy again... that he likes soft and gentle voice at night... that he loves fun... he likes yellow and red underware... he may act like a kid all the time, but if you really need him for you to cry on his shoulder he'd be there in a second.. he talks sence into you if you're being stupid... he really does care, no matter what you may think... he'll do somethings without thinking and it'll sometimes ruin your plans with him or what you wanted to do, but justgo along with it, it usually turns out to be fun anyways... if he does something that you dont like at all or hurts you, tell him, nicely, he doesn't take hints and he responds better to you being straight forward...he has a guilty look to him when he's doing something wrong like stealing the lock off your locker or taking your hairtie so you wont put up your hair... dont make fun of his hips, he's sensitive about them... he loves cuddling and eating the plastic off his cups... that when he says ""Trying something new"" he means Diet Coke... he doesn't like chocolate... surprise him as much as you can, with little things and he'll smile, and that always brightened up my day... if you call him and wake him up, he'll pretend to not care and pretend he wants to stay on- trust me, he doesn't, let him sleep and tell him to call you later, if he doesn't call, call him, it means he didn't remember you two ever communticating... you'll know he loves you when he rubs your face with his hand and look into your eyes and flash his sweet smile and kiss you ever so gently... and if you sit and listen to him breathe on the phone, it gets softer and slower when he gets more and more tired fighting to stay awake with you while you are on past his 'bed time' but he'll always stay on if you ask... not to take him for granted cause she has the greatest guy... the one i love with every beat  of my heart and every breath i take... *sigh* i would do anything to end any of his pain... and i'll just step on out and let him run the show... yea... crying again... thinking of all that past with him hurts... i wish he was here so we could talk... maybe i could tell him and make sure he knows that i would cry if he died too, and i care about him so much that i loved/love him too, that if he ever needed to call- dont hesitate... i wish i told him how i felt on the phone yesterday... i blew it... like always... i always fuck things up... i wish i could tell him how sorry i am... if i could take it back and redo January 9th over again, i would, because what brught us closer together also broke us apart... *sigh*... i looked at those pictures of me and him for the first time n a few weeks... i wish we could go back... i set my heart up for the greatest fall... but we can only go forward in life i suppose... well i must go now.. sleep time...

if only he knew how i felt on the inside.. that what he sees on the outside is only the beginning... i actually am very happy for him and lindsey..."

""Stupid Kid""

There are things that used to make me smile
One of them was you for just a little while
You left me for dead so far away
I replace you with fear and shame
You'll be happy on the day that I die

There are things that used to make me laugh
But now they're deeply buried in the past
I left them there so far away
Replaced my humor with my pain
I'll be happy the day that it dies

Remember when I said I love you
Well forget it I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back everyword I said

There are things that used to make you cry
One of them was me for just a little while
Why is it that you had to say Goodbye
In your special little way

Remember when I said I love you
Well forget it I tak it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back everyword i said

- Alkaline Trio

Yeah... so there you go...
All these feelings i feel now.. why does it still hurt to see you? *sigh* i like to pretend to the others in the group that i am over you as they call you names... even kayla calls you names... yea... why do i want to scream out ""Shut up, he's my best friend, he's not like that... you dont understand.. he's going through a phase! he'll be back.. he always does come back""
No not this time huh? yea... i must learn... i want a boyfriend so you can get jealous... i see your face when i talk to nick.. you want to come over and kill him... haha... i give you my "" you know you want it... but you cant have it you little peice of shit"" face... ryan loves that face... so another day passes with out you... and i miss you less with everyday that you're gone..."

""Here's Your Letter""

Cut the skin to the bone
Fall asleep all alone
Hear your voice in the dark
Loose myself in your eyes
Choke my voice Say godnight
Fuck I can't let this kill me... let go
I need some more time to fix this

Here's a letter for you
But the words get confused
And the conversation dies
Apologize for the past
Talk some shit, take it back
Are we cursed to this life?

My life just lost all meaning
Do one thing for me tonight
I'm dieing in this silence

The last star left in heaven
It's falling down to earth and
Do you still feel the same way?

Fuck I can't let this kill me... let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this...


""I'm Lost Without You""

I swear that I can go on forever again
Please let me know when my one bad day will end
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin

Are you afraid of being alone?
Cause I am... I'm lost without you
Are you afriad of leaving tonight?
Cause I am... I'm lost with out you

I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now?
I can hear footsteps... I'm dreaming
And if you will keep me from waking, to believe this

Are you afriad of being alone?
Cause I am... I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight?
Cause I am... I'm lost without you


""Always""

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dieing
And yourhands they shake of goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me

So here I am, I'm trying
So here i am, are you ready?

Come on let me hold you
Touch you
Feel you
Always
Kiss you
Taste you
All night
Always

And I'll miss your laugh, your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me
I'm so sick of fights, I hate them
Lets start this agin for real

So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

Come on let me hold you
Touch you
Feel you
Always
Kiss you
Taste you
All night
Always"

"event","You say you love me
You say you miss me
You say you need me
You say you're jealous of the other guys
You say I'm the best never to be replaced
You say you dream of me
You say I am beautiful
You say I have what you need and more
You say I am your best friend and I say you're mine
You say you miss my smell
You say you miss my taste
You say you miss my laugh
You say it all....
But the things you dont say are what you need to say...
You need to say ""How about a movie?""
You need to say ""Can I kiss you?""
You need to say ""Lets be together""
You need to say ""You're my one and only""
But the things you dont say are the things you need to say...
So what can i say?"

went to my friends bday par-tay after the play on friday... let me tell you i was not welcomed at all... she use to claim to be my best friend.. yeah i never had the heart to tell her that i could never trust her and that she doesn't know anything about me... the only two person who knows me 100% and still loves me is... oh yeah i told myself i wouldn't put names down... we'll call him... Rudolph (yeah no one would get that nickname except him...) heneways... i had to go somewhere on friday night unwelcomed and feeling pretty uncomfortable... recieving dirty looks all night from the ""birthday girl""... then at 2a.m., when everyone else was sleeping, my other friend asked if me and her could talk... and let me tell you i was soooo overjoyed to be at least spoken to (sarcastic).... me and her were talking until 4:45 in the morning, and then went to bed and woke up at 8:30 (yay!)... then i decided to go surfing and then to the pool with my sister... and then while i was outside hosing off the tanning oil, my friend from drama called me, which, let me tell ya, was a big surprise and made me feel loved... well anyways, i went to Triplets of Bellville with my two friends (you've gotta see it! it's really amazing, the animation is very original and the dog is my favourite!)... apart from feeling accepted, i was having a really good relaxing time... we went back to one of their houses and watched Family Guy (why the fuck Fox cancelled it still elludes me) and then went to school for the play... which is alot of fun... i am in a whole nother world during the play, not only on stage but off it too... always perfecting your performance (even with my two lines!!)... man all the girls in this play are so beautiful... just being in the same performance with them is intimidating... maybe one day in a couple of years some freshman will think the same about me... maybe not... oh well... we went to the cast party... i didn't want to drink... oh well, i still did... theres me, the chameleon... all the drinking i did made me depressed and it was bad... i didn't want to start crying, cause i was so worried about my sister... so i crawled up on my friends lap and slept... he took care of me... it was really nice of him... i feel bad now... he shouldn't have to... i should of just got someother ride home or something... *sigh*...my sister kept calling me during the party cause she got stoned with her boyfriend and she got in one of those moods that was driving me nuts... i am 15... i am not suppose to be taking care of my sister like this... thats what parents are for... fucking no good parents of mine are never home, and blamed me for my sister cutting herself... of coarse it's my fault... i was suppose to be watching her making sure she was ok... i am suppose to make her dinner everynight, making sure she does her homework, making sure she brushes her teeth before she goes to bed... while my parents are off not caring about us... well fuck them... once i get my fucking car, me and my sister are out of here for the whole summer living on icing and pop tarts with Rudolph and my sisters boyfriend... for the whole summer... just driving...


***Song of the day***

Round n' round
Carousel
Has got you under it's spell
Moving so fast...but
Going nowhere

Up n' down
Ferris wheel
Tell me how does it feel
To be so high...
Looking down here

Is it lonley?
Lonley?
Lonley?

Did the clown
Make you smile?
He was only your fool for a while
Now he's gone back home
And left you wandering here

Is it lonley?
Lonley?
Lonley?

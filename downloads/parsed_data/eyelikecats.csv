"event","My weekend was rather interesting.  Chris and I had been planning on going to georgia this weekend, so he could meet my psychotic family and what not.  So after work about 3:30 I'm taking the dog out so he can use the bathroom before we leave, but I get stung by a wasp or some shit on the end of my finger before even getting off my porch.  After much ranting, raving, cussing, and trying to find someone to take care of the dog while we're gone, we finally get out of the apartment.  We stop to buy some benadryl for my hand.  We drive to Rome, get there about 8ish, and and hang out with pam will bec and sarah (aunt, uncle, and cousins) for a little while.  they all seemed to like chris.  my hand hurt like hell and was swollen pretty good, but william said all i could do for it was take benadryl, so whatever.  So about 9:30 we drive to nanny's (my grandmother on my mom's side) and visit with her before going to bed.  we spent the night in with her in georgia and then got up at 5:30, which is 4:30 in alabama and go with her to cherokee, nc so she can gamble at harrahs.  I take benadryl all day so I sleep half the time and walk around half dead the rest of the time, because benadryl really knocks you out.  My hand looks like those little plastic gloves you get at the doctor, when you blow them up.  Literally.  No sarcasm.  And it hurts like hell.  So we drive back to nanny's house, then I call joyce and gene (my grandparents on my dad's side) and tell them we're in town.  We decide to spend the night with them, so we drive over to their house.  By the time we get to their house, not only is my hand about to explode and hurt like hell, but it's moving up to my arm and swollen almost all the way to my elbow.  So after visiting with joyce and gene for about two hours, me and joyce decided to go to the emergency room, so me, chris, and joyce all go to the hospital.  We get there about midnight and are there for about 4 hours.  Me and chris sat in the little room they stick you in by yourself and watched two movies, deep blue sea, which was horrible, but lots of fun to make fun of, and the beginning of starship troopers, and I still haven't figured out if it's a serious movie or a spoof of something, but we made fun of it too.  So, I finally got a steroid shot in the butt, 2 painkillers, 2 antibiotics, and a prescription for painkillers and antibiotics.  i don't have insurance so when I checked out I put $90 on my credit card for the DOWN PAYMENT.  I will be billed for the rest, but they didn't know how much it was going to be.  I guess I'll be paying for that for the next two years.  yay!  The swelling has gone down some, but my hand and wrist are still really swollen and hurt.  i still have the blown up doctors glove look.  Hopefully I'll be all better in a few days.  I did get a nifty hospital bracelet when I was there.  Looks like the kind babies wear when they are born.  I'm still wearing it.  I'm gonna wear it to work tommorow and tell everyone I went to the emergency room because my arm was going to explode.  fun stuff.  So this afternoon me and chris drove back from georgia and we've been here about an hour now."

"event","Ok.  So lots has happened.   Hmmm...  I finished my big ass tattoo last night.  Was ready to bite nails or scream or pass out by the end of it.  I had a death grip on Chris's arm (wouldn't be surprised if he has bruises today).  It looks good though, still hurts like hell.  I'm sitting in the living room, typing on the computer, with no shirt on, just a blanket in front of me.  I don't want anything to touch my tattoo.  I think it took about 5 hours to color the whole thing in.  I'm finally finished.  Pretty much anyway, I'll have to go back in two more weeks to get touch ups.  The issue with red is that you can't tell whats blood and whats ink, and he said I was bleeding the ink out faster than he could put it in. So I'll have to get a few spots touched up, but it won't be anything like yesterday.  I stand by my statement that my fear of childbirth has dramatically decreased since getting this tattoo.

So, me and Rick are no longer together, after more than a year, I ended it the other day.  He took it well when I told him, but that night was interesting.  

So now I'm dating Chris.  Yes, my roommate, Chris.  Its a little strange that we've lived together for a year, and just now starting to date, but it's cool.  I've never dated anyone I was friends with beforehand.  The transition was a little strange to begin with, but I think we've both gotten into the groove of it.

We're going to the Humane Society to get a dog tomorrow.   I so excited!  I can't wait!  I'm finally gonna have a puppy!!!!!   YAY!!!  My head is going to explode when we go, because I'm going to want all the puppies there.  I'm gonna be like oooh I want that one, no I want that one, no that one,  ohh i want them all, then BOOM!  I just won't be able to take it.  The cuteness will kill me.

...Oh yeah, And Autumn's going to Texas. My Autie is going to leave me.  I've tried to talk her out of going, but she seems to be set in her decision.  I'm blaming her friend, well boyfriend, now.  He came to visit from Texas, and was going to move here.  Then the next thing I hear is that my sister is moving to Texas and wants me to go with her.  Stupid girl.  I don't want to go back to Texas (not right now anyway), and I don't want her to go either.  Oh well, maybe she'll miss us after a few months and decide to come back.

So that's that."

"event","Well...  I now have a big ass tattoo.  It starts between my shoulder blades and goes all the way down my spine.  I must say that I don't think I have ever felt pain like that before.  I get to go back in two weeks and get it colored.  Yay, more pain.  It'll be worth it.  I was starting to get nervous before I got it, but I'm glad now.  The guy that did my tattoo was the most sanitary person I have ever seen (which was definately reassuring) and he did a great job.  I'm not worried about it looking good, I'm just dreading the pain when I get it colored it.  Chris went with me to get it done and watched it all.  I didn't cry but it was damn close enough to make me want to.  Call me and come see me if you want to see it.  Maybe I'll post a picture of it in a day or two.  I have been so sore.  I can barely sit back.  I have pain...  Very interesting to drive.  Also interesting finding different people to rub lotion on me and saranwrap me.  I have been wearing saranwrap for 24 hours now, which is definately a new experience.  I feel like leftovers or something.

Another note, got interesting news today.  A bit unexpected...  But I think it's good news...

To kala and chris - thanks for rubbing me down and saranwrapping me."

"event","Everything seems to look different at night.  When you're laying in bed trying to go to sleep.  When you're alone.  and lonely.  and can't sleep...  again.   You lay there trying to think about nothing so you'll fall asleep, but of course, that doesn't work.  So you just lay there thinking about anything that happens to float through your mind... which is quite a lot at 4 in the morning apparently.   You lay there and think about all the relationships that have affected you.  Friendships, relationships,  love, hate, or both.  They all seem to just come and go.  I think about all the relationships I've had, all the people I've known, and how they just slowly seep away.  They never really have a real ending, they just kind of ooze into oblivion.  I wonder about the relationships I have now, romantic and friendship.  Where will they be in a year?  or two?   Will we be closer?   Will we even speak?   Or will one or both of us be dead?   **come on, can't be all happy now**  Well, I guess that is one way that my relationship may end abruptly instead of oozing into oblivion.  Death is pretty abrupt.  You can't really lay awake at night and not touch on that one in some way, shape, or form.  I can't anyway.  Not anymore.  Not since I realized what happens when people actually die....   

Anyway, that wasn't the topic.  Although it did need to be broached, it's not the actual subject.   Although there is no real subject aside from not being asleep.  ..I'm cold...   fire would be nice...

Yay for fire.  And especially yay for fireplaces.  I'm so glad my apartment has a fireplace.  It's so nice to catch things on fire and not get in trouble for it.   It's rather pleasant to start a fire at 4 in the morning when you can't sleep.  ...I'm so glad none of my roommates have thought to close the flu since we've lived here or I would've killed us all by now.  Off of that subject now.

I'm such a lazy ass.  I never want to work.  But who does, really?  I do like my job though.  As far as working goes, if i have to go somewhere,  I like having to go to the one I have.  I made $100 tonight.  Not bad.  It was pretty busy, but it didn't get crazy, so it's definately nice to go in for 6 hours, make over $100, and then go home.  Unfortunately, where you would normally go to sleep after that, you instead sit up writing on your stupid livejournal because your dumb ass can't sleep.  again.  Don't know why. I didn't have caffeine or anything.  This is also the second time in about a week for me not to be able to sleep.  It's ok though because I'm off tomorrow.   Another good thing about my job.  They apparently know that I'm a lazy ass, so they don't bother giving me alot of shifts.  I also have tuesday and thurs off, including sundays.  doesn't bother me any as long as I can pay rent, and I already have rent for next month, so I'm set.   I will have to sleep tomorrow night though, since I'm working a double monday.  That ought to be an easy shift though, aside from working 10 hours.  And I'll prob only make about $40, but thats why you work friday and saturday.  Those are the nights for rent money.  The rest is gas money.   Damn gas prices.

The fire is really going good now.  I'm actually warm now.  Stupid weather.  70 degrees one day.   Making me want to go swimming in january and then we have stupid 30 degree weather.  And I go out thinking it's gonna be warm, so I don't bother to take a jacket anywhere and I'm lucky if I have a long sleeve shirt with me.  Have the heat on one day and the air running the next.  Stupid.   i do get to play with fire though, so I can't complain too much.   Unless I'm complaining about not sleeping.   Then i can complain.    Dammit.


I have downloaded the hell out of some music / music videos in the last week since chris moved his computer into the living room.   He's gonna get on his computer one day soon and be like 'what the hell IS all this shit?'  And then i will have to confess that my lame ass has had way too much free time and apparently can't thinkof anything better to do than download a bunch of shit on his computer.  Some of it's funny though.  Like the version of barbie girl i found that's sung in german or dutch or something.  Very amusing.   Chris thought so too, so maybe he'll forgive me for some of the crap on his computer.  I did get a new ringtone though.  It's GIR from invader zim singing the doom song.  It's great.   I love gir.  watching invader zim makes me happy.
                    ...i'm such a sad person...
but i do like gir.  it's funny.  very random.  and i like it, so that's all that matters.

so there.

i like fire...    and sleep...

my toenails are blue.  and my hair is red.   wow, i was about to try to make a rhyme with that.  so glad i came to my senses before doing that.  i really must be sleepy.  Thoroughly agitating that i can't sleep.  Not really something i have an issue with often.  especially twice in one week.  oh well... i'm thirsty.  ... and now I'm going to drink a bunch of water.  That way, when i finally fall asleep, i can wake up every hour to go to the bathroom.   yay for thinking things through.   i'm gonna drink my water now.  i should drink some of that vodka or tequila that's in the freezer.  Drink enough of that and I could probably go to sleep.  or puke.  one or the other.  ...don't really feel like it though.  so i'll just sit here writing this neverending journal entry while i warm my tootsies next to the fire.

I would just like to apologize now to anyone that actually read this whole post.  I'm very, very sorry that you are actually going through my thinking process at 4, no, 5 in the morning, when I can't sleep after working a saturday night shift as a waitress. 

What i would like to know, is how does someone work a shift like I just worked and then not be able to sleep?  huh?  that's one to think over.  Not that it was a bad shift or anything,  i did good, made good money.  But I did stay busy as hell.  I should be snoring away, but no.  I'm warming my tootsies writing the neverending journal entry.  **again, very sorry to anyone that might read this**   I would normally make something this long and pointless a private entry, but i don't actually think i've EVER written an entry this long, so I'm semi-proud of it, so everyone will be subjected to it.   sorry.   but only kinda.

I'm gonna be really pissed off if I click update, and i get kicked off the internet.  That would be my luck.  I'm gonna try it.

YAY!!!!  IT WORKED!!!   So now I'm editing.  

Kala got up thinking I'd just gotten home, but no, just couldn't sleep again.  Hey Kala, if your reading this.   And hey to chris if you're reading this too, since i mentioned you earlier.  She was cold.  I told her that was why I started the fire.  So I could warm my tootsies.  yay for tootsies.  or at least the word tootsies.  i like it.  it's a good word.  strange but actually means something.  kinda like my relationships.  strange but means something.  

yeah... i definately need some sleep.  I'm incoherently rambling now.  Damn.  Who knew I could ramble so long about absolutly nothing?  Well, at least I haven't started ranted about anything.  Aside from the small weather rant, that one doesn't count because it was small.  Although I suppose you could refer to this whole neverending entry as one long rant about not being able to sleep.  oh well.

I want someone to cuddle with.  yeah...  someone to cuddle with in front of the fireplace.   that would really be nice.  cuddling and fire.   it doesn't get any better than that.   ...   i take that back.  It could get better than that, but that's all I really want right now.  cuddling and fire.  I'm halfway there so i suppose all isn't lost.  I guess I could always go get kala and get her to cuddle with me, but she wasn't really who i had in mind.  **sorry kala, i still love you though**

What time does the sun rise?  I know the other day, i was still awake at 6 when chris left for work and the sun still hadn't come up.  I went to bed right after that though, so i actually missed the sunrise.  I don't really WANT to watch the sunrise, but I suppose if i'm up when it happens, then I guess I'll watch it.  Haven't really seen that many sunrises.  Might be nice.  

I think our critter is visiting again.  Damn mouse that ate all my cat food.  I guess it's ok though since the kittie never came back.  *sad face* I miss the kittie.  I need an animal.  I need something to cuddle with.  A cat or a dog or something.  I had a snake, but that doesn't really count.   That's not really a real pet.  You can't really do anything with it anyway.  Although it did poop on kala, which was great.  She didn't really appreciate it, but the snake definately earned some brownie points in my book.  Of course, then he found his freedom.  And now I have an empty snake cage that I don't know what to do with.  And perhaps a snake loose in the apartment.  He probably got eaten my the mice.  Maybe that's what happened to the kittie.  all the mice ganged up on the kittie and ate her.  wow, that's pretty horrible if you think about it...  i don't think i'll think about it anymore.  hopefully kittie just got kidnapped by some nice family that didn't bother to think about whether or not someone might miss the cat if they decided to adopt it.  but oh well, i guess that's what you get for not keeping it inside or putting a collar on it.  *another sad face* i need a cat.  a black one.  and i will name it BOO

I need to go back to school.  At least then I would have something to study on nights that i couldn't sleep.  Maybe I'd pass some of my classes if i slept a little less.  then i could get a real job.  yay.  lets work 8 to 5, monday through friday...  i'm doomed.  I don't want a real job.  not yet.  of course, if i go to college, that would give me an excuse for at least three, maybe four or five, years not to get a real job.  Of course, if i go to college, get a degree, and then continue working as a waitress, like some of the people i work with, then I'm going to be really ticked off.  That would be alot more on my student loan to pay off than i have now.  damn college and its damn expenses.  i could go into nursing.  that's what i was thinking about doing.  then i could poke and prod people's owies.  now wouldn't that be fun???   yay for blood and pus and nastie things.  I think I'll go puke now.   Ah, the realities of life.  At least I'm not having any children yet.  Talk about wanting to puke.  I'm not ready to be a mother.  My children are going to be seriously twisted anyway.  I'm going to end up raising a psycho killer or something.   Of course,  I will be the root of all the problems, but then that would also explain why i would be the first victim.   yay for babies.  lets have lots.  babies everywhere.   i really am doomed.  I don't need to have any influence over any impressionable mind.  ever.  keep your children locked far away.

"event","I've had a rather frustrating day.  Got my paycheck.  Not what I thought it was going to be.  They took like a third of my check out in taxes.  They're going to check it on monday and see if it's right...  If it is, then i'll get a new job because that's bullshit.  (in my personal opinion)   Plus they want me to be the hostess trainer (because all the other hostesses are retarded and have no clue what they're doing - like its that hard) but I was told today that I probably wouldn't make more than I'm already making.  My manager was like ""youre already making 3 or 4 dollars more than all the other hostesses, so that probably won't change.""  So I'm like, well then what I'm doing isn't going to change.  You want me to do extra work, train these dumb ass girls that have brain damage because they don't understand what a rotation is, yet you don't want to pay me anymore.   Lets see:   do the same thing I always do and make the same amount... do more than I normally do and... still make the same amount.   How about... fuck you.  I'll get a new job.  Good luck with your brain damaged hostesses, train them yourselves.  

sorry.  i'm a little angry.

onto a more pleasant note.....

damn... there isn't one


I dreamed about trey last night.  It was nice to be able to see him, but I was sad when I woke up.  I miss him.  I suppose some things will never change."

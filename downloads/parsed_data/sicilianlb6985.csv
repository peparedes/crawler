"event","So yeah, here I sit. This would be what we call a short lived Saturday night seeing as Saturday night for me used to go on into the wee hours of the morning lol, like 5AM and shit. Don't miss the exhaustion, but goddamn, wouldn't it be better than sittin here?

As if you'd all care, lemme first say that I started the day at work! LOL Went okay, I'm finally hittin the sales floor! How nice is that? LOL I passed all my tests! Haha, my manager seems to be pretty impressed! CUZ I CHEATED! Haha, but hey, why not? It's all bullshit anyway!

Umm, I ran a couple miles today over in Cranford! What fun! My life is SOOO INTERESTING!!! I got nothin' else better to do anyway than run till I pass out and die! Maybe I'll get lucky one of these days? Let's cross our fingers shall we?

Beautiful surprise in Sewaren today! HA, how come when you want to escape certain things they come back and haunt you even months after you've left? Don't ask me, if I knew I wouldn't be askin the question! lol I'm so stupid and exhausted. HOWEVER I DID get to see my Boff tonight vistin from Monmouth University! I miss Boffmaster sooo fuckin much! I wish I was in college at the moment truthfully. But I guess it's all for the best after all.. got time to prepare before I hit up UCC in January lol. I can't wait! Ahaa!

So anyways, I dunno, life is bullshit at the moment. I'm borrred as usual.  I'm not a mental case LOL I swear, but I'm jus bummed out tonight. I have my days, unfortunately, tonight was one of them.

Figured out some shit tonight... but unfortunately a lot of shit that I could say is a little too personal for this PUBLIC journal. NOT THAT anyone would care ANYWAY!!!

Goddamn, I jus realized... I REALLY like the Trance Control songs. Ok but my mind is dead, this entry was supposed to be interesting, but guess what, as you've prolly noticed, IT'S NOT! BIG FUCKING SURPRISE!

Ok and now motivational words from my almighty Cioff::
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - 
AL TI MA GRL 02: no one can replace you
Thanks Flexxx, at least someone realizes that! Hahaha!

And now some comedy::

CoLoMBiAnPaPo: but i have the whitest ass
SiCiLiANLB 69 85: hahaha
CoLoMBiAnPaPo: definitely a moon color

SexyCat1185: i understand...
SiCiLiANLB 69 85: You had better
SiCiLiANLB 69 85: Good night

<b>And there you have it... LB3 isn't exactly an organization you want to tangle with... it could get you in big trouble...</b>

A little less from the austere side... I was thinking today about many things. Some days you wake up and wonder what the fuck is going on? I start questioning friends, life, people in general... it's all pretty stupid.

I've recently discovered that I'm pretty fuckin jealous... I never realized that before... what is this sudden change in personality? In the past, I've always been the least jealous person I know... the most indifferent thinking of anybody. AND NOW... JEALOUSY. And it's a selfish jealousy too... in fact, it's straight up fuckin retarded! Maybe it's just me, but lately I feel like I got nobody... at least no one solid. And the one or two people that are solid, I fuckin blew off today and in the past... I dunno, we won't get into how long. Anyways, the one person I'm talking about, I usually talk to on a daily basis and have known all my life. SO I sense something... but it's hard to describe. I guess maybe it's too personal to write in this ONLINE journal where everyone can see... but sometimes I think it's all fake. Maybe I'm too posessive, maybe I'm just mental... but the fact is, any single person can do whatever the hell they want.. but when something comes up with this ""person""... I take it personally and it drives me crazy. I hold higher standards in anything that's done... and when I feel like the person doesn't truly understand or isn't really there, I can't take the thoughts. So maybe it's time to take a step back for the sake of my dignity and detach myself emotionally from it all. BECAUSE, when it comes down to it, I realize there's people above me in their eyes and it only makes me feel stupid and inadequate. It's hard to put into words and I'm not about to go into detail so I'm trying to be general, but FUCK!! I'm pissed the fuck off... maybe I've been thinking too much...

I think I'm falling into a hole of insanity with no way out or any means of escape. I guess I'll just let myself go until it's done and overwith... for now, I guess I have no choice but to keep on going. And now I look back on what I just wrote and it doesn't make sense, but that's ok, cuz it makes perfect sense to me! YOU JUST DON'T KNOW the in-between details. Haha, lately I wish I could live in the area of the sniper... someone shoot me... maybe I should resign my position within LB3."

SiCiLiANLB 69 85: :: ORGASMS AND EJACULATES ALL OVER KEYBOARD ::

SiCiLiANLB 69 85: Ahh the beauty of dryness... if only we could all be born with it

Ok, now if you didn't think that was funny... you don't have dry humor. Dry humor is very exclusive... many people are born without it. In fact 98% of the population DO NOT have dry humor.


<b>Ok, and now some more dry humor between me and the Dawn-meister:</b>
SiCiLiANLB 69 85: ok so yeah, any dry stories for me?
SiCiLiANLB 69 85: OMG I GOT SOMETHING DRY

AHH, it doesn't get any better than this folks LMAO... holy shit, I'm so dry tonight I don't think I'll be able to sleep! Aright, I'm about to go now... jus figured I'd start this thing back up again and I'm thinking about using this to promote dryness among our nation's people.

Oh and one more thing before I go... LB3 now has two new policies...
1. Canonization: The process by which LB3 sends the MAFIA to place a cannon in front of someone's house because of wrongdoing.
2. Skin ripping: Select LB3 members now possess the unique ability to rip skin off of offending commoners at will.

Ok that's it for now... I may update tomorrow, I may not... it depends on whether Dawn updates hers or not... let's pray she does.

So I'm fuckin pissed the fuck off and aggravated. Nothin seems to be workin out very well lately for some reason. So tomorrow, my father's gonna decide whether I get it back or not. I'm jus sick of dealing with this issue day after fuckin day... I want my goddamn car the fuck back already.

Red Fucking Lobster never gave me a call back so I'm still fuckin jobless and interviewless. I really really need money.... I feel like a fuckin loser. Hopefully, a good word gets put in by my friend's friend, but if things don't work out there, then I'll just have to look elsewhere. Or I could work at Ace Hardware, haha. But who knows, I just want a goddamn job again.

And now we come to the ""MB Project"" as I call it. I'm TEN TIMES closer to finding the perpetrator. Fair warning, LB3 is gearing up for a royal rumble...... and please be aware that we ARE in possession of weapons of mass destruction. Wow, I could get myself in trouble on here saying shit like that, haha... but um yeh, I dunno. LB3 will not fail!

"event","Well, basically, I've concluded upon the fact that Victoria is one funny motherfucker. Plus, the fact that she is betrothed to Ronald McDonald definitely boosts her hilarity factor. Recently, in our past conversations, we have established that Victoria will have a wonderful life with her McDonald's friends. I keep telling her I can picture eating Chicken Fajitas with all of Ronald's friends (The McDonald's Clan). And basically, I've been laughing at the fact that her lover wears more makeup than her!

NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES... picture Victoria standing nude with her lover Ronald McDonald. Now picture her having sex and ripping out Ronald's red hair with pleasure.
OK NOW... picture Victoria waking up in the morning after a night of wild hamburger sex and having white makeup all over her body from Ronald. Ahh, the graphic hilarity of Victoria's sick mind.

OK, and aside from that, picture Ronald stoned off his ass... LMAO That'd be hilarious. He'd go to order a #2 and he'd be asked what kind of drink he wanted, and he'd reply... ""Umm, yeah, I dunno!"" LMAO! I dunno, isn't this very dry?

Yeah so I'm done. If you'd like to know... uh... I forget. I dunno so I'll write later!"

Consolidation is going ok... but even though everything is getting a little better, tonight I just got the feeling things weren't goin that great after all. Which is stupid and dumb. The only thing I can do is hope things get better, but who the fuck even knows if it will. It's not worth even thinking about for now. I'm jus tryin to live my life the best I can all the while trying to have a little fun... ok a lot of fun LMAO, but that's not ALWAYS possible. I don't even know what the fuck I'm even talking about now cuz I just forgot.

Forget I wrote that paragraph. I'm still waitin for my phone call from the place I wanna work at... they better call for my interview! I passed the fuckin test and everything was all good... so now I'm waitin for my call. I need a job... NOWWWW! I wanna get my speakers and shit REAL soon, and FUCK, I'm just so broke and shit. FUCK MONEY.

I'm so fuckin confused, dumb, and um, I forget what else I was gonna fuckin say. I'm all out of it tonight and it sucks. The first thing I'm doing when I get my car back is smokin a big fat blunt. That's what I concluded upon. Being non-mobile really sucks.

I wanna go to Seaside again! I never wrote an entry about Seaside because the days after it were so fuckin bad I wasn't in the mood. But yeh, I had fun rollin by the water, it was very interesting to roll on the beach. I felt one with the seagulls LMAO. I dunno though, I got a passion for the shore. I fuckin love the beach and the whole atmosphere of bein down the shore. I'm definitely goin sometime soon again. In the meantime, ... uh, I don't even know what I wanna write anymore! I have so much fuckin stuff to say but I forgot what it all was! Too tired... I think it's definitely best I just get the fuck off here. I'm jus gonna sleep all the shit outta my head for now. Wednesday is my salvation day... I need my car again!! I FUCKIN NEED it real bad. WEDNESDAY is the day! I can't fuckin wait.

Dawn, sorry I couldn't stay last night with all you guys... I just fucked up, that's why! Next time I'm going about things different.. I'll meet YOU instead of you meeting ME.. haha cuz I was stupid and I should've known better. So sorry about that, next time will be much better. By the way, did that kid ever find his dog? LOL, that sucks.

What else?? Ok, I definitely have nothing more to say for now but that I'm bored and looking for something to do, so whoever sees this first, hit me up or I'll hit you up after my shower or somethin. I gotta piss so fuckin bad right now! The longer I hold though, the better it'll feel when I release LMAO. Ok I'm officially done, I'll write more tonight."

Which was all fine until I smoked a few stoges and felt rushes of weirdness go right through me. Call me crazy, but I shit you not. Hahha, I'm not one to pull a... well, LB knows what I'm talking about. I really did not feel good last night and in fact, I couldn't even sleep through the night. I was definitely feeling something... don't ask me what cuz I have NO idea... I've only done deeka ONCE before two days ago, and that was even STRONGER and I didn't feel like I did yesterday and the day before. Hahaha, very very weird. Also I didn't appreciate my not feeling well being downplayed by an impressive performance of fucked-upness. I was hot, sweaty, had blurred vision, and very touched in the head, and I had to deal with phoneys phoneying it the fuck up!! I think the best medicine I could've had last night was to go hunting and shoot some birds... AND I AM NOT Talking about PHEASANT this time!

Alright too much ramble... today I think I was very thoughtful... I was especially overly nice to all my family members and everybody I saw today. In fact, I was so thoughtful I went to go visit my grandparents randomly to spend time with them for an hour or two. How out of character is that? LMAO

Beautiful storm activity in the Central Jersey area tonight... however I had another bad experience with my dog... I think it might have been dehydration but yeh, she wasn't feeling good and I felt awful about it. Usually I'm not so sensitive to others- ESPECIALLY ANIMALS... and whatever they're feelin. I dunno, LMAO.. I'm really sensitive and thoughful today....... fuck my brain yo."

I dunno, I'm pretty tired. AND a special shout to my LB3... don't worry LB, everything will look up, just take it easy and get your mind off  things.

So yeah, I'm dead... early day tomorrow doin the deeka.. its fuckin over."

uhh today was my 17th birthday... picked up my car today and im basically broke.. so maybe when i build my bank account up again ill modify the goddamn thing, but for now, it'll have to stay the way it is and ill have to be thankful i even got the damn thing to begin with to cart my ass around

I went to spiritos today with the family and the goddess.. it was all good, and who do i see when im about to leave?? my moose... yes it was quite the coincidence

yeh im pretty tired tonight... but basically im feelin kinda accomplished cuz here i am 17 already and wondering where the fuck my life went LOL... it seems like it was ripped from me! but im glad i am where i am today (if that made sense)! well anyway, today was a special day because me and the lb recieved a scroll on our doorstep last week proclaiming the big ""1-7"" so of course, you know it had to be quite significant.. but yeh im going... tomorrows another family day, mondays my test & deeka time! its fuckin over!! make no mistake about that!"

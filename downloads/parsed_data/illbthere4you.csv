"event","It feels good to be back in my routine. I go to the gym everyday sometimes twice a day so when i went on vacation i only got to go twice. It was a big change. But now im back into my rountine and it feels good. The gym is possibly the best thing i got into this year. It helps relieve stress and keep me fit. I love it so much. I have been really busy lately so i havent got to update but thats okay because not much is going on. I started rding again too. I hadnt been on a my horse in like a month it felt so weird because i normally ride atleast twice a week. Everything finally is getting back to normal and its nice. 

I was suposed to go to the movies tonight but i didnt. i wont get into that. but im going to go like next monday or something so its all good. I cant write to much because real world austin comes on in five minutes

"event","First of all i give props to the people who update like 3 times a day because i can barely update once a week. But anyways, I have been really confused lately and im trying my best to sort out my feelings but i just cant figure it out. Maybe it will get better over time or something. I sure how so because it isdriving me insane. I try and focus on one thing and it seems like i cant concentrate or focus on it. It scares me a little bit. I have been going to the gym alot lately. I think it really helps me get rid of alot of stress. If i werent going there i think i would be alot more stressed out and confused. Also the whole buddypic.com thing or whatever were everyone thinks its me. I dont know because i cant see it for some reason but i have never heard of that site so i dont know how it could be unless someone else put it there. Hmm more confusing stuff i have to think about. Ill save that one for the gym tommorrow.

school is nearing its end and summer is getting closer. I am happy and sad at the same time. Im gonna miss seeing my friends every day because i love you guys so much, but ill be able to do more stuff because we wont be at school seven hours a day. But since school is so close to being out i want to say somethings. I owe everything to my friends. I could not have made it through one second of the year if you guys werent by my side. I know there was alot of drama throughout the year but it was a great time to find out who your true friends are. Im not going to name certain people because i think that every one of you have helped me be a better person. But i would also like to thank my best friends for helping me through life in the times that it gott tough. I owe that all to you guys. Im gonna be sad the year is over but every good thing must come to an end. I also want  to take them time to say that i love you guys so much and if it werent for you i would have never made it. I wish you guys knew how much you all meant to me.

Wow do i love that song.. the begining is so sad it  goes something like this

It was jsut another story written on the second page underneath the tigers football score. It said he was only eighteen a boy about my age. they found him face down on his bedroom floor

"event","Ok i have alot to say. First i want to say that i love noelle and im very sorry that your hurt, but another thing about the Livejournals. Im so tired of peoples annonymous comments trashing other people. Im not saying i never have because i think everyone is guilty of it at one point. But i try as hard as i can to tell the person i have a problem with my problem because that way gossip and crap doesnt start. Also trying to fix everything or trashing some one to make someone else feel better doesnt always make you feel better it sometimes takes time. I love all of you and you guys are so supportive but sometimes you just have to let things run their course
<3 ALWAYS 
ASHLEY LYNN

P.S. Taz i love you so much!"

"event","Wow yesterday i had like the worst day ever. As soon as i got home from school my mom told me i had to work and that my plans were ruined. Then i got to work and got yelled at on the phone by someone i had no idea who he was, then he came in and threatened me (over a stupid pizza??) Then my brothers put anchovies in my soda(eww!!im terrified of them!!) Then this girl lied so she got to leave b4 me then on my way inside my house i fell and spilled my drink everywhere( im such a dork!!) then when i got inside i set my food down to get the phone and my dog ate it!!!! But the end of the day was great!  And now i feel so much better. Except i dont really get to do anything this weekend which sucks because i had to get my horse washed and clipped and everything (ill tell you about his bath in a minute) And tommorrow i get to wake up at like 4:30 and go to a horse show all day!! 
Oh ya about the bath!!
Being that my horse is retarded when ever i give himm a bath i end up getting more wet then he does. And it was so cold and i got all wet and dirty!! but it was fun!!

"event","so im getting married and running away to barcelona:) great huh!anyways......ive been thinking some more and im pretty sure that i have no clue. Im really confused right now and unsure of what im going to do but ill figure it out sometime.Its just that whatever i do in any case people are going to get hurt. Its not easy when your dealing with other peoples feelings not to mention your own. I realize that no one can help me on this and i have to figure it out myself but it feels good just to get it off my chest. Well im off to do alot more thinking.........

"event","ive actually been thinking alot lately...... and i have noticed how glad i am to have the friends that i do.  The ""popular"" girls (i still <3 you guys) have fights and drama going on ALL the time. And right now it seems everyone is being shady and taking sides which is just dumb. But im not getting into that because i have my own shit to deal with. Anyways...i cant wait till school is over. It will suck that i wont get to see my friends alot but i will get to do alot of things i want to do and really clear my head. Also im going on vacation in the end of june so im excited about that too. More quotes from my journal....

*never leave the one you love for the one you like because the one you like will leave you for the one they love

*being able to love is good and being loved is better but you cant beat being loved by the one you love

*love isnt about finding the perfect person but learning to see and imperfect person perfectly

*no one falls in love by choice, its by chance
 no one stays in love by chance ,its by work
 no once falls out of love by  chance its by choice

* love isnt what makes the world go around but what makes the ride worth while"

I guess this time you're really leaving 
I heard your suitcase say goodbye 
And as my broken heart lies bleeding 
You say true love in suicide 

You say you're cried a thousand rivers 
And now you're swimming for the shore 
You left me drowning in my tears 
And you won't save me anymore 

Now I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl 

I'll be there for you 
These five words I swear to you 
When you breathe I want to be the air for you 
I'll be there for you 
I'd live and I'd die for you 
Steal the sun from the sky for you 
Words can't say what a love can do 
I'll be there for you 

I know you know we're had some good times 
How they have their own hiding place 
I can promise you tomorrow 
But I can't buy back yesterday 

And Baby you know my hands are dirty 
But I wanted to be your valentine 
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby 
When you get drink, I'll be the wine 

I'll be there for you 
These five words I swear to you 
When you breathe I want to be the air for you 
I'll be there for you 
I'd live and I'd die for you 
Steal the sun from the sky for you 
Words can't say what a love can do 
I'll be there for you 

Solo 

And I wan't there when you were happy 
I wasn't there when you were down 
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby 
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out 

I'll be there for you 
These five words I swear to you 
When you breathe I want to be the air for you 
I'll be there for you 
I'd live and I'd die for you 
Steal the sun from the sky for you 
Words can't say what a love can do

I wish some one loved me and cared for me like that, or calling me back would work too!"

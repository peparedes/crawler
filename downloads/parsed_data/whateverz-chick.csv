"event","today it seemed like i had a good day except that i had to wake up at 5 am . since im an explorer and i dint do my fucking hours i had to go as a recruit and workout from 7 2 10. that shit was hard, at one point i almost fucking threw up and at another point i almost funking fainted. at another point we had just finished running and and my arms were killing me cuz we had been doing pushups before, anyways yea they told us to get down and do pushups on the grass, well as i got down my arms were fucking weak so i couldnt hold my wait at all, i swear i just put my arms on the grass and they just fucking sliped and i ended up falling right on my face, dam that hurted like a bitch. later on they told us to lie down  next to each other leaving space in between us. we were suppose to jump over the people and get to the other side and lay back down. when it was my turn i started jumping and all it was going good until i reached the third person his fucking fuck ass moved his legs and i fucking tripped. i tried to get my balance but that dint work cuz i was stepping on other people until i just fucking fell on the dam sement. that shit hurted. it fucking left some bruses and a few cut...

"event","So I had to write a poem for class and forgot about it until the day before and then when I got it back I found out I got an A for it. Here it is:

The Gate



The gate for many things,
Family and fun all take part.
Some events that occur may be flings,
Some people look at it as art.
To some it is scary and mystifying,
To others it is called home at night.
To strangers it can be tantalizing,
To frineds it could be the reason for a fight.
It suffers much pain to be so beautiful,
The cotton is its monthly companion.
I see it as a glistening jewel,
But a lot of the time I get none.
God gave women this precious gift,
Something so strong, it could make the world shift.



the only question she asked was if I'd seen the vagina monolouges. thank you vaginas, for being my poetic inspiration."

but today I watched a movie that helped a lot. it's called wedding daze and it was stupid and funny but it helped a lot. I'm not sure why but it made me feel better about my self. I'm still not happy with myself and a lot of people and my self esteem is at an all time low, but for the next few hours i'll be happy. after that i'm sure i'll sink back down though.

I'm just really tired of a lot of the things going on in my life and wish that people would open up there fucking eyes to what their doing, it's childish."

"event","so i went to louisville this weekend to audition for big brother, i stood in line for five and a half hours waiting to go in and do the thing, I was extremely nervous. Chris Bianchi was behind me too and we talked a little but it was more wierd that we were two people away from each other in line haha. They were doing one on one interviews for a long time and it was taking a long time so finally they went to three at a time and then when my portion came in and there was still about 500 people to go after me they started doing five at a time.

if they asked a lot of questions and took your picture that meant that they liked you, but since they did group interviews they took the group picture if they liked at least one of you.

my group consisted of this older woman who wore too much make up and was overly christian, a really quite weird looking guy who just kept answering things with ""well, i'm in sales"" or other ways of saying that he's got no life but working in sales. and then two drunk guys who were loud and annoying the whole time and the one next to me kept interupting me and the others during her asking questions.

I was frazzled the whole time too trying to think what my answer would be to the questions before it got to me, wishing that i was doing a one on one, but then half way through she looked dead on me and smiled and asked ""so you know about the thing were you have to be in great physical, mental, and psychological health right?"" she kept her eyes on me and i said ""yeah"", she never once looked at anyone else, she just smiled back at me with a reassuruing nod, i think that was the ""i want you"" (not in the sexual way but in the you would be good way, but she was hot so either one works haha) and then she focused a few more questions on me and then she asked to take our pictures. 

now all i wait on is a call from CBS to see if i make it to the next round of interviews. i'm praying I get it. even to be called back for a second interview would be truly exciting for me for real.

Thunder on the other hand kind of sucked, i don't want to type it out but it consisted of me getting lost at thunder thinking i would have to sleep on the street, me walking 15 or more total miles that entire day, Sara making me go to some weird party where i drank wine out of a box, me not sleeping but maybe 3 hours at her house while she was spending the night with Gress who i guess made her come back to his house because he was afraid that i was going to fuck her, and it being cold the entire time.

today was good, i hung out with brandy most of the day and that was fun and then got olive garden with rick and chris and sam and josh for lunch. now i'm off to lay down for awhile.

much love from your future big brother star, Jonathon"

I stood there for a few minutes and sized him up. i figured i could take him if it came down to it. well he ended up making me take him down scottsville road past the high school, into a trailer park and down some more, i figured he was taking me somewhere to shoot me or something but then he just asked for 75 cents to make a phone call for someone to help fix his car in the morning. i pulled it out of my change thing and gave it to him and he kept thanking me.

He said he had been standing at walmart for two hours, people just walked by and ignored him, got rude with him, or laughed in his face, i mean what ever happened to human kindness? Yeah i figure some people are scared that he might of killed them but you know he was a tiny little man, what could he of done. I'm faster and stronger than him so i mean i think i was good."

i start driving to work and hit every red light between here and work, when i get there i work with abby, she's okay but she dosn't fucking talk. like i work for two hours straight of just silence, i try making conversation and it only last for like two minutes. then as soon as my boss gets there abby decides it's time to talk, like i havn't been trying to all day, and supposedly her husband is off of house arrest finally thats something that she keeps going on about.

my nose has been bleeding on and off all day, kind of weird, not a lot just like dabs. 

then i realized that it was past time for me to get off and i tried to get back to campus but damn Dr. Yambor's attendance thing, she locked the door on me as i was turning the corner, i was in MMTH and just yelled ""FUCK"" and walked down here to waste some time.

I don't feel good right now, my head hurts really bad, i think that might have something to do with the nose bleeds, kind of feel weird too like in my hand and legs. Maybe i just need a nap."

My dad told me that him and mom were spending the night somewhere else so of course we acted the fool as much as we could. I'm pretty sure with some facebook stalking you can find two or three pictures of me that i don't wish to be viewed. I've got permenate marker all over my body and well so does everyone else that was there. I got in a fight with Jared over the phone for two reasons but the biggest one is that he yelled at me because i told him we wern't driving to his house at two in the morning. fuck him!

Still yet to be kissed at midnight on New Years but oh well i hopefully have a few more left to get it. 

so as for the subject of this entry. caitlin and brit tied rick to my little sisters bed and beth was doing something somewhere and tyler was wandering around the house aimlessly and me and carla were upstairs on the couch when my parents walked in at about three in the morning. of course i jump up pretend to be sober and straighten my apperence a little. rick is still tied to the bed with caitlin and brit and my dad decides that he wants to go check on everyone so that called for some explination plus all the empty bottles of vodka and other stuff. everyone was pretty drunk but carla so she used her charm on my dad to get us out of a lot of trouble. we then went down stairs and played a game of disney trivia after i took rick to the spare bedroom to pass out. then we all went to bed. a good night to say the least. I did get kicked in the nuts first thing in the morning but she felt bad about it and really thats all i could of hoped for. 

hope everyone had a good new year and that your breaks going well. you guys should call me sometime.

I'm starting to appreciate my other friends here at home other than Tyler and Jared, who have become complete bastards as of late. 

tonight is family stuff and then making a trip to Lancaster to blow some stuff up, cause we all know how much i love that. hopefully no one will get hurt but knowing me you can probably expect my next entry to read ""i just got released from the hospital with 2nd degree burns"" hopefully not though. 

I hope that everyone is having a good break and that everyone is safe. If I don't talk to anyone before than have a merry Christmas, happy holidays, happy new year, happy kwanza or whatever you celebrate.

two nights ago i was sitting at my house working on a puzzle saying to myself ""tonight is going to suck"" then caminisch calls me and says that she wants to do something with the gang, so i call around and tyler, jared, caitlin, caminisch, and carla come over. i guessed that they were all going to leave after the movie went off but then we played poker and then we just sat around and talked for ever then we packed six people into jared car, i had to lay across people in the back seat which was a bad idea, and we drove to danville at 4 in the morning to eat at arbys. then we came back to my house i figured that they would leave then, but no we pulled out the twister board. i kicked ass on the second round and won. 

we then saw this commercial for a thing were if your depressed you go to the bahamas. it may have been the cheesiest commercial we have ever seen, so what do we do? we call the number and tyler pretends to be palistinian or whatever and this guy and tyler get into this fight and the guy on the phone said this before hanging up ""do you want to go to the bahamas or the fucking al queda you dirty mother fucker?"" thing was that this guy was really arabic or whatever.

just about everyone left halfway through the grudge when my dad needed out of the driveway. they thought i was crazy for not going to sleep until about 10 but whatever.

this break i think is going to kill me but there are some things that i am looking forward to. hopefully my prayers will be answered and somethings will turn around for me but the job hunting isn't going very well, i think i may just have to move back to BG early and just work at Cosmos while i rot away in BG by myself.

now off to check my grades, i know i got through my gerentology and poli. sci. class good but those arnt the ones i'm worried about."

"event","stayed up real late last night only to get two hours of sleep in before work, then finding out that today was my last day there, i'm leaving during the day so that i don't get in trouble for only having one headlight now. I think that there have been more injuries than i thought over the wreck, my ribs kind of hurt and i'm in a lot of pain still with my back and neck. maybe the doctor would of been a good idea.

to clear up the Me too statement made in the last entry that has to do with my mom and dad and sister. My mom and dad are yelling at me because of how poor they are and my little sister is turning into my older sister, this is the part about the making the right decisions, as much as i say i don't like jessica i am her older brother and will take care of her. she's getting into drugs and she's fighting more and more with my parents, she's planning on moving out and living with her boyfriend. bad idea. I don't know what to do about it and it's starting to worry me.

i think i did pretty good on my poli. sci. final today, only music and bowling left, music tonight and bowling first thing in the morning. I may leave tomorrow instead of saturday i'm not sure.

My friend Jared bought a gun, I don't know how i feel about this.

arch nemisis' are everywhere now, i saw one last night, there is a good chance i'll see one as soon as i get home and another sometime over the christmas break. i hate having more than one like most people but then again i guess it just makes me more like a super hero."

"event","Today i got up at 6:30 and got ready for work. 
I get to work and everything is normal.
We work as normal getting everything done and joking around.
I start making jokes a little after 8.
We start talking about when I tasted the stuff no one knew what it was in the freezer.
I then say that I could eat anything because i'm just awesome like that.
they tell me I can't.
(no one should tell me I can't)
they pull out the ground cinnamon.
they get a spoon full out of it.
I take the spoon FULL in my hand.
I put the entire spoon full in my mouth.

now little did i know that a spoon full of ground cinnamon makes a human stop breathing and induces vomitting at the same time within seconds of consumption. what cinnimon didn't go down into my lungs and throat came shooting out of my mouth like a dust cloud in probably the worst coughing session i have ever had. I then realized i couldn't breath and tried to drink water but there was no room in mouth really to fit any water. i then started freaking out and opened my mouth as wide as i could and put my head under the faucet. then i grabbed a cup of water and chugged it as fast as i could. i still couldn't breath the only thing i could think to do was chug more water while my co-workers just stood there with their mouth open scared that i was going to die, except for the girl who gave me the spoon who was laughing at my failed attempt to live at this moment. Then it hit me that the cinnamon was ready to come back out and I had a repeat from the other night but this time it was in a toilet so no clothing got thrown away this time. I then drank some milk after i was told that that would help and it did but i really don't think i will be able to eat cinnamon for like a year now. 

to sum this morning up: A: I'm a fucking dumbass B: i got most of the cinnamon down. FACE!"

"event","so i would like to point out before i type this that i was having a great day. In tv production i mastered the editting software i editted a whole commercial pretty much in like ten minutes, well my parts anyway and then poli. sci. was good, and i'm still in a good mood about last night.

okay on to the point, I was walking back to Rodes from poli. sci. class and i turned this corner and here comes this guy with a little cap on a red and white stripped polo shirt tucked into his kakhi shorts wearing flip flops, this guy also because of the cold weather was turning blue and he was fat so he looked like that little girl from charlie and the chocolate factory when she ate the thing to turn blue, and his mouth was in a way a baby goes after a bottle, all in all he just looked stupid.

so what is the first thing that comes to my mind. I just wanted to punch him in the face, i had the most uncontrollable urge to just deck this guy. I actually stopped for a second and weighed the pros and cons of knocking this guys nose into the back of his brain. I didn't do anything i just kept walking but it sort of bothered me that i considered beating this persons ass in the middle of campus just because he looks stupid.

Oh well i then started going up to other people to see if i was just in a fighting mood but no one else invoked such a frenzy of hate. hopefully i never see this guy again. oh son of tom o'leary i'm gong insane!"

also i've almost completed my costume for halloween, i'm dressing up as a superhero and I must say that i look damn good in the spandex that i bought last night. off to NADS today to buy a speedo.

"event","so yeah i invited everyone on my friends list to join GENITALIA on facebook yesterday. the group reached 60 members in less than 12 hours from my friends list and my friend tyler G's friends list. well tyler is friends with a guy by the name of chris gooch. in high school chris didn't like me. i tried to be nice to him for a while but he hated everything about me and no one knew why. on his facebook he has a list of 5 people that he hates and the reasons why. they are all people from my high school and we don't know really why he hates us. 

to the point, he joins the group yelling about how we stole the GENITALIA joke from him, when in all reality me and tyler and chris and kyle all came up with it as well as TITS (teens into techniqil stuff) and PENIS (people expressing new Ideas selectivly) so he goes on a rant about how i'm a smarmy asshole, cataclismicly(or what ever) not funny. and then he tells everyone to burn in hell for all eternity and that he hates us all. so another guy that i don't know posted and started in on chris which made me happy. then i gave a little rant about the bastard and now there are a hand full of others that have lended a FUCK YOU to chris. If you would like to show your support to the FUCK YOU CHRIS cause on facebook go join GENITALIA right now."

"event","ok so i had a pretty interesting week off from school. after i watched my highschool do a performance of fiddler on the roof i organized a party at kyles house without him knowing (that's what he gets for telling me that his parents are out of town) we did a lot of fun things the one biggest thing is that for high school graduation tristan made a little scrap book and stuff and put it in a box that looked like a graduation cap and it was really cute well i decided it was time for it to go! i filled the box full of axe spray cans and then me and chris took more cans of it and sprayed the box down on the outside. then we shot bottle rockets at it didn't work so i had chris cause a destraction so that i could sneak some of kyles gasoline out of his garage and i poured it on the box and made a trail out of it and lit it. the axe cans exploded and sent stuff flying everywhere. 

after we cleaned up the mess me and chris made bubble wrap jump suits and started riding bikes then when they were patching up my jumpsuit with duct tape they tied me up with it and threw me in the truck of Rebecca's car. they drove me to food lion but i managed to get out and when kyle opened the trunk i attacked him. then we went back to kyles house and i didn't know it at the time but i put on a WW1 uniform i just thought it was a jacket and came down stairs and kyle told me someone died in it and i freaked out me and chris then changed into some funny clothes and went to walmart and goofed off. then we went back to kyles house and played ""i've never"" it got pretty boring so me and rebecca started talking about Lambert who's in the navy now and the stuff thats going on with that. then we went to kyles room and talked about it till 4 o'clock and when we came back down everyone was asleep. i left and went home. all in all i had a good week but part of me wishes that i went to florida with those guys like i was invited to do in the first place."

"event","ok so last night me tyler and chris went and got christmas lights and extension cords, we dressed in black and went to kyles house. we wrapped his truck in christmas lights and ran back to the car and called his and screamed ""marry christmas!!"" him and his family thought it was funny as hell. we then started taking pictures wrapped up in lights and then when it was kyles turn we tied him up really tight with the lights so he couldn't get out and then left him for a few minutes that was the third time we pulled pranks on him that day. the first time we stole his tale gate and had a major chase scene through lincoln county! oh i miss those guys, my parents also told me that if i get arrested during spring break that i have to stay in jail until saturday night so i'm always making sure my shoes are tied before i do stupid shit so that i can run away.

also i just got back from my friend jessica's house and she told me that i was the ""bad"" friend, and everyone agreed. when they say bad friend they mean that i'm the one that dosn't care about getting in trouble and i say whats on my mind, i guess the bad influence. i don't think im that bad but i guess compaired to my friends i am.

Tyler: did you know that the walrus has the biggest penis of all mammals?
Brittney house: oh really, wow, what has the biggest?
Tyler: Jonathon, duh!
Brittneay house: I don't know how you now that!
Me: cause you told him bitch! and you loved ALL of it haha!"

"event","ok so i have to stay in Bowling Green until 6 am. sunday morning because of my radio shift right, well i worked someone elses too from 10 am to 1 pm so that i would have something to do. after that i took the fish (fiddy and jannice) out to eat, well really i went to McDonalds and they sat at the table eating their fish food while i ate. anyway i then just sat in my car with the windows rolled down and the fish sitting beside me reading more of my ""nine stories"" book. I then talked on the phone for a while with tyler and my mom and dad, then i decided that i should just leave the fish in the radio station under the supervision of my fellow djs. i havn't checked on them since so i better go do that after i get off of here. im sitting in mmth using the computer because i have nothing better to do. 

good news jenni nethers burned me a copy of the RENT soundtrack so i've been jamming out to that for the past two days now.

oh and some scary stuff. last night at the motel i layed down to take a nap at 6 o'clock and then tyler and chris called me to talk to me about something i forget and after i got off the phone with them, and i mean the second that i pushed the off button on the phon, the room phone rang, i picked it up and all i heard was someone breathing, i said hello for a long time and the breathing continued. this scared the shit out of me so i grabbed my keys and decided that it was time for a drive. i then came back to the room about one in the morning and checked everything making sure that no one was in there. i then locked the door and went to bed about the time i started dozing off i heard banging on the walls and someone screaming ""I'm going to kill you!"" i looked out the peep-hole and there was man at the door! but then a woman came up to him and then i relized that he was drunk and talking to her and then his friends took him back to the room i didn't fall asleep for a couple hours out of pure fear. but i could of taken him if he tried something lol, he was a like 40 year old man about 5'3"" no meat on him except for his beer belly. 

oh well time to go charge my phone and hang out at the revolution studios until i go see ""V for Vendetta"" i heard it was excellent. peace out people and be safe during spring break!"

"event","okay so i have every reason in the world to be happy right, I've got awesome friends, my family seem to be treating me much better, I got a girl that knows how to treat me finally, and lots of other things, but everyday i seem to be getting more and more depressed. I find myself telling me to smile or say something funny, when in all reality i just want to go to my room and curl up in the corner by myself. i'm not happy, i have to work somethings out in my life. the thing is that i don't know what i need to work out. spring break will be good for me i think. i've got a few plans, going to the school to teach the broadcasting classes (because they hired a dumbass that dosn't know how to put a tape in a VCR), going to Lexington to visit some people, going to Georgetown to see some people, hanging out with my friends, visitng family, and the best part, being at home for a whole week with out worrying about anything. oh and i also get to babysit fiddy and Jannice (alicia's fish because she can't take them on the plane)

I also feel very guilty about something that i'm doing, i'm not saying what it is but it involves a hand full of people that i really care about and i just feel like shit, i should come clean but i can't and i don't know how. oh well i will figure it out eventually."

"event","ok, so life has been going pretty great right now. everything just seems to be going right you know. but i've had a lot of things on my mind. like i'm not sure if I enjoy being here, and when i say here i don't mean WKU, i mean like on the planet you know. some times i just want to end it and the thing that scares me the most is that I don't feel like anythings holding me back. I sometimes want to live on the edge and just go. not worry about consequences and just do what ever but then i think of my friends, some times i act stupid and i feel like i'm pushing friends away by acting this way but the thing is that they have never seen me this way, this is the way I act, all they saw last semester was me being bossed around by Tristan, acting like I was some sort of scared child. but in all reality this is me, i act stupid, sometimes i do so much stuff that i tends not to make sense. 

also, some of my friends here i have gotten to know pretty well. Micheal Puckett is one of the coolest guys i've ever met, Jenni Allison is the sweetest girl in the world, Cyndi Johnson is like she would put it ""the cat's pajama's"", Tyler Roberts is hilarious, Alicia Barker is so freaking cute and awesome to hang out with. these are just some of the people i've gotten to know even better this semester and i'm happy to call them some of my best friends.

Even with all of this, I feel that my depression is coming back, I suffered for almost two years and it got pretty bad, the last thing that i want is to end up in the hospital again. I don't know if i can control it on my own this time, last time i went through it i just told myself to get over it and after about two years i did, i don't know if i can do it again, i hurt myself and everyone around me. If i hurt anyone in any way let me know."

"event","I really don't know why but for some odd reason, i'm not mentioning any names, people that shouldn't be are reading my live journals. I don't know how to make this thing friends only but if your going to get mad about what i put in my LJ, then don't read it! I keep hearing shit about ""why did you write that"" or unwanted aim messages about what i write in my LJ. the people that i'm talking about know who they are! the only people that are my friends on here are Micheal, Cyndi, Laura, and Cat. those people have been posting comments and thats fine I love you guys and wish to keep hearing from you. but there are some people that get mad at these little details. well i'm sure that i'll be getting a few im's from these unwanted people about this entry as well. so i only have one thing to fucking say! 

This is a fucking journal, this is where i write the things down that are going on in my head. when i start typing i don't really notice what i'm typing until i look at it later. if you get upset at anything that i say shove it up your ass! this is my fucking LJ and i can write any god damn thing in it I want, got it!?!"

"event","ok so red bull and vodka didn't kill me but it did make me do some stupid shit. after we drank a lot of vodka we got kyle to drive us to Pizza Hut and since his truck could only hold three people me and chris rode in the back and it was so fucking cold. I got kicked the face by kyle and it still hurts like a bitch. I was at pizza hut and i decided i was going to eat some pepperoni. It didn't make me sick so i was happy. I'm thinking about going back to chicken.
It was easy being a vegitarian when i was eating a majority of all my meals with another vegitarian. I figure that if only eat chicken i can still eat pretty healthy. i'm still going to stay on a lot of vegitables and stuff but i will eat chicken maybe one or two times a week. 
I had a lot of vodka last night and it was so fucking good. i mixed this awesome drink with hiwian punch, this sour mix stuff, some apple martini mix, vodka, and some other shit. it was great. I didn't get much sleep and thats probably a bad thing because i have to work at revolution from 3-6 tonight after getting back from a party somewhere on campus.
And i finally asked Alicia to be my girlfriend and she said yes! it was so funny when everyone of my friends were like ""You did so much better! She's awesome"" this is not to offend anyone that likes Tristan ok. My friends hated her and she hated them too so it's fine. any way tyler told me ""You have my approvale, because you didn't have my approval with the last one and look what happened"" so anyway i'm happy and everythings awesome!"

"event","ok, the subject was one of the things that Carlos Mencia said last night. so fucking hilarious. I almost pissed myself, my sides and face we're hurting for laughing so hard. He had an opening act. if you saw the show where he did the ""dee dee dee"" awards, the guy with cyrebral palsey was the opening act. he was hilarious as hell too. me and alicia sat in the third row and it was great.
Valentines day was fun too. went and got some of Alicia's favorite candy for her, then i had the survivior thing which really pissed me off when we lost both things, but i've got plans for winning anyway. then me and alicia just hungout and watched tv. it was great.
A web site told me yesterday that a red bull and vodka can kill you! this weekend is my vodka weekend and i'm still going to drink it though. so if you guys don't hear from me on like sunday i probably died. something about the being drunk and then the speed you get from the red bull either gives you a heart attack, but if that doesn't happen you usually do somthing really stupid and die from that. 

I love my clove cigs!"

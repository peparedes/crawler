Just thought I'd exhibit just how shallow I can really be.... lol, anyway...  I finally got a bundle of feathers off a Kithless Siralunn!  I'm gonna post a picture of it here as soon as get it uploaded.  ^_^  Heres how the feathers work...  if you find some on a dead Kithless you can turn in ONE bundle for a funky feather hat, or FIVE bundles for a sweetass flowing red kithless dress!  Feathers are a rare drop item...  so after fighting about 50 kithless I finally got my first bundle....  which I took to the crafter and got my very own funky feather hat! :o)

"event","Hey hey...

I just thought I'd bounce this at some people and see what you think.  For years I've wanted to start an organization that would help break down the sterotypes and empower people to take personal action...  basically to better themselves and the world around them.  We have lots of organizations on campus that have similar goals, like STAR, Common Ground, and the ISU to some extent...  but I wanted to see about starting an on campus organization that would promote spiritual and cultural unity across the board.

The name of the group would be called LOVEPEACE or Lovepeace International.  I know, the name sounds a little cheesy and like all hippie flower power-like....  I don't care, I like it and I think it would have more universal appeal because the name says it all (and its more direct and simple).  The mission would be to empower people to take positive action in their personal daily lives, to educate the community about world cultures, religions, and peoples.  The group would encourage people to better themselves by challenging their ideas about race and spirituality.  We would promote acceptance of all peoples, cultures, and religions.... rather than toleration.  Why?  Cause the the very concept of toleration implies that the person is doing it grudgingly and that they still harbor a deep distrust or hate within themselves.  And so...  Racial and spiritual acceptance is alot more positive (though challenging) than mere toleration.

If I get enough people that are interested in this...  I'd like to start it as an on campus group in the fall, and if all goes well...  promote it as a model for communities in several areas as well as launch some global web-based support.

Some of the ideas/projects that the group could enspouse could include:

S.P.E.A.C - Stop Predjudice through Education and Awareness in your Community (inner city outreach program)
State sponsored daycare - for low income families and to help foster interracial friendships as well as stop fear or other races/cultures at an early age
Race Mentoring - giving young people support and encouragement from someone outside their immediate ethnic group.

The spiritual aspect of the group.... though I don't want to abandon it, maybe a little more complicated.  My idea was basically to have something like a unitarian church service offered....  where the members all agree to respect and be openminded about worship and belief systems.  Its possible that each service can be different as far as the spiritual vehicle one takes to get to your higher power (God, Allah, Ahura Mazda, Kami, or whatever).  Because people are willing to die for thier religious beliefs....  promoting acceptance is a dangerous prospect, but regardess...  I feel its important aspect to address in order to open up peoples minds and hearts.  The main thing and most challenging thing will be to create a worship/education model that is non-threatening and simple.  But then again, if we just put the invitation and information out there.... and if people come on their own free will and understand the objective...  maybe theres hope.

Anyway, this has been on my mind forever.... so I thought I would finally break down and share my thoughts.  If your up to it, please give me some feedback or ideas.... if not its cool too.  ^_^"

Just a quick reminder...  its actually tommorrow(Thurs) for the PAINFREE HIV testing, on campus from like 10-3pm.  Hope to see ya there!  ^_^

I hardly got any sleep last night....  got up around 2:30am to check my AIM *swirly eyes*, then I got sucked into Asherons Call and played till I had to go to work this morning....  *yawns*  O_o!  Hummmm...  actually 11-2:30 is pretty generous for sleep! ^_~  And I did level up my character to 36, died 3 times....  once by a Kirthless Siraluun, twice by Mosswart Zealots.  So much has changed in the game....  I haven't played in like a year, since then they added new housing (apartments... I wanna get one!), a ton of new monsters, portals, and weopons, and they changed the way you learn magic!

*more swirly eyes* O_o"

I just heard on NPR that they passed a law that will make it completely legal to eat Roadkill.  Now doesn't that sound appetizin?  ^_^  Yeah, previously it was only legal for the person who hit the deer or possum to take it home fer dinner....  (mmmmm, now thats good eatin!) but now its legal for anyone to scrape their vittles off the side of the road.  *hehe* oy....  I think I'm gonna be sick.

On the lighter side, I took my car into CarX cause the AC was leakin.... first time they said they just needed to replace the seals/gaskets...  a very inexpensive proposition, but this morning while checkin it over they found a huge gapping hole in my condenseor ($500.00 plus labor!)  ~_~'  Oh well, looks like I'll just be hot for a while...."

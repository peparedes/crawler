What I don't understand is how Sgt. Osborne gets to the airport in like, 10 minutes.  I'm pretty sure he mentions being stationed at Lackland AFB, and there's no way (even in the 80s!) he could get to SAT from Lackland in 10 minutes.  Randolph AFB, I could see...maybe even Brooks AFB (straight shot up 37/281, but tricky curves around the Stadium Drive and Hildebrand exits) but if he was at Lackland AFB or Kelly AFB, there's no way he could make it."

more ramblings:  Maybe more people would buy albums in CD form if they weren't such a pain in the ass to open.  I picked up this random 3-CD set of blues earlier...quality assurance would be a start too, as the liner notes explains that where noted, a ""*"" indicates the original recordings, and the rest are new recordings by the original artist.  However, there is no ""*"" next to any of the Lead Belly songs.  I'm pretty sure they didn't get new recordings from Lead Belly, as he's been dead for about 60 years.  As I go through ripping and editing these songs into mp3s, they all sound like original recordings to me...which is perfectly fine.

oh yeah, and I scrolled through 46 pages of friends' posts (sorry.  I haven't read them in a while.  I'm a jerk like that.) and not ONE FUCKING post from pirate_arr and it's talk like a pirate day.  I am not pleased.

and am I weird for wanting to go see a double feature this weekend, if the 2 movies featured are Jackass 2 and the one about Huey P. Long?  if you had to masturbate while watching either of those movies, which would you masturbate during?  and I only ask because of this complex algorithm I apply to things."

She was such a bad ass, too.

I had forgotten about this gem from her...the AP article on Yahoo mentioned it..

Asked once what she might have done differently had she known she was going to be a one-term governor, Richards grinned.

""Oh, I would probably have raised more hell."""

"event","I had a dream last night that Fred LeBlanc of Cowboy Mouth was on RockStar: Supernova.

He had to have a seperate segment all to himself because they let him perform with his own drumkit.  During the cutaways, Tommy Lee looked scared because he knew Fred was a better drummer than he is.  And Fred performed Cowboy Mouth songs in his usual concert gear...which is generally a t-shirt with the sleeves torn off, windshorts, and barefoot.

Yeah.  These are the dreams I have lately."

Other than that, it was a great weekend.  I got to hang out with people I dig, and got to see some people I wasn't expecting to...that was an awesome surprise.  I also wasn't confronted by anyone I did not want to see.  That was good too."

I rate this one a hearty chucklesnort...

Three econometricians went out hunting, and came across a large deer. The first econometrician fired, but missed, by a meter to the left. The second econometrician fired, but also missed, by a meter to the right. The third econometrician didn't fire, but shouted in triumph, ""We got it! We got it!""


This one got a full on guffaw from me...

An economic forecaster was known to have an horseshoe prominently displayed above the door frame of his office. Asked what it was for, he replied that it was a good luck charm that helped his forecasts. But do you believe in that superstition? he was asked, and he said, ""Of course not!"" But then why do you keep it? ""Well,"" he said, ""it works whether you believe in it or not.""


This one's always a classic...

An economics professor and a student were strolling through the campus.  ""Look,"" the student cried, ""there's a $100 bill on the path!""  ""No, you are mistaken,"" the professor replied. ""That cannot be. If there were actually a $100 bill, someone would have picked it up."" 


But this one is my all time favorite economics joke...there's a bunch of variations of this...

A physicist, chemist, and an economist are trapped on a desert island...they've had nothing to eat for days and one day while searching, they find a cache of canned goods.  They all celebrate with joy till they realize they still can't get at the food.  The physicist says, ""if we smash the cans against this rock at the right velocity, the contents will spill out.""  The chemist says, ""And if we make a fire, the contents will be edible.""  The economist says, ""First, we must  assume we have a can opener..."""

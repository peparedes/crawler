"event","whoever the mother fucker was who decided that kids should be dragged out of bed at 7 in the morning in the middle of the fucking summer to go to school should be tracked down and savagly beaten. then i come home pass out on the couch, and wake up with a charley horse in my leg. it feels like every muscle in my leg just ripped out of place, spun around, then re-attached. i have work every single day this week, except today. Then i get to get up in the morning at 7 am..again, probably hung over....again. then work...again. it never ends...why?"

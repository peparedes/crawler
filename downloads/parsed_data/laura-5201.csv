Well, it's weird when you come to Oakville honestly, it's fun but at the same time you have that hint of pain, that you don't really talk to these people anymore. It's weird how like everyone at St. Thomas is soo amazingly close but I look at my other friends from here and we're falling apart. I know you have to move on etc.. etc.. but why do people find the need to sit you down and tell you that. I mean.. who honestly has a conversation about ""I don't see you in my life in 2 years"" Okay? You didn't have to tell me.. I kinda always assumed that. But now it's progressively begun awarkd and horribly painful. I've actually never been told before that someone is not comfortable with me, or does not want to be my friend. (I have been told to drown in my own blood etc;) lol..) but when it something coming from someone who use to be a close friend. and then they wouldn't even call you back when they say they want to talk to you. How stupid is that? I thought i was done and okay with it, but last night when i was out with the group (Minus this certain person) I got really upset (we were talkin about it) and i just started to lose it again.. like i have a good time with those people, but there is like a collective viewing slowly that it's not worth it. I'm attempting to multi-task so this may not make sense. But deal with it. lol.. WELL overall. it's been a good year except for that shit. I can't wait for tonight a little St.Thomas time.. it's awesome. and RYAN is home!!! YAY! Ryan! lol. Okay on that note, i must leave to u know get ready/change i have nothing left to type. I will update later,

"event","Hello All,

Well... school has begun and work has started, not that much because lets be honest I am in Sport Management but it will begin and trust me, SPMA isn't as easy as i make it out to be. Just the beginning is. I'm REALLY REALLY busy which I think is good for me. I need to be busy or i would kill someone/something/ruin my life. lol. 

I've discovered that a LOT of people have blogs, that's abit insane. But u know kinda of interesting. I don't really write anything to personal in mine, maybe i should? I don't know. Maybe I will start slowly and you know give a little bit of personal and then alittle bit of not. Wow, my blog must really suck to read. lol..

New Goal: Make blog more interesting.=More exposure. I will aim to achieve this

Well grey's anatomy time!!!! I will talk to u later,

"event","Well this week has been fun, entertaining and educational. It's a long drawn out story that leaves me sad on Saturday when the professional Scottish Football team abandons us. But it's been again fun and educational. I'm at work right now and bored outta my head... i'm getting sick of the OSC can't wait until i get to go back to school... even though school holds alot of busyness, it will be better than wroking full-time.
Pyza is having a party tonight on a side note, not sure if i can attend. but I will be trying to. 
Overall... Summer has been good.. not great but good, it woulda been great if i had enjoyedd my job a little more. lol.

But for now i must go back to work, and then leave to go on site!!!!!!! Hope everyone is doing good, and enjoying themselves!

Later Dayz,
Laura"

"event","Well.. Well.. I never finished the Ottawa Stories.. but that has kinda passed and i'm Lazy. All you need to know about Ottawa is sheer amazingness.. As per wasaga Beach 5 day trip. AMAZING as well.. 5 days off from work will always been amazing. I feel so much better, less stressed, less bitter, less WHITE! lol.. I HAVE A TAN muhahahahhaha! At wasaga, i read about 7 Books and sat on the beach listening to music and night i partook in drinking activities and had an overall good time. It was pretty awesome. Shotluck is my new favourite drinking game (kinda a game) basically it's liek a potluck cept everyone brings there favourite shot to the party! lol (enough for everyone) so basically you have 14 shots amazingness.. lol. On Wednesday when i returned i skipped the gym to attend Manchester Arms night, which wasn't bad besides me almost killing will for hitting me. The hate has grown increasingly! lol. BUT otherwise Manchester was fun, i went to OarHouse for a bit after with my friend Dani from Soccer, that was awesome.. Dave was the bartender that night so free shots were provided which was very nice of him. and i chilled with megan wisby and her brothers friends. Random yes.. fun OF COURSE! lol. Overall an awesome couple of days and should remain this way for awhile (or i hope!) lol. On that note, I must go back to doing the little work i do here.

Loveeeeee ya all,
Laura"

"event","Well again an attempt at a livejournal.. we'll see. i'm slacker so whose knows if it will last!!! lol. 

This summer has been alot of work, business and of course drinking. lol. I have had some amazing times thus far, Ashley's bday in Toronto, OTTAWA, Pints with the scots, just overall meeting a whole bunch of new people and hanging out with some old. 

But I think my CANADA DAY weekend was the best thing ever, and that is proven in everyone's LJ posts. lol. WOOOO.

Well, I will update more later. To lazy to write a good detailed entry"

"event","I caved, never really had one of these. so i've decided to make one. considering most ppl seem to have them and update relatively regularly, might as well use this to entertain me.
Well, this semestar has been anything but Calm. With stress being a major factor. Everything has been changing and way to fast for my liking. But i guess that's how life goes sometimes, fast and you don't really get a say in how it goes. 

No more time!!! LATER

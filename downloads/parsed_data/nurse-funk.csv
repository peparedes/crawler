"event","I absolutely hate it. I dread going and I'm constantly in fear of the grades of the classes I hate and didn't want to take. I feel like I've been a freshman in college for going on two years, and I will continue with this bullshit for another semester. I've never been so unhappy learning. I love avoiding the work because it's so dreadfully unsatisfying. I desperately want to transfer and start on track for a major that actually means something to me. I have such a problem with waiting but it looks like I'll have to do it for another semester. To make my problems worse I'm alone for the week and living in fear. I've missed every deadline possible this year for anyway out."

"event","I think I'll go ahead and use this time to make an entry. I'm currently stuck at the edible vibe, in franklin county, va dicking around for the next hour or so until daniel comes to find me. He's playing a show here tomorrow, and franklin county is the place where he did most of his growing up.

Oh by the way, have I talked about daniel at all? Well here's the whole schpeal o him. He's my new boyfriend as of...like late november. While I was living at my sisters apartment for a few months I was bored and lonely and didn't really have a lot of friends in richmond anymore. So I made a post on craigslist NOT looking for a boyfriend, but a guy with similar interests as me and wanted someone to chill and watch tv with that wasn't a total freak. Annndddd I found daniel, he replied to my post, actually about 110 different dudes replied, and I responded to like 3 of them, one of them being daniel. So we didn't really talk after the initial email back and forth for a few weeks after that and then he offered to take me out on a date to texas de brazil, a super fucking fancy restaurant and ended up spending a fuck ton of money on me. I thought afterward there was going to be like an obligated bj moment but there wasn't. He was genuine and adorable and tall and cute and hdduehsdjfghtyruwe. Yeah. That. So we hung out again after that and so on and here we are. Pretty much in love with this dude and I think he's probably the greatest boyfriend I've ever had. Scratch that, he is. I've never really had a boyfriend willing to do so much for me. He's great, he's a drummer in a band, and everyone knows I love musicians. Oh and he's actually a good musician, not like the last few musicians I've dated. I have yet to see any flaws that I haven't gotten over really quick. So here it is in march. After so long of really not discussing it here. I'm typing this on my sidekick trying to dick around for god knows how much longer. I really hope this one lasts a while. Because I really REALLY like this one. Oh and school, its going okay. Yeah whatever. Okay he's finally back. I'll try to update this thing more often."

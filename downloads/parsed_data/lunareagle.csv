"event","It's been really quiet lately. I guess finals are really taking a toll on us more than usual. Jr and MOMO left though. KOS-MOS and Ziggy haven't been very responsive either. 

The more things change the more they stay the same huh? <strike>I'm still alone here, probably even more so than at home at Second Miltia</strike>"

KOS-MOS just told me about the sparring match she's going to have, but I'm a little worried about it. She keeps assuring me that nothing serious will happen, but it's kinda hard for me to believe. Still I have no good reason to stop KOS-MOS from this so I said okay anyways. I'm going to be there, watching so if anything happens I can try to stop it. I just hope nothing bad happens...

Wow, that was embaressing. I can't believe Sakura had to carry both me and Yuber back to her dorm. Sorry about that and thank you so much. I'm not sure what happened, but I felt a little dizzy before I passed out. It's probably just overexertion."

"event","I really think the word that best summarizes everything is... oww. Why do I have a giant lump on the top of my head. <strike>It feels like KOS-MOS fell from the sky and hit me in the head.</strike> I don't really remember what happened... Well anyways I guess I better get back to classes."

"event","Wow! I haven't been at a University in ages. I was accepted into First Division so soon that I didn't stay too long at the last one. Well, it was due time that I got some more education anyways, and these past events have really showed me how unprepared I was for emergencies. So, here I am; ready to go off an improve my skills and knowledge! 

Oh um anyways, I have a roommated named ""Aerith"". I hope we can get to know each other because I haven't met her yet. Anyways, I gotta go and get ready. I entered kinda late and classes are starting soon."

"event","It has been a long weekend and it is going to be an even longer week because I won't be going to school.  The Mukwonago High School football team won the Division 1 championship so now we are state champions!  It is so great I love it.  I am so happy that I got to go to the game because it is a once in a lifetime experience.  Hey maybe they will go back again next year.  That would be totally cool."

"event","Well this wasn't the worst Mon. on the planet, but it wasn't the best either.  Band was probably the best part of my whole day today.  Then there was also AP Chem. it put a lot of work on me tonight.  But enough about Mon. lets talk about Fri.  On Fri. I got to go to the haunted corn maze with Caroline because she didn't have anyone else to go with and I was the only one avaliable not that I mind.  This was the first time I had ever driven in a car with Caroline and let me tell you people she is one hell of a crazy driver, but she did get us there safely.  I had a lot of fun.  Sat. I basically just lazed around all day.  And you know what happened Sun.  Anyways I had a lot of fun this weekend."

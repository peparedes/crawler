The social impact of the high incidence of birth defects due to teratogens is discussed in 
chapter 4. How can we reduce the number of offspring born to drug dependent 
mothers? If you had a grant for 100 million dollars to spend to help remedy this 
problem, what would you do? 

To get full credit for your answer to this essay, complete the following steps.
1) Define teratogen.
2) Select a specific teratogen from chapter 4 to discuss.
3) Explain how this particular teratogen that you have selected can affect the 
developing embryo and/or fetus.
4) Describe some of the characteristics and life situation of a woman who might be 
exposed to or use that particular teratogen during pregnancy.
5) Use some information from the text and your own ideas to describe a multiple factor 
program to help eliminate the problems caused by prenatal exposure to this teratogen 
and specify how much of the grant money you would use for each part of the program. 
Be sure to cite your secondary sources (the researchers name(s) (date) as cited in 
Papalia, Olds & Feldman, 2005) and to include a reference to your primary source (i.e., 
Papalia, Olds & Feldman, 2005) in APA style."

Explain how heredity and the environment work together to help shape human 
development. To answer this essay, complete the following steps.
 
1. Define phenotype and genotype and explain the difference between them (p. 67). 
 
2. Define reaction range and canalization and discuss how each of them can be used to 
explain how the environment can impact the potential expression of a hereditary trait  
(pp. 76-77).
 
3. Define genotype-environment and genotype-environment correlation. Discuss the 
three ways that genotype-environment correlation can strengthen the phenotype 
expression of a genotypic tendency and explain the difference between them (pp. 77-
78). 
 
4. Define niche-picking and give an example of how you have done this in your own life 
(p. 78).
 
5. Be sure to define all of the terms and discuss research evidence, as appropriate. Cite 
your secondary sources in APA style (e.g., Scarr, 1992, as cited in Papalia. Olds, and 
Feldman, 2004). Only provide a page number for direct quotes for correct APA style. 
Also be sure to provide a reference to your primary source, the text. (See the APA 
Style  Guide Tips on our course menu or go to the writing lab (online or in person) for 
help if needed.
 
Have a joyful week."

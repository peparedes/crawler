ZolaOnAOL: With you huh. OK, I will fight the system.
xCrimsonxMisfitx: ok! do you have a hammer?
ZolaOnAOL: That's an interesting question I don't hear everyday: Do I have a hammer. I have a whole lot of original answers.
xCrimsonxMisfitx: well, do you have a gun?
ZolaOnAOL: Interesting. No I do not need material possessions.
xCrimsonxMisfitx: ok...so HOw may i ask are we going to fight the system? with our minds?
ZolaOnAOL: You and your our minds.
xCrimsonxMisfitx: are we going to read them to death?

"event","All our times have come 
Here but now they're gone 
Seasons don't fear the reaper 
Nor do the wind the sun or the rain (we can be like they are) 
Come on baby (don't fear the reaper) 
Baby take my hand (don't fear the reaper) 
We'll be able to fly (don't fear the reaper) 
Baby I'm your man 
La-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la 

Valentine is done 
Here but now they're gone 
Romeo and Juliet 
Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet) 
40,000 men and women everyday (like Romeo and Juliet) 
40,000 men and women everyday (redefine happiness) 
Another 40,000 coming everyday (we can be like they are) 
Come on baby (don't fear the reaper) 
Baby take my hand (don't fear the reaper) 
We'll be able to fly (don't fear the reaper) 
Baby I'm your man 
La-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la 

Love of two is one 
Here but now they're gone 
Came the last night of sadness 
And it was clear she couldn't go on 
Then the door was open and the wind appeared 
The candles blew then disappeared 
The curtains flew then he appeared (saying don't be afraid) 
Come on baby (and she had no fear) 
And she ran to him (then they started to fly) 
They looked backward and said goodbye (she had become like they are) 
She had taken his hand (she had become like they are) 
Come on baby (don't fear the reaper)"

"event","Im still a bit pissed about today-my first day of ISS this year (regardless of shit I have said). I was doing good. Here is why I went there...in gym class, we have to change. If we dont-we sit out its that simple. However, we have a male coach. I guess he favors the girls, because, it dosent matter if THEY dont change. So, I got a group of the boys to rebel against the system (hooray for anarchy!) and not change until the girls were punished for it. I guess the dumb shit didnt get the point...because he asked ME (only me...out of 6 of us) WHY I DIDNT CHANGE? He said ""Do you think you are better than the rest of us?"" I simply replyed ""No, but apparently you think the girls are way better than me, as you would NEVER say anything to THEM"". He said ""that is a dirty lie the girls get the same exact treatment as the boys do!"".I had had it so, as I lost it I yelled ""Fuck you! You wouldnt know your ass from your dick""...and he made me go to ISS...rather-I walked out because I was about to get an assult charge. My favorite teacher Mrs.Culkin came to my rescue and questioned why I was there, I told my story to her and she said I should go talk to coach at the end of the period...well I did.I told him that the girls always got to play, even if they didnt change. He gave me some bullshit about how if they dont change for 3 times a semester, he sends them to ISS, everytime. I told him that he could bullshit me and call me crazy until he was blue in the face, but the other boys and I know whats going on, and we are not as stupid as we look. At that point I walked out again, as I was going to bust him in the face. The bastard with his authority...on a liter note...Im out. Im going swimming! Third time this season. I love swimming."

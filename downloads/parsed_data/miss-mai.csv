"event","Just watched a dvd ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", it is sad to see how some people ignores what they are doing, people getting duped so easily by lies and people that realizes that only when they lost one of THEIR family member.
 Would you really like to do something that someone asked you to do because he don't want to do it afraid of dieing? And don't forget that it is not for your ""family safety"" or for their ""freedom"" its just for his/their ""MONEY""..  
 In clear that means ""You should go to war because i don't want to die."" Think that what i just said is stupid? heh.. Then You should watch that movie first..  
 Have fun ;)"

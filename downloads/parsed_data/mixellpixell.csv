<marquee> tries to think of something to say in my retarded overrated, useless livejournal (why not talk about the summer?)</marquee>

Ok, well summer pretty much blew, it sucked, but not like the matrix sequel, or the lord of the rings movies, as in a 'I knew it was going to suck but expected to be half way decent' oh wait... that <b>IS</b> like the matrix sequel and the lord of the rings movies my bad! I spent most of the summer with sean which was good, ...very good haha, and me and sean spent, most of our time with Jay and Alex, we went to the beach, I <b>do not</b> like the beach. but sean was there so it was ok. except for jay and alex kicking sand and splashing each other and getting us non chalant kids wet and sandy in the process!! Not fun. actually i think that's the day where the picture on my icon is from! It's a really neat one!

Oh yeah, my  mom got drunk a lot this summer, well when i was home which was like 20% of my summer  [not that much ] she was pretty ugh, and because of this i've taken away all sean's drinking privlages when im around he was totally cool with it! he said he understood and sean doesn't drink much anyways, He didn't have like any parties this summer either, which was a lot easier on us, I'm not one for parties, especially after what happened to amy, last year, that's probably going to happen to my mom too, and i'm not going to be around to help her.

That <b>really really</b> worries me the most, that i'll be watching some show with sean about the ancient japanese samuri's on public broadcasting because it's raining outside and he doesn't want to get wet, so we're sitting inside and the phone will ring and something awful would happen!

I really shouldn't worry myself though, she's an adult she should be able to drink responsibly!

<b>ANYWAYS</b>
School was pretty fun, i have to say it once atleast! It was great to see everyone like craig and marco, and hazel and paige and jimmy. haha, they all looked healthy! 
they seemed pretty happy to be back at school though! well until mr.armstrong gave us a surprise pop quiz, I got an 91 and marco aced it, WITH bonus points! GRR. 

Who is calling my cell now!? it's like midnight! Ha ha well. yeah so that's it, No need to do a sign off since we're all aware of who i am."

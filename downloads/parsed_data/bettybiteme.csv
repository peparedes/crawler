"event","So, life is crazy, hectic and nutty.

Thursday night I got into an argument/fight with my brother and decided I wasn't going to deal with his BS any more. I started looking for a new place to live immediately. I found a good place recently, put down the deposit and I move in on the first.

I also decided that I'm going to try to sell my Rodeo so that I can get a beetle. (lower payments, lower insurance and I've always wanted a beetle anyway)

I was finally able to register for classes at Valencia. I will be taking...Intro to Early Childhood Ed., Intro to Humanities & Teaching Diverse Populations. 

Since I work for OCPS I don't have work this entire week because some schools are still being used as shelters and alot of people are still without power and also several streets are still blocked by fallen trees. It's crazy, the whole hurricane was crazy. Hurricane Charley sucked. It was the first hurricane that's actually done anything to Central Florida in my lifetime. Seeing gas lines Monday scared the shit out of me. I sat in line for at least 30 minutes waiting for gas. I started freaking out, I thought food supplies would run out as well and I didn't understand what the problem was exactly, whether it was because of the roads, the ports, or the electrical problems, but it seems that everything is coming along and eventually things will be the same again, for Central Florida anyway, certainly not for Punta Gorda. I'm just glad the other two hurricanes that are out there aren't coming this way, because after what happened the thought of another hurricane made me worry about everything.

Oh, my God, I thought about Iraq too during this whole ordeal. Those poor people have had their homes and cities destroyed and their friends and families killed. I thought at least what's going on here is from a natural disaster and it isn't an army attacking us and destroying our cities and homes. At least we can recover quickly. I hope Bush is taken out of office. Actually, I hope by the time my generation comes up that everyone in Congress and in the White House is different, actually thinking about what's important, but not giving out handouts on every corner like they do now and putting the responsibility of a child's education on the parent of the child. Kids fail because their parents don't do anything that they need to do. A teacher or a school can not make a child pass when a kid leaves at 2pm and gets no attention from then until 7am. It's irritating that out country wastes money on imprisoning people on drugs. If a person wants to kill themselves with drugs I say let them. Our homeland security is a joke. It really is, you ask them why they don't put the National Guard at the border to Mexico and they get defensive and say that they try to work with Mexico and Canada. Hello! If Mexico lets in terrorists and then doesn't stop illegal immigrants, what can happen? Think about it. On top of it all Bush is an idiot.

Wow, so, yeah, life has been crazy. September will be crazy too and October..."

"event","I had a very active imagination last night. 

I was out of town and in my dream that sort of meant in town, since my friends were there. I was with some acquaintances and attempted to buy a quarter bag of pot. I got the bag, met up with a friend of mine, Lesley, and we went to the motel room I'd gotten for the night. I got out the bag and was looking at it and was like ""what is this? It looks like a cactus."" Then I guess the room wasn't a room so much anymore, a man walked in the door and down the hall to where we were sitting and I asked him what he thought of the contents of my bag. Then the cactus turned into mushrooms. He told us to eat the red caps. I took the one with the most red, but noticed it had an eye on it. I asked him if it was okay to eat the one with the eye and he said ""yes, it'll be very good."" I ate it. The man started to leave and I asked him if he wanted a cap, he took one and went on his way. 
     Lesley and I talked about our plans. We had a bottle of vodka and she had weed. We decided to go to her house for the night.
     The next day I was driving through a neighborhood, then  stopped and parked my car. I walked up to a house that I had always heard rumors about since I was a child. I heard that the man who lived there had killed his wife, their child and had probably killed others as well. I didn't think anyone was home, so I went in. I wasn't there for very long when I heard a noise from the back of the house. I assumed it was the man and ran out the front door and down the street. 
    I quickly realized that I didn't have my car keys or anything else. I thought I must have left them in the house. I walked up the street to Kassie's house. She wasn't home. Her neighbor was home so I went to his house, just as I was going inside Kassie pulled into her driveway. 
    At my friend's neighbor's house, we went into a back room. I felt my pockets to see if I had anything in them and I found my keys were in my pockets. I also had my purse. I pulled out a bag of bud and I smoked with the neighbor out of a bong that looked like a trash can. 
    Afterwards, we, I don't know who we was. I don't know if I was with the neighbor, Kassie or Lesley, but anyway, we went in a row boat and onto the lake. My friends' houses were right on the lake. Once we were on the water I looked around and there were two other row boats nearby.  The PE teacher from my work was at the head of one boat and there were older children paddling, the other boat was similar.
    That was it.

weird huh?

in reality...me & Kas saw Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. It was really good, except that it wasn't. It somehow fell short."

Ed & I saw Fahrenheit 9/11. It was very biased not in Bush's favor, obviously if you've heard about it. Somethings I did like seeing brought up. Like the simple fact that Bush did not win the popular vote in 2000, that people were trying to contest to him being brought into office and were basically ignored, that the Bin Ladin family was flown out of the country after 9/11 and that probably wasn't the smartest thing to do in that situation, and the fact that people are dying on both ends and don't know why. Alot of people cannot find justification for this war. I still don't see it clearly, if at all. but there are alot of things that I feel are wrong with this country, not just the wars. War is ridiculous. It is so absurd, especially when no one else agrees that it is necessary.  Well, the film will make you think and that is good."

---------------------------------------------------------------

The Olympic Games start in August and I wonder if it's possible that I 
could
care less about anything? I know what you're thinking.  What about the 
Tour
de France?  Clearly, that is the lamer than the Olympics.

Yes, the Tour de France does suck.  It's long, boring, and has the word
France in it.  But on a positive note, in spite of the fact that a 
cancer
ridden American is supposed to win, there is virtually no coverage of 
the
event in the U.S.  It is easy to pretend it doesn't exist.

But the Olympics, they just won't shut up about it.  It is full of 
athletes
you've never heard of, playing games that you don't care about, for 
really
lame prizes.  What's the point?  Even on Fear Factor you get $100,000 
and
all you have to do is eat pig scrotum- not dedicate 18 years, 12 hours a
day/7 days a week to jumping over a stick.

At the Olympics, maybe, you get ten seconds of fame.  You want ten 
seconds
of fame so bad, marry Britney Spears.  Then if you're incredibly lucky, 
you
get a shiny, gold necklace.  Big deal.  If you want to wear a big, gold
medallion- go work for Ja Rule.  Not only do you get a necklace, but you
 get
a 9 millimeter, a crack pipe, and unlimited blowjobs from skanky, 
preteen
groupies.

It is un-American to be the best at something and not get paid.  If you're
such a great runner; go play football.  If you're so great at throwing a
javelin; can't you learn to throw a slider?  And if you're such a great,
male gymnast; why not make gay porn?

How can we compete with other countries where the citizens clearly have
nothing better to do than train for the Olympics.  Africans are chasing
kangaroos all day just to get to work.  The women on the Taiwanese ping 
pong
team can serve a ping pong ball at close to 97 miles per hour, and that's
just using their assholes.

We have Playstation in America, not to mention Playstation II.  Do we 
really
have time to spend throwing a discus, or learning the rules to arcane 
games
like soccer?

Why are there so many great swimmers in Europe?  Because they hope that 
one
day they can swim to America, collect welfare, and eat Funyuns and 
Poptarts.

It makes sense that other countries actually like the Olympics because 
for
one fleeting instance they can compete with America.  When Americans 
want
to compete on the International level we invade your country, arrest 
your
leader, burn down your homes, and murder your people.  That's the 
American
way.

Go for the gold?  Go fuck yourself."

I visited a friend tonight who I had not seen in quite a while. Ooo, new things. Life is different for her these days and different for me as well, but in drastically different ways.

I saw a deer at Wekiva today. I loved it. I saw a few other animals native and common in Florida such as...lizards...racoon...two armadillos...spiders...I love the armadillo, he's always there! I also saw a shit load of loud as people splashing around in the spring. It was like fucking Wet N Wild without the awful music blasting. The trail I took was nice though, I ran into very few people. The exersize was appreciated.

No more! Goodnight!"

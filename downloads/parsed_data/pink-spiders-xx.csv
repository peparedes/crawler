"event","Hah, Jordanna, you're one to tell me to update my livejournal. When was the last time you updated? Well, either way, we have one together now, so it shouldn't be too much of an issue. Uh, since when have Kat and Paul been friends Jordanna? Honestly. Uhm, not much to update about. Jordanna just left for Abbotsford, which is really upsettting. I'm going to miss her. It's just too bad that we couldn't have been friends while I was there. She may be staying in Abbotsford for the whole month of August. Well, since I have a new livejournal, I don't know if I'll be using this one all too much. It's not that I don't like it, but I'll just be regularily updating the one I now have with Jordanna. 

I had an interesting conversation with Jordanna and Jace last night. Apparently, Jace is a porn star. XD. I don't think I've laughed that much in months. He also has a gerbil that dwells in his ass named Boris =]. Tehe, you know you have no life when. Other than that, not too much has been going on. Stephanie left for BC today. I'm so envious of her, especially when it's about twenty degrees there, and about fifty here. Sometimes I wish I had never left. I really miss my dad, and I know I shouldn't, but I really do. I just wish things could have been different between the two of us. Anyways, before I get all, blah, I better end this off. Uhm, yeah, Jace I added you to the new LJ. LJ user: frog_stomp for all of you who actually want to read it."

"event","Well, since it's been such a long time, I thought I might as well update this. A few things have happened since I last updated my journal, well, more than a few. Yes, I am aware that my grammar at the moment is horrible, but I really don't care. Jenn went away to camp a while ago, and before that there had been a lot of talk about removing Totoro, Jenn's RP site, from the internet. Of course I wanted to keep it, but only because at the time I had been really into RPing, and Jenn wanted it gone. Jenn was totally right when she said that the site changed people, and it did, so I don't totally blame her, although I am still upset about it.

Anyways, when she got back, she left the site, and gave her admin powers over to Jace, but this was done only to keep people, like myself, happy. Needless to say, a short time after that, it was gone. I was really upset with Jenn that day, not only for what she had done, but also for some things she had said to me earlier that day. I won't get into it now, because things are finally cooled down, but let's just say that everybody was less than happy with Jenn.

The thing that had bothered me was that she kept asking me about Totoro, about if I wanted it or not and such. She knew how I felt, but was determined to have the conversation. Everytime it came up, it ended in yelling.

Well, later that night, after the Totoro incident, Jenn came to my house. Most things were sorted out, but I know that the both of us still had some things to sort out. I think we're still sorting them out, but whatever. Things have finally cooled down.

That night, Jace and I were talking and Jace made a new site: Kingston Academy. It is also a literate roleplay site. It had been going well for a while, and then one of the site's members and myself got into a disagreement. The member will not be named. As of right now, I'm not too sure I want to RP anymore. It has nothing to do with the argument either. I just haven't been into it so much, not since Totoro, and after my leaving the site the first time. I don't know. The only reason I ever RPed was because of Jenn, and now that she doesn't have a site, and we aren't on such good grounds at the moment, I just don't feel like doing it anymore. Also, I'm not really that good at RPing, and I feel that I just bring everybody else down. I don't know yet, but I'm still if-y on what I want to do.

Anyways, Jenn left to the cottage with Nick the other day. I hope things are doing well. I'm still a little upset about her taking him, and lying to me about it, but it's really not a big deal. I just hope she takes this opportunity to tell him already. It's been way too long.

Stephanie is leaving to B.C. for two weeks tommorow, and Nathan is always busy with Jayme, so I'm going to be bored for the next little while. Jordanna was supposed to have been here now, but her trip to Abbotsford got delayed, and now she's going to be there for the whole month of August. It really is a shame that she couldn't make it here, because I really wanted to see her. It's been so long. Not to mention that I have nobody to go with to Warped Tour, or to see Social Code. It's rather annoying, but I'm sure the bands I wanted to see that were playing Warped this year will play again next year, and Soco is a Canadian band, so they'll come through Ottawa again when they finish their record.

Well, at least I can make some money this summer. I'm going to work at the fair this summer. Yes, I do know that it would make me a carnny, but it's good money. Jenn and I are supposed to do it together, and I really hope she still wants to, because I need a ride to and from the fair every day so I can work. Warped is taking place on the last day of the fair, so I'm sure I'll be a little upset that day, but who knows, maybe Dave will get off his ass and find a way to come and see me. Jeeze, I need to meet that kid. Jenn has cool cousins.

Hmm, well, it's not all bad. Laura might be able to make Soco's show with me. Chances are that she can't though. Either way, I have hope. This update is getting a little long, so I think I'm just going to stop now. I should update this more often though. I also am aware that anybody can read this, but I don't care. Just, don't start with me now. You know who you are."

"event","It's been such a long time since I posted anything in here, so it's about time I did...I think. Anyways, in the last little while all I've been doing is hanging out with Stephanie and Nathan. It's been cool enough. I had so many funny things that happened while we were watching Donnie Darko to post in here, but too many things happened, and I forgot all of them. Opps. Anyways, Jenn got back from camp yesterday, and I just realized that she can be very grumpy when she's tired.

""Fuck off, I'm sleeping Lizzy!""

Haha, I've never heard somebody scream so loud in my life. I'm thinking that if we had surprised her right when she got home, things wouldnt have gone too well. Well, we got to see her yesterday and it was great. Haha, good wholesome scrabble, eh Jenn? :P It was a good learning experiance. Best word I've ever made up(cock-spout-tits). Haha, it was fun. I've missed Jenn so much in the last little while. We're going to hang out again today.

In other news, the plans for Jordanna's visit here seem to be going as planned. Haha, I hope she can come. It's going to be hella awesome, plus Jenn and Stephanie are going to be away at the same time, and I won't have anything to do.

Well, Jace broke his hand in a fight again, and I think he also broke his collar bone? I can't exactly remember, but I do remember that he's in some type of a split or something, and so can't type too well. This means that he can't roleplay, and so I'm really not interested in roleplaying now since the only /active/ roleplays I have going are with him...*sighs*

Well, other than that, not too much has been going on. I can't wait for Jenn's new RP site...maybe it won't die as Totoro has. I hope not. It's going to be waay better than Totoro, or I hope. Uhh, need to remind Stephanie to bring her dance mat today. DDR versus! Yes! Jenn and I are also going to make a piczo site together...it's going to out-piczo every piczo site out there!

Anyways, I need to get going. Jenn and Steph are going to be here soon. Byee."

"event","Yesterday, I was lied to by my friends, but it was the greatest lie ever. I had been planning to hang out with them, since it had been my birthday and all, but they all were seeminly busy. I had then jsut planned to hang out with them the next day. Even though all of their excuses seemed pretty good, I thought that there was something going on, but didn't know what.

At about 6:30, I was alone at my house with my sister half naked...Haha, and my sister kept hinting that I should put some clothes on in the next half hour to come. I thought nothing of it, and did what she said. At 7pm Jenn walked in the door, followed shortly by Jenn and Nathan. It was amazing, and while we were walking I kept hinting that I wanted to go to the ice cream store near my house to get something but they kept saying that, no, they didn't want to go. Needless to say I got an ice cream cake that night. It was pretty much the best birthday ever.

Now, for some funny things that happened that night. Here they are:

*walking past park*

Stephanie- ""Nathan, why don't you jump into that garbage can?""

Nathan- *jumps onto bench and runs to the end where the trash can is* *halfway inside garbage can* ""Ahhh, there's poop in there.""

<p align=""center"">***</p>

*little sister brings down Stephanie's hair clip*

*20 minutes passes*

Jenn- ""WOW, Steph they found your hair thing""

Other than that, my night was pretty normal. I had a great night, and Stephanie stayed the night. Best birthday in a long time."

"event","Okay, so as of right now it is 12:06, and officially my birthday. I hope people remember.I'm so sad about Totoro. I know I had left it, but I really love that site. I love the people there. I love everything about it, and leaving it was the biggest mistake I have ever made. I was so excited when I joined the site again, and then I read Jenn's livejournal entry about it and got really upset. I'm not like some people on the site, where I'm addicted to the point of never leaving my computer chair, but I am slightly addicted. I really don't want her to shut the site down. Even if it does die, it needs to stay there so that we can have some cool-ass memories. Jenn, if you're reading this, you should keep the site open as your birthday present to me. You don't need to do anything else. Just hanging out with you is cool enough. 

P.S. Jace, if you're reading this, I /need/ you to reply to my posts like NOW. If you don't, I'll come with my toy emo gun, and shoot you.
 Its my birthday:D"

"event","Okay, well I rejoined Totoro, and was sort of happy about it last night, but just now I went and read Jace's LJ and saw a comment that Ashley (Ashton?) left. It really pissed me off, because she was twisting my words around in it to seem like the reason I left Totoro was due to the fact that Totoro did not have experianced roleplayers. Why would I say something like that when I have only been roleplaying for a year? I said I was godmoding when I was roleplaying with Jonie, first of all, because I was blocked and because the post that she had left didn't have much for me to work with. I suppose I could have asked Jonie to edit her post, but at the time it didn't occur to me that I could do that. 

Don't get me wrong, I didn't leave because I was intimidated by Ashton. Why would I be intimidated by somebody who lives thousands of kilometers away, and can only say words to me over the interent? I mean, it was not that I was intimidated at all, it's because I am sick of her bitching over Totoro about how high-and-mighty she is, and about the stupid roleplay I have going with Jace. Although I don't know the exact details of what happened last year, I can say that two virtual characters licking each other in a fictional circumstance is not something to freak out about. She had already left the site, so I don't see how any of it was her buisness. I'm sick of her bitching me out all the time, so I hope that Jenn or Jace will kick her off the site already. It's been going downhill since she was allowed back onto the site.

On a happier note, Jace, Jenn, and I had a freaking amazing conversation over AIM last night...it's too bad that I don't have a copy of it. :{ I'll ask Jenn if she does tonight, so that I can post it here. Hmm, maybe Jace saved it. Anyways, I'm out to reply to one of my boards on Totoro and plot a way to kill Ellie. Later. xox."

"event","Well, I'm sure that Ashton has gotten what she wanted. Seriously. I finally got up and just left the site. I'll probably rejoin at a later date, or just wait until Jenn makes the new site.

She's been bitching everybody on Totoro out for the last couple weeks about how she's been crying over this stupid board that Jace and I had going. It was fucking insane. All that happened was our characters licked one another, but what the hell do I know? I wasn't a part of the old site.

Anyways, I'm sorry to say that Jenn is in the hospital again, and I feel partly responsible. Maybe I shouldn't have stayed up really late four days in a row with her. I mean, she needs to sleep, and so now I feel guilty. I just hope she gets better soon...

Hmm, well today I'm planning to see a movie with Steph, and I should get going now since I need to finish my summer school stuff over the internet...:/ Later days."

"event","Jenn is the coolest person I have ever met. I mean it. For the last few days, I have been hanging out with her and Stephanie, and it has been fucking awesome. May I remind all of you, that when you are running on three days with no sleep that babysitting money, movies you've seen far too many times, DDR(dance dance revolution), and cheese do not mix. 

Funny shit can happen at three o'clock in the morning. Here are a few:

*Jenn talks to me about new site, while I watch the Nightmare Before Christmas for the 8376543572789th time*

Me-""Fuck, you know you're a rip counter WHEN YOU CAN RIP ONE OFF...Jeeze!""
Jenn-""Mary...are you okay?""




*Jenn and Steph talk me into buying some cheese for nachos*   *20 minutes later*

Me-""Dammit, I spent my concert money on cheese guys!""



Anyways, after all was said and done, it was a pretty fucking cool weekend, except for the creepy guy in the video store hitting on me. It was rather odd, but I think I might have actually hit on him too...:S I really need to get some sleep at any rate, so later days."

"event","I really hate that Ash was allowed to join Jenn's RP site again. It messed everything up. Jace and I had an RP going on, she came back, and then gave him this guilt trip so that he wouldn't RP with me. The whole thing was over my character licking his character, and vice versa, which is lame, but she got jelous and apparently cried. Now that Jace feels guilty, he won't finish the RP with me. She wasn't even supposed to come back after all the drama that went down last yeah when the site was closed...whatever. Anyways, other that that things have been pretty cool. I've been hanging out with Jenn and Stephanie non-stop for the past week, and we've been up all night all of those times. Dance Dance Revolution! Other than that, summer school starts tommorrow, and Jordanna is coming out for the summer. Anyways, I'm gonna get going.

"event","Okay, so right now it's raining outside which totally ruins my plans for the night, but I'm not too upset. I guess I could still have Jenn and Stephanie over for a movie or something tonight, although I'm not all too sure that Jenn will be too keen on coming. She's been a little more dead set on hanging out with Nick and Logan in the last little while, and I really dislike the two. It's not even really that I dislike them, as it is that they dislike me. It really bothers me too, since they've never had any more than a two second conversation with me ever in thier lives. They have no reason to hate me, but they can do what they like I suppose.

Other than that, things have been pretty okay. Jenn spent the night at my house a little while ago and we stayed up pretty much all night laughing. It was great; I haven't spent time with her in a while. Steph is probably going to be coming over today, after I babysit of course. And next week, summer school starts. I'm going to do an extra course, and wish that I wasn't now, but it's too late. I'm just going to get it over with. Well, I've got to get going so I'll eventually finish this later.

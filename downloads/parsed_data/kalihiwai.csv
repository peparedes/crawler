"event","Today marks one year since we arrived in Kauai.. Who knew the dramatic turn our lives were going to take?? I guess God did, but wow.. it surprised the heck outa me! What a loving God He is... He knew just what we needed. So, one year later - with a little perspective in my pocket, I can honestly say I believe we made the right decision and are following God's plan.. YAY!!

What a blessing this year has been to us emotionally, relationally, financially - you name it... things have come together in  alot of ways for us. I look forward to the surprises, twists, turns and blesings that this coming year has in store for us.

I'll wait and make a list of prayers, hopes and dreams for the coming year at New Years.. I have alot in mind."

"event","What a trip!! Oh, it was so fun. We got up at 4:15 this morning to go on a zodiak rafting trip along the Na Pali Coast of Kauai. This is a portion of the land that is virtually uninhabitable and due to that pristine and gorgeous. The mountains are so steep and sheer. In height, they're compared to the Sears tower, etc. It doesn't seem like it to look at them from the raft. This is what our raft looked like.

The trip started off rather calm, the water was nearly as smooth as glass - we spotted some dolphins and circled back around to get a good look at them. It was hard to get decent pictures because as our guides explained they're sleeping in the morning and not very active. There were alot of babies though, and they were sooooo cute!! So these are spinner dolphins:

Most of our pictures on the way out were washed out because we were going into the sun. This shows an excellent profile of the beginning of the coast though.

Our Tour guides were a riot sharing the legend, lore and history of the islands' coastline as we drove out. They wove their funny quotes and hillarious personalities into their stories with ease.  They took us through a number of caves in the coastal walls of the Na Pali... those were amazing, apparently in the winter when the surf reaches 40-60 feet they hit these caves and the air pressure is so great that the caves continue to grow each year very rapidly. You could see the etching on the walls from the pressure. Phenomenal the wondrous power of the ocean!! One of the caves had an open roof and the power of the water shoots straight up to create a spouting water hole in the winter that can be seen for miles. a couple of the caves we went into had waterfalls cascading over the opening... my girlfriend is so cute!! She said I had to take my hat off because the legend is that the waterfalls cause increased fertility! She had heard me talking of a time when we were trying for a third. (On a side note - I'm not sure HOW I feel about that anymore) This is from the inside of one of the caves:

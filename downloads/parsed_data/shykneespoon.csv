Lil Davey died.  Sorry for those of you who liked him.  As it turns out, he would rather ask why I'm wearing a dress than say I look nice.   If you catch my catch.  Also, I wasn't so nice to him.  THE END. 
So now I'm on an epic apt search.  Who can find the cheapest apt with a washer/dryer and hardwood floors?  Or, who wants the cheapest roommate?  This should be a gameshow.  What else is new.  Oh, work stuff.  Now I own the fry station along with the other two, and they even let me work grill.  I saute things that are on fire.  And they sent me, one other cook, and the kitchen manager to open a new location.  That's it. We kicked it's ass.  So basically, now I wear a chef coat, just for looks, not a real chef, but goddamnit I'm on the way!  Also, who thinks I should move away once I'm a manager at work and have a good deal of kitchen experience and have saved a few dollars?  Hmmm.  
Ufck it.  I'm going to be a traveling porn star.  Vanilla sex only.  Easiest.  Job.  Ever."

it took several entries and guesses before i remembered my password/username. but i did it, yay me. ok. i knew my username cuz i still remembered someone else's livejournal address. Formerly known as Sleepless in Vermillion, it was yours.  If you even look at these things.
Well, kids.
I am not the blogger I once was.
Oh no.
I'm badass cook. And by badass cook, I mean that I do salads and desserts for an Irish Pub, and sometimes they let me work the fry station. And I helped name on of the sandwiches.  And my boss protects me from creepers at the bar. 
And I'm a barista in a super cafe.  All coffees served within a week of roasting. Fucking delicious, locally owned, sweeter espresso than everywhere else, and as long as my boobies aren't totally showing, I can wear whatever I please.
Like this sweet Barbie(tm) shirt.
Yes. It's trademarked. Actually the shirt doesn't have the trademark on it.  My Barbie is black and rocking a fro. Eat it, blondie.
Oh yeah, and, could someone remind me why I'm in Virginia?"

If you're going to get stuck on I-40 for an hour, make SURE you use the bathroom first.  Also, it's probably not a good idea to pee in your travel mug b/c A)What if it overflows? and 2)  You may want to used it for coffee later and no one wants to drink coffee out of something that was peed in.

so he came and he talked and he cried and i talked and i cried because we're both kind of miserable in general, the fact that we've broken up notwithstanding. the boy needs to be institutionalized. then ian came over and he felt awkward so ian left and then nick left b ut only after chainsmokingly telling me how stupid he is and that he doesn't expect us to get back together or anything, he's just miserable and doesn't have a reason to live.
and um. well. after the whole ian dui semi-prank thing i decided that i'd rather not devote my time to making other people feel better. who's gonna make me feel better? i can't do that for more than one person at a time, and i win. so. yay me.
hopefully the guy from the gallery in yankton likes my photos...then i'll have done something neato. and wholly un-depressing. sort of."

"event","never ever make them. it's a terrible experience. i found this recipe for honey oat pancakes and i was like, ooh, honey oat pancakes. but we had no buttermilk so i used raspberry yogurt instead, thinking it would make a delicious pancake. what happened was a batter that was more like cookie dough that had to be carefully spread onto a buttered pan so that it would cook all the way through and not just burn the outsides, leaving the middle all gooey. eventually i started treating the batter like scrambled eggs. i'm calling it granola. i bet it would be delicious sprinkled over some poached peaches a la mode.

there's a photo contest in yankton. it might already be over, since there was no date on the flyer. but if it's not, i'm going to try. i hope i do.  so. gotta get some kids out on the river cuz the themething is Life on the River.  i've never seen as much life on the river as when we go there. yes.

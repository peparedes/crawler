"event","doctor's offices smell weird.

and that is where i am right now..because of my stupid eye.and my allergies suck,and its just a sucky day.
i probably wont even be able to do anything tonight,even though i just had to go to my church lockin..but id rather do that than just sit at home.however i have a funny feeling thats exactly what im going to be doing
also,im running on about 3 hours of sleep right now.

last night was really weird for me..i found out stuff i didnt want to know,but maybe i needed to know it.i have realized that i need to talk about things more,even if i dont feel comfortable with it.i dont confront people about my feelings enough and i end up just keeping it inside.that doesnt really seem to work out for me either.
just last night..i realized how much i really dont like to associate with girls.online is ridiculous and i dont like talking to people on it because you cant tell how they're feeling,but i could just tell how fake nice girls can be.honestly,i was ripshit.and i dont hate a lot of people..i rarely even do,especially if i dont have a reason,but i can honestly say right now that i have a growing hate for this person.i just dont understand why girls cant just keep to themselves and not get themselves into other peoples business and try to ruin things just to make themselves feel better.if you really have that big of a problem take it up with the person directly,instead of making the people that are associated with them go through hell.last night was pretty much close to hell for me.
this is also another reason why i am so grateful for the close girl friends that i do have and that i know i can trust.everyone else is so lame.

im done for now.
who knows,i probably will have like 4 other entries today considering i have nothing else to do and i feel like i need to vent"

so it was possibly one of the best weekends ever.
on friday i saw xmen3 with leia seth isaac mike d dave connor tim and andrew.
it was a really good movie,so that was a good time.i also went swimming in toris 65 degree pool with her and leia.that was also fun.
i cleaned alot on saturday,but then i went to Nick's house :] Him, Cam, James and I all went mini golfing and then back to nick's house.probably one of the funniest things of my life.james and cam left so then me and nick played some nintendo 64.i owned him i must say
so yesterday i had church.and then leia brian and nick all came over and we chilled,walked to leias and hung out there for a little,then me and nick came back here to have dinner with my parents.watched a little lotr because we're cool like that, and then he left.i enjoyed yesterday<3
i enjoyed being lazy today though.it was nice to be able to just sit outside all day.sucked how i had so much homework though, i cant even do my huge spanish project.but its not my fault that it didnt email to me.

theres only about 11 school days left anyways"

"event","<center>things have been great lately.
this weekend i stayed at leias house because my parents were visiting my sister in NY.on friday i had a game which went well,and that night we had a sleepover at leias with all the girls.saturday me&leia hung out and started getting ready for FALL OUT BOY at like 1 when the concert was at 7 haha.we went with alex and craig and met up with some other sweet people.panic in the disco room, boys night out, motion city soundtrack, and the starting line also played.it was pretty much the best time ever.sunday i went to church, then went back to leias and we sat around all day.this weekend the weather has been sucky, but its getting cold and that makes me happy.so my weekend was pretty much awesome.school is going good too.luckily i havent gotten any more detentions and homework isnt too bad.i have like 2 more weeks of volleyball until the season's over and that makes me really sad because i love it.i have an away game tomorrow and then dance..so it should be a long day.unfortunately there's this really good band thats going to be playing at my church on tuesday too and my youth group is going to get to have dinner with them and stuff but i cant go..SUCKS.no school today though,which resulted in me cleaning EVERYTHING.whatevvs, i found some cute clothes that i didnt know i had.my computers dead forever,so im stuck on this laptop for a long time.besides i have like 4785635 pictures that i want to post but i cant due to the fact i cant resize them BECAUSE my computers dead.it just kills it all.i will post them as soon as i can though.But anyways this week is nothing special..volleyball practice/games and dance.ALIS COMING HOME ON FRIDAY AND IM EXCITED BECAUSE I MISS HER A LOT.this weekend is also jessicas last week in NH..i cant believe that she's actually moving..it's so dumb.but shes staying at my house all weekend and i think we're going shopping on saturday morning.maybe toris house with the girls saturday afternoon? possibly..
i finally got caught up on laguna&real world..and everwood has started again so my life is complete.i want to sleep more, and i want the rainy days to stop.but other than that, i love life and my friends, and its all good<3</center>"

North Carolina was pretty good,we just drove around a lot.We ended up coming home early too so that was sweet(Thursday)I missed everyone,it was like seperation anxiety x 98759435.Friday Cara,Tori,Amelia and I all went bowling and that was funnn.There was a Fishercats game,or so we thought,that night that Cara and I were going to go to with my parents,but it was the wrong date.We went to Longhorn insteaddd.They sang happy birthday to her even though it was like a couple weeks ago,but it was fun cuz her birthday party was the next day.We talked to Leia on my cell since she had just gotten home from Florida and we missed her a lot :].Got home around 8:30'ish,and then just went into my room.Can't do that right now,my room is so trashed because we're painting a lot of stuff in it.mehh.So Saturday I went to Leia's house around 12 to hang out and get ready for the partayy.Everyone came and it was pretty awesome.We went outside and stuff for a little while,and it was just good to see everyonnee.I slept over Leia's with Cara and that was wicked fun:]I had to leave early for church,where we didnt do anything for confirmation class so i didnt get why i had to go,but whatever.Came home and now I have nothing to do,can't hang out with anyone or anything.my house is boring.

<P><STRONG>friday<BR></STRONG>two hour delay.matt came over and he watched tv while i had to get ready for play.we did the show for the 5th and 7th graders.it was all going pretty good for a dress rehearsal.besides the fact that i got punched in the face by Taylor.jaw was shifted, bloody lip and everything.Leia called me a troublemaker&nbsp;when she had a migraine.it was just a very interesting day.almost missed the bus because we didnt finish the show untill 2:30'ish and we had 5 minutes to take pictures,change,put everything away, get all our stuff, and get our progress reports from our teachers.yah, that was fun.<BR>got home and hung out.called leia and then went over to her house.we watched the Notebook and cried a lot and had FRIED CHICKEN and it was funnnn.</P>
<P><STRONG>saturday<BR></STRONG>woke up and we had donuts and mochas,totally ownage.my mom picked me up and we went to salem so i could get new dance shoes.got them and i got a job application for there which is pretty cool cuz then i could actually have money.we'll seeee.went home and ALMOST finished decorating my room in like, fifteen minutes.i showered and then went back over to leia's. hmm obviously had more fun cuz she is like the best beeffefffooevv ever! we ran around outside in the cold and then craig and alex met us and we walked around leias neighborhood.alex wore leias sweatshirt and we put&nbsp;a sign on him that said ""IM A LITTLE PRINCESS"".ohh yess.there were group hugs and snowballs and keyboards involved in there at some point too.<BR>okay, so they ran home and we went inside and tried to warm up.then Jay and his family came over and i got to meet them all.they were extremely nice and we ate a lot.we watched movies too and then tried to see if we could run on the tredmill at the fastest it goes.pretty funny.we went outside then too and started to play like tag/something else in the dark but we got bored with that and so we walked down to Toris house and got her to come outside with us.well, we walked to the top of her driveway with her and then she had to go inside, but it wassss fun.we walked back to leias house and watched home videos of leia and jay.i must say that was very entertaining.we all ended up going to bed around midnight, but leia and i were still a little bit wired.</P>
<P><STRONG>sunday<BR></STRONG>i had to wake up at 7:50 so my mom could pick me up at 8 for church.couldnt wake leia up, so i just left.went to church but didnt stay for confirmation class cuz i had a pounding headache, which i do still have a little bit of.typed my english poem and cleaned my room a little bit.still have to do my math hw that was due friday,do laundry,and finish cleaning my room.</P>

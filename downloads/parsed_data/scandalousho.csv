so yesterday i woke up, went to my bank and paid them $200.00 dollars, got my paycheck and cashed it at publix. while i was there the lotto screen told me i should have won a million dollars cuz of the numbers. so i go home and check and i didnt win anything.

so i went to taste of new york to start drinking since i wasnt a millionaire, then i proceeded to la casita where i drank for an hour by myself cuz everyone hates me, but i got lots of free drinks so i shouldnt complain. then after leaving there i went to mona's for some more cocktails. this is where it gets exciting.

so im there drinking lots of long islands cuz their half price, so after a few i decide ""hey, i should karaoke"". so my drunk ass gets on stage, and starts karaoking to the milkshake song. at this point i couldnt really talk, so i was basically slurring the song and shaking my ass. apparently i didnt get my kick after just one, so i decided to sing ""baby got back"" where once again i was slurring and shaking my ass. 

after making a huge ass of myself, i decided to drink some more and got the lovely idea to karaoke again, well the maraoke guy was being mean to me and told me to get off the stage. so with my singing ego bruised, i drank more..socialized..and proceeded to leave because he was mean to me.

apparently i gave someone a ride home, and bought 3 bags of chips from somewhere. next thing i know, i wake up with chicken wings next to me.

it was a very silly night."

"event","i've decided its time for me to dust the dirt* off my shoulders. i was happy for a little while being back in fort myers, because i got to hang out with my friends. but now i dont hang out with anyone. im tired of trying to get people to hang out with me. im not that lame. so oh well. i'll do my little job..pay off my shit..save money and peace out again. but im doing it right this time so i dont get fucked and have to move back horrible in debt.

and i hope i do become rich and famous..so i can shove it in all my so-called friends and the haters faces :)

"event","So I have decided I'm going to accomplish more of my goals and take a vacation to London. I'm not sure when I'll be able to go, because of all my money issues at the moment. But I will go there and tear it up!! Maybe I'll be thin by then and I can make babies with hott english boys. That would be exciting. I'm totally gonna get a job there working in a Pub and never come back :)"

"event","i've already realised i generally make bad decisions in life. its just what i do. it's why im horribly in debt, living at home with my parents, am poor, and why im single.

however last night i made much more terrible decisions in more quanitity as well. 

i met a boy at a bar..or rather he initiated our meeting. decided he should hang out with me when i went to play with jenn..then got more drunk. asked jenn if i could use her room to make babies, and once we left. well im going to have to go with a no comment on anymore details. 

but i suck at life. :)

im HOPING this weekend turns out exactly like im planning. as in i'll make lots of money and my wonderful plan will work out for the best. because crossroads and mortal combat are amazing. as is the rest of it. muhahaha

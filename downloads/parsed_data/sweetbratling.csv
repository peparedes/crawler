And again It made those eating disorder demonds raise there evil heads and make me not want to eat at all any more, but I fought them down again and came home had my yogurt and orange. I know this is just my body adjusting but it still very frustrateing. But I know Im feeling healthier and I am willing to bet my colesteroll and blood pressure are down, though my blood pressure was never really high to begin with.

"event","<p><strong><em><font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""2"">I just got home from the vet with charlie. poor dog had things shuved up his ass poked in his ear was stabed with a needle and ingected and had blood taken from his neck (and I thought humen Dr's where vampires) and he was soo good for it all. The Doc is running a batery of tests but gave in ingection to stop the&nbsp;runs and his throwing up. The Doc also said his teeth are really bad and the front ones are really loose and that upsets me because I do take really good care of my charlie he means everything to me, but he said sometimes it cant be helped and that smaller dogs like charlie often do have that problem. Charlie has always had really bad breath ever since we got him as a baby which means the bactirea count in his mouth is high to bigin with and all that can make him really sick and even cause heart problems. So he has to go back for a dental apointment, I made the apointment but its gunna caust me a fortun, todays visit alone with ingection lab fees and medication caust $279.00 and I cant emagine the dental beeing less because that is usualy a lot more with sedation and everything but it needs to be done and so its beeing done, its a good thing my mom owes me so much money from working for her because she is just going to pay it out of that, which most likely will leave me with very little of that to draw on, good thing I start work on tuesday otherswise Id most likely be totaly broke and then the trip to hershey would really be off, sure it would upset Marni and Lanie but I have to put charlie first right now. im kinda stressed about it because it will be a lot of money but I have a good amount still owed from my mom and i am going back to work. And seeing as I have no real other bills I should be good, plus I know my mom is going to help out with the money. She usualy pays the vet bills all together but I dont want her to have to pay all that much for my dog!!! She said we will wait and see how much the dental thing is and how nessisery the prosedure is if it is an elective thing Ill see what other things I can do to take care of charlies teeth, they make special chew things to help with dental issues and stuff so we will talk to the vet about what our options are and if those loose front teeth HAVE to come out or if he just wants to do a cleaining and how much he is asking to do it. I know my mom wont let me get screwed over on this by haveing procedures that arent nessisery or that are beeing charged to much for. A lot of times vets will look to do things that arent 100% nessisery in order to make money off of it, and while I like my vet a lot that doesnt mean he wouldnt offer a treatment that wasnt totaly nessisery aspecialy since Im young and easier to take advantage of and he saw how worried I was, so best to let my parents take care of it and see if it NEEDS to be done or not what the options are and how much it will caust. But really right now though the money is stressing me what is most importent is that charlie be ok, because if he isnt ok Im not going to be ok, he means everything to me and if anything happend to him i dont know what I would do.<br /><br />I been letting Marni Drive everywhere with her permit since she turned 18 and can now drive with me, and so she was driveing us all over today (we had to go to the super market because charlie has to eat white rice and boiled chicken for the next few days and not the regular food, so we had to get that after the vet) anyway she was hasitating way to much on a left turn and we got stuck at the light 3 times becuase of it, so I said to her ""there is a lot to be said for beeing an agressive driver, you can be agressive and curtiouse at the same time"" and she actually said to me ""yeah but Im a very passive person"" OMG I almost choked, I said ""have you spent anytime with you lately?? here let me introduce yourself to you..."" Yeah she didnt like that LOL.. Just found that to be very funny.<br /></font></em></strong></p>"

"event","<em><strong><font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""1"">spent all night last night helping David get his butt out of NY. LOL it really was supposed to be an early day he told me 10:30 11:00 at the latest, I was supposed to pick will up and meet him and Tim at his house then just help get them off. Didnt really work like that, it never works like that when Davids involved (I love him anyway!!!!) wound up goign to Tims house with Will and then me and Will where sent to go get the pizza that David wanted to bring with him on the trip, he is crazy picky about pizza!! Again traveling to parts unknown to find this pizza place. Hey at least this time my navagator wasnt half drunk and passing out!! We found the place rather easily got back to Davids house and waited in a rather aquerd silence for him to arrive. David got a hair cut and it was much shorter then I thought but I really like it :) any way after that it was all down hill and the night went fast, between helping David pack and helping load the rental car it was at least 12:45-1:00am befor I got back into my car to head home, now admitedly for us that is an early night, but not as early as David had said it was gunna be. I have Davids night shirt that I promised to mend while he is away.. it has a huuggeee rip, as well as a part of his manuscript or whatever it is that I said I would type up with some of the spare time I have (I have a LOT of spare time since school ended last month) but man David has been high mantanance latley LOL!!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Marni is playing martre and its getting old, she comes down here for a pat on the back because she isnt going to hang out with her friends because I didnt sleep last night so I cant safely drive so she needs to drive when we go to the vet and then to pick up Lanie. She got really pissed off when I asked her why she was fishing for a pat on the back for takeing care of her family responsabilities. I mean I dont know I just dont think its all that polite to ASK for a thank you, I dont know she does it a lot and it gets to me mostly because I dont need her to tell me how to behave aspecially when it is something I already know to do, like when she tells me to buckle in the car, I KNOW TO DO THAT!!! But when she tells me to it makes me not want to just to show her she is my little sister and cant&nbsp;order me around, I hate when she does that. I dont know it that makes&nbsp;sence,&nbsp;besides I already had thanked her, Im always polite and say thank you when people do things for me even when it is something that they should be doing out of responsabilities. You know what if she would have let me sleep this morning instead of waking me up every five minuts to get out and take charlie to the vet I would be ok to drive get lanie take charlie back to the vet (becuase&nbsp;dad and Marni took him while I waited for the call from layn brayant&nbsp; but the vet cant see him till 4:30 so we have to go back) The best was she was rushing me out of bed yelling at me to get up, and I was admitedly haveing issues as I had only fallen asleep about an hour earlier and she knew it because she came into me at 12 and I hadnt been asleep yet and I told her I needed a little nap befor i went anywhere, anyway she is fussing at me to get ready to go or she isnt going so I get up to go Im all ready, and she isnt ready yet she isnt even close to ready she isnt dressed and she has nair on her upper lip that she had just put there, what the Hell, I almost killed her!!! man teenagers!!!<br /><br />Anyway our fights never last long as we are really close and good friends, and I have never been able to stay mad or hold a grudge (which does work against me some times) And the problem sorted it self out and is over with already, LOL it happend as I was writeing about it here!! I really do love her sometime I just wish she would remeber who the big sister is!!! She can be such a great person but as great as she can be she has that total opposite side, which thankfully as she has gotten older we see less and less of, but I do recall hearing the C*** word again from here earlier when we dissagread and she knows how much I hate that word so she still has some work to do in the temper area but she is makeing great progress with it. She is fiesty and has a temper much like my dad, we clash because I dont have that nasty temper side and am easily hurt when she goes into her tirades. Me and my Older borther and Lanie dont really have tempers, in fact in that aspect Im the most even keeled person I know, I dont get hot under the collar and if you have made me mad you know you must have done something really realy bad because mad is not an emotion I feel usualy, I get sad and hurt, I cry and hide I dont scream and yell or get physical as Marni tends to at times, its interesting because me and Marni are alike in many ways many many ways yet we differ so much on this. Marni Lanie and I are so close we often read eachothers minds finish eachothers sentences or say the same thing at the same time, its kinda scary and also kinda nice. LOL and Lanie is like my mini me we are alike in almost every way even our hand writeing is nearly identical. We are both HUGE worry worts and stress over everything makes my mom and aunt crazy trying to keep the 2 of us calm LOL!!<br /><br /><br />However there is some really good news I got the job for shore at layn brayant and, Tuesday at 6:00pm I start work&nbsp; well my training starts!!! Im so happy about that!!!!</font></strong></em>"

My mom however doesnt think that was the real problem and thinks its something in her intestens and wants to have tests done there, she is still in the hospital today and we arent sure when she is comeing home.<br /><br />Im really kinda upset I missed the call from layn bryant. I called back as soon as I saw that I had missed the call but the manager had left for the day so I have to wait till tomarow and Im just nervouse that missing the call would some how mean I dont get the job. Everyone is telling me that isnt gunna happen aspecialy once I explain that my mom is in the Hospital and everything. They all told me that the manager isnt expeting me to wait at home all day every day waiting for the call and that I should just call back tomarow after 12 like they said the person i spoke to today said I should.<br /><br />David is going to Nicks wedding and is going by car ALL the way cross country so he is going to be gone for nearly 2 weeks. I tried telling him he couldnt go but that didnt go over too well!! im really gunna miss him but there is still phone contact and the internet and stuff and I guess 2 weeks isnt soooooooooooo long!! He leaves tonight so Im heading over there in a little while to help get him on his way and see him one last time befor he goes, I mean I did see him last night but hell if he wants to see me again today I aint gunna argue with that. Im also stopping off and picking up Will one of his friends who is going with him and Tim to the wedding since Will lives very close to me and it just makes sence that I come and get him then for David to drive all the way back and forth to pick him up when Im here already and Im going to Davids house anyway.</font></p>"

Ok so I get up out of bed go down and let him in but shit now Im up. OK So i grab a bowl of cireal and cut a banana itno it, Im determined to have a good day of eating as far as my fruits and vegtables. I mean I finally got my water intake up so this is the next thing Im working on (and Im doing well I have had a yogurt almost every day and today I have already had at least 4 maybe 5 servings of fruits and veggies) so I eat my cireal and crawl back into bed watching some TV and at about 1:00 I manage to drift back off to sleep. Now here comes Lanie at 3:00 telling me my mom is in the Hospital her ulsers are acting up again and that they cant do the needed tests today but they wont let her come home and go back for the tests tomarow so they are makeing her stay over night. Mom says she really isnt feeling poorly just that she saw blood in her stools and that was something the Doc always said to watch out for. and the Doc did conferm that there is blood in her stools so they are conserned. I think its rather odd that last time she had ulser problems was my high school graduation and she hasnt had real problems with them since, but now she is haveing problems again and what is right around the corner in like 2 weeks?? Marni's high school graduation!!!!</font></em></strong>"

"event","<em><strong><font color=""#00ccff"" size=""2"">Well I finished my last class and now all I have left are finals, <br />one is an open note one though!! <br /><br />And I dont know weather to be releaved or put out, but the Final I was busting my ass studying for was changed, it aprears the Prof couldnt get a room for our final and desided to make it a take home test , what happend was the calls that is right befor ours was schedualed to take their test on the same day as her Sons graduation so she wanted to change the day but could not get a room so she desided on a take home final but in order to be fair she desided to give us on as well (we are the same exact class only different times)I mean Im releaved but also I studied so much&nbsp;and was so stressed out about this test for so long and all for nothing now!!! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David even helped me study last night... :) he is very helpdull even if he is a pain in the ass some times :) <br /><br />On a good note I got a 46/50 on my presentation and have no more work for that law class and I handed in my last asighnment for my icons of power class so I have no more work for that class eather. all I have left are those 2 finals wich now shouldnt be all that hard. <br /><br />Also I went to my waight watchers meeting with my dad yesterday and I lost 11.8lbs (dad lost 8.6lbs) I was really very happy about that it is a great start and really gives me motivation to keep up with it. <br /><br />I went today to see Lue Ann about a job, I have worked for her the summer befor last and only didnt work for her last summer because the job I usualy do (art teacher) her daughter wanted so I didnt stand a chance and at that point all the other jobs had been taken (I was kinda pissed that she didnt have anything for me at all since I know LueAnn since I was a baby, I was one of the campers there from the time i was in diapers) Any way I went with Lanie and we both applied for jobs. I wont get the art teaching job because again her daughter wants it but she said she would look and see what els she had though Im not gunna hold my breath, it sucks though because I dont want to have to spend an antire summer home again without anything to do, and I could really use the money, any way she said she would call by the end of next week, if she doesnt Im gunna call her Monday ( a week from this comeing monday) because sometimes she just forgets these kind of things. You really have to keep on top of her or she just doesnt look or call!! Again not gunna get my hope up for anything not after she let me down last summer no way.</font></strong></em>"

Damn thats frustrateing!!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;Any way the Law class I thought I was failing turns out Im getting eather an A or a B in acording to the teacher but I still have a handfull of work to do for that class. I have a lot of work to do for the end of the sumester and Im really really stressed My other law class I have to do really well on the final becuase I didnt do all the well on the midterm and in order to get a good grade or even pass really I need to do well. It pisses me off becuase Im always such a good student but this sumester really caught me off gaurd. (My GPA is usualy around or above 3.5) I missed my two morning classes because&nbsp; I couldnt get up I just wasnt feeling good I got up went to the bathroom and threw up then crawled back into bed till about 11:00 when I had to get up becuase I couldnt miss my 12:00 class. I still have 2 finals my psyc and law and one more question for my last Icons of power assighment as well as one more post for the first law class and I have to do the graphs for my group presentation. I dont even know when my psyc final is but I do know my law final is a week from this comeing monday. And my presentation for my other law class is this comeing thrusday and the post is due to be posted by sunday night, and the last question for my Icons of power class is due one wed. So yeah Im about to start pulling hair from my head In cant wait to be done and on summer break.<br /><br />But some good news is my mom got 2 free night in a hotel becuase she donated our broken down van to charity (It didnt have&nbsp; a reverse LOL) and one of the hotels is in Hershey park so she said that me Marni and Lanie could have it so the 3 of us are going on vacation for a weekend in Hershey I am going to start looking at what els there is to do there besides the park so that we can have more to do then just that also I need to look up what a train ride or Bus or something will caust to get there because we dont want to drive.<br /><br />Im still not feeling great Im down&nbsp;and sad &nbsp;but Im hopeing that will start to get better, I started waight watchers and though my waight is very very high I for some reason thought it would be a lot higher. hopefully takeing my meds regularly and eating right (maybe even getting on a good sleep schedual, but I wont tell David that he might try and actually make me LOL) will help out... </strong></em></font></p>"

"event","<p><font size=""3""><em><strong>Im feeling so out&nbsp; of it.</strong></em></font></p><p><font size=""3""><em><strong>Yesterday I woke up haveing a panick attack not a good way to start the day. By the time&nbsp;I was dressed I was also sobbing. My dad wound up driveing me to school because I was really not feeling well. I have just been so stressed because of the end of the sumester and all of the things that that brings, Also know I have been feeling rather clingy to everyone aspecially David, Iv been feeling so scared and lonley and I just dont want to be alone, but usualy just talking on the phone helps. I know it bothers him when I get like this and I hate takeing up his time when he doesnt want to give it, so I hate myself when I get like this. I just feel like I want to cry curl up in a ball and dissapear, sometimes I feel like I am dissapearing. Even sitting here typing this Im crying and in dont even know if I have a good reason other then Im stressed and at the end of my roap. I know things will get better when school ends and that stress is off because I know that stress effect my bipoler disorder and makes me go very depressed and sometimes very manic as well (I know it would help if I would start takeing my meds regularly again&nbsp; and I havent been to eather psyciatrist or therapist in over 6 weeks I think but I been to stressed to even deal with that)<br /><br />Saterday was grea David handled everyhing so wonderfully yet I still droped Not as bad as last time but it still sent me into a drop, last time it lasted weeks but it was worse then this so Im hopeing that I can beat this in only a few days, and as per usualy I have been haveing ok moments good moments but then I always go back to beeing really sad and scared. I been doing things to really try and keep myself up so I can get back to normal.<br /><br />Drinking slurpees chear me up also since my throught has been sore it makes it feel a lot better. I have to say that a slurpee (aspecially Pina calada) has to be my favorate treat. My dad also baught me&nbsp;a plush monkey cell phone cover for my cell phone for my birthday and as silly as that is it cheered me up because well one it was pink one of my favorite colors (blue and pink are) and monkeys which is deffinetly one of my favorite things (I love monkeys) and it felt good that my dad knew that and it cheered my up a little and the lil monkey looks so happy there on my phone it is hard not to smile when I look at it.<br /><br />I been thinking of maybe finding a spot this summer to plant sun flowers. They are my favorite flower and it would make me happy to see them growing at my house. We already have a nice pink rose bush and I think it would be nice to maybe plant the sunflower in the front (roses are by the side) it would look nice and in the front the dogs cant get at them. I think it would be a fun project to get my mind on happy things.<br /><br /></strong></em></font></p>"

"event","<font color=""#00ff00"" size=""3""><em><strong>I really had the best birthday..&nbsp;Friday Marni and Lanie took me out to dinner at the outback and then we went to see Disturbia it was a really good movie and as always the 3 of us had a really good time together. <br /><br /><br />yesterday (my actual birthday) David took me into the City and we did some shopping and then went out to eat and then to the club that we go to. <br /><br />The only thing was this jerk I ran into but I called him out on him and I let him have it I stood up for myself for ones and it felt good, David said he was proud of me for actually standing up for myself.. he has been trying to get me to do that. <br /><br />Hey but I met this really nice guy from Isreal it was a real ego boost to have someone come over to me and start up a conversation and flirt&nbsp;. I tend to be really shy so that made me feel good. Even David had to admit he liked the guy. <br /><br />David was really conserned about makeing it a good Birthday for me and he really did and that made me feel really good. <br /><br /><br />What was also really nice was when I logged on today to&nbsp; my facebook there was a bunch of messeges on my wall from my old highschool friends wishing me a happy birthday.. All and all not a bad weekend!!!</strong></em></font>"

"event","<p><em><strong><font color=""#cc99ff"" size=""2"">This has been a rollercoaster of a week.<br /><br /><br />Friday I took Marni and Lanie to the mall and then out to eat at the Outback because it was Marni's 18th Birthday. We had such a good time but we usualy do when we go out together. I always laugh so hard when we are together we are constantly cracking eachother up. And what is scary is we often read eachothers minds.<br /><br />Saterday night I cried myself to sleep at about 4 am. On top of my mom beeing in the Hospital for her knees and Marni beeing her normal self, I wasnt all to happy with David and he wasnt all to happy that I wasnt telling him why. Though in the end it did all come out, and true to form David did everything he could to make things better. Sometimes I wonder if a person can be to nice or understanding. And as always I felt better talking to him I dont know why I insist on keeping things bottled up!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />It was nice thought that Matt came and Me him my dad my uncle and Marni went out for luch it was nice. Then Matt came back to the house and we played some Texas Hold` Um. But me and Marni had this random disagrement later on, she can really be nasty some times. And that ontop of not beeing so happy with David messed with my head a little to much.<br /><br />By Sunday Marni had forgotten all about the little spat we had the night befor and lanie her and myself went off to the beach which was interesting. We took turns burrying eachother in the sand and man that sand gets stuck&nbsp; places you dont even want to know!!<br />Lanie got a pretty bad sun burn though even though we all told her to put on sunblock and she even brought it with us she just never put it on!!!!!<br /><br />But my Camera broke which was enough to send me back into beeing totaly sad and upset. Even though it is still under warenty there is no garentee that the fix will be free. but my dad said I shouldnt worry that he would make sure I had a camera even if he had to help buy me a new one if the fix on this one was too expensive.<br /><br />But it gets better. I exposed myself to something I was allergic to (Im thinking there was coco butter in the conditioner I used after the beach) so my throaght got all scratchy and closed up and swollen like I needed that on top of the stress indused hives i been getting!!! so now my alergies are acting up and i have to go to the Dr today. I really hate the Dr!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />But I got my paper back from my psyc Prof and she gave me an 87 though I forgot the abstract if I hand that in because I do have it that should bring me up to about a 90 she said. that works for me.<br /><br />Man I have been So bipoler lately!!!!<br /></font></strong></em></p>"

Though I dont really like the blogs on the other webpages so comeing here is better for that.<br /><br />Its been an interesting day, got very little sleep and then went to the hospital to visit my mom who had her knee replacement today. She was rather loopy and it was kinda funny. After that Marni and I had eye Dr apointments for our contacts it was odd and now my eyes are sort of bothering me. My parents are getting us the contacts for your birthdays. (Marni's is tomarow and mine is the 28th)<br /></em></font></p>"

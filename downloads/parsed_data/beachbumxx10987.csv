"event","hmm so it's been quite some time .. 

i don't even know whats happened it's been so long .. let's see ..

spring break came and went .. it kinda sucked cuz it was so early.

softball season is in full swing now .. i love the girls and with the exception of one little glitch we all get along, but at least we all agree on that one glitch haha.  it's not the same as last year but at least we get along quite a bit better.  i cant wait for our campoutt haha.  except we lost to freakin shawnee today so im pretty pissed off from that .. oh well.

umm lets see .. got fired/let go from work until softball is over, which really sucks because i need money badly, but oh well.

umm .. i went to three colleges last weekend- towson, shippensburg, n william paterson.  towson sucked, but it was soo much fun because bek came with me, and it's always too much fun when the two of us are together.  I loved ship, but i'm kinda too smart for there.  but they have a really good journalism department so i'm gonna keep that as a safety school in case everything else fails.  william paterson just sucked.  i really don't wanna go to school in nj, but i went just to please my dad.  it was the biggest waste of an absolutely gorgeous afternoon that i could have spend tanning.  blahh.

i think thats it .. 

41 days left til summer!!
4 months and 3 days til wildwood!!"

"event","so this has really been the week from hell.  these past few weekends, last weekend especially, have been amazing, so i should have known it was coming.

Let's see .. where to even begin? I had scrimmage 4 everys, none of which I can really remember because it was so incredibly cold this week.  I think we went 1-3.  haha yea not cool.  I think we're gonna be pretty good once we all pull together and get used to playing with each other.  At least better than last year.  Anyways, I think that softball in March should be outlawed.  The weather is absoultely ridiculous.

My grades in school SUCK.  I don't know when I decided to stop caring, but I definitely have.  Not good.  I need to finish out this year semi-strong to get the hell outta here and into college.

Work.  Blah.  I definitely need to pick up more hours (wait til later to hear why ..) and I just don't have the time.  I want a car soooooooo bad, but I don't have any time to work.  Just between softball and school alone is hard to find time to work, but soon i'm gonna have to visit more colleges and go down the shore for a few weekends.

And on to today, possibly the worst day ever.  I went into it thinking that it would be a good day .. I mean, friday, half day, it all sounded good.  Wrong.  Softball game an hour away, so I had to be back at CHS by 2:30, which kills a half day.  The game was okay, until about the bottom of the first inning when the bases were loaded.  The infield was in, and BAMB! Bomb right into my left ankle.  Yeah, it hurt.  Then we lost.  So I got home at like 6:30.  I really wanted to see my boyfriend bc i only get to see him like once a week and i miss him, :( but that just didnt work out, so i decided to have a blockbuster night with alyssa and neen.  We made it about half way down my steet when I hit a fucking parked car with my mirror.  Yeah, that was the end of that.  Thank God they didnt want to call the insurance company or anything .. now I just have to pay for two new mirrors .. one for their car, and one for mine, which leads to why i need more hours, but dont have the time to work them.  This whole fucking accident pushes back when i get my own car bc i need money, and now i have to regain the trust of my parents.  i really hope they let me out tomorrow night because I need to get out of the house and see matt.

hmm i had a lot to say.  i guess that's what happens when you're stuck at home on a friday night."

friday night i watched the notebook when i came home .. it was soo good!! i didnt cry tho .. i guess cuz i knew what was comin cuz i read the book .. 

Anyways saturday was fun .. i didnt have to work at all, so me and rob went to matt's game in the afternoon .. then i went with bek, matt, n some of his friends to some other bball game (yes, i made it thru two bball games in one day .. be proud of me!) n after that game me n bek went to visit dana at work then went back to her house .. it was funn!!

bek was just a little insane last nite .. never, ever let her have cough medicine.  I stopped the car and almost made her get out .. yeahh .. TROLL!!! ear hair .. stupid questions ..

so i had work today n then i was plannin on goin out with matt n dana .. but NOOOOOOO! it has to freakin snow ... boo!!!

oh well .. so nothing ever goes the way its planned .. at least i have tomorrow off .. i just have to write an essay, then i'll probably catch up in the oc .. woo hoo!!

"event","so i officially suck at school.

(marking period 1 + marking period 2 + exam = semester)
history- A + B + B = B
creative writing- A + A + A = A
algebra 2- B + A + B = B
spanish 4- B + B + B = B
chemistry- B + A + B = B
english- C + A + A = B

soo yea obviously the only thing I'm good at is reading or writng, and i love how everything i do is really starting to prove it. I just wish i tried first marking period so that I would have A's all across the board.  I'm really gonna work my ass off the second half of the year because it's still possible for me to get an A for the year, and I really wanna do it.

I've never seen so many B's in my life.  This is gonna kill my gpa.  Hey, no C's thought.  

Haha I didn't get sociology back yet.  There's still time.

Argg I have work every night this weekend!!!! I need somethin to do after it today tho .. too bad that there's nothing!!"

so my christmas kinda sucked.  I'm sure if i was given a car it would have been the best christmas ever, but not everyones that lucky.  For me, it was a day of spending time with people that you don't give a rats ass about.  Sad, but oh so true.

"event","I seriously hate Marlton and CHS.  School sucks, and there's nothing to do on the weekends.  The only thing that Marlton actually has is the movies .. there are like four malls nearby, but they're a pain in the ass to get to, and theres a bowlin alley down 73.  And thats it.  I can't wait to get out of here.  Yeah, it's a great place to raise kids and its safe and blah blah blah .. but its sooo dull.  And it seems like it rain almost every friday nite, so I can never drive anywhere then.  On top of this, it doesn't help that I live in the Goddamn middle of nowhere.

At least its almost Christmas break.  That'll give me 10 days to catch up on my sleep.  Last year I was a freakin insomniac.  Not only could I not sleep, but I didn't need it.  I'm definitely paying for that this year.  Sleep is the most amazing thing ever, but there's just not enough time for it.  At least not with the homework and papers I get.  Somehow I have to start and finish three papers within the next two weeks, along with all my other homework and tests.  It's definitely gonna be a tough time before break.

The worst thing about the holidays is not having a boyfriend.  I have no one that'll spend $130 on me. :( .. alright, yea thats just a little crazy, but i have no one.  I think Christmas is lonelier than valentines day.  I dunno .. they both suck.

Enough whining.  This is what rainy days do to me."

Rutgers is just too big.  It's spread out over 3 cities and you need to take a bus to get to your classes and all.  Great school and I could get into it, but its just too damn big.  And they only have a five year education program, which is my backup.

Rowan's nice, but it's too close to home.  That might be my safety school because I kno i can get into it and i like the majors.  With any major you chose, writing is emphasized which i really liked.

TCNJ.  Omg I fell in love with it .. amazing journalism program on top of everything else.  The campus is absolutely gorgeous.  I was so set on goin out of state, but this is far away enough where i'm out on my own.  I even had a squirrel jump out at me- just like at home .. If I get above a 1300 thats where i'm goin.  hah.

SAT class today .. then me and dana went shoppin!! I got my homecomin dress!! it's rly cute .. its strapless and dark purple .. it's somethin different than i thought i'd get but i rly like it .. i just gotta get rid of the flower.  Then we had a girls night out for Nicole's birthday.  Me, Nicole, Bek, Dana, and jess went bowling .. it was fun!!

Oh yeah .. I'm so effin pissed off about the whole car situation.  I understand that my parents dont want me to get my own car right away because they want me to get more experience, but theyve only let me take the car about by myself once since I got my license.  I dont kno how im gonna get experience before i get my car if they dont let me have it at all.  I kno that ive only had my license for almost like 2 weeks, but i thought i was gonna get a lil time with it.  It's really pissin me off and i got in a huge fight with them about it.  They just dont understand how hard it is to live in a town like Marlton and not have a car waiting in the driveway on my 17th birthday.  I've been handling it pretty well, but when they dont even let me use their car its gettin to me.

saturday- MY BIRTHDAY!!!

Me n bek hung out at my house for a lil .. she gave me my present!!! i love bob the healthy cow!!!! haha .. then we played nintendo and she got stared at by neen's bunny slipper n we fed alyssa's cats .. i made bek clean up the crap ..

That afternoon bek and i went down the shore .. hour n a half car ride there .. bek was on the phone with kyle n then shes like .. ""he's gotta tell ya somethin"" so i took the phone n all i hear from his is ""i'm only wearin a towel."" kinda scary.

then like the second we got in the house me n neen starting fightin lol.  but then we went out for dinner n out and around the wood.  wow- i must say that i LOVE the wood!! we got hit on n checked out by some guys .. the bus boys .. hairy scary monster!!! u cant take the chips!! random kids on the boardwalk .. we saw the funniest thing ever on the boards- there was a guy sittin on a bench wearin headphones and sunglasses singing/screaming the same song over and over again .. ""if this isn't love .. let me kno!!!"" omgg it was soo freakin funny!! Then we saw him ridin his bike down the boards singin it .. wow.  We did the go karts .. me n bek killed everyone! we kept gettin yelled at for bumpin people and cuttin people off tho .. No screamin on the go karts!!! We saw the greatest shirt .. ""If you see da police .. warn-a-brother"" .. 

then we went back to my house .. we were in the upstairs apartment n we were lookin in my fridge n bek was like ""wow ur dad rly trusts u with alcohol in the house"" n i was like ""what? theres nothin in here!!"" i was totally oblivious to the freakin 12 pack right in front of me.

kyle called us n woke us up at 1:15am to say that he saw scared because he was walkin home from his friends house n it was foggy n there was a ditch and a bunch of white people .. odd kid .. he must have called at least 55 times over the weekend .. im not kiddin either

we woke up this mornin to find it nice n sunny .. so we ate breakfast n got our swimsuits on to go to the beach .. but then we looked outside to see it all cloudy, so we decided to go for a bike ride .. we wound up on the boardwalk, which we werent supposed to be bc its pretty far from my house .. and well, three girls in the wood probably isnt the smartest idea.  At the end of the boardwalk is a shoe store that was havin a huuuuuuuuge sale .. all 3 of us got rly cute flip flops, but we had a problem .. we needed to find a way to get em home .. whatever our logic was didn't work for bek .. the bag hit the wheel n she almost flew over the handle bars .. after neen crashed in the cvs parking lot, we made it home.

By that time, the sun was out so we went to the beach .. but on the way there, neens brand new flip flop broke and she fell on the sidewalk .. amazing .. then i saw the timberweed roll by .. the beach was awesome, especially for october .. we just hung out, tanned, hand a catch, and skimboarded.  there was a really fat lady there and her flip flops started floating away so i saved one and bek saved the other and she gave bek a rly dirty look and was like ""how did my flip flop get there?"" umm duhh the freakin tide took it away u bitch!!""

It eventually got cold there so we went back to the house and took another bike ride, which was even more funfilled than the first .. the one bike that bek and neen had to take turns ridin was my mom's bike back when she was our age (haha i was too short for it) so its one of those hunch back bikes .. lets just say that they had problems with it .. bek almost got run over while ridin the death bike by some lady who called her a jerk .. neen dropped her icee a few times .. n i lost count at the number of times they fell off .. the best time bek fell was when she skimmed the curb while some guy was checkin us out.

there was some guy on the ride home n that had like bulgin eyes n was gawking at us .. scary

So now beks over n theres still time to cause some more trouble .. hell, my weekends only half over ..

2 days til my license!!!!!
i love bob the healthier cow and the wood!!!"

Omg bek: what can i say? Absolutely amazing times down the shore .. what more could we ask for? (Well .. i could think of one thing, but we'll let that go .. ) Anyways .. the waves were the best ive seen them in a few years .. incredibly rough n mostly clean.  Gettin drug under numerous times .. losing swimwear .. boogie boardin- two points for a fat person, three for a skinny person, n five if u ran em over! The sea rock .. Did u put sunblock on ur ""sensitive parts""? oh dear .. what a fun time! There are definitely some characters on the boardwalk .. the guys in the pizza place .. Bubba .. Bob .. haha.

Alyssa, neen, and i watched confessions of a teenage drama queen, which had to be one of the worst, fakest movies i ever saw.  i was at least five minutes ahead with everything that happened.  At least there was only one depressing part .. lol lys."

went bowlin last nite .. theyre renovating the place so the pool tables were gone, which didnt make me too happy.  at least i got outta the house.

i must say that i have the best summer job ever.  while some people actually have to do things while they work, my job consists of watchin tv, tanning, going online, and makin the kids lunch.  somewhere in there i gotta break up a fight or two, but i cant complain.  theyre not even home now, so im gettin paid for doin somethin that i could just as easily do at home.  wait, if i were home, neen would be online, so this actually benefits me."

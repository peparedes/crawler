"event","hello, 
      Its me again (but thats obvious), Today was short and uneventful, last night I stayed up till 6:30am with some friends, at one point we were so bored we took my home stereo system and hooked it up to my computer and then kinda just talked being bored till one of us drifted off to sleep(yeah, that was me)and because I stayed up so late I was late for school missing first period and just making it to Drama(could be why day seemed short)where we rehearsed for the upcoming play, Antigone a greek tragedy by Sophocles, which unfortionatally(or not unfortionatally) I will have graduated by the time of production meaning i wont have a part but right now its mt grade so hey, after drama was lunch which I didn't eat because I dont have any money and I dont get free lunch anymore because of being lazy and not picking up a form for it but at this point of my highschool life it would be pointless considering I will be graduating in january(hopfully)so instead of eating i went to a class room where at lot of people gather to play Chess and Collectable Card games (I.E. Magic The Gathering,DBZ and other such asundries)where I played a game of MTG and then the bell rung for the last class of the day which for me is metal shop which I spent working on a project after the last bell of the day rung I went to pick up my backpack and the zipper broke so i need i new back pack, When i got home i went over to a friends house and hung out over there till 5:00pm at which time i started writting this."

UGH! I hAD A PRETTY GOOD WEEKS THIS WEEK AND NOW IT'S RUENED!

People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit that I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I forgot all things I miss
Oh somehow I know there's more to life than this
I said it too many times
And I still stand firm
You get what you put in
And people get what they deserve
Still I ain't seen mine
No I ain't seen mine
I've been giving just ain't been gettin
I've been walking that there line
So I think I'll keep a walking
With my head held high
I'll keep moving on and only God knows why"

"event","i hate my life. i know alot of people say that but i really do! and i have for 2 years. since september of 2002. iim sure everyone knows that story, some may not belive it. but that's your problem not mine, and it's all true. i wish it wasnt but it is. :'( i wanna die soooo bad! but i cant do that to others around me. i wish i was never born. that would make everything so much easier. but im so thankful for those who care. who knows what i'd be doen if they wernt here. and you know who you are ... 

 The day i changed my name

I couldn't sleep last night
My ears were ringing in my head
Best friends with the boogie man
I may be better off here dead
Running on empty once again
Too tired for tears I dread
Sink deep into those magic dreams
While I blast off in my bed


And you know I played it all in here
Where everyone hides their darkest shades of fears
And I threw my whole night down the drain
You know cause everyone says that i'm not the same 
Since I changed my name


Three hours later and i'm staring at the ceiling still
Xanax does nothing more but calm the sleeping thrill
Turning the pillows round and round to find the cold spot for my head
Ah, bless my only friend


And you know I played it all in here
Where everyone hides their darkest shades of fears
And I threw my whole night down the drain
You know cause everyone says that i'm not the same
And everyone turns tricks for fickle fame

I feel my body's lost control
My knees get weak as I drift away
And it gets darker, darker
Dreaming's where I am


And you know I played it all in here
Where everyone hides their darkest shades of fears
And I threw my whole night down the drain


And you know I played it all in here

"event","this week has been really hard. at this point all i do is sit in my room and do nothing. and isolate myself from the whole rest of this stupid world.&nbsp;even though i'd rather be hangin out with some of my REAL friends. and all the fake ones can go rot in hell. i dont give a damn about anything anymore. i cant wait till the end of the world. cause then everything would be all better. there would be no more stupid people, no more murderers,&nbsp;no more&nbsp;people that like to hurt other people, no more people that think of only themselves. no more.&nbsp; then i see Tye again. i miss him so much. it hurts to even think about him. i wish he was still alive. everybiody is so messed up at school right now i dont know where to start. it's like drama school. ugh. i hope i dont do anything stupid to myself. it doesnt seem like josh likes me anymore, he never wants to talk. but as i said. i do care anymore. frik the world. i dont belong here. i cant wait till summer so i can go away. only 14 more dayz left. i hope i can make till then."

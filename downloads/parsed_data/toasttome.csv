 im still single, still going bald, and still working my ass off. 
 Saturday i got a card in the mail. it was from my niece in St Louis. it is an invitation to her college graduation!  geesh does that ever make me feel old! the best part of that card was that she put 'uncle' on it...i would really like to go cuz she hasnt seen me in like about 7 years, but the only way id be able to go is if my boss would get me the plane ticket!"

"event","wow i didnt realize its been months since ive posted anything on here..lol..so here goes!

 ive just been super busy with the horses. going to sales and hauling mares around. i was in LA (louisiana) for a week, then went to Ruidoso NM for a week and up in OK City for a week then last saturday i had to go back down to LA with a load of mares to drop off at the breeding farm and pick up a baby to bring back home. i hate driving on I-10! i was crusing pretty good then all of a sudden the hwy came to a dead halt. i was sitting in traffic for 2 hours cuz there was a really bad wreck and life-flight was trying to land. it was a real mess. took me forever to get back home.
 next sunday is shot day again...#97 coming up! woo hoo i really need to get me another scrip cuz i think i have 3 more shots left in the bottle i have. i was suppose to go see the doc last march but for one i didnt have the money to go and with the mares foaling and sales i just didnt have the time, but its getting down to the nitty-gritty and i need to get more drugs!
 AND its still HOTTER THAN HELL around here! what ever happened to FALL? geesh. we probably wont see fall over here and winter will be a cold ass bitch! lol
 im waiting on the tractor guy to show up and work on the tractor but i have NO clue when he is gonna show up...damn i have things to do, places to go, and people to see...he better hurry his ass up...
 well i guess thats about all for now...if i think of anything else ill get back on!"

i had a blast. my sis was really cool, using the right pronouns and all. my brother-in-law on the other hand, we had to keep correcting him. actually my sis kept getting on him saying 'its him/he'  lol...he kept saying he was old and gets confused easy..lol..he was pretty funny about the whole thing, then he finally gave up and started calling me TEX!!!!

 they took me to the race track and we saw the horses run and we went by my old high school and the house we used to live in...wow, what a step back into time! lol.

 anyways, it was great to spend time with my sister.  hope this pic turns out. its of me and my sis."

today was shot #80. geesh. ive been sticking myself for that many shots!  its a good thing i keep a calendar on my wall to let me know when i have to inject, lol...im getting older by the second, and between trying to keep up with the horses and doing my shot, i can get confused on who gets the shot!  me or the horses. lol

its all good though. right now we've got 6 new babies on the ground, 3 of them are in Louisiana and 3 are here. there's 7 more here that will be coming soon. ahhh yes it is foaling season. lots of nights staying awake and just eating everything in sight just to stay awake! you'd think id be bigger than a house by now. lol. wish there was someone here to keep me awake! hee hee hee"

"event","here i sit at 3:49am, wide awake watching a mare that is ready to foal and i got to thinking, 3yrs ago today i starting injecting myself with T. thinking back to the first shot i was scared to death to stick a needle in my leg. back then i had a g/f that i would have to have on the phone (she was a long distance g/f) while i did my shot. nowadays im back to being single, but i do have one X g/f that i talk to while doing my shot. ive also gotten to the point where i do my shots alone with no big deal, although now sometimes i forget that its 'shot day'.
 
the changes i have gone through the past 3yrs i am happy with, but there are some things that i wish could change.  ive always been stealth and nobody, not even my boss (working here for 13yrs) knows what is going on. i dont feel the need to let people know about my past. i am who i am.

in these past 3yrs ive noticed that people talk to me more no matter where i am. i dont know, it just seems that people just strike up conversations with me for no reason. i get along with all kinds of people so its easy for me. ive also noticed that i carry myself different than before T. like my posture has changed as to where i sit or walk straighter, if that makes any sense. lol...im not a very big guy, 4'11, 100+ lbs. & 54yrs old, but its all good. i try to make the most of what ive got! ive also found myself eating more red meat...i have to have a steak or sometimes 2 in one day! really weird. and its just steak, nothing else to go with it except maybe mashed potatoes.
i work out 3 times a week but i dont think i need to do anymore than that cuz working with horses everyday IS a workout! lol.

i guess im done rambling for now. i really need to get some sleep. tomorrow is going to be a busy day here with the horses.

till next time."

next month in fact will be 3yrs and i have still yet to grow hair on my left shoulder!!!
i just got done doing my shot and it always seems like i have to eat something afterwards. its like im starving to death. so i had gone to the grocery store and bought $50 worth of steaks and i think since its nice but cold out im gonna BBQ me up a steak. 
 last week i had taken 3 horses up to OK City for the sale. it was really bad up there with all the snow and ice. i was there for 5 days and it was nasty cold with sleet and snow. when i left on Sunday they were calling for another 3 to 8 inches of snow! i left out of there early and caravaned home with 2 other horse transports. the roads were slick with ice and i had 2 mares and a 3day old baby in the trailer. man it was scary.
 last thursday i ended up hauling 5 mares to Louisiana to the breeding farm. that was one hell of a trip! i think the only horse in the trailer that was not having a happy trip was the baby! at least the roads were dry and the sun was out. i left at 5:30am and got back here around 5pm.
 these past few days im keeping an eye on one of the mares here that is ready to foal. she should have her baby in a couple of days. oh joy, this is foaling season where im awake ALL NIGHT LONG! 
 well i better go out and feed, they all act like they havent eaten in months...damn horses, its sunday and i dont feel like doing a damn thing! lol"

 this next week is gonna be busy. i have to get the truck and horse trailer ready to go to OK City for the horse sale, move the 2 pregnant mares that are fixing to foal to another ranch so they can be watched while im out of town, get the farrier over here to put shoes on the 3 sale horses, bathe and clip the sale horses, get a trailer of hay put in the barn, geesh i could go on and on but it looks like im gonna be working my little ass off (what little i have left!) as busy as im gonna be i just hope i dont forget to do my shot before i leave for OK!"

 today i had another checkup. doc said im doing really good. lab work was good and i had gained 4 1/2 lbs since my gall bladder surgery. got another script and also got a script for some lunesta. ive been having a hard time sleeping at night so now ill be able to sleep, well ill have to wait till after the mares foal to be able to get a good night sleep anyways.  my doc also asked me if i wanted to start using the gel and i said that i didnt want to because i dont know if the gel would transfer to the horses i guess thats something i need to check into. then doc asked me if i wanted to go on a lower dose than 200mg and i said no cuz i think im doing just fine with what ive been doing and i just want to stay with whats been working. like they say, if it aint broke dont fix it!  now if i could only come up with some money for surgery ill be just fine.

 as for the holidays, well thats another story.  for me it was just another day. i sure hope the new year will be better for me. im just tired of being alone."

 not much new is going on with me. last sunday i did shot # 73 (2yrs-9months worth). i HAVE noticed that since my gall bladder surgery, ive gained some weight! which is about time. ive been feeling pretty good, and i can eat anything and usually everything!!! i need to go get some bloodwork done this month also.

   on another note, my 'so-called girlfriend' (the bi-polar one) came over the other night. we sat and watched tv and ate ice cream then went to bed. for some reason, i always sleep better when shes in my bed!!  now i probably wont hear from her for another 2 weeks, thats just how it goes. ill spend time with her, then she leaves and i dont hear from her for awhile or when she deceides she wants to see me. i wish i could just find someone to spend all my time with, not just 1 or 2 days out of the month with. 

 its been raining here for the past couple of days and this morning at 4am i had to run out to the barn and close the doors. then i heard water dripping in my closet!!  yep, my ceiling is leaking...i had to go back out to the barn and get some buckets to catch the water dripping in my closet!! i also had to move a bunch of my clothes so they wouldnt get wet... i am not a happy camper this morning. guess im just gonna stay in the house today cuz i sure dont want to go out and play in the mud!

  later today im gonna do another shot. # 63 i believe. 

 another thing im ticked off about is that the other day when i went to the bank, the drive thru window, the guy in there was talking to the girl that was cashing my check and i could tell he was talking some shit cuz he would put his hand in front of his face and his lips were moving and that girl would look straight at me. he was really pissing me off, so i used the 'call button' after i got my money, and i told him that i could read lips!!!!  fucking punk, i just wanted to kick his ass."

 anyways, next sunday is Christmas.....wooo hooo, big deal. to me its just another day. ill probably just be here again working. these damn horses dont know what a day off is or what holidays are. i need to train them to feed themselves!!!! lol...

 on another note, my 'X' told me tonight that she had gotten a card in the mail from somebody, (the card was not signed) and in the card was a check for $1000.!!!!!   she asked me if i had sent it. i had her guessing there for a minute but i had to come clean and tell her that, no i didnt send it, but now she can buy a plane ticket to come down here.
ive been trying to get her down here but she always comes up with some excuse why she cant. tonight she told me that shes really thinking about it. (im not getting my hopes up but it would be nice to see her again)

"event","well yesterday was a bit hectic over here. a 10 month old filly had cut her leg on a feeder and it was really bad. she had cut an artery and blood was just spurting out everywhere. i tried to clean it up and put a wrap on it so i could take her to the vet. she had lost ALOT of blood. i backed the trailer into the barn to load her up but she didnt want to get in the trailer. we took our time with her and she was just a real bitch. she kept rearing up and slinging her head. well she had reared up and slammed her head as hard as she could and while she was up in the air she slammed her head on top of a stall and then fell to the ground. i knew when she hit the ground she was dying. she was having seizures and blood was coming out of her nose. the hardest thing was just watching her take her last breath and me being helpless. she was a really nice filly.  

 i had to call the boss lady and tell her about it and of course she was pissed. more pissed at ME cuz she called it a 'maintaince' problem and that i should have removed that feeder a long time ago. boss lady said she was NOT happy at all. well ya know, i had told her months ago that the feeder was bad, but she didnt want to spend the money to buy a new one. well now look what happened.   she had me so upset, im ready to tell her to kiss my lily white ass and find her some other idiot that will work for her. 

 then last night around 10:30pm there was somebody banging the hell out of my front door!!!  turned out to be the cops!  scared the shit outta me. turns out the mexican guy that works for me was having a fight with his wife and she called the cops.  there was 3 cop cars here!! talk about being paranoid!!! lol...i had smoked a joint about 20 mins before the cops got here and i also have a plant growing (about 3 feet tall). the cops were here for about 2 hours, then the old fat nosey lady across the road just had to come up here to see what the hell was going on. i didnt talk to her but i saw her driving off with her lights out on her truck...well about 3 mins after she got home she called me and wanted to know what was happening. i bluntly came out and told her ""well you were just here werent you? its a private matter!""  that women just boils my blood.

 ok i guess i ranted long enough!!!!!!! lol"

"event","yesterday i went to the support group winter meeting. i had a blast! although there were more MTF's there than us FTM's...'we' were out numbered again. it was like 25 to 5...i usually leave the meetings early but this time i stayed till it was over and a bunch of us went out to eat afterwards. i think one of the women was hitting on me! i dont know.
at these meetings we all get up, 1 by 1 and tell about our journeys. well she had gotten up and was telling about how she had changed jobs and that one day a co-worker walked up to her and asked if they could ask her a personal question. she was like.. oh no, here we go. but the co=worker asked if she had breast augmentation!!. so at the break of this meeting some of us go outside and well i was outside with some of the guys and their girlfriends and she had come outside too. i walked up to her and asked her if ""I"" could ask her a personal question! (i was just joking with her) so i asked her if ""they"" were real!   LOL...well she then took my hand and put it on her chest and said ""Hell yeah, theyre real!""  LOL...i was speechless there for a few minutes..ME speechless!!!!  anyways, later she went out to dinner with us. there was about 6 of us that went out to eat.  when we were all leaving she gave me a hug and i mean she made sure she pressed herself up against me!!!! 
 i dont know how to deal with this, i mean, ive always been with bio females. i consider myself hetero male and well, she really threw me for a loop. im not sure how i feel about being with a MTF. dont get me wrong, i think she is really cute and if i didnt know any better id automatically think she was a bio female. i dont know, i guess its just all in my mind."

MTF's as well as FTM's.  theres usually more MTF's there than FTM's but we all get to talk about different things. then we all get separated, FTM's in one room and we talk about current issues with our transistion.

 i started to drive back on saturday morning around 4am. (takes at least 12 hours to get back home) but i was like 6 hrs from home and i started feeling sick, (damn stomach) so i pulled into a rest area somewhere in Abliene i think and just puked my guts out till i felt better. then i got back into the truck and got past a little town called De Leon and had to pull over again...this time it was not good. i pulled in there somewhere around 3pm and really got sick. my cell phone wouldnt let me call out...who invented these damn things if they dont work when ya need them to?  LOL...anyway, my ""x"" from WA got through to me and i told her that i had been on the side of the road for a couple of hours now puking, she inturn called my boss, and then she called 911 and they got ahold of the sheriff in the town i was in and next thing ya know, an ambulance pulled up next to my truck!!  (damn, i still love that 'x' of mine!) needless to say, i was transported to the hospital in a town in the middle of 'bum-fucked egypt'. they hung fluids on me, did an EKG, ultrasound of my stomach, x-rays of my stomach, and pulled blood...
 diagnosis is : you have ulcers AND gall stones which means you NEED to have your gall bladder removed ASAP~!!  i was freaking out. anyway, i told them that i was not a 'local' and that i needed to get the truck and horse trailer back home and that i would have a dr. here take it out. i ended up leaving the hospital with all the copies of shit they did to me and my boss's friend (who is publisher of Track Magazine) put me up in a motel and he had his secretary get the truck and trailer and drop it off at the motel for me. i finally made it back home sunday afternoon around 6 or so.  what a fucking trip!!!!  im suppose to be leaving again for another sale on the 30th but the boss lady told me that she doesnt want me to go on this trip and she told me to TRY and not get another attack until she gets back so i can go into the hospital!!  but if i get sick again she knows ill be going via ambulance or whatever before she gets back...
  hows that for a damn update!!!!  LOL"

In Kentucky, a group of 3rd, 4th and 5th graders, accompanied by two female teachers, went on a field trip to the local racetrack (Churchill Downs) to learn about thoroughbred horses and the supporting industry (Bourbon), but mostly to see the horses.
When it was time to take the children to the bathroom it was decided that the girls would go with one teacher and the boys would go with the other. The teacher assigned to the boys was waiting outside the men's room when one of the boys came out and told her that none of them could reach the urinal.
Having no choice, she went inside, helped the boys with their pants, and began hoisting the little boys up one by one, holding onto their ""wee wees"" to direct the flow away from their clothes. As she lifted one, she couldn't help but notice that he was unusually well endowed. Trying not to show that she was staring, the teacher said, ""You must be in the 5th grade.
"" No, ma'am, "" he replied.   ""I'm the jockey riding High Fly in the Derby""

 i was surprised yesterday to find a letter in my mailbox (snail mail) from my Aunt,my moms sister, who is a catholic nun... back in Dec. i had finally wrote and told her of what i was doing with my life and how i am alot happier and that i have been living a life of Hell. anyway i got to finally tell her and it took a load off of me...but i just hadnt heard from her and i thought well, i guess i really gave her a shock or something. my family, whats left of it, are not a close knit family, my Aunt, lives in CT, and is somewhere i think in her 70's, my sister 4yrs older than me lives in IL, and i also have a 1/2 sister which i hardly know, that is in her 20's and living somewhere in PA, and i live here in TX, so its not like we get together very often. the last time i saw ANY of my relatives was back in 2002 when my grandma died, and she was 101!!!  geesh i dont want to live THAT long....anyway in my Aunt's letter she told me she was glad i finally told her what was going on but she said it is very difficult to change K**** to Jean-Paul...she said that mom had never said anything to her but that my mom worried about me all the time... (my dad dis-owed me when i was 16 & moved me out of the house) then she tells me she's happy for me, THEN she starts her ""I'll be praying for you"" thing.!  

  all in all the letter was a good one, i think, she is also retiring from teaching and is moving into a retirement home...i dont know if thats a good thing or not...i guess there is a special home for old nuns, (i dont mean to make that a funny)

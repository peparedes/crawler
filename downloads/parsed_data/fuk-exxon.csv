"event","Well I'm back from alaska.  It was fun, but damn I'm tired.  It was beautiful up there.  The weather cool, but not cold, and it was sunny almost the entire time.  I would have liked more rain and colder weather, but it would probaly not gone well with the things we wanted to do.  We saw lots of wildlife, fished, and generally spent a large amount of the time drunk.  The wierdest thing was the 4.8 earthquake that hit anchorage while we were sleeping thursday morning. I also saw a guy try to surf the tidal bore, which I know may not make much sense, but if you know what a tidal bore is, you know the guy was a little nuts.  After seeing it, I do believe I may try moving there someday.  

BTW, I didn't bring any fish back for sushi like planned.  Considering how the fish we caught was handled and processed, I don't think I would want to use it for sushi.  Sorry"

"event","Well this is nice.  Just found out two hotels in my area have been held up at gunpoint. We probaly shouldn't have a problem here as we are covered pretty well by cameras, and the robbers seem to be doing thier homework and avoiding places with good security systems.  I just hope they don't bother us, as I don't really feel like being held up at gunpoint again.  Hmm, come to think of it, its been just a few days over a year since the last time."

It kinda sucks though because Jeri is leaving for Michigan to see her family just as I come back, and then her friends want her to go to South Padre as soon as she gets back from that.  3 weeks without her is really going to suck."

"event","well I tried it out tuesday night.  It was decent, but I still think haiku has better sushi.  It did have some rather unique dishes though. Overall a good addition to places to get sushi in this town. 

Side note though, almond green tea tastes wierd.  I think next time I'll stick with something a little more normal."

"event","In every confrontation, there are events leading up to the first attack, the outright declaration of war.  Often times, both sides of the conflict can see trouble brewing on the horizon, but in the hope of peace, choose to remain indifferent.  At times, this can be the route less fraught with danger, and will sometimes even lead to a cease of hostilities before outright war has ever been considered. Peace can reign, and all can rejoice. But sometimes, war may be unaviodable. One side may gain more power, and because of this believe they cannot be apposed.  They will begin to use this power to suppress thier fellows, or perhaps even destroy them. At this piont the opposition must band together to destroy the tyranny, or simpy accept it and live in terror under the tyrants rule. Of course there is always the chance the tyrant can be reasoned with and peace would once again reign. But there is also the chance that once one side has taken power, they will relish in it, and lord it over others, saying ""oppose me and you shall be destroyed"". When this point has been reached, the opposition, while not incapable of rising up in defiance, has had its power to defend itself seriously damaged, if not eliminated. They are no longer strong, and can be easily picked off one by one. If only they had taken action when they saw first saw the danger coming. If only they had worked to weaken the oppositions power base, or perhaps even performed an outright attack, a pre-emptive strike if you will, and destroyed the one who would soon be an enemy.  But how are they to know if those courses of action would have lead to a better future?  Destroy the monster, and a new one, perhaps one unknown of at the time, would take its place. Or perhaps the blow would be deflected, and the resulting rampage of the wounded beast would destroy all. Peace, war, freedom, oppression.  Any action taken or not could result in good or evil. So in the end, how does one decide the correct path?"

"event","I thought i wrote on here like couple months ago... but the date almost goes back a whole year.  Shows how life is flying by! Speaking of.. I'm about to be 21 years old...damn it! I haven't acheived anything I wanted  to... one thing is not having kids WOO HOO! I'm like the only chick in texas that does not have a child. It feels good to know that, :)

Anyways How's yall's life in Arizona? I was actually supposed to come down this weekend to grab my mom's furniture BUT like always she never answers the phone, therefore we are not comming down.  I always think why not just move to AZ? i mean thats what i always wanted to do becuase i have great friends there and I'm pretty sure its alot safer to drive drunk.  BUT people change and you kinda get stuck whereever you are no matter if you enjoy it or not.  I always think what my life would be like if i were to live there, I do see me smiling more and make friends alot easier.  (austin is full of wacked stuck up people and wanna be everything their nots) But lets not talk about that becuase no matter how bad i want to move there, I'm not. *shrugs* one day I will realize.. but now I'm just going to live here with a pretty good full time job that pays well, waste 40 hours a week for the rest of my life until its too late to realize I'm 32 and not had a chance to experience the shit I wanted to...

life does suck and who ever things vica versa, screw you lucky bastards."

I still live in Austin... thats basically it.

I haven't been to any shows here for 2 years other than RANCID, partly becuase nothing good ever really comes through Austin. But this weekend, I saw TERROR, COMEBACK KID, and GORILLA BISCUITS. Gorilla biscuits are fucking amazing. I got my ass kicked by FAT Texas boys...but of course i kicked it right back. 

I miss Arizona.

I know i keep changing my mind about where i want to live and shit. but I was really thinking alot about this and I think im going to go with it.
Since I have no acceptance to any colleges here..becuase i havent signed up.. and my dad isnt helping me much.. I think its time for me to do what i always wanted to to...

MOVE TO ARIZONA....with my mom for a while, go to TCC for at least 2 years... get my own apartment or share with someone*...but that someone wants to move to california... Anywho...Im really excited. I can't wait to be where i love being... and seeing my great friends.

Even though he didn't want to go and i didn't force him, he took me to the Trail Of Lights down town. its where this street is lit up with lights and they have this big ass light that is in a shape of a christmas tree. we were under it and if you look up, its like swirls of lights and Shane and I swung in circles and got all dizzy. it was fun, but the thing was it was cold as hell, so they had this huge bond fires big as a bedroom with huge logs. it was so fun.

"event","dood. my dad sucks ass. He isn't the same anymore. Remember alex when my dad use to be cool and have the time to take me places and just have a father-daughter time? well, that was all ruined when my fucking 23 year old step mom moved with us. I swear alex if you only knew her, you'd die. 

I ease dropped on thier conversation 2 nights ago. I finally understand why my dad hasn't been the same. My step mom controlls him. She lectured (or tried cuz she can't speak correctly) him about how bad we are and wanting my sister to move out. that is why i realized He's been trying to kick my sister out. He would never do that untill that bitch moved here. I over heard him say to her ""I know, they were never this bad."" what the fuck. I come home everyday after school, I don't go anywhere on school nights like he said, I kept his word all the time. Its like he doesn't pay attention to us. ugh its soo agravating. thats why i want to go to college so i can start my own life and get the fuck away from them. what can i do to make my dad realize? I do try to talk to him about this and he gets so mad and he can't even hold a conversation with me anymore. ..."

He calls me yesterday, saying that hes looking for houses in Austins colony (my neighborhood)  and i was like OH? thats my neighborhood, and he goes oh ""well, im on the street Menifee"" and i was like ""OHHH.. thats my road.."" and he  was like ""well, im looking at this house about the 3rd last house on the street"" and im like "".... thats right in front of my house."" he was like well, do oyu think i can stop by and chat with you? and i was lie sure whatever i didn't think too much of it so we chatted, and he was like ""DON'T TELL ANYONE, BUT EVERSINCE I MET YOU LAST TIME, I HAD A CRUSH ON YOU(this guy is like 28-35)"" im like woah.. and he asked me if i liked him i said as a friend.! and he gave me a hug was said that i had a nice back because he can feel my muscles and wanted me to flex my arm for him..i think he knew that i was freaked out and so i went inside..

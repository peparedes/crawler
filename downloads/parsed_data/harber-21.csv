Boy: ( cutting her off ) ugh i'm so mad
Girl: why? whats wrong ?
Boy: ugh everything
Girl: explain baby
Boy: just lost a championship game,
parents flipped out on me for no reason,
and im catching a cold
Girl: well hey there will always be other games,
you know ill take care of you when your sick,
what your parents flip about ?
Boy: they are making me pay them for a car repair
Girl: is it alot of money
Boy: no it just sucks
Boy: but hey i dont feel well im going to go lay down
Boy: bye
Girl: wait i want to give you some...
Boy: cant it wait til tommorow ?
Girl: yeah sure
Girl: bye
Boy: bye


2 hours later a friend of hers asks her to go for a drive ...she goes.....

her friend swerved to avoid a truck....hitting a tree instead

her friend was killed instantly....shes in critical condition


This is the conversation between her sister and her boyfriend

Sister: omg ( crying )
Boy: what? whats wrong ?
Sister: my sister...your gf was involved in a major car wreck
Boy: is she ok ? ?????
Sister: shes in critical condition
Boy: i'll be there in 10 minutes


He shows up to the hospital room ...standing outside the door
going over the last conversation in his mind over and over as he
heard the machines beep and beep and breathing tubes pump


Boy: she wanted to give me something or tell me something
Girls mom: yeah this...

it was an envelope smelling like she did sealed with a kiss in lipstick

he opened it.....

it said ..... your everything to me....i love you with everything i am
and everything i have...i want to spend the rest of my life with you

sealed in it was a ripped movie ticket from the first movie they went to

and the first picture they took together

he kissed the picture as a tear fell from his face onto the picture

it looked as if in the picture she was crying

then the machines flatlined....3 minutes later she was pronounced dead


If you have any heart...any soul...or want to be happy you will repost this.
if you care for someone ...do not let something like this ever happen

Post this in the next 200 seconds and you WILL have THE best

day of your life THIS SATURDAY. You're number one *love* Will

either kiss you, ask you out, or call you or better. If

you break this chain you will have a lousy day on Saturday, and

you know you can

much love to all lol

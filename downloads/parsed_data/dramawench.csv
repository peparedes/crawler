"event","A couple of weeks ago when I was at the Virginia-Highlands Summerfest, I bought a photograph of a sign from a bar in Nice. The sign had one of my favorite Shakespearean quotes, so it had to be mine. I've been looking at that photograph every day and it reminded me how much I love that quote. 

SO. I decided to make some icons out of it. I found these amazing backgrounds by <A HREF=""http://kiho-chan.deviantart.com/art/85-random-icon-textures-119905042"">Kiho-chan on Deviant Art</a> and went to town.

"event","<lj user=""dramawench""> and <lj user=""biftec""> here. We just need to say a few things.

<lj-cut text=""Here there be spoilers, mateys. And massive dorkiness. Beware."">

Aly: HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a fantastic episode! We got some fantastic character moments across the board (hello, Pam, volleyball champion!!), some awwwwws, some massive laughs, some very uncomfortable Michael moments. And now we know what a truly gifted actor John Krasinski is.

Beth: Okay, I'm going to go ahead and say this right now. This is exactly what I did NOT want to happen on this show. HOWEVER. John Krasinski just sold this entire storyline for me, if they do it as wonderfully as the last two minutes of this episode. OMG. TEARS. THE TEARS AND THE SMILES AND THE FREAKED OUT FACE AND THE HUGS AND OOOOOOMMMMMMMGGGGGG!!! Um, there was other stuff going on too. Just let me catch my breath a minute.

Aly: What I loved most was them letting this be a private moment for Jim and Pam. Granted, it's also a giant HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA SUCKERS moment for the audience, but still. It let this be just for them, which had to help John. WITH THE TEARS. AND THE SMILES AND FREAKING OUT AND THE TEARS OMG I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. Ahem.

Beth: You know, Aly, the first take of the proposal was actually without sound.

Aly: Why yes, Beth, I do remember that! Well played, Office staff, in remembering that beautiful moment and recapturing it here.

Beth: Indeed, Aly. And a nice little nod to those of us who are dorky enough to find ""director's cuts"" of scenes online.

Aly: So true, Beth. Truer words have ne'er been spoken.

Beth: Meanwhile, we had to watch the Stanley talking head about forty times in a row because it was JUST THAT AWESOME.

Aly: ""I don't often enjoy theater, but that was delightful!"" OMG, I seriously almost wet my pants. Well played, Leslie. Well played indeed. SO many little moments like that in this episode and actually through the last 6 episodes. I was starting to think that the show had taken a bad turn with Charles and Michael getting fired, but it spawned a really fantastic second half of the season.

Beth: I'd have to agree with you there, Aly. (Don't you love how we are totally turning this into some sort of freakish sports commentary, only about The Office?) I actually really loved the whole Michael Scott Paper Company storyline, and on paper it seemed awful. But they used it to create some amazing insights into these characters, and I am officially sold on these writers being able to pull anything off. EVEN PREGNANCY.

Aly: I'm completely with you, Beth. I'm really interested to see where they take this whole BABY storyline. OMG BABY. Whew, okay, bringing it back. They set up a lot of potential storylines in this episode, which is what a good season finale should do. Not just cliffhangers, but interesting tidbits that make you want to see where it is going to go.

Beth: Absolutely. So Aly, what are your wishes for the coming season, seeing what we've seen tonight and in the past few weeks? For me, it is more character development for Jim (OMG, Philly Jim come back!! You have a baby on the way now!!), more insight into the Michael that actually seems to have a little bit of self-control (thank you for not attacking Holly while you were rolling in the grass, because I would have had to leave the room in embarrassment for you), and OMG can we please see some Kelly/Andy action??

Aly: I definitely am with you on all of those points, ESPECIALLY Michael with self-control. Those Michael in charge moments have been some of my favorites over these past few eps (Michael giving Pam the talk while she was freaking out in the car? Amazing!) I also really love Erin and hope she gets to stick around. And I love the potential of more Dwight and Angela, that whore :) But mostly I'm going to be waiting to see if the writers live up to the responsibility of not ruining my favorite couple on TV.

Beth: Agreed. And now, as there is a storm raging outside and we are officially crossing into ""risking our lives"" territory by typing this, we should wrap it up with one final, superficial wish for the coming season. Mine will be for Ryan to always always have blond hair.

Aly: I'm going to have to go with Andy singing more on the show. MORE BANJO.

Beth: And now, this is Beth and Aly, signing off. And running away from the dangerous electronics.

Dear god, it's exactly CSI. CSI Atlantis.

Oh John, you are so tortured. And gay. 

Pauli Walnuts!!! Though I doubt most SGA fans watched the Sopranos. They have given him wretched dialogue.

This whole ep feels like it's trying way too hard - to be serious, to be edgy. It's turning out just kinda boring.

Yes, of course the Wraith would be playing poker.

John is supposed to be all burnt-out and laconic, but Joe just looks kinda bored.

Wow, the music choices. I just...wow. Trying SO HARD.

Ahhh, Area 51. Of course McKay is working there. Damn, DHew looks hot in that suit.

And he's even hotter when he's all in charge. David? Not phoning it in.

See John be sarcastic and laconic. Snark, John, snark.

""Not really a fan."" We know, Joe. 

Ugh. I hate that I am forced to watch these WWE commercials.

Ahahahaha - Todd is a poet! So much love. Christopher Heyerdahl also giving it his all.

Mmm, hello, David Nykl. Nice suit :) I touched you and recommended grits to you! He and David play so well off each other, always.

David's hair is looking stranger the longer I look at it.

Awww, look at Rodney trying to fix John!!!! ""I will make out with you if I have too!""

Johnny Cash, ""Solitary Man"". OH HAI, I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE.

Connect those dots, John. Oh god, he's gonna die, isn't he? He's going to sacrifice himself, to redeem things.

Hello, Walter! Poor guy, I'm sure you needed the work.

Oh, John, not your car! Your only possession! OH THE METAPHOR!

Machine gun fire NOT GOOD, SHEPPARD. EEP. 

Wow, the gun fire from the fighter plane was strangely anti-climactic. 

""He could be in a lot of trouble right now."" Gee, you think, Rodney?

I knew it!!!! He died saving people and yet somehow they still made it a kind of a stupid sacrifice. It's like, ""yeah, he saved us but only a little bit.""

THAT'S IT????? You fuckers. God, it's like the writers just gave up. What does that small rip mean? Is something more going to come through? Is real Sheppard going to know what happened? Way to leave everything hanging.
</lj-cut>

Just like with ""Identity"", the kind of episode we have been waiting YEARS to get and when we see it, practically every fanfic writer in the fandom has done it better. Overall, not really a bad ep, but it's sad when canon suffers in comparison to fanfiction.

I wonder if I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't had such high expectations for it. I know I'll rewatch it, so maybe it will be better the second time."

"event","My boss and I have Picture Book Exchange Day on most Fridays - we each bring a book from our collection that we think the other would like. It's great, because I'm discovering some great new books. 

It gave me an idea: everyone has their favorite books from when they were a kid and lots of them people aren't familiar with. So I'm going to link to 3 of my favorites, with a short description, and I want you to link to 3 of yours in the comments. That way we can all start a great collection of picture books!

My list:

<a href=""http://s14.photobucket.com/albums/a332/lyssa80/entries/?action=view&current=anatole.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a332/lyssa80/entries/anatole.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a><A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Anatole-Cat-Eve-Titus/dp/037583902X/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&coliid=I3KT8EVXI2JV21&colid=3TZTJDINDRDJX""><b>Anatole and the Cat</b></a>
Anatole is the happiest, most contented mouse in all of Paris. He is Vice-President in charge of Cheese Tasting at Duvall's cheese factory. He works in secret at night--the people at Duvall have no idea their mysterious taster is really a mouse! So M'sieu Duvall thinks nothing of bringing his pet cat to the factory...

Clever Anatole must act to protect his job, and his life! He must do what no mouse has done before--find a way to bell the cat. Bonne chance, Anatole!

The Little Mouse has a Big, Strawberry and tries to keep the Big Hungry Bear from eating it! He tries locking it up, hiding it, but the Bear might still be able to find it. What's the key? Sharing it with a friend!

He tries to get the other animals agree to just let him eat them, but it takes a clever rabbit and his tasty carrot stew to solve the problem!"

For 3 people who basically decided overnight to form a theater company, this seems so surreal. We've put up 4 shows in 2 years and have apparently garnered a following. We've worked our fingers to the bone, and created something really special. PUNK THEATER, BABY!!!

So thanks to everyone who has either been in a show, is on our board (yes, we have a board of directors. Ahhh!), has helped backstage, or has just told us that we weren't crazy for doing this. We could not have done this without all of you!

Yes, that's right. 99x is going cease to be. Leslie Fram and Steve Craig quit, or were fired, depending on which report you believe, and top 40 pop station Q100 will be moving over to the stronger signal.

I can't tell you how upset and pissed I am about this. I have been listening to 99x since it switched from Power 99 in the early 90's. It formed my love of rock and introduced me to artists I never would have heard otherwise. 

The station is going to try to become a ""visual radio station"" - 99x.com. I guess they are going to stream exclusively online. Which I guess is better than nothing.

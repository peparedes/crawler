I've thought this a million times, but never really said it...My life can be compared to the movie or book Fight Club, before Tyler Durden becomes introduced.  I am buying a new entertainment unit for my room...It's the same thing as what I have now, except black.  I am also buying a new dresser and fouton.  This has taken a long time to get done, but it will happen soon.   I want to buy an Ipod and digital camera too.  I have a car.  I will have a license soon, provided I pass the fucking test.  Anyways I'm out."

In the past few days, particullary the past 24 hours, my life has really changed.  It's like I have no hope, and no matter how hard I try nothing will ever work out for me.  This goes far beyond girls, other shit that comes and goes.  These past few days will have it's impact on the rest of my life.  There isn't much to do anymore, except think and hopefully come to terms.  I think I am in serious danger of losing all who are close to me.  I don't know if it's becuase I've become so bitter, or if I'm just annoying or what.  I do know that lately no one wants anyting to do with me.  Since summer started I've gotten one call to hang out.  And then those plans were broken for some stupid reason.  But it's a week into summer, and I've gotten one call.  I'm begining not to care how I spend my day, because it really doesn't matter.  Whether I'm sitting in my room watching movies, or out, it seems like I'm still miserable and so is everyone else around me.

"event","I have been finding myself mroe and more intrigued by things that aren't normally something I would find interest in.  For example, certain girls.  Like I have been looking at girls who aren't exactly pretty but not ugly either.  I have found myself more and more attracted to intelligence.  Maybe the word I am looking for isn't intelligence, but it certiantly is stupidity either.  I have been thinking about this kind of stuff a lot, and I've come to a conclusion.  I want my next girlfriend to fit most of this discription if not all.  I know this might sound a little superficial right now, but I'm sure when the list is over, I would sound like such an ass. 

Needs to be smart, and not lazy. -  What I mean by this, is just needs to be able to havea  converstaion with me, but I am really attracted to hardworkers who can do what they need to do, and do it well.  I don't know why.  But I am most attracted to the fact that they put forth and effort towards something.  Also, I feel that I am fairly smart and hardworking.  

Funny, in a cute kind of way. - There is nothing on this world I love more about a girl, than when she makes a cute joke and looks at you with confidence that you will find humor in it.  I don't know why, but I really really like a girl who can do that.  Whether she achieves this by making a smart-ass remark, or by insulting something, or just by making a funny observation.  I don't know it's something I really find attractive.

When I talk about hardcore I want her to laugh and call me a dork. - Too many girls wouldn't know how to handle a conversation about hardcore.  It's not like I'm being sexist, but from past experiences the girls I've met that know anything about hardcore aren't really for me, they are more like friends.  HOWEVER I do want this girl to have opinions, fairly educated opinions on subjects like politics, society, and even music.  I enjoy a good conversation on something that is arguable, but I do not enjoy arguing.  

Maturity - Needs to have, but also needs to be mature enough to understand that there are times that call for immaturity.  

Open Mind - Towards almost anyhting.  Also with this open mind, I would like her to have past expericnes to share with me, to maybe teach me a little more. I have a fairly open mind as well, and I would love to share ideas with someone else. 

Observations - She needs to know her surroundings, and be able to talk about them.  I don't mind complaing, as long as it's not taken too the point where there is no positive talk about anything in thier life.  I can't deal with complaining 100 percent of the time.

Cute - needs to be all around cute.  Cute personalty, cute apperance (which for me is mostly decided by the personatly).  Cute jokes, cute laugh, comforting smile.  That is basically the most superficial part of the requirements I think.



So I think putting something like this in my live journal may not be the best way to get this kind of girl.  Setting requirments and stuff.  Like I said though, they don't have to meet every 'requiremnt' but if they did that would deffinatly be my dream girl.  Provided she is loyal, but I am a pretty good judge of loyality.  But in retrospect, these ahve always been something I've looked for in girls, and I've thought I've found them everytime I got involved with a new girl.  I guess it was just the way they protreyed themselves.  For the most part they turned out to be selfish, and decietful.  Maybe I'm not as good of a judge of loyality as I beleive myself to be.  We all make mistakes.  Misjudgements, maybe we pass judgement, but whatever.  That type of thing happens to everyone and I don't feel I am different from anyone else in my 'woman department' I mean we all have similar experiencse, I think I have a different perspective and attitude towards mine than most people do.  But I don't know it's been a long year so far, and it's only getting longer.

My parents yelled at me because I didn't get paid for 3 hours that I worked, my work left it off of my paycheck or something.  That started a big fight.  I have to go to work in 12 hours, and I haven't really slept in roughly 38.  This break has been a bust.  Totally, shit hasn't been goin' on at all.  This town is fucking terrible...or maybe it's just our imaginations...but I end up sitting at a fast food place everynight, wasting my money and getting fatter.  I have kind of been boucning around this whole break though, my parents don't really want me home...except before work.  I have slept here most of the nights so far though.  I am so fucked in so many ways.  I don't know why, but I can't get a grip on life, and I constantly worry.  All I do is fucking worry.  There is no reason for it....I have said this so many times before, but the only time I am at peace is during sleep.  Otherwise, I'm awake and paranoid....granted I do have good times...but that's inbetween being paranoid and disgusted.  But the majority of the digust I feel is towards my self. We all do stupid shit though.  It must be nice to be free or paranoia.  It would be the one thing I would change about my life, but I really can't.  So I'm just trying to accept it.  I am a trusting person though. I don't think enough people realize this.  I also don't really try to give peopel shit when I talk to them.  This shit will all improve.

Like it's not like I'm really depressed, I'm just pissed off because of how stupid and contradicting some people can be.  How they have these great opinions at first, but then thier minds become adulterate and they fucking lose site of what is right, and in turn, fuck themselves and everyone around them. I guess maybe in time maturity will play a roll in your life and you might not be so dumb.  Or maybe your life and the way you were brought up makes you dumb, and excuses every act of stupidity you commit, and maybe that's just a bunch of bullshit that places the blame on something else, that isn't you.  But however this happend doesn't matter.  What matters is, you will never get a good conversation out of me again, I will have nothing for you but disgust.

If you are one of those fucking idiots who feels the same way, Do not speak to me about it.  I hate ignornace, and to say 'fuck the troops' is ignorant as hell.  First of all, these people give thier lives for you fucks, they are willing to sacrifice everything so you can live a little bit of an easier life.  Second of all, why do you care about all these people you do not know.  You say 'fuck the troops' but do you know anyone in Iraq.  Do you know any troops, do you know any Iraqis.  You don't know a single fucking one of the sides that are fighting this 'war' so how the fuck can you pick a side. Thridly, these people are in the service, if they do not serv their country they go to jail.  Are you fucking stupid, or do you not understand that it is thier duty as an American and as a soldier to serv and protect our nation.  All you hippie fucks can spend your days smoking pot and bitching about shit you don't agree with, but you do not do a single thing about it.  I hope you all grow up, because the future is looking very grim with a youth like this one.  

I have family and friends who have served or are now serving thier country.  I do not want anyone saying 'fuck them' you do not know them, and you don't not know these people we are fighting against.  Get a clue, stop being a fucking pussy. I'm not saying you have to agree with this war.  I'm not saying you have to agree with Bush, but I AM SAYING THAT MAKING A MYSPACE GROUP CALLED 'FUCK THE TROOPS' IS FUCKING IGNORANT.  THESE TROOPS ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE JUST DOING THIER JOB.  WHO ARE YOU TO SAY 'FUCK THEM' WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIER DUTIES OR KNOW THEM AS PEOPLE.  YOU FUCKING MORONS.

If you retards really need someone to blame for this shit, do not blame the people who are doing thier jobs.  Blame someone else, I mean, isn't that what you normally do? You must blame everyone and everything, for everything that you do not agree with.  So blame a politician or the president, someone a little more traditional.  Do not blame soldiers, or say 'fuck soliders' beucase your weak narrow mind feels that taking an 'alternative stand' on a fucking issue is the cool thing to do. And just so you know using 'big words' or a statistic or two that makes you look smart and it makes your opinion right.  It doesn't you are just a fucking pussy.

A lot of people are complaining about how small it is....I personally love small venues, with a lot of people.  I think it makes shit fun.

"event","So, today I came home from school and just slept basically all the way up until right now.  I was up for a little bit inbetween sleeps.  I slept at school too.  My sleeping cycle is going to be a little screwed up for the next few days but oh well.  Nothing really exciting happened today.  I started dowloading a George Carlin set, and questioning the point of existance.  It baffles me, we are all told to do well and to be sucessful and enjoy life, but it ends.  Everything ends, it sucks too.  It kind of scares me in way, but it also makes me feel a way that I can't describe.  I just hope I am ready for death when it comes to me.  

Lately I've been noticing more of the selfishness that is plaguing the world around me.  I've also noticed how everyone cares so much about looking and being perceived a ceratin way.  I guess it all has to do with growing up, but it's kind of bullshit, to life your lifestyle (or at least claim a lifestlye) just to be held a certain way within other peoples thoughts.  But that's irrelevent, and everyone probably feels the same way, even if you are one of those people who only cares about your 'image'...but your too afraid to admit it to yourself.  Maybe afraid isn't the correct word, but whatever.  The selfishness of everyone doesn't really need to be talked about, everyone sees and commmits this shit every fucking day, knowingly or not.  AND being an elitist jock will only last you thoughtout highschool, when you graduate and figure out colleges don't accept mediocre players, you will for once in your life have the shit end of the stick and maybe experince a little but of what I've gone though my whole life.  But it will be okay, beucase soon mommy and daddy will come to your rescue with money for school, and or a job at whatever business they own.  So you will be set for life, without doing much for yourself.  This certiantly doesn't apply to all, not everyone is this steriotypical, but some are....and they, for the most part, strive to be.


But whatever, I can't for one second say that I have seen the world from anyone elses eyes, or experinced what they have.  No one can say that about me either, it just pisses me off when people act better than other people, when really we are the same, and half the time you are inclined to act better becuase life has been made too easy.  It seems like that is human nature.  I don't know, whatever"

"event","I have once again another live journal.  Whatever, I might keep this one, I might do with it what I did with the others.  Anyways...I was blogging a lot on myspace, and that gets kind of lame, the blogs aren't as cool and no one really looks at them and shit, and even less people look here.  I am rambling sorry. 

Today was another day just like the rest.  It wasn't too fun, however I do have a (false) sense of a accomplishment.  I went to school and did all my work with effort, I came home and dubbed in two movie clips into the Out Of Hand demo, which is going to hit the scene soon...there are unmastered and un finalized copies on slsk and a few songs my myspace, so everyone should check that shit out.  I also fixed my desk, which has been broken since Matt and Bentley were in town, and Bentley broke it.  I have to return some videos, and I'm probably not going to get around to that for a while.  

I quit smoking, and don't plan on starting again.  I also do not party at all, and never plan on it.  I am sort of happy with what has happened in that department of my life.  I still find it hard to talk to girls I really have an interest in.  And that's weird beucase I can talk forever about nothing and make sense of it all.  I think it's because the girls I have interest in don't have any in me, so it's like talking to a wall, except walls don't give you looks like 'why the hell are you talking to me' but there are some girls who have given me the time of day, and yeah I don't know how that shit went.  

So yeah, I am looking forward to the Black My Heart Show on Sunday, I would have used to flyer as my background, but I used my own bands instead simply it's a day after, and I need to promote that shit way more, I'm not sure many people know about it, and I'm not sure many people are going to make the haul to see us.  We should have our demos ready to go by Saturday.  I am going to use flyers as my backgrounds I think, so people who read this shit also know about shows that are goin' on and shit.  

I gots shit to do, like sleep and eat. So I can't spend anymore time on this computer."

my roommate came back today, and honestly I wish she haden't.  It just remainds me of what I don't have and what I can't have and all that has been lost.
I miss the people that I am friends with.
I need distraction.
Tomorrow is new years eve.  great.
2004 was a fucked up year and I guess that I am glad it is over, but next year is going to be even more annoying.
I guess I can't wait until 2006... but it's bad to hope.
I will be 21 next year.  great."

"event","So, here goes, another bi-monthly update.  I moved to Brookline.  It's a nice apartment, I have a bigroom all to myself, but it makes socializing a lot harder.  Would I rather spend time alone in my room?  Or talk to other people?  Usually I just want to be alone.  Also, since it is a fam apt building, it's a lot harder to have a lot of friends over and feel comfortable.  But that suits me just fine since, like I said, I have been enjoying my solitary time.

I went home for Thanksgiving, which was great.  I wish that I could have stayed there longer.  Done more while I was there.  I saw a couple old friends and I wish that I had more time to catch up.  But while I was there my mom gave me my christmas present early since I wouldn't be going home for the holidays.  I got an iPod.  Woohoo.  I didn't even realize that I needed one, much less wanted one that badly, but it has been a real life saver.  So, go technology!

The end of the school year was a bit hectic and I was really nervous that I would just fuck everything up.  I pretty much held my breath through finals and did all that I could with the amount of time and motivation that I could muster.  So I finished classes feeling a bit nervous about how it would all turn out.  I still haven't totally completed my massart class because my boss wouldn't let me take the time off to meet with my prof one last time, so now I have to get him my portfolio on Mon, which will be a huge pain in the ass.. but whatever.  So anyway, to say the least I was nervous.

Then, school was over and everyone started heading home for the holidays and I started to orient myself to the idea that I would not be going anywhere.  The hardest person to say goodbye to was davis.  And he is also the person I miss the most too... even more than my family... which is kinda strange.  But, maybe it's more equal.  I just feel that if my parents really wanted to, they could have made me come home or something like that.  They could have told me to quit my job or something, but it's all over now, so I wont think about it.  

I've kinda been wasting my itme just watching tv.  I had all these plans of things I wanted to get done while being by myself, and i haven't done one thing.  I'll try to get motivated next week.  J will be back by the end of next week so maybe she'll know about some new years thing that we could do.  Last year I made a livejournal... and now one year has gone by... but this isn't my reminising entry... that will be later...

So, I spent my first christmas by myself.  It was fine.  NOthing tragic.  And to top it all off... a christmas miracle.  I just checked my grades for this last semester... and I got a 3.85.  I made the Dean's List... I got two A's and two A-'s...so crazy.  Working, extra class, and a fucking shitty tragity... and i made it through school... I don't understand.  I seem to do best under pressure.  Anyway, that's all for now... I'll update one more time before the end of the year.. if not more."

"event","So it's been another two months since I updated...

I got a job at Ritz Camera, which I hated at first, and now I've grown to accept it.  At least there is a consistent income of money, even though I have to work the weekends so I don't have any time off during my week.  School Mon-Fri then work over the weekend.  But like I said, anything for money.  I can't go home for Christmas, which is sad since I'll be alone in Boston.  But maybe I'll try to bake a chicken or something.  What do you eat for the holidays?  I can't remember, all I can think about is Thanksgiving (When I get to go home!! Yay!)  

I'm taking another color class at Mass Art which is cool, but not at the same time.  I like the fact that I can print color when I want, it's just the when that is the problem.  i don't have time for this class so it's kinda cramping my style.  But I am working on the same project that I started over the summer and I was using the Seagull until it crapped out on me so I borrowed a Mamiya from the school and it takes some HOT pics. I am bummed about the Seagull though :(  Maybe I'll try to get it fixed.

School was good at first.  I was taking it seriously and all of that, I enjoy my classes.  But then some HEAVY shit went down and I'm having problems seeing the point of ANYTHING in life.  So I just trudge on and try not to think too much, which doesn't seem to be a problem, it's like I've gone on auto-pilot and when I do need to think or concentrate I can't turn it off.  It makes doing school work near immpossible.  Sometimes I think that people don't realize how hard it is to be involved in some sort of tramatic event whether it is directly effecting you, or effecting the people around you.

I got angy at davis the other day, but then realized that I wasn't angry at him at all.  He was like, ""yell at me, I know you want to.""  but I just couldn't.  I can't yell at people.  I think it's because I think to much at the situation and then usually realized how petty and futile the whole thing is.  davis is so goddamn chill I don't know what I would do without him.  Such a pH balanced dude.

So, because of the SHIT that went down I'm moving to Brookline in about four days.  As if there wasn't enough stress, but I guess it will be good to get out of here.  I just wish that I could have a consistent extended period of time where I did not have to reorient my life.  It's such a pain in the ass.

That's my bi-monthly rant for now..."

"event","Everything changes so quickly these days which is why when I don't update for two months it is most likely best to just start from the present day, but I am about to attempt a brief recap... we'll see how far I get...

July began much like June ended... which is to say I was working a lot and trying to find time to go to the darkroom all the while trying to do things that involved either intense social and recreational involvment or intense rest.  Davis and I tried to do a mini-vacation each Sunday (the only day we both had off).  The first place we went to was George's Island, which is part of the Harbor Islands in Boston, and is this fantastic place that is reminisent of a huge playground for adults... Another weekend we went to Walden Pond and went swimming and walked around the pond on this nature trail.  So in Mass apparently ""Ponds"" are really ""Lakes"" and there is no distingishment between the two, so bodies of water seem to be absently named according to no pre-established rules... in fact most of Mass is designed that way... Anyway, at some point towards the end of July I learned that my store was closing on July 31st and that I would be out of a job... so... I decided to go on unemployment (what a NIGHTMARE), which worked out great... until... the complication... but I'll come to that.  At the end of July I finally found myself with A LOT of time on my hands... which, believe you me, is not a good thing...

At the beginning of August I finally made it to NYC... it was real great!  I spent about six hours there, but I got a good feel for the place and an still willing and enthusiastic about going back... possibly for more time... unfortunanlty I didn't bring my camera (d'oh!) so I took pics with Davis's camera and who knows when those will be developed... bah.  I also spent a lot of time cleaning the house, cooking meals that I finally had time to prepare, reading (I'm almost done with the six Robin Hobb books that are directly related to the Farseer chain), doing craft projects like shillacing a Reefer Madness poster to the coffee table and then painting the tabletop black and the legs white... in fact I have a picture... but anyway, by the late middle it was time to go to Vermont to an extended vacation (which would have felt like that except that I was currently on an extended vacation anyway)... Vermont was a well deserved BLAST... involving, among other things, cabin life, camp fires, marshmellows, s'mores, lake life, swimming, paddle boating, jumping off of docks, sitting back, grill outs, lounging, and just a little more lounging... after that we came back to boston and all of a sudden August is almost over and school is about to begin again... on sept 13... this summer seems to have lasted a ridiculously long time... 

I managed to go back to Seattle TWICE, then go to Tennesse, see New York, go back to Vermont after having not been there for a year and a half... pretty good for a summer...

I also have met a lot of new people through the twisted web that is College Boston where everyone is connected to everyone else whether you want to be or not... anyway, I met some really cool solid people who I hope to hang out with once the school year starts along with my school peeps.

I've been watching WAY too much television recently... it makes me feel quEEzy.

I updated Photobucket, check out ""Colorphoto Final"" ""Cityscape"" and ""Summer 04""

I'm going to try to update LJ on a more consistent basis in the future... the year is almost over and I still have this silly thing... go me!"

Jacks and I had a booth at this Festival of Fire in Roxbury yesterday and for some reason I thouht it would be a relativly large event, but no, it was tiny, and I spent so much time and mental anguish coming up with jewlery pieces just to have not a single one sell yesterday.  ""You have lovely designs!""  ""Your jewlery is beautiful""  So fucking buy it prick!  Ah well.. it was reletivly alright until the rain storm which forced us to cover everything with a tarp and then hull it under the tent next to us and then watch as a river of water engulfed the the road and everything that had been under the table got soaked and then watching the goddamn hippies dancing in the rain to the beats of the african drumers... god it was typical.  NEedless to say after that we went STRAIGHT home and tried to dry off...

I love davis.

We had a party at my place for my birthday on fri... it was fun... pretty sucessful.  We have a handle of whiskey, a handle of vodka, and a fifth of yager left.  Well, there really only a little left in each, but it's better not to think about it.

All I want to do is sleep and I can't even do that until next sunday, but with my luck something will come up and I'll have to do something on sunday.

This summer has been far more buisier then my school year ever was.

Color photography is a blast!  Soon I'll put pictures up."

"event","I think it's just because I am VERY BORED at work that I have finally gotten around to updating my LJ.  I'm not sure when the last time I updated was so bare with me.  I passed this last semester with the most minimum amount of work, shockingly, or maybe not.  My friendship with John really revitalized my photography because through his work I was inspired and motivated to work harder myself.  This summer I'm taking a color photography class at Mass Art.  There is no boss at Kabloom now, so work is far more tolerable and i make a considerably higher salary as well.  My apartment in Mission Hill is amazing and is coming together fantastically.  All my roommates have decent jobs so our financial situations are the same with makes life eaiser.  I still feel pasionatly about Davis, but sometimes I wonder if it's all a sham and it's not going as well as I imagine it to be going.  I am a very paranoid person, it's true.  I had a hectic May, where I flew home and then to Taiwan.  I'm going to have a hectic June where I fly home for Sophie's grad and then I fly to Tennessee for Davis's cous's wedding.  After that, NO MORE FLYING.  I have a feeling this summer is going to be very good, and even productive.  I miss the people who have left for the summer and I can't wait until they return in the fall.  I know I should be more social, but all I ever want to do is be with d.  We saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind last night.  It's alright.  All the radio stations in Boston SUCK ASS.  It's criminal, my ears are perpetually bleeding.  I am excited to come home with d.  I am scared that this trip will somehow end our relationship.  Who fucking knows.  I apologise for the rambling."

So... Sat and Sun I did some serious photography printing.  Now, when I print photos i don't waste my time trying to fix up a neg, ya know?  I don't dodge/burn stuff like that.  The neg has to be perfect.  So, basically I print a high volume of pictures because i am not wasting time right?  Which is just what I did this weekend.  On sun my friend was in the darkroom too and he was like... damn you actually pose a threat to my photographic dominance... and I was like, uh I do?  I think you're the one who may be able to consider yourself up to par with me... haha, jokingly of course, and he was like... yeah, you're right.  haha!  I love photography!  Altough, I had a scratch throughout all of my negs on one roll and it's TRAGIC because there are some HOT pictures... so I may have to print them like digitally or something, the monitor was telling me I could and it would be totally worth it.  That hippy sunshine prof of mine better RECOGNIZE my hardwork in that class for the stuff we SHOULD be doing.

Davis came back yesterday.  *SMILES!*  I didn't realize how, I guess importnat, he is to me until I had him back.  It's like having icing on my cake.

Ah... and now for the difference... so, not going to stay in this apartment... I hope my parents don't FREAK OUT.  The thing is... we may be able to live somewhere better for cheeper.  I'm not holding my breath, but there is this FABULOUS place in Mission Hill that is owned by this esentric old man who is about o croke and it's hella cheap... for instance I would be paying 300 a month instead of 500, I'd still have my own room and my own porch (woohoo), there a living room, a dining room (with a fade mini chandaleir deal), a kitchen that is huge, a back porch, a veggie patch so I can grow veggies and flowers!!, and two other bedrooms.  Also, a washer machine in the kitchen.  I'd actually do my laundry because I wouldn't have to save up coins to get it done!  HOW NOVEL!  haha.  And it's like five t stops from d instead of two lines!  haha... oh it would be so SWEET.  but like I said... no guarentees..."

"event","Ugh, St. Patrick's Day.  Ugh.  I was so determined not to go out.  I was going to stay at home and get a bunch of homework done, you know, get a grip on my life and all that jazz.  But oh no, no, I just had to involve myself in the festivities.  It was really strange because I first went to visit Liz and the hizouse.  It was alright, but I was regretting coming out almost immediatly.  But then!!  Amy was like, yo t called and was all like we should go over and man... i was like that's a way bad idea... and so on... so the only way I would go over to their place was if I got drunk... which I kinda did, but then when we got there I drank a lot more, because honestly it would have just ended in bloodshed. Yeah, I don't know about that scene.  It's just not good.  And because everyone was so trashed I can't take anything anyone said seriously. bah.
Then yesterday... oh man, yesterday sucked a lot.  I didn't go to my first class and then I didn't go to my second class because I had a meeting with my professor, but he didn't show up, so I wasted all of that time.  Then at three I had to meet kelley and mel to get our nails done, which was actually a good thing, and then we went to Fridays because that is becoming a tradition, which was also alright.  BUT THEN!  I had to go to my STUPID BULLSHIT photo class where we don't DO ANYTHING and we go to STUPID talks with photojounalists and all of this shit... it's like that WORST MOST UNPRODUCTIVE CLASS EVER!!!!  ARGH!!!!  It gets me SO ANGRY.  and I've become vocal about it in the class.  WHY DO WE HAVE TO SPEND AN ENTIRE CLASS LEARNING TO PRINT ON FIBER PAPER!!  This is a FUCKING photo 2 class.  Oh my god, oh my god... I'm going to freak out... again.  Nevertheless, after I ended up just skipping out on the field trip we had, I went home and watched Extreme Makeover, which is such a bizaroo show, and then amy and i went to brendens.  I wasn't planning on staying, but we did and we watched Dawn of the Dead in anticipation for the release of the updated version today.  Woohoo... it's a really good movie and a great soundtrack.  So yeah, spent the night at brendens.  Oh that poor kid.  Ah well.
Yeah... need to find two cool people to lease the apartment for next year. Gawd damn."

So, Tue and Wed I was busy with life I guess.  Both nights my roommate and her boyfriend were around so we smoked a lot of weed and it was great... I was able to distract myself from thinking about d for a while, which is helpful to stay positive and not get uh... angry for no reason.  
Thur was hilarious, when there was a break during class I went to the 7 eleven to buy cigarettes and who do I see there but Amy, who's been around, but HER manfriend was in town so I didn't really see a lot of her and then I was spending time with my manfriend... anyway... I saw her and after smoking a cigarette we decided to meet after class to get some lunch.  Anyway, we made a small detour to our old haunts in the Garden, and let me tell you!  It's so great to have a place to ourselves.  Anyway, afterwards I thought that I could get out of my photo class early and meet davis and his dad for dinner, but no such luck.  Instead! we had a fieldtrip to Simmons College to listen to female photojounalists tell us things... which was bullshit because it was all femmen nazi retoric which was killing my soul because all I wanted was to be with d... but then!  it finally finished and I ended up having coffee with them instead.  His dad is a laugh riot!  it was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be... the rest of the night was just what I had been waiting for since I last saw him.  I met his roommate who was out of control!  A rich Northeasterner from the Hamptons.  crazy.
After school and work on Fri d came over and brought beer and I got pizza and it was a good ol wholesome all American friday night.  woohoo
And for the BIG saturday night gathering!  I bought six bottle of wine (2 red, 2 white, 2 rose) three kinds of cheese and some classy crackers.  Transportted it all home, prepared it.  Yena came... it was fabulous!  John didn't come... which kinda ruined the whole point... but Yena had a muthafucking huge ass hicky on her neck.. so I guess she's not that bad off... and it didn't matter anyway.  Jacks came and then Liz called and she came out which was great and unexpected.  My roommate and her bf were here... so yeh!  All the cheese and all the wine was gone by this morning.  Good conversation and good times... d was AMAZING that night... hot hot shit. mmmmm mmmm!

""who are we?  what's going on?""  AND I WAS LIKE WAY.  What is going on?  This is not my life.  This is some sort of amazing vicarious existance and one day I'm going to finally start awake and realize that none of this is real.  Nevertheless, deep thoughts people.  Last night, into this morning, until I had to get off the T at Boylston... was perfect!
FOR FUCKS SAKE!  Boston is out of control.  So, I'm heading out of the boylston T and all of a sudden I realize that there is a massed crowd lined up along the sidewalk waiting for the parading Patriots to come by.  WHY?? Why is Emerson located in the busiest part of town??  Needless to say, it took me a half hour to cross the street and I was late for class.
NO WORK TODAY!  YAY!  I'm home and I'm staying home until tomorrow.  :)"

"event","What a fabulous weekend.  After work on Fri (I got out two hours early!) I walked down Newbury to go to Trident and ""look"" at the books.  Man, I like books.  I bought Tropic of Cancer (finally) and Prague, this book about ex-patriots in the early 90's.  I'm excited about both, but Davis took Tropic of Cancer, so I'll have to wait until he is done to read it.  *shakes fist angeraly*  Anyway, after that, made a stop out in Allston, which was generally dissapointing. BUT! BUT!  As fate would have it, on my way back into town, I bumped into jvd on Mass Ave and... this blows my mind... I had the opportunity to ask him a very important question, which he answered positively... which MADE ME VERY HAPPY!  That was the beginning of a turn around in my day.  I went to a party with D and it was interesting to hang out with strangers and try to find conversation topics, especially when baked and holding a plastic cup of cheap beer.  We left pretty early and it was so nice to go back to simplicity.
I had to work yesterday, but it was fun because I was working with Melissa and we were productive, yet found the time to get food and go shopping.  I bought an awesome pair of pants at the Express winter clearence sale and a tank top.  The pants were $15... rock on!
That night, her, mike, me, and d all went out to eat.  That was fun.  I wish I had a fakie, then we could have all gone out for drinks afterwards... oh well.  After dinner (melissa and I were on a roll) d and I walked through the Gardens and on the frozen pond, out to the Fiedler Bridge.  All places I used to spend all my time at last year, but haven't bee out to yet since coming back from europe.  We walked back to Mass Ave, got a couple bottles of wine and the movie Winged Migration.  We got really baked, drank a bottle of wine, and synced the movie to some music called Mr. Bungaloo??  It was a TRIP!  Good times... I slept SO WELL! last night. ahhhh
And then this morning...
Then I had a tuna sandwich... and my T pass started... TIME FLIES!!!!!"

I like the way I printed the photos... i mean they look really good, but I don't know how I feel about the composition as much.  Anyway, my prof was very enthusiastic, but she seems to be that way for everyone, whether good or bad.  AND THE PEOPLE IN MY CLASS ARE STUPID!!!  They barely know what a camera is.  IT PISSES ME OFF.  WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN PHOTO 2??  Anyway... I chose to ignore it and I left early since I spent all day in the dark room... from 2:30-6:00 I printed and then it was class and so yeah... I did my fair share of work.
Speaking of which... stopped in at work today and picked up some stuff from melissa and I thought I was going to be late for class (cause I was like 10 min late), but no, i saw my prof walking across the street, just as I was crossing.  ROCK ON.
I spent last night with my manfriend and we were gonna watch Annie Hall, but we ended up just talking.

Work on Mon was hell.  I had to do so much and the person I was working with would not do anything.  I was getting really irrate and when I was breaking boxes down, I really cut up my hands. There's like five scratches... and they hurt... but I guess it builds character?  Anyway, today was nice because I DIDN'T go to work, for once and I opened a bank account and I had coffee with Davis and I bought photo supplies and I cooked up some chicken and made myself a sandwich.  Last night I got really fancy.  I fried up potatoes, cooked chicken and sauted onions, mushrooms, peppers, and tomatoes.  It was delicious!  I decided that it was about time I actually ate something besides... uh cheese chunks and cheese its... do you see the theme?
OH!!  I have a rant!  I had to listen to the alt rock station here in boston on my day of hell at work day and it was killing my soul... i swear my ears were hemoragging.  That music is the worst shit ever.  Blink 182, uh... I can remember them so clearly because I heard their song like 500 zillion times!!!  and other shitty artists who complain about trivial matters as if the listener should care, or that they will somehow connect to the listener, even though the events they crooooooooonnnn about happened to them twenty years ago, OR the fan base hey are trying to draw couldn't even relate no matter what.  And it's all the same old shit!!  Each song is the same, unoriginal, formulaic, boring, an abomination of all that is holy about music and ON THE RADIO.  Who the fuck listens to this shit??  They should be instiutionalized and rehabilitated and returned to society only after they are sucessfully cured.  FOR REAL PEOPLE, it's not that hard to try a little harder.  for fucks sake.
Still in love (that's rather strong), so,  Still wildly happy!  My time with him is never enough...ahhhhh"

so I got together with my manfriend (haha, melissa called him that so...yeah) on fri.  what a beautiful human being.  just seeing him made me feel a lot better, in general, as an overall state.  we get along so well... like salt disolved in water... I'm disolving (did I just write that? christ).  good beer, good conversation, good times... *girlish giggle*  all I want to do is lie in bed with him forever... like those lovers that disappear, don't need to eat, don't need to talk to other people... just exisit together.  it was brutal going to work on sat, having to get up and leave him...
work was boring, but it was great working with melissa again... after having had to work with stupid people all week.  her and mike came to the party... and bought the booze... well with my money, but yeah...
the party... whoa... crazy times... got fucked up enough before a lot of people showed up that it was okay.  my basic ice breaker was ""yo!  there's a lot of booze in the kitchen!  go get yourself something!""  yes, everything was an exlamation.  but I guess it went alright, everyone seemed to have a decent time... towards the end of the night... I think... I pulled my manfriend into my room, barricaded the door and we didn't leave until four today.  god waking up was hard...
I AM SO HAPPY!!  :D   life is beautiful
oh yeah... and my friends from last year are all whores, fuck them"

However, I do like all of my professors, so... I think that bodes well.  Photo is gonna be ROCKING!!  And my good friend Ashley... IS A WHORE.  I just have to lay this out because it's a really WHORISH thing to do.  She came up to me in my first class today and was like ""let's hang out tonight, I want to come over to your place.""  This was clear out of the blue, so I was like ""cool.""  Then at the end of our last class today, she was all ""oh actually, I'm feeling really tired, I'm not going to make it out.""  Fine, whatever, I understand, that's cool.  BUT THEN!!  She was on the phone to this boy she's all into and was like... ""yeah, I'm heading over to Jenny's, we'll be drinking, you should come.""  RIGHT AS I WAS STANDING THERE!  WHAT A CUNT!!  Anyway... yeah, I was pissed, and she is no longer any friend of mine.  Fuck it.

After work yesterday, it was great to hang out with Jacks and Amy and Davis and just talk and chilllllll.... what was funny though, was when I first entered the house our mia roommate was there and at first I didn't recognise her, but then I realized who it was and yeah... good times... now we're all here...

he walked me to the T stop... sigh
Ashley's party blew.  Chris and Greg were on the same T at me and chatted and walked to her apartment together.  Everyone I knew was in the smoking room and at first I didn'tknow that so I was really scared that I would have to hang out with stupid assholes, but then I found my friends... who... had all been discussing my evening, of course... but it was funny in a way.  I made ash a card and bought her one too... they were both very amusing.  I didn't talk to ash at all.  I was already doing fine for myself... had drunken half a bottle of wine and well... started drinking a lot of free beer... so eventually I called mel and left her and aparently incomprehensible message on her birthday, just like I said I would.  hehe
So then after that I came back home and I haven't left since.  I really like my apartment, it's really cosy and just all around wonderful.  And I totally dig my room.  So..uh... yeah... I'm as happy as a mutherfucking clam!  :D"

Wow, I worked my ass off at work yesterday.  I even helped prepare arrangments, it was a lot of fun... maybe a sign for a raise??  Who knows.
I decided to head back out to Allston to pay some friends a visit... also I wanted to get high, but I didn't want to pay for it.  Their good ol friend was there who they kept talking about all summer and I was like, ""wow, cool to finally meet you, I've heard so much about you... that I can't remember.""  Anyway, turns out we had met before, over the summer, now how am I supposed to remember that?  Anyway, we got really fucked up, or at least I got supper mellowed out and this really nice guy kept talking to me and eventually I had to leave to catch the T and he did to, so we caught it together and then when he was getting off at his stop he basically said that we should get together, and I gave him my phone number.  What a fucking wierd night.
And then! As I was writing this entry my furniture that I ordered off Staples came, so of course I had to assemble it, so now it is all assembled in my room.  Ahh... my room is beginning to look like a room!  yay!"

It was a lot of fun and I'd never done it before.  The people seemed like professionals and there was a steady stream of customers.  very fun.  after that I came back to EB and bought sheets and a lamp and a purse (just to solidify the whole girly thing).  stopped by blockbuster to grab Underworld.
Underworld... interesting movie.  Vampires, warewolves... the whole deal.  Good cimematography, but the storyline was a bit vauge and unexplained.  Nevertheless fun times.

Luckly, in the seven hours I worked today there were about seven customers, so we only had to leave our caccoon of heat once an hour.  Got to fight this death cold, christ.
After work I went down to Allston which sucked and made me angry because I could have gotten a free ride home instead of wasting a token on the stupid T and visiting stupid people.
Rented a movie.  Deep Shock.  I don't know if it was a made for TV movie or some sort of evil joke, but it was shockingly bad.  I thought it had to have been made in the mid 90's, but no, it was made last year.  And the plot sounded so good.  An alien creature discovered in the north pole trying to distroy the world.  Oh well, at least we got a free movie rental for Underworld because it wasn't in stock at the store.  The guy tried to give me shit about asking for the free vouture, but you know, that happens when you have a HUGE sign that says ""Garenteed in Stock"" and it's not in stock.  So suck it Blockbuster in East Boston.  
Gah, I never thought I would be so freaked out by mice, but as I was watcing that oscar award deserving film, a little mouse popped up behind the rolled up ruge and I must have yelped each time it stuck its little head up, until I realized it was scared of me.  Then I no longer cared, but still... I need to get mouse traps.  It looked so cute! With is little ears and beady eyes and twitching nose.  Hum... or maybe poison pellets.

After spending an accumulative 1.5 hours on hold, only to be patranized by the tech support for the stupid wireless internet router connection that I have at my apartment, it finally all worked out.  My I am so proud of myself right now.  It's a happy time.  But nevertheless, I still hate technology.
On that note, I did get a new ribbon for my mom's typewriter, which I have.  That was another great and happy moment in my life... or at least for today.
And another thing, when I was at work today the guy I was working with asked me if I was doing anything and I said ""no"" and he said ""good.""  Then he bought pizza and we ate it.  It was a good day at work as well.
Yesterday was really strange because I went out to Cambridge to order my ribbon and I met up with my friend from the Castle and we talked, mainly about how strange it was to be back and find that all of our old friends are now established in different lives with strange new people.  So after that I met up with one of those ""old friends"" and ended up going to a comedy show, which turned out to be really funny and good, so $8 spent well.  And then after that I took a cab home and the meter was broken in the cab so I was able to make my own price.  And the cabby gave me a cigarette and we talked about Micheal Moore.  Interesting times indeed.
I think that's all for now.  My new apartment is amazing and slowly, but surely I will finish furnishing it.  I bought some really cool plate from pottery barn which was exciting because they were %50 off.  I've been playing my violin, which is depressing.  I need a teacher.  And... I think that's all."

Melissa came and that was fun.  I went to pick her up at the airport and that was a very intense experience, involving rain and bad windshield wipers and security check points... well you get the gist.  But after that it went fine.
New Years was mellow.  I hung out with an old high school friend which was good, but it also made me appriciate even more the fact that I was able to leave home and go college somewhere where I would not fall into the old rut trap... god that's depressing.
I completed my ankel tattoo finally.  I was really cool because I had the same artist complete it and he remembered me and he mentioned something about how he liked my design... yada yada... it made me happy and I think I'm going to have him finish the one on my back when I come back in the summer.  He also cut me a SWEET deal... I like sweet deals.  I also bought two new sets of jewlery for my ears.  woohoo.
My new years resolutions are to ring in next years new years with the same live journal account with reletively up-to-date updates.  And keep in contact with old friends (share a drink now and then... who knows what quote that is?  haha).  Last, stay HEALTHY!
Cooked with Jeanette and Melissa helped... it was fun, but I realized how much I hate cooking, it's stressful and hard.  Mindy came over for dinner and it was like a dinner party.  Which I really want to do back in Boston... speaking of which...

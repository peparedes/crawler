"event","Raaaagghhhh, what is wrong with me?  This connects to the whole artist fear thing from earlier, but... why do I care what random people I admire on the internet think of me?  I don't give a shit about people in real life.  I have the utmost confidence in myself in everyday situations.  What is it about joining a community of artists that love the same things I do that fills me with a supremely frustrating mix of 'WANT' and 'they're all gonna laugh at you!'  And this is about a freaking dA group, by the way.  Just a group of gryphon artists doing challenges that I desperately want to join but equally desperately don't want to get rejected by.  So I fret and get ideas and do nothing in the end.  Fukit.

In other news, Jinn finally bought a car.  Some little Volvo (yes, the vulva jokes have commenced) that he's in the process of insuring and then he gets to move in.  Yaaayyy!  It only took a year.  >.>

"event","I woke this morning fully intending to go to work.  I got dressed, made my lunch, and sat down at the computer to waste the last 30 minutes before I needed to head out.  Big mistake.  I opened Minecraft and got involved in a project to make a floor of lava.  When the time to leave came around, I decided that I really didn't need to go in today and called out.  Then I finished my lava floor (which is awesome, by the way), chased the cat around for a bit, and made an ice cream date with Jinn.  After said ice cream we went for a walk at the local state forest during which there may have been attempts to throw each other into the lake and a pine cone fight.  I couldn't say.  But then the sun went down.

I understand now why people go nuts in the winter and end up killing their housemates.  After it got dark and we were forced to go inside or risk mauling and rape (not by each other,) I got sooooo restless.  I wanted to go do physical activities but going anywhere that was lit means dealing with random asshats of society and I just can't bring myself to do that.  So I got a taste of what the rest of the winter will be like and it was bitter, bitter, bitter and ended up with a lot of sniping at Jinn until I took him home.  Can't wait until he moves in.



P.S.  I absolutely hate the fact that I get whined at if I don't check out every link he sends me (which is usually something from 4chan involving penises) but refuses to look at anything I link because he doesn't trust random sites.  I think I know how to be careful on the internet by now and besides, he uses NoScript too and if I haven't gotten a virus yet he won't either.  And also besides, I'M NOT LINKING FUCKING PENIS PICTURES."

"event","I know all about artist block, I've had it many many times. But lately I've been having a different issue. I finally got my tablet and photoshop issues fixed, got my scanner drivers updated so it's working now, bought a new sketchbook that sits beside my bed for when I get those random urges to doodle... and I haven't done anything. The excuses flow fast and profuse- Oh, I need to do something in this game or oh, I just want to read a few chapters first. But in the end I think I am afraid to try and do actual art again. All I've shoveled out lately is those stupid VHR pictures. I have plenty of ideas, concepts, whatnot. My brain screams with things to try... but I can't seem to get up the courage to pick up a damned pencil. It's been years since I really put forth my all into an attempt. What if I've lost it? Granted nothing I've done is outstanding but to be even worse? Scary scary. Anyone else ever have this feeling?"

I didn't think I would miss him so badly seeing as we're still in the process of shoring up our relationship but I do.  It was a really good visit, we showed him a lot of the local outdoor parks and whatnot.  So, a good week all in all.

I finally got into an apartment thanks to Mom's help.  Still bugging Jinn to get a paying job so he can move in with me.  Got yet another job, this time at a grocery store.  I'm such a loser.  >.<  But it pays the bills and I've finally got my internet back after 6 months without it.  And I'm not a frothing insane mess!  Go me!"

"event","Gah, I'm so bad at this.  Anyways, found the cat.  She'd been hiding under a nasty old couch in the basement for a week.  Not stuck, she's just neurotic and wouldn't come out.  We finally coaxed her out and then Jinn and a friend of his cleaned out all the old furniture down here and cat-proofed it.  She bounced back, gained weight and since then has become amazingly... bouncy.  I mean it's just weird.  She takes flying leaps across the room to chase string and cannonballs up and down the stairs for no reason.  She seems so happy, and is still a little lap slut.  So yay, my cat is fine."

"event","Wow, so it's been almost 2 years since I actually posted in this journal?  Sheesh.  Let's see, what's been going on?  The socialness I was bitching about in the last couple of posts?  I have packed up and moved halfway across the country for the guy that prompted that.  We've been living together for a year now and still doing great, thank goodness.  All mushyness aside, I'd be comfortable saying that Jinn's who I will be growing old with.  We know each other's faults and are able to ignore or deal with them.  >.>  On a side note, the road trip from Texas to Massachusetts was AWESOME!  Minus the gas prices last summer.  We took a week off and just cruised, no rush no hurry.  Some of those little tourist trap areas were neat, like a freshwater pearl farm and a cavern with a river running through it.

Jobwise, I am unemployed again.  *sighs*  I was working at Lowe's for a while in the cash office until I transferred up here.  The store I moved to said they needed a cash office person, but when I got here they used me to give the two girls in there already their vacations, and then stuck me on the registers every day.  I thought it was a raw deal myself.  So I looked up a placement agency who found me an admin assistant job with an offshoot of DHL.  Tried it for about six months and just could not deal with the HR manager who was one of my two bosses.  I have never, NEVER worked for such a freaking bitch.  I try to keep my head low and get along with everyone at work, rocking the boat is never really worth it unless you're absolutely miserable.  But this lady was just incredibly rude to everyone!  And she's HR!!  I saw so many people leave because of her but she was always polite and brown-nosed to the higher ups.  So I left there and the agency placed me on a temporary job with a pottery company filing paperwork and helping the shipping coordinator get pallets labeled and ready to go on the trucks.  While the job itself wasn't all that fun, the people were great and I really wish it could have turned into a permanent job.  Oh well.  That one ended two weeks ago and I'm waiting on the agency to find yet another one for me.

My mom came up for a visit this past week while I was out of work.  I'm always glad to see her and we had a wonderful time.  She, Jinn, and I went on a whale watch tour and it was spectacular!  Being out on the open water was so enjoyable and there was so much life out there between seals and various waterfowl.  And, of course, the two humpbacks that decided to play right around our boat.  They were amazing!  And so close, one that was very curious about us kept spy-hopping not eight feet away from where I was standing at the railing.  I'll have to finally download all the pictures off my camera and post some of them on here.

"event","So, I've been single for 4 years this past July.  And celibate.  Not really by choice, but just from lack of available and/or desirable ass.  It really hasn't been an issue, it's like the hormones turned off (or, as my best friend suspects, they went to him).  Anyways, in the past month or so I've switched servers on WoW to join up with some old friends from Grendel's Revenge.  They have a Ventrilo server so we've been voicechatting back and forth while gaming.  Interesting effect- speaking with people my age and with my interests seems to have sparked the hormones again.  So apparently my iron will and 'turn off switch' I've been so proud of for the past 4 years is all bullshit.  Having decent conversations and getting flirted with turns out to suck for me!  I should just go back to IMs and guild chat.  And I damn sure don't want to be tempted by people that live several states away, that's just setting up for stupidity!  Blehness.  Sometimes I wish all my girl parts would just fall out.

On a happier note, I've lost 35 pounds so far after the surgery.  Pretty happy about that.  I also have come to the decision that my art sucks.  It's flat and boring and the shading is monochromatic and there's no atmosphere and my anatomy sucks and... and... etc.  Though my skins seem to be fairly popular in Second Life.  But as far as actual pictures... fleh.  If anyone has some tips on how to choose colors that give a bit of atmosphere but keep the general color impression you want to give, please share.  I'm desperate!  My muse has been slamming me upside the head with the idea bat but she screams and cries when I can't get it out correctly.  And now... peanut butter and crackers.  Nom nom nom."

The woman that interviewed me gave odd looks.  I think I was hissing a children around, but not sure, can't remember.  Yes, I'm am also being lack of sleepish now.

Tuesday: Went to psych appointment.  Was told I'm depressed and need medication for the third time by the woman.  Uh... no?  I don't care to become a zombie from meds and I'm not depressed just because I don't like people and get irritated easily.  When I get a job I'll perk up.

Wednesday: Um... I don't think I did anything besides read a lot.

Thursday: Went to court yet again for the same speeding ticket and still didn't see the damn judge.  Speeding part was dismissed, on probation for 6 months for no insurance.  It had to lapse the one week I was pulled over!  >.<  Experienced my first eggs benedict (sp?) which are totally kick ass.

Friday: Devoted to sending out applications, playing GR, playing VHR.  *huggles Rezzit*  I have spiffy horses.  I also have 30 custom pics for said horses now.  Go me.

My mom's got hyperpulmonary tension.  It's basically where the capillaries between the heart and lungs stiffen and decrease the oxygen flow.  She was diagnosed with it (correctly) about 3 years ago and nights like tonight are becoming more and more common.  There are so many ways things can go wrong for her...  One major thing is she's got a pump that shoots her medication straight into her heart so lots of things can get screwy with that.  Risk of infection, contamination of the valve site on her chest, pump malfunction... you get the picture.  Then there's the physical side.  It's just so fucked up.  No one should cringe every time their mom calls because they're afraid it might be bad news.

I have been a good girl.

It really wasn't my fault what happened at Chris's Christmas party. It was Christy who spiked the punch with too much vodka. I can't help it if I drank 25 glasses. It was so good---smelled and tasted just like feather dust.

I thought it was funny when I put Camille's thong on my head and danced the waltz on the entertainment center while singing `I Will Survive'. I didn't mean to break Chris's toaster and don't know why Chris would sue me for public indecency.

I don't remember calling Mike's wife a disgusting cow---even though she looked like one with neon green eye shadow and red lipstick!

And when I threw up on Christy's husband's ear, it was only because I ate too much of that sausage.

After all that fun, I admit I was a little tired. So I fell asleep on my way home and drove my backhoe through my neighbor's kitchen. I don't think that was any reason for my neighbor to call me a giddy wallaby and have me arrested for arson!

So, Santa...here I sit in my jail cell on Christmas Eve, all sweet and gurgly. And I'm really not to blame for any of this drunken stuff. Please bring me what I want the most---bail money!

Sincerely and quickly yours,
Kalina (Really a nice girl!)

How cool is that?  *mutters*  I still have things to get together tonight so I'm out of here."

...  What the fuck?  So said one of my friends today and it made me feel suprisingly good... I haven't been complimented (however twistedly) in a while.  Ah well.  This was an eventful couple of days... nasty flooding and tornadoes around the area, but thankfully my apartment complex is high and fairly dry.  I was stuck in Channelview with no passable freeways home so the pets had to fend for themselves for a couple of days.  No biggie, the birds had overloaded bowls when I left and the cats are just fatasses that whine even when they have food in the bowl.  But, I was still worried about them.  I guess what little maternal instinct I have kicked in.  Now they are all being major brats.  Go figure.  Oh well, my babies love me."

"event","Well it seems like it's a definite possibility... stability could well be achieved in all facets of my life.&nbsp; Finally.... unheard of for me, where usually stability in one area means that the rest are totally down the pan.

Work is going fantastic still... the week on/week off pattern is fabulous, and I've really enjoyed the chance of extended procrastination this last week, but still been able to get everything I wanted to done. And maybe a bit more too....&nbsp; In a couple of weeks I'll be working a day shift instead of night shift at my ops manager's request - I know he's keen for me to work days full time for &quot;mutual benefits.&quot;

With the job going great, and now having a couple of paydays under my belt, I've got some financial stability back... by this time next month I&nbsp;should be totally on an even keel too, which is great.

And my social life is taking a turn for the better too... I can hardly believe myself for actually going out on a date with someone I&nbsp;only met randomly on Facebook... but after a couple of weeks chatting and getting on well, we went out for dinner on Thursday.&nbsp; Had a great time, and got on really well... we've been chatting and texting each other pretty much constantly ever since, and more dates are on the cards....&nbsp; Maybe I won't feel so much like a 12 year old on the next one!"

"event","So I've officially been signed off my training period now.... In fact I&nbsp;went live onto the floor on Friday when I should have still been in the academy... but having completed the academy test with 100% they thought I was ready for it.&nbsp; Now I just have to complete the next 2 months successfully to complete my probationary period - that's where the pressure is on though - If I&nbsp;was on the day shift I'd have lots of opportunity to demonstrate my abilities.... but the nightshift has a lower workload, and I'm only working for 4 weeks out of the 8, so I&nbsp;have to work doubly hard to show how good&nbsp; I am...&nbsp; I guess providing some innovative solutions to queries will help with that.&nbsp; Still I have a week off now before that all starts.

All in all then, the birthday weekend started ok, with the news from work, then after an early night, a nice drive to Wales to assist a sponsored walk up Snowdon.... the weather was dreadful... It might have been raining, but we were in the clouds from bottom to top of the mountain, so couldn't really say!&nbsp; Unfortunately it meant that the usual fantastic views were lost, but Lou has decided she'll do it again sometime just for the views.... Then the weekemd took a turn for the worse - my eye had stung a little bit in the day, I just assumed a combination of sweat dripping into it, and the wind had irritated it.... especially when it was much improved after flushing it out with water.&nbsp; Woke up Sunday morning and couldn't open the eye, and it was in pain... once it did open the pain went, but it hurt to close it, hurt a bit more to have it closed, and was agony to open.

The campsite owner was fantastic - she showed me on the map where the nearest hospital was... this being Wales it was in Bodelwyddan - some 40 miles away.. and I was the only driver.&nbsp; An agonizing hour later we were there... an hour and a half later after having my eye poked, prodded and blinded by light I was told there was an infection... cause unknown - maybe something had got in that I'd successfully flushed out.... anaesthetic eye drops were administered&nbsp; throughout the examination, but I was given a prescription and orders to go see my own GP&nbsp;asap.&nbsp; Again, Wales reared it's ugly head in the hospital pharmacy being shut.... I&nbsp;was told the nearest one was in Queensferry.&nbsp; As this was now on our way home I figured that with the eye not feeling at all from the anaesthetic I'd get to queensferry and put the drops in - It's a double prescription of 2x a day drops that force my eye to open and anaesthetise it and 4x a day antibiotic drops to treat the infection.... Well the pharmacy we were assured was at the huge Asda in Queensferry was non-existent... and having spoken to a nice security guy we found out all the pharmacies in town were also closed.

Helluva dilemma - how to get home when I couldn't get the anaesthetic into my eyes.. I&nbsp;knew the one from the hospital would wear off a long time before I got home. Witth Lou needing to be home by five to pick her kids up, I stocked up on an optrex eye bath designed to soothe and disinfect and some &quot;cool eyes&quot; to reduce irritation and gingerly headed across the M54 to the M6... we'd decided that if we could get to a pharmacy without going too far out of our way we'd stop, otherwise we'd have to keep going very gingerly along.... I knew that Manchester was too far in the wrong direction, Newcastle Under&nbsp;Lyme was a possibility but everywhere else was too far off the motorway.... Newcastle was a bust however, in keeping with the day, so I&nbsp;bathed and cooled my eye and carried on home.....

Eventually managed to get home, and persuade Chris to drive Lou home to Rushden, only slightly later than planned.&nbsp;

Was not able to sleep very much last night, due to have closed eyes being painful, but I&nbsp;dozed here and there.... just back from the doctor's now, who thinks there is no infection, but just extreme irritation from prolonged contact with a foreign body... he told me not to get the prescription, but to continue using the eye bath and cool eyes to reduce the irritation and soothe the pain... so I'm now sat at home with a sore eye and a tired eye - the tired one from doing most of the work from the sore one yesterday - and wincing every time I&nbsp;blink.&nbsp; I&nbsp;just hope to hell it's better by the time I go back to work."

"event","Well that's the first week in the new job out of the way, and I&nbsp;can reveal that I was mistaken in the belief that I'm British - apparently I'm from southern Germany, possibly Austria.

Just to clarify that, I am the only non-native German on the German speaking team, and while I have not been working with them during my training, I have met and spoken to most of them... as well as one of the Ops managers (who likes to finish every sentence in English with &quot;ja?&quot;). Understandably they have wanted to hear me speak German, so that is how the majority of the conversations have been conducted.&nbsp; One of the girls, after being introduced and talking for a while asked where I was from, whereon she didn't believe I&nbsp;could be British - &quot;your accent is definitely from the south of Germany, maybe even Austria.&nbsp; That's amazing for you to have no trace of speaking a non-native language. It's a very difficult thing to do, but sexy if you can do it.&quot;&nbsp; Sexy appears to be German not for &quot;sexy&quot; but for anything that's good - the ops manager described my shift pattern of 7 on 7 off as &quot;very sexy, I&nbsp;couldn't do it, but it's very sexy, ja?&quot;

Training is going brilliantly - I&nbsp;can't believe I&nbsp;still have another 3 weeks of it to go.&nbsp; A&nbsp;lot of the stuff I&nbsp;already know - like call control, positive language, empathy and other soft skills - from experience at TI, although I was never trained on them there (no surprises) so it's more like a case of &quot;I&nbsp;don't know i&nbsp;know it&quot; and just quantifying it.&nbsp; The system they use is so much easier than TI too - instead of one screen per client, they have one screen full stop, and make every question taken across all of TI's clients compulsary questions at all times.&nbsp; The whole training plan is still fairly new - I'm one of the first to do the 2 weeks training then 2 weeks in the &quot;Academy&quot; (where I get to listen to live calls, and carry out the research for live requests and things) - but you can clearly see that someone with no experience in this kind of job could go through this plan and be able to take calls even while at the academy.&nbsp; The training and mentoring team are brilliant as well, in fact everyone is being really helpful, open and friendly - the MD&nbsp;even insists on first name terms, and keeps taking his coffee break in the training room to come and chat about non-work related stuff.

I've already become somewhat of a legend... everyone seems really surprised about the amount of different topics I can at least talk about basic information with - roleplaying on calming an angry customer today, they picked what they thought would be an obscure topic (Proms concerts) only to find me able to discuss the Proms programme, ticketing policy and stuff at quite an in depth level... but mostly I'm legendary for my smile apparently.&nbsp; Kim the trainer was saying today that no end of the staff have commented on the fact that whenever they see me I'm always smiling - described as &quot;infectious&quot; by the QC manager and also &quot;gorgeous&quot; by a member of staff Kim wouldn't name.

Oh, and on my first day in the job I&nbsp;got myself into the local paper as it was the company's 2nd birthday!&nbsp; It's also the summer BBQ on July 4th with a beach party theme on the huge lawn in front of the office - they've even arranged for a swimming pool (although what sort I&nbsp;don't know, but I'll lay odds it's not going to be like the ones from argos you see for kids)

All in all a fantastic week, they company has done for me what they pledge to do for their customers - exceed expectations! Can't wait for Monday now"

"event","So I&nbsp;have one more day before the new job starts.&nbsp; Yesterday I&nbsp;finally got round to telling my parents that I&nbsp;was starting a new job, but not all the details.&nbsp; They always think the worst in any case, so why should I&nbsp;help them?

Yesterday, the funniest thing happened.&nbsp; I&nbsp;called in at TI to drop of something for Julie that Neil had left here on thursday, so to be polite I&nbsp;stuck my head through the door to say hi to D and H.... Who immediately said that my ears must've been burning or something, because H had just finished a phone call to my new employer giving a reference over the phone.... OK so it was a great coincidence, and H and D did wish me all the best for the new job... but it does set me kinda thinking - Did the new place leave it so late to ask for a reference, or had they previously asked for one in writing and had no response, and in the end had to phone TI&nbsp;to get it over the phone?&nbsp; I guess I'll never know, but it sure piqued my curiosity some!

Dad still on a &quot;No Weight on the leg at all&quot; order, so he's off work for at least another 2 weeks.... but he has got GCSE&nbsp;exam marking starting now, so he'll make a huge lot of headway on that I'm sure.... or maybe not so much this week - Mum's off on a school trip to France for a week, so he's staying with my grandma in Spalding - So he'll be driven mad firstly by my grandma constantly interrupting him with cups of tea and then hanging around... secondly by the fact that she can't go a day without the radio on full belt in the kitchen, even when sat in the lounge watching TV.... as for what it will be like the days she has Harry round, I dread to think.... I suspect that when Mum gets back in a week, she'll be collecting a very grouchy Dad!

It's half past midnight, and I guess this will be that last late night like this for at least a week, since I'll need to be starting work at 0900 Mon-Fri - damn it's gonna be hard to get back into that pattern!&nbsp; Parents not impressed by the permanent nights I'll be on after the first month, but at least my grandma saw the positive side of 7 nights on 7 nights off as giving me free time in nice big chunks, so I'll have more time to see family... if I&nbsp;stop avoiding them that is.

Still.... I'll look on it as Step 1 to getting life back on track being taken on Monday.... Step 2.... well I'm crap at step 2 and always screw it up... but I&nbsp;guess I'll have to keep trying..... sometime the step has to land with my feet on solid ground instead of in my mouth!"

"event","Well it seems like an age since I posted here... Oh that's right, it IS an age since I last posted here!

Well I had a week away on a residential at the school where my mum works to help with their French exchange.&nbsp; The trips and everything were fantastic - particularly as the staff of the French school and&nbsp;I are old friends... but the evenings... jeezus!&nbsp; Trying to get a group of 24 13-year-old boys to get showered and into bed sensibly was a complete nightmare.... I was definitely burning the candle at both ends by being up until about 2:30, having made sure everyone was asleep, then having to get up at 05:30 so I could get showered and dressed in time to wake everyone up for their showers before breakfast.

The trips were great, and the weather was mostly ok.&nbsp; Hunstanton was very cold and blowy, but the Norfolk Broads on Thursday more than made up for it... in more ways than one.&nbsp; I even got to see Mr Cadbury's house!

That kept me occupied throughout Holy Week, and then I had lots of church commitments.&nbsp; Maundy Thursday saw the start of it with the traditional footwashing ceremony, and my first solo of Easter, but the big one came on Easter Saturday - our Easter Service this year included my nephew Harry's baptism, and what with that, and a 15 minute plainsong solo from myself, a 2hr service came about!

Amazingly, once I did returned to work, I found that the office did not fly apart without my presence.... but apparently it came pretty close sometimes!&nbsp; At least my colleagues now fully appreciate the work I put into the Rota and Budget planning every week, on top of my other duties!

Just switching onto a week of nights now... can't shake the nagging feeling that there's something big on my calendar that I'm overlooking, but&nbsp;I can't quite put my finger on it!"

"event","Well that's finished the night shift and I now have no work until Wednesday afternoon, so finally some kicking back time from the main job.

There's still the whole Select Logistics starting up to think about, but all other concerns are secondary this week - we're now only waiting for solicitors to move - which as it's flat rate fee not by the minute for conveyancing, will probably be quite quickly!&nbsp; The Select Logistics start up is also going ok, so my only grievance at the moment is the broken exhaust on my car at a time when I'm trying not to spend any money!&nbsp; That and my non-functioning laptop - but as it's being repaired for free under warranty, it's just frustration at the crummy hard drive which fried after 5 months!

I'm finally starting to feel like I'm back in control of my life, and making decisions based on what I want, not on where I'm needed.

My CRB came through, so during Holy Week I'll be taking&nbsp;a complete break from work and doing some volunteer work at my mum's school when their French Twin School come over from Le Mans.... I can't quite believe that the ream of paperwork and ID checks I presented is something my parents have to go through once every 3 years in order to keep their jobs as teachers.

Well now I'm in&nbsp;a position to start talking to my friends again, and I have made&nbsp;a start renewing a Christmas acquaintance, starting talking after 6 weeks silence is sooooo hard though!&nbsp; Wish me luck!"

"event","Well I'm told that this is the place to come to have a good old rant about life, and as I feel pretty shitty right now, I'm going to have a good old moan. 

Lots of reasons for me feeling shitty, although there are some positives to it as well... 

Firstly, there is the new fulfilment business I have started with Gareth.&nbsp; After a lot of hard work we have landed our first client and received the first shipment this morning.&nbsp; Lots of work went into getting this set up, and not just on the business side, but getting our office sorted out.&nbsp; We are using Gareth's spare room, but it needed decorating first.&nbsp; First snag: Gareth doesn't know how to decorate.&nbsp; Fortunately he does know how to keep up a steady flow of cups of tea and to fetch and carry stuff for me.&nbsp; Anyway all the walls are now stripped and cleaned, repapered, the ceiling and coving have been repainted, I have laid a new laminate floor and Gran is doing the blinds and curtains for us (good old gran!).&nbsp; All that's left is the skirting board. 

Secondly, I'm in the process of buying the house I'm currently renting (gasp!). Yes, Colin is settling down and at least putting a semblance of respectability on things.&nbsp; I just wish someone had told me first how much work was involved: meetings with the mortgage advisor, solicitors, landlady... it seems like I'm just acting as a postman taking letters from one to the other!&nbsp; Fortunately mortgage is all sorted, and all it needs now is the signature on the dotted line... and then I'm officially skint! 

The main reason for my sucky life though is my ""day"" job - which also is a night job...&nbsp; Due to staff absences and one member of staff moving to Scotland halfway through her shift at work thanks to a relationship breakdown, we've been left shortstaffed.&nbsp; And as such Me and Gareth are expected to take up all the slack - direct feed from Senior Management to us as the Operations Managers.&nbsp; So now we have to take care of recruitment and training of additional agents AND do our normal work AND do the work of the missing agent.&nbsp; The office are REALLY taking advantage of the fact I opted out of the Working Time Directive.&nbsp; 0600-2200 work is becoming the norm - I even end up involved in work when I'm out of the office - to the point where I was decorating the new office with my mobile on hands free taking part in a conference call while cutting up floorboards!&nbsp; Still at least I got paid for that.&nbsp; Night shift only makes it worse - as I am expected to be in the office for meetings during the day - best example of this was Tuesday - finish work at 0600 (after 2100 Monday start), meeting with Mortgage Advisor at 0900, during which I&nbsp;had a call from a client advising he was on his way into the office, as he was passing by on his way to a conference.&nbsp; My manager was out of the office for the day, so I ended up at work from 11:30 to 17:00, and then back for my normal shift start at 21:00.&nbsp;&nbsp; The joys of working in a 24/7 inbound customer service call centre. 

Net result of all this is that I feel really crappy, and totally burnt out, and I've really been neglecting my friends (apart from Gareth and Chris whom I work with!).... I'm sure this has destroyed what was turning into a beautiful friendship as well, so a big sorry guys!&nbsp; The good news for you all is that in 2 weeks I've got a week's holiday, during which I'm doing volunteer work for my mum's school as their french partner school is coming over from Le Mans.&nbsp; It's going to be a helluva week - concluded by the christening of my nephew Harry. 

Anyway, that's the rant over with for now - hopefully next time I post I'll have some more positive news for you all. 

Take Care!

"event","so i unno why im really posting in this... no one will read it... but i guess thats all fine and dandy... 
i started drawing again... im thinking of moving more twords animeish manga style this time 'round... stick figures bored me...
stuff has been so weird lately... it feels alot like when your in a car on a really long road trip... and your on the freeway going about 85... and shit is just zipping past and your just sitting there going along with it all leaving all the lines behind... I feel as though I personaly have changed as a person, and I don't like it. I miss my old self, just sitting around content with my computer and a salad with croutons with some orange juice to drink.  I had a daily routine, I was happy with my boring life, and I didnt get into any drama shit.  Then along came this lass who was discontented with my boring life and I started doing more... then she moved on and I had no one more to please, though when I tryed going back to my old life... it seemed horridly droll... so I started hanging around old friends again... then old friends introduced me to new friends... and that lass from long ago faded further and further from my mind... then another lass came along and she needed me... and me being me needed to be needed... so I protected her from evil-do'ers and things looked up... then that lass from long ago for some reason seemed not as forelorn as she had been since she moved on...
but that is aside from the point... i guess the point <i>is</i> that im unhappy with myself... i am still an unemployed freeloader... my photography has fallen to a stagnant halt... though I <i>am</i> taking my camera into town tonight... so maybe il get some good shots... maybe il take a few prints into town and sell em off...
i unno who would wanna buy em though... 
another thing i miss is just not caring what others felt about me... just moving on when people were mad at me or something... they forget in time and shit moves on... unless it was something pertinent and <i>worth</i> making a deal about... 

w/e things have changed... time to move on and get used to this new life...
peace,
-Ian"

"event","hmm life is funny like that.. just circles and more circles like a carousel... all things you left seem to return in one way or another... 
but anywho i cant seem to rationalize a reason for writing anything on this site... or anywhere in general... but I'm bored... and not in a ""fix-the-bus mood"" or even a DAoC mood... which is really weird... perhaps il go work on my history hw that is due like... two weeks from now... perhaps not...

in the mean time;
there is a fan sans blades and a tree sans leaves... seasonaly inept... but peculiarly fitting... 
through a mirror there is a fan with its blades and a tree with its leaves... seasonaly apt... yet ordinarily discontented... 

hmm that came to me... maybe it makes sence to some one else... 

anyway i think im going to go sit outside and look for shapes in the sky... or burn out my retnas looking at the sun :b
peace,

"event","so... life has been contineuing its steadly keeping up with the fact that it apparently has to suck! haha no not really... school is being a bitch... as always... but yeah... thats nothing new... I'm contemplating actuly going to germany next year... i mean... it would be fun... its just i dont know if its worth the money... which is really whiggin me out at the moment... though i just put in an application to starbux  three minutes ago! (I really only like their chai) 
<p>
(29 hours and 16 minutes later, after walking away from typing those last words... returning to continue writing...)
<p>
ok... so i finaly got to see hannah after the longest bloody three weeks i think ive ever made it through... (i dont know why the mind makes time go slower during times of emotional craving... you would almost assume it would be quite the oppicite... but then again... who ever said what our bodys do ever made any practical sence...) and during this long three weeks ive been really concentrating on possible careers that i can actuly persue; doctor... i like helping people... and i dont get grossed out by bodly functions, but my marks in school are crap... and therefore killing my chances of med-school; chiropractics, another one in the med field... ive only twice ever had any complaints about how i manipulate back muscles and smooth them out (i do actuly give alot of back massages... mostly im taking what my chiropractor does... stripping all the 9-12 years of training... and working the muscle in a way to put it back the way it should be) ... but again... my marks arent high enough; bartender... i like my weekends too much... and i dont like alchohol or drunk people enough... coffee shop owner... would be fun for a while... buuut i dont like coffee; librarian... this is one i could do... i love books... i like helping people... i dont like exessively loud places... and i can get into a school that does library sciences; photography, ugh... i really wish i could... i just dont have the balls to get into one of my hobbys like that... i really would have liked to get paid to take pictures... but its just not consistant enough work... and it honestly doesnt pay well... great as a second job though...
im thinking of compleatly changing directions here... origionaly i was going to go to an art institute... major in photography... (but i cant make a living off of that... no matter how much i shit myself...) now im thinking of switching around and taking courses that might... allow me to expand on and become more accustomed to how a liberary works... 
maybe il find a nice big inner city liberary... settle down... live in a condo nearby, do photography as an income making hoby, and live off of that... who knows... maybe il change my mind again in another few years... months... days... and when i do... its no big deal... i still have my seniour year to not bludgeon up... and then il just go to dccc for 2 years to get my gpa up then apply to another school that will share credits so i can get the same diploma... just cheaper... cause dccc is dirt cheap... so save what i would have spent going to a realy expencive collage and save it for another 2-3 years... 
<p>
(11 some hours later... after waking up the next morning...)
<p>
uhmm this is quickly turning into the longest post i think i shall ever post on here... spanning over 3 days of my life... 
but back to jobs... i have no idea what i'll do... im sure i will find somthing... one thing i <i>could</i> do... is open up a vinnyard... family makes wine enough... i know how... and grapes are fun... 
<br>
but anywho... 
i guess il talk to y'all later... 
peace,
-Ian

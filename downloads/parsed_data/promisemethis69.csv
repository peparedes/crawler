"event","""Love and sex are two different entities and should be treated as such. You can fuck someone you love and you can like someone you fuck! Just be careful to know the difference between the two! Most girls think they have to be in love and as soon as they give it up think that they are in love.""

But, if a girl wants to have casual sex is she is considered a whore so she must find the right male have sex with because she cant have other options like guys do. 

love and sex are 2 complicated things. Girls love and guys have sex.

"event","when im in a relationship i put my feelings in hiding. I dont tell that person how i really feel about anything. I let them spill their guts but i have nothing in return. The only time i can show emotion is when im pissed. So when im mad i can cuss them out and say all these hurtful things but when im really inlove with them and cant get enough, i dont say a word. And i dont show if something hurts my feelings, its like against my own personal law to let a boy see me cry i cant let them see they they have won. I dont want ne guy to know that they have ne control over my emotions. And the leading to all of this is Dennis Falcon. YEP man of the year. He has hurt me more then ne one has ever hurt me before. And he has totally proven to me that not one man in this world is worth trusting or even falling inlove. I love scott, dont get me wrong, but its going to take a LONG time for me to actually let him in and see the person i truly am. I treat him so badly at times, and i feel awful but im not one to admit im wrong and apologize i play the tough guy and try to win every battle and if i lose im pissed. I really need to talk to someone and learn how to let these issues go. I need to see how i can get rid of this anger and hurt i have inside of me. This isnt fair to scott. Me being totally incapable of putting my gaurd down.

The most recent argument we had was because of another girl texting him and i was under the impression that he was talking to her in an intimate way (which doesnt mean sexual) and because i was so scared he was talking to another woman in such a way i literally freaked out. I cried so hard i couldnt breathe, i yelled and screamed at him,i acted a total fool...and for what? Because i let past experiences take over my brain and i made an assumption that Scott was going to hurt me the same way Dennis did. But why would he do that? Scott is so inlove me with its unreal, he would NEVER do anything like that to me. BUT because it has happened in the psat and caused so much damage to my heart and soul i felt as if it could happen again. I Have to realize IM NOT WITH DENNIS, im with someone who loves me.

EASIER SAID THAN DONE

im heading out

things are truly FUCKED UP to the point where i wanna fucking go away! 

scott is really pissing me off. i try and try and try and try and for what? to get it all thrown back in my face. i can NEVER do ne thing right. i always fuck up...

This has just been like a shitty 2 weeks. Im making a drs. appt next week so i can see what i can do to help with my stress issue. I stress over so much it causes me to feel sick to my stomach and become such a bitch and i hate feeling that way. My body is sore all the time like i got beat up and im jst so restless. like at any given time if a bet were put infront of me id pass out.
and what sucks is out of everyone i know Nick is the most understanding person and he deals with my bitchyness and doesnt hold it against me and i love him so much for that. Everyone else just is fucking ass holes. i guess thats probably why i call him my best friend lol

"event","i seriously need to stop.

i need to stop worrying all the time about everything. I need to think postive more often and stop looking at the negative aspect of things. I think thats why i get in such a bad mood sometimes cause im always stressing about things. I always feel like everything i do isnt good enough, and i was thinking about all of this last night and i think i feel that way because i was brough up that way. i was always told i could do better and i never got a pat on the back or ""good job"" when i was younger. It was always someone yelling at me telling me i wasnt good enough or verbally abusing me for everything i did. And i think my mom needs to stay out of my business now. Im 19 years old i dont need her dictating everything i do and telling me i cant do things because she doesnt like it. Thats why i need to move out. I need to able to make decisions on my own and now have to butt heads with her about every little mistake i make or if i make a decision she doesnt agree with. This is the point in my life where really i need to think about ME and what I want. Like yesterday i had no concerns with scott other then he didnt trust me and thats it. and then my mom gets home and tells me this and that and then i have things in my head that arent supposed to be there and i get all frusterated and i cry and then i say things to him and it just doesnt turn out good we almost broke up and for wat.... because my mom filled my head with bull shit. I just really need to think about how i am going to go about talking with her about how i need to be able to make my own decsions and just for her to back up and step in only if im going to get hurt or get introuble. I just need to do things on my own.

wow it felt good to atleast write all this down. i feel a lot better now <3"

I mean i just looked at mels entries and i seen how close we used to be how much we cared for eachother and now we hardly talk. I look at how much i used to be close with so many other people who arent even really in my life ne more its crazy!!!! i miss the old days BUT ive moved a lot forward with my life and cant dwell on the past. 

THings right now are even more crazy because i work 6 outa the 7 days a week. I start school on jan. 7 all i need to do is get the books and me and kalyn are looking for a place to move out to with amanda from work and her boyfriend Derek. Its crazy how things are just moving so fast. I just wish that nick was apart of all of this. he is my bestie and i wish he was starting school with me and moving out with us.. but he has his own plans and i know things will work out for him.

ok so im pretty sure that after 1st hr im a bit shocked...Sarah jsut made my day and im jsut starting to oepn my eyes a bit to life and how it should be. i cant let the little things hold me back..yeah i understand that im depressed and life isnt great but the sooner i start looking at the good aspects of life the better off ill be. im so selfish and self centered..im a spoiled brat who always gets my way when it comes to things. im just really confused right now on life in general..im sick of getting older im sick of all the damn drama and how i take things so seriously and to heart. im sick of getting my heart broken by stupid boyz and letting little petty things get to me.I have only le t one person walk on at me at times but othr then that i guess she is right i am a strong person i try not to show weakness and thats wat has caused me to feel the way i do. yeah i tried killing myself ok...i made a mistake and at that time and point i was so weak and out of control i did not know wat to do and i didnt want to talk about it with anyone but im getting help and im on medication to help me with all of thsi cause i know i cant do this on my own this isnt something thats just gonna pass by and ill be fine again this is gona take a while and i dont want it to i just want this all to be gone but its not gonna be. im gonna admitt im hurting inside..alot...all i need is support and a crying shoulder and ill be fine. There is mo more Richard in my life as a boyfriend only as a friend i can accept that i can move on..i dont want a boyfriend tho i dont wanna be hurt ne time soon i just wanna be happy and move on with my life. I have one year left before i become an adult and i have to be on my own..if i cant do all of this and im not alone wat do u think it will be like when i am alone. im not ready to be an adult and i need to start growing up...and my coun. will help me through this and so will my friends and parents. and me being mad at richard is over..i cant do it i need him as a friend and he is great supporter to me i can call and talk to em and his listens and i can he even calls me out on stuff i do so i can be a better person but the people i wanna thank the most is NICK because if it werent for him that day id be dead right now or getting a liver transplant HEATHER because she has been super nice to me thru this and has mad me laugh more then ne one Mel jsut for just bein there as a friend JEANNE for talking to me when i was down and letting me know it was ok Kalyn 4 being there and i gues family...even tho they annoy me..

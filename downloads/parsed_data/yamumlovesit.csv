i have the flu and i can't stop coughing - it could be the cigarettes :p Kate is a cracka - i just called her and she was all like  ""nick's shot"" and mumbling at me because i disrupted her rem sleeptime - then i realised it was 11am on a sunday - before noon!- sorri kate! anyhoo she just called me and can't play netball tonight coz she has to work at 5am monday - that's just cruel - i think it's time kate had a little word with the bastards who do her roster, poor kate! 
i ate so much indian last night - omg it was sooo good - i went to an indian resteraunt on oxford st for nailin's birthday dinner - he  was so not happy coz he'd been busy spewing on kial's couch, in kial's car, in the gutter, on the floor etc... we had a discussion about how family birthday parties aren't really about the person who's birthday it is, but more about parents congratulating themselves and  making you partake in redundant rituals like blowing out candles and eating cake that you are way too full to consume cumfortably.
bosnitch says hi, or he could bbe saying ""feed me you selfish bitch"" - who knows - wish i could understand cat language.
i fake tanned yesterday - quite good results - except feet area which is a little bit kumahl - you get that.
i dont want to go to bundaberg.
over and out"

"event","hey fuckers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i worked it out - it took me 10 minutes - but i finally worked out how to update this thing without the assistance of gemmaiwanttowritesuffaboutlus'mumputtingoutliston.....
anyway - netball last night was bad, i was so close to spewing i could feel the chunks rising in my throat and despite being goal shooter for 1/2 the game i managed to not shoot one single goal ...noice!...sorry kids!

i am now at julian's house, it smells like feet here...they need to vacuum..badly

i woke up early coz julain's breath smells like blue cheese that's been sitting in the sun - he needs to stop eating so much cheese - there's only so much cheese breath a girl can take!

i just checked my uni results - still no info dangit

i also received a few e-mails from the library asking me to kindly return some items that i have had in my posession for more than 6 weeks after the due date, i think the last one went something like: ""give us back the books or we'll take your first born child"" meh - stupid fucks - they wont be seeing those books till january coz i can be arsed going all the way in just to give them back, if they want them they can come and get them :P

i am dreading going to bundaberg - 4 DAYS- 4 DAYS IN BUNDABERG WITH JULIAN'S MUM AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AND A BUNDABERG WEDDING TO GO TO AND JULIAN'S EX G/F THERE! 

i really wish i wan't so fat atm - i need to lose 8kg by the weekend after next - concidering trying to purchase effidrin-basd diet pills on the net....hmm ebay?

alternatively i could stop eating junk food - we all know that's not going to happen!


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

i just spoke with julian's mum on the phone - she was calling coz julian's going to see her at the beach today..i never thought i'd say this but i'm so glad i'm working - so glad!

talk about awkward, wish she didn't hate me, or that we had even some little thing that we could talk about - like shoes - if i can't handle it for 4mins how am i going to be for 4 days?

anyone want to come to bundy with us and be a buffer?? c'mon kids you know you want to - jul's house is just down the road from the beach..and the pub - somebody? anybody?

i need a cigarette

i'll speak to you niggers soon 

hope you're proud of my superlong entry"

"event","hello my name is lu and I am a label whore.

tonight I went to gemma's house and we drank red warne, ate dark chocolate and watched centre stage.

then we went to caxton street and ate new york slice, and drank a pint while bagging people out and complaining to be old and tired.  IT WAS FUN.

that is all."

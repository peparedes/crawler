"event","It's time to move on. From multiple things. It's time to start all over again. A new car, a new job, a new way of thinking for myself. It's time for me to be happy, and thats all that matters to me. Last night I was told to forget about someone I deeply care about, and despite the pain from hearing such a thing, I just have to stand up, understand its the right thing to do, and take a step forward towards the path of moving on. If our paths meet again somewhere down the road, thats up to fate and destiny to decide. True, I can't completely forget about this person, and I wont....and we'll talk again, but not for a while....its what has to happen. Things are cleared up and now I can focus on one thing. Well with all the moving on and starting new, I figured I'll end this journal. Theres a lot of stuff in this journal from the past year, and I think I've poured as much as I can into it. I'll start a new journal, and it'll be mainly for myself, if you want to know the link just let me know. 6 months ago someone changed my life, and now 6 months from that day, my life is changing again....our lives are like wet clay, constantly changing and forming until the final design desired takes shape and and is sculpted to near perfection, but imperfections and impurities will be found, but once the clay is fired the impurities and imperfections and the near perfect design are forever locked in one uniform piece, and unless broken or painted upon, it can never change again, and so our lives are constantly changing and formed until we find ourselves and mold the perfect life, but it wont be without its impurities and imperfections, and once that final desire of what our life is to be is formed, we fire it with our souls and it is how you will be until you break and die or you're painted with the life of another."

"event","Well about 5 hours ago I experienced the following event:

Driving to work on the 118, in the fast lane, coming up to New LA Ave....my exit to go to work. Realizing I had to get over, I speed up to give myself room....but as I'm looking infront of me the guy ahead is breaking...I look over again to make sure I have room, and upon looking forawrd I notice I'm mere inches away from hitting the guy infront of me. In a desperate attempt to save my ass from a lawsuit, and get to work, I make a quick move to get over...but a little too quick. Next thing I know, my car loses control, I'm swerving, I see my car heading straight for the wall, I hit the wall, airbags deploy, and before I thought it was over, I notice I'm doing a barrel roll back out onto the freeway...after the 3rd or fourth flip, I noticed I was upside down. I braced myself for someone else to hit me, but thank god it didn't happen. People stopped, and helped me out. I guess i scraped my head on the ceiling of my car, and hit my neck on something, probably the passenger airbag. 

So they took me to Los Robles (ironically 20 years and a week ago I was born there, lol), took some X-Rays, and said I'd be fine. Everyone in my family came to visit me, including Shanna and Alex. Thank you everyone for coming, even though it was just a couples scrapes and bruises, still emans a lot to me to know how many people care about you. And for everyone else that wasn't there, thanks for callin to make sure I was ok. Anyways I left the hospital at 8, with some scrubs for clothes, no shoes, and some makeshift beanie/turban on my head making me look like some, as Ruel put it, muslim guy, lol. I have a huge bulge sticking out of the right side of my neck, and I have some kinda glue on my ear cause I guess I had a deep scratch/ shallow cut on my ear....go figure. The important thing here is that I'm alive, and a very very lucky man to have walked away from an accident like that, I thanks God it wasn't any worse. Though it does suck I'm without a car....its pretty much totaled, im going to the tow shop tomorrow to check it out, i'll try t get pics. Anyways, I'm tired, and I need to lay down get and get some rest.

By the way, my prayers go out to my friend Danny. He's in the hospital right now as well, trying to build back up his blood count....he lost a ton of blood due to a second operation for a removed appendix. The staples had opened and caused internal bleeding, and being hes a Jehova's Witness....they dont believe in having another person's blood. It's a bunch of bullshit I tell you, I dont understand how his mom can sit there with the knowledge her son can pass away and she has the power to authorize a b lood transfusion....oy, well I gotta respect their beliefs, I just hope he gets better."

"event","When Samantha broke up with me, I had so many emotions rushing through me. I said I should be an asshole, someone who doesn't care...even though it wasn't me. but, I am an asshole, and a lot of you can say I'm not, but I know I am. I went into another relationship, still weak, stil healing, still not over Samantha. And as much as I wanted to believe I was over her, as much as I could say it, I wasn't. Shanna was a wonderful, nice and sweet girl, and I feel like an asshole for dragging her into my mess. She deserves a guy who is going to give 110% of himself to her, and I couldn't do that, cause part of me was still with Samantha. So I had to break things off with Shanna last night. I had to do it for her feelings, cause it wasn't fair to her, I had to do it before we got deeper and she got more hurt. I had to do it for me. I know I made a big mistake, I know I fucked up, and I can't justify my actions, I can only admit to my faults. I didn't want to hurt Shanna at all, it was the last thing I ever wanted to do. I'm not one to want to hurt people, and even if I do, I feel horrible doing it. I learned my lesson, don't jump into things so quickly, and don't ever disimiss your feelings. Everything has been so confusing for me, such a blur, but things are starting to clear up now. I may have hurt Shanna last night, but I know I can't hurt her anymore. I know what I want, and its gonna take time before I feel that it's truly the right thing to do....but in life things happen for a reason, and whatever happens in life happens."

"event","Well today's my birthday, and its kinda weird to think that I'm 20 now. And for some strange reason, out of all my b-days, I actually feel older now. Anyways before I go off on how kick ass this week has been leading up to my b-day.....i shall update on whats been goin on.

So about a month ago, while starting to hang out with my friends of the MNK more, I started developing feelings for one of the most fun, cutest, and prettiest girls of our group, Shanna. I kinda dismissed it at first, being that our friend Ruel has had a crush on her for the past 4 years, and its just not cool to take your friends love interest...and well I wasn't too sure if she liked me either....well I could kinda tell, lol....anyways, so Ruel had me go along with him to Garden Grove and on the way we talked about girls, relationships, ect...and he goes ""so do you have any clue about who might like you?"" and I was like ""no..."" even though I knew who he was gonna say. And he goes ""Shanna, she said she likes you and thinks you're really cute"". I was like ""i knew it! well I like her too, and Shanna is a really cute girl"" and he was like ""well if you guys are gonna be happy, dont stop because of me"" So then later that night at Ruel's Valentine's party, everyone knew about Shanna liking me, and vice versa, so with the help of just about everyone talking to the both of us, we talked to eachother, and I asked her if she wanted to go on a date the next Saturday...and well from that point on I've been sooo happy and I've been having a blast. On the 1st we became official, and is just been so much fun. Shes such an awesome and sweet girl, shes done so much for me the past couple of weeks, and I can't help but smile everytime I'm with her. So anyways thats the big update, everyone (well not really everyone, I'll explain later) is happy, everyone's been having fun and its been a kick ass couple of weeks.

So last weekend started off the kick ass week leading up to my B-day. We went to the Spot for some good hookah smoking, for Melissa's B-day, my b-day, and our friend Cali's B-day. There was about 12 of us there, it was Shanna, Marvin, Erik, Danny, Melissa, Annie, Lucille, Cali and her b/f Boomer, Beth, and Melissa's friends Nicole and Chrissy, and my friend Martin showed up with two of his friends, and even though they sat at a different table, it was cool of him to go. So that was fun, we had 3 pipes goin with Caramel Apple, Caramel Cherry, and Sex on the Beach, hehe. Afterwards we all headed for Denny's, cause what's a late night out without a Denny's run. there Charles, Mindo and Ruel met up with us to say hi and chill for a bit...i've never seen so many people at Denny's it was insane.

Wednesday Samantha came over with my movies and stuff I had left at her house. It was really good to see her, and it was nie to talk to her again, and really notice how good of a friend she is. It was a bit akward, but I felt comfortable so it was cool.  Later on that night Shanna, Danny, Melissa and I went for another Hookah run at Kiss Kiss in Simi, which I actually like a lot better than the Spot, even though its smal, they're just always nice there, and the hookah is always good...cept for the one time when me and Shanna almost passed out....just dont ever get pina colada that shits dangerous!

Thursday Myrna and Keith wanted to go to the Santa Monica pier, so we had a tripple date, with me and Shanna, and Danny and Melissa. We got there and the rides and games were closed, so that sucked. So we walked around for a bit, and then ate at this bar, then went to the arcade. Me and Shanna took pictures in one of those little booth things, haha we didn't know when it was gonna start, so our firt picture is retarded, the rest are fun though, so I'll try to get those somewhere to see them soon.

Friday...for some reason Friday is a blur....oh yeah cause I dont want to remember how much money I spent, lol. I got my tax returns and well I went to the mall to get some clothes....I think thats all i gotta say, lol. OH! And earlier that day me, Shanna, and Ruel, went to LAX to go pick up Shanna's new puppy. That thing is friggen cute, its a yorky, and its about a pound and a half right now....so small...The drive there and back was insane.. 2 hours both ways! So much damn traffic...and lots of idiots too. I think the highlight is when an Ambulance wanted to get out of the carpool lane, and Shanna honked her horn. Me and Ruel were bustin up! I mean It was an accident, but the timing was so perfect, it looked like she was pissed off at the ambulance, lol...shes such a friggen cute dork.

Yesterday was my b-day thing for me and my friends (again, hehe). First me, Shanna, and Dena went to Nathan's tattoo, to go get my tattoo done. Nathan liked my design, but said it could use a little refining and re-working, and so we set up an appointment for 8 while Cullerton (my tattoo artist) worked out the new design. So wwe dropped by Porter Ranch since we were in the area. Then we went back home. Found out about Danny and Melissa not being together anymore (I'd rather not talk about it, but they're the exception to everyone being happy). And then we went back to Shanna's for our bbq. Her parents are sooo nice, they bought all the food. Her dad cooked for us. It was awesome, and I couldn't believe they did all that for me. Unfourtanately, but excitingly, I had to leave early for my tat appointment. Dena came with me, and Shanna stayed with everyone else. I was a little nervous goin in, but Cullerton was a really nice and cool guy, so it made me relaxed. He was really funny too, he kinda reminded us of a younger version of my dad haha. The way he re-designed it is just friggen awesome. The skull pretty much stayed the same, but he refined the rose, and made the spine actually look like a spine. Then he has the thorns going through my skin....its an amazing tat, and its cool to see a collaberation of my artwork and his artowrk come to life. The whole experience was a fuckin rush, it   seriously felt like someone taking the end of a paper clip and scratching it on my leg. I layed there the whole time, totally calm, talking, answering my phone (out of all times people had to call my phone the most then)...he even said he was surprised to see how well I was doin for my first tattoo. Well he found out it was my b-day, so he cut me a deal on the tat (he was gonna charge me $250, but dropped it down to $220) and they gave me a kick ass button up shirt too! The tat came out soo awesome, Dena is obsessed with it, and so am I. I can't wait to go back and get another one...its addicting.

Well that was my week, today I'm goin to the mall to get a Deftones shirt, and then I gotta meet up with some classmates for a project, then work, and then my family is comin over for cake for me hahaha....3 b-day celebrations...fuckin kick ass...alright I'm out...later.

I'll update later on with a list of things I got and thank yous, but for now thanks to everyone for makin my 20th b-day one to remember.

"event","This is random I know, but I've been listening to Incubus lately, and their songs always seem to enlighten me. Anyways, I remember when I was a kid, I'd watch TV all the time. Before I went to school, when I got home, while I was doing hw. I would sit there infront of that addicting box, and absorb all the nonsense that flickered on the screen. As I've grown older, I find myself hating TV. All the reality TV shows out there just show you how dumbed down America has become. Can you believe millions of people actually sit and watch girl after girl get discarded on a game show in order for one to become the bride of a bachelor?  Come on now. We sit infront of the TV and act as if its the only thing thats right in the world. We listen to all the media, and believe every word they say. Not paying attention to whats really goin on in the world. I seriously could go about life without TV, its nothing but an ""Idiot Box""...so with that said.....

You keep your riches and I'll sew my stitches, 
you can't make me think like you, mundane. 
I've got a message for all those who think that they 
can etch his words inside my brain. 
T.V., what do I need? 
Tell me who to believe! 
What's the use of autonomy 
when a button does it all? 
So listen up, glisten up closely all, 
who've seen the fuckin' eye ache too. 
It's time to step away from cable train. 
And when we finally see the subtle light, 
think quirk in evolution will begin 
to let us live and recreate. 
T.V., what do I need? 
Tell me who to believe! 
what's the use of autonomy 
when a button does it all? 
T.V., what should I see? 
Tell me who should I be? 
Let's do our mom a favor and drop 
a new god off a wall. 
Let me see past the fatuous knocks, 
I've gotta rid myself of this idiot box! 
Let you see past the feathers and flocks, 
and help me plant a bomb in this idiot box! 
From the depths of the sea 
to the tops of the trees 
to the seat of a lazy boy 
staring at a silver screen!"

"event","Last night a bunch of us; that would be, Annie, Dena & Jeff, Lucille, Matthew, Cristina, Melissa, Danny, Shanna, Marvin, and me, went to see our friend Danny from Midnight Drive (Optix), play his last show with the band. I dont blame him for leaving, and he might get into this cool band called The Silence, so check em out. (to prevent further confusion of which Danny I'm talkin about, my friend Danny will be Danny(f) and Danny from Midnight Drive will be Danny(b))... Anyways, the show was in Hollywood down at the Whiskey. Lets see, I got into almost 4 accidents, and should've gotten about 5 tickets, because I had to keep up with Jeff in my Mini Van. I was swerving lanes, cutting people off, running lights seconds away from being red...crazy shit. Mind you, I havn't driven the van anywhere far for a loooonnnngggg time. I had some random black girl say hi to me while driving (this comes into play later). All of that driving around was because of no parking in any of the garages down sunset...of course then we find parking right behind the damn Whiskey....-_-. We got in, right as the were goin on stage, they played a good set. Shanna, Danny(f), and Marvin liked them, so thats good. There was lots of nipple twisting between the wait for the other band, haha, I twisted Danny(f) hard, and he has nipple rings too, hahahah. (Later at Denny's Shanna got me really hard....ouch, and I didn't even touch her!) Then this band Rurik came on....really weird, but at the same time cool. The singer was asian, and wearing some yellow Japanese suit type of thing, and he danced really weird, we were all crackin up. The greatest part was at the end, they dropped hundreds of ping pong balls at us to throw at the band! hahaha, so fun, I hit the keyboardist in the head, the drummer in the head, and then I threw one at the guitarist and hit him right in the neck and he caught it, haha, it was some fun shit. After we all decided to go to Denny's...took us about a fuckin hour to get there. The traffic on sunset was insane. There were so many of us there at Denny's I think like 25. It was all of us, plus Danny(b), his two friends, Maria (who was tipsy of course), The Bako Chicks (nasty girls from Bakersfield that are in love with the band), and I think thats it. We took up two tables and a booth...insane. Danny(f), being the retard that he is, snorted salt through his nose...idiot. Matthew was throwing onions. Shanna and I kept having staredowns. Marvin was takin pics. Ahh good times. And I realized something last night, I dunno what it is, but black people were acting really strange around me last night. First it was that girl sayin hi, and then there were a bunch of guys inside Denny's and everytime I'd walk by, they'd give me this look like ""look at that cracka"". Even Matthew was like ""Dude, those black guys inside dont like you"" I'm like WTF. Then we're standing outside smoking, waiting for everyone inside to leave, and this mexican guy in a van rolls down his window and starts saying stuff, and then he busts some signs and shit, and is like ""whats up Tilo!"" and im like o_O.  We all said our goodbyes, and then headed home....well after getting gas...and just when you thought it was over. So I'm getting cash from Annie cause she wanted cigs, and I hear this black guy yelling. Then he starts walking through the gas station saying ""Fuck everyone! The fuckin White man wants it all, but the fuckin black man gets shit! FUCK! FUCK YOU! FUCKKKK!"" Annie freaked and was like ""Daniel fuckin go get your gas now cause we have to leave now!"" I was like...yeahh ok, cause I'm really worried about some drunk homeless dumbass. Danny(f) later informed me that the guy got jumped around the corner, hahaha. We got home around 3:30, and I'm fuckin exhausted. Well time for some hw...blah"

We all had a few drinks, and acted like morons, thats a given...Marvin had a tierra he wouldn't wear, cause his brother made him a princess party, hahaha. Tomorrow, er....later on today, Shawna (girl from my sculpture class last semester)and I have to go to Pomona to go get our sculptures along with some other ones...fun shit (yeah I stole your word Marvin, haha). It fuckin sucks, I can't even watch the Super Bowl tomorrow cause I have to fuckin work. How lame is that?! They should make Super Bowl Sunday into an actual holiday, it just about is. Anyways, I heard this Yellowcard song in Marvin's car, I'm really feelin it right now, so I thought I'd share it with you all...its amazing how sometimes a song can show you or explain things, you're feeling or going through...


Watching the days burning out like a cigarette, just a few drags to go. 
Built me up and broke me down somehow. 
Everything just seemed so clear to me, nothing left to know

To save us now 

And I would wait for you, if you would wait for me 
And i will wait for you, if you will wait for me 

Intoxicated, the edge is serrated, so easily torn from the core 
I blushed the first time, you blushed the last time my eyes hit your mind 
Regenerated these feelings of hatred, I long for your love evermore 
You built me up and you broke me down this time.

And Last week just sucked. Not only for me but for pretty much everyone. 

Moving on, Theres several things I want to get with my tax returns, its just a matter of deciding what i want to get

-tattoo
-car stuff
-50th anniversary Godzilla set =-p
-hookah pipe

Anyways, I'll probably get a tattoo for sure, I've always been stuck on getting a skull in the center of a rose, to kinda represent Deftones, but still have it be something that if I wind up not liking Deftones, I still have a cool tat. And the hookah pipe will be fun hehe.

Now,this may sound weird, but I've recently become interested and inspired by H.R. Giger, besides the fact that he created the alien design for Alien, he has some really cool surrealist art, and that's something I've been kinda wanting to explore, so hopefully I can start creating more than just dragons, since according to everyone, thats all I ever do.

Today I have to work taco tuesday from 4-11, I HATE THAT SHIFT!

Happy B-day to my mom, she turned 44 on the 29th.

All my money lately has been going towards food....I gotta stop before Chunk comes back, shit...


I havn't seen my spider in like a week, the dumb thing blocked himself up in his cave, I think hes molting


My addiction of cigarettes have grown, I hate it, I dont want to smoke as much as I did last week again.

I need to find a new job, actually, I need to get off my ass and look for one first. Del taco is making me fat again.

Shanna made a new nickname for me last night at the hookah bar...Danimal o_O

Some asshole decided it was necessary to add a tutor pack to my math book and raise the price to $113 from $100, i know it aint much, but I had to pay for it, and I'm not gonna use the damn tutor thing.


Yesterday I went with Marvin to bring his car to the shop, its gonna cost $8,000 to repair it....Holy shit!

On Sunday I watched without a paddle at Annie's, and bought $7 worth of junk food and a pack of cigs...wtf am I doing?

Unfourtanately I thim I'm gonna end this, haha, I can't think of anything else thats random."

Tell you I'm sorry, 
You don't know how lovely you are, 
I had to find you, 
Tell you I need you, 
Tell you I set you apart, 
Tell me your secrets, 
And ask me your questions, 
Ah let's go back to the start, 
Running in circles, 
Calling tails, heads on a silence apart. 

(Chorus) 
Nobody said it was easy, 
It's such a shame for us to part, 
Nobody said it was easy, 
No one ever said it would be this hard, 
Oh take me back to the start. 

I was just guessing, 
At numbers and figures, 
Pulling the puzzles apart, 
Questions of science, 
Science and progress, 
Do not speak as loud as my heart, 
Tell me you love me, 
Come back and haunt me, 
I want to rush to the start, 
Running in circles, 
Chasing tails, 
Coming back as we are. 

(Chorus) 
Nobody said it was easy, 
Oh it's such a shame for us to part, 
Nobody said it was easy, 
No one ever said it would be so hard, 
I'm going back to the start."

"event","I woke up today still feeling that void in my chest. The whole day I was reminded of how this could've been our 4 month anniversary, the number 25 stuck out like a death omen. I felt so angered today. Just thinking, ""why the fuck did this have to happen?!"". Theres so much shit running through my head right now. I'm thinking selfishly. Its like I'd rather stay together and break up because we can't stand eachother, or something that would make me want to leave, than to go through this shit...I'd rather stay together, and go with her wherever she goes, and if it didn't work out, have the satisfaction of knowing that atleast we tried, atleast I took a bold step and decided to take my life elsewhere, instead of knowing that we could still be together right now. For the 4 months we were together, and for all the memories she gave me, and for the amazing girlfriend she was, I would seriously give anything, ANYTHING, to be with her again. My thoughts are fucking with my brain. One moment I totally understand what happened, that shes young, that she needs to go to college still. Then the next I think why we just can't be together, and that when the time came for her to leave for college, we would figure out what to do then. And still I try to appreciate the fact that she cares so much to know that the pain I could possibly go through if we stayed together and broke up when it was that time for her to leave, would be 10 times more painful. Maybe I think too optimistic about things. I'm trying to figure out how she must feel, knowing you want something but you can't have it cause of the painful consequences. It's like if you're addicted to smoking a cigarette, you want it so bad, and you know deep in your mind you shouldn't cause it'll just end up hurting you, but you do it anyway. Im guessing, its almost the same for her, cept she has a strong will to say she wont do it. I wish she would, but then I'm being selfish, because not only would it hurt me down the road, but herself too. It sucks to now think that we can't go on for the next year and however many months, making memories as a couple. I'm still totally, and ever grateful that I can still create memories with her as a friend, but I think no matter what, I'll always long for her to be my girl again. Any other girl that will enter my life is going to have a lot to live up to. Theres been moments through out the day today, where I've been thinking that nothing happened, that Samantha is still my girlfriend and that we're just not talking for a few days. It's like I still feel we're together, yet we're not. I can't take down her pictures in my room, and I still look at her and say goodnight like I have for the past 4 months. Of course then reality takes its fat hand and smacks me upside the head. I dont know if lately I've been sharing too much, but I do know that everyday I've had this urge to write. My intentions are not to make Samantha look like a jerk, or and ass, or anything like that...its simply to just get everything out, instead of keeping it all inside like I've done in the past. I guess it's just part of my creative/artistic nature, to express myself, whether it be words, a drawing, a sculpture, or something I wear. And by sharing, it allows others to realize that there are different people out there, and maybe it will lead them to discover new things about themselves, or a whole new side of life they've been blind to. Tomorrow I'm probably going job searching with Ly, I need a job thats not going to make me smell like a damn taco, and isn't going to make me want to throw a burrito in someone's face...I need to leave Del Taco."

"event","I fell asleep last night to a soggy pillow, and short breaths. Remembering the times I caught fire, and melted in her eyes. I woke up this morning, feeling sick, as if something vital for me to live was missing. Instead of waking to the thought of another day to move on with Samantha, the first words to spill from my mind were ""<EM>shes no longer mine</EM>"". For an hour, I thought about the whole situation, and let the heavy weight of knowing; that&nbsp;the girl in the pictures above my head, was now just a friend; sink deep into my heart. As I was waiting for my alarm to go off, I realized it felt late, and looking at my clock, I realized I had 15 minutes to get to class.I threw on clothes, luckily found parking, and sat down in my desk. The feeling of the vital part of me missing carried along, and stayed with me through the whole day.I talked to Sarina, and she was as shocked as everyone else. I have to say, having friends that can listen to you is something I'm really thankful for. For anyone who has listened to me since yesterday, and took the time to comfort me in any way, I thank you. I've noticed the more I've talked, the more I've come to accept everything. After school Annie, Melissa and I had plans to go out. I picked up melissa and we went to Annie's. She decided she wanted to go to 3rd street, and though it was just last week I was there, and I was kind of iffy on retracing paths so soon, I decided why not? And as Annie said, its really not like Samantha and I ended on a bad note, and atleast we're still friends, and there will be more times to go to Malibu, or 3rd street, or just to hang out. So remembering that I still have an awesome friend helped a lot today in keeping my chin up. It was so ironic to take both roads I would take to see Samantha. Getting off on Kanan to go to her mom's house, and then taking Kanan Canyon to go to her dad's. We even passed her dad's house and I could tell I would miss all the times I could spend there with her, if I had decided yesterday to completely shun her out of my life. But she is the last person I would ever shun out of my life.&nbsp;Samantha, you&nbsp;never did anything wrong to me, and yes it did hurt to lose&nbsp;you as a girlfriend, but usually when good things end, and every good thing has an end, it's going to hurt,.&nbsp;As long as the good thing was pure, you can always look back at every single minute, and be grateful that for however long the goodness lasted, it was part of your life. And so I forgive you Samantha, because in any way you could've broken up with me, you did it in the nicest, honest and most sincere way. The fact that you cared about how I felt afterwards, and told Annie to make sure I was ok, was&nbsp;more than enough to show that&nbsp;if you could have, you wouldn't have hurt me at all.&nbsp;I wont lie, I went about the whole day today with the hopeful thought that my phone would ring with that ""I Caught Fire"" song, and she would want me back, but I couldn't totally expect it, so I wouldn't let myself down. Today was a start of a new period of moving forward, and all I can do is live each day to the fullest, and take whatever comes my way, day by day."

"event","Maybe it was better when I didn't give a fuck about anything, when I could care less about what you think. Maybe it would've been better if I never developed such a caring and loving personality, because no one appreciates it. I give, give, and give, and get close to shit in return. Sure theres times when a person I've come to know, gives back, but its nothing compared to what I do. I always give a relationship my all. I'll go out of my way to make sure everything is alright, nothing is wrong, and everyone is happy. Well I'm about ready to stand up and give a big ""FUCK YOU"" to everyone. I'm just so sick and tired of it. I'm tired of being walked over, I'm tired of not being appreciated, I'm tired of giving away pieces of my heart and seeing them thrown away. I'm tired of being that great guy, the one that everyone talks about cause of everything he does, the one that every girl says ""awwww I wish my b/f was like that"". I'm tired of worrying over people. If being an asshole is what it takes to get what you want in life, well then so be it. I tired of giving a fuck about everyone, for now on its me. For now on I'm doing what I need to do to fulfill my needs.  For now on its all about Daniel.....I feel like a fuckin schizophrenic right now....I'm just writing my thoughts. I'm both mad and sad. I dont know what to think anymore. I thought Samantha and I were a close to perfect couple. There's so many good memories with her, that I can't bear to think that shes no longer my girlfriend. Yeah, she wants to be my best friend, my friend, or just someone to talk to....but how can I do that? How can I hang out with a girl I love and not want to hug her, kiss her, or hold her hand. How am I gonna be if she finds some new guy? Just stand there and be like ""hi, nice to meet you"" as he stands there with the girl that I love.I understand she was scared, she wasn't ready for a serious relationship, but oh how I wish she would've told me that from the start. I should be grateful she still wants to be my friend though, cause shes an amazing girl that I never want to lose. And I'm grateful this didn't end cause of her cheating on me, or being a total and complete bitch. I'm so sorry Samantha, I'm sorry I brought you in too deep. I'm sorry if I overwhelmed you with my kindness and love. I'm glad you're still my friend, and that you're still going to be there for me to talk to. But I'm gonna miss you as my girlfriend. I'm gonna miss kissing you, hugging you and holding your hand. I'm gonna miss the opportunities to tell and show you just how much you mean to me. I'm gonna miss everything about you being my girlfriend. Despite what happened today, you still did make my life better. Who knows what's in the future, perhaps somewhere we'll be back together as lovers and be more than friends, just always know that I love you, and you'll always be my boutana."

"event","So I just got off the phone with my cousin Annmarie, we were talking about relationships, and I came up with the best analogy. I'm writing this cause I dont want to forget it, and who knows, maybe you can use it too. So basically, Its better to be a Magnet than a piece of velcro. Lemme explain, think of you and your significant other as two pieces of velcro. You're constantly stuck together, and it makes a bond, but you can easily tear the velcro apart from eachother, especially if the velcro gets worn out and old cause its always attached to the other side. But, if you and your significant other are magnets (and I'm talking strong magnets here), you can be separated, but theres still an attraction between both sides of the magnet, and when the two sides come together, its a strong bond thats hard to pull apart, and even if it is pulled apart theres still that attraction between both sides. And magnets dont wear out or get old. The moral here is, you dont have to constantly be attached to your girlfriend or boyfriend in order to know that they like you, and if you're always all over them, eventually it gets old and it wears down the meaning. But if you can stay without being all over eachother and still know that they like you, when you do come together its going to mean so much more and it will be so much stronger than if you're always right there next to them attached to the hip. 

I'm done with my shpeil, hope you got soemthing from it.

In a bed made of flowers 
If only tonight we could fall 
In a deathless spell 
If only tonight we could slide 
Into deep black water 
And breathe 
And breathe... 

Then an angel would come 
With burning eyes like stars 
And bury us deep 
In his velvet arms 

And the rain would cry 
As our faces slipped away 
And the rain would cry 

Don't let it end...

"event","Alright, so lets get straight to it, I am trapped inside this mobile home park. I cannot leave, and no one can get in. Thanks to a torrential down pour that has not stopped since yesterday. Easy street which connects into Los Angeles Ave, which is the road that I need to take to get anywhere is blocked off from both ends. Its flooded, there are mudslides, and unless you have a truck, the cops aren't letting you go anywhere. Today I was hoping to hang out with Samantha, go to work, and just get out and do something. Of course I can't, so I've been sitting here all day. Sitting around all day isn't too different from what I  usually do, but the only difference is that if I had the sudden urge to go anywhere, I just needed to get off my lazy ass and go. In this case, well...tough shit. I did have some kind of task to do...un-expectedly. I went outside to see if the wash was anywhere near our house...its a few hundred feet away...lovely. So I'm standing there looking, and some old lay walks over...we get into a casual chit chat, and then she asks if I can help her put a tarp up on her roof. ""Well sure, if you need it..."" So I go over there, it wasn't raining really, then I get up on the roof and within 30 seconds I look as if I went insane and decided to jump into a lake. After that, her friend comes over and asks if I can put a tarp up at her house. They both offered money, I declined cause I just can't take money from two old women cause they can't do something....but they insisted...oh well...still havn't gotten anything from it, but as long as they appreciated my help (which I'm sure they did), then I dont mind. So that was my excitement for the day. As for tomorrow...well it was supposed to be my first day back at school, but I can't go anywhere, and even if I could leave, I dont want to risk the chance of another flash flood while at school, and then I can't get home. On one hand its cool cause I get an extra day, but on the other day it totally sucks cause its the first day, and its my math class, and we all know how much I suck at math (3rd time taking the class thank you), so hopefully its just syllabus talk and nothing important (which I'm sure thats all it will be). Bleh...what a crappy day."

"event","So I took some time today, read over old blogs, sifted through memories (both good and bad), and now I'm ready to write my year reflection. This year has seen a lot of changes, and I've seen myself grow and change this year, more than any other. Last year started off with a new job at Del Taco, my first car, a diet and an unusual relationship gone bad. Most of my year, hell, most of my life for 6 months, was focused on Hayley and my Weight Watchers diet. The diet was one of the most amazing accomplishments for me in my life so far. Being able to get rid of 80 pounds of fat has made me more disciplined in doing things. I saw for the first time, that if you truly put your mind to something, keep focused, and dont give up, you can do anything.. As I look back at the time I spent with Hayley, I realize it was such an unhealthy relationship. I kept lying to myself that it was the best, that she was amazing, that everything was perfect. It wasn't though, it was far from that, sure we had some good times, but behind it all were lies, dis-trust, and atleast some level of mental abuse to myself. I never stood up to her, I always let her dictate what was going to happen. There were so many times where I should've put my foot down, but I just let it go...and for what reason? Cause I had a fear, a fear I would lose her, and that I would never find anyone else. Our relationship also distanced me so far away from the people who have been and always will be there for me, and the ones I truly loved. I was so focused on her that I started thinking that I didn't need my family anymore. I didn't need to call up my friends and hang out with them, it was always her. Towards the end of our relationship, things started to change. It's almost as if I was put through some test. For 6 months, I had to endure a horrible relationship, a shitty car, no cell phone...and if I succeeded, I got rewarded...its funny and kinda strange to think of it that way, but if it were true, I passed the test.  Everything changed so quickly, first came the new car. Out of no where, some random lady in my neighborhood, gives my dad a 1998 Eclipse, and with only a radiator to replace, became my new car. Then, again as if out of no where, and at the right time, I met Samantha...the equivalent to an angel coming to save me from what had happened (yeah that was corny). She is such an amazing person, and shes brought me back to how I used to be...someone who is always happy, never angry, and loves his family. The three months I've been with her have been so awesome, and I've made more memories with her than I have with any other girl. It's amazing to have a girl that loves my family, and loves to not only spend time with me, but everyone else too. In the month's since I've broken up with Hayley, and been with Samantha, I've seen myself become happier, and more willing to go out and do things. I've also reconnected any bonds that were broken with my family.  I also lost a friend this year, I havn't thought about it till now, but its made some kind of impact on my life. There was one day I went to check my LJ, and I saw a message from my friend Alex Trapp, who was supposed to be my partner in the movie industry, that said ""I'm giving you all the scripts, all the ideas, everything, I dont know when we'll talk, but hopefully someday we'll meet in Hollywood"". I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now I wonder, what happened to him? I thought a few weeks later he'd come back online and tell me he was just angry, but I still havn't heard from him. I'd still like to create the ideas we came up with, such as our version of Godzilla, and a fantasy film thats like a cross between LOTR and Matrix...but since then I've changed my major from 3D animation, to just an all around artist. I've noticed this year I have far more skills than just 3D animation. I saw that this year, when I made a dragon sculpture in my class, that is now in an art gallery in Pomona (another of my greatest accomplishments so far). At the beginning of the new year, I see myself growing older, I'm no longer going to be a ""teen"" anymore, I see myself being more understanding to things, and I've realized that my family is always important, and until I make my own family, they're always first priority. I know this is long alrady (I dont care, I'm mainly doing this for myself), but now I'm just gonna go through  the months and write the most memorable moments from each (including good and bad).

January- Bought my first car
February- Relationship started with Hayley
March-Turned 19
April-Spring break, got my lip pierced
May-The start of the Denny's Runs
June-My level of trust with women, destroyed
          Got a job at Spencer's
July-Got my new car
August-End of the Hayley Relationship
September-Met Samantha, start of an amazing relationship
October-I think October gets the award for best month of the year, concerts, hookah, 1 month anniversary, Halloween
November-Thanksgiving at Samantha's dad's place
December-Christmas with Samantha, 3 month anniversary, cell phone, sculpture in art show

I see the year ahead only getting better. Life is so good for me right now, I have everything I need and want. This year had its ups, and really big downs...but as the saying goes, ""Nice guys finish last"". 

And now for a random event
So Tuesday night, I drove out to Malibu, to hang out with Samantha at her dad's house. So we're sitting there, watching Anchorman, and the rain outside is getting heavier and heavier. By the time the movie was over, and while we're waiting for pizza, her dad made the decision....no one was going to drive home that night...including me, cause the storm was too rough to be driving home through Kanan canyon. So a call to my mom, and a non-argument yes from her, and I was spending the night at her dad's house. It was a lot of fun, Samantha and I stayed up till about 4 watching movies, we watched Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State, The Terminal, and the end of Scream. I couldn't fall asleep after she went to bed, I dunno if it was because I could've slept better if she was there with me, or because I felt kind of awkward, but none the less, it was awesome.

Well I hope everyone has a good New Years....Party and rock out, just be careful about it...I know I'll try, hah.

"event","Well Christmas was awesome...even though I had no idea what I wanted for Christmas, I still got some amazing things. I'll start off with the best gifts, from my babe Samantha. That girl is unbelievable, and though her gifts didn't make me cry, they're still two of the most awesome gifts I've gotten in a while. One is a 7 inch Vinyl Record of the Deftones single ""My Own Summer"" Signed by the entire band! She said I looked like a 5 year old when I opened it. The other is a picture of Godzilla, signed by the original suit actor Harou Nakajima! I totally wasn't expecting her to go and find me two collectibles from my two most favorite things. It made my gift of Disneyland look like nothing, lol. From Marvin, I also got some Godzilla collectibles, we went to the anime shop in the ventura mall, and I picked out these&nbsp;three Godzilla miniature dioramas, that are so detailed...they're really cool, and though I got two of the same (you dont know what you get in the box), it was well worth it.&nbsp;Then from my parents, I got something I was also not expecting, a new cell phone! The way the played it out was funny...they wrapped mine and Melissa's in huge boxes, and Cristina's they wrapped the original package. So Cristina opens her's first, and Melissa and I were like ""WTF!?"" and my parents said ""We figured we'd get it for her, cause she needs it the most, cause of her diabetes"". So we're like ""ok...whatever, guess thats a good reason...<EM>bullshit""</EM> So I go grab the huge box for me, and the first thing I pull out is some swimming trunks...and I give my parent's this weird look and im like ""Thanks? I guess I can go swimming"" and my dad says ""Theres more in there, they're old clothes"" and I was like ""ohhhh"" so I start digging out these old clothes, and sure enough on the bottom was my cell phone. I had another 5 year old moment...and I was too excited about it to care about my other gifts (but I did get a really nice throw blanket for my bed, and some other things). I also got a really comfortable body pillow from my uncle, an alarm clock that plays nature sounds from my aunt, a beanie from Lucille, a Hierarchy shirt from Dena....and from my great aunt....a lamp, called the Big Hue, complete with a rainbow light bulb....not only is it the same thing she got for Matthew last year, (btw, he's younger than me by about 5 years), but its from Toys'R'us...COME ON who gets a 19 year old something from Toys'R'us...yeah I know, its the whole ""thought that counts"" but I honestly dont think any thought went into it, it was more like ""oh we gotta get Daniel something...do we have any extra lamps that we bought last year?"" I think she doesn't like me, every year she gets me something that just totally doesn't fit me, isn't for my age, or seems like she could care less about getting me a gift, and if she could she wouldn't anways. Well oh well, I'm pretty content with what I got this year. Not only that, but I was able to spend Christmas with Samantha, which is really awesome, cause not only was it Christmas, but our 3 month anniversary. Oh I also got about 5 or 10 pounds added onto me, cause the food has been damn good this year, lol. And, I got two gifts for myself. One was the dragon head lamp I've been wanting, and then yesterday I bought myself a new pet, I named him Tigger. He's (or She's) a Costa Rican Tiger Rump Tarantula. It's really pretty, its all black, with orange stripes on its abdomen, and an orange carapace. I havn't held it yet cause its extremely fast, and I'm still kinda nervous...Oh and I got one more thing that I wanted for Christmas yesterday....I wanted that Mach3 power razor (the one that makes the hairs come out for a close shave), and my parents weren't sure which one I was talking about, so they gave me a $30 gift card instead....well I would've gotten it, but Samantha comes over yesterday, tells me she got me something, and after getting disapointed that I shaved, hands me the Mach3 razor with an extra box of razor heads....I swear, we're gonna spoil eachother. Well Friday is New Years Eve...that gives me a couple days to reflect on this past year, and write a blog, that also means its time for Danny to get wasted and act like a fool hehehe. I wish I could spend it with Samantha, shes having a party at her dad's house in Malibu (the bachelor house), but it just wouldn't work out with everyone being drunk, and whatever, so tough shit for me."

"event","So yesterday I went and got samantha and we went to the mall to get a few last minute gifts. Then I dropped her home so she could go to some christmas party, then she came back over to my house. We waited for melissa, who was taking forever, and had she gotten home earlier, we could've gone to Pizzatopia. As we're waiting for Melissa, I did a friggen fucktard thing....I lean over to give Samantha a kiss, and BAM! jam my knee right into her knee where she just had surgery...I felt like a fuckin Asshole! If the little baby from Meet The Fockers was there, he would've been like ""Ass....Holllleee"" ( I saw that the other day, SO FUNNY.....I also saw a shoplifting happen right before my eyes, and we had to change our freind Keith's tire on the freeway....that was the other day. I'd write a post, but this is gonna be long). Well anyways, we all were trying to find a place to eat, and we decided on Round Table. So we went there, I ate more pizza than I should have....(but luckily there were leftovers, I'll explain in a bit)....and then we went home, and then Samantha left cause today she had to wake up early to go get her stitches removed....and probably tell her they have to re-do her knee, cause her idiot boyfriend ruined it. Well this is where the leftover pizza and the Wal-Mart comes in. So I'm talking to Lucille online, and she said something and all I read was ""I'll have a drink to celebrate"" so I was like ""ooo lemme come over"" and shes like ""my house is a mess""...a little later...""im so hungry, I havn't eaten all day"" lightbulb goes off ""I have leftover pizza!"" and she says ""can I pay you for it?"" and im like ""sure, with a few drinks"" hahaha, so I went over there, brought her the pizza, and she made me some drinks. I had an Amaretto Sour, Mai Tai, 2 coke and rums, a shot of vodka, and a shot of Amaretto (I wanted to try it straight)......So I'm buzzin, Lucille gets buzzed after one drink...its 2 am, and shes like ""what the hell am I gonna do about this frame for Nonna?"" and I'm like ""i dunno..."" and shes like ""Wait, wal-mart is open 24 hours!"" I laugh my ass off and I'm like ""LETS GO!"" and shes like ""are you serious?"" and I was like ""Come on, how often to get to go shopping at 2 in the morning"" ahha, so we went to Wal-Mart, and surprisingly it was busy! We were like ""WTF?"" It was crazy. So I bought a few little things for my parents, and sisters, and a pack of beef jerky nuggets for myself. It was pretty fun, we kept laughing at everything...I even grabbed a stuffed horse (complete with saddle) and rode it, hahaha. Ah, maybe if they keep Wal-Mart open all the time, we can have Wal-Mart runs....haha kidding...I'll stick to Denny's....Well Merry Christmas everyone...hope you have a good one."

"event","Yesterday I took Samantha to Disneyland, it was a lot of fun, but there were 2 problems...1. We were both dead tired, because I decided we should leave at 6 am to get there when the park opens...and 2. Because we got there so early, we got almost all the rides done before 1, cause there was barely anyone there. We went on (lets see if I can remember)...Matterhorn, Alice in Wonderland, Autopia, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Winnie the Pooh, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, and Big Thunder Mountain. Anyways, I had so much fun with her yesterday, my cheeks were sore from laughing and smiling. The day started with me buying doughnuts for her, then getting to her house and wasting 15 cents...I got to her house at 6, and I see no lights on, and I'm like ""shit, you gotta be kidding me"". Of course i dont have a cell phone, so calling her is out of the question. I wait for a few minutes to see if maybe she was up and ready, and just waiting for me and she didn't see me yet...nope. So I start looing around for small pebbles I could throw at her window, but there were only big ones, of course. So I got some pennies, and started throwing them. After about 5 minutes, she finally woke up, if it was because of the pennies, or she just happened to wake up, I dunno, but she freaked out, and got ready in like 20 minutes. I told her if she wanted she could've taken longer, but she said no, and she looked good anyways, (i think its impossible for her to look bad, lol). I gave her the dragon shes been waiting for since we started going out, and a candle I made her too, (its good to be an artist =-p). We got to Disneyland at 8, and it didn't look like there was going to be a lot of people there. We went on Matterhorn first, and then Alice. The whole Indiana Jones from the line to the end of the ride was hilarious. First as we're in line, these 14 year old girls started talking to us about my lip ring, and piercings, and the one girl goes ""oh you know those people that get pierced down there? I heard they get a lot of feeling for the first 2 months, but after that they dont feel shit!"" haha. Then I have my arm around Samantha, and I go to take my arm off and *whappshh* right into some old lady's boob! I was like ""OH SHIT! I'm sorry!"" and the lady was all smiles and was like ""its ok""....I couldn't look back the rest of the time. Then we get on the ride, and its Samantha's first time on it, so shes having fun screaming around the turns and stuff, then we get to the one point where they're shooting arrows at you with puffs of air...she freaked out! She was like ducking her head and screaming, I was crackin up. Then we get to the big ball, and you see Indiana Jones hanging on a rope, and she starts screaming ""OMG! Is that a real person?! Is that real!? Hes just hanging OMG!"" haha shes such a cute dork =-p. Speaking about being cute, I bought her this santa hat with Stictch ears sticking out of it (we thought it was Eeyore) and she looked so friggen cute in it. For lunch We had soup in bread bowls, that were really good, but impossible to eat the bowl afterwards...I stopped after I broke my spoon sending the other half flying. We got fast passes for almost every ride, so atleast we weren't standing in lines for hours. It was so weird, unitl 1 o clock, it seemed that there wasn't gonna be anyone there, then we got off a ride, and we look and we were like WTF, you could barely walk anywhere. We went to Downtown Disney for a while to walk around and sit and relax for a while, and so we could figure out what we were gonna do for the rest of the day. After about 2 hours going back and forht between ideas, we went back to Disneyland on the monorail. We walked around for a while, and she bought us these leather bracelets with our names engraved on them. I have a black one with her name, and she has a white one with my name, heh. Then we went on our last ride, Big Thunder Mountain, which I swear, seems faster everytime I go on it. Then we ate at hungry bears restaraunt, where I had a chicken sandwhich that I could've gotten at Carl's for a dollar...but eh its Disneyland, and when you're with someone you love, who always makes you smile, and is an unbelievable person, you can't be anything else but happy. We had a blast yesterday, and though we left early, it was a loooonnnngggg day. I probably wouldn't be up right now if we left any later, as it is, I feel like I got ran over by a train. So now I'm just gonna sit around until work...bleh."

"event","So Samantha calls me tonight, and shes talking to me while shes supposedly driving home. I knew she had a lot of hw to do, and that she said she was gonna try to call me tonight, so I was glad to even be on the phone with her. I started noticing it was taking a really long time for her to get home so I was like ""where are you driving from?"" and somehow she misinterpreted my question and went on about everything she did today. Then shes like ""OMG, I just drove past this house by my house that has the BIGGEST christmas tree on it"" and im like ""hah, its probably not as big as mine"" and shes like ""i dunno, its pretty big"" and i was like ""whatever"". Then I hear what sounded like my dad talking in the phone. I was like ""did you hear that? it sounded like my dad was in the phone"" and shes like ""yeah"" and then I hear my dog barking, and im like ""thats weird I'm hearing everything on the ph..."" and then she walks into my room on her cell phone. I was like ""BABE!!!!"" Shes so awesome, she totally made my day. Here I am, thinking I'm not gonna be able to talk to her long tonight, and I'm wishing I could see her, and there she is talking to me in my room. It was such a nice surprise....sometiems I can't believe I have a girlfriend like her. Well Saturday I'm taking her to Disneyland for our 3 month anni, and her Christmas gift....it's gonna be so much friggen fun, I can't wait.

"event","Well lets have an update on my life...
Everything is just so awesome right now, and as the year comes to an end, I'm starting to realize that as I get older everything just gets better. I had an awesome Thanksgiving, with a dinner at my house with all my family and our friend Danny (hes in the band Midnight Drive, check em out)...And then that Saturday I went to Samantha's dad's house in Malibu, for another Thanksgiving dinner, which was fun with the blackouts and all, heh. I had some damn good food that weekend, and I was pleased to not have to do any point counting =-p. Thanksgiving also marked mine and Samantha's 2 month anniversary. Shes beyond amazing, and with a present that she says is going to make me cry for Christmas, I couldn't be happier, and more grateful to have a girl like her. God I love her =-)... My dragon sculpture, which I worked on for about 3 months, is being featured in the National Museum of Ceramics show in Pomona this month. This is friggen amazing....my teacher chose my work, and two other students in my class to be featured in this show. We were all asked to put a price on our sculptures, and heres where I have a dilemma. My teacher said mine would probably sell for $500...wow...$500 for my work....thats awesome, but I dont want to sell it! After putting so much work into it, I dont think I can just give it to someone else for $500. I'm still thinking about it thought, It would be good money, but I dont know if I can let go of my sculpture. The other night Samantha and I went to this Orchestral concert at the college (I had to do it for my music app. class)...and we actually had a really good time. The orchestra was really good, and its really amazing to see how all the players with their instruments can come together and produce this loud and amazing music. There were some funny things though, like this belly dancer that came out and had a jiggly stomache (it looked really gross)...the other dancers trying not to fall, a baby bumping his head hard right into the stage...and this really old guy playing a violin with a stomache that looked like it was carrying a baby, lol. On the downside of things...I'm really not looking forward to next week...not only is it finals week, but I have several projects that are due. My schedule is something like this....

Monday: Nothing, my only free day...but I'll be doing lots of stuff for my projects and studying
Tuesday: I have to drop my sculpture, along with Shawna's sculpture off at TO at 9....go to a counselor appointment at 11, then my bio test at 4 and then work from 5:30-11 O_O
Wednesday: My final project for 3D animation is due, and I have my Music App. final, and I have to turn in two concert reports
Thursday: Biology final...unless I somehow get a B on the test Tuesday
Friday: Ceramics final project due

So if you happen to talk to me next week and I try to rip off your head, the above is the reason why....thank God it ends Friday.

Well thats pretty much it...After the semester ends I'm planning on a huge Denny's run...cause what better way to end the semester than to sit at Denny's with your friends eating Denny's haha...if you wanna go, let me know and I'll figure out when everyone can all meet up one night....well I'm out..."

"event","Well Samantha and I decided to take a break from talking to eachother on Sunday, to see how things would be in our lives without eachother. We agreed to talk again on Wednesday, but it turns out we couldn't wait that long, and we both realized without eachother things just feel wrong. I became angry with everyone, and really tense and stressed out knowing that I couldn't talk to her till Wednesday. It was so hard to stop myself from just saying hello to her when she signed on last night, and the whole day today I kept thinking to myself ""tomorrow I can talk to Samantha again!"". I didn't even have to wait, I got home today and Melissa told me that there was a note from Samantha on my dresser under her photo. She went to my house while I was at school, to give me a letter that made my heart stop, when I read ""...Things don't feel right, and I have noticed that I have not been myself, because the image of ""myself"" is being with you."" I sat for a while, thinking of what to do, and I was like ""wtf are you doing? get your ass over there!"" So I jumped in my car, stopped to buy her a rose, and surprised her at her door. For some odd reason I was out of breath, and I was just overwhelmed with this emotion, and the thought that here is a girl that makes me infinately happy and truly cares about me. It didn't even matter to me that I couldn't stay long, just to to see her face and kiss her was enough. She is without a doubt, the most amazing girl to have graced my life so far, and I can't begin to explain the way she makes me feel. Thank You Samantha, for being the kind of girl you are, I <3 you."

"event","Tonight I went with Samantha and her friends, Erin, Shannon, and Kaitlyn (sp?) to go see Deathcab For Cutie and Pretty Girls Make Graves. We got to the Wiltern, and it was the oddest site for a concert, virtually no line, and it was about 2 hours before too. We parked and decided to go to Denny's (it's like connected to the Wiltern). We were laughing so much, at the most stupid things too, lol, like Samantha couldn't control herself over the fact that Erin has no tear ducts, which in turn made Erin start laughing, and cause of her lack of tear ducts, she starts crying, haha, oh man. We'll we were all being retarded, then we started getting impatiently upset, as it took a whole friggen hour to get our food! WTF? The whole time we were there we never saw the line reach the door to Denny's, infact by the time we were done, everyone was inside already. We came upon a dilemma once inside...I had a floor ticket, and everyone else had seats. We went through a bit of negotiating and traveling back and forth before we finally figured out what to do. Thanks to Samantha, her and I we're both able to go on the floor level, and everyone else was cool with staying upstairs, as long as they all had their seats together, eventually they made it down to the floor too, so it was all good. The first band to go on was Pretty Girls Make Graves....they were awesome!!! I was amazed at all their songs, and the singer was so good, and she had a crystal clear voice. Amazing band, their drummer is awesome, and the guitar was just amazing...looks like I'll be adding a few more CDs to my collection. After they're awesome set, Deathcab took the stage. They were alright, a little more mellow, and the guy's voice is kinda weird, its kinda high and sounds like he needs to clear it or something. They were good, a couple songs I really liked. During their ""last"" song, Samantha and I went out to avoid the rush of people after the show, and so we can meet with the rest of everyone. The ""last"" song went on for like 10 minutes, and then a few people started coming out, and then we hear cheering and of course that means an encore. The encore lasted almost another 20 minutes! And the songs seemed to just drag on, we were like ""what the hell is going on?"". Eventually the show ended, we found Shannon, Erin, and Kaitlyn and we headed home. The whole way home the car was filled with sounds from this somewhat inside joke...that requires saying a word in a high pitched monotone voice...almost anything they saw, they would say it in this voice, lol, I think the funniest one was ""Miles per hourrr"" hah.. Well we had good times, and it was good getting to know some of Samantha's friends a little more. Blegh, tomorrow is nothing but school work to do, god damn shiet...oh well, such is life."

"event","What is happening to Halloween? Its bad enough it wasn't a cloudy October night (no instead we get a crystal clear, cold windy night), but this is really sad. What happened to droves of kids dressed up hunting for candy? And whats with all these houses shutting down at 8 o clock? Its my favorite holiday and it really sucks to see it disappear, maybe it's cause I'm older, I dunno. Well I still went all out for my costume, I think it was my best attempt yet. My werewolf costume included a prosthetic face piece (that I bought last year, painted it grey (it was brown) and I replaced the rubber teeth with dental acrylic ones), wolf contact lenses, an under-armour shirt with fur attached, a chest piece made out of a manican, home made fur pants, home made claws made from translucent sculpey, and a load of grey make up. I'll try to get the pictures up today. Well I put on the whole costume, and I drove over to Samantha's...kinda a pain in the ass driving there with claws and stuff, lol (i lost about 5 on the way there). Samantha was freaked out, she couldn't look at me, and was like ""omg dont touch me, you're soooo freaky"" haha. She was dressed up as a sexy pirate again, and her sister was a witch. And I met her sister's b/f/ex Sean, whos a really cool guy, he was dressed as the ""chaperone"" haha. We waited for Samantha's little brother John to get home, so we could go to her uncle's, and then go trick-or-treating. They all wanted me to scare John (hes 10), so he rings the door bell, and I open the door and I'm like ""RAH!!!!"" and he goes ""Oh, hi Dan"" and just walks in, and I was like -_-, oh well. We went over to her uncle's house who had a really cool set up outside, there was a dead pregnant bride, and the girl from the Ring, and some other things I couldn't see, but it was really cool. He was impressed by my costume, but it sucks that his first impression of me was as a wolf, haha. After we went back to Samantha's and we went out trick-or-treating. Besides scaring a few people when the opened doors, and getting tons of compliments about my costume (I had one lady ask me if I worked for a movie studio, score!)...it was really sad. It felt as if we were the only ones out there, it was so quiet outside, and houses were shutting down early and stuff, but it was fun trick-or-treating, for probably the last time until I have my own kids. Sadly my costume started falling apart, the claws had fallen off while driving, but half way through our walking Sean goes ""dude, you're pants are falling apart back here"" and I was like ""oh shit"", So the three of them are all looking at this split running up my ass (I had clothes on underneath, it wasn't bare!) and laughing at me, and so the rest of the way I had to walk with my but clenched and kinda wobbled so it wouldn't tear anymore, I guess getting in and out of Samantha's car did it, I thought I heard a big rrrripppp when I got in, lol. I got an alright supply of candy for the rest of the semester (to keep me up in class haha), so all in all it was fun, could've been better if there were more kids out, but oh well. Next year I'm gonna have to plan something big, keep the Halloween spirit alive.

And I know this is a really long blog already, but I gotta give props to Sarina's party on Friday. I dressed up like Jack Sparrow (I even had some little girl say ""Hi Johnny Depp!"" when I got outta my car), Samantha was a very sexy pirate, Katie was a priest with her little schoolboy Sarina (HAHAH), and then the best was Seth and Melissa. We're sitting down on the couch, when the door opens and I see this tall Sally holding the hand of a little Jack Skellington leading him into the house, hahaha! Yeah Seth was Sally and Melissa was Jack from The Nightmare Before Christmas, it was great. Well Sarina did a good job on decorating, and made some good eatings too. We watched Robin William's new stand up movie, and then Samantha and I left, cause she was getting tired (poor babe, had school and work all week). But it was fun, so Thanks Sarina!

Well I think I'm done, I'll figure a way to get some pics on here...and now a song to end this...

Bonfires burning bright 
Pumpkin faces in the night 
I remember Halloween

Little Dead are out in droves

Where skeletal life is known

This day anything goes 
Burning bodies hanging from poles 
I remember Halloween

Candy apples and razor blades

"event","Today Samantha and I celebrated our one month anniversary, technically its on Monday, but as of today (or yesterday) its been 4 weeks. Anyways, we had a really fun time together today. She came over and we exchanged gifts we had for eachother. She didn't even want to give me her gift cause she thought it would be nothing compared to what I had for her, but it's the thought and the act of giving something to celebrate a month of good times and memories that really matters. She got me this awesome green and grey Volcom beanie, and I drew her a drawing that had to do with one of our songs, and framed it with a fur background. I've never seen anyone be so happy about a piece of artwork i did for them, and it made me feel so good. A little later she treated me and my sister to lunch at Rubio's. When we got back, I tried to take a nap but I wasn't quite able to, cause she'd either start tickling my ears or some weird stomach sound would startle me, haha. After trying to nap, I started on my next task...dinner. I decided instead of going out to a restaraunt, to cook her dinner myself, so I made chicken parmagian....samantha took some good pics of me cooking and stuff so I'll try to get those on here soon. After cooking for nearly 2 and a half hours, we finally sat down to eat, and I was quite impressed with how well I did. It was fuckin delicious, but I think I made just a bit too much pasta and chicken...either way it was good. After dinner we headed over to Dena's for her b-day. We had a lot of fun there, and the way Samantha is with my family and the way they are with her is just so awesome! It feels as if we have all known her for such a long time, she gets along so well with everyone. I dont think there has been one time she's left from my  house without saying how much she loves my family, that is so fuckin great! Well Im really happy to be with her, and this month feels like its been atleast 6 or 7. This is easily one of the happiest months i've ever spent with anyone. Ahhhhhhh its great..."

"event","Alright, so after 2 weeks of not being able to go with Katie to see Ours, I finally went tonight, but it friggen figures that the show was canceled!! But the night did prove to be interesting. I met up with Katie, Sarina and Allison at Taco Bell, after getting food there, getting gas, getting food at subway for Sarina and Allison, we headed towards Hollywood. Once there we headed to the Tattoo shop across from the venue, so Katie could get her Tattoo finished. If it wasn't for my logical side reasoning with my spontaneous ""do it now"" side, I swear I'd have a tattoo right now on my wrist. The temptation was so strong, all I had to do was pull out my brand new credit card and bam. But then I though ""yeah and can you pay the bill for using your credit card"" and at this point in time no I can't, but I think next week I'm gonna go ahead and do it. Well Katie got her tat done, and we went across the street to the venue. There was virtually no line, and people were just kinda standing around. So we're trying to figure out where we're supposed to be, and some guy says ""The Jimmy Gnecco show has been canceled, Jimmy said his throat hurts"". Well how fuckin ironic that is, I finally go to see him play, and he doesn't show up. Well we had nothin better to do, and we weren't gonna drive back home, so we walked down Hollywood Boulevard. We Stopped in this incense/smoke shop called B&W imports, it was a really cool place. I saw a Hookah bar sign in the window, and I was like ""Cool! I wanna try some, who wants to?"" Katie and Sarina were like ""nah, just go try it yourself"" but Allison was cool and came along. I went up to the guy and asked him for the price, and he said ""5 dollars"" and i was like ""ok, cool"" and he goes ""ok lemme go see if its set up, i'll brb"" so he goes and comes back and says ""ok, just follow me, hes going to give you it for free cause its not open tonight, but its ok"" so we're like ""awesome!"" and we went in, it was this cool little backroom, that looked kinda like a old western kinda thing, and the guy was like ""I'll give you two, so what flavors would you like?"" I asked for the Cherry and the Melon. This was really cool, we were getting two hookah pipes for free. The guy owned the place, and he was really cool, Katie and Sarina joined us, and he was showin us pictures of how the place originally looked, and some movies that had been shot there. It was a really nice welcoming atmosphere. The hookah was good! It actually tastes sweet, and leaves a ncie after taste on your toungue. It was smooth too, I liked it so much I almost want to get my own hookah pipe, haha. Katie kept making me laugh while I was smoking, and I kept shooting clouds of smoke out everytime, it was pretty funny. Afterwards we walked further down, stopped in a sex shop, another tattoo shop (where katie got the first part of her tattoo done), stopped so katie could pet some homeless persons cat, stopped in a McDonalds, saw an asian dragging a wooden cross, and saw some weird monkey thing in a window.That was pretty much it in Hollywood. After, we drove to Denny's in TO, where I had my most interesting Denny's Run so far. I won Samantha a halloween baby in the claw machine on my first try, haha. Then we were seated down at this huge booth, but there was only four of us....we didn't think anyone would share the booth with us...but oh contraire...As we're sitting waiting for our food, I see one of the Denny's guys put two menus on the table in our booth (it was separated from us, but there was something to connect the table to us, essentially, its the same booth). I'm thinking to myself ""you gotta be shitting me, someones gonna be sitting next to us?"". Yes there was, and to top it off, it was two drunken dumb fucks. We were all like ""ohhhhh shit"" We got our food and pretty much stayed quiet as we listened to what they were saying...Katie kept trying not to laugh. The guys got worse as time passed on, getting ouder, and trying to interact with us (well atleast Katie). One of them pretended to grab for Katie's fries, and the other one kept repeating his story about getting kicked out of somewhere and telling the guy to ""go home to his fat wife""...right...well we left, a bit shocked, and a bit amused. All in all, it was a very interesting, fun, crazy night. Fuck that's a long entry....blegh...sculpture class in 6 hours...I gotta sleep."

"event","Well unexpectedly the other day, Melissa tells me ""guess where you're going?"" and im like ""uhhh, i dunno"" she gets all excited ""You're going to see The Used!"". Well I could've showed a little more excitement but it was so sudden, but anyways I went and saw The Used last night at the Ventura Theater....holy shit. Right now I feel as if I played football last night. Being 80 pounds lighter in a mosh pit is insane! I was being slammed around like every other motherfucker in there, I even fell a few times, thats a first, lol. I dont have any visible battle scars, but my arms are sore, as is my thigh cause some fucktard slammed his fist into it, and nipped one of my nuts...that was during Atreyu, and I got out at that point. Well speaking of the other bands, it was The Bronx (bleh), Head Automatica (alright, wacky, but alright), Atreyu (awesome), and The Used (WOW!). As I said, the first two bands were kinda eh, Samantha would've liked head automatica, but they were all dressed up in really tight suits, kinda weird. Atreyu was crazy. I really never heard them before, and I kick myself for that. The pit was insane for them, I was only able to stay in it for like 3 songs. I'm gonna have to get their albums now though, good shit. And The Used...God I wish Samantha was there with me...I was gonna call her during I Caught Fire, but I had called her earlier and couldn't hear a word she was saying and I think I heard her say she was gonna go to bed, so I didn't wanna wake her up, especially with loud music....but when they did play that song I rocked my heart out for her, such a great song. They put on a pretty good show, I've never seen a singer look as happy as Bert did, he was enjoying himself as much as everyone else was. The pit got crazy for a couple of songs, but they did play a lot of their mellow songs last night, so that was kind of a let down. They were still awesome last night, and of course the Ventura Theater makes it that much better. I'm still kinda disorientated right now, so excuse me if any of this seems random, out of place, or hard to follow....damn, and Katie wants me to go with her to see Ours tonight at 12....O_O"

The original plan was to go to a restaurant, but there were too many people, so they ordered food from an italian restaurant (of course). Her grandpa just about twisted my hand off and pulled me over the couch when he shook my hand (he was drunk...). But everyone was so cool, I felt unbelievably comfortable there. Her dad is actually a really nice guy, hah, he even offered me wine (I didn't have any, but I did have a raspberry smirnoff later....good shtuff). We watched that movie Envy with Jack Black and Ben Stiller, it was funny, but really weird. We kept laughing at her grandpa who kept falling asleep and snoring, then her grandma would wake him up and he'd be like ""Whattt?"" and go back to sleep, haha. Samantha is by far, the sweetest girl, she makes me so happy its crazy. *sigh* You ever get that feeling that everything is just right? Well thats the feeling I get whenever I'm with her.

Heh, and I bought some pumpkin pie for dessert, Samantha's favorite, hehe. I had a good time, I felt so comfortable with her family, it was like having dinner at my aunt's house. She makes me so happy, I dont think there is one moment I'm with her that I'm not smiling or laughing. Friday she wants me to go to her dad's house...I hope he doesn't break my balls *gulp*, haha. 

On Monday I took Cristina to go see Shark Tale for her b-day, it was a good fun, and funny movie, good one for the kids (even though shes 15, lol, hey we both enjoyed it).

Tuesday I worked my last hours at Spencer's. I gotta $10 tip from a filipino woman for helping her bring shelves to her car, and I took it and bought lunch for everyone. We're not supposed to take tips, but it was the last day, so I really didn't care.

Well I'm planning a Denny's run as of right now, so I must be goin.....gonna have to go cheap this time around, low on cash."

"event","Last night was the Nintendo Tour Concert and it kicked so much ass! It was Letterkills (which I like, they're pretty good), My Chemical Romance, Lostprophets (Who I didn't know were playing till yesterday LOL), and Story of the Year. WOW It was fuckin awesome! Samantha and I had SOOO much fun, I a had a blast watching the concert with her. We had seats up in the balcony, and they were actually pretty good seats. We sat through Letterkills, but we enjoyed them. After they played we went downstairs to go buy shirts, I bought her a red Letterkills shirt with Marilyn Monroe on it, and I bought a MCR shirt for myself (though I tried it on, and I swear its not a Medium, they must've put a medium tag on a small shirt, dammit) Then we went back up, and MCR came on and we both jumped up and started screaming and singing. They put on a good performance, but Gerard's mic was messed up and you couldn't hear him that well, but still they were good. Then Lostprophets came on...Holy crap...me and Samantha both agreed that when they sung Last Train Home, it was the best song ever seen live. The whole damn place was singing along and waving arms, and jumping up and down, it was fuckin great. They were so good, like cd quality good. During the intermission between LP and SOTY, we were teasing eachother and then she dubs me with the name ""Floppy""...I'm like ""WTF?!"" haha but whatever, I'll get a name for her...right Bouncy? haha. So then SOTY came on...WOW so much fuckin energy, I can't remember between what songs, but they did a cover of sweet home alabama, that song from city of angels, and some other songs that I can't remember, but it was great. We left during SOTY though, because one, it would've taken us forever to get out if we waited for the concert to end, and two, Annie, Lucille, Dena, Jeff, Melissa, and Maria, were all waiting outside by MCR's tour bus, so we thought we were gonna meet MCR. We didn't though, but I was starved and we all went to Denny's. I couldn't believe it, it was Samantha's first time at a Denny's, when she told us that earlier, everyone was like ""WHAT?!"" haha. I ate so much fuckin food, I had the lumberjack slam (which is 3 pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 pieces of bacon, 2 pieces of toast, scrambled eggs, and hash browns), along with some mozzerlla sticks, and the rest of Samantha's club sandwhich...ohhh man, it was so good. Maria and Melissa are definitely the crack ups out of everyone. Maria kept looking at Samantha and making this like ""nrahnrahnrah"" sond.(thats the best I could do) And melissa grabbed this mask we got in these give-away bags, and kept sticking out her toungue and being a dork...then she proceeded to fart in the elevator...thank God it didn't waft around to us, lol. Samantha is just fuckin awesome, she blends in so well with all of us, and I have sooooo much fun with her. We all had fun, I can't wait for the next concert (whenever that is). And now that I have my new concert buddy, we'll be goin to lots of concerts...fuckin great...Ahhhhhhh well I'm supposed to be in my music class right now, but I woke up too late, and too out of it, so I'm just waiting for my 3D class now. Its gonna feel weird not going to work today, probably a relief, but strange. I'm gonna use the time off today and take Cristina out for her B-day. I can't believe my little sister is 15, shes grown up so quick. Well im out...

Among the other fraternities and sororities, I think her sisters was one of the best....and there were so many damn girls in her sorority too, insane. There were so many people there though, we couldn't even leave cause the stairs were filled with people. Then we realized there was a door upstairs about 2 rows up, haha. I met her dad, couldn't really carry much of a conversation, but he did say ""I didn't get a chance to break your balls, but next time.."" shit...well he is Italian, can't blame him, hah. I also met her sister, and her funcle (fake uncle), and her mom and brother earlier...they all seem like really nice people (her dad included) hopefully next time I can get to know them better. On the way home we had a crazy conversation about guardian angels, dreams, visions, abductions, ghosts...of course my stories were about everything but the guardian angels, and shes looking at me like ""weirdo"", haha...I guess I shouldn't have told her that I once saw a demonic cat walk into my room at 3 years old, while wide awake and not sleeping...I swear though, I wasn't sleeping! I was actually up watching this cat come into my room, and then grow and have glowing green eyes, and coming towards me...dream or not I was scared shitless...but anyways...So today is our one week anniversary!

So after buying the aforementioned new clothes (which includes 2 pairs of jeans (wow jeans...its been like 2 years) and 2 new shirts), we all met up at the bowling alley. It was Angie, Josh, her sister Shelley and her friend Brittany, and her other friend Justin, along with me, Marv, and our friends Kevin and Castro...much fun. Kevin kept goin for the lowest score, haha, that italian moron. Josh and I pretty much bowl the same, all power little skill, heh, and Angie just walks up and kinda tosses the ball...and still manages to get strikes, go figure. Afterwards we all went to In N Out. It was fun hanging out with Angie and Josh again, definitely gotta call them up more often. Looks like its going to be a good weekend...tomorrow I'm going with Samantha and her mom to see her sister's sorority perform a lip sync at her college, and then Sunday we're going to the Nintendo Fusion Tour concert!

So heres what happened...last night Annie had a kickback at her house for her friend Maria's b-day. So she wanted to have me and Samantha go, so Samantha met me up at work and we went to Annie's house. Well Annie was already tipsy, she was hilarious (Samantha got some great pics of her, haha). But we all just sat outside and chilled. Everyone was drinking (well not Samantha, she had to drive home), and just having a good time.  Well it came for the time for Samantha to leave, so I walked her out to her car, we hugged and kissed, and then (as far as I can remember) I said ""listen, I want us to be more than this"" and she said ""like what with a title?"" and im like ""what do you mean a title?"" and she goes ""like boyfriend girlfriend?"" and i said ""yeah, cause I really like you, and you make me happy"" and she said ""i like you too"" and she was smiling and laughing (cause i was buzzed) and so now we're together. I woke up feeling so happy, despite the fact that it was 6:30 when i woke up, but I couldn't help but smile.

Of course I can't help but relate this to a song, its not how the song actually is, but these parts of it and the way Chino sings them pretty much sums it up for how I feel. heh.

We at first went to watch the volleyball game, I met her friends, and we sat and watched Agoura get killed by TO. We left about half way to go the football game, to once again see Agoura get their ass handed to them, this time by Rio Mesa. Haha, I'm such a friggen dork, no really, we're walking to the stadium, and I go ""so hey, is it cool if we hold hands?"" and she just starts laughing, and shes like ""haha what kinda question is that? hah I mean yeah we can, but why didn't you just grab it?"" and im like ""I dunno! i wasn't sure if you'd be like ""what the hell?"""" and she just laughs, of course in my mind I'm slapping myself...idiot. Well so we sat through about 3/4 of the game, and then we left to get something to eat. We went to Jack in the Box, ate, and then she drove me back to my car. And her quote of the night ""I've never kissed a guy with a lip ring before"" haha, ah good times.

"event","Well Ly and me, being the bored people we are, decided on another Denny's run (2nd this week....lol). This time though, we had a dilemma. Her car was in her garage, therefor she couldn't drive cause it would wake up her parents, and my car was acting up all day and the check engine light was on...so how were we gonna get to Denny's? Well we asked Marvin, but he was like no, so we asked our friend Martin. The whole beauty of our Denny's runs is that it involves sneaking out at a late time (well not for me)...and what Martin has to do is great. He has to wake up his dad sleeping on the couch, get him to bed, then steal his parent's car...hah. He pulls up and I'm like ""why are yo driving with your high beams?!"" and he goes ""I dont know how to turn them off"" hahaha. Ok so we get to Denny's, me and Ly ordered strawberry shakes as a base for our ""water"", and martin ordered a rootbeer float (maybe he wanted to atleast think he was drinking something with an alcoholic name, hah) and we all shared a Sampler platter. And so the drinking began...Ly didn't like the way the malibu rum tasted with the shake, so she gave me hers, didn't drink any more rum, and that left me with the whole water bottle full of it. After I finished the shakes, I just took it straight....the whole 1 pint bottle was gone...haha. I was buzzin, singing to songs, laughing loud, saying retarded things (doesn't sound too much different now does it? haha). Yeah, well it was fun, got home at 4 and passed out. Martin is a nice addition to our runs, and besides, the more the merrier. Right now im all disorientated and out of it...from the lack of sleep, and from this cold that decided to infest me last night, blah...well I gotta go get myself a job at Vans today."

My second plan was to go the valley with Dena...of course trying to plan anything with her and going at a specific time is impossible. I thought we were gonna leave around 2 or earlier, but we wound up leaving at 5. Annie came along with us, and my whole plan was to first go to Vans and see about getting a job, then go to Nathan's (tattoo shop) and see what kinda lip rings they had, and then go to the northridge Mall and exchange my dragon lamp. Well at first they were like ""you enver said we had to go to the mall"" and i was like ""you gotta be fucking serious, I've been waiting all day and now you're complaining cause I want to go to the mall, which was what I was gonna do in the first place"". Eventually we did, then we went to Nathan's, they had a shitty selection, and it was pricey, and they were all assholes, so I did't get anything. I came home, Melissa took over the computer even though I was signed on to AIM, not like it mattered cause no one was on to talk to. No body was home to hang out with. I fuckin just sat there doing nothing, went outside and smoked, had some upsetting thoughts run through my head. Got depressed. Called Samantha, but she was getting ready for bed...Called ly, talked to her bout her shitty weekend, then we made a plan for a Denny's run.

I've never been as angry as I was Monday, but besides that Monday was actually a particularly good day. Once more I realized how good it feels to have friends you can talk to, who will listen and are there to help you. Later on that night Ly, Diane, Marvin and I all went to Denny's. There was no camera this time (dammit!) but I enjoyed spending a few hours with my closest friends. So what started off as a horrible day ended in a good way.

My Biology class is like a mix of bio and chem, but shouldn't be too hard, the teacher is some tall old nut, like mr.rogers on crack with a beard, haha. I think I'll like Bio, Marvin, Myrna and Keith, and my friend Hamayan are in the lecture part of my class, then Hamayan is in the lab with me, so atleast I know some people. My intro to 3D animation teacher has a german or hungarian accent, but she seems cool and I think I'll learn a lot more in this class as opposed to the other 3D class I took last year. It looks to be a really awesome class, she said she'll be taking us on field trips to studios, and having people from the animation world coming in to talk to us. My art class with Dena and her friend Jeff, was today. Thats the supposed 6 hour one, but looks like I counted my hours wrong, and its only 5. Still though, thats long, but today we got out early. OUr teacher is a bronze sculptor, and shes kinda weird, but I think she'll turn out to be an interesting teacher.

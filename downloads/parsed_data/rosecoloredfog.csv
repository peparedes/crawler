"event","I remember coming here
This was unchartered territory 
A place I never knew 
Something I had always seen 
But walked on by
If I needed to find you,
I knew where you'd be
Crouching within a seat somewhere
Lonely, pale and fragile you were
I just wanted you free
Free from all the torment that the world couldn't see
Looking around I see you in it all
I see us walking in the doors laughing and enjoying each other's company
I see you against the wall with your laptop and free time
Meeting you after work and worried about your well-being
I see all of us together meeting your parents.
Everyone came together just for you. 
Outside we sat with your dad. 
I've never seen such quiet worry across someone's face the way I saw it displayed.
I see myself at this very table, so lost and confused. 
It's hard coming in here without flashing back to what seems so long ago. 
At some point we have to free ourselves from the jail we trap our mind in.
For some reason, this part of my memory is very cozy."

"event","For some reason, ever since my roomie said she saw the movie ""Amy"", I have been obsessed with learning everything about Amy Winehouse. I haven't seen the documentary yet, though I will. I feel as if I relate to her longing for her love of her boyfriend/husband and how dramatic she makes it. The strong emotions she portrays in her music exemplifies how strong the pain is at times in my mind and heart when I spend to much time thinking about B. In some ways, I feel like I resorted going back to a black period, such as her song ""Back to Black"", but I know haven't in comparison to previous behaviors, which were really black, with previous breakups. It's really hard detaching from this idea of him and i together, what i should be and so forth because he's still so invested in my life. It's my fault. When I could have had space, I begged for his company. Now he's oblivious to my suffering and involved in my life and I can't tell him I need space in fear destroying the possibility of us getting back together, though this will never happen. Even if it could, it wouldn't be right. I know this, but I have lied and deceived myself so much, I feel like I have entrapped myself. I want to stop living in this misery and do something with it. I want to create art, in whatever way that looks like."

"event","i have probably stated this before, (probably...meaning indefinitely) but I freaking hate dating. I haven't encountered any stupid mistakes yet, well, meaning I haven't made a fool of myself, but I hate the over-analyzing that comes along with dating. I met this guy at his workplace because he's a bartender and I started ""stalking"" him because I fancied him. Of course we hit it off and I got his number and we hooked up in the same day. I made him breakfast and coffee the next morning and that was it. It was really nice. He seemed to really enjoy my company, as I did his. As we left he said he wanted to hang out again. Playfully I told him I would think about it, but I really meant I wanted to spend time with him again. Truthfully I do not feel any sort of pull to him and <u>really</u> aspire to get to know him more, I think I'm just lonely. I want to feel wanted. Reasoning behind the acknowledgement is because this occurred Sunday and it currently being Tuesday, I have yet to hear from him haha I can absolutely text him myself, but because I'm attempting to be cautious in relations I develop, I (in my core) know that it's not beneficial to entertain this. If he is to text me, I will pursue whatever comes but I need to not go after something just because I'm lonely and <b><i>that</i></b> is haaaaard to change within me. 
Ex-beau is in the hospital, again; first time in eight months on the other hand. He went in last night and he told me he would call me but he has yet to call me. It really upsets me that he hasn't called me. I'm upset for selfish reasons and I admit that. I just want to be there for him. I want him to depend on me, but so he can see how dependable I am which will remind him how great I can be and influence the desire to get back with me. Sickening, I know it is, but I miss him. I hope one day I can realize that seeking relations with people who are constantly in need is not healthy and I hope one day I will encounter a long lasting relationship in which my partner is completely emotionally supportive to and for me as I to them and we can strengthen and empower one another. One day. Until then, Michael's still going to be around. He's been blowing me up!"

"event","if my 18 year old self could see this far into the future, I'm afraid I never would have chosen to move on from my ex-boyfriend from high school. In a weird way, he's like a virus; he always comes back around at least once a year. I haven't spoken to Michael since the summer or fall of 2012, so it's been years, but it's crazy to me how every time we rekindle, he's changed more and more, still the same in some ways of course. I know that's what growth is about. Last night he said something like, ""You don't even know who I am anymore,"" and I responded that I don't want to know who he is, so I can get to know this new Michael. I'm happy I have changed as well, because if I hadn't, boy would I be head over heels in love with him. Shit, I already was when his personality sucked!! Unfortunately, I have this weird gift where I can see what people can become, maybe if I work hard enough it could be stronger. Point is, I knew Michael would be the man he is today. Just like I know that Brendan isn't going to be what he has the potential to be. Sorry, I'm bitter. Excuse my angry phase."

"event","i haven't been sad like this in a long, long time. at least with Anthony I knew we weren't working out so when I finally broke up with him, it almost felt liberating. I was angry for awhile, then down in the dumps with Carlos but I don't know. this sad is a different kind of sad. This is a ""I have spent 9 months of everyday with someone and now I'm all alone"" sad. I have my ups and downs day-to-day. Up until today, I'd say I've been doing pretty damn good but when he text me and told me he was calling his sister, and the fact he hasn't talked to his sister in I think years, makes me sad. I'm sad I'm not apart of his life to be there beside him making this step to reconcile. I'm really sad I can't meet her. Or his nephew. It's probably best not to be around for that knowing how awesome he is with kids. I wanted so badly to have kids with him and raise a functional family the best way two dysfunctional people could, because with him I felt I could do anything, WE could do anything. That's how I justified everything in my head, ""If I could stand beside him everyday he was struggling, hating himself and wanting to die, and he could stand beside me whenever I wanted to die, we can make it through anything."" My heart longs for him. I'd do anything to have him back in my life as my partner in crime and as my lover. I pray I don't have to experience this again. I'm just so tired of being left."

"event","Today has been a good day. It didn't start out that way, with me waking up and deciding to quit my second job, but I have confidence I did the right thing, though I still regret it. How is that? How can you regret something you did but feel you made a good decision? I guess it's like accepting you have to let someone go but still wishing they were with you? I don't know. Today has been a little better from yesterday. I know the more time goes on, the easier things will be. I just hope he knows how special he is, not just to me, but to the entire world. He really struggled with self-confidence in the beginning and I hope that he can gain/find it or has. I hope I made him feel loved. I know I probably made him feel sane lol I'm happy he stayed the night with me when we broke up and I'm happy we weren't intimate. He is such a great guy. I guess I should stop day dreaming about him.
I am really happy that I stuck things out with him. I had so many people question our relationship (""Are you sure you want to do this?"") and I had so many people tell me that he favored my mother. I know people doubted us and they doubted his sobriety. We pulled through. Some people might look at it as we didn't since we ultimately have broken up, but to me we did. We spent nine months together; nine long sober months. In the beginning I really didn't know who I was laying in bed next to. The beginning of our relationship was extremely hard and I didn't expect us to be together long. Once I got to know him, I fell hard. Those were the best times of my life. 
I'm real slow in life, as in I am a late bloomer. I feel like most people of my generation are encompassing on their ""forever relationships"" but I'm just getting started on really creating a groundbreaking, confident, loving relationship with myself. I'm scared and I'm very, very vulnerable, but I am so ready. I have confidence that once the time is right, I will encounter another true love. I am very proud of myself for making progression with my intimate relationships. Michael was off and on for four years and well, we have that one person from high school we don't cut off for awhile. Anthony was great. I really lost myself in him and I hate I did that, but he helped me build confidence in myself. He supported me and helped me view things logically. Brendan, well, of course I'm still in love so to me, right now, he's just everything I've ever wanted. I have to say it felt really nice to admire someone from afar for so long and then get what you wanted-them. I had the biggest crush on him for SO long and everyone knew, of my friends at least. I felt honored that he took up interest with me because I knew how considerate he was and how hard it was for him to open up. He has been the most emotionally supportive partner I have ever had, but I will say that he could have communicated much, much more and he even admitted that himself. He just isn't one to like to talk about things. I know at times I felt like he didn't inquire enough in my personal matters. So now that I know how loving warmth feels with also knowing what else I still yearn for, I can seek it out when the time is right; i am in no absolute rush."

This summer has not been the summer I was looking forward to. At this point, I have two months of hot, sticky weather to wear barely any clothes in and run around and get plastered before we&#39;re all trapped indoors and required to layer up, loathing life again. My life, well, my summer, has been taken over by a boy, who is the age of a man but living a boyish life. I have given up my aspirations (no I havent, I just like being extremely exaggerated) to revolve my world around him, just like I would to any boy with tattoos who smiles at me. But this boy in particular I have fancied from afar for over two years. My tarot card reader pointed him out three months ago to be my (at the time) future boyfriend and provide me the emotional support I&#39;ve never received. Oh, has he ever given me emotional support in ways that feel so good to my heart and soul, but at the same time he has turned my world upside down. If you ask him, he hasn&#39;t done anything but his addiction has done it all, and I haven&#39;t been able to decide if it&#39;s his addiction that angers me the most or the feeling I have that he won&#39;t take responsibility of his actions and keeps blaming his addiction. I&#39;ll never know the difference between the two because they are so wrapped up together, his addiction and himself. One thing I do know is through all of this I have realized how damaged i am. I don&#39;t think I realized how hurt I was from things with Anthony and I. I mean how could I not be, I was neglected for almost over two months. I saw myself marrying this man. Then to travel all the way on the other half of the county to see a BOY who had literally nothing to do with me afterwards. After that I come into this, damaged and unawaringly depressed. I will never blame him for my depression, any &quot;him&quot;s, because I realize that I need help and I know, I know, there&#39;s nothing wrong with asking for it. So is that the calm after the storm, the reason for the everything, realizing I need help? Who fucking knows. As the worn out saying goes, &quot;time will tell&quot;. As of now, I&#39;m going to continue loathing his existence and crying everyday until the next piece of shit comes along."

I thought I was okay, though I think I knew I actually wasn&#39;t. Two back-to-back failed attempts with no healing after the major explosion is not going to leave one quite ready for the world. I took him on anyway, because after two years&#39; worth of admiration not only was I curious but I was humbled my dream was finally coming true. I had came home and beat myself up over not being able to tell him liked him and days I would spend thinking about him, again, for two years. So i let him wrap me up in all of his drug infested misery that I had no clue was present. He has wrapped me in such a cocoon that I can&#39;t reach out for help. A lot of me wonders if he was really right all along, all those times he would say &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to hurt you..just being me..this addiction.&quot; I don&#39;t know anything about addictions, is this what it does to people? Does addictions make you use people for whatever piece you feel you&#39;re missing then when they have satisfied it you move on? Well, it feels that way and that&#39;s the only thing I can go on right now. I said some fucked up shit this week, but nothing that prepared me for the rest of this week. Maybe I am just <i>that</i> much of a pushover that I give people trillions of chances when they should have none and he&#39;s more firm in his boundaries, but if he liked me as much as he said he did,he&#39;d understand &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; and we would have transitioned back into how we were already. Instead, he gets a cop out and gets to blame his addiction for making him want to figure out the next steps for himself. What this means in non-i-dont-take-advantage-of-people language is that he doesn&#39;t care to date me anymore.

Is honesty even a real thing anymore, or is it an idea we have of something we wish we could obtain? I realize I&#39;m pretty fucked up and I acknowledge that but minus one person, generally no matter what I try to be completely honest back but I feel like I am constantly being robbed of the only thing I bring to the world, and that&#39;s my feelings; my good nature, counseling, etc."

"event","<p>I found multiple papers decorated in different color markers like the ones I used to make in high school when you were ""going out"" with someone. One had quotes on it talking about the being vulnerable and open to taking the first step of being in a relationship, kind of like an ""I do"". There was one paper where it appeared to be a conversation between two people. I don't know at what point I knew it was Anthony and his new girlfriend's, but I was extremely heated and upset that this was in my hands like it was in front of me on purpose. I read their encounter and how Anthony came up to here. Apparently he did so in November and she's liked him since. He states multiple times how he's not ready to begin another relationship and brings me up multiple times, stating how he feels he needs to be respectful towards me. The girl is pretty much like ""fuck her"" and continues to persuade him. I bring the papers to the dining room and lay it out in front of my sister  to make sure they aren't hers and as it turns out, they aren't. What I was going to do with them next, I'm unsure.</p><p>I have no idea if he's seeing someone else, though it wouldn't surprise me if he is.

Why I ever was concerned to share this with you bothers me.</p><p>I know the last time we spoke, we ended on uneasy terms. I distinctively remember the first time I was up there you told me if we ever broke up, no matter how much you missed me you would never tell me., that you wouldn't be the first to make a move. I don't expect you to be missing me, but I figure id make the first move in clearing the negative energy, even if we never see each other or speak to one another after this.<br>I just wanted to give you consolation in knowing you weren't the only one unhappy in the relationship towards the end. There's many times things didn't feeli right to me and I often wonder if we kept it on longer than it should have been. I wonder if we didn't become so consumed with everything else, would that love still be there? What if we were living by one another? So many questions but the only thing I do know is that when we met, we were exactly what we needed at that time. The love that we felt for one another was very organic and very, very real. But we changed; independently and together. What we needed was no longer the same and I think we denied seeing that for awhile hoping it would just work itself out but I didn't, and that's okay. Just because it didn't work out between us doesn't lessen what we had or felt. I think it was a lesson for both of us to be more self-aware and honest with ourselves and our partner.<br>You helped me remove the people that were toxic in my life that I may not have done otherwise. You motivated me and provided support I never had before. I am thankful for your place in my life, no matter how disappointed I am at how you treated me and us towards the end.<br>If I had power over things, I would never want you to feel as if you are unworthy of being loved and loving one another. Again I don't think the love we shared is not ""real love"", I think we were both able to experience it deeper than previous relations, but just because it didn't last doesn't make it real. All it means is that there is more to learn and apply about ourselves and the relations we encounter. <br>I hope this finds you well and brings some peace with it.</p>"

It makes me jealous because my partner doesn't do that. If I were to confront him about it, I would get told that he's not like that and I knew that going into this. Blah blah blah. It would just feel good every once in a while to be claimed; to have that recognition of ""This is my girlfriend and I love her."" I don't want it all the time, but every once in a while would be nice. It would make me feel more confident about myself, about how attractive I am to you, your feelings for me and all the other selfish reasons you can think of. The reason I ever post selfies is because I want attention from you. I used to stay glued to my phone before we talked to see if you'd like it. I do that now. I want that communication of attraction. To some people, it should just be an unspoken fact of being in a relationship but for me I need to hear/see you tell me these things every once in a while.

When I see pictures of you now, it&#39;s not like I even think to myself, &quot;I miss her,&quot;. So why do you keep appearing? Both of you. One of you made me feel so inadequate, and the other..I guess we really did have good times together. Maybe I miss that feeling, of having people around me. The people that surround me now and true jewels and my most prized possessions, but I guess you both will always have a special place in my heart, though we ended unhappily. And maybe I don&#39;t recognize how much I really <i>do</i> think of you both, but quickly stuff the thoughts down the drain. There&#39;s a part of me that longs to be your friend again, but my pride is too big to pick up the phone. I don&#39;t even have either of your numbers to ask how you are. I haven&#39;t had those for years. I can be so critical of others, so stubborn, but so hesitant to make a move. 

The full moon is in Pisces, and I have to listen to my emotions. I need to align myself with how I feel and recognize that changes need to be made. I will never reach out to you, but I will continue to always think of you. I do not believe that either one of you will ever fully understand how much you meant to me.</p>"

"event","Training today robbed me emotionally. 

Through the organization, I have received so much praise for my experience, trained knowledge, and commitment to the field of suicide prevention. From receiving these comments, it has helped give me confidence in reassuring this is the direction I want to take my life; this is what I want to do. I can do it.

After thorough discussion of grief, we were presented with a couple who had lost their due to suicide. Slowly but surely, every memory of Kasey was brought to the surface and multiple times I kept having to tell myself, ""Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry,"". Inside, I was right with these people since I was once there before; experiencing the loss of a loved one. On the outside, I did not want to let that show. We let out for lunch afterwards and I was so frustrated with myself. 
Why can't I still hold it together at times? Why am I still able to get so emotional over my loss?

When I returned to the organization from break, I was approached by a worker who informed me I was chosen as a candidate to help create the Attempters of Suicide support group. I found out later how the organization is creating the foundation for a text-base crisis hotline-something I am very developed in. After all this, I made a realization. 

It's people like me that are needed within the field of suicide prevention, but it's not me they really need. The field, the victims, and the people in crisis need my empathy, my ability to be present, and my honesty. I looked back at what triggered my eyes to become watery and my throat to choke, and it wasn't even the same things I used to get upset over. My feelings also didn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth like before, where I would be so sad and it would carry on for a couple of days, sometimes a week. Most importantly I realized that it's okay to be in the moment with how you feel, because you're not the only one that's feeling that way. 

I have made a lot of progression within my grief but I recognize this is a very long journey. No matter what, he will always be apart of me."

i spotted him as soon as he walked up to the bar. 
i kept an eye on him all night, trying to see who he came with, wondering if there was a girl around that might claim him as her's.
one of my friends went up to him and started talking to him.
a ticket, a pass to introduce myself.
time went by and i shrugged it off until we were on the floor in front of the stage, waiting for the band to come on, when i looked over to my right and there he was, standing in all his beautiful glory.
he was talking to a couple people around him, while glancing at me at the same time.
was i making it obvious i couldn't take my eyes off of him?
i asked another friend if he knew him, and he shook his head no as he said,
""i think his name is Colby""
i looked back over to my right and made my way over, and introduced myself. His name was in fact Colby, and he had driven up by himself from Huntsville, Alabama just to catch this show. He was a huge fan of reggae music, and said he tried to catch it anytime he could. I told him about a local reggae band called ROAR, then told him about the free show coming up of The Wailers. I asked how he knew my friends and he said he didn't-it was just a dread connection that united them. We stopped talking as the band came on. I kept my eyes on him all night...i don't know why. There was something about him I couldn't resist. I saw he ended up in the back of the crowd, so I pulled him to the front and his arms were so muscular. I was melting. As ""Bowl For Two"" came on he lit up a joint and passed it to my friends, then he got kicked out. I followed him out, and even tried to claim the joint, and sat outside with him. I missed the hint when he asked me for my number, because I was determined to get him back in. All my friends came outside, and we snuck him back in. The next band came on, and we all were having a great time. I went to go get us drinks, and ran into the lead singer of the first band. Colby came up and met me at the bar as I introduced the two. We went back into the crowd as ""Falling"" came on, and he wrapped his huge arms around me and we danced the song away, as he held me really tight and thanked me for everything. I felt so lucky. I had the most beautiful guy in the room to myself. We all left and went back over to my friend's place, as they continued to drink and smoke. Next morning I took him back to his hotel in Nashville. I physically got out of the car to give us a little privacy so I could build up confidence to give him my number, since intoxication and determination deferred it the first time.  My throat got so tight as he opened his arms up to give me a hug, and all I could do was just hug him back and smile as he walked away. Literally, the one that got away."

Wait for the guy who pursues you, who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're the prettiest when you have no make-up on and insists on holding you around the waist. The one who is by your side when you are sick, who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you. The one who turns to his friends and says, ""thats her."""

"event","Yesterday was pretty uneventful until I got a phone call for a second interview with Farmington schools!  This time, she video taped my interview but she messed it up and we had to record the whole interview twice!  Overall, I left there with a very good feeling!  I'm not so sure that I will be working at this residental placement but she assured me that there were many openings in Farmington that I would be eligible for!  I was very satisfied when I left and hope to hear back this week or next week!  After my interview, I went home for dinner and then back up to Ypsi for one last night of fun with everyone!  It definitely was a great night to say the least!  We watched ""Napolean Dynamite"" and it was a funny movie!  Now I know where Aaron got all of his quotes! :-p  After that, we decided to take lots of pictures!  When we wound down a little, we broke out some chocolate frosting and had a lot of random fun!  Who knew you could play spin the bottle and lick frosting off their forehead instead!? :-p  It proved to be quite entertaining!  Before long, people had to start leaving and I had to say goodbyes again.  Then there were 5 of us listening to music, checking out online photo albums, and talking.  It was nice and relaxing!  Before long, it was just 3 of us and we ended up going to bed.  This morning Jen T. made us pancakes.  Then we were slow in getting moving but eventually I had to leave and came home.  I didn't do anything exciting...worked on job applications and chatted online.  We ate dinner practically at bed time but still had time to watch a little TV (mainly Blind Justice).  Now I'm pretty sleepy so will clear off my be and hopefully go to bed soon! :-p

I miss you all already!  It's just not the same being so far away from all of you!"

"event","It's been a while since I've updated.  Initially it was because my days were pretty boring being sick.  I did sub all day on Monday but it was with my kids who knew me so it was okay that I didn't really have a voice! :-p  Jen also re-highlighted my hair and it ended up being crazy but it's done and I like it!  It's more blonde and doesn't really look highlighted when it's all down -- it looks like it's died but when I put it up, it's more blonde!  Anyway, I love it and appreciate Jen taking the time to do it! :)  

By Tuesday, I didn't have much of any voice!  I spent the day home not doing much of anything but coughing!  Wednesday was more of the same and I did prepare for my interview with Farmington for a little while.  

Thursday, I was feeling a little better and had a little bit of a voice so I spent time getting myself ready for my interview.  I went out there (with a minor delay in there :-p) and was interviewed by 4 different people.  They asked me a series of questions and took notes while I spoke.  I think it went pretty good actually so I spent the rest of the week anxiously awaiting a possible phone call to come back.  (I'll get there in a minute!)  After the interview, I stopped by home and met Mom and Kelly at Kohl's.  My mom bought me a really nice earrings and necklace set for graduation and they're really pretty! :)  Then we went out to Big Boy for dinner and I came back up to school.  

Friday I spent a lot of time packing up my stuff.  I got a lot of stuff together and filled my car until it was packed and couldn't fit anything else!  Then I took a load home and dropped it off in the garage.  I visited with Mom and Kelly for a little while and came back up to school.  On the way home, I talked to Matt a while and it was really nice to catch up with him!  When I got home, I sat and talked with Jill, Katie, and Brent.  Then I cleaned up and went over to Dustin's for his birthday celebration.  We met up with his friends at Pub 13 and it was a blast!  I had so much fun with him and his friends!  I really would love to do something like that for my birthday!  If anyone is interested in doing something like that around my birthday, let me know!  I would love to organize something if people would like to come!

After a late night, I had to get up early on Saturday to shower and pack before graduating.  It sucked that I didn't get to graduate at the same ceremony as all of my friends but it was  a good feeling to graduate!  I really enjoyed our speaker and it feels great to be officially done with Eastern!  I so couldn't believe that it was snowing though!  It was incredibly cold and a nasty mix of rain/sleet/snow!  We came home to hang out for a while and I talked to my grandparents for a little bit.  Mom had a really bad headache and I felt bad for her so we changed our dinner plans.  The four of us (including Brad, Dad, and Kelly) went to Max and Erma's for dinner instead and we'll do my nice graduation dinner sometime in the near future when everyone can go.  We got to have Matt wait on us and it was nice to spend more time with Brad and Dad (and of course Kelly!).  Shortly after dinner, I came back up to school.  My aunt called me while I was in the midst of getting ready for the party at Kara, Jen and Jens.  I managed to get there and was surprised with a huge bag of books for my classroom from Katie, Jill, Kara, Jen, and Dave!  You guys are the greatest!!!  Thank you so much! :-D  Then the party got started and it was a blast!  I had fun hanging out with friends again and there was a lot of laughing and talking and good memories! :)

This morning was too early as well after being out so late!  I got up and tried to clear out my room.  I thought 4 hours was enough but it took me just that long to get the stuff out into the living room and in boxes.  I spent the next hour cleaning a little and packing my car full again.  It really sucked having to make a million trips to my car in the SNOW!!  It was definitely a first having to 1) move out by myself (almost totally), and 2) in the snow!  I managed to pack my car until it was about to burst.  I officially checked out today and it was sad! :(  My Dad came up to help me fit the last few things into his car and then I was officially moved out of D302a forever.  I had to say goodbyes today and naturally, there were a few tears shed but I am really hoping to keep in touch and possibly see people more since I'll have a car (at some point!). :-p  I am really going to miss being around everyone but luckily we have phones and AIM to keep in touch with!  Now I'm home and it just feels so different.  I know I won't be staying too long so that's a nice feeling.  Thanks to everyone who has made the last few days so great!"

"event","Well, this afternoon consisted of me sitting on the computer updating and submitting online job applications and coughing my head off! :-p  I showered and made dinner.  During that time, I got a phone call for Farmington for a job interview on Thursday!!!  It will be my first offical job interview and I'm not totally certain if it's for a certain position or not but needless to day, I'm very excited about it!  So, since no one was home, I called my house and talked to my parents using what little bit is left of my voice!  It was a fun conversation and I felt better after talking to them!  Then I left just in time to go to Jen's choir concert!  She did a great job! whoo whoo! :-P  I tried to only cough when we were all clapping! :-p  It was fun times for sure!  When I got home, I continued to cough, update online applications, watched some tv and talked online some.  I just wanted to update with my job interview news and now I need to get to bed so that I can wake up in preparation for subbing with my kids all day tomorrow! :)  It could be entertaining without a voice! :-p  g'night!"

"event","Friday afternoon I got to see my kids again which was great!  I missed them and I had their class gift so I went in to see them and give it to them!  It was nice to see them and spend some time with them. :)  When I came home, if I recall correctly I worked on balancing my checkbooks.  Surprisingly, it went very smoothly! :-p  I went out to Bubble Island then with Kara, Jen T., Jay, and Sam which was nice to get out and I have been craving bubble island! :-p  

Yesterday was productive which I was happy about.  As much as I don't want to think about moving out, I need to so I spent a good deal of time packing yesterday.  I think I've got about six boxes ready to go!  After that I actually got to read for fun (for a few minutes :-p) while waiting for plans to be made!  Jen ended up coming over for dinner and we ended up going to Bubble Island again eventually! :-p  We went with Jill and met Kara, Jen and Jay there.  We couldn't stay too long though cuz Jen and I came back here to see the No U-Turn a cappella concert.  My friend Julius is a recent addition to the group so I went to support him! :)  They did a good job and so did the other two groups that were there. :)  After the concert, I went to Jen's while she got ready.  Katie and I left at one point to come home and change and then went back.  We (meaning Jen, Katie, and Jenny) went to Ricks in Ann Arbor.  I enjoyed it and it was fun to be out with the girls and to do some dancing with them!  It was a nice girls' night! :) 

Today I'm hoping to go to a BBQ shortly and then Jen's choir concert! 

Only 5 days, 23 hours, and 22 min until graduation! :)"

"event","Well this week ended up being super busy!  Wednesday I didn't end up taking any jobs so that I could spend the day preparing for the job fair.  I didn't anticipate it taking so long to prepare but I got myself as organized as I could get.  I took a long lunch break to talk with Katie and it was a nice chat!  Thanks girly! :)  After a nice dinner, I went out to run some errands like making copies of my resume and picking up my pics.  I also stopped and got a new contract for my cell and got a new phone.  I really like my new phone and it's been fun playing with lately!  We had our last night of bowling too and I didn't do half bad!  I got a couple of strikes which was great and our team beat the team we played against who turned out to not be as talkative either! :-p 

Yesterday was the longest day of my life...or so it felt.  I went to the Teacher Job Fair.  My friend picked me up at 9 and we were there and waiting in lines by 9:30.  I ended up seeing 7 out of my 9 school districts that I wanted to see.  I went to Ann Arbor, Novi, Wayne-Westland, Rochester, Howell, Farmington, and Lincoln-Consolidated.  I stood in line for so long and was actually tired and sore but I'm hoping that it will pay off in the long run.  So, after this really  long day, I came home and basically crashed.  I didn't do much productive but I did try to relax.  My evening did end up on a good note. :)

This morning I was rudely awoken by the stupid fire alarm.  I wasn't feeling well because I think my allergies were acting up so I was not a happy camper to have to get some more clothes on and to go outside.  Afterwards, I figured that I was up and might as well be productive.  So I ended up showering and then cleaning up my room.  It's a little more organized now.  After lunch, I went to the Ann Arbor Human Resource department and turned in my fingerprints againg.  Then I stopped by the classroom to take Karen my gift and to spend some time with the kids again.  It was nice to spend some time with them!  Now I'm just procrastinating and trying to decide what to do this evening!  Any ideas, let me know! :-p"

"event","Today was much busier than yesterday!  I got up and got myself ready for my awards thing before going to work.  I actually took the time to curl my hair which was interesting now that it's getting so long!  I got to work with my kids again this afternoon which was awesome!!  I am going to miss them the next two days but I may go back to visit them just for the heck of it!  Right after work, I went to an Honors Commencement Reception.  We spent the first hour sitting around talking and the actual ""ceremony"" part was getting my gold medallion and a diploma-like certificate showing that I graduate with honors in General Ed.  It was nice to have my Mom there with me!  After that, we all went to the President's house for a reception and got a little tour and enjoyed talking to my mom and friends.  We didn't stay for long and went home to spend dinner with Kelly...of course was at my all-time favorite restaurant!  After a fun and nice dinner together with a hot waiter, I came back up to school.  I ended up going to spend some time with Jen and Jen for a little bit.  We started watching ""Alfie"" and it ended up being awful!  We put in ""Taxi"" and the Jen's began to fell asleep so I left and came back here.  I've just been cleaning and chatting online.  

I am really weirded out by the recent fact that people can type in my screenname in google and find out personal info about my friends and that makes me nervous.  I'm not sure what to do about it...


These two songs are my new songs that I have really connected with lately!  check it out!

MAROON 5 LYRICS

""Through With You""

Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you
Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you

And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two do you?

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you""


KELLY CLARKSON LYRICS

""Gone""

What you see's not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there
Your eyes they sparkle
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

Sometimes shattered
Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you
Always ending
Always over
Back and forth, up and down like a rollercoaster
I am breaking
That habit
Today

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

There is nothing you can say
Sorry doesn't cut it, babe
Take the hint and walk away
'Cause I'm gone
Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone

What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Oh, I'm already gone, gone, gone, gone
Already gone
I'm gone"

Sunday I went home for a little while and spent time with my Mom and Kelly!  It was great to see them for a little while!  Then after dinner, I came back and went to Dustin's to hang out with him and Randall for a while.  It was great to see them both for a while and to hang out!

Today was my first official day of subbing!  I got to go back to my classroom that I just left on Friday and surprise my kids!  It was great!  It was such a nice feeling to be in there and be getting paid for it!  I get to go back tomorrow afternoon again which will be great!  I've also been working on my job search prep so I'm ready for the job search on Thursday which I'm hoping will help!  Now, I hope to get ready for bed soon cuz I'm tired! :-p"

"event","As evident by the lack of recent updates, I have been really busy this week!  It was my last week of student teaching so I had a lot going on!  I spent time a lot more time than usual with Jen and Kara and Jen which was great!  It's nice to know that in times of difficulty I still can always rely on my girls (including my roomies, mom, and sister) to help pick me up!  We did a Bubble Island run one night and a Dairy Queen run another night and it was great to get out and have some fun with the girls when things get stressful! :)  Thanks girls!!

Student teaching was kinda hectic for being the final week.  On Monday I had my final observation and it was such a joke.  I guess that I should be happy about that but I have to say that I am genuinely disappointed that I never really had a good observation all semester!  I had a bunch of loose ends to tie up this week and finish lesson plans/unit stuff/observations/mock IEP to complete this week so it was a lot of littler things to get done but they were nonetheless time-consuming.  I got my final evals and my teacher had so many nice things to say about my teaching and interactions with the kids and it made me happy!  She also told me that none of the kids have ever said anything negative about me which I am shocked by but also pleased to know!  My university supervisor is such an idiot!  She hasn't observerd me for much of anything as far as my teaching the whole group and gave me okay ratings.  Then she saw my teachers ratings as mostly excellent and changed all of hers!  She just needs to retire! :-p

On Tuesday, I had my substitue teacher orientation for Ann Arbor and I'm very excited about that!  As of Monday, I can start subbing for Ann Arbor and actually get paid for the first time all year! :)  It was a pretty boring meeting but I left quite excited about it and ready to sub! :-D  yay!  I went home Tuesday for dinner and ended up getting to keep my car up here until I graudate to make subbing opportunites easier!  I'm very grateful for that because then I can actually go to other schools easier! 

Wednesday we had bowling and it was crazy!  We were all pretty hyper and being goofy but it was definitely fun!  I had my best round ever my second round and we all were at or above 100 that round too!  I bowled a 114 that time and was quite excited!  I know that's still pretty sucky for a ""good"" bowler but I was happy for my new record! :-p  We were all just unstopable I guess! :-p  The team we played against was pretty quiet for the most part which wasn't too fun but one of the guys was fun and talked to us a little or gave us high-fives!  We have decided that we are prolly one of the only teams with so much team spirit...we always give eachc other a high-five after every frame no matter how bad it sucked or if we didn't knock down any pins! :-p  It's great and make it more fun! :) 

Today was a bittersweet kind of day...it was my last day of student teaching and my last day of required undergrad attendance until graduation (yay!) but I also had to say goodbye to my kids (boo!).  They had a party for me complete with a cake and everything!  The kids made me a card and all wrote me a message inside.  Keddy (my favorite kid) made me a separate card which was sweet!  Karen also got me a Tappan t-shirt to remember them all by but how could I ever forget them!  I made my pretzle dippers for them and the inhaled the whole batch! :-p  I also got pictures with them and of them to help remember some of them by.  They all told me things that they would miss about me but I told them that I will be back to visit and hopefully sub!  I didn't cry (although there were a few times I almost did!) and did get to give Lawrence and Keddy hugs.  The thought of not going back everday makes me sad and miss them already but I do look forward to finally being able to get paid for my work! :-p  I hope to keep in touch with at least Keddy online. 

After school, I picked up a skirt that I may wear for graduation so that was exciting! :)  I also talked to my Dad who is in Arizona for my cousin's wedding tomorrow!  I also stopped in Old Navy and got a few things to celebrate spring! :-p  Since then, things have been pretty dull.  I cleaned up my trashed room (somewhat) and did some laundry while watching TV.  Now, I guess since no one is really around, I'm just gonna go to bed and get some sleep! :)  G'night! :)"

After lunch, I ran some errands -- the main one being fingerprinted for my job applications.  I'm glad that I finally got that out of the way!  Then, I stopped in Maurice's and love that store!  I found so many things that I wanted to buy but couldn't afford it all!  Then I stopped at Target to get some cute cards before stopping home.  Then Mom, Kelly and I went out to Westland Mall and I had some good luck at JC Penney! :)  I found a cute shirt and two tops!  I have to decide what I can afford and wait for the rest for my birthday.  I wanted something new to wear for raduation and/or this honors graduation thing I have coming up.  Oh and there's the thing at the President's house too!  I love when I have good days shopping! :-p  After shopping we had dinner at Max and Erma's and I saw Matt there! :)  I got to see him twice in one week and we swapped student teaching stories.  After a great dinner, we relaxed and watched ""The Incredibles"".  It turned out to be a really cute movie!  After that everyone went to bed so I finished my taxes (well all that I can on my own) and graded my tests from my unit.  I was disappointed in the results but have just decided to get over it.  Then I spent some time working on a special project and chatting online.  Now I'm really tired and should get to bed soon.  g'night."

"event","Things have been kinda hectic the last 48 hours but they've definitely almost stopped since!  I went up to school Tuesday night and hung out for a little bit.  Wednesday was my day of trying to take care of a million things!  I spent the morning at the Ann Arbor Human Resources office filling out the official paper work to be a sub so I'm really excited that this is all working out so nicely!  Then I stopped and got new jeans, washed my car, got my cap and gown, and hung out with friends for a while!  I met Dustin for lunch before going to my last small group seminar which was pretty inspirational.  After class, I ended up hanging out with the girls which was great!  I came home to watch ""lost"" and then went bowling.  It was wierd cuz my first round was worse than I could have ever imagine!  However, by the final round I was up to 92 so I was fine!  We are #20 in the league and played the #1 team! :-p  We ended up having a lot of fun and went out to Pub 13 for a little bit afterwards with them. I was hyper after that and watched a movie and went to bed late! ;) 

Today I came home way too early ;) and stopped by the pool and talked to one of my bosses!  I'm really looking forward to working there again!  I found out that I may have a chance of being manager now since my brother applied for two other internships!  Well see.  Then after having lunch, I got all dressed up.  I came back to campus for an Honors Award ceremony.  I didn't really know what it was but came to find out that each area of education sat down and picked out ""excellent"" students to represent the department.  I was one chosen for the Special Ed - EI group.  There were only about 8 special ed people so that was exciting! :)  It turned out to be short so we visited with my advisor and friend for a little before heading home.  When  I got home, we didn't do much...had dinner and watched our shows.  After that, I've spent the rest of the night thinking, talking, working on a lesson, and doing more thinking...so on that note, I'm gonna try to get some sleep tonight..."

""Behind These Hazel Eyes""
Kelly Clarkson

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore...

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

"event","Today was pretty uneventful.  Somehow I slept until 1 and was out cold for the night.  I guess I was more tired that I thought so I haven't really been awake all that long.  When I finally got my butt out of bed, I got a shower and then got to work and pretty much spent the entire day filling out job applications.  Some of them are very close to being sent out.  I just need to try to upload a document or something.  I'm excited that they are getting done finally!  It's just annoying how long some of them take!  I think I only got like 3 or 4 mostly done today because they take so long to do! grr!  Anyway, after dinner I watched tv with the family and when they all went to bed by 10, I came up here and worked on job applications more! :-p  And now I think I'm gonna go to bed so I don't sleep all day tomorrow again!!  *Things have been kinda strange between us lately but I just want you to know how much I care and want things to work out for the best.*  I found a fun quote to end with: ""If you get caught looking at him... at least you know he was looking back."" g'night"

"event","Today ended up being a nice day with the family!  We got up and went to our old (favorite) pastor's new church to see him.  We spent 15 years with him and really needed a does of comfort from him so it was weird to not be at our church but the best feeling was to see how happy he was to see us! :)  We even got to talk to him for a little while after church which made my day!  After church, Brad and I made this kick-ass breakfast/lunch at like 1:30! :-p  It was nice to all be together!  We spent the day relaxing and Kelly and I played a lot of board/card games together.  On and off, we watched Wisconsin lose and then while Mom and I got our nice dinner ready, we watched the State game.  It carried through our nice dinner and the double OT was so intense!  It was down to the last minute or less when State pulled through with another amazing upset!  After an all day basketball watching marathon, the girls voted to watch ""Save the Last Dance"" and it stirred up a lot of emotions within me tonight...on several different levels.  That movie is now on my ""must get"" list! :-p  I had some hot chocolate with Mom afterwards cuz I was frozen! :-p  It was nice to sit and talk with her about a lot of stuff today.  I think I've sorted out some major things and can verbalize them and she is one that has always been there for me.  I wish that I could say I feel all better now but things keep coming up that continue to make me think and I'm just tired of thinking.  I've been able to reach some conclusions with that I am very happy/proud of and other situations have left me feeling great/amazing one moment and totally lost and confused the next.  I guess time will tell.  My favorite quote basically can sum up part of my feelings: ""a guy and a girl can be just friends but at one point, one will fall for the other, maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe, just maybe forever..."""

"event","Well the rest of today has gone well.  I did some work on my job applications and am trying to finish them up as soon as possible and fill in the missing parts.  I took a break this afternoon and went to run a few errands with Mom and Kelly.  When we got home, Kelly and I did our nails togther which was fun.  We relaxed afterwards together (with Ewe and Mimi too:-p) and then got ready to go out.  We went to say goodbye to Justin tonight.  It was so great to see him!  I haven't seen him in forever and he hasn't changed at all!  He's leaving to go to boot camp on Wednesday and eventually go on in hopes of becoming a Ranger.  I've been told it will take 36 weeks to complete his training and this is something he really wants to do so I'm happy for him and hope that it ends up being what he hopes it is!  I'm going to be really worried about him though and hope that he doesn't end up going to Iraq.  I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to him!  Nonetheless, it was great to see him again!  I've really missed him!  After seeing him and the family, we all went out to Steak 'n' Ale for a nice steak dinner!  Of course I had my favorite chocolate cake for dessert! :-p  When I got home (super stuffed), Brad and I went back to try to say goodbye to Justin again (since Brad didn't get to) but we had just missed him.  Maybe we'll be able to see him tomorrow.  After we got home, everyone pretty much did their own thing so I decided to work on job applications more.  I talked online a little but spent a lot of time filling out this long questionairre.  It was only like 12 questions but it took me about an hour to finish it because they involved mini-paragraph answers.  Some were like what would you do in this situation or what do you think about this advice?  Anyway, I'm tired of thinking now and just hope that it sounds good enough to get a job!  So, on that note, Happy Easter and g'night :)"

"event","Well, it has been pretty busy lately this week (hence the lack of updates) but I hoping things are a little less crazy from here on.  This week (Monday thru Thursday) I still was going solo and was very busy!  I had to finish my unit and deal with a lot of major behavior issues this week.  I hadn't really had to deal with as much behavior as this week and it was pretty overwhelming.  After Monday and Tuesday, I came with headaches cuz of the intense stress.  It wasn't fun and I didn't really get to talk to anyone about it so I ended up calling my  mom to vent.  I just got frustrated because I want to be able to solve problems well and I have to get over the fact that I won't always be able to solve every problem that comes my way but to learn how to effectively deal with it.  I guess it was my first major conflict I had to deal with and I don't think that I ever expected it to be quite so frustrating.  This week definitely gave me a much better feel of what it will be like and it's more accurate. 

Needless to say I was really looking forward to bowling on Wednesday night after staying after school for a staff meeting.  I did  better this week than I did last week but still really need to just practice more.  So, if anyone is up for going to play anytime, let me know cuz I'd love to go practice!  

Thursday was more relaxing and a better way to end the week!  After school, it was so beautiful outside that I opened my window!  I watched some of my taped shows and decided to start packing.  I figured that I needed to start packing up some boxes of stuff to take home for good.  I ended up with four full boxes and several bags of stuff that I now have at home.  It felt good to have stuff to take home but it's also sad to think that I have to start getting ready to move home and I'm really gonna miss being around everyone! :( *tears*  Anyway, it took me a while that night to get things done.  Eventually, Brian and I met up with some people at Theo's.  I had never been there before and it was different than I expected but it was fun nonetheless to get out and have some fun after a crazy week! :)  Oh!  I also found out on Thursday that I can apply to be a sub for Ann Arbor schools!  Next week I'll have to go to the HR office and fill out paperwork so that I can attend an orientation meeting the following Tuesday!  I'm so excited! :-D 

Friday I slept in and finished packing up.  I ended up coming home around 2ish and then my dad took me to meet Mom and Kelly at Westland Mall to do some shopping for the rest of the day!  It was fun for sure!  We stopped home after that mall for a little rest and then headed out to Laurel Park.  I found out that Kelly got asked to Prom!  It was fun to go prom dress shopping with her...a little strange just to think that she's growing up so fast but definitely fun at the same time! :)  We shopped until the mall closed and then stopped at Max and Erma's for some fish.  I got the chance to finally talk to my mom about some of the more major personal issues/conflicts I've been dealing with lately and haven't been able to talk about with anyone really.  I felt better about it after we could talk and I could finally do it without getting too emotional (other than raising my voice a few times :-p).  While we were at Marshall Field's she bought me the most adorable stuffed sheep holding a baby sheep.  We decided to name the mom Ewe (pronounced like ""you"") and the baby Mimi (like ""me)! :-p  We've had so many laughs over the silly sheep the last 12 hours that I've had it though and it's been great!  I miss shopping with my mom because she can be so goofy and make it such a fun trip! (ie having the shirts direct us out of the store!) :-p  Anyway, after dinner, we relaxed and ended up watching basketball with Dad and Brad for a little while and eventually they went to bed.  I was exhausted but chatted some online but then went to bed. 

It felt great to sleep in but I woke up with a headache so I showered and got cleaned up and now I feel better.  I'm gonna try to go be productive for a little while and then go out to a fancy dinner with at least my parents and Kelly (who knows if Brad will be around).  It's nice to be home with the family.  I just wish that sometimes I could have both worlds together and have my friends around too.  I'm gonna take adavantage of the time I've got when I get back though!  Now I'm gonna go try to be productive! :)"

"event","well, things have been pretty low-key this weekend.  I went home on Friday after school which was nice!  Things were pretty low-key cuz we were all tired.  My mom made Fratata which I haven't had in forever and it was great!  I also got some to bring back home too! :-p  It was nice to just sit around and talk and relax together.  I went to bed before 11 and it was nice to get some sleep!  I was out all night and it felt good to catch up on some sleep.  I am hoping to get to bed earlier this week so I'm not so overly tired.  Having Friday off will help too! :-p  Saturday morning, I had my final dentist appointment to put on my crown.  I'm very glad that it's taken care of!  Today it's been rubbing on my cheek a lot and I'm hoping that goes away but we'll see.  During the afternoon, I chatted for a while and helped Kelly with spanish.  The best part of my day was getting ready for church with Kelly!  It was so much fun standing in the bathroom together doing our hair and make up and just talking girl talk together!  We have never really done that before and it was really a special time for me that I really will cherish!  We went to church and then to Max and Erma's with Bailey's and it was great to see them again!  It was definitely fun to see them again and to all have dinner together!  After dinner, I got my stuff together and Dad and Kelly brought me back up here.  I talked to Jill for a while when I got back which was nice and then Jen and I debated for most of the night what to do!  We ended up just hanging out here! :-p  Today was boring...I did laundry which was good to get done and then worked on lessons and planning.  It was a long and boring day so I'm glad that it's just about done.  I'm gonna get to bed early hopefully in preparation for a busy week again.

I miss what we used to have and am sorry that things between us have changed..."

"event","Wow!  Things have been insanely busy lately and I feel like I have no time to do much of anything any more.  I am still teaching solo so that made this week really intense and filled mostly with planning lessons. Tuesday, I waited with my favorite kid for at least 2 hours after school until his dad got there (since he missed the bus) and then just worked on lessons that night.  Wednesday night I went bowling with Jen, Jen T., and Emily and that was fun!  I haven't bowled much in my life and pretty much suck but it turned out to be amusing and fun! It was a late night though but worth it!  Thursday night consisted of guess what?  More lesson plans! :-p  It's getting annoying to have to spend so much time doing them and it will be nice when next week is done!  Last night I came home for the night and it was nice to see the family again!  We were all kinda tired though and I ended up going to bed by 11!  It seemed strange but I was out all night...having some weird dreams but got a lot of sleep.  My life hasn't been very exciting in that sense.  I have had a lot of random things to think about lately that have been really weighing on my mind and I'm struggling with how to deal with certain issues or situations.  Times are changing and I don't know that it's right to blame it all on PMS but something feels differently.  I've spent a lot of time listening to music instead lately and some songs just stick out in my mind and make me think of certain people or situations...

Why Can't I? Lyrics
by Liz Phair

Get a load of me, get a load of you
Walkin' down the street, and I hardly know you
It's just like we were meant to be

Holding hands with you, and we're out at night
Got a girlfriend, you say it isn't right
And I've got someone waiting too

This is, this is just the beginning
We're already wet, and we're gonna go swimming

Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak whenever I talk about you
It's inevitable, it's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

Isn't this the best part of breakin' up
Finding someone else you can't get enough of
Someone who wants to be with you too

*****************************************
(when I am around you, I feel like this...)

Naked
Avril Lavigne

I wake up in the morning
Put on my face
The one that's gonna get me
Through another day
Doesn't really matter
How I feel inside
'Cause life is like a game sometimes

But then you came around me
The walls just disappeared
Nothing to surround me
And keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected
See how I've opened up
Oh, you've made me trust

Because I've never felt like this before
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you
And it feels so right

I'm tyring to remember
Why I was afraid
To be myself and let the
Covers fall away
I guess I never had someone like you
To help me, to help me fit
In my skin

I never felt like this before
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you
And it feels so right

I'm naked
Oh oh yeah
Does it show?
Yeah, I'm naked
Oh oh, yeah yeah

I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide

******************************************
Because of You
by Kelly Clarkson


I will not make the same mistakes that you did 
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery 
I will not break the way you did 
You fell so hard 
I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far 

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk 
Because of you 
I learned to play on the safe side
So I don't get hurt 
Because of you 
I find it hard to trust 
Not only me, but everyone around me 
Because of you 
I am afraid 

I lose my way 
And it's not too long before you point it out 
I cannot cry 
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes 
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
Every day of my life 
My heart can't possibly break 
When it wasn't even whole to start with 

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk 
Because of you 
I learned to play on the safe side 
So I don't get hurt 
Because of you 
I find it hard to trust 
Not only me, but everyone around me 
Because of you 
I am afraid 

I watched you die 
I heard you cry
Every night in your sleep 
I was so young 
You should have known better than to lean on me 
You never thought of anyone else 
You just saw your pain 
And now I cry 
In the middle of the night 
For the same damn thing

Because of you 
I never stray too far from the sidewalk 
Because of you 
I learned to play on the safe side 
So I don't get hurt 
Because of you 
I tried my hardest just to forget everything 
Because of you 
I don't know how to let anyone else in 
Because of you 
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty 
Because of you 
I am afraid 

Because of you
Because of you"

The kids seemed somewhat off today which I'm sure what partially because the teacher was absent.  My lessons went alright I guess...nothing special.  After school, I tried to meet with my advisor to get some suggestions but got stood up once again so I was irritated.  I finished taking care of my stuff to graduate with Honors which feels good to be done with that!  When I got home, I pretty much got right to work on my science lesson for tomorrow and spent long into this evening working on it.  I prolly finished it about 2 hours ago and it took much longer than planned.  I finished up some language arts lessons for tomorrow and Wednesday (at least I think so) and now am feeling somewhat grumpy so I'm gonna get my stuff organized and just go to bed.  Hopefully I will wake up in a better mood tomorrow.  g'night."

"event","Well I've been pretty busy lately which explains why I haven't updated as much recently.  I finished creating my unit but still am modifying it daily and then again after I actually teach it.  I've still be stressing/thinking about a lot of stuff during the week which was cause for many headaches and unrest.  

Thursday I started my solo weeks and taught my first lesson of my unit as well as taking over everything.  It went pretty well overall.  Friday was more intense and I ended up being exhausted and fighting a headache by the end of the day.  I spent the rest of the night playing around with my website and am now excited about working on it more.  I've gotten some great ideas of what to do with it.  I will re-publicize it when I get all of my modifications done so that everyone can see my work of art and give me more feedback!

Yesterday was a little productive but not as much as I would have liked. :-p  I ended up hanging out and having fun more than I probably should have, but it was nice to not be stressing about stuff.  Jen ended up cooking dinner for me and it was good!  It was nice to eat dinner together!  Kelly also called me at one point and it was great to hear from her even if it was for just a short while!  After that, we just hung out with Kara and Dave and had fun just being silly! :-p  Finally, Jen and I got ready to go out!  I have been waiting to go out forever!  We decided to go to Divine and I am so glad that we did!  Brian met up with us and the three of us had a good time!  After fun times dancing, I just hung out for a while.

Today I have been very productive so far.  I have planned out all of my lessons for the week for the most part and decided at least decided what I am going to teach.  I still need to work on my science lessons a little more and test out my experiement for tomorrow.  I may spend some time on my website now.  That's about it for now."

"event","The last 36-ish hours have been pretty intense and somewhat emotional for me.  Yesterday was a pretty lazy day but I did accomplish more job searching and printing off job applications.  I also talked to Mohamad on the phone for a really long time to try to sort out stuff/emotions.  It ended up being an emotionally draining talk and I still feel bad but need to honest about my thoughts and feelings.  I feel a little better that I was able to verbalize my feelings which has never been easy for me.  Needless to say, I wasn't in the best mood the rest of yesterday.

Today, my teacher was absent so I got another solo day.  It went pretty well for the most part.  I got frustrated last hour becuase I just don't understand my kids sometimes.  Basically the lesson didn't go at all like I had planned but I guess I'll get over it.  So, I came home stewing about a lot of stuff and pretty uneasy.  I spent the afternoon doing nothing too productive and now I found out that I have to go to this all-day workshop tomorrow that I had hoped I didn't have to go to.  My teacher called me this afternoon and bascially told me I had to go so I have to go to Pioneer High School for the morning session and then go to my school for the afternoon.  Tomorrow is going to be a busy and long day I think but I'll survive.  I guess I'm gonna get to bed so I can make it tomorrow.  G'night."

It wasn't my best work so I plan to fix it before I actually teach it.  I actually got to see people which was my highlight of the day!  I spent the evening hanging out with Jen and Brian (alternating) so it was nice to see friends again.  It sure beats hanging out alone!

Friday I didn't feel so well.  My stomach was bothering me and my headache got progressively worse.  I turned in my unit and had a good day with the kids.  When I got home, I spent the entire afternoon/evening/night cleaning.  I did a massive scrub down of our place in the kitchen, living room, bathroom, and eventually my room.  It wasn't too exciting but I feel better that everything is cleaner.  No one was around to do anything so I was a little bummed but just ended up going to bed.

Today wasn't very exciting.  I slept in which was nice!  Then I spent the afternoon job searching and updating my profiles online.  I need to get some ink to print off job applications to start mailing out.  I went out to dinner with Jen T. and Sam which was a nice way to get out and see people for a little bit! :-p  I came back to see that Jill was home which was nice! :)  We talked for a little bit.  I spent the rest of the night hoping to go out or see people but with no luck.  While I waited, I worked on my quote collection and putting them all into one document so I can eventually create a journal of some sort with them on it.  After talking to Jill and hanging out with my thoughts basically tonight, I've decided that I'm at a stable point in my life but it's neither good nor bad...everything is kinda of stationary but nothing is really good and nothing is really bad.  It's wierd though.  I think that having things like this isn't helping my headaches because since nothing is overshadowing everything else, I start to think and stew about all of it.  I guess since everyone is either in bed or away, I'm gonna go get ready for bed now."

"event","Today has been a long day.  It was back to reality again with school but the day went well for the most part.  It was another long, lonely day when I got home working on my unit more.  I've got a rough draft done basically the bare minimum to print off to be able to turn in.  I'll be glad to print it off and be done with it.  I guess my smile for the night was this cute story my mom sent to me:

""A Child's View of Retirement"" 

After a Christmas break, a teacher asked her young pupils how they spent their holidays. One small boy wrote the following:

We always used to spend Christmas with Grandpa and Grandma. They used to live here in a big brick home, but Grandpa got retarded and they moved to Florida. Now they live in a place with a lot of other retarded people. They all live in little tin boxes. They ride on big three-wheeled tricycles and they all wear nametags because they don't know who they are. They go to a big building called a wrecking hall; but if it was wrecked, they got it fixed because it's all right now. They play games and do exercises there, but they don't do them very good.

There is a swimming pool there. They go into it and just stand there with their hats on. I guess they don't know how to swim.

As you go into their park, there is a dollhouse with a little man sitting in it. He watches all day so they can't get out without him seeing them. When they can sneak out they go to the beach and pick up shells that they think are dollars.

My Grandma used to bake cookies and stuff, but I guess she forgot how. Nobody cooks, they just eat out. They eat the same thing every night, Early Birds. Some of the people are so retarded that they don't know how to cook at all, so my Grandma and Grandpa bring food into the wrecked hall and they call it ""pot luck.""

My Grandma says Grandpa worked hard all his life and earned his retardment. I wish they would move back up here, but I guess the little man in the dollhouse won't let them out."

Things are getting more intense though and my unit is not going along as fast as I want it to and I'm getting to take over more time in the classroom.  It's exciting in some ways but nervewracking at the same time.  After school yesterday, Sam took me to Meijer and then we made dinner.  It was nice to hang out with him instead of being here alone since everyone else on campus is gone!  We watched some Will and Grace and he left the season with me to continue to watch!  Thanks Sam! 

Today was actually a snow day!  I was so excited!  I didn't get much sleep Sunday night (or Monday morning) and I surprisingly wasn't really tired during the day but boy was I tired last night!  It was a great phone call early this morning though!  I enjoyed sleeping in and having time to get stuff taken care of!  I spent all day working on my unit more and it's coming along slowly.  I need to know how much she wants handed in ahead of time to know how much more I have to stress about.  I also got to iron my clothes finally which I was glad of!  I know it sounds dorky but it's nice that it's done!  I also got my laundry done and cleaned out my closet.  After watching TV all day, certain shows (and also somewhat recent conversations) made me think about Dustin and all that happened with that situation.  It was wierd because in both of my shows that I watched, they talked about the exact same situation that I went through...twice...and it brought up a lot of emotions I hadn't felt in a while.  Anyway...It's been a lonely night just working on my unit.  Oh!  One good thing did happen!  One of my good friends from high school found me on facebook and I hadn't talked to him since like junior year!  That's one good advantage to this facebook and becoming addicted to it! :-P  Gilmore Girls was very cute tonight and made me think more and miss  some things.  I hope that people are around again soon.  It was very eerie being here alone all day and not talking to anyone at all.  On that note, I'm gonna put in this cute email that my mom sent me.

"event","Well things are still roller coaster-like.  I spent time at just talking with my mom a lot on Friday.  It was kind of emotional actually because we talked about my grandpa a lot and my aunt's relationship with the family and it brought up some emotional subjects.  Basically, he's slowly dying and it's been a very difficult time for him.  He's in a lot of pain and is in pretty bad shape. It's been very hard for us to see him in such bad shape and so miserable.  I just got another update tonight and things haven't changed much.  He still doesn't remember where he even is most of the time and is now in an isolation room (you have to wear sterile clothing into his room now) and to me it seems like a sad way to end your life.  So, we know his time is ending and it's so sad to know that it's not far away.

On a lighter note, when I got back to school Friday night, I got to hang out with Oliver for the last night here in the states.  We ended up talking for a while and sooner or later watched ""Love Actually"".  I still SO want the soundtrack! :-p  Brian stopped by for a little while after the movie and it was nice to all talk.  Saturday, Jill and I had to take him back to the airport after being able to sit and relax and talk.  If you know me at all, I don't like to say goodbye and often end up crying which is what I did like usual.  It was nice having you here in the states again Oliver!  Hopefully we can keep in touch better!  The rest of the day, I spent working on my unit.  I did well with planning out my unit and am making some progress on it but have a long way left to go this week!  Today was a pretty lazy day as well and more of the same thing.  It's wierd being up here alone while most everyone else is on break.  We'll see how it goes I guess.  In the meantime, keep my grandpa in your prayers.  thanks."

"event","Well today is a record day where I actually updated twice! :-p  This morning was a long morning and I spent all of it in the dentist's office.  First I just had a routine cleaning and it went well.  Immediately following that, I had my first (of two) appoints for a crown.  I've never had one before so it was a first.  There was basically a lot of drilling (after numbing of course) and then they put a temporary one on for now so I have to be careful what I eat for the next month.  Great.  When I got home, I had lunch and chatted with Mom and Kelly for a little bit and then spent the rest of the afternoon working on lesson plans for my unit.  I actually made some progress which was good!  Then, we all went to see ""Hitch"" together.  It was AWESOME!  I loved it and definitely hope to buy it when it comes out!  Kelly and I agreed that it was the perfect date movie...we just needed dates! :-p  I really liked it and thought that it was really cute!  If anyone wants to see it, I wouldn't mind seeing it again! (Or going to see ""Meet the Fockers""!)  After the movie, we went out to dinner..of course to Max and Erma's! :-p  There were definitely some good times and laughs!  The best part was imagining frogs without their legs (and arms) but sprouting new legs - having just little stubs!!! :-D hehehe (this came from a conversation about eating gross foods...like frogs legs....you never hear about eating their bodies so we were imagining what they would be like without legs! :-p)  I guess it was somethiing you had to be there for but it was definitely entertaining! :)  After dinner we came home and I looked for some new good books to read and have a few to bring back.  I think since no one is around that I may start one tonight.  After a busier day than usual, I'm gonna finish getting ready for bed."

My dad and I are gonna try to go over it tomorrow I think and maybe he can give me some more suggestions.  My highlight of the day was coming home for a little while.  I surprised Kelly with the Jesse McCartney CD which I knew she had really wanted and the smile and excitement in her was priceless!  She was so happy and beyond happy that made it so worth it for me to get that for her!  He's not that great but she's obsessed with him right now so I made her night and she made my night by getting so excited about it!  It was a pretty quiet (and cold) night tonight.  Once again no one is up or around so I'll probably get ready for bed and read a little.  Tomorrow's gonna be ""early"" cuz I have two doctors appoinments back to back in the morning.

"event","Life has been such a roller coaster lately.  Just when things start to get better (or it appears that things are getting better), the roller coaster takes a turn for the worse or headed in the opposite direction.  It just gets really frustrating.  Today was a pretty lazy day.  I did work out this morning which was good and I felt good afterwards!  I spent litterally all day focusing on balancing my checkbooks and updating all of my records.  It was a tedious job but I think that everything is updated and alright.  I have been working on my resume this evening and I think I'm having issues because I'm too much of a perfectionist sometimes.  After going to our ice cream social, I came back up here and called my house.  I'm going home sometime tomorrow and I don't know for sure what will happen.  I got irritated before today because she claims she couldn't hear me and ended up pretty much hanging up on me so I was annoyed.  I realize that she's stressed right now but I told her that it's hard to sympathize with her when I feel out of the loop and don't know everything going on.  Well come to find out, my grandpa's not doing so hot.  He was supposed to move back to the Catholic home yesterday and it turns out that he's in pretty bad shape that they didn't advise him to leave.  He's still in the hospital (but in a normal room) and apparently his vital signs are really doing poorly.  It doesn't help that he really hasn't eaten in two weeks now.  I found out that my grandma is actually hoping that he dies because she thinks that her life will be easier which is very depressing to hear.  The doctors warned us that it would be a long and rough recovery but not with a very good outlook.  My mom is planning to go back soon but things aren't going so well with Kelly either.  My mom's uncle is a good doctor out in California and my grandma asked for his opinion about Kelly's headahces.  He's heard some research that for kids that have chronic headaches, like her, has a correlation with a hole in their heart.  So, he suggested that they have her go to a cardiologist.  I guess we can hope that if she gets checked out they can rule that out as an issue.  Anyway, it's been a lot of drama lately and pretty uneventful around here.  Maybe things will get more exciting or at least more productive."

I did do some job searching and tried to get applications for substitute teaching so that was good.  Then I took a lunch break and chatted online some.  I spent time also working on my weather unit and trying to decide where to go with that.  I did spend some time then re-working my resume.  I'm not sure exactly how to do and I keep getting different feedback so I'm re-looking at it.  Then Jen and I made a trip to Meijer which proved to be fun and even quote worthy!  When we were leaving, we deicded that we wanted to get something to eat cuz we didn't feel like cooking.  We couldn't really decide.  

Katie:  I just want something cheap.
Jen:  Like a bird?  Cheap! Cheap!
Katie/Jen:  hehehehehehe

It was great and so funny!  It was our thing for the night that's for sure!  I dunno if it's one of those things where you had to be there but it was great!  We got some food and came back here.  It was nice to hang out with her so much!  We watched our Monday night shows together while I trimmed my new awesome pictures to hang on my wall and then got into some...involved conversations.  There were times when things got heated but overall it turned out okay.  When Jen left, I came back into my room and hung up my new pics and worked on labeling my photo album.  I hadn't since the beginning of the summer so I had a lot of catching up to do!  I finally got them finished and you'll have to check them out!

My mom was in a really bad mood when we first saw her which was frustrating but she was much better after a little while.  After lunch, I gave Kelly part of her gift (which involved nail polish) while we wrapped her presents.  She got a ton of really cute clothes so we boxed it all up and then wrapped.  Eventually we got ready for church.  My grandma called and said that my grandpa is stable right now and is moving back to the Catholic home tomorrow which is a good sign but we're a little nervous because they claim he'll get the same care there but we're not so sure.  After church, we came home and I helped my mom make Kelly's birthday dinner.  It's a tradition that the birthday person gets to choose their menu for dinner and dessert.  I got to bring some of the leftovers home to enjoy the next few nights so that's good!  She opened her presents afterwards which was nice!  I helped clean up the whole kitchen which took a while but did get to talk to Brad for a few minutes.  It's been a while since we've gotten to talk so that was nice!  Eventually, I got back here and unpacked and got settled.  Soon after, people came over!  Jen, Jen T., Sam, Kara, and Dave all came over and it was fun to just sit back and relax together!  Brian also stopped by for a few.  It's a great feeling to know that I'm on break right now and can still hang out with everyone!  Next week is just gonna be wierd when I'm here and everyone else is on break but I'll live I s'pose.

Today has been pretty uneventful.  I slept in some.  Got up and Jill made me pancakes which was a great treat!  Then, I eventually got my butt moving and showered.  After showering, I vacuumed and cleaned up a little more from our fun times last night.  Then I decided to start attacking my room.  I hung up my new poster and then spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning, organizing, and eventually vacuuming.  Now my room looks really nice and I'm quite happy with it!  I worked on compiling my quotes after that so that I can make a notebook collection of all my quotes that I like.  Jill and I took a trip to Target then and I bought my first CD in like 2 years! :-p Tonight doesn't sound too exciting right now but hopefully it will just be relaxing!  We'll see what happens."

School has been going well.  We lost one of our students today because after break, she will be going to her ""home"" school again and we will miss her a lot!  One of my favorite students got promoted to 8th grade (effective after break) so that's a pretty cool accomplishment and we're all proud of him!  Other than that, I'm really looking forward to a break from school for a week so I will have some time to get stuff done!

I came home for the night and for tomorrow for Kelly's birthday.  Happy 15th Birthday Sweetie! :)  Anyway, I really had a nice time being home so far!  I got to spend time helping her with spanish - pronouncing words and learning conjugations!  It definitely had it's laughs! :-p  Dad made us dinner (my mom had a bad headache and was in bed most of the time).  I think dessert was the best though!  My dad had bought two chocolate covered strawberries (one for each of us).  Kelly decided to be somewhat seductive so I snapped a pic of her!  When she took a bite, the chocolate shell totally broke away from the strawberry! (Another pic!)  Then, she ate that baby right down to the core and there was not a speck of red left! (Another pic!)  Needless to say, it was rather amusing and definitely fun! :)  Thanks Kelly!  After doing dishes and a little more spanish, we settled down to watch ""The Notebook"".  I really loved it and thought that it was a really sweet story!  Now I want to add that movie to my list of movies to get!  I did cry several times (surprise, surprise) but the story was just so sweet that I couldn't help it!  I'm glad that I finally got to see it!  It would be an amazing movie to watch with a significant other but my sister was the next best thing! hehe  Anyway, after the movie, my mom and I sat and talked for a few and now I'm gonna go decorate the kitchen for my sister's bday and prolly just go to bed since no one is around.

My dad thinks that it's the newest flu which includes headaches, fever, dizziness, upset stomach...all of which I've felt lately and at sometimes worse than others the past few days.  It wasn't bad enough this morning to keep me home.  When I got home, I still felt poopy so I ended up eating dinner.  Katie and I watched last nights shows and then got ready to head to Jenny's when my mom emailed me about my grandpa.  This is the worst of the email:
""Today (Tuesday) he fell again and broke his hip.  The doctor is suspicious that he was having a heart attack when he fell because the EKG showed that his heart was in worse shape than it had been before.  He is at Columbia, in the ER, and will be moved to ICU as soon as there is a free bed up there.  They can't do anything about his hip until his heart stabilizes.  They gave him some morphine to make him more comfortable and make the pain more bearable.  If they can get his heart stable, they will need to do surgery to replace his hip (ball and socket).""  
So needless to say, that pretty much threw me off for the rest of the night.  She said the doctors aren't too optimistic at this point which makes things that much hard.  It's hard going through this right now so I apologize for being moody or more emotional.  If you could just keep him (and my family) in your prayers, I would greatly appreciate it.  Oh.  Hugs are nice too. ;)"

I did spend a little time planning and preparign but for the most part, I didn't have much to do so I read (and finished) my book: ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"".  If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it!  After school, I talked to my Mom online for a little while which was nice.  Then I worked out for a little while.  I'm just feeling frustrated with not having any control (or very little control) in certain situations.  I appreciate that I can talk to some people about it...thanks for being there. ;)  Anyway, I showered and made dinner.  After dinner I watched American Idol with the girls and now am just being bored..."

"event","Well I guess it's been a little while since I updated so I think I'll keep procrastinating more and update! :-p  It's been a while though so I don't know how much I'll remember! :-p 

Wednesday, I didn't feel well and left school early, skipped my seminar, and slept a lot!  It sure felt good to catch up on some sleep.  It's been so hard not sleeping much lately...going to bed later and getting up so early.  I guess all the lack of sleep builds up so I need to make up for it sometime!

Thursday night, I went to Dave's and Kara made us a great dinner!  It was fun to hang out and just relax but unfortunately, I had to leave cuz it wasn't the weekend yet for me.  I did get to spend some time with Jill and we went on a Meijer run.  I almost actually went out dancing because I had caught up on sleep but plans fell through.

Friday was fun!  We had a pretty low-key and fun day.  It was my teacher's birthday so we had fun just celebrating.  We also had a field trip to a local bowling alley and it was definitely a fun time and there was some bonding with one of my kids!  It's kinda cool that I am able to talk with some of them just like peers almost and have that cool connection with them!  After school, I don't totally recall what I did but it probably wasn't very productive.  I ended up hanging out with Brian and then we went dancing.  It was fun because it's been so long since I went out!

Saturday, I slept pretty late which felt great to wake up without an alarm! :-p  I wasn't productive again at all!  I watched my shows that I miss this week and they were all somewhat interesting!  It was nice to see them all again!  Eventually, I showered and Jill and I made another Meijer run before going to Friday's for Sam's birthday.  After dinner, we all hung out at the apartment and just relaxed which was fun!  It was nice to see everyone and to just hang out together until the wee hours in the morning!  It was two really late (or early) nights (mornings) but it was worth it! :)

Today, I slept in somewhat and then got ready to go home for the afternoon.  It's been a while since I've been home and I really miss seeing them and I feel so bad for the tough times my sister, mom, and dad are going through right now so it was nice to spend the time with them!  We just hung out and talked and even ended up playing euchre!  My brother was home too so it was nice to see him and actually talk to him for a little while!  We did go out to dinner at Max and Erma's which was nice! :)  I came back after dinner and worked on a mini-scrapbook for my kids from last semester which I plan to take with me tomorrow!  I have the day off tomorrow so I look forward to going back to see my kids from last semester!  Hopefully I will be more productive tomorrow! :)"

"event","Well, so far the first two days of the week have been pretty uneventful.  I've just been going to school each day.  Yesterday was pretty slow at school because 3 of our kids were absent so we didn't do a whole lot with them.  Oh!  On Monday, Jen and I went to Meijer so I could do some grocery shopping and get stuff so we could make tacos for dinner!  It was definitely fun having something different for dinner!  I have been feeling pretty sleep-deprived lately so I may just take a nap later to try to catch up on some sleep.  Other than that, I haven't really been up to a whole lot lately.  I am looking forward to getting some more of my lesson stuff done so that I can relax again this weekend! :)"

"event","Well, nothing too exciting happened again today.  I slept in somewhat which was nice!  Then I didn't do much productive.  I eventually worked out for an hour which felt good!  I'm not sure if I'm really losing any weight but I feel better and it helps me to feel better.  I showered and got cleaned up but my stomach was acting up.  I heated up some dinner and worked on a special project! ;)  Then, we had Jill's Candle Lite party which was nice!  I had never been to one before and I split some candles with Jen D and Jen T.  Hopefully I can save up some more money and get some of the cute things that I saw! :)  Thanks Jill! :)  I got to talk to Mohamad a lot tonight which was nice!  It's been a while since we had talked on the phone so it was really nice to hear his voice!  Thanks for calling sweetie!  I think I'm just gonna finish out my weekend being unproductive some more! :-p  G'night."

"event","Well it's been a few days since I updated but nothing that earth-shattering has happened to write about.  I had school which is definitely getting better!  I will get to take over another hour next week which will be nice!  Last night was a little more exciting.  I went out to dinner with Kara, Jill, and Jen T. and we ended up going to Max and Erma's which was nice!  We stopped at the mall for a little while and then went to Bubble Island.  After that, we stopped at Meijer to pick up some stuff and went back to the apartment!  We definitely had some good times!  I spent most of the time playing euchre with Jen T. as my partner against Dave and Sam.  We lost the first two games but killed them the last one!  :-p  There were definitely some great times last night even though it got really late!  My favorite quote of the night was from Jill:  (we had just heard some car or bus horn that sounded really wierd) ""That sounds like a little kid bird!"" :-p  Thanks Jill! :)  Today has been a totally wasted day!  I slept in so late and was still tired all day!  I really didn't do anything productive at all!  There was so much snow though!  I just wish that it had come  on a school night so that we could have a snow day! :-p  I'll definitely be praying for some tomorrow night!!  We did venture out to Borders for a little while.  It was pretty snowy though so we came back home.  Ever since, it's been really low-key.  I have been working on my website some but I should be working on lesson plans or something.  Anyway, I'm gonna get back to my website stuff now. :-p  It has become addicting!"

"event","The last two days haven't been too exciting.  Nothing really happened yesterday to update.  Not a whole lot more happened today.  I made a connection with one of our ""troubled"" kids who has been acting out a lot lately.  He and I worked on math today and he asked me why I always work with him but when I suggested I leave, he wanted my help!  He actually sat down and focused for me and didn't like the idea of me taking away any points from him since I haven't had to do that yet.  It's kinda sweet that he cares that much and that I can have that kind of power over him too! :-p  Seminar was very boring tonight...one of my old professors spoke about current laws and procedures and basically just read his handouts to us!  Nothing changed! :-p  We got out a little bit early and I met Brian at work to have someone to walk home with.  I got home to empty place and wasn't in the mood to cook so Brian took me to McDonald's -- gotta love that dollar menu! :-p  It was nice to chat with him and hang out.  I just kinda chilled in my room and ended up spending the whole night working on my banking mess.  All my checkbooks are balanced and my last audit is actually started and working out just fine!  I didn't intend for it to take so long but it's all okay now!  I also have a back up debit card so I don't have to deal with my frustrations of this past weekend.  Then I just tried to clean up my room and get myself organized and chatting online.  I should be going to bed soon but I gotta shower first....we'll see when I get around to it! :-p

"event","Today was a pretty lazy day but nice to spend time with friends!  I slept in then went out shopping some with Jen and Sam.  I tried to get stuff by my bank accounts are all messed up so I'm not too happy about that.  Grrrr!  I need to get that fixed tomorrow before I go crazy.  I went back to Jen's place then and hung out and watched ""The OC"" and now I think I'm hooked on another show! Wonderful! :-p  We made dinner which was nice! :)  After dinner, Jen came over and did my hair again so now it's a little more even and a little lighter.  I like how it turned out! :) Thanks Jen! :)  Brian stopped by for a little bit and we've just been hanging out since then.  I probably should get ready to go to bed soon...we'll see. :-p"

"event","Tonight proved to be somewhat entertaining with a few worthwhile quotes:

Chris (7 years old):  ""You 20- to 30-year-olds are wierd.""
Me: ""And why is that?""
Chris: ""Just cuz I say so."" :-p

A few minutes later, he started to sing Christmas songs...
Mr. F: ""Well, I did make him.  I think that gives me the right to comb his hair in public whether he likes it or not!""

Then Chris started to sing something to the tune of Jingle Bells about being a little seeding! :-p  And he says I'm wierd!


However, the most random thing of the night has caused me to create a survey to get the most responses from: <b>Do you know any guy (or do you yourself) carry a comb in your back pocket?</b>
I told him that I don't know any guys who carry a comb in their back pocket and he thinks that it's strange that I don't know any guys who do so I told him that I could conduct a survey with guys who are my age and inform him of what the current generation does!  So, if you could send me some feedback, I would greatly appreciate it! :)"

"event","It's been a few days since I updated but there's been nothing that exciting to update on.  Friday, I was at school all day and actually got to teach for the morning.  It was nice except for the behavior problems that rose with one student in particular.  The afternoon was kinda nice and more low-key.  I got to see the kids having some fun and practicing skills they had learned too.  It also gave me a chance to get to know the kids a little better as far as things the like other than academically.  I just kinda did my own thing Friday night.  I just cleaned up the apartment and cleaned it well and then attacked my room.  I then settled down and watched ""The Whole Nine Yards"" for the first time and it was alright.  I decided to just go to bed early in hopes that things would go better yesterday.  

I ended up getting almost 12 hours of sleep which was great!  I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn't sleep.  I ended up working out for 70 minutes and I really pushed myself!  I was tired and sweaty when I finished and felt good!  I showered and talked with Katie for a few minutes before she went home.  Then I spent most of the afternoon and evening trying to balance my checkbooks but watched my movie more! :-p  Jen ended up coming over to hang out which was nice and then we made dinner together.  After dinner, I got ready to go out while Jill and Jen had fun hiding chocolates and candy all around my room which I am still finding! :-p  Then we left and Jill and I went to Meijer and I had issues with my debit card which pissed me off...temporarily.  Then Jill dropped me off at Jen's and we had some pre-partying. We went to Sidetracks to meet up with some of her friends and went to Divine.  We dropped off our stuff there, picked up some drinks, and went next door to Pub 13 to hang out.  We went upstairs to the Best Damn Sports Bar and played some pool.  It was fun!  We stopped over in Divine for a little bit but ended up going back to play pool again or hang out.  Then some guys asked two of us to play pool with them and it was fun!  I suck at pool but had some nice shots!  It was definitely a night of randomness, that's for sure! :-p  We got home around 5:15ish so it was definitely a late night or early Sunday morning! :-p hehe  I didn't feel so great this morning and had a bad headache.  After trying to sleep, I took some meds and went back to sleep, and woke up feeling well rested.  Since then, I showered and made a few phone calls.  Mohamad called me and I finally got to talk to him!   It was great to hear his voice and to be able to talk to him again! :)  Thanks for calling sweetie! :)  Since then, I've just been doing some random stuff so for now, that's all.  I'm going to get my butt moving to do something else. :-p"

"event","Had a good day shooting yesterday.&nbsp; Shot 4 rounds of maze clays. did pretty well.&nbsp; Missed at least one everytime I called for a true pair.&nbsp; Kind of irritating.&nbsp; Decided to go up to bob and leai's for dinner with cat.&nbsp; I worry I may have screwed up my skeet game a little bit.

After dinner, I was napping on the couch and the phone rang.&nbsp; Caller-id said it was Travis's cell phone.&nbsp; Surprised, I picked up the phone, it in fact was Travis.&nbsp; He nonchalantly said hello.&nbsp; I told him I was happy to hear that he was alive.&nbsp; He seemed surprised at my concern.&nbsp; 

Appearantly he just needed to get out of town to clear his head a little bit.&nbsp; And had left the country for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; Completely unaware that not telling anyone including his family, or his work(family business) that he was leaving town would create some twinge of panic.
What a f-ing moron.

His parents called me looking for him, fearing the worst I'm sure.&nbsp; And he seems as usual completely oblivious.&nbsp; 
One positive note, he said that he hasn't had a drink for a few months.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a step in the right direction for sure.

Still, pretty unbelievable, all in all."

"event","sometimes I read job posting boards, not because i'm searching a job, but because it sometimes has the same effect as staring at a picture of a serene beach scene in the dead of winter.  I'm in school so can't take a job, but it's fun to look sometimes...  I was peeking around on the <a href=""http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?868"">joel</a> job board and found the best candidate requirement i've seen yet:  Requirements: Enthusiasm for solving interesting problems.

of course it was at google doing something that i'm likely not qualified for, but i'm definitely adding it to my objective in my general resume.  It pretty much sums up all that i've ever wanted from work, the opportunity to work on interesting problems."

"event","a <a href=""http://www.werdupsoftware.com/products/wrdsStatementIntegrator.zip"">tool</a> that takes the csv
files from wrds/compustat and turns them into a standardized balance sheet income statement in a spreadsheet.  It also allows the user to select a valuation xls and then merges the two together so that one can use a template with all of the relevant valuation formulas in it and then with a few clicks have an entirely new valuation analysis for a new company.  No copy/paste, no formatting issues, fewer errors, and less time wasted.


Relies on having Windows, .Net v1.1+ and Excel 8.0+ installed.
(I've tried to wrap as much exception handling in there as possible, since it tries to launch excel when it's done, there's a strong likelyhood that something somewhere will break.  )

Release: Alpha v0.1
Leave a comment if you find a bug.  Maybe i'll fix it."

I was having a strange dream involving a t-shirt quilt.  I wish such a thing really existed and that I had one  :)"

"event","So, i've had 2 or 3 firefox windows open with 10 to 20 tabs each for the better part of a week on a machine with 2BG of ram.  I was trying to click a link and nothing would happen.  I could scroll up and down, move to a different window, but clicking links/buttons just didn't do anything.  So, finally I closed everything and noticed that firefox was still hanging around even though the windows were gone, and it was using 200MB of ram.  No performance degradation, just wierd behavior.  Oh well, I guess there is some firefox-JS memory leak in at least one of the sites that I left open all week, or there is a memory leak in the windows binary, or a memory leak in windows.  Hmm, wonder what the most likely candidate is?  :-P"

"event","finally got the cellphone situation semi satisfactorally resolved.  Immediatedly ordered unlocked replacement phone off of ebay.  And realized that I could borrow a phone from carrie since her and her dad sell used ones on ebay.  Perfect.  Phone was pretty schwag, but worked well.  Was glad to get the new phone.  Finally got all of my numbers back up and running, and backed up as well.

phew!

"event","It has been almost a full 24 hours of no telephone access.  Last night I turned off my phone and put it on the charger and it beeped a message that said 'unable to charge.'  So I turned it on and it said 'insert sim.'

Several incantations of remove battery, remove sim, clean contacts on sim, reassemble phone, and turn on produced the same message.  1 phone call to cingular, and 45 minutes of waiting in a store produced a new sim card that has the same problems.

After getting to UPS i ordered an unlocked one off of ebay.  It'll be here in 4 days.  It really amazes me how dependent the world has become on cellphones... well, my world at least.  There is a slight twinge of panic that accompanies all new, or seemingly new, situations.  But I can't get over how free it feels to know that the phone is going to ring and suddenly interrupt whatever i'm doing or working on.

It is however a drag to have to remember to check my voicemail...

We'll see how it goes.  planning on sleeping like a baby tonight.

An just days of fun after fun after flirting with Cody, Adem, Justin, Makie, Tim, Brad, Anthony, Devon....but mostly Cody!!! It was a blast and I'm just like soo ganna miss all of it!!! Especially not working someone elses shift and WORKING for FREE at Western Bagel when it was slow an they woul all be like ""what do we look like your survant? you can make your own damn begal!! just here put this shirt on and come aroun back!! LoL!! I love Al he's like the tightest manager!!! That and he is like totaly down with my liking Cody and totaly encourages it!! Along with everyone else that works there!!!

Well, I know that I'm...in a way ready for school!!! I like finished all my shopping and got everything that I nee for school!!

"event","how can one fucking phone have soooo many damn problems???

theres a list that can go on forever!!!
1. im not getting that much reception
2. for some odd reason my voice mail has been busy for the last past 3 weeks!!
3. it doesnt charge all the way
4. when you make a 1 min phone you lose 2 bars of energy
5. it cuts me off in the middle os a conversation!!
6. i can hear my voice echo when i talk to someone!!
7. if you stay in the same spot...it cuts you off, but when you move...you can talk for about an hour b4 it dies
8. it turns off on its own and wont turn on when it is fully charged!!
9. you have to dial a phone number twice befor it will go through!!
10. if your in my phone book, when you call it doesnt show you name...just the number!!(like im ganna memorize all those phone numbers)
11. IT CUT ME OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF MY VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH CODY!!!!

OMG!!!WTF!!!i hate my cell phone...and now that i have a job...i have to pay for half of this fucking shit that doesnt even work!!! i hate it...i mean the only thing that its still good for it just to stay there and look cute with the different face plates that match wat im wearing!!! 

oh and get this...i have the 3360 right...well AT&T decided to fucking discontinue the phone...they no longer carry it...but waite...i still have a one year coverage on this shit thats not up...but hey because they dont have it anymore...they dont cover it...but on the bright side...according to them...they have the new 2260...they use the same face phates...so now i can buy both the 3360 and the 2260 for the phone and they buttons are way cooler on the 2260 then the 3360 just cuz it looks more futuristic...(see when they told me that i was like cool..change my phone for that one...the only thing different is the light...the one i have is yellow and the other one is blue..same me buying the lights) but get this...i have to pay $100!! plus tax and i have to get the one year coverage!!!

my fucking question is for what!!!! i have it i just need to change this shit that i have cuz ts not working...and there fiucking telling me i need to buy a new one....well WTF IS THE COVERAGE FOR!!! everyone i asked just told me to buy the new phone...but my mom wont halp me...my bro said no...so thats like my entire pay check to get the phone with all the shit they have to fucking attach that doesnt work once you need it!!!!"

"event","so i just found out that nicki blocked me!!! wow!!! and to think that she said that she would never do anything like that!!! i kno that posting that thing on my lj was stupid...but i didnt want to put down everthing and i didnt!!! but i guess that for some reason i forgot to cut that out!!! when i read what she wrote about me...i was actually shocked!!! it was like she didnt even kno me!!! but i dont kno...i mean...i feel so stupid!!! everyone always asked me why i dodnt believe in bestfriends...well theres your fucking reason!! take nicki as an example...she stoped talking to me once we got back from laughlin!! OMG i just realized something...that also happened with kristina...she stoped talking to me after the trip!!

wow!! i dont kno!! i dont kno wat to say or wat to do!!

im surprised taht she didnt block me off of her live journal friends thing..well she doesnt have to...ill never go in there and read wat she wrote...i dont care!! i mean in a way it hurts that im losing her as a friend..or from wat it seems like...but i mean whe ever i try to tell her something...or help her with something...she always took it as if it was because i didnt like that person...like when i told her that when ashley flirted with danny and it hurt her...she yelled at me.. and protected ashley untill she talked to her dad or mom..i dont remember and said that she was lucky to have a friend like me!! 

but hey...whatever she decides now..its all up to her..i mean im like sitting here...cring for so many reason and this is one of then not giving a fuck abotu anything... life... school... my future... friends... everything!!

its funny...when i thought that nicki would never turn her back on me..and when i remembered what my cousin sarah told me about how nickis a friend for life...this happens!!! so that tells you something...cuz i got something out of this shit!!!

i hate everyone!!! its like they all turn there backs on me do shit!! and im the idiot that stays friends with them!!! FUCK THAT!!! i said that things were ganna change and they start right now..today!!"

"event","omg...im like soo starting to hate the fact that i ever got a summer job in which i can be social and the fact that i told all my friends about it out of the excitement that i actually got a job on my own!!!!  heres the deal...i go today and talked to my boss...it was fine he needed to get information about me and i talked to him about me hours..it was cool...except for that final comment...""oh by the way melissa, a few of us had already noted that everytime you work, your little friend with the short hair about here (made the motion) is always here when your working..now its cool some times but just dont make it a habbit that everytime your working one of your friends comes and bugs you..i dont want to have to talk to you about this again!"" and soo on...he really didnt yell but he shure made it seem like i just got points deducted ok something like that but i can compleatly understand where hes coming from!! and to tell you the truth there really pissing me off too!!! like all the comment that gives them hints that 1) there my friends 2) that they want free ice cream or 3) there just there to bug me and not get anything!!!! on my FIRST day of work when i was in training i got the comment ""meli i only have $4 ::giggles::"" and ""hey my mom wants free ice cream"" ""yeah i want some free ice cream""!!! DAY 2: ""oh hey wats up"" ::all giggling::!! well i mean i think that hutch ( my boss and the owner has a point) i kno that thats not a place for all my friends to come and bug but i dont think that they seem to understand that...the funny thing is that they dont really act like my friends unless they want something ::cough:::nikki, tasha:::cough:: oh and the one who was taging along who i dont even kno helia and asking for a job...which brings up the next comment that they all noted...""oh yeah you can get a job here and besides you kno melissa, she ganna get nicole a job she can get you one too!!right??"" WTF WAS THAT SHIT ABOUT?!?!?! CUZ IM LOST!!!LIKE I KNO HER TO GET HER A FUCKING JOB THERE!! oh and my all time favorite ones would have to be when they tease me with the fucking tips!!! AND I QUOTE:: ""yeah throw her a penny..shell have to sing!!"" (WTF DO I LOOK LIKE YOUR PERSONAL FUCKING ENTERTAINER?!?!) "" melissa here you go now sing"" ""oh put money in shell have to sing"" ""sing God damn it or ill get you fired""!!! (NOT EVEN DEYA WHO CAME BOUGHT ICE CREAM AND TIPED ME $5 ASK FOR A FUCKING SONG...AND EVERYONE EXPECTS ME TO SING FOR A FUCKING CENT!!!) what ever i kno that this isnt the first time that i get in trouble for something but i have a feeling that it this keeps up...i have a feeling that it will be the reason why im fired!!! i got this job all on luck.. and this is why i may lose it??? its just too bad that not everyone that contributed to all this shit wont get to read it!!

Heres the thing,i feel that all my friends only use me for the time htey want me there or want something of or from me!! and to tell you the truth i really dont need this shit... im known as the rich one of the group and everyone comes to me when they need cash and shit, but when i need them there the first to say no without even knowing how much i need later to go off and buy all this shit to eat for themsleves!!! WTF!! That and they all come to me for shit...but when it comes to making plans...im always the first one left out and the last one invited all cuz they want something from me!!! (::and i dont need to say names for them to kno who they are::) OH SO NOW YOUR BITCH ASS DECIDES TO INVITE ME!!! i dont kno i want to keep the friendship but then again when you think about it...what friendship if there to keep...the one in my wallet?? cuz that aint  friend!! im glad that this school year is over, now its summer vacation i got a tight ass job and most of all none of them!! the gold diggers!! its funny i was told that the real friends that you make are in hight school and that after highschool you will learn who your true friends are...but at the rate im going, i have no idea who the hell my friends are!! i kno a lot about them and they do me...but its not the same as it would be if we were closer. i dont believe in a best friends, for more then one reason...i mean everytime i have a best friend, they always screw me over and i end up getting hurt, so i dont want them.. everyone in me group is like who you known me for so and so years...i should be your best friend!! but how can anyone ask of that and then turn around and exclude me in everything!!! i really dont care right now!! i guess i should go by what my brother says about family and change it to them...""fuck them"" i kno that they will all read this and then thing about it and have second thought, but i dont care...next year i plan to switch where i hang out and just become closer with a lot of other people!! i guess the real friends i never really thought of them like that!!! i have been under a lot of stress and i really didnt have any time to think about everything...but deep down inside, i think that all the time i knew what i had to do, just didnt kno what make come of it...then again..that is just a chance that i will have to take and face it the want i put it out.. up front and expressing myself!"

"event","Yesterday was quite good, well most of it was good anyway. As some of you may know, most people in the local area were looking looking forward to a highly anticpated open-house party which would be held by Willem (Darkness lead singer lookalike whom i have mentioned in previous entries), AJ Smith (Winmalees spoilt rich party kid) and Nick's friend Bonnie and would have around 500 people. Unfortuneatley this party did not go ahead due to the fact that AJ Smith only asked his dad (who owns the property where the party was to be held) if he could have a 500 people party the night before. His dad's reply was simply ""Fuck no!""

We were quite disappointed and to resolve this disappointment the solution was a small shindig at my place. It started off slowly but gradually became better as more alcohol was consumed. 

I ended up hooking up with Peta which was really nice. After that, we sat on the balcony and just talked for ages, it was really nice and was really good to talk about stuff. I got heaps cut cos though cos I ruined my heaps good shirt. We were making out and she backed me into a pot plant which dripped dirty water all over the back of my shirt and left really bad stains and I didnt even notice them until the next morning :S. 

Kegan (Wanker-face) pissed me off bigtime throughout the whole night. He was talking non-stop bullshit that no one at all paid attention to in a constant attempt to try and impress both Cass and Peta and on top of that he was contstantly insulting others (particularly me) amd putting them down so that he could feel better about himself and because he thinks it makes him look cooler. If Cass and Peta weren't there, I would have kicked him out but I didnt want to cause a bitchy scene as is what usually happens when you have a go at Kegan. However that doesnt mean that I wasnt tempted, particularly when me and Peta were together and he comes over and starts saying ""Go Jimbo! Your a legend! Yeah!"". I'm like ""No Kegan! Your a Tool! Go Away!"". I swear on that night Kegan possessed a wanker level that surpassed even that of Mark Holden's which is quite a feat indeed.

Soon I kicked everyone out, cept for Peta, Cass and Nickus. We just sprawled out on the couch and watched rage, which featured some very suss clips indeed. We went to sleep at about 3 in the morning and got up at 7:30 because thats when Peta got up (She firstly ruins my shirt and then wakes me up, this means war!). Damn early morning people! Anyway all in all it was good time, and it was heaps good to spend more time with Peta. I dont think that anything else interesting will happen at all between now and the end of the HSC besides study so if I dont write anything until then I hope you will understand. Anyway, until next time, take care and dont take shit from anyone at all.

"event","Today I would like to bid farewell to Ramones Guitarist, Punk Pioneer and Legend Johnny Ramone who died peacefully in his sleep today at the age of 55 after a long battle with prostate cancer.

Johnny didnt have looks, he didnt have charisma and didnt have a vast amount of musical talent but he had three chords, three chords which would lay down the foundations to punk rock and continue to influence future generations to a degree that words are unable to comprehend. 

The Ramones were the prototype punk band, if it werent for them we would not have the Sex pistols or The Clash and punk would not be established as a genre of mainstream culture. Punk Rock would not exist as we know it today.

So now I say goodbye to Johnny Ramone, a true rockstar and one of the greatest punk rock stars ever. I'm sure you'll have a great life partying down with Sid Vicious, Joe Strummer and your fellow band mates Dee Dee and Joey on that giant safety pin in the sky.

Goodbye Joey, your legacy will live on forever throughout the hearts of any true rockfan. So long my mop haired, leather jacket wearing friend..."

"event","Hey, havent written here for a while...
Got my trial HSC which really blows to say the least. I've been busy studying (or trying to at least) so they'res really not that much to write about. Whats changed? lol

Last Saturday night was yet another Saturday night that I do not have a clear memory of. I went to Ryan Murphy's party way out Yellowrock way (which was probably not the most intelligent thing to do considering I my trials started the following Monday). The party was really shit and defied all the great expectations we had. We were told that there was gonna be a couple of kegs and a couple of hundred people. What we got was a very mediocre shindig with about 20 people, and a mere few Coronas in an esky that we were allowed to drink, but touching anything else in the esky belonged to Ryan's older brothers and prohibited. We didnt bring any drinks of our own as we assumed kegs would be there.

After about an hour and a few drinks the party wasnt getting any more interesting, I was sitting at a table with about 7 other guys, doing absolutely nothing except talking crap and listening to the crap music that was being played at the party. I was faced with two choices 1. Leave or 2. Make the party interesting myself by stealing the forbidden alcohol which belonged to Ryan's Brothers who would probably beat the shit out of me if they caught me. Being the intelligent person I am, I chose the second option.

I stole quite a few drinks from those eskys, found an untouched bottle of Smirnoff ice and took a few good shots of Southern Comfort and tequila and before long the party improved slightly. 

Anyway the rest of night was pretty lame. Kegan threw up all over himself and spent the night in the back of the ute which he fell out of. I ended up walking trashed 6 kms from Yellowrock to my house which was, well...very stupid. It was pitch black and and dead quiet and I couldnt see a thing at all. Some big dog chased me which scared the living shit out of me and caused me in my drunken running to trip over a rock or something (I'm not exactly sure what it was)but I fell face down on the ground where I remained for a few minutes before realising that i had to get home some time that night and picking myself up and moving on. 

I finally reached the servo after what seemed like forever and I remember talking to some guys there faintly as I walked past. Lucky I didnt get rolled in the state I was in. The next thing I remember is waking up in my own bed with a killer headache and a phone that lost all its credit.

It wasnt the most enjoyable night, but it was a night all the same, I guess.

No parties, no getting drunk, no hooking up, no new CDs, not a single thing worth mentioning at all.

In good news theres an awesome party this weekend where *drum roll* THE BEER IS ON TAP!!! thats right you heard me, a huge open house with kegs. Apparently the party is gonna have like a few hundred people there!!!

In Bad news, the trial HSC exams are just around the corner. I've been studying 2 hours a night for the past few weeks and I thought that was pretty good until some guy in my class told me that he studies 5 hours a night with out any breaks. Thats like more than half your daily time when your awake and not at school, gone!!!

Study is shit, Trials are shitm the HSC is shit and the board of studies and department of education have both been added of my list of poeople to kill along with Harley James, Mr Hopkins and Charlie Sheen. 

Hope I can go to this party, but dont really want a hangover on my last day of study before the exams so I am faced with a life altering decison: 1. Killer kickass party or 2. My future. Uh, I think I'll go with the party

"event","Well I thought I had a pretty decent night at Wager's shindig but that was like a kindergarden slumber party compared to what happed Last Night, in fact almost every party I've been to before this one seems like a Dungeons and dragons gathering now.

Well we heard that a friend of Mick's who we dont know was having a massive open house party above the bottle-o at Faulconbridge. We headed from nicks to the bottle-o itself, bought our alcoholic beverages and headed to the play equipment at Fauclonbridge primary school to down some moonshine before heading to the party.

When we first got there, there wasnt very many people. The host was heaps friendly and pointed to the fridge where there was two cases of beer we could help ourselves to, which we and harley did straight away.

Anyway, we left the house for a little bit and walked across the road to the servo because the party was still a bit slow, we came back less than minutes later and the party had already grown so much bigger. I quickly got into more beers, while harley got into his precious moonshine.

As the house became more packed and people got more drunk I started to socialise with lots of people. I met some heaps cool Punk dude called Ben. He looked heaps hardcore, wearing denim and he had this really tall spiked mohwawk but he was probably one of the most friendly guys at the party. 

Some cool chick called Kellie put a hair clip in my hair which held my hair back and made me look pretty. I ended up keeping it in there for the whole party, not even realising I still had it in there.

Nick and I met this other bunch of cool guys. One of them wore a tweed jacket and a scarf and was a dead ringer for Justin Hawkins, the lead singer of the Darkness (apparently everyone tells him that all the time). We sculled a couple of beers with them, then and jumped around singing and air guitaring to Guns N' Roses songs. This was really my kind of party!

After this point as I consumed more and more beer, and smoked more and more cigarettes things become more and more hazy. Drinking and smoking actually got me a girl's phone number. Funny story: I walk up to her off my face and say (in true Butthead style) ""uh...hey can I like have a cigarette or something, if you like have any?""

""Yeah sure she replied,"" as she gave me a cigarette and lit it up for me

""So...uh...would it like be cool if I uh...got your number and stuff so we could like meet up sometime or...uh... something like that""

""Sure thing,"" she said as she keyed her number into my phone. 'Still got that British charm,' I said to myself, walking away with a grin on my face. It was pretty cool, but I have no idea what she looked like or what her name was. Oh well, maybe time will tell.

Anyway the rest of the night was pretty cool. Harley threw up, cos he drank too much moonshine and I had to stop these dudes from shaving his eyebrows. The party went on till 3:30, we went back to Nick's where I had a really shitty sleep and woke up with a killer hangover and 6 numbers in my phone (only 2 of whom I remember). The cool thing is that going to this party got us invited to lots of other cool parties in the future (rocker parties) which I'm really looking forward to.

"event","Well last night was really awesome... well at least I think it was because I can't remember most of it!

Me, Nick and Rankin headed to Wager's party dressed up in our finest rocker attire. We made a quick detour to the bottle-o on the way. Nick and I put our money together and he goes in to get a bottle of Jim Beam which will be split between the two of us. Instead, he comes out with a bottle of Redneck bourbon that I've never heard of before: ""Back Water Bourbon"". A fact that adds further to the appeal of the drink is that it is made by the same company that makes Comrade vodka - The vodka that is responsible for making Keagan become possessed and talk devil talk.

We got to Wager's and started downing shots almost straight away. Soon half the bottle was gone and we didnt feel the slightest bit intoxicated. After a few shot races, all that remained in the bottle was the backwash, we also had a shot of chris' dad's home brew but we still didnt feel all that drunk. Then I tried to walk and almost stumbled over straight away. After that things started to get a bit hazy.

Straight after that Alex, Sarah, Ken and Myself drove to Jared Pecotich's house so that we drag him along to the party. When we got there I stood by the car where his folks couldnt see me and fired up a cigarette.

Sarah pranked Jared so that he would come outside, jared answered and said ""I'm already at the party, my dad just dropped me off!"". At that very moment Jared's dad pulled up, and called out the window, ""How ya going kids? Jared's already at the party"". For those of you who dont know, Jared's parents are very strict religious parents who condone rebellious behaviour of any kind and think highly of me. Judging by this you can understand why I was more than a little anxious smoking a cigarette and standing on their drive way. I awkwardly hid the cigarette to the side of me before walking across the road and taking one last drag. Jared's dad goes ""Whats that in your hand James?"". I was like ""Uh...ummmm..thats...a...nothing"". I quickly threw it down, crushed it and got into the car and back to the party.

The rest I cant really remember. I remember smoking on the balcony with Nick, where somehow we got onto the topic of Jim Morrision. This led to Nick re-enacting part of Jim Morrisons life over the edge of the balcony. Your a fucking legend, Nick. I salute you to the highest level.

The other things I remember are Harley turning up and me and him stealing some more of Wager's dads grog and walking Nick back to harleys then walking home. I also remember lots of male bonding as we frequently put our arms around each other. How Nice.

Judging by the lack of stuff I remember you're probably thinking that this was a great night for me and bloody oath it was. I didnt even have a hangover the next morning. In future me and Nick are getting Back Water Bourbon every time.

"event","Today I had to work on a group drama project, we rewrote our whole script which was cool because our old one kinda sucked. I didnt want to go, but now at least I can say I that I did some study these holidays and the planning a lot more fun than I expected it to be. 

The one thing I dont like about the play is the addition of a comical dancing routine for the introduction of the show when me and Josh act as a boy band and for thos who dont already know- There's nothing more that I despise in this world than dancing. For me dancing is the lowest of low, no matter how hard I try, no matter how many times I practice I just cant get the steps right. The likelihood of me being lebonese is actually greater than that of me being able to perform a few coreographed dance steps. I'm not bullshitting you either. If you want proof then all you have to do is find the video footage of our Q theatre performance. It was a movement piece and I got absolutely nothing right, in fact I ran off stage in the wrong direction and had to run back across the stage again after we finished.

Besides dancing of any kind (with the exception of headbanging, if you classify that as a dance) is a bit pansy for a guy who devotes his life to macho the code of long hair and leather, but thats beside the point anyway, lol - I cant dance and if I do then the play is most definitely screwed. The only dancing that I will take confidence in doing is dancing at the Year 12 formal and dancing with my wife when I get married, if i get married but thats about all. When it comes to the dance floor I'm about as unco as an a French poodle in a pool full of hungry pirahnas

"event","Well it turned out that no one was online tonight. So as a last resort to cure my boredom I turned on the box and tuned into the Ten's lastest new ""real-life"" drama - The OC. The opening credits (which featured hip music coupled with the faces of an entire cast of good looking young people with perfect hollywood features and perfect bodies) did nothing but further my impression of the show from the bombardment of advertisements 10 airs 24/7. What I expected was a painfully superficial, plastic, trendy, hip American teen drama and....well I guess thats exactly what I got. 

But there was something very different about this drama, I'm not sure if it was the strong fumes of insect spray that I had used not long before to kill a huntsman but I actually found myself enjoying the OC, yes despite the lack of mindless violence, loud rock music, and flesh eating zombies I found myself enjoying it.  Why, you ask? I'm not entirely sure but I'll try to explain as best I can.

Well the world of which the show is set in, is a complete world of plasticity where everyone is good looking and rich (even the old people are good looking and rich), now most people would hold this against the show but I think its great. I mean look, real life is boring and I dont really see the point in trying to replicate something that sucks that where you could have beach front parties where all the girls are absolutely gorgeous, not to mention barely clothed. Lets face it a battle between fantasy and reality, fantasy wins hands down every single time. I mean if J.R.R Tolkien chose to write about how many adult diapers he had to buy each day to serve his old age, instead of writing Lord of the Rings, No one would have bought any of his books. The OC is a fantasy world, a complete escape from the painfully boring confines of reality and I guess thats the reason why it appeals so much, In the same way that heavy metal does I guess but no where near as good. Would be better if there was an reanimated undead corpse somewhere in the show though.

How does it rate on the Heavy Metal Scale of Review:-

Girls: Are you Kidding? Theres more hot chicks in the OC than there are Lebs in Bankstown not to mention that a substantial portion the older women are milfs . The main chick (I forget what her name is cos I was too busy staring at her) is so damn hot, shes a bit on the thin side though. I wouldn't like to have sex with her though cos I might snap her in half (I can tell I'm gonna get a lot of bad comments back for this statement, lol) 5/5

Drugs and Alcohol: Alcohol is really always common at the parties, particularly champagne at the dinner parties. From what I seen theres no sign of drugs in the show yet, though I'm counting on it. There was no one drunk in this episode either but I give it a 3 because I'm almost certain we'll get to see more fucked up people in the future. 3/5

Violence: Not as brutal and as frequent as I'd like but there's no denying its there. The main dude and the main girl's jock boyfriend are always getting into the odd punch up here and there and there was a punch up at the end. However the violence is pretty mediocre and will not impress the average heavy metal fan to any great extent. 2/5

Rock n' Roll: In short there is no metal or hard rock or even punk to compliment the sound track. My suggestions: I personally think that the OC could use a few tinges of speed metal, grindcore, death metal and maybe even some black metal in the soundtrack to personify emotions and feelings more. Cannibal Corpse's ""I will kill you"" should be used throughout the show, to display that even the nicest of characters have dark sides to them on occasions. Carcass' ""Genital Grinder"" should be used to show the pain caused to the main character due to the opposite sex. Mayhem's ""Chainsaw Gut Fuck"" should be used in the opening credits of the show to give a bright and happy introduction while a Slayer song should be thrown in here and there cos Slayer works with everything. 0/5   

Monsters: No monsters so far which gets me a bit cut. I mentioned throughout the entry but I really wanted to see a flesh eating zombie and that view still stands, or even a better an burnt-to-death serial killer who kills the OC kids in their dreams to avenge his death. I've still got my hopes up high for some monsterage to come along later in the series 0/5

Final Verdict: Like Girl TV, this show's main strength in the teenage metal community lies largely on the eye candy that is on display. However unlike Girl TV, this show is actually watchable without putting your television set on mute. It gets a 10/25, a score which might at first seem bad. But it is a score that a superficial American teen drama will probably never ever come near again. I will probably watch it again unless something better comes on Tuesday nights, or someone interesting comes online :P.

Went to Luke's 18th last night, took a 6 pack of Toohey's Extra Dry which got me a little drunk and I smoked a couple of cigars that Adrian flogged from his work, which hit the spot. I'd like to thank Luke for a great party.

Other than that, nothing has been particularly interesting. I feel really bored and uninterested with just about everything lately, dont know why exactly. Don't worry though I'm not about to brood in angst and write angry lyrics like some disgruntled Korn fan. 

Its just that nothing really seems to matter at the moment, I couldnt give a shit about anyone, anything or where the fuck my future's going. The pressure of the HSC and all that bullshit dont mean shit to me. I just want school and all that shit to be over so that I can go to England already, go to Donnington and take so much acid that I'll have a hole burnt right through my stomach.

Hopefully something really worthwhile happens during the next week of the hols. Theres not much to do when you're without a girl, without a car, without a job. Boredom is killing me!!!!

"event","Nothing paricularly interesting happened today, except I found a packet of Winfield Blue cigarettes in my draw which had been hidden there for a couple of months. Anyway, I had one before my folks got home and it was the most disgustingly dry cigarette that I have ever had the pleasure of tasting, in fact my throat still burns. They were bad enough when me and Nick had one ages ago. Oh well, I guess you can't really expect much from a full pack of cigarettes found behind Domino's Pizza.

Whats more interesting is the week ahead. My folks are goin' away for a whole week which means ""PARTAE TIME"", unknowingly to my parents. Cass and Pie are coming up on Wednesday which is when my shindig is scheduled. I just hope it doesnt end up like last time, where i wake up with a hangover to find beer bottles, bongs and cigarette ash all over my back veranda. Disrespectual people! 

Anyway aside from having the house to myself, I'm also going camping and I have Chris' party and on the Saturday of next week I have Luke's 18th. Not a bad week lined up if I say so myself. I just hope Kieran and Jerry dont ruin camping by trying to bring Kayla along. Stupid Bitch! Anyway thats about all, So long and goodbye.

I met this really gorgeous chick in the Heavy Metal section of Leading Edge in Penrith Plaza as both our hands touched an Iron Maiden record at the same time, we fucked in an elevator, then fucked for the next 4 hours, ignoring everyone that walked in. Riding my Harley back home, i saw a Korn fan get totalled by semi trailed causing him to fly into a car full of wogs. It was the greatest three days of of my life!

Actually as much as i would have liked to have liked all of the above to happen its unfortuneately false, I did really have sex with the gorgeous chick though....what?....don't look at me like that!....okay, I didnt have sex with a gorgeous Iron Maiden loving chick but I know someone who it happened to in the past 3 days though....okay, so I dont but you can imagine what it would be like though, right?


Anyway, life is quite dull, i have nothing cool to write about except that on Monday we went on an excursion to the Jewish museum and our tour guide was this cool Jewish holocaust survivor named Eddie. He was a champ

Anyway theres nothing else worth mentioning so I'm going to bed.

Napalm Death's Best Of is a classic album from one the finest bands in Death Metal and VB is one of the finest beers around in...uh..beer. 

I would normally be watching rage in about 5 minutes, except Outkast are guest programming and they've picked mostly shitty R&B clips. Oh well If I'm still awake in about in an hour or so I might watch it just to see the clip for ""Take On Me"" by Aha which is a pretty damn cool clip considering it was made in the 80s.

"event","Last night I had a strange dream, actually it was more like a vision. I was lying in bed fast asleep when I was suddenly awoken by the sound of a motorcyle engine. I sat up to see a heavenly white light creeping out from behind my bedroom door. The door slowly creaked open itself to reveal nothing but a purely white mist and the light that shone through it, while the sound of the motorcyle grew closer and closer. 

Suddenly like a valiant knight of Camelot on his noble steed, a mysterious figure slowly emerged from the myst on a Harley Davidson. As he approached I soon realised that the mysterious figure was Rob Halford, the lead singer of legendary Heavy Metal Band Judas Priest. He was dressed head to toe in his trademark uniform of studded leather, complete with biker hat and matching sunglasses to top it off. I sat there lost for words and full of admiration, confused why and how the heavy metal community's favorite homosexual biker had come to me in a dream like some godly figure.

Halford spoke slowly but powerfully in his gruff Birmingham accent ""James Sadler""

""Thats me,"" I answered ""Not meaning to be rude Mr Halford but what on earth are you doing here in my dream? At this time of the night in my dreams I'm usually naked and having sex with Tara Reid. No offense but a crusty, gay, British biker isnt really much of a replacement"" 

""James Sadler,"" He went on ""I was sent hear to talk to you reguarding the direction of your seemingly pointless life. The long deceased Gods of Heavy Metal: John Bonham (Drummer of Led Zeppelin), Bon Scott (Lead Singer of AC/DC) and Chuck Schulinder (Lead Singer of Death) have made you the chosen one, the one who will revive long lost ways of REAL Heavy Metal. You will embark upon a quest using long hair, leather, guitar solos and actual musical talent as your weapons to fight the evil that is the Nu Metal scum of Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Disturbed and all the other vermin that plagues the media and the minds of the Youth. ""

""I bravely accept,"" I said to Halford proudly ""But where on earth to I begin""

"" 1. Grow your hair really really long and never brush it, dont brush your teeth and wear only leather, ripped denim and Heavy Metal shirts. 2. Become a washout by developing an addiction to alcohol, cigarettes heroin, speed, marijuana, dish washing liquid and anything else you find around the house that has CAUTION written on its label 3. You will move to London England, there you will form a band that will conquer the world, becoming the next Spinal Tap and in doing so taking old metal back to its rightful throne""

There was lot of stuff to remember so I jotted it all down in a notepad while Halford dictated it to me. When he finally finished I said to him, ""Thanks Halford, for giving my life some direction but before I go I have to ask you one more thing: Arent rockstars who deliver important messages to people in dreams to people in dreams supposed to be dead? I mean, I've heard of John Lennon appearing in dreams regularly but hes been long dead and your still alive. It doesnt make much sense that you're here, now does it?""

""No, it doesnt really,"" Halford sighed ""After the last record I made was so terrible that no one bought it, I had to make amends by taking up a second job""

""Ah, I see now,"" I replied satisfied that I was now able to make some sense of this dream

""Cheerio Lad, and good luck with your destiny! I'll check on your progress when you come and see Judas Priest perform live on their world tour next year!,"" Halford bid farewell as he gracefully flew up on his bike and disappeared smashed through the celing as he did so ""Uh... you may wanna get a guy round to look at that""

I waved as he magestically disappeared into the sky like the modern-day Jesus he is. I salute you Halford!

"event","What the fuck is with Kayla trying to merge herself into our group? In fact she actually considers herself to be part of the group now. Can't she just get the fucking message that she has no friends besides her beloved Jerry ""Floppy Cock"" D'Asscumpcao?

Whats even worse is that Kieran invited her to go on a camping trip with us on the holidays, after Jeremiah ""Limp Dick"" D'Asscumpcao asked if she could go. The camping trip is normally a predominantly guy thing where we get trashed, smoke weed and talk guy stuff and now Kieran and Jerry for some dumb reason I'm not entirely sure of have decuded that it is a good idea to bring Kayla along with us. And they still do this, even when they know exactly how i feel about her. Its not like she's gonna do anything that we will benefit from unless you consider sucking face with Mr Jerimiah ""Cant Get It Up"" D'asscumpaco in front of us the whole time beneficial.

Well I went off at Kieran (Cheers to Nick and Rankin for their support, by the way) and after a good 15 minutes of thorough arguing over the situation, I told Kieran that he can choose either Kayla or me and then I'll know where our friendship stands (Yeah I know it sounded dramatic, but I thought it needed to be said so I spoke my mind and have no regrets). Kieran said he chose me over kayla, no contest but he's been known to change his mind in the past.

Why am I so completely opposed to Kayla going, you ask? Well I dont have feelings for her anymore (I cant stand the sight of her) and if I did I'd  be sure to write them down in here. No, theres theres several other reasons why I dont want her going. 

1. Because shes a dumb, fake, ditzy bitch who tries to blow smoke up our asses just so she can be accepted in our group. Shes so fake to me in such an annoying over-the-top way that I just want to start stones in her direction 

2. Because while I dont have feelings for her anymore, I'm still hurt by the fact that she left me for Jerimiah ""Placid Snake"" D'Assumpacao. I feel like a failure, like I screw up everything and my self-esteem plummets right down. I guess, I'm annoyed because while my life has been nothing but a constand downward spiral in the past few months, Jerry's has been fabulous. He's lost his virginity, He has a great relationship, hes happy with himself and everyone treats him like hes king shit despite what he did to me, one of his own best friends. Hopefully this resentment goes away and I regain some of my lost self-esteem.

In Good News, Cass and Pie are coming up to stay during the hols! Yay!!! Its been so long since I've seen them and it will be great to catch up with them again. Its one of the few things I'm looking forward to.

P.S Although I think you've probably got it by now due to my subtle messages throughout the post, Jerry couldn't get it up and has to use viagra!!! (No Bullshit)"

I'm not entirely sure what we've been doing in class in the last 12 months because 99% of the time I'm able to block out her incessant rambling. Sitting at the back of the class and sniffing whiteout usually does the trick, but even that wasn't enough to prevent me from wanting to punch myself in the genitals. Not even Heavy Metal could save us, as we both left our disc-mans at home. Me and David did the only thing we could think of, write song lyrics for our newly established Grindcore / Thrash / Death / Power Metal outfit: Double Bolted !!! (Well the name might be changed later on for obvious reasons, for those who are familiar with the concept of what double bolting is)

Our band is like a cross between Napalm Death and Gwar, except with less talent and much worse lyrics. The lyrics are so grotesque and obscene that they could come from none other than the fucked up minds of ourselves. Heres a few of he song titles:

1. Double Bolted
2. Cunt-O-Saurus
3. BDSM Gerbil
4. St Anus
5. Mootalica
6. Hose Up Yer Arse

"event","Well my adventure began when I caught the train up to Winter Magic Festival with Harley and Nick which stalled about half way and wouldn't move for another 2 whole hours when another train was able to come along and push it up the mountain. 

We were understandably bored and pissed off, but time passed as we talked to this crazy old pot smoking Irish man, with crazy hair and big glasses. He told us all these crazy stories like how he smuggled weed into the Sudan by putting it into shampoo bottles. Or when he was on a train in Peru that decapitated a woman. He told us that he got off the train and took photos of a dog nibbling on her head and arm and how he now puts them in slide shows to frighten his friends. What cool guy, I hope I'm like that when I'm his age.

Anyway the train started up again and we said farewell to our new friend. We met up with Erica and Nikki and went to the Katoomba where we hung around for a bit, but we didn't stay for long because all the stalls had closed by that stage. Nick and I bought some grog (Nick got himself and the others a bottle of bourbon and I had a 6 pack of beer) before we all headed back to Ericas house to watch cheap horror movies and get trashed!

Within half an hour of watching the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake we were all way too drunk to take any notice of the movie and instead played a series of fun games such as: suck and blow, spin the bottle and best of all the newly created strip suck and blow. 

After the games  Harley dressed in nikkis clothes (something he can't remember) , wearing her sports bra (stuffing socks undernath), her skirt and her tweetie bird top. It was a very disturbing sight which led us all to the conclusion that Harley is a reverse Miriam, However we got some great photos which we can use to blackmail him in the future.

After the game, some dumbass (Probably Nick) decided to go for an undie-run outside. This would have been fine any other time, but it was around zero degrees and was snowing. I was the smart one and chose to stay inside semi-passed out and wrapped up in blankets. Harley proved himself to be even stupider then the rest of us by knocking over and killing a 20 year old plant that belonged to Erica's great grandmother. And that is yet another reason why we all consider harley to be a genius.

Anyway I passed out and had some really weird fucked up dreams, the one I remember best was where I  met Slash (Guitarist from Guns N' Roses) backstage after his concert had finished. He shook my hand, and even better gave me a stack of signed pictures of himself. I became as giddy as a school girl.

I woke up in the morning without a hangover, but it was still fucking freezing despite the amount of blankets I had over me. Harley woke up and didnt remember anything about his actions during the previous night. Nick and I just cracked up laughing.

All in all it wasnt a bad night, we got drunk and passed out in snow-conditions. Not bad at all.

"event","Well I'm updating, but not because my house got power back, nope that's still out (poor guys).  I'm in NY and Jenna happens to have one of those portable computer things! WOWWW with a wireless connection.  you're probably wondering though, if I'm in NY, why am I sitting on the computer.  

this is the weirdest thing I've ever experienced.  During their lunch hour, I saw like... 10 people from my old school.. (basically my entire grade).  Kids I haven't seen in 4 years.  I mean, sure I've seen Josh since I moved, but everyone else (aside from a glance from the last time i visited) I haven't seen really.  Casey for instance...omg weirdest thing ever... I couldn't believe it.  They all like flocked in a sense says my brother.  So here's all these kids I grew up with, from the time I was like 4 until i was maybe 11.  People I've totally lost touch with but used to see every day.  I'm walking around this town and many things are the same, even though my memory is a bit jogged.  It's eerie, and I merely feel unwelcome.  I almost want to pick up where I was before I got here, not really talking to any of them and just leave.. and never have to deal with it again.  It's really awkward and really crazy... completely surreal.

as for the hurricane (the previous not the damn freakin' next one).  it was ok.. not too much damage.  lost a tree or 2, one down on our powerline.  No power since Friday... it was crazy.  We had many people in our small house, including: my parents, josh, jamin, sarah, myself, charlie, zach, eric, dj, and ashley.  Holy MANY people with a complete lack of fresh air during that hurricane.  Eric was tweekin out.  We all woke up in the middle of the night and after he was awake for like 45 minutes he was breaking out in like hives begging for fresh air and a ciggarette.  It was absolutely rediculous.  Much puking on their parts (4 of them, completely out of the norm).  It wasn't bad though.  I've gotten pretty mellow, so I was never really freaking out despite the lack of oxygen (though my head did start to spin by the end of one night, wow that was awful), space, hygene.. so on.. the hurricane was neat.. strong, FREEZING wind.  Eric and zach went out in the strongest part, driving I mean.. idiots..

so now I went from basically living with the boy for 5 days to not seeing him at all... it's extremely weird.

everything is weird right now.  feels like life has stopped in it's tracks.

but as for why I'm not out enjoying myself in this booming town (sarcasim).  the 4 of us (josh, me, eric, and colette) all fell asleep (long drive).  I woke up, walked around for a bit.  and then came back in.  everyone i know is a soccer practice right now.  i may go crash it in a bit.

entirely too long... bye.  be safe."

reassured today. so far everything is good, nearly earily good.  3 weeks today and neither of us are fickle, we actually both seem pretty happy.. but being that I dont want to screw that up with my words, I'll shut up. fact is: for today, it was good.  who knows what tomorrow will bring, but today it's good.  still trips me out that I've had this boyfriend for three weeks.

freakin' this hurricane, I wasn't too worried, you know, haven't been through a hurricane ever so it didn't or doesn't seem to real.. and now I'm reading all these live journals, and talking to people taht are close to me that HAVE been through hurricanes.  everyone leaving, and saying be safe and shit... I'm freaking out.  I dont want to stay here and just watch everything fall to peices.  but even if I did leave, the closest people in my life won't leave.  ""the surf will be so perfect after it passes.  and I dont care if I die, I'll be wasted anyway.""  even if I was gone, I'd be so scared that their dumbasses weren't ok.  I just try not to think about it, but then I feel like I'm not giving it the credit and thought it actually does deserve, you can't just ignor everything and if this is as severe as they're planning for it to be...you really wouldn't be able to ignor it.

aside from that, adding to edgy-ness.. sort've an awkard night.  it started off good.  really good.  I was just having a really good time.  then I said something that was way more offensive then I ever ment to be (oblivious not spiteful) and whoa holy freakin mood swing.  then it fell back into ok.. but a different sort've mood.  before it was super funny and fun, and then it was just sort've quite and close.. and it took a while for everything to seem comfortable again.  then, eventhough it got good again, the end was sort've awkward... tried to pass it off like it wasn't, but I got the feeling that it was.  and being that I know how I am, I know that just little things can knock your head out of it.. it's just such a freaky situation, with so many different angles playing into it, from every damn side.  and though it was working more from one side earlier, there's been a dramatic switch which won't subside until I see it all in action again the next day, all the same as usual.  but I'm affraid it wont be. not my main concern though.  main concern is this huge freakin hurricane coming right at us."

we had a good party, or atleast I think so and that's what counts right?

but serious, I was super bummed about all the seniors leaving, I thought our entire section unity and all that crap would just go out the door and we'd lose all of our spunk and such.  but now they're gone, and yea we may not be the section that everyone thinks is the funniest or anything anymore but I feel bunches closer to everyone in that section.  it's not like a couple guys being the center of attention all the time and putting everyone else down to get a good laugh (eventhough they really were good laughs).  I really enjoy everyone in our section, it's great.  gives a girl that warm fuzzy feeling in side that she's always searching for.  

our night included:
-everyone swimming (except tim and I) and being super crazy
-derek, osiel, and javier backing away from me like I had the plague
-the boys breaking one of those light bulbs trying to get tim's other shoe off
-an INTENSE tornado warning
-some crazy word game for hours (including ""prophylactic"" which amanda's mom was trying to see if she could get any of us to guess.  she assumed I'd be able to get it, which was at first a super low blow, ESPECIALLY because I'd never met her before) but then she said it was because I seemed to be the smartest of the bunch, yess...)
-great, arcade style, q*bert (hell yea)
-javi sniffing my hair while I was playing q*bert
-a toilet running into the hallway, me stepping in the water, and proceeding to put my feet on random people :)
-mucho more

"event","when you can't seem to find any music to fit your mood.  everything hits you the wrong way, and every thought is seemingly dissatisfying.  it'd be easy if I could just have you tell me where I take the wrong turn in my thought process, and I could do the same for you, slap hands, and we'd be done..on our ways.  and on these ways, the cheery music WOULD fit our mood, and we'd go off smiling.. scary thing is after we've exchanged these clues that are suposed to fix everything, we may not know more, but rather ignor more.  because, as the saying goes, ignorance is bliss, and aint that the truth.

go ahead.  try to be a little more optimistic.  ""be optimistic, dont get grumpy, when the road gets bumpy just smile smile smile""  ignor those bumps buddy.  and try to remember that despite how barren and ugly the road is, your exit will come.  

OH THE ANALOGIES!  I wish I could show my mood throughout this entry.  I dont think I like it... ""it"" representing this entry.  sorry guys."

I can see it cleary so I know it's there, but I have no way of getting it.  but then I even go as far to question whether it's  just an illusion, and I'm not talking about the glass, just the entire thing all together.  it wouldn't surprise me and would probably disappoint me less...definitely would.

damnit..

"event","""...Her six-year-old son, Alex, was infected with the bug in July of 1993 after eating a tainted hamburger.  His illness began with abdominal cramps that seemed as severe as labor pains.  It progressed to diarrhea that filled a hospital toilet with blood.  Doctors frantically tried to save Alex's life, drilling holes in his skill to relieve pressure, inserting tubes in his chest to keep him breathing, as the Shiga toxins destroyed internal organs.  ""I would have done anything to save my son's life,"" Donley says. ""I would have run in front of a bus to save Alex.""  Instead, she stood and watched helplessly as he called out for her, terrified and in pain.  He became ill on a Tuesday night, the night after his mother's birthday, and was dead by Sunday afternoon.  Toward the end, Alex suffered hallucinations and dementia, no longer recognizing his mother or father.  Portions of his brain had been liquefied. ""The sheer brutality of his death was horrifying,"" Donley says."""

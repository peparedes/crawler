"event","i had such a wonderful day today. i had exams which were not that bad... and then i spent my afternoon with two of my favorite people in the UNIVERSE.... laura and annie! we watched superstar and ate and then we did the best thing i could ever have done... we walked around my neighborhood and took pictures. it was much needed, seeing as how we have like NO pictures of each other... and we got some amazing shots. i think photography would make a truly fabulous career. the three of us could go into a business together! no but seriously... we all took amazing photos whether we were in front of the camera or behind the camera and it was sooo much fun.  i didn't even care that i was hotter than hot and sweating like a man... i won't go into that though muahahaha
oh man i wish i could paste some pictures in here because they are amazing.  one of my favorites is one of me and annie with her hand on my tushie... yes i just said my tushie... and i like the ones of me in the yard waste can and laura in there too... and the one of me and laura leaping down the block... and pretty much ALL of them are absolutely gorgeous pictures.  alex has to come over and look at them. he said it was just too cute that we were like taking pictures for no reason all afternoon. 
i also realized like 10 minutes ago that i got a little bit of sun walking around all day... mostly just like on my chest though. hahaha
well i'm gonna go look at the pictures some more and try to figure out how to get them all onto a cd for the girlies.
i am definitely a HUGE fan of life in general right now.
i love my friends. i love my family. i love it outside. i pretty much just love life. for serious.

"event","why do some people make it their life's goal to be ass holes? i mean, i hate being in this position, watching certain people just slowly suck all the sanity out of my friends.  it's not fair... there is absolutely no reason this should happen... to anyone... and especially to people as great as the one(s) it does happen to.  GOD i don't even know what to say about it... except that i wish i could just give a big FUCK YOU to the person/people that causes this kind of pain... i mean, maybe it is unintentional, but if it is, then please realize it, then get some balls and fucking fix it...

i hate how i can't be too specific in here. i feel like this is one of those damn advice columns where people write in, but then choose different names for everyone and then give themselves some dumb nickname like ""afraid in arizona"" or ""pregnant teen in pittsburgh.""  gaaahhhh

the worst part is, i wish i could do something about this, but ik i can't do anything of significance.  this pretty much sucks ass.  
you know what? fuck it. fuck it all

"event","well, today has been rather interesting... well, i take that back. it was boring. painfully boring. i'm still in a funk, and i don't know how to get myself out. i need some people who aren't here right now and i need everything to be okay. 
i did just talk to nora though, and i haven't talked to her since like the end of last summer. i have missed her a lot, and i wish she still went to our school. i feel awful for having lost touch with such an amazing person. let's just hope i don't lose touch with her again. that would be very sad.
hillary also came back today, which was MUCH needed. i did not even realize how much i needed her there to talk to until i just didn't have her there for a week. 

i wish everything would just... work itself out. i don't want to have to use any of my energy to work out stupid shit that shouldn't even be a problem in the first place. i wish i could just talk to somebody for as long as i needed whenever i needed about all the stuff that is bugging me. however, i would feel bad for boring them to death, plus i don't really feel ready to talk to a lot of people. and the other problem is: i don't know if i really KNOW what is going on with me, why i am in such a funk, why i am feeling so bummed. i need to figure it out for myself before telling everyone about it i guess. but how do i do that? god, why can't i figure anything out for myself? i feel so helpless...

well... i'm just going to go contemplate things for a while now... this should be just peachy...
maybe tomorrow will be a better day.

"event","aight. so today was not the most fun i've ever had. was i expecting it to be? hell no. of course not. i mean, sometimes i don't act like a genious, per say, but i'm not THAT dumb.  i'll try to look at the brightside... it was my last day w/ mrs. barrington - she's not coming back ever again - and band was super fun cuz adam cracks me up! and i still think it's funny that adam is where jacob got his whole ""you're fat"" thing... i don't feel like explaining that last statement, so if you don't already know and you wanna, just ask me... but yeah... 
then me and annie did have a kickass conversation when we were walking home... i love how we always seem to be on the same page. i'm so sad that she goes to door county every summer all the time.... but hey! when my family goes to door county in august for a couple weeks, i think alex is coming with, so if she hasn't met him by then, she will when i call her from our campsite and ask her to take me clubbin'! WOOPITY POOP!
i'm so anxious for summer to come... but at the same time it is really really sad.  i mean, all the kickass seniors are leaving before we get a chance to know some of them... i'm going to miss some of them soooo much.  i might just cry, especially when sarah schwid leaves for drake... :(
ok... so much for looking on the bright side i guess.
oh and i am also looking forward to when c.c. comes home, because, although i don't know him at all, i need the regular, not cranky laura back. thursday, please get here soon.

i need rest. not really physical rest though... i am not that tired. what i need is mental and emotional rest. and i am not gonna get it from this damn computer journal thing. so i'm about to cut this entry short...

~sara~
oh yeah... HILLARY COMES HOME TOMORROW!!! THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO!!!"

"event","i'm in such a weird mood... all sorts of different thoughts are racing through my brain and i can't concentrate on to kill a mockingbird for more than five minutes at a time.
first off, i was just informed that this one person never wants to see me or laura ever again. i don't know why but i feel awful. like, i didn't want him to like me, but i never intended for him to hate me like this. i feel bad for fighting with him so much. but idk whether or not to ""patch things up"" because idk... idk if i can handle it.  

i think i am really in need of the company of a male right now. hahaha
no but seriously... i need a guy. just someone to be there for me, who i can talk to and who will hug me when i need it... i mean, hugs from friends like annie and laura and hilly are wonderful, but hugs are different coming from a guy you really like. and i need one of THOSE hugs now. those hugs that just make you feel incredibly safe and calm. 

blah. i apologize for rambling... but my brain is in rambling mode right now. i can't think straight. 

i'll stop myself before i start rambling again.

"event","oh boy... i have had a fun day.  i woke up at like 11:45... caught up on some much-needed sleep. then i made myself some really good pancakes for breakfast/lunch... and then, with not too much coaxing, i got my fabulous mother to take me to gurnee mills so i could get a bunch of new clothes at h&m... i got sooo much fun stuff plus a swimsuit that is really cute. then there was this really cute guy who worked at the place we went to for lunch. and then on the way home, we were like blasting the music and we came to a toll booth (cuz ppl in illinois suck like that and make you pay just to drive on the freeway)and the toll booth guy was like dancing to our music... and he was like ""thank you, and you mighty fine ladies have a lovely evening!"" 
that definitely cracked me up... my mom was like ""well, there's a man who loves his job, maybe a little too much."" and then as we drove along we saw this lady and she was the passenger in the car and she was driving w/ her husband and her kid and as she talked to them, she was TOTALLY picking her nose... and they thought nothing of it. like... a fully grown woman... just digging in her nose. who does that?!? 
people are fascinating - truly and utterly fascinating.

i really want to dance with someone right now... just dance all night
meh... oh well i'm all alone

"event","alright, so today was totally bizarre... in spanish, ms. dardis took mikey's ipod away from patrick and she didn't have any pockets, so instead of like putting it away somewhere else, she put it... IN HER PANTS! i am not even kidding... she didn't even like think twice about it... just shoved it down her pants... it was sooo weird.
then on my way home, i got something in my eye - i still don't know what. so i'm walkin along w/ this foreign object in my eye, and it hurts like a mother, and i can't really see right, and laura's laughing at me (i don't blame her - i looked retarded) and i don't even know what is in there. laura kept telling me not to touch my eye, but what can i say? i am like a five year old. i kept touching it and making it worse.  so i went to laura's house for a while to try and get it out - didn't work, but what the hell.  and then i had to walk all the way home half blind. ik ik i'm being a bit dramatic when it comes to the half blind part but oh well. live with it.  and then i saw spencer on his moped (which, yes, is red. i saw that much) and he like drove it on the sidewalk and informed me, among other things, that he had thrown up today.  thank you, spencer, thank you for that lovely thought.
oh and then the subject on the top... i'll be your waterwings? i just found all the lyrics to this song. and it's called brand new colony - it's by the postal service and it is amazing.  i love it. you most likely saw some of the lyrics in my info, but i'm gonna write them here again anyway:

i'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning in an open tab when your judgment's on the brink.
i'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite albums back as you're lying there drifting off to sleep...
i'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you: you won't have to strain to look into my eyes.
i'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped straight to the throat with the collar up so you won't catch cold...

that's not all of them, but i like that part of the song.  i think everyone should have waterwings... you know, someone who cares enough about them to try to be everything they need. 

yeah. that would be nice...

"event","wow... i was definitely thinking that this thing would be stupid... and i still kind of think it is. but i need somewhere to put down my thoughts... and this is convenient enough. so what the hell, right?
so first of all, i can't wait for summer to come. i need it sooo bad. and second of all, since this is memorial day weekend, i really really want to go camping. i just need to get away for the weekend and like go hiking all the time or something. anyone with me...?
hmmm well if not i suppose i shall just have to go all by my lonesome... and then there is a chance that i could get eaten by a bear... or like killed by a moose or something... and we wouldn't want that now would we?
i really need to talk to this certain person right now... because the other day when i talked to him, he made me feel really good.  i miss him.  and when i talked to him, i felt like i mattered. i like that feeling.

i'm just gonna leave it at that i guess,

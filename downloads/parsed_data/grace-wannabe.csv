"event","I had a wonderful Christmas! Despite being sick, that is. Christmas eve I wasn't feeling right but would never admit it, then that night I was burning up with a fever of 104. But I told everyone not to tell Joe while his parents were here because I wanted him to sleep over. So he did, and knew I was sick. And now he's sick. But in the morning I got all my Christmas presents and I love them all!
My parents gave me the Arrested Development DVDs season one and two, Stewie Griffin: the Untold Story, a fondue set, a thing where I can play my iPod through my car, a chenille blanket, DSW gift cards, Old Navy gift cards, an Entertainment book, and Charlie Brown's gift certif for Joe and me. And probably other things I can't think of. Sara got me a pink corset because she is awesome and it's hotttt. My brother and his wife gave me a bag with my initials on it. Bobbie and Norma gave me stationery and a pink suede jacket.
AND Joe. He got my a diamond heart necklace, diamond earring, and a fur coat with a matching fur scarf and fur purse! I love it! It was a great present and he loved his Flyers tickets and wallet and handheld Sudoku games, but he won Christmas.

So it was a great Christmas and I love my presents. I'm just scared of PETA people harassing me and throwing shit on my coat. But if that happens I will sue their asses. I can wear whatever I want people. Haha ok bye."

"event","This weekend was a lot of fun. Well besides Saturday morning. Friday was a snow day so all my classes were cancelled and I slept in. Later Jenna and I went to Ruby Tuesday's so her boyfriend could serve us then we went to the mall. I'm almost finished my presents for everyone, just a few gift certificates and things to buy. I'm keeping track of what I've gotten everyone and how much I paid. I total it up and SHIT. I've spent a lot of money already. Oh well I have it all covered in my savings account. I go a little overboard but oh well the people I'm spending lots on deserve it. 

Saturday morning I worked so that sucked. But I'll never have to work a Saturday morning like that again if I don't want to. I went home and we picked out our Christmas tree (actually I picked it out cause I rule). Had dinner, picked up Joe, and we stopped at Bobbie's new place so Joe and my dad could help move and hang some stuff. Went back to our house and Sara and I decorated the Christmas tree while Joe did Sudokus

The next morning we all got up early and headed to NYC. We took the ferry over and went straight to a very early dinner at Pig 'n Whistle Pub. It was pretty good, I had shepherd's pie. Then we went to see ""Fiddler on the Roof"". Harvey Fierstein was really good in it, just played Tevye much different than Topol did in the movie version which I love. Rosie O'Donnell was a little boring as Golde I think. I never really liked Rosie O'Donnell because I always thought she was just so annoying and obnoxious. But after the show she was outside signing autographs and talking to everything and it totally changed my opinion of her. She was so nice and spoke to everyone and asked questions. Norma was in a wheelchair and Rosie came around the barrier to speak to her and we got pictures with her and autographs. It was fun. Then we went to Rockafeller center and it was so cute I love it and I loved that Joe was there with me. Cute pictures to come. We headed over to Little Italy for dessert; it was sooo good! 

By the time we got back to the house it was so late so Joe and I stayed at my house. I studied and slept then headed back this morning. I sucked at my quiz which upsets me because I studied hard for that. AND I lost my cell phone. I have no idea where it is. I've been studying all day for my Special Ed final on Wednesday and I just want this week to be over so bad. Ok I need to go eat some food. Bye."

"event","It is fucking 11:44 PM on a MONDAY night! And stupid assholes are outside my fucking door yelling about some stupid shit. In an apartment nearby there must be a party going on because there are fucking drunk bitches screaming past my apartment. Someone is playing the fucking drums so loud and it's the same damn fucking beat over and over. This asshole is outside right now either on his phone or talking to himself in his really horribly annoying drunk voice talking real loud about something. If I close my fucking window I overheat. 

This goes beyond me missing Joe. I can't fucking stand living around such assholes. It's one thing to party and be loud this late on the weekend. But it's FUCKING MONDAY. This happens all the time during the week. I'm sorry but I'm not a stupid waste of a life that drinks every fucking night of the week. I have shit to get done and I have to wake up fucking early. And I don't need to hear anyone's shitty drum playing or stupid dumb drunk bitches screaming.

I don't care about living in West Chester. I can deal with being away from my family and Joe during the week. I just need to fucking move somewhere that is not populated by stupid asshole drunken college students. Because this shit is getting fucking ridiculous."

"event","When I filled out that survey, I was in the middle of an insomnia spell. I was bed-hopping, because my bedroom is Norma's for a couple more days. I could just not get comfortable in my sister's or parent's bed. I ended up getting about 4.5 hours of sleep Friday night because I woke up at 830 to go to Philly with Meghan! We went to Kristin's, got breakfast and materials for our costume. It was a lot of fun, too bad it was miserable outside.
I was supposed to go home to pick up Joe so he could help us unpack Bobbie's Pod. Well the Pod hadn't been delivered. It still hasn't been delivered. It's supposed to now be here on Tuesday, which sucks because Joe has work and all my other guy friends either have work or classes. Anyway, I didn't have anywhere to sleep again, so I slept at Joe's. He took me out to dinner to Adelphia's. I've never been there, and I really liked it. I had tilapia. Then we couldn't find each other. Long story. Then we went to Bill and Nicky's to play Mario Party. It was fun I haven't seen them in a while I miss them. Then back to Joe's and I crashed out. 

I came back to school and put my Halloween costume together. I'm being a Las Vegas showgirl. I just have to shorten the top and make the head piece. It's gonna be fun, can't wait for Kristin's party! We'll be where we're wanted. HAHA"

"event","It's been quite a while since I updated on here. I usually just update on myspace, so this is for all you people that click on my livejournal link. I know who you are. 

Things have been normal. Back at school so that means during the week my schedule consists of just going to class and going to work. Working at Curves again, although I'm considering working at a day care next semester. We'll see though, next semester is looking scary as far as classes go. I'm in my minor, and every Thursday I go to field work. It's not bad at all I'm liking it so far. 

Everything is great with Joe. He just won $500 on a $2 scratch-off. He bought me a lot of jewelry lol. A beautiful sapphire ring that I'm in love with, earrings (I thought I lost one at the restaurant for Meghan's Bday Bash, but I found it in my room last night yippeee!) And a Jewish charm bracelet. He needs to stop. Haha. As much as I like that he's buying me pretty shiny things, I want him to save his money. He's been working hard and deserves to save it. 

This past Saturday we went to Philly to a Moroccan restaurant for Meghan's birthday. It was so much fun and the food was excellent. It was a good group so we had a great time. They had a belly dancer come out and she tries to get people to dance and no one else in our group did so I said fuck it and went up, finally. It was pretty fun and now I am obsessed with learning how to belly dance. Oh yea. And we smoked a hookah and it was yummy. For pictures of the craziness, go to http://community.webshots.com/user/jewishslut85

"event","Time for an update. Work is going great, I love the kids. With the exception for a few at least. Or just when they tattle or don't listen. But it's bearable and I know they just love Miss Rachel! Class is almost over, I have Tuesday then Wednesday is the final. 9 days until Arizona and I cannot wait. I'll miss Joe but I know we're going to have a great time. 

Today Joe and I went to Wildwood. Beforehand we stopped by the piercing place in Franklinville and I got my rook pierced. Wee! It didn't hurt that bad and I love how it looks. We got to Wildwood, walked the boards, played some games, went on the Ferris Wheel. I did the ""guess your age"" game and won, because the guy thought I was 27!! Come the fuck on, man. There is no way I look 27. Joe said it's probably because I was with him, but really, I don't think he looks 26. Oh well, I guess it's better than him thinking I was 14 or something, and I won a stuffed seahorse. It was a lot of fun but hot down there. Came back to Gboro and we got some dinner at the diner. Now I'm home and beat as hell.


I did something I probably shouldn't have done and I am a bit worried even though people tell me not to be but you all know how I am and I'm going to worry anyway but I guess I'll just have to wait until tomorrow. 

Yea if that didn't make sense to you don't worry about it."

"event","I find that I don't have a lot of time to update. I really don't have time to be online at all. So when I get these nights where I'm just hanging out at home I'll take some time out to write.

My dad gets home from Korea on Tuesday. I can't wait to see him I miss him and I just want him to get home safely. My brother and sister in law are here and everything is going well so thats good. I started my new job 2 weeks ago and I absolutely love it. The kids are great (for the most part) the thing that annoys me the most about it is when they tattle. That's just the worst. But I can deal with it. Tuesdays are Bellmawr Lake, Wednesdays are field trips, and Thursdays we go rollerskating!! It's fun so hopefully I'll continue to enjoy it for the rest of the summer. So after work I try to get home and try to get back to the Y to work out. THEN I go to class. I'm glad I'm keeping myself busy during the week, because then the weekends get here sooner and I can see Joe. I can't wait until my class is over though because then I'll be able to see him during the week too, hopefully.

I've been looking at WCU people's away messages and they're saying how they miss school and everything. I don't really. I don't want summer to end at all. I mean I'm looking forward to having the apartment and everything but I always get so worried about what's going to happen during the school year. Also I guess it's because I have Joe and he's in Glassboro and I can only see him on weekends it's real tough. So I don't want to go back because I miss him too much and I'm constantly worried that I'm not going to get to see him on weekends. Ah, I'm starting to ramble. 

Ok I'm going to sleep. Oh yea and I got my haircut short (a little above shoulder length) and I love it.

PS I miss my lover. And by lover I'm talking about Miss Meghan Carole Sharp"

"event","There's been quite a lot going on in my life at the moment that I figured I'd update. Especially since I'm waking up early to work out and should really be in bed right now, because that's how I do. Anyway, let's try to break it all down quickly...

-I went to the Bob Dylan & Willie Nelson concert on Thursday with my dad and sister. It was our Father's Day present for him since he left for China on Father's Day (yesterday- and I'll get to that later) It was a great time, especially once the rain let up. I was surprised to have enjoyed Willie Nelson so much, considering I'm not at all a country fan. But he did some songs I recognized and puts on a good show. My absolute favorite was his rendition of ""Me and Bobby McGee"". It's one of my favorite Janis songs and he made it his own which was great. Bob Dylan was good, but I have to say I was a little disappointed in his performance. I guess that's just because I listen to his older stuff from the 60's, you know that time when you could understand what he was singing? It's a shame though because he is such a great songwriter, I'll have to get my hands on his newer stuff and decipher the lyrics. While he was on we went down onto the field to get a little closer. That was tough and we were surrounded by a bunch of drunken weird people. ""Damn hippies"" as Joe would say. 

-So as I said before, my dad left for China and Korea yesterday. That means for the next 3 weeks or so until he gets back I'm going to be all kinds of worried. ALSO, my brother is coming home. I often get people being totally surprised that I have a brother because he's never around so no one really knows about him. But yes, I do, his name is Hillel, Hilly we call him. He's my half-brother, my dad's son and he's much older than me. He was in the army and stationed in Korea years ago. Once he got out of the army he stayed because he liked it so much and taught English. He got married to a girl from Uzbekistan, and they moved to Japan. So now they're coming to the US to settle down here. They're coming in about a week and my dad will still be away. We haven't seen Hilly in 6 years and we've never met his wife, Natasha. It will definitely be an experience. I think it'll be interesting especially because the last time he saw me I was 14. Now I'm 20  with a boyfriend 6 years older than me and I just think it might take him some time to realize that it's been so long. Or something like that. 

-I got a new job and I'll soon be saying ""fuck you!"" to Commerce Bank forever!! Let's just hope I'm not stuck there for a full 2 weeks. I want to start my new job asap. I'll be working at A + Academy in Voorhees for their summer day program. I'll be getting more hours than Commerce but paid less but it works out because I hate working at Commerce. I could get into the whole chain of events but I'm really getting tired and want to wrap this up soon, maybe. Anyway, I went to my new job today to pick up paperwork and found out I can start this Monday. I told Commerce I have to start there this Thursday, though, because I just want to have some time to chill. It's not like I'm ever going to go back there. I'm so excited to start at A +. It should be a lot of fun. Tuesdays we go to Bellmawr Lake and Wednesdays we go on field trips. The week I start we're taking a Duck tour in Philly. I just can't wait to start working with kids.

Okay. I started writing this last night, and now when I try to pick up where I left off I'm having a hard time. It took me a while to finish that last paragraph. I'm so tired. Goodnight.

Oh yea and never tell your boyfriend to stop talking for the rest of the night. Especially if your boyfriend is anything like mine, cause he really will stop. And it's great for a while, but not when you want to hear him say goodnight to you. Booo."

"event","I just called my mom on her cell phone as I was standing outside of my house at 1:15 in the morning because there were two massive spiders on the door and I needed her to come open it. I'm severely arachnophobic. I feel really bad about making her come down to let me in. It's already caused me to lose sleep, though because now I feel so skeevy thinking about spiders. If she didn't let me in I would have slept in my car and I'm not even joking. I have problems.

Anyway, I was starting to get a little upset the past few days. Joe and I have schedules that just aren't ideal as far as compatibility goes. The one day a week he has off I'm either at work or class. Even if he gets done early during the week, most likely I have work or class. Then on Fridays and weekends, when I'm off, he's working all the time. We get to see each other once or twice on the weekends, mostly at night. Therefore, here is a list of things to do at night in South Jersey: diner, mall, movies, coffee shop, billiards. That's it. (And please, if I'm missing something on the list, let me know so Joe and I can add on. I know it's not his fault but the past few days I was just getting frustrated thinking about how we do the same things all the time. I kinda whined about it tonight to him, but we went about our night-Barnes & Noble followed by movies to see ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (good movie I recommend) When I was coming home, though, I realized that we always have fun together. Everytime we go out it's fun, it doesn't matter if we're constantly going to Porky's or the people at Starbuck's know who we are. We have fun because we're just two assholes in love. Wee.

Now it's off to sleep in my probably bug-infested bed."

"event","Tonight Joe and I celebrated our one year anniversary. I can't believe it's been a year. It flew by and I want it all to work out so much. We've been through a lot in one year so if we can make it through what's left of all the shit I think we'll be good to go. He makes me so happy and I've never felt this way before. And I want this feeling to last forever. I'm scared of the word forever though. Just because I don't want to say ""I know it'll last forever"" when who knows what can happen tomorrow. I was reading my journal entries from a year ago, when I first met Joe. It's so funny to look back and remember my first impressions of him. He annoyed me at first and I thought he was really strange. (Of course I still think he's strange but I am too so it's a perfect fit) And he made comments about me being so young, and about not wanting to date a Jewish girl. But then his friend said I should come back to the play the next night and suggested I go with Joe, so we started talking. I didn't even know he was attracted to me until we went outside so he could have a cigarette (he never ended up having one because we were talking so much). And then he came over and kissed me. And the rest is history. :-)

Tonight was perfect. Would have been ultimate if he slept here, but I won't complain. We went to the Moshulu for dinner. It was so nice and the boat is gorgeous. For the first course I had shrimp ceviche (amazing with delicious mango) and for dinner I had seasoned ahi tuna. That was delicious as well. Then for dessert I had mango mousse napoleon. Unbelievable! There wasn't any chocolate in it either but it was still so great. I loved it, I loved everything about dinner. Joe got me flowers and the sweetest card ever. Then we walked around South Street for a while which was fun but my feet started to kill. We came back to my house and rented ""Finding Neverland"". I already saw it but I know Joe really wanted to see it too. It was an amazing night and I can't wait for more amazing nights. I love Joseph Michael Lawrence Joseph Lawler with all of my heart :-)"

"event","I'm bored, so I figured I'd do my little ""reflect on the school year"" update. I was finished real classes on Wednesday, and next week I just have exams. This year flew by just like the one before, and as much as I want school to end, the thought of being out in the real world scares me. Of course, I still have graduate school to get through. But I still can't believe I'm almost a JUNIOR, and thoughts of grad school are in the near future. It's all such a big headache that I wish I was done with it all, but at the same time I don't want to wish my life away. These are the best years after all. 
While this year wasn't as wild and crazy as last year, I enjoyed it. There were different circumstances of course. Freshman year I began school not knowing what to expect and was involved in what I thought was some form of relationship, but was apparently just some joke of a relationship that mysteriously ended. This year I entered school already knowing what the college experience was like and was in a serious (or at the time it was becoming serious) relationship. As far as love lives go, it's obvious this year was better. Hands down no questions about it. <i>(I originally had a lot written in this section about my relationship with Joe, but then I realized our anniversary is coming up and I'll do a special entry for that)</i>:-)

Anyway, there was more to this year than my relationship. Not much, of course, but some. I got a job and had my car on campus. It was great that I could have some sort of freedom and some side cash. But I realized I'm not so good with money all of the time and gave up my credit card. It really sucks to not have it around, but I'm already starting to see my checking account increase when before it would never accumulate because once money was deposited, it was taken right back out to pay for my way-too-high credit card bills. 

I also saw friends change this year. It's been hard to watch them change so much. I'm slipping away from them and it's very sad because I miss the friendships we've had and all the memories. But that's what happens in life. Things change, people change, and we just have to deal with it and move on. I was reading my old journal entries from one to three years ago right around this time. It's just interesting to see how much my outlook has changed as I reach different stages in my life.
So despite shitty classes, lots of work, and not having much of a social life this year, I thought it was a good year and hope that next year will be just as good or better. It has to be, I have an apartment!!"

"event","Not like anyone really cares about what's going on in my life. I understand, I just like to write for the fun of it. Hm, so last time I wrote a lot has happened, I guess.

It's Passover. My school cafeteria doesn't know how to serve kosher for Passover food and I bitched my ass off. Yup, cause I'm a renegade. 
Joe came for Passover seder. We had a huge dinner and it was nice. 

I'm ridden with allergies at the moment, since Saturday. I feel a little better now my nose just hurts from the constant blowing. OYYY.

Classes ended yesterday. Now next week I just have finals Tuesday through Thursday. Then I'm home for the summer! I can't wait.

Yesterday was a busy day.I called out of work, went to classes and packed my car up with a lot of stuff. I still have a lot left at school. Went to Joe's and hung out there for a bit, then he took me to the diner so I could have an omelet. Then to Wal-Mart and back to my house so he could help my dad move furniture. Right now there is no furniture in my living room and I'm sitting on the floor watching the ""Surreal Life"" and writing in this shit. After that, we went to Barnes and Noble and he bought me a drink AND a godiva chocolate bar! Since I couldn't eat any of the delicious looking pastries they had. Then he had to go to a work meeting so I went and got stuff at Kmart then we went to the movies to see ""Hostage"" It was really good, but not something I would be able to watch again because I already know what happens and it wouldn't be as good next time. 

I decided to make dinner tonight. Since we're still observing Passover (excluding my mom) I searched the web and think I found a good recipe thats sort of Italian. Potato gnocchi and turkey meatballs with marinara sauce. So we'll see how it turns out. Wish me luck.

My one year anniversary with Joe is coming up and I have to say, I'm so in love with him."

4. Making out with Joe.

So much fun. I sure hope this summer is good.

"event","i'm in a really pissed off mood right now. i'm trying desperately to find another job so i don't have to return to the hell hole that's known as commerce bank. i want to work somewhere where i don't work weekends, the pay is good, and that i can get experience that is related to my major/minor. commerce bank gives me good hours and the pay is decent. but everything else about it sucks. oh and meghan works there. thats one plus. but honestly, even with meghan working there it would still be shit. no offense to meghan of course, but we'd have different schedules, i know they wouldn't let us sit near each other, and they'd probably treat us like little fucking kids. because i know that's how i've been treated in the past. 

and i'm sick of everyone telling me what a great job it is. if you like it so much go work there yourself. and everyone says well you'll find that anywhere you go. yea well maybe if i enjoyed what i did, going to work somewhere shitty wouldn't be as bad, because i get to do what i like. i want to work with kids, and yea most summer programs probably wouldn't pay me very well, but if it's not a lot less than commerce i'll take it. i don't care. i have to call around to some places tomorrow and see what i can do.

the only problem is, i do need a job. and that will have to mean me going back to commerce if i can't find another job. then there's my worry that i won't be able to get my job back there because either they'll give me shit about meghan working there and meghan being my best friend, or they'll say some shit like i called too late and there's no room left for me to work. then i'll be screwed for money. so it's a dilemma. i hate that place and don't want to go back, but if i can't find someplace else to go i need it as my last resort. 

this whole thing is really making me not look forward to summer. between that and my 10 weeks, 3 times a week of spanish classes from 810-1040 PM is really making me wish i could just quit everything."

"event","Oh my. It's been rough lately, but hopefully getting better. To clear up last my entry, I received a call from Joe when I was on my way to work. His best friend Bill got his arm caught in a lathe at work and it was really bad. He's still in a coma, but apparently he's doing better and he'll come out of it soon hopefully. I'm still so worried. Joe is still real upset too, of course. And I hate seeing him like this. But there's nothing anyone can do but be there for Joe and pray for Bill. On top of that, there was a lot of other bad news that Joe received that day about his friends. I was just so overwhelmed with everything, I'm exhausted from school, and I just want to be home for longer than a weekend. I feel like I can't be there for Joe as much as I should be since I'm stuck at school and can't come home until Fridays. During the week I feel helpless, and even though I can talk to him on the phone I just want to hug him and hold him. I know he understands, it's hard when I'm at school. Hopefully Bill will be okay soon and everything will be better. 

Anyway, I don't know what else to say. I need it to be May."

"event","I'm exhausted. Today was pretty rough, and I was only the receiver of news. I can't even imagine how the people who are directly involved in all of it are dealing with it. There are various events I'm talking about, and I feel so bad for Joe because he's the one getting all this bad news about his friends. All I can do is be there for him and listen, hold him and pray for his friends. He's been there for me when I needed him, especially last summer. I'm just so glad he's in my life to help me get through the rough times, and I'm pretty sure he's thankful for me. So this is what a serious relationship is like. It'll be a year in May. There have been plenty of low points, but this year has been the happiest in a long time, or ever. 

I can't take much more of being awake, so I have to get in bed. Hopefully tomorrow won't be as bad emotionally, but it's still going to be long. Classes nonstop from 11am-7pm. Oh well, I'll deal."

"event","My spring break was great... and had an amazing ending! Last night Kristin was having a party, so Joe and I were gonna go. He got out of work an hour earlier and we got there by 9. Kristin comes down to get us and we walk upstairs, open the door, and....SURPRISE! They threw me a surprise birthday party. I couldn't believe it and I was definitely shocked. I was so glad to see everyone, and definitely surprised and happy to see Jenna and Sherry. AND...it was a lingerie party! Meghan and Kristin picked out a really cute white see-through nightie with matching underwear. Everyone was wearing lingerie and most of the guys were in their boxers. It was so great. Then Joe gives me another birthday present, saying ""did you really think i was just going to give you a bag of yarn?"" honestly I thought that was my prsent, but I thought it was the greatest and sweetest present ever. So then he pulls out a little bag and there's a beautiful, antique looking watch in there. With marquesite (sp)!! He said it's to match the necklace he got me. Oh I love it and I love him. I had such a great time I was so happy. I feel so loved and I know I'm so lucky to have such awesome friends. Big thank you to Meghan and Kristin, and thank you to everyone else that came and made it great! 

But now I'm back at school and I'm sad and have to write a paper and shower."

"event","Things aren't too good right now. Got a little pissed at Joe last night, tried to work it out tonight but ended up leaving the phone conversation with both of us angry. Plans for tomorrow's b-day bashed were cancelled because no one could come. Instead me, Jenna and the boys are going out to dinner then getting drunk in the room. That should be good times. So that's worked out, but the thing with Joe still isn't, and that is what's upsetting me more than anything else. I know we'll work it out, I hope at least. I just feel bad because he's got a lot of shit to deal with, and I don't want to add any more stress to that. But he needs to realize that I'm stressed too. We just need to talk I guess. I knew that not seeing him this weekend would make my week shitty.

"event","So today, thankfully I felt better. Still got some gunk in my throat but other than that I'm good. My family and I went up to NYC for the day. We took the ferry over and went and saw ""The Producers"". It was really good. The guy who played Cameron from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" was one of the leads. There was a lot of Jewish humor, of course. It's Mel Brooks after all. And it should go without saying that my family enjoyed all of it haha. Oh, and there is a Monty Python musical coming out called ""Spamalot"", and it's taken from the Holy Grail. I want to see it so bad. AND, David Hyde Pierce, Hank Azaria, and Tim Curry are all in it! I must go. Let me know if you're interested.

Anyway, it took us a while to find a cab which was a pain in the ass because I could feel my feet start to swell/go numb. We finally got a cab and the driver was actually really nice. We finally get to Lucky Cheng's, thinking we're late, and realize we're the only customers there. That doesn't last long though. Lucky Cheng's, for those who don't know, is a restaurant where the waitstaff is drag queens. They put on shows too. We had our dinner, the drag queens were cool but nothing real exciting happens....then out comes my dessert with a candle in it, and a bunch of them singing happy birthday. I loved it. Then the show begins. The lead lady, Hazel Nuts, sang some songs and at one point got up and danced on top of my dad. It was the funniest thing I've ever seen. The pictures are priceless. Then she did this little contest that each table could try to take part in. She passed around and envelope for tips and apparently whoever put the most in would get to be in this contest. You had to write which person from your table you wanted in the contest. My mom put $10 in and wrote my name down, including that it was my birthday. Then I get called, along with two other women and a guy. They make the guy sit down, and we're standing up there. No one knows what the contest is. Then we find out: a lap dance contest! Now holy shit, I'm standing up here about to give a lap dance to some random Asian stranger, while my family looks on. Um. All eyes on me. Holy shit. All I'm thinking is family Joe family Joe family Joe. It was just so weird. I shook my ass in front of the guy until they told me to stop. My parents took a lot of pictures. I didn't win. If my parents weren't there I would have. Haha. It was quite a lot of fun, but now I'm beat. It's time for sleep.

It better not snow until Monday night, damnit."

"event","This week wasn't too bad. It went by slow, especially considering I spent a lot of the time at Joe's. I went back there yesterday. We went to the mall so I could check out that leather jacket I thought I liked. I started getting excited because it was on sale further for $80! It's black with pink designs on it and everything. Very rocker. However I try it on (it fit perfectly) and I realize that on the back it says ""rocker"". That totally killed it for me. I was quite disappointed because I wanted it to look rocker, and if you have to state that you're rocker, you definitely aren't. That's my theory. I liked it a lot too. Oh well. Anyway, we're at the mall and I buy NOTHING. What's worse is that Joe bought two shirts. And then a book when we got coffee at Barnes & Noble. And I bought nothing. Haha it's so strange and backwards.

Then we went back to his house and watched biographies of serial killers and like 4 episodes of ""Oz"" which could quite possibly be one of my new favorite shows. Then sleep. He made me breakfast in the morning, yummy. So now I'm home. I went shopping with my mom and sister today and I pretty much finished up my outfit for NYC. I'm gonna look like an old school 50's girl hell yes! 

Now I am waiting to hear from Shawn and/or Meghan so we can hang out!"

"event","The past two nights I've slept at Joe's. His parents are in Florida so why not take advantage of some privacy, right? Sunday night I wasn't even planning on sleeping over. But we went to Bill and Nikki's place and played poker and I just ended up sleeping at Joe's because I didn't feel like driving back. I was doing pretty good in poker, I must say. Especially for my first time playing. I lost in the end, but it was close. I only lost $5 so I don't care. Anyway, when we got back to Joe's, we just sat in the living room while he read and I played on my computer. I felt like we were an old married couple and it was really cute. 

So I came back to school, classes, and took a nap around 1145. I woke up at 145 to take my pill, and was just going to lay down for a little longer. When I woke up it was 345. Definitely not good. Then a bunch of us went to Friday's which was a lot of fun, then I drove back to Joe's. He was so tired and asleep when i got there so I tried laying down with him but since I took a fucking 4 hour nap that day I just couldnt handle it. I ended up tossing and turning until 330. I only got about 4 hours of sleep last night. And now I have a day of classes and work. Oy vey. Oh well, it was worth spending time with Joe :-)"

"event","I'm 19, and this year was the first time I ever had a Valentine. I don't think there's anything wrong with being 19 (or any age) and not having one. But this year, Joe is in my life (for 9 months now!) and suddenly I'm stopping myself from giving dirty looks in every store I go into. I've been so used to hating this holiday that it just comes naturally. I do think that it is still quite a hassle. Even with a boyfriend, I spent the last week or two worrying about whether he took off work, if he made the reservations, what the even get him, and so on. I think I'm a self-made pessimist; I wasn't letting myself get my hopes up too much in case something happened. I only get excited until it actually occurs. And this Valentine's Day was definitely something to get excited about.

When I got to Joe's, he gave me a great surprise as I walked in- he got his hair cut! Although I think he always looks good, I love when his hair is short. He looked so sexy. AND he got me a dozen red roses in a beautiful vase. I loved it. So, we headed to Philly, as Joe patiently helped to guide me through city driving and assure me that I was doing fine. Had dinner at The Spaghetti Warehouse which was excellent. It was a really cute restaurant. The shrimp parmigiana was very good, but so filling I couldn't even eat dessert! 
Then we went over to the Franklin Institute where we continued our date. There was a huge event going on this weekend in honor of the 50th anniversary of the giant heart. They had all different activities going on including a gala (but you could only go into the gala if you were over 21. boo) We walked around the museum looking at all the different exhibits, then decided to go see a program called ""Fall in Love Under the Stars"" in the planetarium. But we had time before it started and we went into the gift shop. We were looking through the display case and I saw this beautiful pearl necklace with a markesite (sp?) pendant. I mentioned how I really liked it. Then Joe says lets ask to see how much it costs. I knew it would be too much and I wasn't willing to spend the money on it. It was a lot, or at least too much for me and I didn't even give it a second thought. All of a sudden Joe offers to buy it for me. I wanted it, but I didn't want him to buy it for me, so I insisted that I didn't want him getting it for me. The guy tells us that the store is closing in 3 minutes, so if we should figure out if I want it. I left the store and Joe goes back in and buys it for me. I couldn't believe it and I felt so bad, but very touched at the same time. It's definitely the greatest gift I've ever gotten from a guy. But I'm only wearing it on special occasions.

Okay, so we went to the planetarium to see the show. It was cute but a little boring. Afterward we hung around some more then went to see an IMAX movie. It was a stomp movie that showed music from all cultures. It was really good. Then we left, ending a fabulous night.

The one thing I really regret is that I didn't take any pictures. I wanted to after the IMAX but forgot. It sucks, but hopefully there will be plenty more Valentine's Days spent with my love.

Oh, by the way, sorry to everyone for this incredibly long entry :-)"

I have to go to the doctor tomorrow to see what those flashy things were that I got at Shawn's. Hopefully he doesn't send me to the ER again for tests. It took so long for them to even see me when it was empty in there and I just don't want my mom to have to go through all the worry again. I have stuff to get done tomorrow I don't want that taking up my whole day! haha

So apparently Joe has made reservations. I spent all day at work bitching to the members about how he didn't make them yet. But I came back to find out that he has them now. Seven o'clock, Spaghetti Warehouse, Philly. Then we hop a cab over to the Franklin Institute. It should be a nice Valentines Day. But as usual, I'm not getting my hopes up until we're actually there haha. 

I have a new found obsession- pierogies! (i hope i'm spelling them right?) Anyway, every Thursday they have them at the foodcourt at sykes, and I've been getting them and they are delicious. Ugh I love them, wish they were better for me though.

Now it's time to nap until 330, wake up and study for sign language for a half hour."

"event","This weekend was pretty good. I came home Friday morning, stopping by AC Moore on the way. They have such a huge selection of yarn, and what do I end up getting? The same exact yarn that I've bought at Wal-Mart. Oh well, I like it and I made two scarves and a coin purse this weekend so yea. That night Joe and I went to Barnes & Noble and saw ""Assault on Precinct 13"".  It was really good, even though it wasn't the movie I wanted to see. But oh well. 

Saturday morning I took the train into Philly and went to meet up with my mom and sister. They spent the weekend there with Meghan's mom and sister. We went to breakfast then to the Franklin Institute and Reading Terminal Market for dinner. Then we came back to the hotel and went in the pool and hot tub and steam room.  Came back to the room and watched ""Dodgeball"" and there was this gala kind of thing right outside the hotel the street was closed and hundreds of people dressed in tuxes and gowns were walking from the Academy of Music to the Bellevue. It was interesting.

Anyway, I'm sexually frustrated right now. Hardcore. And I'm pissed because I have off school Tuesday and Wednesday this week and I have to work. And Joe is off on Wednesday and I want to see him so bad but I can't because I have to go into work at 1. I'm in a bad mood now. Ugh."

I really was looking forward to going to Wyatt's too. Oh well, I'm sure there will be a next time. Now Joe doesn't know what time he's working until tomorrow and I really hope he has to go in really early because then I can maybe see him before I go back to school. Unless, of course, I can't even get back to school tomorrow. Maybe I won't even go back until Monday morning. Unless school is cancelled. I don't know, man. I have a feeling I won't get to see Joe this weekend. And for that, I hate snow. 

I knitted a purse today because I had all day to do it. I just finished and I'm in love with it. Hardcore, man. I should open my own business. But first maybe I should learn how to sew better. Ha. 

I'm getting more and more excited about the apartment for next year. I was in Target today, before the snow was ridiculous, and I saw so much cute stuff. I love it all, and it just makes me want to get married and have a house ASAP. Well, for now I'll just stick with the apartment. I can't wait to decorate and have people over for dinner. And parties that are invite-only. None of that open to everyone shit. We party classy.
I also can't wait to be 21. It will just be so much easier with everything.

I'm going to see ""The Producers"" in NYC for my parents' 25th anniversary. My mom just told us today that we're going to go to Lucky Cheng's for dinner. Holy shit, man, I'm in love. Luck Cheng's is a restaurant where the entire waitstaff are drag queens and they put on a show. I can't wait it better be amazing and I better make some friends. 

In other news, I really want to see my boyfriend. I need to spend a long time with him. Like overnight. I just want a hug, man."

So I started back at work yesterday and had work today. I signed two girls up, so that's some commission for me. woohoo. I have to finish eating my soup then write a paper on my philosophy on education. I have no idea what to write, but I am ECSTATIC that I have parents who are both teachers. It helps me a lot.

"event","What a break this turned out to be. I had probably the best Christmas and New Years I could ask for, and when my break started I thought it was going to suck!


I work at Commerce on Monday and then I'm done there until the summer. Hopefully Meghan will get the job so it will make going to work easier, since I can make my schedule same as hers and then we can take breaks together. Tuesday I get my wisdom teeth out and I'm getting nervous about it but it's just because I think too much.

THe past week has been wonderful. Hung out with Heather on Monday and saw ""Spanglish"" which was very good. Tuesday I hung out with Joe and we saw ""Lemony Snicket's"". I liked it but it did seem to drag on a bit. Wednesday Joe took me shopping at Gadzook's as part of my Christmas present and I loved it. I got a lot of clothes. Then we met up with his friend Bill and his girlfriend Nicky and went to shoot pool. Thursday I hung out with Erica and saw ""Ocean's 12"" again. Love it, hot Brad.

Last night was by far the best New Years I've ever had. Joe and I took the train over to Philly to Kristin's apartment and partied with my wonderful friends. When it was almost midnight we walked the block to Penn's Landing to watch the fireworks. It was so romantic I loved every minute of it. Then went back to the apartment, had more crazy fun times and fell asleep. I love him so much it makes me sick. And I'm so glad I could spend that night with him and Meghan and Kristin and their boys, because we all deserve happiness. 

Tonight I went to my aunt's in Philly. Now it's almost 8 and I am so tired I could plotz."

I've been back at Commerce for a week. I hate waking up early but besides that, I'm not letting that place bother me anymore therefore I don't mind it as much. Plus I only have a week and a day left there, then I have my surgery. 

I didn't get to see Joe much this week, but we had a great weekend together. He bought me thoughtful and wonderful presents and is taking me shopping sometime this week. But more importantly, I'll get to see him more than once this week! Yay for getting a work schedule that better coincides with mine. 

Christmas was really  nice. I love spending the time with my family and friends and this year Joe.

"event","Ok, I was really looking forward to this break as a chance to relax somewhat and spend time to hang out with friends, and mainly I was happy because I would have a chance to spend more time with Joe. Well, I'm working 8:30-5 Mondays through Thursdays the first two weeks of break to make up for the days I'll miss the third (and final week) of break while I'm having my wisdom teeth removed. Okay, so relaxing, not so much. Then tonight, I hung out with Joe after he got done work only to find that all of next week he's working, right up until Christmas. Then I thought maybe he'll be working good hours that coincide with my schedule. Oh what a foolish thought. No, his hours are from like 4-10:30 or 1:30-10:30. He's tired a sore after working and tonight I spent maybe an hour with him. And this break that I was so excited for is now messed up a great deal. I'm still happy to be seeing my friends of course, but it's so hard because I love Joe so much and it feels like I'm going to be seeing him LESS over break than when I'm at school. I drove the whole way home crying because of it, and because I then realized how horrible I feel for crying over this. There are so many people out there who have had loved ones pass away and can never get to spend time with them. But here I am, crying because I can't spend time with him more than an hour or so a day. It's just terrible, and I feel like I have a right to be sad and disappointed, but at the same time I feel selfish for feeling that way. 


In other news, I had a grand old time with Meghan Sharp today, She picked me up from my mom's school (I was helping her kids make gingerbread houses) and we headed to Rutgers, got some things done there, stopped by to see Joe Szabo, and ended up giving him a ride home. It was good seeing him again, I love talking about stupid people with him and Meghan, it's fun. Finished my scarf (I love it!) and we went to Tandoori Palace for my dad's birthday. Came back, opened presents, cake, Wal-Mart run, dyed Meghan's hair, and then went to Joe's. And then the above passage began..."

I'm a little nervous about getting general anesthesia, but I know I'll be okay. I've had it before years ago, but now I'm thinking about it more. It's creepy how one minute they're telling you to count down from 10, and the next thing you know you're waking up, sometimes puking. Yum, can't wait. I'm going to take Gina's advice and drink pineapple juice the days beforehand, we'll see if it works for me to stop swelling. Anyway, the rest of the day I took my sister to get her hair done and get her ready for the Hop. She looked so pretty and grown up. We took her to her date's house, and got pictures. Dropped them off and ate in Hammonton. Saw people from high school, unfortunately. Came home and just hung out all night.

Saturday I went out with Jen to Wal-Mart, Target, and then to her boyfriend's diner for free food. It was fun, Jen we need to hang out more. Then came home, had dinner, and Jaime helped us decorate the tree. Later I went over to Joe's and we went to see Ocean's Twelve. I liked it a lot. I got Channukah presents from him and his family! His parents got me Channukah fortune cookies, a chocolate Star of David lollipop, and the cutest little stuffed dog wearing a yamulkah. Joe got me a cute sweater with a matching scarf. I love it all. I love him so much. Wee. 

Today I went to Wal-Mart again, and to some other stores for dinner. I'm finished my shopping pretty much. Channukah dinner was nice. Heather came and I was really glad she did. I got a few Channukah presents from the fam. My parents gave me ""Reservoir Dogs"" and $20, my sister gave me nice shower gel, lotion, and bath soak. Nice Channukah."

This is what I have left: 1 more Philosophy class (in 20 minutes), 1 more Speech and Hearing Science class, 3 days of work, 2 finals on Monday (Speech and Hearing Science and Phonetics), Spanish final on Tuesday, and Philosophy final on Thursday. It's nice I have a free day on Wednesday, which will probably be spent in my pajamas knitting and reading/studying for philosophy. And packing my car up. Thursday after the final I have to work, but then I will be done work and classes until January 10th. Of course, I am going to work at Commerce over break, but it really shouldn't be that bad. I just want to be home for those 3 weeks. I can't wait.

Lately I've been noticing things changing. I thought that some of these things were permanent, and it scares me to think that I have a lot of things in my life that I want FOREVER. And I know that they probably will all change. It's a depressing kind of thought I think. There are certain kind of changes that I like. Changing a room around, changing up a style, and sometimes even changing a daily routine. But I don't want the people in my life to change and it scares me to realize that they will inevitably change, and there's nothing I'll be able to do about it. I know how it goes, it's happened before in my family and I can't say I'm a fan of it. I want to keep everyone that is in my life now forever. I love you, everyone.

"event","So my music collection is changing up. But I like it. I need a record player hard.

This weekend has been good. Very tiring, though. After my bout of insomnia on Friday night, I had to work at Curves from 7-12. It was rough, but I survived. I was happy that I got paid, and this girl Q from the Paoli club came in and we worked out together so it passed the time. After work I went straight back, and slept for 3 hours. It was definitely needed. I went to take a shower only to learn that all of University Hall had NO HOT WATER. I needed a shower badly, so there was nothing left for me to do. It was a horrible experience. I ended up having to straighten my hair because I knew it would look like complete shit if I left it curly. So I came out of the shower alive and actually very awake. Dinner, then recital. I think we did a good job, and I'm thinking about taking chorus next semester again. I'm not sure. Maybe I should have tried out for the chorus Jenna and Mary are going to be in. But I suck, so there's no point.

Afterwards I went with my parents to the new Mexican restaurant in West Chester for a bit. We saw Raab Himself. It looked like he was on a date. Aww he's so cute. I ended up leaving when they were and I was driving behind them for a while. Oh West Chester, I love you. Went to Joe's and we went to see ""After the Sunset"". It was pretty good, not my favorite movie but really not too bad. I just wanted to spend time with Joe. Even though I see him every weekend I just miss him and I wish I could spend more time with him. This is why winter break is needed ASAP.

Today was Ethan's bar mitzvah celebration. It was nice, I'm glad I went. I was literally pushed into their hot cousin Harlin to dance with him. Shh, don't tell Joe. It was harmless, we just talked a bit. He seems nice, quiet though. If he didn't live in New York I would totally set him up with Jenna. I decided to stay home tonight and I'll drive back tomorrow morning for class at 10. Then I can take a real long nap so that's good. Tomorrow begins the last week of real classes for Fall semester.

I took a long nap today and had some coffee before going to the movies. But I'm always tired and coffee never really perks me up for long, so I should have been able to sleep. I was just tossing and turning, something would keep bothering me, I'd be uncomfortable, I was thinking about too many things...No matter how hard I tried I couldn't fall asleep and I'm clueless as to why.

We went to see ""Closer"" tonight. At first it was pretty good, but it just got worse and worse as the movie went on. Four main characters and the same conversations were going on over and over again. What I got out of this movie was that everyone cheats on the person they love, so to just add onto my already paranoid self, I now think Joe is cheating. Okay, so it really didn't get me believing it fully, but it put the thought in my head, as well as whether he really does love me, if he does at all. And maybe thats a reason I can't fucking sleep tonight. I don't know. All I know is that very soon I'll have work and I'm already anticipating a shitty, shitty day."

I think I just had too much fun over that small break, got to sleep in and relax a lot, and it really wasn't enough time at all. It went by too fast that I was just beginning to get used to the whole relaxation thing, but I wasn't sick of it yet. That's just how life is, I guess.

Nothing else going on really. I'm tired and hungry and I have no food in the room. And I'm poor and in incredible debt. Damn credit card. I miss Joe a lot, too. Right now I could really go for a nap, some food, some money, and Joe. That would make my weekend.

"event","Before I go on and on about the stress I'm facing, I'll start off with the nice couple of days I've been having. Thanksgiving was great, I love spending time with family and friends and eating lots of food. Shawn, Meghan, and Don were here so it was fun. After most people left, Shawn and I rented Margaret Cho Revolution and the two of us and Meghan watched it then stayed up late talking. Shawn slept over, and at 5AM I woke up my mom and Bobbie and we went Black Friday shopping!! (Now this is the part that  I love, but is also the frustration that I'm going to be dealing with) I got really good sales at Kohl's. I spent about $100 but I got a lot, and I finished my dad's birthday present, got a lot of my sister's and I'm pretty much finished Joe's present. I ordered him a belt buckle online with a Celtic knot, then at Kohl's I bought him a belt for it, this gaming thing with casino games, a little picture holder thats a s'mores person that says ""i burn for you"", and I'm probably going to give him the Aqua Teen Hunger Force dvd. My mom bought it for him but didn't realize how much it was because she bought him something else. So I'm just going to give it to him. He'll like it I know. We also went to Target, and got home by 7:45 and I slept until 11 or so.
Later I picked up Joe and we met the family at Charlie Brown's. It was really nice, Bobbie and Norma liked him a lot so that's good. He's so sweet. Afterwards we went back to my house and he changed my belly button ring woohoo. And we played Trivial Pursuit. We were on a team and were real close to winning. He's so smart. Then I took him home and couldn't make it to Stacy's because it was too late since Shawn and Meghan were going at 11:30. I'm sorry guys! 
Anyway...as I was driving Joe home I mentioned something about money, then listed all of the different amounts of money I owe for certain things. I have December's rent to pay this week, a security deposit for the apartment next year since we'll probably sign the lease this week, and credit card bills and I just spent $100 in a day. And I don't make that much money at my part-time job. My parents pay for the rent this year, and I know they'll help me out with things but they're strapped for cash too so I feel really bad. It's a problem though. I still have people to buy for too. So as I'm thinking about this driving Joe home I burst into tears. Because I know that I'm going to be owing money for so long. And I don't get work enough or get paid often enough. So I'm just stressing. I might see if I can put in an extra day at Commerce over break. Ugh, I can't wait to have a career. Joe offered to lend me money but I couldn't do that, I'd feel too bad because he really needs money too. But that was sweet of him, I love him so much.

And, my wisdom teeth hurt like a motherfucker. The end."

"event","I really have no motivation to do anything right now. Well, no motivation to go to classes at least. Today I have chorus and phonetics left, then tomorrow I have Spanish, Philosophy and Seminar. Then I'm on my way home. If I can get through these two days, I'll be fine. Tomorrow I'm going with my mom to pick up Bobbie and Norma at the airport. Their plane doesn't get in until 10:30, so it'll definitely be a late night. I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving, it's one of my favorite holidays. This year Meghan's family is coming along with Don and Shawn. YAY. I just wish Joe could come, but I don't know if it'll work because he has to go to his aunt's. Maybe after dinner he can come for dessert, we'll see. He's coming with us to dinner for my mom's birthday this Friday, so Bobbie and Norma will get to meet him then. I know they'll like him.

So there was really no point to writing this entry. I just felt like writing something before I went to chorus. Ok, bye."

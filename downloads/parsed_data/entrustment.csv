Man I can't keep up with this thing. I always forget I have it. Well, my Vystar job is going really good. I really like it. But I still have to go to training at Headquarters so until then, all I am doing is just sitting there watching people or walking around. So that's that. Jeff and I are good. We have been having some tough times lately but we'll get through it I hope. Here's a prom picture I was messing around with:

Aww aren't we just so darn cute! Oh yeah, we went to Busch Gardens July 22-24th. It was fun. I have the pictures on a Kodak Picture CD because I had to get them off of my digital camera but they won't show up on my computer. So I have to wait until I get them developed and then scan them. We took some really good pictures so I'm excited to get them printed up. 
<br>
I can't believe school starts next week. Haha and I don't have to go. That's nice. I'm going to like go up there and visit some of my now Senior friends and brag about how I don't have to go to school. lol..I kind of can't wait until I start college. The basic stuff will be boring. But my core classes will be fun. I'm going for architecture so I will probably be able to draw blueprints and stuff. It will be fun! Alrighty I'm going to go find something else to do because iduno what else to say.

&nbsp;Wow! The SuperBowl XXXIX is just around the corner and it's going to be in MY city!! How neat!@!! We have this SuperFest thing going on downtown for like a couple of days and right now, Jeff is down there with a bunch of friends and he said hes probably not gunna be home until like 2 or 3 in the morning. Yeah well he just called me and I swear he was talking like he had a slur and I think hes drunk. I'm not sure how he got a hold of any alcohol but he really sounds like he's been drinking. And I'm scared that if he has been drinking, then I'm scared hes gunna do something with a girl or kiss a girl or something. I dont know. He probably won't but I'm just nervous and scared because hes with all his guy friends and you know how guys are. But if he ever does, I swear that will be the end of it. I am NOT going to put up with shit like that. Maybe I'm just over-reacting. But iduno. Anyways.....
<br>
&nbsp;I can hear the fireworks that are going on downtown ALL THE WAY to my house...That is sooo wild@!! Very weird. I'm sittin here listening to it when I got home from eating out and I thought someone was having a party or something. Oh boy I have like 5 more days until my birthday!!! Omg!! So freakin' awesome. I can NOT wait! I'm gunna have so much fun. But anyways, enough writing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh boy I am sooo bored. My cable is out and I have no clue why. And I'm going to be pretty pissed if its out all day. Maybe I'll just sleep until I have to go to work. I go to work at 5:30-10:30. I hate closing late like that. I just hate it so much. Because everytime I close, we always have a customer that stays way past 10. Anyways, not much to talk about right now. ;/

&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow I'm bored. And kind of tired. Babysitting. Again. My mom is trying to work alot to get some extra money. So that leaves me in a situation where I cant do anything except watch my little brother. Well tomorrow night, my moms friend Michelle said he could spend the night so I can go out with Jeff. Well, thats her payment to me and Jeff because shes going to borrow Jeff to help her pick up an entertainment center with his truck. And of course he didnt mind at all because he'd do anything for me ;] hehe. Aww I love my baby. He's so good to me. But anywho, not much to really talk about. Nothing has really happened. Washed my car today. lol Yeah anyways, I'll probably post later with more to talk about. Later peeps! <3

&nbsp;Man o man I'm bored. what to do, what to do. I have been really REALLY lazy lately. Like I don't want to go to school and I don't want to go to work. That's bad. I'm so tired of working at where I work. It's so boring and it will never go anywhere. I get paid crap. And I also want a new car because mine is becoming a big p.o.s. But I cant get a new car because I need a better paying job. Well I can go work at Vystar once I have my diploma because you have to be graduated before you can work for them. My moms friend works there and she talked to the lady in Human Resources and she told her I worked for Publix, so the lady said, ""Oh well if she works for Publix then shes hired as soon as she graduates!"" Yeah well iduno. Supposedly I've got that job lined up for me when I get out of school and supposedly they'll start me out at like at least $8-$10 an hour. How sweet would that be. But if I go full time there, I'll never get done with college. Oh boy so much to think about. But I'm too tired to think. I'll just leave a picture of me and Jeff at my homecoming and then I'm goin to bed.

&nbsp;Wow! I have 4 more months until I graduate!! Omgosh I can NOT wait...and one more month until I turn 18. Woohoo!! I'll be legal. I'm going to get my tattoo that I am drawing so it will be a one of a kind. lol and I'm going to get my belly-button pierced I think...still debating. But it will be fun. I think Jeff is going to go with me. LoL I'm gunna need someone to comfort me while I'm in pain. Someone's hand to squeeze. I THINK he's gunna get one with me too. Iduno. But anywho, Jeff and I are great! He's makes me soo happy. He got me a heart necklace for christmas! It's really pretty. And on New Year's Day, before I went home at like one in the morning, he told me he loved me and said he's never told anyone that before. I was like Awww. It shocked me. I couldnt stop smiling either. ;)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His brother came down too over Christmas break. He flew down the 20th I think if I can remember right. My first time meeting him. He was really nice but very hyper. He left this past Tuesday to go to Iraq. ;/ We all went out to eat Monday night with all his family and friends and took pictures. I'll have some pictures later. Yeah and whats funny is that like sooo many people were saying that Jeff and I are so cute together and are so good to each other that we're gunna end up getting married. I was like oh gosh. It was just so funny because no lie, at least 7 people said it that night including Jeff's brother. I was like wow. But if it happens, it happens. Oh and Jeff is talking about how he wants to join the Army too like his brother. But he doesnt want anyone to know right now especially his parents because they will try to talk him out of it. So if I know you and you know Jeff too then dont say anything. Hush Hush!! But I'm gunna be sad ;( if he goes. He said he's debating on it but he'll probably go to boot camp and all that stuff over the summer. So I duno. We'll see.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Sonny's tonight and oh boy was it good. That's me and Jeff's favorite place. Jeff took me and my brother and paid for all three of us. He wouldn't even let me look at the bill. He's really sweet about paying for things. He will NOT let me pay for anything even if I just have money sitting in my wallet, he won't let me pay. And he always gives me gas money. I'm like I dont want your money. lol But whatever. He's so sweet. I'm really happy with him. But anywho, I'm about to end this massive entry. Much love!! <3

"event","So Brent just beat the shit out of Greg. They were all drunk and Windy and Greg were fighting and Greg yelled at me (why I don't know) and Brent hit him like 5 time befor Lewis could pull him off. 
Im tired of it all of it. I want to move to another town, or state, you know what fuck it another country. I can't stand them anymore with their new crowd. They are all shady people. The reprucutions from this are going to be hell.
I knew it would probably come to something like this, but I wish it never would have. I am soo tierd. I just can't take the dramma."

"event","Well we had a really good time at the holloween party. We ended up spending the night and we all went out for breakfest in the morning. Of corse I got sick so I eneded up spending the rest of the day sleeping of the benidryl and hang over. It was fun though. Caleb is really excited about trick or treating tommrow. He is going as batman and we got him a matching batman candy bucket so it should be cute. Brent won't let me get Anna a costume. I know she is only 8 months and we are not even taking her out ( she is staying with Trisha) but I think she needs the pics, and to put her costume in her keep safe box. I still have Calebs first one he was a duck. 
I am pissed though cause Desparte house wifes is a rerun. I look forward all week to this show. It is a pathetic absession I know."

Brent is going to a hokey game tonight with Willy and some other guys and I don't care but I feel like I will miss him and he is only going to be gone for a few hours. I think I am worried because he hasn't been feeling well and I don't wan't him to over due it and have to miss the party on Friday. That is selfish I know.
The good news though is that my friend Lorie called and wants me to keep her son three days a week and pay me 50.00 a week for it. It is good money, but he is one and that is a very hard age to deal with and it will limit a lot i can do during the day, but it will give someone for Caleb to play with and I really could use the money.
Oh well I just hate my period."

I don't know why he is a great Granddad, but mabey Im just a paronoied mom (no one takes care of my kids as good as me lol).

   After we got there I got sick and almost had to take my shot, but the benedryl finally kicked in and I felt better. I told Shane and Sara we can't all go out anymore cause we all just get sick.
   I like the guy Mrs Trisha was with. He waas able to take Brent and Shane's drunk humor, and that is not always easy to take. But I liked him. He is very nice and Trisha seems very happy. Actually I don't know that I have ever seen her that happy I just hope she dosn't get hurt.
   Well we finally made it home and I got Brent's drunk ass to bed and now I get some quiet befor another crazy day tommrow. So all and all it was a very good day."

"event","Tonight we went to Windy's and they asked if we wanted to go to dinner. I asked her if it would be an ok place to take Anna. (Caleb is spending the night with allan)and she said yes. It was a BAR. Yes thats right a bar. She took her two year old and said it was ok to take our 8 month old to a bar. Then after dinner when we wanted to leave beacuse I had to stand outside with anna beacuse the music was so loud they got weird. We were not rude we didn't even say we wanted to leave, but I'm sure they could tell. So anyway when they got done planning the party at their house later to night with their other friends we left. When we got home they didn't even invite us over like they use to.Now that they have their new money and their new friends they don't need us except to keep their kids. 
So anyway i have come to the conclusion tonight that at the end of the day, my kids are taken care of my family is happy and my marriage is great.We don't need them. I've got my Lee Lee, Angie and Josh, Sara and Shane, and plently of other people that don't want us just to do shit for them.
Don't get me wrong I love to party, and we do it alot. But my first priorty is my kids and my husban, and that will never change. I don't care if I am over protective of my babies, they will only be that way for a little while, and when they are older I will not have regrets. My childern and my husban will always know they are loved."

"event","This poker tournament is NEVER going to end.  I know last post I said I was done but how can I pass up free money?  This website offered a free 50 dollars with no catches and it actually worked so stupid me I join a 6 dollar tourney at 11:30 not realizing it's a quadruple shootout that takes FOREVER.

On a side note however I've made some amazing calls with middle and low pairs against bluffs.  On another side note the worst hand of the nite was definitely me in BB w/ 50k, Button (15k) minraises twice the big blind to 2400 - I have pocket 8's - I reraise to 11.5K - He thinks a minute and then calls.  I immediately thought to myself ok.. he definitely only has King high (King Jack I was thinking).   

Flop - A 4 4 - He only has like 4 K left so I push him all in.  He calls and of course has King high...... WITH A FOUR KICKER.  what an ass.  People are just TRYING to give me their chips but failing :(  Oh wellllll I made it to the third round weeeeeeeee. Time for another round and then the final table.

Ok enough about stupid poker. Whatttt happened today. Nothing. Dinner with the entire family on a Thursday!? Amazing.  And Unheard of in the Cassidy household but with a little help from those little baby chickens from Tops, some rice, some veggies, all made it possible.  Tomorrow I venture out to the land of Fredonia where Chenez is doing his final performance (in college).  That should be good because I think he wants to go to their ridiculous bars afterwards which include possibly the worst club in all of Buffalo (Sunny's).  Sunday, leaving for the big Ithaca, visitin Cornell, and generally livin it up.   And that probably means there won't be a post for a while. Sorry livejournal :(

Ok while I'm sitting here thinking and waiting for the damn tournament to move on - I'm going to start a new thing where I reminisce on Facebook.  The Sky's the limit.  Only one story per post.

Reminiscence - Back in September/October I went to the usual 514'er party.  Needless to say it was the most I think I ever drank although I really can't remember what I drank.  Then Lo decided to walk his two friends home and he says that I insisted on stopping at my place before he continued, and while they were waiting outside of my apt for me, I came out with an entirely new shirt on.  Then I randomly asked for one of Lo's friends' numbers which Chris thought was very funny and random at the time because it was a complete change of demeanor.  I proceeded to put this number into my phone under the title ""JA"" when in fact this person's name started with an ""A"" and was nowhere near JA.  Well.. after we invited them to lunch at the Stats the next day they left and I proceeded to sit down on my couch and watch some TV waiting for roomates to get home.  Then I realized I was going to be sick but didn't want to throw up in my bathroom so ended up puking more than I ever have in my entire life off the side of our porch and kept JoAnna awake for about 2 hours.  Then I'm pretty sure I drank about half a Brita Pitcher...straight from the pitcher.

The kicker to the story is the next day I called up Chris' friends to join us at the Statler and chris told me to go outside and wait for them when I met up with him.  Well, the only problem was I could not remember what these girls looked like and therefore could not meet her and her friend outside of the statler.  My first experience with Alcohol memory loss (and only the 2nd time bootin =\, 2 too many).  Let it be the last."

"event","Gym with the father in the morning was fun as usual.  I miss going at night like I used to but it's slowly turning into father/son bonding now haha.  On another note, I need to backup my harddrive because I decided to rid myself of a laptop and make the plunge back to desktops.  Decided I spend too much time having my laptop follow me around and at school it's more of a time waste than help.  So anyway went up to ComPUSA on the boulevard for CD-r's and they had a decent deal 50 for 8 bucks (I was hoping for 5)....buuuuuut I'm not greedy.  and WOW found a 200gb hd for 60 bucks which I might get.  

I wish there was some important news to write about but nothing interesting happened lately.  I could reminisce but... not feeling like it at the moment.  Lates."

"event","Dear LiveJournal, 

Twas since a fortnight since we last spoketh.  Actually it was like a day or two.  Anyway, what happened today? hmmm nothing really. I decided to play poker for the first time in a month and deposited 22 bucks into the account to play a .... you guessed it 22 dollar tourney.  180 people and I placed 18th just in the money for a profit of 22... not bad, but I probably would have done better if a guy didnt call his stack against a bluff the whole way with AQoff high...bastard.  Anyway, I think I'm done again with poker for another month, at least the online version... I'm better at reading people's reactions I think and online just annoys the hell out of me.  

I keep listening to this silly Cascada song ""everytime we touch.""  I need some better stuff, but I like those techno dance songs sometimes. (Blow my whistle B*tch)  I also listened to delegation's ""move on up"" today and then realized that their song is where Kanye sampled from for ""touch the sky"" and is probably a reason I like the song so much.  Poor Stevie Wonder though, Will Smith has ""sampled"" (stole) his songs to death.

hmm what else.  played a new mozart song today which I think I might actually be able to handle even though he's not really one of my fav classical composers.  Then of course I had to break into the Charlie Brown christmas book for some jazzzzz.  The best part of the day however was finding ""Peter and the Wolf"" exerpt in my piano book.  It's not that hard and actually kind of fun because all the notes are Staccatto so my fingers feel crazy playing it.  

Ok...ridiculous, before I mentioned the sunday Katrina meeting.  This RIDICULOUS man walked into the room while we were talking and was like ""is This the Katrina people? I Gotta talk to you guys!"" and of course the old woman running it (Erna) has no clue what is going on and thinks he is there regarding money. ""Oh yes go ahead, talk first since this is about money"" she says.  

Then the guy starts to speak: ""You're gonna see a lot of shit down there!"" he starts off.  Ok I'll admit I swear privately but what the hell... hahahhahaha randomly in the church and it's the first thing out of his mouth.... it only got better from there.

""I thought I was a strong man.  You're gonna see a lot of things you didn't think were possible, a lot of shit. The animals are all displaced...because you have to remember...they're without a home too.  YOU'RE GONNA SEE SNAKES.""

Scared old woman we are going with then says: ""Oh my! Water Moccasins?""

He replies: ""I don't know animals.  THEY WERE SNAKES! I saw 3000 snakes in the 9 days I was down there.""  "" The other thing... WEAR THICK SOLED SHOES. I WAS Down there on rooftops and the it was 118 degrees.  The sun burned my ankles right through my boots.""

I think the funniest part of this ridiculous speech is that my sister really hates it when people talk loudly/close to her and this man was practically yelling and standing DIRECTLY behind her... haha I had to cover my mouth I was trying not to laugh so hard. ahhhh old bittys.


So anyway I also got approached afterward to play Drumset for one of their services and am debating it.  For one thing I haven't played really for about 2 years and for another: I have no drumset to practice on.  Plus it seems like a lot of grandstanding in a church which is the last thing I think I want to do, considering I don't like to do it period.  Maybe I think too much into these things.

Also was thinking of doing this Pirates of Penzance play up in Buffalo for Operalytes but again.... haven't been in a play for ... like 3-4 years? I think.  And the last time I participated in one it was to play drumset.  My voice really sucks now too I think.  I wasn't that amazing of a singer to begin with but now that I haven't sung really in 4 years (except in the shower Ohhhhhhhhhh yeah) it's probably very much not ready.  I guess it would be fun but to be honest I've got some reservations to be in a play with my mom.  I'm weird about stuff like that.  She's an amazing singer but I can't stand people that overact lol... I don't mind saying it, everyone who watches those plays know.  I mean she's not bad but some things just seem ridiculous.  Plus I don't really know anyone in it except Micoli who I think choreographs or something.  buttttttt I still might do it, whooo knows.

wow. long entry. bed time."

I'm trying to sell my laptop so I can stop the mobility of the computer following me around.  Then maybe I could actually read Slaughterhouse Five, which I got out from the library a few days ago.  

Today, man was I lazy. I went to the gym real early and got home at 10:30 but ended up doing almost nothing productive all day!

Church tomorrow.  Big meeting on the Katrina visit, probably talking about where we will stay when down there.  Those old bittys crack me up though.  They worry about the most mundane details when all i can think is ""WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO DOWN THERE?!""  Honestly there are like 4 centuryans going, and I know their hearts are right, but are their backs, arthritis, and hip replacements ok!?  Oh well... they crack me up with their old bitty ways so I guess it's ok."

I'm sure there is something crazy happening in Cornell but it's pretty damn quiet in lockport.  Even the annoying dogs have shut up for the night!  Yay!

Well it's been a long time since I posted to live journal and a lot has happened since then. Summary -
JP and rubes moves in
Roomates awesome have a lot of fun parties w/ friends
school is typical, nothing interesting to report
Do relatively poor in school for the first time ever (well... not GPA wise technically) and realize I have ADD which is affecting my ability to read
Take a semester off to figure out life/work 
PARTY IN ITHACA at various times throughout spring semester babbbby.

PLus who wouldn't want to graduate with the 07'ers they are amaaazing.


I need an apt for next year :\    
My dream is to live off campus at a place that allows me to have a big golden retriever who I would walk in the arts quad during the week.  It's gonna be tough finding a place close to the ""fun"" part of collegetown that would let me have a pet though.  More thoughts later."

"event","Bad insomnia for no reason tonight.  Probably because everyone is getting back and I am partied out from last weekend :)

This livejournal is so stupid, but I'm bored, so it's actually nice :)

J.P. got in today.  Love my roomie.  He's hilarious.. we both talked about how we brought/bought candles for our amazzzing apartment and then realized how gay that was.  JP: ""Dude, stephanie brought this one back...it's like THE BEST vanilla you've ever smelled.""  lol...

Oh well, on a more manly note I hit a 295 yard drive the other day.  295 yards......right in front of the green...chip on....and you guessed it - 3 puts for a bogey :!!!!(    not cool.  Although I par'd the next hole :)

I wonder what my family is up to tonight.  Probably sleeping.  bleh. was supposed to call the sister back but forgot.  which reminds me, i need to start calling people more often...i'm just typical guy I guess.     

More randomness off the top of my head.  - Man this insomnia is not going away, I thought maybe writing would help get me tired.  I watched Mind of Mencia the other day.  Pretty funny stuff on Comedy Central.  oooooooooh yah.

Then something way better happened.  It started to flood and we attempted to float down the street, but couldnt find anything that would float.  So the great Doug and myself went to the gorge and climbed steep rocks, climbed underneath two enormous waterfalls and stood behind them.  That was.... ridiculous, amazing, dangerous.. and hell yes I'm doing it again.  BBQ beef a success as well."

GOLF BIOTCH.......


I need to birdie #16 again.  I could not have played that hole more perfect last time.  Wow.  275 yard drive down the left side of the fairway... like a 220 yard 6 Iron to the front of the green.  Little pitch up to the second tier 5 feet from the hole.  And One put.  I never birdie par 5s either.  

Wish I hadn't quit three years ago.  Amazing though that I can still hit the ball this well.  Although the short game is terrible. 

Robert Trent Jones at Cornell here I come baby.

this darn air conditioner next to me is really loud.  We can send men to the moon and build supercomputers but we can't control the sound air conditioners make.  Damn those airconditioner makers.

Driving my dad's lincoln around while the monte is in the shop is really ridiculous.  Especially ridiclous in Ithaca where everyone's car is 10 times smaller than the lincoln.  It's such a pimpmobile though.

Staying in Ithaca 100000000000x better than staying in Lockport
-------
negatives:  Have to find housing, have to pay for stuff, have to make dinner
positives: my friends are amazing for letting me stay w/ them, who cares bout paying for stuff, making dinner is hella fun, partying every weekend - beerpong on Thursday night, friday night, saturday night, sunday night, and power hour on sunday night.

other positives - watching chappelle show


I saw my old chemistry professor walking around wegmans yesterday buying donuts and fresh fish....Ithaca... one of the only places you'll find a nobel prize laureate walking around wegmans and buying fish from a hippie.

more to come later.  Working hard? or Hardly working?  (the latter)"

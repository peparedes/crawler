"event","I had to get something off my chest.  This gurl I swear is fucking stupid as hell.  I shake my head in disbelief when I hear stories.  Anyways she is my g/f's ex.  I had to stand up for myself and write that e-mail.  It goes a little something like this .....


Hey

I suppose you are wondering why, me, the dirty whore is typing you and e-mail.  First of all, I want you to realize that I and Kristin are human beings who have feelings.  The last time we had any contact with you, you were full of hateful, mean, and disrespectful things to say about each of us.  Then I see this e-mail, about your dog, and pretending that everything is fine.  How do you expect us not to notice your behaviour?  I will be expecting another hate filled email from you after you read this.  In my opinion, you  e-mailed Kristin because maybe because you needed someone/something in return.  Here is a little reminder of what you caused us the last time.

sky_angel_123: I dun wanna talk to no dirty whores.. so fuck off.. and i'm so not jealous of that piece of shit you got.. i was glad to get rid of her 'cause she was a fucking mental case.. i didn't neeed her or her shit in my life.. i coulda still had kristin if i wanted.. i didn't need her shit.. nor do i need yours so don't fucking mesage me.. 

I am sure you remember this.  Now think about it Jill, how do you expect to keep and or make friends when you treat people this way.  You hurt Kristin so many times, and you obviously know how to do it.  But now she realizes how you really are, and so do I.  I have never spoken to you, and you as well as I know you have no right speaking to me or anybody else for that matter that way.  Now I do not expect an apology from you, as I believe you are incapable of making any adult-like decisions.  Your actions show your true colors.  When your down, try and bring everyone else with you.  OOOH I can feel your blood boiling as you read this.  You want to retaliate (should I define that word for you?), and cause us both great harm.  OOH maybe call Jaime up and tell her awful things about us both, OR maybe Corey, well whatever you do, I just want you to know that people won't take or believe your shit forever.  

So, I will wait in vain for your reply.

And her reply .....


i told u and kristin that i was sorry for what i said. if that's not accepted then that's fine. i didn't have to say i was sorry. but i did 'cause i felt that i should. i don't have anything to say to you, only the mear fact that i'm sorry for what i said. i told kristin the same. i also told her about my dog 'cause i knew how much she liked her. i'm not gonna fight with you if that's what you expect from me. i have better things to do. but take care and have a good one. byeeeee"

"event","So I have been told i should let the situation with her and her ex go.  For starters, before she came out here she told me she would always love her etc, that's fine because we all have a special place in our heart for our first love's.  The thing that bugs me is that this gurl had not a pinch of respect for her, and still doesnt.  She hurt her really bad and strung her along at her own personal convenience.  Sounds fucked up right? Well obvisously that's not enough reason for to not keep in touch with this gurl.  Next we have another situation.  A few weeks ago I logged onto my yahoo, and there were these nasty offlines from this ex of hers.  In them there were remarks like ' you are a whore, and get a life and find a real woman, she's just a stupid kid' ....calling us both down and I have never spoke to this chick before.  Alright so now you are problably thinking, holy fuck what a bitch, and that my g/f would stop talking to her, in fact she started talking to her over this, and right now it seems like all is ok.  Now if my ex ever called me and my current partner such wicked names, and tried hurting us BOTH, I would have absolutely nothing to do with here.  For one I would tell her off and stay the fuck away from her.  This chick is totally fucked up, and thus i been told i should feel sorry for her, well fuck that noise, juss don't start fucking with me when you dont even know who the fuck I am.  Piss me right the fuck off !  This whole situation is messed right up, and I think it is totally disrespectful that she continues to communicate with her.   That shows me how much respect she has for me, am I right?"

It's funny, maybe because I juss knew that things were gonna be okay once she got here, but still I think to myself , holy shit, either I'm extremely lucky, or this was the way it was supposed to be.  I don't get mad alot over stupid things, well I never said I was perfect, but I still have my moments, I am kinna hard to live with I suppose.  

We are starting to look for another apartment, something 2 bedroom, omg i absolutely abhor moving !  Her friiend corey will be here around the middle of June, and well this place won't be big enough for the three of us.  And with us both working now it's possible =).  OOH, one day we were talking, bout things for the future and what not, hehe it was soo cool,  the things we wanted to buy for the apartment, shit like that, and I got the butterflies talking about it, ya know, like she actually plans on staying with me, like this is actually something long term, something meaningful and real...*sigh*  Sometimes I still think bad thoughts about us, like why is she still with me? Is it because shes 'stuck' here, or whatever ...she has a hard time expressing herself, and that kinna sucks, but I know that my patience with her is helping, I usually have no patience whatsoever, but with her, she's worth everything to me, and I will stand by her no matter what, and thats the way its supposed to be ;)"

Soooooooo  =D, mah baybee got a job and she starts on tuesday.  I am so happy for her, on the other hand, she won't always be here when I get home and that kinna makes me sad, but it will be good for both of us.  I wonder if she is nervous, I know everytime i start a new job, which hasn't been alot of times, I get extremely nervous.  There will be people that she knows there, well sort of, she met them thursday night at the bar, one of them being my ex gurlfriend, how ironic, that is how she got the job.  YaY for ex gurlfriends that get ur new gurlfriend a job! HAHA she got into both of the bars that I go to, and that totally rocks!  On thursday she got to meet a few people that even I haven't seen in ages, and my friend Charity, went on and on about what a sweetheart I am and such..LoL, she was a wee bit pickled (lol @ pickled). It was sooo much fun, and I finally got to DANCE.  I needed to get it out of my system, and now I feel better, =P.   I think we might go out tonite for a bit, we both have tomorrow off.  Unless of course I decide to have the family over.  I was thinking it would be a good idea, as thursday was my ma and auntie's birthday.  Not sure if I want to be a good lil hostess though, the idea sounded good yesterday, but.....last nite some friends showed up after work, we had juss finished supper and they showed up, I thought they had prolly went to greg's place....Kathy brought out this huge fatty, and she was bringing it to me to show me, and i tripped out, i thought it was a tampon!  OMG LOL...
Oh yeah, and we now have a dress code at work! OMG, so i had to wear a button up shirt with a collar and dress pants, holy shyte!  You see, I got this really short haircut, the shortest it has ever been, and on wednesday, a friend of mine didnt recognize me, i had a backwards hat on of course, and when she finally realized it was me she said ..."" holy, I thought it was a lil boi sitting there"" ...shhhhh but I kinna liked it =P....ok, am i gonna struggle with my identity forever? lol hopefully not...OK !! My eyes are killing me, they are but slivers upon my face.  AH, maybe this allergie stuff isnt workin because its a cold i actually have....hmmm...possibly...

I'm very rarely online anymore...and im soo ok with that, chekc email and my LJ friends, which there are only 3, and only one of them actually posts, lol, so i am updated with her, and i dont even know her, i have never talked to her.  Shes very interesting though.  Other than that, my life rules! HAHA...we started looking for a place to live too.  Something a lil closer to where she will be working, that area is better than where we live right now, omg i juss realized how boring this post is.   tis ok, nobody reads it, =P...maybe one day whiles shes at work i can get into it a lil more...haha.  It's not so much that i have a boring life, ok wait , ya it is, but now that Kris is finally here, I dont have to whine and cry about her being so far away, now i have her in my arms every night, i wake up to her and can actually kiss those amazing lips, and i'm sure i have mentioned this before but, to actually look into her beautiful eyes and tell her i love her, not through a puter...man, i still get goosebumps around her.  I love her more than anything, i swear, and *big breath* its soooooooo awesome being with her, all the waiting was well worth it!  When she's sleeping, I still go in and peek at her, and smile, when I'm at work, sometimes i fall into a daydream and juss smile, and think how lucky i truely am to have found the love of my life...and I wish that everyone finds and connects with their soulmate at one time or another, it fawkin blows my mind away still !  I wanna have babies wiff her, picnics in the summer, walks at nite, cuddle with a movie, cook supper together, and i get to do these things!!! who knew??!!  I want to show her how much I care, sometimes i dont think i show it, but i think she knows how i feel *wink* uh huh, i have mah baybee...and she has me, and everything couldnt be more perfect, dayum!  awwwww, she went and bought me this kick ass hoodie, its big, black and baggy, and on the front ....*drum roll please* TOOL ! heh heh....hottie!

I am so bored with this online business, there is nothing here anymore, i guess i meant it when i said the only reason i was online was to talk to her, and now shes here ....and yes i still love her with all my heart, that will never change.....i told her i was an asshole, maybe now she is starting to believe me ....she's not the one who should be worried about fuckin this up, that should be me....with my moods, they can change so easily, my pride and stubborness,  my self centeredness, and my need for attention   ....these are the qualities about myself i really dont like..its juss a matter of changin them...or letting go of old useless behaviours .  I did some reading on NLP (neurolinguistic programming) , one of the modalities i chose in college, and it mentioned ...my map in my brain, letting go of old behaviours, as they are not useful anymore, the map was 'conditioned' in my first 7 years of my life, so things get old, what the unconcious mind learns, it can also unlearn, which is quite remarkable considering its not our 'concious' mind, and most ppl dont realize we have access to that....

I dont think she minds? but even if she does she wouldnt say anything ....and i know she is scared of finding a job, but im not too worried about it, its not like i cant take care of her right now ya know? but at the same time shes gonna hafta do it sooner or later....im even scared for her, ...blah !

things I Love about her

shes absoutley beautiful inside and out
shes sensitive
shes easy to talk to
i trust her in a way that i cant anyone else
shes patient with me
shes snuggly
she baffs me =)
shes not high maintenance, meaning, she is easily amused like i am =P
she has so much love to give
she accepts me as i am

I Love everything about her, and dont get me wrong, im not delusional and think she has no faults, because we all do, but i can honestly say that i love everything about her, and i knew i did/would, long before she even moved here.  And u know what? Even tho i seem that i dont have an insecure bone in my body, but i do.  I still think,, why??? why does she love me? does she love me the same way i love her? I have to take into account that she moved across the entire country to be wiff me...thats a big ol' slap to the head....wake up!!! but still...i get down on myself once in awhile ....i juss wish i could ask her that stuff i was 'supposed' to before she got here, mainly about her ex gurlfriend and or gurlfriends that she still talks to ...thats the biggest thing, i noticed a name on one of her messengers that really hit me in the gut ....when i seen it i got sick to my stomach,...cuz *ugh* thats the nickname she calls me, but looks like she called another chick that name before me ...eww...ugh ....sounds pretty silly i know, but it kinna hurts, and a kick to the ego ...my big shining ego....haha in any case, maybe i should put down some of the things i love about myself, and remember who and what i am, to myself as well as to other people....

other than that, things are amazing with her.  we get along fine, and the intimacy is cool too...i forgot what it was like to be so close to another person, and its different with her because so much happened so fast, i dont take my clothes off that easily for anyone, in a sense that all the lights are on and im totally vulnerable with her...and i dont mind...i dont have to pretend to be anyone that im not around her ....no acting. no bullshittin, juss me...thats all i have...its so fuckin cool i tell ya !

i asked her this morning if i could lie to my ma about her age, my ma is cool , yes, but she still has a problem with me being gay.  She still has this fantasy in her head that one day i will meet a man, get married and have children....and thats not in my 'vocalbulary' if anything, i will have children with Kris, beautiful babies, like her and I,  i can see that in our future....oh yes ...its gonna happen *sigh*...in time, when we are ready and can settle down, both have jobs, where life is juss a lil more stable ...of course right now its too damn early =P...but i know it will happen.... =D  oh damn, i juss got shooed outta my daydream, i have things i have to do today before i go out for lunch ..."

Why do I have to be so stubborn? I seem to have this nasty pattern, when I love someone, i let them in, and only so far, and then subtly, i push them away, and eventually it gets so bad that things end up being all fucked up, and it's really something that I can stop, or is it .....I didnt mean it ! =( i really honestly didnt, im such a fuck up and a loser that i do this shit to the people that care most about me, i fuck up their lives as well as mine, I am a fuck up, and i warn ppl ahead of time, you don't want to be messed up in my fucked up world, you dont want to play my games, i will fuck with you and ...ya ...i totally suck !  This could have easily been resolved, but my fuckin pride gets in the way and i dont ask what i want to know, either that or shes not willing to tell me what goes on in her life, she knows so much about me, my thoughts, feelings, emotions behind every event that has happened since we met.  And i dont have the balls to fuckin ask her u know? Sometimes i think she should juss volunteer the information , without me asking, because when i do that ...1.  I am afraid of the answers and 2. I feel like im prying, and if it were any of my fuckin business she would have told me right? or not? I'm not to sure....Why do i have to be such a fuck up?  There are so many things i wanted to ask her, for so long, and i wish i would have sooner, then maybe i could have moved on past this shit, like...well im not gonna put it in here, i will have to grow sum balls and ask her i guess.....*sigh* i dont want to start pittying and feeling sorry for myself, its my own fault yes, but i can change the way things will go , i can let go, and move on, i will sit here until she gets home ....i miss her, and she doenst even know her way around the city, FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK"

"event","i have decided, afta all of what that asshole has put me thru the last few days, including physically  hurting me, makin me sob like a lil bitch at work in front of customers as he continued to smirk in my face, im tellin our boss greg..HA HA ..greg luvs me and if i told him what happened, he will most likely go ballistic, they are in Van right now tho, so not until tomorrow ....he's gonna wish he neva did this, ...does it not sound like grade 2 behaviour here? oh yes it does ...but the thing is ...supervisors shouldnt let that go to their head and physically hurt us lil under dogs ...especially since we were friends first ...he said sumfin bout ' well now i have responsibilities, and i dont have time to play with you anymore "" ....so that gives him all the right in the world to fuckin choke me??? like honestly WHAT   THE   FUCK ??!!  i could see if he juss brushed me off and kept on walkin, but dude ....he's sooo dead ! Oh yeah, i called dee from work, she couldnt understand a word i was sayin ...and hes standing right there ...she came to work to get me, and held my while i cried cuz i was a wreck ..the whole time hes prancing around the store all happy and proud ....THAT pissed me off ...because he really thinks he did nothing wrong ..."

"event","so as if today wasnt harsh enough, customers from hell and what not because its saturday ....so....im assuming he's power tripping because he got promoted and i dint, fine ....BUT ...do NOT manhandle me like im ur fuckin buddy ! this is exactly what happened ( almost in tears ) ...he gets the shit outta the safe or w/e ...hes up at cs where im working ...so i playfully get in his way to be silly, he then takes his right arm and puts me in a headlock, continues to smash my windpipe, and i bite my tongue because it startled me, since he pretty much has just hurt me ....he lets go and stomps off ...all this in front of my customers ... so u could say i was in shock, and i immediately grabbed my throat because it hurt ....it still feels funny .,...like holy fuck...i dont care who you are, u DO NOT use force on a woman ...i dont care if were buddies or not ...anyways...i ask him later, uhm ....did u try to hurt me on purpose? ... ""yes, did it work, did i get my point across?"" ...tell me that wasnt a fuckin power trip ...then i think he realized what he had done earlier, all tryin to be nice ...i woundt look at him, and i asked that i get another supervisor to cash me out ....fuck him ....i could cry ...i thought we were friends"

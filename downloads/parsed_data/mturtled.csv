"event","Wow, I haven't done this in a while... writing at all for that matter, which is strange for me, because it's usually my best coping mechanism.  I haven't been sleeping well lately either, that is when I'm trying to, but I daydream off the hook.  I have all these visions, but not the type that I want to turn into art, just the type that make me feel crazier than I already do every day, and it makes me want to distance myself from people.  Ironically, here I am spilling my guts, but it feels okay so whatever... 
I went to this poetry reading the other day, and I found myself thinking that some of the stuff sucked.  I'm stupid for thinking that, because at least those people have the balls to spill their guts in front of complete strangers, and idiot critics like me.  Some of the poems were amazing though, and inspiring.  The last time I read a poem in front of complete strangers, I started crying, and I don't usually do that, and it was fucking horrifying.  It was one of those moments you see on tv or in movies, that until it happens to you, you think of as some sort of exageration.  But I actually felt like I was looking over my own shoulder, and I was like, ""Oh my god, you're so fucking pathetic, shut up, shut up, shut up!"" I felt like running out, but I was completely immobilized.  Yay, my first non-drug induced out of body experience!
Lately, and pretty much for my entire life, I've wanted to write a novel, but the only writing I feel I can succeed at is short stories, and that's because you don't have to fully commit.  I feel like everything I make artistically is self indulgent, and in vain sometimes.  Other times I'm okay with it, because at least it makes me feel better.  I guess what it comes down to is not feeling interesting enough to write a novel, and I'm probably right, but...  I haven't written a short story in a while, so maybe I'll test the waters.
It's wierd, this is the first period of time in a long time when I don't feel as if I'm slowly losing my mind, but the more I think about it, the more I think maybe I'm just already there..."

My street lamp is so glacially alone in the night.
The small paving stones lay their heads down all around
where it holds up its lightumbrella over them
so that the wicked dark will not come near.

It says: We are all far from home.
There's no hope anymore.

                   - ROLF JACOBSON

ENIGMAS

You've asked me what the lobster is weaving there with his golden 
     feet?
I reply, the ocean knows this.
You say, what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparent bell? What is 
     it waiting for?
I tell you it is waiting for time, like you.
You ask me whom the Macrocystis algae hugs in its arms?
Study, study it, at a certain hour, in a certain sea I know.
You question me about the wicked tusk of narwharl, and I reply by
     describing
how the sea unicorn with a harpoon in it dies.
You inquire about the kingfisher's feathers,
which tremble in the pure strings of the southern tides?
Or you've found in the cards a new question touching on the crystal
     architecture
of the sea anemone, and you'll deal that to me now?
You want to understand the electric nature of the ocean spines?
The armored stalactite that breaks as it walks?
The hook of the angler fish, the music stretched out
in the deep places like a thread in the water?

I want to tell you the ocean knows this, that life in its jewel boxes
is endless as the sand, impossible to count, pure,
and among the blood-colored grapes time has made the petal
hard and shiny, made the jellyfish full of light
and untied its knot, letting its musical threads fall
from a horn of plenty made of infinite mother-of-pearl.
I am nothing but the empty net which has gone on ahead
of human eyes, dead in those darknesses,
of fingers accustomed to the triangle, longitudes
on the timid globe of an orange.

I walked around as you do, investigating
the endless star, 
and in my net, during the night, I woke up naked,
the only thing caught, a fish trapped inside the wind.

ALL WHICH ISN'T SINGING IS MERE TALKING, by E.E.CUMMINGS
all which isn't singing is mere talking 
and all talking's talking to oneself
(whether that oneself be sought or seeking
master or discipline sheep or wolf)
gush to it as deity or devil
-toss in sobs and reasons threats and smiles
name it cruel fair or blessed evil
it is you (ne I) nobody else
drive dumb mankind dizzy with haranguing 
-you are deafened every mother's son-
all is merely talk which isn't singing
and all talking's to oneself alone
but the very song of (as mountains
feel and lovers) singing is silence

A NAME FOR ALL, by HART CRANE
Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page
And still wing on, untarnished of the name
We pinion to your bodies to assuage
Our envy of your freedom-we must maim
Because we are usurpers, and chagrined-
And take the wing and scar it in the hand.
Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;
But we must die, as you, to understand.
I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang
As only they can praise, who build their days
With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang
Struck free and holy in one Name always.

FOR MY GRANDMOTHER, by COUNTEE CULLEN
This lovely flower fell to seed;
    Work gently, sun and rain;
She held it as her dying creed
    That she would grow again.

MOSS-GATHERING, by THEODORE ROETHKE
To loosen with all ten fingers held wide and limber
And lift up a patch, dark-green, the kind for lining
    cemetary baskets,
Thick cushiony, like an old-fashioned doormat,
The crumbling small hollow sticks on the underside mixed
    with roots,
And wintergreen berries and leaves still stuck to the top,-
That was moss-gathering.
But something always went out of me when I dug loose
    those carpets
Of green, or plunged to my elbows in the spongy yellow-
    ish moss of the marshes:
And afterwards I always felt mean, jogging back over the
    logging road,
As if I had broken the natural order of things in that
    swampland;
Disturbed some rhythm, old and of vast importance,
By pulling off flesh from the living planet;
As if I had committed, against the whole scheme of life, a 
    desecration.

THE CHILD'S SIGHT, by HY SOBILOFF
The child's sight is in saying
They say what they see when they see it
I am beginning to remember how
When I don't say it when I see it
I remember it differently
I am walking with the children
They have included me
None of us eavesdrops any more
We speak the same celestial gibberish
Our spirit ticks the same time
I feel again and am part of the inside world
The child is a little inspector when it crawls
It touches and tastes the earth
Rolls and stumbles toward the object
Zigzags like a sail
And outmaneuvers the room
I am learning the child's way
I pick up wood pieces from the ground
And see shapes into them
I notice a purple velvet bee resting on a flower
And stop to listen to its buzz
They have included me
And though I will not be put away to rock alone
And I don't roll down the plush hills
Nor spit for luck
I am learning their way
They have given me back the bliss of my senses

MAN AND WIFE, by MITCHELL GOODMAN
It was late, we
talked     it all
came out     words
fell     we stuffed them
in each other's ears
I talked, she listened
and agreed. Not
enough. Don't shout
she yelled, Don't-I'm 
not-. Quietly: In other
words, I said-There are
no other words
she said. Think. I 
(thought) can't think.
Words she could not say
I said, then she 
spoke for me.
Be a woman, I said.
What is a woman,
she asked, nakedly,
taking off her clothes. That 
ended it. The next night 
we began again, as if 
there were someone
who knew 
the answer.

FURTHER NOTICE, by PHILIP WHALEN
I can't live in this world
And I refuse to kill myself
Or let you kill me
The dill plant lives, the airplane
My alarm clock, this ink
I won't go away
I shall be myself-
Free, a genius, an embarrassment
Like the Indian, the buffalo
Like Yellowstone National Park.

THE TORTOISE, by CID CORMAN
Always to want to
go back, to correct
an error, ease a 
guilt, see how a friend
is doing. And yet
one doesn't, except
in memory, in 
dreams. The land remains
desolate. Always
the feeling is of 
terrible slowness
overtaking haste.

THE HANGMAN'S LOVE SONG, by STANLEY MOSS
In the house of the hangman
do not talk of rope,
or use death, half death,
little death; the victim
always hangs himself,
trap sprung, tongue ripped
like love in the house.
Despite the world's 
regalia, I want
a useful funeral.
High, on tip-toe,
swinging back
and forth, the victim,
who cannot speak,
mimics the bell,
such things as bait
for wild game, and love.
Brain hung and heart,
hope swings, sun creaks,
rope in the wind,
and the hangman sings.

ZIZI'S LAMENT, by GREGORY CORSO
I am in love with laughing sickness
it would do me a lot of good if I had it-
I have worn the splendid gowns of Sudan,
carried the magnificent halivas of Boudodin Bros.,
kisssed the singing Fatimas of the pimp of Aden,
wrote glorious psalms in Hakhaliba's cafe,
but I've never had the laughing sickness,
so what good am I?
The fat merchant offers me opium, kief, hashish, even
     camel juice,
all is unsatisfactory-
O bitter damned night! you again! must I yet
pluck out my unreal teeth
put to sleep this melancholy head?
I am nothing without the laughing sickness.
My father's got it, my granfather had it;
surely my Uncle Fez will get it, but me, me
who it would do the most good,
will I ever get it?

THE PEACE OF WILD THINGS, by WENDELL BERRY

When despair for the world grows in me
and I wake in the night at the least sound
in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,
I go lie down where the wood drake
rests in the beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.
I come into the peace of wild things
who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief. I come into the presence of still water.
And I feel above me the day blind stars
waiting with their light. For a time
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free."

"event","i'm sitting here alone in justin's room, and it's one of those times when you just feel really alone, and not just because you actually are in ""reality,"" but whatever that's not the point.  the point is i just watched this documentary on Larry ""wildman"" Fischer, and it was totally moving.  you know when you're feeling a certain way for a while, maybe forever, and something or someone comes along and says, hey me too?  well i guess that happens to me and probably most people all the time, but this time it felt unique, perhaps because of how unique this guy was.  although as crazy and different as he was, i could identify with all of his disorders, all of his songs, well maybe not the one about killing his mom, but who am i kidding, maybe a little, and mostly i identified with what the movie was intending to represent: his madness.  the fact that the wheels inside his head never stop spinning, it was captivating to watch, and so cutting, and i'm writing this as if you've seen the movie because i can't bring myself to describe it.  it wasn't the way it was made that captivated me, but the person it was about, how much of him is soooooo human, and it was sad, and he lost his pep, and all i wanted to do was to sing with him, and to take him away from the institution, and to let him have his pep, and there are so many out there like him, lost, me, you, maybe just me, maybe just some of us, mark mothersbaugh.  he was paranoid, but who isn't, he was self absorbed, but who isn't, he was emotional, but who isn't, he was mad, but who isn't, he was inspired.

i didn't want to laugh at him, i don't want to laugh at anyone, i don't know why we do it, perhaps it makes us feel smart, superior, but what the fuck does that matter anyway, and fuck yeah aunt josephine you are awesome!

"event","I've enjoyed poetry class probably the most out of all of my classes.  It's fun to hear what all kinds of different people have to say, and I don't feel like I have much to say, but I thoroughly enjoy writing for all kinds of reasons.  Recently I was browsing around and I saw that people had commented on my live journal.  The best was Lizzy Cupcake all like, who are you?  Your identity is vital information.  I found that to be funny, and also there was a comment from Keving saying he'd like to see some of my poetry for class.  I thought that was cool that he was interested so here is some of it, I'm sorry if you find it to be cheesey, but I kind of am (that's not vegan):

The most recent poems we wrote were Haikus and Sonnets, so here are the ones that the few people I showed liked, and I apologize because they are really cheesey, but I can't write like this:

Haikus:

As turtle ducks back             
into its shell, I wonder         
        is it personal?          

Sun yields sweaty hands. 
I hide them in my pockets,
and you seek them out.

Pretty girls in skirts
sway side to side like the wind
in its absence.

Rain seems permanent.            
You almost never see the         
coming of its bow.               

Why wait for the bus
when you can walk?  Otherwise,
you may miss the view.

Submachine gunfire
lulls me to sleep tonight, yet
         the silence wakes me.

You smiled at me once.
I forget while near your corpse:
swelled, bloated, blue... still.

Sonnets:

If a couple of kids ever ask you                                        
if they can pet your snake, 
never pass up the chance to                                              
let them touch it and you, and take
the time to meet each other.
For you might just end up smoking a spliff
in people's park, and if you really get to know one another,
who know if
you might just end up with matching fuzzy hats-
green and orange, with ears and puff balls.
For it would be lying to say that that's
not reason enough to stall,
to stop on a crowded city street,
and give yourself a chance to meet, a friend.

That was the most recent stuff I've written for class, and now here are some poems from the rest of the year, and i guess that's it, okay here goes:

Jonicris (the three-part R&B sensation)                                    By Mary Davis and Matt Dostal

Penetrating ringworm living in my belly,
That's you girl
Scary balls ferry scraping 
You guessed it baby, that's me.
Hairy food corrosion
is the love we make together.
Please honey, broomstick my Shintoism claws
so that the penis pump may elongate my poop
puffing scales, ooh yeah.
Bumpy slicing toofs, yeah that's right sugar.
Your gargantuan Shiva belly
along with my
bulbous slimy warts cutting rheumatoid arthritis.
Grinding bloated demonic peasants,
star tattoos haunting, 
testicles, Boo!  Tentacles taunting to the touch.
I'm a 
Monster, screaming, violating
and you're ready for my
jagged bile injection.
With my silly spooky nose ring huffing 
boils and barf,
ending in one hell of a satisfying
napalm death.

Shit, at ten pounds less, I'd be fucking Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, AND Tom Cruise.  And their girlfriends, oh sorry, I seem to have forgotten their names... Oh yeah, Angelina, Jennifer, and Katie, yeah, they'd be sooooo jealous of my hot body.  Fuck I'd probably fuck them too, and with my boob job, they'd never be able to resist me.  Yeah!  We'd all be fucking and having a great time because we're rich and famous and fabulous, and oh I'm so happy.  I'd be so happy then, so happy, I'D BE SO FUCKING HAPPY!

I.D.

Name:  She had a little lamb, quite contrary was she, called hairy fairy, never understood the connection, though Jesus she bore and married as well, a different one that is, but the same name, so many of them, so common, so many songs, so many associations, rhymes with so much, doesn't say shit about who she is, but her grandmother was called by the same.

Address:  up on a hill with a skyline view she rests, head in hands, surrounded by the houses that swallow up the hillsides, each day spitting out their inhabitants and their machines.  Wild are the deer, roosters, foxes, coyotes, boars, rats, and insects that also inhabit these ever fading hillsides, wild like her heart.  Behind a fence may be found other living creatures like the dogs that talk to each other in the day time or the horses that stand silent behind, or in a box can be found reptiles and insects and rodents, and the soul of the one laying observant of it all identifies mostly with them, like a turtle hiding in its shell.

Sex:  no name-calling necessary, it knows what it is.  It's told so every day, in how to dress and act and feel.  It covers up good to avoid any unwanted confrontation that showing a little skin entails.  Sex and sexual frustration prevalent in the air, on tv, on billboards and in magazines, everyone looking, lusting, envying, practically grabbing and grappling with this need, lonely, craving to feed this hunger, deesire, it cowers in shame of its association with any of this, wanting to free itself of this unwanted pressure, bearing down.  But it will never be able to hide the knowledge of its vagina.  It can only try to blend in or disgust.

Hair:  Many colors on top, why be boring?  Although boring is nice, one can blend in, sit quietly, but one can do so and still express one's self.  So why not?  Shaving it's unnecessary though many like her find it repulsive.  The shock in one's glare when so much as an arm is raised is laughable, even on the faces of some friends at times, though they try to hide their disgust out of respect.  Thanks, but she's not ashamed to be natural.  What are they trying to hide she wonders, for she knows why she used to do it but because everyone does things for different reasons, she stays curious.

Eyeballs:  Always watching and observing her surroundings.  Many respond with frightened fleeting glances, fear.  She has a staring problem and she's not ashamed.  Why can't people look each other in the eyes, she wonders?  Other animals don't have the same problem, she's shared many a long silence with horses on the sides of roads, and dogs on the streets.  She's fascinated with this and wants to find out if it's simply something contained within her gaze, that causes people to look away.

DOB:  The day her soul started its quest to free itself from the confines of the body and this world, and the day her eyeballs started wandering , and she was spat out and all of it began as far as she can remember, and it will be much like her last day, the day when she will know again what everything means.  She wishes to go back to the wisdom of this day.

Trace the metal in my mouth
To find waves of... has it hit me?

Mind plays tricks
Knows my desire to
                      TRIP...                                                      oh shit i got my wish
For I can't help but watch 
Trees as they sway stretching
To swirl about in geometric patterns
On the backdrop sky

One reaches
Consumes the space between my eyes.

I grab for it--gone,
nothing...
nothing but pulsing pelvises
remain manipulative minds, reality.
""If I imagine it, is it explicitly illusion?""
I ask the goddess in the sky.

No answer she gives no pause.
Just swallows sky whole, 
BLACK
All but for the tiny hole that glows-
Her mouth--the only light left.

Trees stretch to it, as if asking for a bite
to be taken, her tongue taunting,
she sits oblivious,
mouth wide.

Branches penetrate light,
cracks of it 
torn through the black sky illuminate
as they jab and tear,
the sky begins to fall.

Thinking trees have turned,
No shelter,
I run.

Beneath swift feet the ground trembles
as if anticipating-

I slip.
I'm sliding down muddy slopes.
Time to glane ahead
as earth's edge approaches.

Quickly gasping,
hold my breath,
as if about to hit the ocean,
the end closing in on me,
I look up.

The sky is back...
Goddess smiles.
Trees done having their way,
With her should I have stayed?

I wonder while 
LAUNCHED
out and into
eyes shut..."

"event","today i went to a funeral service at a church... other than the church and sadness, it was nice to see some of my friends that i rarely see...  one of them is going to UC santa cruz next year, so perhaps i'll see her more often... i didn't do much of anything today other than that, it sort of put me in a depressed state, especially since i was with my mother all day long, and i'd spent the night at her house... i couldn't sleep last night, so i stayed up watching Frida, every episode of a documentary show on trans gender college students on the Sundance Channel, yeah my mom's hella rich, and reading old journals and looking at old pictures and reading old letters, which was really weird... i spent another part of the night writing a letter that i'll probably never give, but maybe...  oh well today was a new, although dreary day, even though it was beautiful in San Jose...  oh but i did do a huge painting, it's kinda crazy, but so am i..."

"event","i've been stressing out over this final project we have to do in anthropology, because i want to do a good job and i don't want to have to talk about something boring.  so i chose this girl who i sort of know through school because she is nice and interesting.  i felt bad because the project is on ethnicity and i felt like i was interrogating her about an uncomfortable topic.  i kind of felt like after the interview that she had just done it to be nice but hadn't really wanted to because she even said during that she didn't really like talking about issues of ""race"" and i don't either, but i had to.  i didn't have to do it to her though and i wish i'd known ahead of time because she seemed really unhappy when she left, and even though i tried to make her comfortable and let her talk about whatever, i feel like she had to think too much, dodging topics and trying not to get too deep into what she didn't want to.  i smoked her out too! and that was probably a bad idea considering she was already in her head hell of by having to talk about her life for like an hour.  but the okay part was that in the end i sort of changed the subject, allowing her to talk about anything, and she seemed to sort of come out of the state i'd put her in.  i'm not going to assume that she was sooo affected by me as i thought, but i hope she's alright now.  she said she was going out with her friends tonight and i hope she's having a good time.  i feel awful, and i hope that my paper isn't too hard to write now. i'm getting drunk..."

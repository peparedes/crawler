I'm getting right back into the college swing of things... last weekend was awesome because I got to see Audrey on Friday night and try some new things on Saturday.  The only bad thing about being back is having no motivation whatsoever to work.  I'd rather be reading or talking to people down the hall... hehe.  So I'm a little behind on my work.  But I'm involved in other stuff as well, in fact I just got back from lacrosse practice and I'm starving, so I'm going to go eat now.  But yeah, things are going well.

P.S.  I love Siobhan!!  (hehe hi Siobhan)
P.S.S.  Emerson Drive update: the picture of my friends and I with our Emerson Drive t-shirts that we made are in the CarrollNews (school newspaper)!  Woo hoo!"

"event","I just had the most amazing night ever!!  Seriously, one of my top college experiences so far.  Emerson Drive (the band) came to John Carroll, and everything about my whole day was incredible.  They are my new favorite band, not even kidding.  I liked them before, but now I'm just absolutely completely in love.

I'm on the Student Union Programming Board (SUPB) so I got to the concert venue at about 2, 6 hours before the show even starts.  My roommate Angela and my friend Jenny were there with me.  I got to see them do soundcheck (it was just me in this huge auditorium, standing against the wall, and the lead singer looked over and saw me.  I almost died.), and then the two absolute highlights of MY LIFE up until that point: they forget to get utensils for the band's meal, so I sprinted to the cafeteria on the other end of campus and back with forks, which I just realized that I forgot to take back.  And then I ran up to their dressing room, and i was alone in a small room with Emerson Drive for a few brief seconds, but at this point I was breathing rather heavily from running so fast.  But still, it was great.  And then, later I was outside on the phone, and the lead singer (REALLY hot) and the guitar player came out and said hi to me.  It was amazing.  

So they do their show from 9:00-10:00, and I've never seen anybody play live who had so much fun, except the tapes of Beatles at their early concerts.  They were joking around with each other and getting so intensely into the music.  And the attention wasn't centered on the vocalist, although he was an amazing performer.  A lot of attention went to the fiddler and the bassist.  They randomly played the Sega theme song at one point.  The whole band seemed to love being on stage, especially the fiddler.  He was swinging his hips at girls in the audience and grinning the whole time.  A lot of the girls I went with weren't too enthusiastic about country music, but now they're seriously excited about it, because they saw how intense and lively it could be.

And then after, we actually got to meet them!!  This is deserving of multiple exlamation points!!  My friends and I had made our own t-shirts the night before: each person was one letter of EMERSON DRIVE, so together we spelled out the band.  (On the back it says Emerson Drive, JCU, January 29, 2005)  So (in order) it was Jeaninne, Sarah, Jenny, me (I was the ""R""!  how great is that?!), Angela, Jovanna, Tressa, Jamie, Jess, Virginia and Irena.  Some of us has passes from helping out earlier, but most of us didn't.  But the band had actually seen us and our shirts from stage, and agreed to a picture with all of us... although the ""E"" left, so we were Emerson Driv, which looks kinda dumb.  But they told us all how much they liked the shirts.  The lead singer said, ""Thanks so much for making those!"" and I just told him it was fun.  And then as we were leaving I asked the drummer for a hug and he gave me one!!  So that just made the night perfect, ESPECIALLY because he was amazingly hot.

Afterward I called my friend Meghan to tell her, but I seriously couldn't breathe.  My face turned bright red and I was gasping for air.  For those of you who are not country fans, Emerson Drive is a pretty big deal.  This one girl actually stopped breathing when she met them.  They were like, ""Honey, are you okay?!""  I still can't believe that I hugged them, that they said ""hi"" to me, or they liked our shirts.  It's almost 4:00 in the morning, I got less than 4 hours of sleep last night, and I'm still on an incredible rush.  Emerson Drive kicked some major ass.  The picture of all of us with our shirts posing with the band is the new background of my computer.  and they signed our shirts, so that is going to get framed for sure!  Everytime I look at my wristband, the one I bought for admittance, I get these happy shivers.

Anyway, it was incredible. I LOVE EMERSON DRIVE!!!!"

Angela/Ruth,

On December 21, 2004 the residence hall Chaplin. Lauren 
Ivory reported that the door to your room, Dolan #210 was 
standing open. One of our officers secured the door to your 
room on that date. Did either of you return to your room 
after finals? If not please check your room when you return 
to make sure that everything is all right. If there is a 
problem please contact our department right away. Thank you.



How weird is that!!!  Neither of us returned to our room after the 17th.  Maybe our room is haunted or something.

On another note, not much has changed in WT bsaketball.  I'm not sure whether to be smug or cry."

"event","yaaaaaaay for 2005!  I have to make this quick, because my sister is bound to come up soon and confiscate the computer for her schoolwork, and my laptop doesn't have internet access here in good ol' pgh.

it's been a good year, or at least an interesting one.  Break has been fun, I got to see so many people that I missed over Thanksgiving: Susan, Katelyn, Rajiv, Bhavani, Ian, and later tonight Molly, Nikki, Nickia and Allison are coming over.  And of course I got to see my Marky (and episodes of Desperate Housewives yipppeee!) So that's all fun and games.  I didn't realize quite how much I missed my Dub-tizzle people.  Mark had a *fabulous* x-mas party at his house, complete with champagne, and he gave me From Justin to Kelly, which I've always wanted. ;O)  And we made the requisite Eat'n'Park trip, of course, just like the days of yore.  Katelyn was (yet again) mistaken for Susan and asked to lick her elbow. I guess some things never change.

For New Year's Eve I went to Jamie's house, and it was SOOOO great to see her again... now that I'm in Pittsburgh I miss my Dolan girls, so we got to hang out and play Cranium (the best game in the world!!) with some of her friends.  hehe I <3 jamie.  

And of course I've been working like a beast at Taco Bell.  Who would think that everyone and their mother would want tacos on Christmas eve??

I'm getting pumped for Immokalee... in less than a week, I will be down in Florida, hopefully getting a nice tan.  This may be impeded by 2 things: a.) I forgot my swimsuit in my dorm and b.) my skin doesn't really tan.  However, I'm determined to enjoy the sun.  And, of course, I'll be getting serviced (LOL jamie)  I probably shouldn't forget the real reason I'm going to Immokalee, which is to help people.  But the weather certainly doesn't hurt.  

May 2005 bring great things to everyone out there!"

"event","I'm enjoying college... strangely enough.  :O)  saturday night, a hypnotist came to school, hyponotized a whole stage of people, and made them see and do some of the weirdest things.  One guy (when hearing certain superhero music) believed he was PORNO MAN, who could put out fires by humping them.  He humped a barney doll, the hyponotist's legs, and some guy in the audience.

my roommate is awesome, and later this week, we're having a country party with some girls down the hall.  last night we had a VMA party, but the VCR didn't work and hadn't taped it, so we watched Road Rules instead.  and tonight we're all going to Pilates class.

My classes are good, the campus is nice, there's always something to do, and later tonight Audrey's coming up to see me.  So everything's pretty good, although I have moments were I miss people, or don't know what I'm doing, where I'm going, or how to set up my computer (hehe just an example.)

And now... I saved the best news for last. I got a job in the intramural department as a referee!!  the supervisors just called me and told me.  I'm so excited, I have a job where I can stay on my feet and actually get involved.  plus, everyone in that department is so nice.  

okay, I realize this post is sort of boring, but I thought I let everyone know what I was up to.  I hope you all from (or at) WT are doing well.

But I know something's coming
I don't know what it is
But I know it's amazing, you save me 
My time is coming
And I'll find a way out of this life

well, I am too, as of Thursday. I have been shopping, cleaning, packing, and shopping some more to get ready.  It seems like everyone is excited, which I certainly am, but I think I'm more scared than excited.

I almost want to stay in my safe little summer cocoon of working and kung fu and watching Friends, rather than making any changes. (which reminds me, season six is so good!  it's too bad Chandler's fat.)

Since that's not really an option, off I go on Thursday.  There was more I wanted to say, but I have a feeling it would just become one giant to-do list, which isn't interesting to anyone but me."

"event","So I'm jet lagged and tired, but it was an awesome experience.  My uncle lives in Bali, so the culture shock wasn't too bad.  but it's so different over there: there are a million rules.  You can't put your hands on your hips, can't drink straight out of the bottle, and you definitely can't wear shorts.  I did once on a hike and people wouldn't even talk to us, even though Balinese people are usually really friendly.  They don't have a word for ""rude"" because it's not in their culture; they just use the English word.

everything's also really cheap.  our hotel was $6 a night (60,000 rupiah), and my mom got massages every day for $2.50.  at first some things are priced really high, but we learned how to bargain really fast.  you find something you like, and ask how much it is.  the vendor uses a calculator to show how much they want.  you laugh merrily and name a much cheaper price.  they laugh merrily and refuse.  and so it goes...  my dad got really into it.  

We went rafting, hiking, to the temples, saw a cockfight, saw Balinese dancing, learned Balinese dancing, drank rice wine every night, and taught English to a group of disabled teenagers.  it was amazing.

Although now I can't fall asleep at night and can't function during the day."

I'm going to John Carroll University next year; I won the Patricia Schuger Mathematics Award; lacrosse team went to the playoffs; and my sister horribly mutilated my eyebrows with a seemingly innocent strip of wax.

All of these, except the last, are very exciting (to me...)

I've filled out all the various housing and orientation forms for JCU.  the only remaining question is: what exactly is my musical taste?  (there is no category for ""BAD"")

I got the math award partly because Ms. Bonventure still can't believe that I did linear regression by hand instead of buying a better calculator like any sane person (I hesitated to remind her that I got a D on the linear regression test).  

Girl's lacrosse was the first team ever to have made it to the playoffs, and that by itself was amazing.  (I started off hating it, but now I think I'm going to play next year on the club team)

We're not even discussing the wax.

it's hard to remember what's happened; I haven't been able to focus on much lately.  I sort of feel disconnected to everything.  it's strange, but reality has often felt very unreal recently.  

New York is the only thing that seems real, probably because it's tomorrow.  so I'm going to go pack.  :O)

"event","I'm so cold.

Our lacrosse game today was outside, in the freezing rain and hail and -30 degree wind chill.  Our uniforms are sleeveless tops and cute little skirts.  I thought my hands would freeze to my stick.  plus the hail was beating a stinging little tattoo on my skin and my nose kept running.  

By the end of the game, I was a frozen little ball of self-pity.

So I come home, take a hot bath, eat much too much food, take a nap underneath about twenty quilts, and swath myself in a bathrobe and other thick and fuzzy clothes but I'm still not warm.  (My ball of self-pity has not yet thawed, but I'm done for now.)

We won the game 16-2, by the way.

Lacrosse had good and bad days, at least for me.  A few weeks ago we went to Cleveland to play, which turned out to be amazing for two reasons.  first, we stayed in a hotel.  there are few things in this world I love more than hotels, even dirty ones.  I collect their shampoo.  Although apparently I kept rolling over and hitting Liz in the face, and she kept having to push me away.  this remind me suspiciously on the ""encroaching"" business with Audrey.

Second, I played well in our last game.  That one game reminded me why I play sports: I love the rush, the narrowing of the whole world to just me and the ball.  I was so happy that whole day (minus a little run-in with my father).

In other news:  there really is no other news.  I'm just updating so I don't have to write my 5 summaries for English.  

Work has been fun, although somewhat draining.  it's a long story as to why.  

oh god, I need to decide where to go to college!  ::panic attack and nervous fluttering ensue::

Pirates of Penzance was AWESOME!  Everyone in it was very good, and the lights and program and everything else Susan and Katelyn and the crew did were great, but I have to say that Mark blew me away.  He was just so good.

"event","I just returned from Cleveland... I'll only be in Pittsburgh for a day before I go back.  John and Sue (Audrey's parents, who took me there) said I might as well just stay.  I didn't really do anything in Cleveland this time around, just sleep and see Aud, but John's hysterically funny and kept making jokes about encasing his head in metal.  so it was good.  Although there was a lot of church going.

the churchgoing was to be expected, because it's Easter and also the whole pont of me going was seeing Audrey get confirmed. 
 
Susan and I are going again on Tuesday to see John Carroll University (her first time, my third).  I'm excited: partly to see the school, partly to spend time with Susan, but mostly because I'm missing school AND lacrosse.

I've been eating chocolate steadily all day.

I keep thinking of the last scene of Ella Enchanted and laughing... also new names for Dr. Naragon and his smackdown with Mr. Brezler (Dr. Justice to the rescue!!)

"event","first, a quick update: the return to school has been uneventful in the extreme.  I'd much rather be at work.  also my teachers haven't given much homework and so it's rather pointless to even go.

last weekend was the 30-hour famine, most of which I missed because I had to work on Saturday, much to the disgust of Mr. Brezler, who has been sweeping past me in a huff whenever he sees me.  oh well.  yay for sleeping in the senior lounge though, that was fun!!  

I also got my belly button pierced.  I was going to get my tongue pierced, but apparently my tongue has too many veins, so we went with the belly button.  I keep pulling up my shirt so people can see it. 

we had our first lacrosse games in the past week... I can't say I contribute much, but I feel very official standing on the field with my little skirt and stick.  the first time I put in a mothguard I put it in upside down, which nearly made me asphyxiate on my own saliva.  since then, our relationship has improved.

the following survey was stolen from Allison and is used to create the illusion of a long entry

bright swirls of paint... it's very colorful, but there are no posters of paintings

"event","it's been a very interesting week.  unfortunately, tomorrow I have to go back to school (more on that later).

Tuesday I hung out with Susan, Lara, and Katelyn... Wednesday they came to visit me at work (bearing gifts of Eat'n'Park placemats), and Wednesday night I went out with Skillet.  (Many buckets of thanks to Susan for listening to me flip out about ten million times!)

We had fun.  it was not terribly awkward, except for the part where we couldn't figure out what to do and sort of sat staring at each other for a while.  I KNEW that was going to happen.  I panicked for a second and called Lara, after which I calmed down, and so we ended up doing the standard dinner-and-a-movie.

that being said, I doubt we'll ever hang out again, unless I ask, which I'm not going to.  so... it was real while it lasted.

I don't think the gossip in our little tiny store will die quite as fast as our relationship, which never really made it off the ground. one of tim's stupid friends told my manager that we had fooled around... I had already told her the truth, but she fucked around with him and pretended she believed him, and by night shift everyone knew we had gone out.  

actually this same stupid friend keeps hitting on me.  he's the one who kept feeding me (a habit which has started again!) and calling me at odd hours (ditto).  now he's trying to buy stuff for me (I won't let him) and put his arm around me all the time.  it would be funny if it weren't so... repulsive.  that sounds mean, but... 

Thursday we left for Cincinnati, which was a fun time although a lot of the trip was spent in a car or in a hotel room.  I loved Xavier, although I got a bit of a shock when the counselor asked me how I liked Pigeon Forge High School.  And they're going to the Elite Eight!  Yay Xavier!  (Although sad for Pitt, but I knew they weren't going to go all the way).

I came back Saturday, went to work, and called Mark because it was his birthday, although he was locked out of his room. today I went shopping and saw a movie with my sister.  We saw a ""Sneak Preview"" of the Prince and Me which was AMAZING!  yeah, it's a complete chick flick but I had happy little dreamy shivers afterwards, and so did my sister.  on the way home, she said ""That was so good!"" about twenty times.  

Also today I saw Ian again for the first time since New Year's, which was great.  although it was only for a half-hour before I had to leave again.  he's changed a lot, but at the same time is much the same as I remember.  

And then tomorrow we'll be going back to school (Ian will be visiting Wednesday and Friday, which should be trippy). i don't hate school.  I know I have amazing opportunities there.  but there's not doubt I'm sick of it... to the point of nausea.  

I'd rather be at work than at school.  I'd also rather be at work than at lacrosse, or at home.   I can't quite explain it, but I always feel a little happier after work.  (Also, I got a raise!)  I truly adore everyone there.  In fact, I've been happier about everything lately.  it's a nice feeling to wake up smiling. 

Let's see... sorry this is so rambly.  next week will be busy, especially with Ian visiting (although that's a nice kind of busy).  Wednesday is my birthday!!  what I really want to do is eat dinner with my friends and watch Party Monster. Or maybe just eat dinner and have a food fight, but Lara and I will eventually have to see Party Monster.

It's raining.  I think I'll go walk in the rain.  

I could leave but I won't go
It'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
me looking at you, you looking at me
's always the same, just a shame, that's all 

That's All..."

"event","I just got home from New Orleans.  :O)  Something everyone should say at least once in their lifetime.  It's a great city, the weather was wonderful and everyone seemed very sunny and happy. There were also still beads in the trees along the parade routs from Mardi Gras. 

I slept through a great portion of my time there because I was wearing my sister's contacts, which are too strong for me and make me dizzy... there's a long story here involving thirsty cockroaches.

But anyway, I was awake to visit the campus (loyola), which was different from anywhere else I would go.  it's hard to explain, but I know that if I go there everything would be new.  this could be a good thing.  the campus is old and small but nice.  

My tour guide's name was Jesus. 

speaking of college, it seems like everyone's talking about it and thinking about it and getting ready... congratulations to Katelyn and Ian for American and Katelyn for RIT and Susan for Goucher.  I'm getting a little sniffly (but will nevertheless NOT break into nostalgia moment).

We went shopping in the French Quarter at 6 in the morning... most of the stores didn't open until nine so we just walked around and watched the city wake up.  I bought a pretty mask for me and some presents for other people... though I broke the mask first thing back in pittsburgh.  

break has been very relaxing, I get home from work and change straight into my p.j.'s and sometimes pretend to clean my room.  work is also relaxing, because we're slow during Lent and so everyone sits around and talks and cooing over Diana's baby (who sits in the break room most days).

lacrosse practice starts again monday.

Well, I thought I was over you
But I guess...maybe I'm not

"event","it's been a crazy week. 

Friday was the semi-formal, very successful by Student Council standards and also (hopefully) by student standards.  Katelyn was my date, and we exchanged short (yet meaningful!) hugs during the slow dances.  

Saturday NHS volunteered at the Center for Creative Play, which would have been cool, except we were assigned to supervise a concert of children's songs (sung slowly so those with learning disorders can sing along).  Even that would've been cool, but there were no kids.  so we all flapped our wings like birds and waddled like penguins for each other...

the Oscars were boring.  Nobody went on an anti-Bush rant, no surprise winners, no one ripped off anyone else's bra (to the best of my knowledge).  why bother if Madonna isn't making out with Julia Roberts on stage?  

although Susan and I had a good time making fun of people... especially the announcers at the beginning.  EVERYONE hated them.  ""Excuse me, are you leaning over Clint Eastwood?!""

Lacrosse started Monday.  the first thing we were supposed to do was throw the balls against the wall with our sticks and catch them.  I threw the ball against the wall, and it came back and hit me on my face.  hard.  three times in a row.  From there, though, practice had nowhere to go but up.  :O)

Plans to fly to New Orleans and Cincinnati are finalized.  I'm excited, especially for New Orleans.  whatever happens, it'll be fun.  :O)

"event","This guy just IMed me... apparently he read this poem that I wrote in eighth grade.  I forgot I had stuff posted on the Internet.  I told him that I was an extremely disturbed child, and I don't write poetry anymore.  he seemed disappointed; I think he wanted to share stories of extreme agony and teenage pain.  

When I got home from school today, I was tired, so I was going to take a half hour nap and then run my errands... but the nap ended up being more than four hours, so not only have I not done my errands, I haven't even looked at my homework.  

I decided to name my first son Gaugon (pronounced Goo-gone! an extremely useful substance).  I promise I'll send everybody a birth announcement.  :O)  

Semi is Friday.  I went shopping with Bhavani and bought the cutest outfit... it's this black tank top with lace and a red striped skirt.  and (only women can appreciate this) the whole thing was only thirty dollars, because wet seal was having a buy one, get two free sale.  (I also bought a cute gray skirt)

Ahem.  girl moment over.  

I was reading today about this weird compulsion some women have to eat chalk, dirt, cigarette butts, or whatever... stuff like that. This one women would go to drug stores and eat the subscription cards out of magazines right there in front of the rack, she craved it so badly she couldn't wait to get home.  she also liked the inked part of the card the best.   

of course, some women eat chalk and the like to lose weight.  Chalk is filling, and there are no calories... but it's CHALK!  that's taking dieting a little too far.  

I was thinking yesterday about God.  (sorry, this will be short)  My feelings about Him and His presence are far from clear, but I think God is different things to everybody.  officially, those who commit suicide are damned in God's eyes, but I find it hard to believe that one mistake will doom you to a life of hell.  I think God is not a entity as much as he's a feeling, and I believe that he's all feeling, both good and bad.  Because good and bad are part of who we are, and both lead to certain paths that I believe God intended us to take.  So, in the end, I believe that God is primarily faith and forgiveness.  and to be forgiveness, he must also be sin, because there can be no forgiveness without sin.  

the point of all this:  if God is different to everyone, what right does the church have to say that their God is the ""right"" one?  And their God doesn't like homosexuals, or suicides, or women priests, or divorce?  what right does the church have to speak for God, and tell people their God says?  I accept that there will always be people who do not, and will not, accept homosexuals.  I don't necessarily think that's right, but I'm too much my parent's daughter to not see this.  But I want everybody to be able to see that God is so much more than silly laws about marriage, but most people can't see past their own faith to see all the other images of God that exist.  And that kind of limited faith is worse than no faith at all, because God should be all-encompassing.  Faith is one of the most important parts of my life.  Everything I do, every decision I make, I believe that God is with me.  As long as I have emotions, He is with me.  Love for another person is complicated enough without people saying that their God says that it is wrong.  Everything He does has a purpose.  The God that I believe in would not have two people love each other and then turn His back on them and call it a sin.  

sorry if I offended anyone or that was too long, but I've been thinking about it for a while.

Nickia's driving instructor is suing her because he slipped and fell on their driveway.

tonight was bare necessities night.  the music was good, I love everyone in the band.  Peter was in drag, complete with fake boobs.  there was a gay couple there in matching outfits, right down to the socks.  lots of good hugs... from the band.  some strange people.  it's weird to see adults skipping.

I want a cigarette.  not really, I don't smoke, but I crave one nonetheless.  at least it wouldn't be boring.

oh, and the jason that I thought I knew... I don't.  it was the wrong one, although this one knows my jason as well.  the jason that lara and crystal know called me late thursday night and was like, ""do I know you? because a lot of people have been telling me that I do.""  to which I replied ""fhjbnsd"" because he had woken me up.  We decided that I was thinking of another jason and then I went back to bed.  

I have definitely decided to buy my dad a troll for his birthday (he won't get the reference).  my mom's was yesterday.  My gift to her is finding out if we can install automatic doors in her car (does anyone know is this is possible?)

I miss Audrey.  her spring break is soon, but it's during our finals.  

There's a new, sudden surge of interest in the effect of the taco bell deep fryer on human flesh.  we have a test subject as well.

this entry doesn't even make sense, it's sort of just my thoughts, random as they are right now.

"event","my mom was mad at me for getting home late... not so much for getting home late, actually, but I got home and jumped in the shower right when she was planning on getting the shower.  of course, I didn't know that, but subconciously I was obviously trying to ruin her life and all chances of happiness.  So while I'm in the shower, she bursts into the bathroom, and pulled back the shower curtain to yell at me.  I screamed and pulled it shut again.

It was scary how much reality paralleled my dream from a few months ago... the one where I was showering in school and Mr. Graca came in, pulled back the shower curtain, and told me to take baths instead because I was wasting WT's water.  

Every time I dream, it's about school.  I think my subconcious is telling me to get a life.  I had the weirdest dream last night... Rajiv and I skipped human bio to go to calc class, and Mr. Jones was angry and I'm pretty sure he had us arrested.  

I love my project for human bio.  I haven't done that much research, but I'm including the lives of inanimate objects for sure. this one woman hated her car... and one day at the grocery store, the engine started itself, it was thrown into reverse, and ran the woman over.  the car was circling for 15 minutes before rescuers could retrieve the woman (who was very dead at that point). Was the car getting revenge?  no one will ever know! 

I ordered 23 books and 2 DVDs from the library today.  yay!  they'll all probably trickle in through the next few weeks.

I saw 50 First Dates yesterday with Katelyn and Susan.  They didn't like it much... I did, though.  I'll admit there were some really bad parts... Adam Sandler should never have to cry.  Ever.  We went to Eat'n'Park with Mark and Lara afterwards.  we gossiped about livejournals until Mark had to leave the table.  then we talked about men.  Katelyn didn't say much, as she was suffering from a sore throat and sounded like ""a mix between a teenage boy going through puberty and a horse.""

nothing else to say, except this week is going to be really hard.

"event","school sucks.  my research paper sucks.  and that is all I have to say about THAT.

today was my first day ever playing lacrosse, and I was crazy confused, but it was exhilarating.  I've never played a team sport besides basketball (which reminds me, I was done with basketball, and now we have a !#%& game against the faculty!) and everyone was so nice about me being so clueless. if I did anything right at all (or even something not exactly right, but I was trying), everyone cheered... even the other team. :O) we're playing in a sort of preseason league; tonight we played Shaler and next week we play Oakland Catholic.  I like defense, which as far as I can tell involves holding your stick up above your head and running after your man, both of which I can do.  We beat Shaler 16-1.  

Lacrosse is the first thing in a long time that I've been excited about.  I'm not depressed or anything, just extremely bored with the same old same old.  Which is why I applied to Loyola University New Orleans at the last minute, and also why when I got accepted today I told my dad that I'll probably go there.  New Orleans will certainly be a change of pace... I'm a little worried about the weather.  I don't like heat, but I like the cold even less.  My hair actually froze into little sticks the other day when I was taking out the trash!

Erin and I have been really busy with NHS stuff.  we have to organize the 30-hour famine, which already has about a bijillion  complications that I'm not going to go into.  

Student Council is also busy with ClassCapades (next up: basketball!) and semi.  I did ask someone to semi, he said no, partly because he's not really the school dance type (think: strip joint).  Katelyn's advice was to keep trying until essentially my pride is ground into little shards of dust on the floor.  

it's possible to really love someone, and still be really tired of them.

All the middle school boys are in love with Lizzy.  They follow her around, talk about her, and try to take her picture while we're in metal class.  Mrs. Skiba maintains that it's because her pants are too low and her shirts are too high.  our whole class got into an argument about midriffs: is it attractive or no?  should we all wear pants up to our belly buttons?  This ended up with Lizzy arguing against herself.  Mr. Fetter was cracking up.

I want to turn 18 soon so I can get my tongue pierced.  I could do it now, my dad said that he ""encouraged"" it, which was surprising.  I think he's hoping that it will get infected and my tongue will rot off... that will teach me to be rebellious!  Ha!  

four day weekend! YAY!  Susan and Katelyn-- we should do something.  something exciting that does not involve death or school.  call me.  :O)

I slept over at Susan's last night, after I was done with work.  Mark was there too, but he was only awake for a short period of time, when we ate cheery cordial ice cream and lay on Susan's kitchen floor.  Mostly Susan and I revealed all our deep meaningful secrets (I fell asleep in the middle of our conversation though).  we also watched ""Four Rooms"" which contained a lot of needless nudity and also some not-funny jokes.

Voices came out on Friday.  I was happy because there was an article about me (the headline was ""Captain Ruth"") and an article by me.

I did have to do chores, and unfortunately I was home when my interim grades arrived.  My dad was furious, but I sang a Beatle song at him (""Getting Better"") and started giggling, which caused him to storm out of the room but later he calmed down a lot.  anyway, it was a good day.  

I had an appointment with the eye doctor, and she dilated my pupils, which was scary because I was driving home.  So I steered my way through the freezing rain at about 5mph, with yellow dye gooped in the corners of my eyes, and my perception of everything curiously out of wack.  

Work last night was fun.  I always finish stories, have someone be like, ""and...?""  and then admit that was the end.  

I read the weirdest book ever a couple days ago.  I thought it was a romance novel, but it was about this guy who died and then came back to life with psychic powers.  there was a vietnamese drug cartel, a cat ghost, an actual ghost, three witches, and a man who time traveled forward from the Middle Ages and carried a broadsword.  they were all involved in this international conspiracy technology thing.  it was very strange...

"event","Today was my senior recognition game.  I'm quite literally still crying.  Basketball was less important to me this year than it ever has been before, but it used to consume me: quite literally, all I ever thought about or cared about was basketball.  so this year I went in more laid back, which was good, because if I had cared as much I would have been an insane basket case.  There was always so much shit to deal with.  Every day, someone would come up to me and complain.  

EVERY DAY.

do you realize how much complaining that is?

I had complaining of my own, but I learned to keep it inside.  to me, it never felt like we played hard.  we either won by a lot or lost by a lot.  there were no close fights, nothing really challenging.  I wish there had been, because I played lazy this season.  Not in the not-hustling way, in the well-what's-the-fucking-point because we're going to lose anyway way.  and so I didn't really improve, because I didn't care.  I had fun playing basketball exactly once this season, and that was playing a pick-up game during winterim.  I played point guard that game, and I can't really dribble, but it was amazing.  and I played better too.  

basketball used to be fun every day.  maybe I'm just getting older, and I care less and less, but it's a huge relief that it's finally over. it's not that I'm not sad, because I am.  If there was one thing in the past 4 years that taught me about my life and myself, it was basketball.  that's actually what I wrote my college essay about.  I'm not really much of an athlete, I had to decide to be good at basketball and then I had to do it.  I was never really a hard worker before that.  not to mention that I was about thirty pounds overweight.  so basketball taught me to push myself, and one of the things that I like best about myself is that I'm determined.  

basketball is one of the biggest time drains there is.  a home game, if we're lucky, chews up four hours, usually more (bc of varsity and jv games).  I never regretted the time, I don't think I ever will.  it's never been hard for me to make time for something that I love.  and even though plenty of the memories I have are bad, there are a lot of good ones too, and those are the ones that pushed me through the season.  that and a lot of naps.

in any case, now I'm done.  basketball, from here on out, can only be a minimal part of my life, but that doesn't mean that I won't ermember the past four seasons with love.

thanks Susan and Mark for coming and yelling at me (not in the cheering way, either).  especially Susan, because you know what it's like.  ;o)

I'm still not sure how they did it, since I am certainly not a performer, especially compared to them.  but I am so glad that they did! (special thanks to Mark and Nickia)  I had so much fun.  we did ""Like a Virgin"" from the VMA's, and we even included the kiss between Britney and Madonna (me and Mark).  I was so nervous beforehand that I quite literally made myself sick.  I was crying in metal.  Afterwards, though, it was all good.  I rode a huge adrenalin right up to the beginning of our game, and then it died.  

The game sucked.  no other word for it.  I'm tired of losing, but nobody has the energy or motivation for anything else.  we did win yesterday, however!  it was a good game (against WPSD).

My grandpa comes to all our games on the bus now.  I'm not quite sure how to act around him.  I don't want to baby him, but he can't do a lot of stuff by himself.  And although it feels terrible, sometimes I resent him always being present when I need a little space.

I was walking the dog, and although the snow is lovely, the sidewalks were covered in shiny slippery sheets (how's that for alliteration?!) of ice.  my dog dragged me effortlessly down a large hill in pursuit of a demon squirrel.  it was like ice-skating, only on my butt.  the snow looks fake and plastic with the shimmery ice cover.  it looks like what people want snow to look like in cheap Christmas decorations.

the basketball season is going to continue even LONGER because we have to make up the game we missed yesterday because of snow. I told Mr. Miller, ""Let's not and say we did.""  I love basketball, I love watching and playing and talking about it.  I do NOT love the WT girl's team, however.

Susan is going to make me a mix CD of Backstreet Boys and *N Sync.  this makes me ebullient (not just happy... ebullient!).  I was tired of working out to matchbox 20

it's a lot harder to write these things than it looks. fellow voyeurs, beware!! and to those of you who haven't updated... *cracks whip*... I'm watching you."

"event","*sigh*  I guess I knew it had to happen someday, I read so many other people's blogs (see username... thank you, Katelyn!) that eventually I was going to have to make one of my own.  I guess it's not that bad of a thing, because you can write about yourself and ramble and not feel bad about talking exclusively about yourself.  On the flip side, this is so public (nobody knows this better than myself.  see username again).  Hopefully Katelyn will continue Ruth's corner every so often, though, because that's the best thing in the world.

So, this weekend was fun.  I guess.  we had a game on Friday, yes we lost, but that's to be expected.  In the locker room, Coach Elise asked us if we went into games expecting to lose.  the obvious answer is ""Hell Yeah.""  nobody said that, though.  I got six amazing bruises, which I check about every five minutes to see if they've gotten bigger.  :O)  yay!  we have four games next week, it makes me tired just to think about.

Saturday I had work (busy), and then went to Molly's house for her Johnny Depp party.  the movies were good (we watched seven!), Johnny Depp is hot, but most importantly the food was yummy.  I love food.  Don't ever let me say that I don't. 

Today was very quiet.  I spent most of it napping and avoiding coach don's phone calls, because he's mad at me.  he left about ten angry, sputtering messages.  I would have turned my phone off, but I was waiting for another call. :OP  

I feel like I'm thirteen again (possibly 12).  it's so weird to have a crush on someone.  it's fun too, I've always liked being caught in the guessing games.  Susan can testify to this.  :O)  I don't like relationships, though.  he's a cool person, completely off-the-wall crazy but cool nonetheless.  we'll see how it goes.  I have no idea what he thinks of me.  

sleep now.  maybe I'll post again later.  maybe not."

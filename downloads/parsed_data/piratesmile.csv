Shelby and I happened upon the anime club today and watched two hours of anime.  Classes start on monday :-|  I'm not sure how I feel about the classes I'm taking.  They're both writing classes so I'll probably write more papers in the next six weeks than I did in my high school career.  well thats about all there is to say.  Arrivederci.

"event","The musical has consumed all of my time.  I haven't been able to enjoy my freedom (being done with the audition) because of it.  A bunch of people are going to Allie's house tonight but i'm definitely not invited.  It really sucks.  Elizabeth and Amanda keep talking about it but apparently there's a limit for how many people can actually go and I would put them over the limit.  I love it when friends do bitchy stuff like that.  I mean, it doesn't really matter if Elizabeth goes or not because we're not that close but I'm surprised neither Amanda nor Olivia stepped in and said something.  I guess i just can't really imagine talking about a party in front of a good friend knowing damn well that they're not invited.  Of course it's way too much to expect that either one of them would offer to hang out with me instead of going to this awesome party.  
That's all I really have to say now.  I think i'll take my bruised ego somewhere else."

"event","I've finally broken the fever!  No, i'm not sick (not physically anyway) but my body has managed to break free off the Lexapro.  I'm on the medicine and still wondering why the hell I'm not getting ""enough"" out of life.  I was thinking how much it would suck to be such a moral person that you never really lived.  Or even worse, if you were corrupt that you lost your soul completely.  Doesn't corporate America make you want to vomit?  I don't understand people that can go through the motions of living but never real feel life.  Luckily not everyone is like that but I have discovered that most people are truely shallow.  They merely have so much chaos and ""drama"" in their lives they make people believe they have some kind of depth.  

Now for a rather abrupt subject change:  Today I was wondering what it be like to cease to exist.  What if people in our lives were obliterated?  What if ever aspect and memory of a person was destroyed and you never knew they existed in the first place.  You wouldn't miss them, you couldn't since having no memory of them, you never knew them in the first place.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  

One last comment:  I've decided not to cut my hair for a while.  I want to see exactly how long I can stand it.  

Now it is time to write an english outline."

"event","Today is definitely one of those lazy sundays.  I was supposed to have orchestra pit rehearsal but Mr. Campbell cancelled it so now I'm sitting here wondering whether or not I want to start homework.  Office Space is one of the funniest movies ever.  

My flight last night was amazing.  The sunset took my breath away.  The plane was way up above the clouds and when I looked down I saw something that looked like a sea of cotton balls.  You could see the north star perfectly despite the burning orange that faintly lit the western sky.  When the plane descended, we spent about five mintues in the clouds.  There was maybe 20 feet visibility.  Night flights are incredible.  

As much as I hate to admit it, homework calls me.

As for my Mozart concerto.... oh well, can't win 'em all.  One of the judges asked what other schools I'm applying to and I told her none.  They then looked at each other like I was completely crazy so now i'm wondering if i should have made up some schools or something.  This is extrememly vexing.

"event","My audition is on Saturday.  I'm already nervous.  This can't be good.  

I haven't really updated in a while so i guess I should let you guys know how i'm doing.  I'm back on the antidepressants which is upsetting.  I thought I was capable of working things out on my own and that I was past needing medication.  Apparently not.  Dr.Cooper doesn't think it's ""normal"" for me to feel like I need more out of life.  She also says I have problems with intimacy and so my ""assignment"" is to figure out why.  

Orchestra is going well.  I think i broke someone's heart but there's nothing I can really do about that.  One girl's viola was smashed about 20 minutes before Sunday's concert.  It wasn't a pretty sight.  If anything happened to Gabriel I think I would go in a state of shock.  

I found out today that no one in my strings group has a name for their instruments.  It's quite tragic.  

Oh yes, one more thing.  Dr.Cooper thinks it's a little unnatural for someone my age to be so adamant about getting her tubes tied.  What do my not so avid readers think?  Is this truly a problem?

That about sums up all I have to say for now.  Beloved friends rest assured that I'm not on the verge of killing myself.  Everything is ok.  The safety net of Lexapro is up again and we may all sleep a little easier knowing that."

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/D/donarepa/1065683791_ampirequiz.JPG"" border=""0"" alt=""vamp""><br>You are Form 9, <b>Vampire</b>: The Undying.

<i>&quot;And The Vampire was all that remained on<br>the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to<br>regrow life from the dead.  But as she was<br>about to give the breath of life, she was<br>consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the<br>cycle began again.&quot;</i>

Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek)<br>and Isis (Egyptian).
The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.

As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic<br>individual.  You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times.  While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

not much else happened today.  Orchestra has been interesting to say the least.  My conductor wants us to perform at the Atlanta Symphony Celebration.  I think he may be insane.  We only have brandenburg (#3) at an acceptable level. I don't think we're ready to play the first mvt of Tchaikovsky serenade for strings or Hoe Down.  But he is the one in charge and knows what hes doing. I should stop questioning him.  

School has been ok.  I love the independent study that i'm doing and strings has been wonderful.  Mr.Smith (strings teacher) is a lot younger than Campbell (band teacher) and yet seems to be the superior teacher.  I'm sick of music history.  Campbell thinks i'm the worst musician my school has ever seen.  I'll prove him wrong though.  I'll come back to pace and play some incredible concerto and dedicate it to ""Mr.campbell, the teacher that never believed in me...."" ok, enough venting!  i'll stop boring the avid readers i don't have.  
So the 6 hours of testing i went through has fried my brain :)  I think its time to get some sleep.

I'll update again sometime later today when i don't have to study for a music history quiz... Gotta love the Renaissance.  I'm currently making faces at my friend Nick.  I think he's scared.  
   I'm listening to my favorite symphony (well currently my favorite)  The Moldau by Smetana.  The strings part on this takes the listener and plays with every one of their emotions.  
   Ok well it's off to band for me!  The flute just isn't as cool as the violin (sorry if I have offended anyone) and i would much rather be in strings right now.  After band is an hour of music theory and then an hour of music history.  Being a senior is great, i never realized how much choosing your own classes can affect wether or not you like school.

"event","I think my house is haunted.  I will not bore you guys with the details from the past but I will say that tonight i've seen some weird stuff that I havent seen in about five years.  I was sitting at the kitchen table working on homework when all of a sudden the radio came on.  Its not on an alarm clock and doesnt even have a feature to turn itself on.  It was strange and although the dogs were no where near the radio or the remote I figured they must have played a part in it (no one else was here to blame).  So I turned it off with and when I was satisfied it wasn't going to come back on I started to walk away.  Well I only made it five steps and then it turned back on even louder, this time scanning the stations and stopping periodically (it wasn't like a normal radio scan where it spends equal amounts of time on each station).  this freaked me out so i just turned the tv on so that our lovely, possessed bose system wouldnt even deal with the radio.  This was a little freaky yet one could still blame it on the mysteries of electronics.  But the next thing that happened cannot fall under the category of unpredictable machines.  
	As I was walking to the laundry room I heard something coming from the bathroom.  No one ever uses this bathroom so i was confused as to what would be making any noise.  I opened the bathroom door and the faucet was running.  Not dripping mind you, turned up and running.  It would be ok if there was someone to blame it on, but i've been the only one here besides the dogs, and even if they tried, the sink is too high for them to reach.  i turned the faucet off and with the feeling that one gets from a bad scary movie when you want to tell the main character to get away from the closet which is concealing the scary man with a chain saw....  Its obviously not that bad but it made me get the hell away from the laundry room area.  
	So now I sit hear at the kitchen table listening to knocking sounds being emmited from my closed bedroom door.  Yes, its loud enough to reach the downstairs.  Anyway, like I said before this stuff hasn't happened since about five years ago so i'm a little edgy.  I should be used to it but time has a way of making you forget.  
	I think i'll go figure out why really cold air is blowing around this room since its not coming from the ac vents.  theres no air coming from them at all.  This is so WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","I haven't updated in forever and a half.  For this, I apologize.  this will be short and sweet though.  I am merely passing time as i wait for the ok to call someone.  I owe him a huge email that was sitting in my inbox but has disappeared and i'm too frustrated to start over just yet.  I thought, since i'm not in a lengthy writing mood, I would just post one of my favorite poems.  Its Litany by Billy Collins.

Litany


You are the bread and the knife,
The crystal goblet and the wine...
-Jacques Crickillon


You are the bread and the knife,
the crystal goblet and the wine.
You are the dew on the morning grass
and the burning wheel of the sun.
You are the white apron of the baker,
and the marsh birds suddenly in flight.

However, you are not the wind in the orchard,
the plums on the counter,
or the house of cards.
And you are certainly not the pine-scented air.
There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air.

It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge,
maybe even the pigeon on the general's head,
but you are not even close
to being the field of cornflowers at dusk.

And a quick look in the mirror will show
that you are neither the boots in the corner
nor the boat asleep in its boathouse.

It might interest you to know,
speaking of the plentiful imagery of the world,
that I am the sound of rain on the roof.

I also happen to be the shooting star,
the evening paper blowing down an alley
and the basket of chestnuts on the kitchen table.

I am also the moon in the trees
and the blind woman's tea cup.
But don't worry, I'm not the bread and the knife.
You are still the bread and the knife.
You will always be the bread and the knife,
not to mention the crystal goblet and--somehow--the wine.

Billy Collins


Something about that poem... 
anyway I'm back in school now, but thats ok because i'm taking a ton of music classes.  That makes it bearable.  I'll update more when i'm not so tired."

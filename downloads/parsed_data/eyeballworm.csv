I don't like this either, but it'll have to do for now. <br /><br />It's not going too great at school. I skip too many classes, to be exact 125 since the beginning of the year. I heard this yesterday when I had a talk with my class mentor. I don't know what I want anymore. I don't want this either, but I just cannot set myself to going to school. I feel kinda horrible about it I must admit. I'm not going to write much on here now, I've already missed one class today.. <br /><br />Anyway, I got something new to focus on. Another new species to add to my ever growing animal family lol. I'm getting... hermit crabs!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""http://static.flickr.com/140/321137533_cc6d3fbd7e_o.gif"" alt="""" /><br />I think they're awesome! Unfortunately they're not too common around here, not like in the US where they sell them things on local markets, Home Depot, nearly all the different pet stores etc. <br />This sunday I'm going to the Houten reptile show again, where I can hopefully find a couple of those little buggers.. <br /><br />For those of you who don't have a clue what a hermit crab is.. <a href=""http://www.crabbytalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/purplepincherhermitcrab.jpg"">Click!</a>"

"event","So I got back home from the festival 2 days ago, and now I'm a bit rested and in my old pattern again. I won't bore you with the whole story, but there are a couple of things that should be said about CUNTING Earthshaker fest! <br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"">We drove off around 7ish, way too early for me! Gerjan, Matthijs, Daniel the driver and me, all cramped up in an English Peugeot 406. The ride wasn't all that bad (I bet Dan disagrees on this point). We had a nice view all the way, Germany is actually quite lovely! <br /><br /><img src=""http://img93.imageshack.us/img93/5213/dscf0013nv2.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />On our way we got pulled over bei der Polizei, and one of the nice policemen decided to give Dan some head.. Quite a nice intervention I thought. <br /><br /><img src=""http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/2969/dscf0015ta5.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Thanks to our Tomtom Kate, we never missed an exit and drove straight to Kreuth, the little town where the festival was held. There, we didn't waste any time setting up our tents, even though it was too hot to think right! <br /><img src=""http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/1120/dscf0017eo3.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />To make a long story short, here are some pictures of bands and us on the campsite. <br /><br /><font size=""1"">Satyricon<br /><img src=""http://img162.imageshack.us/img162/8831/dscf0040uq9.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img src=""http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/2562/dscf0031xt5.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Matthijs.. bit sunburnt..<br /><img src=""http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/7850/dscf0046ca7.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Cronos of Venom at the signing session..

<br />Yesterday Dan, Matthijs and me went to Deventer to do a bit of shopping. I came home with 3 gerbil boys! They're the loveliest ever and I'm having so much fun just watching them go about and enjoying themselves. I've named them Batzorig, Batkhuyag and Mungentuya, Mongolian names for Mongolian gerbils.. Seems appropriate, doesn't it.. <br /><br />I'll shut up now.. I NEED TO get to bed.. *yawn*"

"event","Another one of my sleepless nights! No, not because I'm too excited about leaving for Earthshaker fest. It's now 4.30 pm and I think I'm skipping tonight as a whole. 

Today was fun actually. Didn't do much until after dinner. Dan arrived in Zwolle around 6 pm, and he drove to my place after he'd set up his tent. At 9 I had a job interview with the local animal ambulance, which went great! I had an email in my inbox a couple of hours later, saying they welcome me to the team! 
After the interview Dan and I went to eat some frigginhells (frikandellen, just a chunk of meat really) and drove off to see Matthijs. We decided to do some more sightseeing, and went to the next town where we met up with Gijs, Sanne and Nienke (around 11). We went to Sanne's place and had a couple of drinks before going back to drop off everyone. We had some good laughs, mostly about Dan's peculiar piercings. 
After dropping me off here, Dan and I had a bit of a chat and he went back to the campsite in Zwolle. 

And now I'm sitting here, pondering my gerbil-setup. I'm so into getting a pair of gerbils these days. I've got a nice tank set up and with some slight modifications they can move in! Just have to find somebody to sell them to me lol!"

We're now halfway our test week and I've had 5 tests so far, 4 to go this week and 3 next week. The only test I had today was German language, at 11 am. The bitch scheduled me for 2 pm for the oral exams!! Bloody hell.. Still an hour of doing bloody nothing here. 

I had my first grade back today.. 6.6/10 for Dutch language! Also my literature essays have been approved. I screwed up maths pretty badly.. I expect a 1,5/10 at most. I'm not sure on my economics, but since my teacher hates my guts I don't expect that to be any good as well. Same goes for the economics essay.&nbsp; 

Yesterday I took some pics of my spiders outside, they will be in a book about tarantulas that is being written at the moment! I want to put them up here but can anybody tell me where the bloody hell the ""add-picture""-button went??"

"event","Ugh.. what an exhausting couple of days!! I'm at school at the moment, nearly falling asleep.&nbsp;<br />On saturday I fell asleep halfway during the day until dinner, so I was completely rested and didn't feel tired whatsoever by the time I had to go to bed. Around 3 AM my mom and grandma went to bed but I was still very much awake. Since I had to&nbsp;get up at 6 AM for the&nbsp;Dutch&nbsp;Tarantula Society&nbsp;meeting I decided not to go to bed and risk falling asleep and not waking up in time (very me).&nbsp;<br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" style="""">Around 8 AM I arrived at the train station where I met up with Matthijs. At 8:10 our train left for Deventer where we were to meet Eddy. After about an hour in the car we arrived in Harmelen where we had to wait for about an hour.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jan arrived very shortly after us, and got all the spiders we bought from him out of the car. Some seemed to be already dead, such a shame! He just didn't care for them in the past couple of weeks. Matthijs and I sorted out which spiders belonged to who and after that the meeting started. <br />The meeting was actually quite a lot of fun. We said goodbye to the founder of the DTS and offered a special membership. Nicole had a huge cake made. After a couple of stories of the founder we had a break and the possibility to exchange some spiders. I bought 2 Psalmopoeus cambridgei from Gijsbert!! So cute.&nbsp;<br /><br />After that there was a lecture by Martin Nicholas. He told us about a documentary he made about tarantulas for the American market. We also watched a couple of fragments from that show. I'm seriously thinking about importing the dvd from the States, since it probably won't ever be on tv or dvd here. <br />The guy was very much fun to listen to, all in all a great lecture!&nbsp;<br /><br />I took home:<br /><br />0.0.2 Acanthognathus francki<br />0.0.1 Acanthoscurria geniculata<br />0.1.0 Brachypelma angustum (got it for free from Eddy)&nbsp;<br />0.1.0 Chilobrachys sp.&nbsp; ""Guangxiensis""&nbsp;<br />1.0.0 Grammostola rosea<br />0.0.1 Haplopelma albostriatum<br />0.0.1 Haplopelma minax<br />0.0.2 Psalmopoeus cambridgei<br /><br />I was nearly dead by the time I got home.&nbsp;<br />I decided to mate the male G. rosea I got immediately. Went great! The&nbsp;male had his bulbs in for at least 3 minutes!&nbsp;So now I'm due for a +- 7 month wait for a sac.. ugh..&nbsp;<br /><br />As I said, I was a total wreck when I got home. But the day wasn't over yet.. noooo. My friend Klaas had his birthday yesterday and of course we had to go there aswell. So another 7 km by bike and back.. aaagh! I nearly fell asleep on the way back!&nbsp;<br />Back home I managed to rehouse the 2 Haplo's and the Chilo (not the best idea, me being dozy and the spiders being fast as hell).&nbsp;<br /><br />Then I crashed...<br /><br /><br />PS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare you mental if you've read the whole story!! <br /></div>

There's this party now to which I should be going but I don't want to and now I upset Matthijs.. I start crying whilst writing this. What the hell is wrong with me?!

"event","I've been a bit down lately.. I worry too much I guess. About my education, about my dad's health, about my weight.. Everything bugs me. That's probably why I haven't put much up here for a while. It's finally cooled off though, that's one burden less. Absolutely hate the temperatures of the last couple of days! Basil, the mouse I got a week or so ago, died because of the heat and I'm very lucky the spiders that decided to molt during the heat didn't get stuck in their skins. <br />One good thing today was that I got an email from a guy who's sending me a couple of Holconia immanis slings! Yay! <br /><br />I'm gonna work on this LJ layout a bit now.. Looks a bit boring at the mo.<br />

"event","So yeah, that took me a while!! 
Haven't really done much lately and didn't feel like posting anything up here, shoot me! 


So what's new in my life.. uhh.. nothing much really. Been selling some of my spiders because I've grown very allergic to the urticating hairs on American species. So I'm getting rid of a couple and getting some Asian species to replace them. Next sunday is the largest reptile show in the Netherlands (Houten) and I'm picking up a couple of very nice spideys there!
Avicularia versicolor (to help out a friend) subadult female, Haplopelma hainanum and lividum slings and a Haplopelma longipes juvenile! Possibly more, depends on what I sell before sunday and the amount of money I get for them. 

I've also put a reserve on 2 new mice! A little boy and girl I named Meri and Mika. I will pick them up some day next week and surely I'll put up some pics here. 

I'm getting a headache now... Since 8 am this morning a painter has started scraping down the paint on our house. Not a very nice sound to start the day with! This will probably go on for about a week, bloody hell..

Oh well, got to go dig up some pillbugs for a practical exam for biology today.."

"event","Finally I'm awake enough to start writing down something on here. I got home around 2 last night which is rather late for me, half drunk and almost deaf so I took my time to rest lol.<br />Had a lot of fun last night though, went to my first concert in months. <br /><br />First up was Aggro. Nice sound, very loud and quite fast, but boy that singer's nuts! I really can't believe the amount of energy that guy's wasting on stage in such a short period of time. Jumping, kicking, screaming, grunting.. freak ass weirdo! I'm not too much into his vocal style, and I'd personally like the band much more with another vocalist..<br /><br />
<div align=""center""><img src=""http://www.aggromusic.com/jaws/html/data/phoo/2006_04_17/medium/DSCF0393.JPG"" alt="""" /></div>
<br />After that, Evidence. Never heard of these guys before. Musically they were great! Quite rough, but very nice. But again, the vocals. HORRIBLE!! I think they're better of with ME on the vocals than they are with him. Not a band I'd want to see again if they hang on to this guy. Pity, because they're good musicians! (No pic)<br /><br />As headliner, there was Devious! Now we're talking. I hadn't seen this band for quite a while, say a year or 2. Their former singer Arnold is now replaced by a new guy (with hair, lol) who has quite a voice! The all-over sound and performance were good, no comment whatsoever. I like Devious, I guess I should get the dust off the cd I have of those guys..<br />The new cd with the new singer should appear somewhere in the summer if I understood it right. <br /><br />

So I waited for him that evening but he didn't get online. I tried to contact him over the weeks, called him and emailed but I couldn't get in touch. I got more and more worried, and yesterday I had had too much. 
I opened a thread on a forum of which I know he's a member, and I got in contact with a friend of Dan in the Netherlands. He gave me the number of his house phone and I called him there. I was SO relieved to hear his voice again, ruling out one of the things I was worried about. I must have shocked him quite a bit since I started crying my eyes out. I care so much for that guy.."

Around 7.30 I went back home with my new additions in my backpack. 12 In total! 

1.1.2 Grammostola porteri
1.1.0 Grammostola rosea rcf
0.1.0 Grammostola rosea ""Concepcion""
0.0.5 Eupalaestrus campestratus

When I got back home I put them all in their new enclosures to settle in. If today brings more sun I'll take them out in the back yard to take some pictures. After rehousing the spiders I went to take care of my other critters, and found out that the baby harvest mice were born!! I haven't actually seen them, but the female is half the size she was lol.

"event","..pondering what has happened over the week. That's usually what I do on a sunday after I've taken care of all my pets. I've skipped school the whole week exept for thursday. I just couldn't force myself to go this time. Figured I needed something to cheer me up since I'm really down these days, so I got the piercing done which is great and actually did cheer me up a bit. 
Friday was altogether very much fun. Spent the whole day at the pub with an old friend (Hanneke) and some other people. Hanneke called me saturday morning to meet up and she arrived at my place around 1 pm. She wanted to see all of my critters and we watched ""The long weekend"". Around 4 pm she left and saturday night Klaas and Marinka picked me up to go to Matthijs (my boyfriend). Watched a film there too, but can't recall the tilte. Something with ashes.. About a Jewish female doctor at Auschwitz. Was pretty cool. 

Today I've slept late, cleaned up the rodent cages as I do every sunday and checked on the mice I thought to be pregnant. My mouse Rhosyn seems pregnant, she's got a very fat tummy! Also, the female harvest mouse seems pregnant (they're so small you can hardly tell), so in a matter of days I should have some additions to the family here! 

Ah well, another one of my boring weekends. Great."

I'm not gonna tell my mother yet, she'll find out when I have it. Should be a nice surprise!"

"event","So last night the housewarming party wasn't too much fun. I didn't feel good at all, the room was filled with cigarette smoke and it was altogether pretty boring. At the end of the evening I found myself reading the latest Donald Duck issue. <br />The whole night left me considering something that had left my head a long time ago; whether or not to get a labret piercing in the middle of my lower lip. I've always wanted that done, but either I wasn't old enough or didn't have the money to get it done. Now I'm 19 my parents have little say in the matter, and money isn't that big a problem either. A friend I saw at the party had it done yesterday, which put the thought of it right back in my head. <br />So why not do it you'd think.. <br />Well, I know my parents won't like it, I'm not sure it'll look good on me and my boyfriend despises piercings in the face. Back to thinking things over..<br /><br />Which reminds me of the fact that I've never put any pictures of myself on here. That has probably a great deal to do with the fact that I don't like to have my picture taken. Once, I've made an exeption on my rule of never getting photographed, which was during the makeup for the promo of George A. Romero's 'Land of the Dead', that was released in cinemas last summer. <br /><br />

"event","Had a nice day off, since it's Good Friday and everything. That's one of the few things Christians are good at; getting off for celebrations. 

This morning after I got up I had to rid my door of all the sticker residue because my mum wants to re-paint them. That task made sure I had a nice headache all day, I spent about an hour above a can of benzine. 
After that my boyfriend and me got on the train and went to Deventer, where Eddy was picking us up. When we got there, it appeared that Eddy came by foot, so we had a nice long walk ahead of us. We spent the afternoon watching a German dvd of some people searching for tarantulas in Colombia. It was pretty nice, seeing Xenesthis immanis and such just sitting there by the side of a road. 

After that we headed for the pub in Almelo, where I used to spend quite a few hours a week. There were a couple of people I know, but nothing really interesting to do there so we decided to head home. On the way back to the station I dropped in a store to buy a couple of plastic containers for the tarantulas that arrive next week. Back home, I decided to put a couple of smaller tarantulas I already have in the plastic containers, so that the new adult tarantulas have a nice tank set up when they get here.

Yesterday I've emailed a film company on a film I'd like to have. It's about my family, my great-grandmother and her kids. A dramatic documentary on helping Jews in the 2nd World War.
It was released in 1988, made by the son of one of the Jews that my great-grandmother saved.
It's probably never been put on tape or dvd, so I hope I can still get a copy.

Now I'm just sitting here, pondering whether I'm going to watch ""The Bunker"" tonight or not. I'm not sure yet."

"event","Tonight I'm going to a reading about the book ""Sonny Boy"" written by Annejet van der Zijl. I haven't actually read the book, but my mum has and she wanted me to go with her. My Dutch teacher recommended it to the class and I told him that there was a reading, so I won't be surprised if he turns up aswell. 
The book is about the relationship between a black man and a white married woman. She gets pregnant with him, divorces her husband, can never see her kids again. Basically about a love that wasn't meant to be, but still happened.

This weekend should be pretty good. Tomorrow I'm going to see a friend who's also very much into tarantulas, to collect an adult male that he got for breeding loan from my boyfriend. I wonder if he's got any nice spiders for sale that I can bring home, I'll have to remind myself to bring some cash.. 
Not that I'm short on tarantulas or anything. Right now there are about 40 eightlegged critters in the room with me, and there are a couple on the way. I've ordered 3 species from Germany that should arrive here by the end of next week. 2 breeding couples and 15 spiderlings to raise or sell, I'm not sure what I'll do with them yet. 

Saturday night I'm going to a housewarming party from my cousin. He moved a couple of weeks ago and I've been to the new house once, which was a horrible mess. I wonder if they've tidied up that place a little by now, I doubt it very much. My cousin's got a male Ancylometes spec. which is possibly a fully grown adult right now. We'll sort whether he is, and if so I'll bring him home to mate with my female! Quite a few breeding projects going on at the moment.."

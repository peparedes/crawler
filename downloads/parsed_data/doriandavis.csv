Someone must fail
But there comes a point
When we exhale....</I>

As Dickens said, ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" when many of us woke up on Tuesday in America, and prepared to go out and vote. It was a world of opposites: Bush, a conservative. Kerry, a liberal. One man said the economy was booming. The other, said it was collapsing. One man justified the invasion of Iraq. The other, said it was a grand diversion. One man had offensive plans for fighting terrorism. The other, had defensive.

For months, we had been teetering back and forth between two magnets at opposite poles, each of us thinking our candidate would barely pull out a victory. When exit polls started showing up on the Drudge Report by early afternoon, though, with Senator Kerry ahead in every state, a lot of Republicans probably resigned ourselves to the somber notion Bush would join Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher: great pillars of strength, who won wars and saved worlds, but faced defeat at a ballot box.

After all, we are creatures of habit. We want normalcy. And, as Peggy Noonan pointed out, these past few years have been abnormal in human history. I had the television on the night before the election and rocker Eddie Vedder probably put it best in laymen's terms: ""I just don't want to be in a country that's at war anymore."" For me, the Kerry electorate has always been reluctant to admit we are at war, and that we didn't start it. In peacetime, the alternative to war would be peace, and we would all want peace. But in wartime, ""peace"" is not one of the options. They are ""victory"" or ""surrender."" Reagan famously said we could have peace immediately if we would surrender, but we would never be safe again if we did.

My biggest worry of the election would be that we put our government back in the hands of the people who failed us in the 1990s. Under Bill Clinton, three kidnapping and assassination attempts on Osama bin Laden were nixed at the last minute because of various international pressures. Amazingly, the Kerry administration was set to obtain a lot of the same geniuses who ran counter-terrorism and international relations in the 1990s, the period in which the 9/11 Commission determined that the most irreparable damage had been done to the security of America.

In the end, Kerry lost because of 6 poorly recieved rhetorical phrases, 4 of his own and 2 of his wife, Teresa's: 1) ""global test"" 2) ""Mary Cheney"" 3) ""grand diversion"" 4) ""just a nuisance"" 5) ""shove it"" and 6) ""real job."" Ironically, probably the most damning to undecided voters Kerry was appealing toward in the final days of the campaign was Teresa's mistaken assumption that Laura Bush, a former teacher and librarian, had not had a ""real job."" Doubts were already looming about Kerry's ability to handle a national security crisis. On top of it, Teresa presented herself as Marie Antoinette, the Ketchup heiress who had no job herself, except for philanthropy, but belittled the work of housewives, librarians and teachers. In the end, the electorate could not relate to John and Teresa Heinze Kerry.

This election was an epic showdown between liberalism and conservatism, secularism and faith, but mostly it was a stand between freedom and fear. Like Spain, we had a referendum on terrorism: Will we hunker down and spend more on protecting ports, or go after them abroad before they hit us at home? We will go after them abroad. Most importantly, the election sends a signal to the Iraqis: We are with you, Iyad Allowi. Freedom for the Iraqi people is not a ""mistake."" It is not a ""grand diversion."" Freedom in Iraq will re-shape the Middle East. We will stay the course. We will stand with you.

There is a lot of good news today. The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, has risked defeat in his own country to stand with Bush in the fight against terrorism. He is happy today. He said so. The President of Russia, Vlad Putin, has opposed Bush at every impass on the Iraq War, but congradulated him on victory in the election. Putin said to that failing to re-elect George Bush would be a surrender to terrorism. The Prime Ministers of Italy and Poland were overjoyed their old ally, George Bush, is back. This election means the center of gravity in Europe will shift to Poland, Italy, Great Britian and Russia. Decidedly away from France.

The election of 1800, between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, has been called Jefferson's ""Second Revolution,"" because it solidified forever the principle of states' rights within the framework of centalized government, and probably prevented America from backsliding into a monarchy. In the same way, the election of 2004, between George Bush and John Kerry, will reverberate through history. It is a defining moment. For now, the United States has lumbered away from European socialism and subservience to the United Nations. We have repelled from world government. But most importantly, like historian Paul Johnson said, the election has redefined ""how far the world can rely on [us] to protect our civilization."" Dictators around the world have been put on notice: We are ready.

It is a revolution. Bush won more popular votes than any candidate in U.S. history. In fact, the man who wandered into infamy by losing the popular vote in 2000 has become the first candidate to win more than 50 percent of the popular vote since 1988. He was the first candidate since Franklin Roosevelt to win re-election, and expand a hold in the House of Representatives and the Senate. My friends, it is the end of the world as we know it. I feel fine."

"event","<B>I DON'T UNDERSTAND</B>
by Alex Wolf

Tonight I watched a new installment of the MTV show, <B>Made</B>, which I have seen only a couple times in the past.

As per usual, I was peeved and yet infinitely amused by it.

These types of series contribute to a terrible phenomenon that will sweep a generation. That is, that everyone deserves to be famous and the work to achieve this success will be done for you.

To sum it up, this white girl wanted to be on an effectively black hip-hop dance troupe for no particular reason other than to break out of a self-imposed shell. It was ridiculous. Most of these people have psychological problems, it seems, that they try to mask by going on these shows. Something is wrong with you, if you need an MTV series to muster up the courage to do something you supposedly want so badly.

This leads people to understand and accept their own inadequacy. Why do something yourself when you can call MTV and they can do the work for you, to get the ball rolling! At the same time, these people who accept their inadequacy will still likely feel they deserve to be or get whatever it is they want.

As well, as per usual, the person trying to be magically Made was fat and, of course, wanted to do something skinny people are better suited for. This seems to be a trend whenever I watch the show, which admittedly has only been about four episodes. What is MTV trying to say by this?

The show was amusing for many other reasons. For one thing, the girl was about as 'street' as I am - which sho ain't much. As I look at her, I would think she would be better suited for hip hoppin' over to the Dairy Queen to fix Blizzards.

She didn't know a damn thing about hip-hop and everyone could see that. Much like the tired cliche, she was instructed to sassily snap her fingers and dramatically kick her leg back before she turned around to leave the room, in the name of demonstrating 'hip-hop diva attitude'.

Not surprisingly, she wore an inappropriate get-up to the dance troupe teams' audition. At least we, viewers, were spared and she didn't come out looking like Lil Kim. Instead, her look was sort of Avril-meets-Pink. The duds came from Hot Topic, which explains everything. (Hot Topic is a mall chain for faux-goths)

Although I like some reality shows (Amazing Race esp.), the way in which they are making everyone believe that they have the stuff to become famous is a bit sickening. Some people shouldn't be Made. No one is ever going to be satisfied with being a nobody!

What is a viewer supposed to get out of watching <B>Made</B>? I don't understand. Am I supposed to feel inadequate in some field I do not belong to as well?

I can't close this entry without stating the obvious: What MTV needs to be <B>Made</B> into is a cable network that actually plays *music videos*."

"event","<B>""RAISIN"" AND FALLING</B>
by Peggy Noonan

Every now and then you witness a small moment that is actually a big moment. Maybe it alerts you to something surprising that's going on, or maybe it illustrates what you already know but in a new way, one that can't be dodged or avoided. It happened to me the other day at a play, a press preview of the Broadway revival of Lorraine Hansbury's <I>Raisin in the Sun</I>. I love this play. I've seen it several times, but I hadn't seen it in years when I settled into my seat. It has gotten more attention than most shows, mostly because it features the Broadway debut of rap mogul P. Diddy, the former Puff Daddy, who apparently has decided to go by his birth name, Sean Combs. That's how he's listed in the playbill.

I hadn't realized when I first saw it, decades ago, and saw the movie, also decades ago, that <I>Raisin</I> was a landmark play. But it is. It captures with wit and heart a great moment in time. It tells of a black family living on the cusp of cultural liberation in 1950s America. We see them face questions of daily life--what is it to be a man, what is familial loyalty?--as they wrestle with great cultural questions. Shall we, as black Americans, assimilate and become like white Americans? Can we turn back to our African roots to find the truth of our people? Does the older generation have a clue what kind of changes are sweeping the young, or are they too busy surviving to feel the winds of change? Are they in the habit of second-class citizenship?

The family whose story is told is an intact nuclear family. It is clear they are not special because they are intact and functioning--they're average, like everyone else. Everyone works hard--cleaning woman, chauffer--and everyone has dreams. Phylicia Rashad as the mother is transcendent. She is going to make you cry. She's a great actress, and I didn't know it. I thought she was just a persona with a particular kind of dignity, but she is an artist.

Audra McDonald as a young woman married to a ne'er-do-well son is equally brilliant. Sean Combs on the other hand is not a person of artistic talent. The problem is not that he acts like a high school sophomore, though he does--he registers surprise by bulging his eyes and making an O with his mouth. It's that the thing for which he has become famous--strutting and rapping with a jaded slack-jawed look--is not a facet of his talent but the whole of it. When he sings a snatch of song you realize, Oh my God, he can't even sing. I thought rappers could sing but choose not to. Who knew?

But here's a funny thing: there's something moving in it when you realize that he made it as a star in America through sheer will, through a bulldozer's determination. That also is something you get from God, and he got a lot. It took guts for him to do Broadway and bring new people into the theater for the first time, so I suspect he'll get a pass from the critics. This play is going to be a hit because he's in it. 

But I must tell you of the small moment that was actually a big moment. (There's a possible spoiler coming up, so if you don't know the story and mean to see the play, stop here.) An important moment in the plot is when a character announces she is pregnant, and considering having an abortion. In fact, she tells her mother-in-law, she's already put $5 down with the local abortionist. It is a dramatic moment. And you know as you watch it that when this play came out in 1960 it was received by the audience as a painful moment--a cry of pain from a woman who's tired of hoping that life will turn out well.

But this is the thing: Our audience didn't know that. They didn't understand it was tragic. They heard the young woman say she was about to end the life of her child, and they applauded. Some of them cheered. It was stunning. The reaction seemed to startle the actors on stage, and shake their concentration. I was startled. I turned to my friend. ""We have just witnessed a terrible cultural moment,"" I said. ""Don't I know it,"" he responded. And I can't tell you how much that moment hurt. To know that the members of our audience didn't know that the taking of a baby's life is tragic--that the taking of your own baby's life is beyond tragic, is almost operatic in its wailing woe.

But our audience didn't know. They reacted as if abortion were a political question. They thought that the fact that the young woman was considering abortion was a sign of liberation. They thought this cry of pain was in fact a moment of self-actualizing growth.

Lorraine Hansbury died in the mid-1960s when she was only 35 years old. She would be surprised perhaps by how some of the dramatic themes she introduced played out. The whole play is about moral choices--taking chances to make things better. She had a moral mind. She thought the great question of her time was whether the different races in America could learn to treat each other with justice and grace. I can't imagine she'd guess that members of an eager audience in the year 2004 would have become such moral dullards that we wouldn't understand something as basic as an abortion, and what it is. If she were alive now I wonder if she would be surprised, or shocked, that that moment no longer worked as a dramatic plot point because the audience had changed so much in its understanding of the basics.

So much progress followed the 1960s, in so many ways, but applauding abortion isn't progress. It's ugly. And I'm writing this with an odd little hope. That you might go see this great play, and when the moment comes that the young woman announces she might end the life of the child she is carrying, that you would sit quietly and think about what that moment means. And if anyone cheers or hoots or hollers, give them a look. Let them see your silence. Lead with it. Help the people around you realize: <I>Something big is being spoken of here. And we know what it is. And it is nothing good. </I>"

BY BARBARA RAS

But you can have...the touch of a single 11-year-old finger
on your cheek, waking you at 1 a.m. to say the hamster is back.
You can have the purr of the cat and the soulful look
of the black dog.  You can have love. You can speak a 
foreign language, sometimes, and it can mean something. 
You can visit the marker on the grave 
where your father wept openly. You can't bring back the dead, 
but you can have the words <I>forgive</I> and <I>forget</I> hold hands
as if they meant to spend a lifetime together. And you can be grateful
for makeup, the way it kisses your face, grateful for Mozart, 
his many notes racing one another towards joy, for towels
sucking up the drops on your clean skin, and for deeper thirsts,
for passion fruit, for saliva. 
You can have your grandfather, sitting on the side of your bed,
at least for a while.  
You can't count on grace to pick you out of a crowd, 
but here is your friend to tell you how to high-jump
how to throw yourself over the bar, backwards,
until you learn about love, about sweet surrender.
And when adulthood fails you,
you can still summon the memory of the black swan on the pond
of your childhood, the rye bread with peanut bitter and bananas
your grandmother gave you while the rest of the family slept.
There is the voice you can still summon at will, like your mother's.
it will always whisper, you can't have it all,
but there is this.

<B>GOD IN HAWAII</B>
BY BARBARA RAS

And God was there in the dark when I woke sleepless...
I saw God in the hot lava at dusk, unzipping the mountain, God above in the
pink sky, and in the air between the color of sweet potato.
I saw God in the 82 year old woman who sold us leis at the airport
and flexed her bicepts to prove to us she bowls every Tuesday.
I saw God in the breath parting my daughter's lips before she woke,
and I saw God in each and every Hawaiian vowel and in the feeling
I got from touching Alfred's arm, as if little God's were racing up and down,
lighting torches all over the property.
I kept on seeing God everywhere, dancing in a grass skirt,
strumming a ukulele, why not in me?

<B>THE SADNESS OF CHANGE</B>
BY BARBARA RAS

Now there's another child in the kitchen chair, 
tilting it back on two legs, and it's you pleading, <I>Please
don't dip your head closer to the floor that way, tempting gravity,
that old bring-down that'll get you in the end.</I>  
Or else there you are on the edge of a pasture, your chin resting
on a wooden fence that comes right up to cradle it.
Beyond in the low range of hills, cows are quietly getting smaller,
none of them coming home."

"event","I was on a show a few months ago, <I>The Real World Theatre</I>--and I'd never seen an episode of <I>The Real World</I>--and the point of the show was that me and a few of my friends would sit around and watch <I>Battle of the Sexes</I> and kinda make comments about it while it played.  They didn't show us a tape of the show; We had to pretend it was there.  I saw a clip of it--it's the cast of a couple of shows, <I>The Real World</I> and <I>Road Rules</I>, paired up by sexes and doing some kind of stunts and voting eachother off.  It's kinda like <I>Survivor</I>.

But it's silly too--and it got cancelled--so I kinda just forgot about it.

Then one day a few months later I saw a special called <I>The Real World Unmasked</I>, where Danny from <I>New Orleans</I> came out with his boyfriend, Paul, who was in the military and had his face blurred out for the original run of the show.  Now to be honest, I thought it was silly cause I wasn't sitting here for the past 3 years wondering what Paul looked like, and I still don't care.

But I got all these emails--after I said that on the show one day--from people who wanted me to know what a big thing it was that Danny had brought up the issue of gays in the military.  I got a lot of stuff about Pedro Zamora too--he was on the early 90s, and kinda put a face on AIDS.

I had never thought about that, but behind that show was a message that was getting out to people that related to these guys.  Now I don't think Danny's a ""hero,"" but Pedro was, and both of them were a part of it.  

And, you know, behind every good man is a good woman--it's so true--and this time it was Mary-Ellis Bunim, the creator of the show.  She died this week, and I thought it would be good to say bye to Mary-Ellis by letting her know that she changed a lot of people in good--and unintended--ways."

"event","One thing you notice about the Oscars--or any awards show--are all the people that have been together, and aren't now.  That was apparent at the Golden Globes: Nicole was there without Tom Cruise; Tom was there without her.  Dianne Keaton was there, but without Al Pacino (she dated him in the 70s), and Al was there without her.  Brittany Murphy was there; Ashton Kutcher was too, but not with her.

It's like an episode of <I>Dawson's Creek</I>: They're all friends. 

It's bound to happen when you're locked in a room with somebody doing a scene for two days, and it happens to a lot of people in one way or another.  But it also explains how somebody gets an Oscar and we sit at home--kinda unimpressed with the talent--and say, ""What the hell?""

The best example of that was the Julia Roberts win for <I>Erin Brockovitch</I>.  It's a great movie, and Julia--in fairness--took a risk.  But it wasn't a real risk.  It was more like. . .a movie that wasn't a romantic comedy.  I thought she was great, but Ellen Burstyn was up for <I>Requiem for a Dream</I>, and when you put a woman getting shock therapy up against a woman saying, ""They're called boobs, Ed"" it makes for a simple choice.

So I don't think anybody cast a ballot to say that Julia was actually better than Ellen Burstyn. . .I think they might have thought, ""Ellen already has one (for <I>Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</I>), and Julia's been around for a while and she's sweet, so. . .ok, here ya go."" 

And it's fine.

It happened to Russell Crowe when he got it for <I>Gladiator</I> (and not <I>The Insider</I> or <I>A Beautiful Mind</I>), and the most famous ever was Marissa Tomei, who got it for <I>My Cousin Vinny</I>.

I think about Linda Hunt in <I>The Year of Living Dangerously</I> (she played an Asian man in a movie about a reporter on that side of the world), and I didn't even know she was a white girl until the end of the movie.  And now I watch the Oscars and think about her, and then look up and see Marissa get it for <I>My Cousin Vinny</I> and think, ""What the hell have they come to?""  

When I was in high school, we had an awards show in the drama club and we--pretty much--gave it all to our friends.  And, with that, we're back to the show this year: The winners are probably gonna be all friends, like the Penn/Robbins/Sarandon/Baldwin/Harrelson/Garofalo/Sheen/Streisand/Brolin ratpack, and that's okay--it's how it is--so here's who I think has it:

BEST ACTOR
Sean Penn--<I>Mystic River</I>

BEST ACTRESS
Charlize Theron--<I>Monster</I>

BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
Tim Robbins--<I>Mystic River</I>

BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
Renee Zellweger--<I>Cold Mountain</I>

BEST PICTURE
<I>Lord of the Rings</I>

And here's who <I>should</I> have it:

BEST ACTOR:
Bill Murray--<I>Lost in Translation</I>

BEST ACTRESS:
Charlize Theron--<I>Monster</I>

BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR:
Djimon Hounsou--<I>In America</I>

BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS:
Renee Zellweger--<I>Cold Mountain</I>

BEST PICTURE:
<I>Mystic River</I>

But. . .I wouldn't put money on <I>should</I>."

"event","<B>THERE WILL BE TIME</B>
By Peggy Noonan

It has been said that when an idea's time has come a lot of people are likely to get it at the same time.  In the same way, when something begins to flicker out there in the cosmos a number of people, a small group at first, begin to pick up the signals.  They start to see what's coming.

Our entertainment industry, interestingly enough, has plucked something from the unconscious of a small collective.  For about 30 years now, but accelerating quickly this decade, the industry has been telling us about The Big Terrible Thing.  Space aliens come and scare us, nuts with nukes try to blow us up.

This is not new: In the 1950s Michael Rennie came from space to tell us in <I>The Day The Earth Stood Still</I> that if we don't become more peaceful our planet will be obliterated.  But now in movies the monsters aren't coming close, they're hitting us directly.  Meteors the size of Texas come down and take out the eastern seaboard, volcanoes swallow Los Angeles, Martians blow up the White House.  The biggest grosser of all time was about the end of a world, the catastrophic sinking of an unsinkable entity.  

Something's up.

And deep down, where the body meets the soul, we are fearful.  We fear, down so deep it hasn't even risen to the point of articulation, that with all of our comforts and amusements, with all of our toys and bells and whistles. . .we wonder if what we really have is. . .a first-class state-room on the <I>Titanic</I>.  Everything's wonderful, but a world is ending and we sense it.

I don't mean: ""Uh-oh, there's a depression coming,"" I mean: We live in a world of three billion men and hundreds of thousands of nuclear bombs, missiles, warheads.  It's a world of extraordinary germs that can be harnessed to kill whole populations.  Three billion men, and it takes only a half a dozen bright and evil ones to harness and deploy.  

When you consider who is gifted and crazed with rage. . .when you think of the terrorist places and terrorist countries. . .who do they hate most?  The Great Satan, the United States.  What is its most important place?  Some would say Washington.  I would say the great city of the United States is the great city of the world, the dense ten-mile-long island called Manhattan, where the economic and media power of the nation resides, the city that is the psychological center of our modernity, our hedonism, our creativity, our hipness. . .

If someone does the big, terrible thing to New York or Washington, there will be a lot of chaos and a lot of lines going down, a lot of damage and a lot of things won't be working so well anymore.  And thus a lot more. . .time.  Something tells me we won't be teleconferencing or faxing on the Ford account for a while.  

The psychic blow--and that's what it will be as people absorb it, a blow, an insult that reorders and changes--will shift our perspective and priorities, dramatically, and for more than a while.  

So now I have frightened you.  But we must not sit around and be depressed.  ""Don't cry,"" Jimmy Cagney once said.  ""There's enough water in the goulash already.""

I once talked to a man who had a friend who'd done something that took his breath away.  She was single, middle-aged and middle-class, and she wanted to find a child to love.  She went to the orphanages in South America and she took the child who was in the most trouble, sick and emotionally unwell.  She took the girl home and loved her hard, and in time the little girl grew up and became strong, became in fact the kind of person who could and did help others.  Twelve years later, at the girl's high school graduation, she won an award for best all-around student.  

The man's eyes grew moist.  He had just been to the graduation.  ""These are the things that stay God's hand,"" he told me.  I didn't know what he meant.  He explained: These are the things that keep God from letting us kill us all.

So be good.  Do good.  Stay his hand.

<B>EVERYBODY'S BEEN SHOT</B>
By Peggy Noonan

There's a small but telling scene in the Ridley Scott film <I>Black Hawk Down</I> that contains some dialogue that reverberates, at least for me.  The movie, as you know, is about the Battle of the Bakara Market in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1993. In the scene, the actor Tom Sizemore, playing your basic tough guy U.S. Army Ranger colonel, is in charge of a small convoy of Humvees trying to make it back to base under heavy gun and rocket fire.  The colonel stops the convoy, takes in some wounded, tears a dead driver out of the driver's seat, and barks at a bleeding sergeant who's standing in shock nearby:

COLONEL: Get into that truck and drive.

SERGEANT: But I'm shot, Colonel.  

COLONEL: Everybody's shot, get in and drive.

When I was a child in the old America, people said things like, ""It ain't easy.""  Then they'd shrug.  Or, ""Whatta ya want, life ain't easy!""  But now, more than in the past, something has grown in our country, grown perhaps because of good things like psychotherapy or bad things like group-identity politics.  And that something is an increasing tender regard for one's own sensitivities and quirks and problems and woes--twinned with a growing insensitivity to everyone else's quirks and problems and woes.  

This is not progress.

If we became more aware of others instead of demanding that others be aware of our needs, we would probably get a better fix on life, a better perspective, and a better sense of everyone's context.

A Secret Service agent had a hissy fit when an airline pilot refused to let him board a plane carrying a gun with dubious paperwork.  The agent is not only threatening a lawsuit, but wants the airline to be forced to give sensitivity training.  I thought: I think somebody needs sensitivity training alright, but I don't think it's the airline.

I turned on morning television and saw Rosie O'Donnell referring again to the fact that her mother died when she was young.  This is of course very sad, and Rosie has spoken of its sadness very often.  Her sympathy for her loss made me think one day: She doesn't really know that other people lost their mothers when they were young.  She doesn't really know that some people never even had mothers.  

She doesn't know everybody's been shot.

I put on HBO and saw their new young poets' show.  Young poets--well, they say they're poets; I guess they're more like performance artists--come on and sort of strut around a stage and yell, and the more authentic their anger seems, the more the audience applauds and hoots.  These poets seem attached to their separateness and in love with their grievance. ""I am one angry Lebanese lesbian,"" ""I am one angry mother-lovin' whatever.""  They pour out their pain.  But they don't actually seem to be in pain.  They all look like they went to Brown and hang out downtown.  They're not old enough or, in spite of Brown, bright enough to know: everybody's been shot.

The week included the story of a congressman, who by no fault of his own, was humiliated, treated with great insensitivity.  I am speaking of John Dingell, the Democrat from Michigan.  John Dingell was trying to get on a plane the other day when his artificial hip set off a magnetometer.  He pointed out that it was an artificial hip, and I suspect pointed out that he was a member of congress who does not fit the prevailing terror profile.  But you know what the security guards did?  They took him to a side room, made him take his pants off and wanded him.  

When the story became public, the secretary of transportation called him and apologized.  Mr. Dingell waved him off and told him it was okay, he understands, everyone's doing his job.

That's someone who knows that everybody's been shot.

Maybe I will get to sleep when I'm don't with class at 4.....fuck.

"event","Name your top six TV shows before you look at the questions:<br /><br />1) 24<br />2) Grey's Anatomy<br />3) Scrubs<br />4) Dead Like Me<br />5) Freaks and Geeks<br />6) Undeclared<br /><br /><a name=""cutid1""></a><br />1. Who is your favourite character from #2?<br />George O'maley<br /><br />2. Who is your least favourite character from #4?<br />Roxy<br /><br />3. What would a crossover between #1 and #5 include?<br />Jack Bauer starts a rock band! What else? Bauer Power Hour!<br /><br />4. Who is your favourite ship from #6?<br />ship?<br /><br />5. If you were to set one person from #3 and one person from #6 on a blind date, who would they be?<br />J.D. and Lindsey...seems like the only reasonable match.<br /><br />6. If you could meet one person from #4 and spend the day with them, who would it be, and what would you do?<br />Mason. We would probably just sit around doing drugs...wait...that's not a good idea, but he does have an awesome accent.<br /><br />7. If you could change one thing about #2's plot line, what would you change?<br />Not a thing.<br /><br />8. Explain a relationship between two people (not necessarily romantic) from show #5, and why you like the relationship between them.<br />Sam and Ken. Any time they have interaction with one another, it's as if they have a mutual understanding of their differences...and that makes them similar in some way.<br /><br />9. If the lead title characters (first name in the credits) from #1 and #3 were both drowning, and you could only save one, who would it be?<br />I would save J.D. because Jack Bauer can take care of Jack Bauer...possibly by killing the water.<br /><br />10. If you could change the title characters' order in the credits for #4, what order would you choose?<br />I think it works well the way it is because the characters share their own unique charm to the cast<br /><br />11. If you were able to add a new character, any kind of character you wanted, to the storyline for #6, what would the character be like and what would their role be?<br />I would add a janitor character much like the one in Scrubs. He could be the advice giver for each character in their established dilemmas.<br /><br />12. What happens in your favourite episode of show #2?<br />Bomb in chest cavity...chaos ensues.<br /><br />13. If you could kill off one of the characters of #1, who would it be and how would you do it?<br />Kim Bauer + mountain lion = BEST DEATH EVER!<br /><br />14. If you got the chance to visit the set for either show #3 or show #5, which would you choose?<br />Definately 3<br /><br />15. So, I saved the best question for last. If you could date anyone from any of these shows, which show and which person?<br />Georgia from Dead Like Me...I suppose she grew on me."

"event","What a weekend...

On Tuesday it was Kimmie's birthday, so of course the JACT crew had to celebrate. Her actually birthday was Tuesday so we couldn't party yet because people had class. On Wednseday, however, Terrell came in from Jacksonville to stay for the rest of the weekend at my place. So, that night we invited everyone over to my place for a bit of a ""pot-luck"" dinner. It was much fun and very tasty...except for Ted's bowel inducing noodles...god that hurt. Thursday was a pretty normal day. Mall, dinner, DDR, eh. Then on Friday we had our first JACT officer's meeting of the summer. I was pretty pleased with how things went. It was my first meeting as President of the organization and we got alot accomplished. After that, we all came back to my place and I made everyone dinner. Unfortunately we didn't have enough for everyone but I made do with what was avaliable. We tried to watch Dave Chapelle's Block Party...but we failed. About half way through, we kept making random stupid jokes and lost all focus on the movie. Then on Saturday we had another Moore meeting. I was glad to see that we had a really good turnout...over 20 people! That's damn good for the summer. Most of these people were new so I hope they come back in the future. After the meeting, we went over to Matt's place to celebrate Kimmie's b-day. Nicole came all the way from home so it was good to see her. There was pizza, DIRT CAKE, and gifts galore. It was pretty fun, especially....CVS in pajamas, DDR in pajamas, Blackjack, Old Fish, Go Maid!....good times. In the morning, Terrell made everyone breakfast and we went our seperate ways.

All in all it was a good weekend of madness. I was going to rant about something that's been bugging me but maybe I will do that later."

"event","Well, it's the end of the first half of Summer semester and I am glad to finally be out of that waste of time class (AKA: Public Speaking). Grades aren't in yet for that class but I'm pretty sure I got an A. 

My roommate moved out yesterday and now it would seem that I am the ONLY person on this floor. It's really creepy because right now, there dirty sheets and pillows outside of all of the doors on the floor. Our building was one to be housing med-school students. It was kind of neat to see them getting on the elevator in their white coat every now and again. Starting on Wednseday, I will find out if I have any more roommates coming in for C session. I knod of hope I don't get any because I like having a bathroom to myself, especially since I have never had to share one before.

I think I'm going to Warped Tour in Jacksonville next week. It started out as 3 of us going but one has decided not to go for a pretty lame reason. Oh well. It should be fun, especially since I've wanted to go for some time. I do worry about my money situation right now though, because I just spent $130 at the grocery store...ouch.

Summer is not going as well as I had hoped it would...I guess things change...people change...life change...I hope it's all for the better, but right now I can't be too confident about that. Also, now I wonder what I will do for the break between Summer and Fall. The original plan went to shit so now I have to come up with something. The easy answer would be to go to Otakon, but right now I don't really have the funds to do so. Also, I'm not too pleased with any of the guests or events. It's looking to be just an ordinary convention where I spend more money than I should. We shall see.

I need a haircut. I'm getting the really ""Shaggy"" look these days and I am ready to get rid of that. I want to try something new but I have NO clue what I want to do with it. It makes it difficult because I think any specialty haircut would look terrible on a redhead. Maybe it will come to me in a dream.

Other random facts about ""B-Town"":
-Started watching Scrubs...even if it is 5 years late for me I love it!
-Bought RHCP-Stadium Arcadium. It's alot better than I was expecting. 
-Went to the gym. Hopefully it will stick and I will go more than once a month.
-Started and finished Fullmetal Alchemist. I had been meaning to get through this series and I am glad I finally forced myself to. Warm, fuzzy, angsty, action?, fun. Good stuff.

I guess that'll do it for me tonight. If you have any questions and/or wish to subscribe to this magazine, please feel free to contact Customer Service for more details."

It was Laura's 20th birthday this weekend and we had a party to celebrate! This of course after seeing X-Men 3. It was a very good movie that I had only minor problems with...but all small potatoes. Anyway, the big surprise to Laura and many others in our group was Terrell. He had everyone beleiving that he wouldn't be able to make it to Laura's birthday because his car was dead. Of course this was the plan all along and he showed up for the party and the rest of the weekend. Long story short...the party could have gone alot better. It started off great...great presents, pasta, cake, Peanut Butter Jelly Time, etc. Eventually, we started drinking and things went a little crazy. I am not the one to spread gossip about others but on my behalf, I woefully admit to having drunk too much for my own good. I ended up getting really sick and really emotional...never a good combination. After that night, I had lost all desire to drink. I think about it now and the thought of anything past a beer sickens me. I guess I have learned my lesson in some form. 

On the scholastic end, my speech class has gone well enough. My informative speech on the JET programme went fairly well, 194/200 well infact :). Then, we had a quiz on Friday that was a joke because we went over the answers as a class...weird...but then again, it is a SPEECH class. :shrug: 

I've started reading Hitchhiker's Guide a little more, hoping to finish at least one of the books by the end of the first half. Also, I finally got myself to start going to the gym again. I ran about 4 miles today and lifted a bit. Of course, since it has been some time...I am quite exhausted. Therefore, the best thing for me to do now is sleep for my early class. 

Oyasuminasai!!"

"event","It has been quite a weekend I say!

Friday, a bunch of us went to the movies to see Over the Hedge. It was alot better than I was expecting from a Dreamworks CG spectacle-post Shrek. William Shatner, Bruce Willis, Steve Carell, and Nick Nolte were just a few of the great voices in the film that made it even more entertaining. After that, we went to Kim/E. Laura's place to watch A Goofy Movie. A few of my friends have been on a kind of Disney movie binge and this was the one up for the evening. It's funny how much of that movie I was able to recall.

On Saturday afternoon I got a call from Matt and me, him, Kim, E. Laura, Nicole, and Mike all went swimming. I was really glad to go because it had been some time. Then, that night, we had our first official Summer semester meeting for JACT. We had a pretty small turnout, which I kind of expected because of the timeframe. Overall, it was a fairly succesful meeting, minus some technical issues, but I suppose that happens. After the meeting, we all went bowling. I bowled a 129...I think. Overall it was pretty fun. Then, we began to break off and a few of us went over to Matt's. Some of us had a bit to drink. I was glad to be a happy drunk this time, and thank god for the BatPuter being ""hardcore"" enough to help the sickly. Despite that unfortunate detail, it was a fun evening. 

Now here on this Sunday afternoon, I am thankful for this weekend. I needed it.

"event","Well the summer session has started for us all so I guess I should update to go along with it. Things have kind of gotten off to a weird start with me on a personal level but that is where it shall stay. Anyway, I started my 1 speech class on Wednseday morning at 8AM! Waking up early will take some getting used to I suppose, but the class is easy to stay awake in because it's basically a discussion class - hence the ""speech"" element. The other reason comes by way of the fact that there are only 6 of us in the class so we just sit in a little circle like a group of friends. The teacher is a young graduate student named Rebecca (I don't remember the last name), and she seems pretty nice. I am just glad that the summer is starting off light for me, especially with what is about to happen this weekend. 

Now onto that...after two semesters of unsanitary conditions, I am finally moving out of this apartment. Over the past two semesters I have been living with this guy who has only 10% of his sight left. He is a really nice guy but he is horribly unsanitary...leaving raw meat on the stove, cooked chicken and rice on the floor....EXPLODED SODA IN THE FREEZER, and old grease in the drawers? GROSS! I tried to get the room changed near the end of the Spring semester because I didn't ask for a renewal but they gave me one anyway. At that time, they told me there were no rooms avaliable for the summer. This later turned out to be a lie. What happened was that because I have a disability, I can only stay in rooms with accomidations...but I don't need that stuff. My disability has no direct hinderance on how I live my daily life sans the ability to drive. Anyway, when the summer rolled around, we got a new roommate. This roommate is completely blind and partially deaf. So in turn, I have become the ""babysitter"" of the apartment. I woke up this morning and took a shower, when I came back into my room I heard a glass fall. Apparently, the new guy had knocked over a PITCHER of water onto the floor. Of course, all of the water went into my area, getting under my groceries and old computer parts. NOT GOOD! So I went down to University Housing, and after basically pleading and reasoning with them, they switched me to a normal room without the accomidations crap. Therefore, this weekend, I will be making the move over to another building. Hopefully, since it is the weekend, I will have some help from friends because I have ALOT of junk. 

I guess that is the big news to speak of.

In other news, I picked up Brain Age for the DS. It's pretty neat. All the DS functions work out perfectly (technically speaking), and I found myself having odd bits of fun with it. I love things that are innovative and thought provoking (literally). When I first started it said my Brain age was 76 and that it should be at 20. This means that my brain is tired and lazy. Sounds about right to me :). 

Also got to hang out with Jaime, which was lots of fun!

I guess that's about it for now. I should probably start getting ready for bed since I have to get up around 7 for class so...TA!"

"event","Wow...it sure has been some time since I took the time to write in this thing. Alot has happened over the past few months but I have just never gotten up the energy to write it all out. I guess I can give a bit of an update...for those that still read this.

Media Productions:
Well, I finally got into my major. I applied for the second time in February and over Spring Break, I found out that I made it in. I start classes this Summer but more on that later. It seems like it's going to be a fun major because the courses are all things that I like doing or things that I want to learn. 

Spring Break:
Spring break was alright. I was originally planning to go with Laura to her parents place and then to see a concert in Tampa over that week. Turns out her parents didn't want me to come. They don't seem to like me as much as I had hoped. So, I went home to MD. It was alright I suppose. I did the normal stuff I did when I was still living there. Saw everyone, including some unexpected meetups. All in all it was a relaxing break and the news of my acceptence into the major was refreshing.

Next Semesters:
Summer 06-
I will be staying for the whole summer this year, mainly because I am behind in coursework and I need to do at least one summer semester to graduate. Here is what I am taking...

Session B - first half of summer
SPC2600 - Public Speaking - Required for graduation and my major. The only really drawback to this class is that on Monday and Wednseday, I have to be there at 8 to 10...gross.

Session C - Second half of summer
FIL2000 - Elements of Film - This should be a fun class because it's exactly what it sounds like.
RTV3104 - Narrative Writing in Film and TV - I am looking foward to this class because I want to improove my writing skills, especially with JACT: The Motion Picture on it's way to production.
This session will be fun but kind of long class wise. On Wednseday specifically, I have class from 11:25 until 7:25PM.....gross.

Fall 06:
JPN3930 - Japanese Lit in English - I am taking this class for fun. Yasuhara-sensei is teaching it so it should be interesting.
JPN220 - Int Reading and Conv. (aka Japanese III) - Not much I can say about this one except that I have a different teacher than I am used to. Should be interesting.
RTV3221 - Single Cam Production - Now we are getting to the fun stuff.
RTV3263 - Video Post Production - My most anticipated because I like Post production work.

The good thing about Fall classes is that I have NO classes on Friday and only ONE class on Monday and Wednseday. The price I pay for this is class on Tues and Thurs from 9:45-4:50 with only a half hour break.


Laura:
Why would I make a seperate column for my girlfriend? I suppose because being with her is a major part of my life. I love her to death and she is my reason for living. I think that's good enough reason. We are going on 6 months coming up in May and things are well enough. We have some small spats, but I think that has to do with the fact that we are around each other 24/7. Another strange issues that has come into play is that I have begun to have personal issues based after my past in MD. It wasn't until recently that I realized that I have a major issue in trusting people. Don't get me wrong, I trust Laura, but it seems that she is the only person I have really felt that I can trust. I suppose in my mind it's an aspect that I can't accept because I am used to being fucked over. I am working to better myself in this situation and I hope that it doesn't turn bad. If I lose Laura, I will have lost a part of my self. I just hope she knows how much I truly love her - even to the point that I can't describe with words. She completes me and without her I would be empty.

I guess that's about it for now. I will try to update this more later, and not delay so much.

TTFN!


PS: Oh yeah! I am also the President of the Japanese Animation Club of Tallahassee - rad!

"event","Phew...where do I start.

Well I am back from the best part of my winter break, spent completely with Laura and her family. First off, let me reiterate the point that this was the best part of my winter break. Everything about the area and her specifically was perfect and I wouldn't have had it any other way.

So let's go over a recap of events.

Friday: Got into Sarasota at around 5 ish and got to see my love for the first time after a greuling 2 weeks. She jumped me from behind, giving the surprise I needed to get started. Then we took the long drive back to Cortez to run in for a quick moment to meet her parents before we escaped to go to the circus. All the frightening build up that she gave me helped because I was expecting the worst and got the nicest welcome I could have ever hoped for. Her dad was ALOT nicer than I was warned about and her mom was very welcoming. She made us Sausage Rolls and Dr. Pepper. Oh yeah, and before we got there, we stopped at Publix (the rich one) and picked up some flowers for her. She seemed very surprised and amused by the act of kindness. Those flowers, to my surprise, were placed nicely on the dining room table.
   Then it was off to the Circus put on by the Sarasota Sailors. It was pretty neat and I got some good footage with my new camera. After that we met up with her friends Leigh and Andy. We seemed to get along well I hope and I think they liked me. afterthoughts from them have yet to be obtained as they left the next day for North Carolina I believe. The four of us went to St Arden's Circle to get ice cream. I bought some $9 fudge that later turned out to be really sketchy to me. Mint Chocolate Chip Fudge is not as tasty as it looks.
   We took them home and came back to her place and sat around watching TV until whatever time and we went to bed. 

As a side note, I had to sleep on an air matress in the den/computer room, right next to Laura's bedroom. It was comfortable at first until it started running out of air. An additional note comes from Bijou, Laura's little puppy. Somehoe, her dog got along with me very well...perhaps TOO well. According to Laura, he hasn't been as calm as he was around me, as opposed to her other friends. CRAZY!

Saturday: I was pleasently awoken by Laura's smiling face and dragged out of bed. I was treated to the greatest breakfeast in the world by her mom. EGGS BENEDICT!!!!!!! If you know me enough, then you have probably heard me ranting about how no one ever makes Eggs Benedict, or Poached Eggs for that matter. Let me just say that this was the best breakfeast I have had in years. Simply AMAZING. A little much on the holendaze sauce but  I think my tastebuds are just extra sensetive to that flavor. Laura and I ate this glorious breakfeast together on the balcony overlooking the water. All in all it was a wonderful morning. After breakfeast and a quick shower, we went biking. SHOCK! I haven't been biking in years. We went across a bridge and I almost died a few time, but it was a lot of fun and I hope to do that again sometime soon in some form. After the bike ride, we came back and I got to meet her sister Emily and her daughter, Abigail. She shyed away of course but that's normal for a child that young I suppose. After that we just lazed around a bit. It was very relaxing and I loved it because I was doing what I love best, relaxing with someone I love dearly. The day went by so fast and yet felt so perfectly timed. After an eventual trip to the store for some groceries for her mom, we sat around and watched MTVs New Years party thing. I got the kiss I wanted as the ball droped and we just stayed there together for the remainder of the night. It was perfect.

Sunday: This was a pretty relaxcing day and I think we woke up around 1 or so. We eventually went out to Best Buy and the mall. We were in search of Dance Dance Revolution - any version. I ended up picking up Undeclared at Best Buy which I was happy to finally get. Then we found DDR Max 2 at EB. We were hungry by this point so we went out to Outback for dinner. I had this awesome Pasta Cyclone thing that was just painfully good! After that we got back to her place and we watched some Undeclared late into the night. LAURA LIKES IT!!!!! She has good tastes. :)

Monday: There has been this dispute about when we celebrate our anniversary, because it occured in the middle of the night. I say the 3rd, she says the 2nd. So we decided to take both days out to celebrate. We woke up the normal time on Monday and she demanded her surprise. So I gave her her Soccer Build-A-Bear. She loved it and I loved that she smiled for it. We played some DDR that day and I hate to say that I really like DDR now...I feel dirty. A little later, we went out to the Haibachi resturaunt Daruma that she had been yelling about in the past months. I have to say, I have a hard time deciding whether I like Daruma or Sakura better. I think the only reason I would rule in favor of Sakura is because it is a little cheaper. Nonetheless, the food at Daruma was damned amazing!!! After that we took a trip to the rich people mall (South Gate) and I bought a Futurama calander. After that we went to the bowling alley for some much needed BOWLING. We had a blast. I did pretty well but my arm was hurting by the time we got to the fourth game. We didn't realize that the initial fee was for THREE hours of bowling. Three hours with 2 people is ALOT. Anyway, after that we drove around for a bit then came home to more Undeclared. TEHE

Tuesday: Here we have the 2nd Anniversary day. We spent some alone time together in the morning and then went out for what would someting amazing. We got in the car and she blind folded me! I was a little scared. After about an hour we stopped and we were at the beach. She bought Subway and we ate dinner together on the beach, watching the sunset. At that moment I had fallen in love with her even more than I already was...something I didn't think would be possible so soon. I love it when the romance in a relationship is double sided. We sat there watching the sunset and then we went to get some ice cream. I had a little too much and couldn't finish it - shame on me. When we got home, apparently her mom was making dinner for us all and didn't know we had already eaten. To be polite, we forced ourselves to eat some more and it was a pleasent dinner with her and her parents. I apparently gave away some very strange 'blind' manurisms that her mom pointed out later but I don't recall doing them...oh well. After dinner we went upstairs to play pool and Laura kicked my ass, but not by much. It was then 10 and we went into her room to watch Meet The Barkers. After that wa started to watch a few episodes of Freaks and Geeks. SHE LIKES THAT TOO!!!!! 

It was the last night of me sleeping on that air matress...

Wednseday: We had planned to wake up early and go to places that we hadn't had the chance to go to. The music store, 4 and 20 Pastries, etc. That didn't work so well I guess cause we woke up at 11:30 and slowly moved about the house. We ended up back in the room I was sleeping and we napped together on the air matress for a few hours until we had to leave to take me to the airport. It was a good drive an da bit calming. We got to the airport and got some food before I went into the gate. We were both a bit upset for the parting but I know we wil be okay. After all, it's only for 3 days. On Saturday morning, EARLY, I will be back in Tallahassee to met her as well as the rest of my Tally group. 

I suppose that is all for now. Or at least all that I need to say so that people can know how happy I am. If I seem too sappy or cheesy for you, too bad. I love this girl and always will. I hope everyone in St. Louis had fun and I will talk to you all later on. For now, I am gonna try and find something to kep me occupied until Saturday morning. Mario Kart DS mayhaps??


BYES!"

"event","Well it certainly has been a while since I have taken the time to update this thing. After some extra encouragement and a slight desire to rant, I have dusted off my keyboard and prepared for this entry. Let's see here....

So finals are done and the fall semester is in the bag. Now I am back in Maryland - ambushed by a bit of drama but I have been trying to ignore it. Sure, one situation is my fault and I feel like an asshole for it, but I just don't want it to get me down while I'm back here for this week. 

Speaking of finals. I did pretty well surprisingly. I probably aced my Japanese final, I got an A on my Shakespeare, and Mass Media Law finals. Then, I just found out that I got a 27/30 on my Film Theory paper - giving me a final grade of an 81. I'm still kind of in shack from that. The only class I'm not sure of is Fiction Technique mainly because we didn't have a final.

I got some gifts already for Christmas. A thanks is in order for Terrell for Under The Knife for the DS - great game. Thanks to Matt/Kim for Pheonix Wright. Thanks to Jaime for...wait...where is my Animal Crossing DS!?! Then of course thanks to Laura for Firefly and the Serenity book, Fight Club, and my belated birthday cake. You are amazing!

There are currently three situations of drama here in MD and seeing as how I don't want the drama, I will be quick about it.
1. My brother and his now ex-fiance - This is very touchy because it's fucked up and someone has fucked with a part of my family...that's all I will say about that.
2. Chris vs. Kirk/Amy - To me, this is a very retarded situation. I'm staying out of it directly and I am not going to try and change minds, but for the record, I think this was handled poorly and some people need to grow up. 
3. Me not going to St. Louis - This is something that I admitadly caused and I feel awful for it. Not because I made the decision, but because I failed to realize how much I would hurt a friend. For the record on this, my intentions were never to be against anyone, I do NOT put ranks on friendship, and I certainly didn't see this coming for me. I have found someone who makes me insanely happy and I want to know that her family likes me too because something like that is VERY important to me. I made this decision because it felt right to me, but knowing that I let a friend like CAT down hurts the most. I'm sorry CAT, and I hope you understand that though those are the only words I can give you, I mean them with all of my heart.

So with that behind me, I am sitting here freezing my ass off in MD. I will be here throuh Christmas, then on the 26 I will go with my parents to West Virginia to visit my grandparents, then back here on the 28, then to Sarasota, FL on the 30th to see my Laura and meet her family, then back here on the 4th, and finally back to FSU on the 7th to begin the Spring semester on the 9th. Ouch, what a busy vacation, but it should be fun!

Anywho, I guess that's all I can think of right now. So until next time...
Saiyonara!"

<br />Kindness is most important in a boyfriend/girlfriend.  You want someone who will go through everything with you - the best moments and the worst, and all of those other moments in between.  You love to be able to say anything to your partner, and have them say anything to you.  You are able to be extremely close with your partner for that reason.<br />

"event","I finally shelled out the money and bought a DS yesterday. It's the bright blue masculine/femanine one that goes side by side with the pink one that everyone wanted me to get. I have to say that I love it! I have to say even more that I love Nintendogs, the main reason for the purchase. I currently am raising a little Labrador(sp) Retriever named....of all things Bob ^_^. Even funnier, Bob...is a female. I've been doing well now that I have gotten the hang of raising a virtual puppy, and strangely enough, I don't really shy away from talking to it in public. Am I a dork? Yes! But I am having fun so BLAH to everyone else.

In other news, my week is about done thanks to Veterans day giving us a 3 day weekend. Maybe I can finally rest up ALOT since I haven't been doing that lately. Anywho, time to write more Fiction critiques before class.

"event","I'm going to be really quick about this as usual because I need to write my 5-7 page Shakespeare paper T_T. 

I guess the biggest news is to say that I have a new girlfriend who makes me happy and I assume/hope I make her happy too. Naturally, I have been hanging out with her alot lately, going to concerts, movies, rooms, etc. Went to see Rocky Horror Picture Show on Friday night at the SLC. It was wonderfully amusing once I got the hang of what was going on. I suppose the only other really notable thing was the amazing All American Rejects, Roonie, Academy Is... concert from last night. I had some trouble getting in at first because my name wasn't on the list. I just checked my bank statement now and I guess something got screwed up because there is no charge...but I swear I got the ""Thank You"" page after I bought the tickets :shrug:. Technology is a bitch sometimes. Anyway, after some confusion, the guy FINALLY told me that I could pay cash for a ticket. It would have saved so much time if I had known that. Sadly, through all the madness, I missed the first half of The Academy Is... set. I was kind of bummed about that because I really like them thanks to Laura's influences. So yeah, the night was fun and so were the proceedings(sp) thereafter. 

Now I must go shower before I take this long journey into FINALLY writing my procrastinated Shakespeare Research Paper...I tend to work better under pressure anyway...hmm Under Pressure...such a good song...

Seen a bunch of movies; some good some bad. Hung out with awesome people; Laura, Terrell, Joah, Jaime, Skip, Joe, Matt, and the rest of the JACT crew. Played lots of Soul Calibur 3, leading to many sleepless nights. Almost done FEAR. Shakespeare paper got pushed up to next Monday so I am in relief. Saw the Bravery in concert. Going to see All-American Rejects on Saturday. Going to see Jarhead tonight. Had some emotional ups and downs that thankfully went away very quickly :). Crammed for some tests. Failed a Kanji quiz. Possibly failed a Media Law Test. Drove a Safety Bus ^_^. Payed a towing fee for a friend even though Maryland could not be properly identified. Watched some drunk lesbians dance for my amusement. 

Kitty likes M&M's
Practice my stabbing
Kareoke Revolution
(high pitched girl) It's Ready!
JACT: The Motion Picture
Killer Tofu
and other type stuff I cannot think of at the moment.

If this all seems like pure gibberish to you, I apologize. I am just too lazy to explain EVERYTHING to people who weren't there :(. Maybe I will when I'm not so tired."

"event","This is what I just read:

If the re-presentational theory diverges from a simple resemblance approach, it also diverges from our ordinary concept of representation, including photographic representation. Indeed, the re-presentational theory is merely homonymous with our everyday sense of representation. For example, the representation sense of representation is broader than our ordinary notion. It maintains that a cinematic shot and its referent are identical because the image is a causal effect of the light reflected by the model. It is in this sense that photographic representation is said to be re-presentational. Yet, by this standard, we must endorse many kinds of images that we do not ordinarily count as representational. A close-up of a square inch of a bare, undifferentiated wall is a representation putatively, but it is hardly what we usually call a representation. Obviously, recognizability is key to our ordinary concept of representation. Re-presentation, however, proposes itself as a physicalist analysis without psychological dimensions. Therefore, all manner of shots - like the close-up of the wall - satisfy the requirements of representation without being what we generally think of as representational images. Thus, the operative concept of re-presentation here is broader than our ordinary concept of representation in that shots we would typically count as non-objective and contrary to the style called representationalism, the re-presentational theory must count as representational in its very sense of the word.

"event","Well it is once again past 2 and I am not in bed... This has become a routine with me as of late. Either I can't fall asleep, I don't feel like sleeping, or I'm studying/doing HW. I think that all of this lack of sleep has put me in a rut, both physically and emotionally. I walk from class to class every day, moving past like a zombie. Then, when I get to class, unless it's Japanese or I have something to amuse me, I fall asleep. It doesn't help that I have no interest in half the classes I am taking...

Japanese:
I love it and always will. It's a wonderful language and this is the one thing I have gotten right so far this semester. 

Film Theory:
I thought this class would be fun from what I had heard/read of it. However, as the weeks go by, I find myself more lost and unable to grasp the course. It's not so much that I don't understand what the theories are or how they are emplied..they just aren't sticking. I have a mid-term in this class on Thursday and even though I have been studying like crazy, I am still scared shitless.

Mass Media Law:
This is one of those big 150+ student courses that is held in a lecture hall. This is the simple case that I just don't have interest in what is being taught. It's like my Intro to Mass Media course from last semester where I just crammed at last minute and still did well becaus 80+% of the material is taken straight out of the book.

Intro to Shakespeare:
Another course that I just don't have interest in. We speed through the plays and barely discuss them. It's all a focus on Elizabethan history....I hate history. I hate going to this class because I am just bored out of my mind for all 50 minutes. I'm not too worried about the mid-term for this course, however, we have a 10 page paper due in the first week of November that I am not too keen on.

Fiction Technique:
This is the only other class I really enjoy besides Japanese. I haven't been doing the readings like I probably should be (I'll pay for it if the time comes), but I have started to do some writing that slightly amuses me.

I suppose the biggest problem I am having as of late is that I am so busy with these 5 classes, that I never have time to do what I love and what I came here to do; video production/editing. And if I do get the free time to do it, I am usually too tired to mess with it. This brings up another fear that I have recently developed. I am starting to wonder if I have made the right choice in my college career. 

In 2003, when I first became interested in FSU, I had gotten many reccomendations about their Communications Department. As well, when I read about the Media Productions program, I was excited. Everything was a build up of positive enforcement. I was told I had a solid course set, I would have a good chance of getting into the program- being a transfer student, I would be able to graduate in 2007. When I didn't make it into the program for this fall, I was upset to say the least...I was suddenly lost. Almost without warning, I would up as an English major. It was a fallback that I was unsure of then and am unsure of now. Also, now that I have gotten to take a step back from the College of Communication, I notice how mediocre it is in comparison to FSU's main strengths. So now I am here, stressed out as all fuck, juggling 5 drastically different courses, and empty handed with new material for my re-application for the MP program that is less intriguing that it was 2 years ago. All of this has simply gotten me wondering. Is it worth it to continue my education at FSU when I am taking courses that I could be taking elseware, for less money, and closer to home. Let's weigh the Pros and Cons...

FSU:
Pros-
All around top school that would look good on a resume.
New friends that I have grown to care about.
JACT - friends, and a relaxing hobbie that keeps me sane.
Outstanding Florida Disability Program both financially and academically - and they get the job done!
Cons-
$500 per credit hour - about $8,000 a semester.
Tiresome and expensive trips to and from home.
The original reason for enrolling is now blurred.

In State MD School (or closer (VA, DE, NY):
Pros-
Closer to home, friends, and most importantly Adrienne.
In state tuition is MUCH MUCH cheeper locally.
I can take my time in graduating and not feel guilty about the fees.
John's Hopkins - prooven best resource for my eyesight.
Cons-
Marylands Disability services are pathetic - they are all assholes.

Of course there is more to life than a pro/con list; I know that. I don't know... Maybe it's just the stress or lack of sleep, but it just seems that I can't get through a solid semester here without having these similar type doubts. I'm just starting to wonder if I just don't belong at FSU, like this is some ""sign"" or whatever that this isn't where I need to be. I don't know anymore...I just don't know..."

So here we go!<br> As I promised...my AWA update.<br> Being my first year at AWA (Anime Weekend in Atlanta), I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It turned out to be much better than I could have hoped. It started off well when I got picked up at 6 by Skip, Jaime, and Rose. It was pretty a calm 5.5 hour drive to Atlanta. When we got there, there was a bit of confusion with the rooms, but we got it settled relatively quickly. The room was amazingly spacious for the price and was simply and elevator ride down to the convention. I'm a bit tired so I suppose I will try to shorten this a bit.<br> <br> The Good: Dealer's Room was wonderful. Found some good deals. AMV Iron Chef contest.

For whatever reason that I cannot put into human dialect, I have decided to actually try and keep this thing updated. I have been doing a somewhat decent job with my Xanga, but I owe that to Rei-chan, and Neko-chan. If you are reading my journal for the first time, please disregard the previous entries as childish High School banter. There was a time when I was very EMO and bitchy. I am actually quite happy these days. I'm enjoying FSU alot more, despite the tiresome work. I'm in love with someone. Everything just seems pretty mellow and satisfying these days. I don't really have the time to make a huge update at the moment, but I plan to soon post a solid AWA update. All that must be said at the moment is that it kicked complete ass.

"event","Ok, so tonight I had to work and bring in the ""shipment"". I find myself thinking alot when I do this. Tonight I was racing around in my mind the various meanings of the words ""dork"" and ""nerd"". I thought alot about how it would be interesting to find a catagorization for each and to develop a standard for each......yeah shipment was REAL fun. Anyway, such thought brings into question....What is a dork? What is a nerd? What are the various levels of each? 

I've come up with a few examples and possible labels for each:

You are a low level DORK if you.....

Like videogames occasionally, slide the mind slightly into foreign forms of entertainment, know the difference between RAM and ROM, get excited about E3, or work in a videogame/movie/music store.

These people, inclding myself, ARE low level DORKS.

You are a mid level DORK if you.....

Play videogames, occasionally watch foreign entertainment, know the difference between a gigabyte and a megabyte, know what C++ is, have dorky friends, listen to classical music, or know the release date for Halo 2.

These people, including myself, ARE mid level DORKS.

You are a high level DORK if you...

Play RPGs, watch alot of foreign entertainment, read Manga, listen to Videogame music, listen to Anime music, have more than 2 next-gen consoles, know the difference between JAVA and VisualBasic, know the release date for the next version of Windows, or occasionally enjoy Japanese candy.

These people, including myself, ARE high level DORKS.

You are an UBER DORK (the ultimate in dorkiness) if you....

Play many RPGs, play MMORPGs, play CHAT RPGs, Interact on message boards, use LiveJournal, Watch and collect ANIME, watch and collect foreign entertainment, eat Pocky, quote anime, COSPLAY, Collect videogame and/or anime music, own/or run your own dedicated server, cry at the end of a videogame, go to LAN parties, speak in 1337, know what 1337 means, or play D&D.

These people.......including myself....ARE UBER DORKS!

Okay, now I know that I have left some details out. Keep in mind that it IS nearly 2 AM and I DO have to work tomorrow morning. Nonetheless, one must realize that there are also certain off center levels of Dorks...as follows....


If you watch hentai, or cry at the end of an RPG, you are what we call...

The Sexually Frustrated Dork


If you keep tabs of your collections in computer programs IE: DVD Profiler, you are what we call...

The Overzealous Dork


If you cry over the loss of a saved game or character in an MMO game, you are what we call...

The Lonely and Dependent Dork


Let it also be noted that these offshoots are simply different branches of ones true dorkiness.

This catagorization must also remind us that it is not BAD to be a dork. In fact, with the constant growth of the internet, one may find that it is quickly becoming ""cool"" to be a dork. With that said, one may question whether or not it is good to be a dork or not. Many true dorks have become so because they did not consider themselves part of the ""cool"" status and were found best suitable for a life apart from the human norm. Whatever the case, I am a dork and if you are reading this so are YOU, but that's A-OK by me!

What's not good is being a NERD. It's not bad to be a nerd either, however, it is quickly replacing the past standing of DORK. Because of this current status, the position of NERD can be simply described within one simple explination.

You are a NERD if you...

Play Collectible Card Games (Star Wars CCG, Yu Gi Oh!), write NPC scripts, write in C++, become sexually eroused by perfect lines of code, desire to play ""MULTIPLAYER REG-Edit"", Host LAN parties, or have fantasy sword fights in your backyard.

These people, suprisingly NOT me, are NERDS.


Well now that I have cleared that up for everyone, consider yourself more educated then when you first signed on.

On another more unpleasent note, I recenly finished watching Boogiepop Phaontom. DORK ALERT! For those of you who are unfarmiliar, Boogiepop Phantom is a very dark and VERY confusing anime serious about.....aliens, children, memories, the angel of death, serial killers, man-eaters, composite humans, butterflies, drugs, Poom Poom, an abandoned amusement park, and highschool. Well, that is what I picked up on anyway. Bottom line is...I have no idea what the FUCK I just watched. Creepy as shit and confusing as hell. If this is your kinda deal, check it out....maybe you'll have better luck than I did.


Well, I suppose it's high time for my dorky ass to hit the hay....TTYL 1337 R0X0R!"

"event","Woah.....never thought I'd be updating this thing. If you are reading, ignore all of those previous entries. Until I get up the patience to delete them, they will forever remain a stain of my overly dramadic and depressing teenage angst period. FUN!

Anyway, I't like 9:30 on a Wednseday and I got up the urge to actually write something semi-sensible into this journal. Seeing as how my life isn't all that exciting and all I really do is work, play video games, and stare blankly at my computer, this journal might not interest you. Then again, the internet and even video games are becoming more and more popular. Well....damnit.....that makes me think....WARNING: ANGRY RANT APPROACHETH!

Ah, video games; once the ultimate excape from life (besides the internet). Now, every cockhead with 50 bucks can come into my world! I'm not talking about the people who actually play videogames for said escape...I'm talking about those ignorant jock bastards that play, of all things, SPORTS GAMES! When the hell did it become 'cool' to play baseball on your TV!?! Or football for that matter?

I must warn you that my next section in this rant may sound racist but I particularly am not racist. Everything I say is the truth and I was there to watch it happen!

Not only are sports games slowly draining the industry of any sense, but the type of people who buy those games are just making it even worse. They are making it easier and easier for companies to bring out any piece of garbage they can fling poo at! And you know who buys it? Crazy black people! Don't for a second think that I have snything against the black community. In fact, I have several black friends. I am not talking about the community as a whole. I am talking about the people that come into a store like Babbages (or Gamestop i suppose), come up to the counter and say ""Yo man you got that new Madden joint?"" .......At this point I want to not only criticize their interest in such a game but also put them down for asking me like that. Does this make me a terrible person?

It's not just black people anymore though. Nowadays you get the white-black, mixed, confused, pre-teens. ""Oh man, Scary Movie 3, that joint was off the hook!"" As spoken by a short chubby white kid....WHAT!?! My god has public school taught nothing? This is the same kid who will in the next year will come up to the counter and ask for the ""new Madden joint.""

I may be confused, but I thought that sports were meant to bring people outside. Leave me to be alone inside like the huge dork I am. If it were up to me, I would be done with all sports games. I would give back to the communit of gamers a renewal of that same escape that sucked them in all those years ago. Games like Beyond Good & Evil and Phantasy Star. 

I think I have gotten so angry at thinking about sports games that I have lost all other thought. On that note, I end this rant saying Please please stop buying sports games.... If you do, don't gloat about it. 

Im gonna go back to playing Phantasy Star Online.....a true escape."

"event","I had Kirk, Beth, and Heather over tonight. It was pretty cool. We watched Nightmare on Elm Street, on the crappy ass VHS format. I PISS ON VHS! Anyway, the whole night I was sensing just this whole weird atmosphere around me. It happens to me alot. I'll just be sitting around a group of people, and all of the sudden, I will either get very happy, very sad, very angry, or very confused. Tonight was like a mix of everything. There were some points in the evening where I felt completely left out. Then there was a time when I just felt really angry, for no real reason. Then I felt a little upset. At some points it seemed like people were being really mean to me. I don't know what it is. It drives me fucking insane sometimes. It's probably nothing, but it made me have less fun tonight then I should have had."

"event","I went with Heather and Kirk back to BHS to check out the marching band's post-camp performance. I was in the band for all for years of high school. While I loved the music I heard, I didn't care too much for the ballad that they played. Anyway, it was so great to see all my old fello Alto Saxaphones, especially Sarah. She's the section leader now and it seems like she has alot on her plate. I knew Sarah through the last 2 years of high school, and in that time, I found myself very attracted to her. This was strange because at that time,  I was still stuck on Heather. When I saw her tonight, that attraction came right back to punch me in the face. Not that this was a bad thing, but nothing will ever come of it, simply because we are very different people. I hope to go back and visit her, and the other guys in the section, all throughout the season."

"event","There's an old saying I love so much that says ""Can't we all just get along?"" I think of this saying everytime I get mixed up in the drama of my friends. I try to keep myself out of the middle of the troubled lives of my friends, but I like trying to keep PEACE in everyone's life. Maybe I just need to realize it's not possible. On one side, I have two male friends who despise each other for various petty reasons. When one is around, the other is bashed. When I hang out with one, the other feels left out. Then there are the relationship friends. Two of my friends who at one point had a blsteringly good relationship, now stumble every day to maintain a decent, if any, friendship. It makes me so frustrated sometimes when my friends can't get along. I think I'm not alone in this opinion in life. Again I say, Can't we all just get along...?"

"event","Well, yesterday was one of my typical calm days. Heather woke me up around 11:15 which was awesome cause I love it when she gives me a wake up call. She's just got that really pleasent voice on the phone, that is, when she is in a good mood. So, after she woke me up, she arrived at my house and we hung out for a bit. 
   I guess I should probably elaborate a little more about Heather. She is my best friend of about 6 years now and I care about her so much. The biggest thing was that I had been in love with her for about 4 of those years. For reasons that I am still un-aware, we have never become more than just friends. I think it might mostly have to do with the fact that I had already entered the ""friend zone"" before I realized that I had any true feelings for her. It might also be the fact that I did a lot of stupid things early on in my ""crush"". Luckily, now we are great friends and very close and nothing will change that. I will always love her as a friend and will always be there for her.
   Anywho, after a few hours of mindless videogame playing with Heather, mainly Mario :), we went to get some food at Wendy's. I have a soft spot for their Spicy Chicken COMBO. Then, eventually, Kirk and Seth showed up and we played some more games. Then, when Heather returned from something she had to take care of, we watched Evil Dead 2. It was a terrible movie. Well, that about sums it up I guess. Just another typical day of my life :)."

"event","Well hello there everyone. I've finally decided to start one of these wonderfully entertaining, yet sometimes silly, online journals. As I sit and think about it, it enthralls me to think of how many random strangers might read about my daily life. It fascinates me to think about how many people will read about my ups, my downs, my highs, my lows, and pretty much my every thought (almost). I guess for those that don't know me, all I can say is that I lead a very crazy life. Well, I would have you believe that it is crazy. I guess the better idea would be to say that I lead a....different sort of life. The biggest reason for this is because I am legally blind. 
   Now, I know what you are probably thinking. ""Hmmm, a blind kid is making a LiveJournal. How intriguing."" Unfortunately for those thinking that, my life in that respect, is normal. Well, as normal as it can be. I have many friends, like many things, think many thoughts, and I am all around one of your typical ""nice guys"". But then there are the times when my disability can get in the way of things. Most importantly, my social life. I try to keep things normal amongst my friendships, but it's hard sometimes. I can't get into it to much without it turning into a long ramble of short nothings, but I can tell you that reading my thoughts may somehow give you the idea I want you to have about me. Hopefully I will get to update this new outward branch of my life daily, but you never know. I will try my very best"

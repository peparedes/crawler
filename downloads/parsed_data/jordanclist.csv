"event","I havent been sleeping much this last week, which is pretty sweet.

I guess i am slowly teaching my body to not need sleep, so that there are more hours in the day. 
Honestly, 6 or 7 hours sleep is pretty sweet for me. I used to need at least 10 or 11.
And that is 3 - 4 extra hours of the day. 
thats like 21 - 28 extra hours a week.
Which is like a whole day!

A whole day and a whole night a week, where i can do whatever i like. 
I do spend most of the time wasting it, doing nothing, but still...."

"event","Ok, so at the moment i'm feeling a bit pissed off.
But not really, i dont really ever get that pissed, but i guess just gutted.
Coz i've been passing the last week or so trying to figure out whether i should goto the big day out.
And when i finally decide i want to go, i get all excited about going.

Coz there's a few really cool bands that i would probably never ever EVER see in my entire life again. (Thursday, The mars volta, Metallica, etc.)
So I finally decide to go, and i'm all excited, and then i goto ask my boss today. 
Ok so it may seem that i left it late and there was no hope in getting the day off, but at my work i'm like a casual worker so i can just say 
""hey i cant come into work tomorrow, coz i'm....SLEEPING""
and they would probably say yes. I've done it before.
SO i ask and they say that the big day out day is the one biggest day ever with most work from nam. I have to shove a whole bunch of crappy Cd's onto a container to take to Hamilton. 
YAAAAAAAAAAY

OH well i'm over it, I just looked at ticketek.co.nz and there are still tickets for 'The Mars volta' who are doing a gig at the galatos next week, so I'll probly just go and see them.
Even if I'm all alone......."

"event","Ok in the light of the consistent readings of Garrick's cool journal, and of the fact that Reuben started one, i thought that i would be Mr Mccopyface and start my own journal too.

Probly no one will ever read it, maybe it's better that way and maybe i'd get too lazy to do anything, and maybe it's even better that way too.

Coz i was figuring that i'm going to italy in like 19 days (CRAP CRAP MOTHER OF OH MY GOSH!) and it would be cool while i am gallavanting around europe to be writing stuff in this diary.

But who knows, maybe this will be the only entry i ever write in my whole life.
pff i dont really care either way."

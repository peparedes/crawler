"event","She left me a month ago today.

I do not mean to focus on the subject, but after 10 years with a person, it's rather hard not to. 

Tumultuous would be a good word to describe how things have been. The outpouring of love from my friends and family, near and far, has been a comfort, to put it mildly. 

What have I decided to do? It's hard to say, honestly. On one hand, I yearn for the past that once made me so happy, and on the other, know that it's but a memory. One thing is clear: I must become a stronger person, for myself, for my son. Regardless of the future that lay ahead. For that very purpose, I've been pressing more into God, and exposing myself more to those who truly do love me, even if I can be a depressing wad of emotion from time to time. 

It gets ever so slightly easier, bit by bit. There's a distant hope for the future, regardless of what it holds. Of course, it goes without saying that I wish to reconcile my marriage for the sake of my child... but it merits also saying that I do truly love her, and wish for nothing more than to be the support that she deserves, strong and able to provide for her needs - something I've been rather poor at accomplishing for quite some time now. 

I recognize, in myself, the insecurities and anxieties that have driven me to poor judgement, and it's these very things that I intend to correct. It's not easy, and it's often hard to keep focus on my goals, given this situation, but I have no other choice. I'm no longer the impotent teenager who was once so easily grief-stricken. I have real concerns, real problems that must be dealt with. Not only for myself, but for those who love me as well. Self-validation is something that I not only deserve, but something required to move forward. 

While the subject of my prayers are unwavering, I must consider all possibilities... painful as they may be. God guide me."

"event","She left me yesterday. I guess it had been a long time coming. I don't really know what the catalyst was that made this happen, though. 

I'm in the grips of a crippling depression. It's hard to even breathe without thinking about her, wondering what I could have done differently, wondering if there's a future for us. 

So many people are praying for our marriage to succeed and pull through these hard times, and for them, I'm so very grateful. 

I've tried for months to do everything in my power to take the stress out of her life, but the further she withdrew from me, the deeper my anxiety went, and the more desperate I became to try and win her affections again. This, in turn, seemed to make her only push me away even more. 

It may well be that this is the best thing for us if there's any hope, but my heart is broken. I know that I haven't been the perfect husband, but I never dreamed I'd been so bad. 

I pray for guidance, and I pray for her to remember the good times we had and forgive me for the things I did wrong."

"event","I guess I'm a little late this time around - I usually write this on New Year's Eve. 

To call 2010 a busy year would be a significant understatement. I'm really not even sure where to begin, other than the chronological beginning. 

<lj-cut text=""Snip"">
In January of 2010, I was riding an unusual wave of confidence - things were going <i>right</i> for me - my son was healthy and had just started smiling at us, and my credit was in a position that would make me able to soon buy a home. I'd gotten a couple of certifications and by the end of the month, had gained my third. 

In February, Kristen began complaining of abdominal pain - a kind that could be explained by indigestion, but did not go away no matter how many antacids were eaten. Worse, the pain was getting worse, on an almost daily basis. 

At the beginning of March, it had gotten bad enough to warrant being seen by a doctor. A bad situation seemed to be made way worse by the misinterpretation of a side-effect of pepto-bismol. We went to the ER. The attending doctor didn't seem to have even a question in his mind as to what was wrong: gall stones. One ultrasound later, and it was confirmed. Surgery would be required for the pain to end; a prescription was ordered and an appointment was made. 

A week or so later, the prescription is running out, and the pain is getting yet worse. The scheduled out-patient surgery was at the end of the week, so the decision was made to ride it out. A day or so later, the pain escalated and she became jaundiced. The end of the week was too far away. We went back to the emergency room. 

I could write an entire post about this particular visit, but I'll sum it up: Kristen was in EXTREME pain, and the wait to be seen by a doctor was about 7 hours (triage was barely minutes). Once she was finally seen, it was only 90 minutes and two full doses of dilaudid (with barely any effect) later that an emergency procedure was being set up to removed a stone blocking her bile ducts. Admission for observation until her previously scheduled surgery was ordered. 

Kristen had her gallbladder removed on my 30th birthday. It was easily the crappiest birthday ever. My 19th birthday (working KP at Ft. Gordon) was way better. Though a little sore and medicated, I would get to take my wife home the next day. Given the previous couple of weeks, it was the best present I could hope for. 

At the end of March, a house that Kristen and I had been admiring for a little while went up on the market. In pursuit of my next certification and out of hope to find another job soon, I'd decided to postpone trying to get a mortgage to buy our first house. 

Kristen wasn't having any of that. A few weeks later, we closed on the house we'd been dreaming about. 

When you first think about it, it seems like it would be relatively easy to move into a house that's not even a quarter-mile down the same street, but let me dispel naivety  here and now: that was, without a doubt, the hardest move I've ever made. We decided to do the moving ourselves. NEVER AGAIN. Hopefully, NEVER AGAIN. I had help with the furniture, but the rest was all us. Terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible! Not getting a chance to rest was simply brutal.

The day after we completed the move-in, a storm blew threw town. Lightning took that opportunity to blow through the 40-year-old red oak in the back yard. 

The following late spring/summer was defined by record-breaking heat and back-breaking work. I'd decided to try and save some money by switching to Geico. 

Long way to go for a joke. But seriously, I decided to try and save some money by hiring someone to only cut down the tree, opting to cut it up and haul away the branches myself. I'm some sort of glutton for punishment. I'm going to have to be flat broke before I go through that again. The whole summer was a battle to try and find time that wasn't hot like the lava in Metroid and going outside to do work that made it feel that hot. 

I earned the CCENT certification in June, then left Hilton for a contract position with FedEx, participating in a product development cycle for a service named SenseAware. 

When the temperature finally broke, I still had the bulk of work to complete. With some help from Kristen's aunt Julie's family, I managed to split up most of the wood and stack it at the back of the yard. In my off time after work, I hauled branches to the street. Bit by bit, the job was getting done. 

With cooler weather, the hectic pace that pushed most of the year was finally slowing down. When I stop and recount it, I got a lot of other awesome stuff done, like painting and putting together our living room and my office, not to mention all the little things that made our house a home. 

Around the end of summer, amidst our insurance crisis, we scheduled physical exams with out doctor. Yeah....

So I had blood in my urine and Kristen had an enlarged heart and thyroid problems. In my case, I had to have an ultrasound, which found nothing, and in Kristen's case, she went to a cardiologist, who found nothing wrong. The endocrinologist, after a couple of visits, diagnosed her with Graves Disease, which actually explained a large number of other little problems we'd noticed over the previous spring/summer. 

There are so many things I haven't even gone into, like Kristen's reconnection with her mother that was broken by the return of the man who essentially drove the wedge between them even deeper, or the insurance woes we've been going through. Some things are better forgotten to time.

But all this time, I got the distinct pleasure of watching my son grow and reach new milestones in his development, most notably the transition from crawling to walking. Watching him grow makes me ever more aware of myself in profound ways. I'm grateful for this. 

The end of the year came and went sweetly. It was pretty damn nice compared to what came before it. 

So now I'm working on the CCNA certification and looking for a new job. My contract expires in a couple of weeks. I'm in limbo right now. I feel like I'm really just about ready to take the exam, but on the other hand, I really need to start searching for another job. Knowing that unemployment should be a viable option for me isn't helping a whole lot. 

We've also started attending the Life Church and have been getting involved there. After so many years of abjectly ignoring the Word and spiritual growth, we've been blessed enough to find a place we feel called to. It's amazing how much I was missing and didn't even realize it. 
</lj-cut>

So if everything I've typed so far doesn't spell it out, I've been in a reflective mood lately. I miss some old friends, and I wonder if it's possible to rebuild a burned bridge. There are things we want to explain to them, that there were a lot of strong emotions going on back then, and  just the <i>thought</i> of being looked down on... it was more than we could bear. 

But we do still care. I've taken days to write this and make sure it's been a thoughtful update. Hope you receive it, and that all is well with you."

"event","It's an amazing thing that's happened tonight. 

No matter how you feel about the results of the election, you simply cannot deny the raw power of this momentous occasion. 

I listened to two of the most powerful, heart-felt speeches I've ever heard live from any politician. McCain's concession speech was a clarion call for his supporters to move on and accept what has happened. Not only did he bow out gracefully, he clearly displayed the honor that so many have seen in him. Truly, no matter who had won, we'd have gained a great leader. 

Obama's speech was about moving forward. About returning to our great nation something we have lost: Unity. It's a simple value that I had somehow forgotten. Obama spoke words that I could have only dreamed would be uttered by the future leader of our country. In plain terms, he reminded us that we all have to work together, to live together, and to sacrifice together. Together, as a nation, we will restore ourselves to greatness.

It truly astounds me that people cannot see the beauty of this moment. I can understand wanting the party you have the most identity with to retain influence in our country's policy making, but we should all remember the patriotism that once united us and put aside petty differences. We have spoken. Change has come. The time to look at ourselves as two sides has passed, and it is time to remember that we are the same coin. 

Yes, we can."

"event","Really not sure what I've been thinking about lately.

The election preoccupies nearly every thought I have, and I'm getting sick of it. On the other hand, once the election passes, I'll be back to stressing out over the debt I recently acquired. Nothing major, but more than I'm comfortably able to handle. Kristen has been without a job for about a month, which is fine with me, especially since we live a half hour south of Memphis now. The money we've saved on gas has nearly neutralized the loss of additional income. We're still a bit shorter on money than we had before, but we're not going through what we have nearly as fast now. 

On the topic of the election, my feelings are difficult. IF I were voting, I'd be voting for Obama. The reason I am not voting is strictly a technical matter and not an apathetic condition. I forgot to re-register after moving, and the deadline slipped right past me. My bad. But even in states as red as these, a vote either way means little... not like it would in a ""toss-up"" state. 

That's the only way I can absolve myself of guilt in this historic election. Cut me some slack. 

Work is good. Been half-way studying for the Net+ exam. That's a definite ticket to promotion and a career worthy of being on my resume. I really don't even know why I haven't been pursuing that harder than I have been... I just seem to be in a fog all the time. That said, this is the first time I've actually had the drive to pursue it. It's finally happened: I've abandoned my dreams to pursue money and starting a family. I may yet write that book I've been thinking about for years... but for now, I simply do not have the time, or really, the motivation to do it. When I get a decent schedule again, that may change. But for now, I'm not even going to fool myself into thinking there's a future in writing/video editing/anything entertainment or art related. 

I've also given up on the idea of college. This could be a terribly ignorant decision, but if I get these certifications I have my eyes set on, I'm going to be doing pretty well for myself in a couple of years or so. I work with people with college degrees who have nothing to do with them. So far, I have yet to see a compelling reason to go to college when a comparable amount of experience will serve just as well. I'm not doing anything critical for society, anyway. At least I can be making money instead of spending it. 

Of course, all of this is subject to change if I were to lose this job. 

Kristen and I went to see Avenue Q in Nashville this past week. We missed our chance to see it when it was here last month, and Kristen's birthday was on the 19th, so it gave us something to do. Also got to take advantage of my work discount at the doubletree in downtown Nashville. It was a nice little trip. 

The last line of Avenue Q is especially poignant: Everything in life is only for now. On one hand, it makes me bemoan the transience of existence, yet on the other hand, if offers some hope. Life just makes my head hurt, sometimes."

"event","Well, we got all moved. I tell you what, the whole ordeal was a complete pain in the ass. I've had to do a lot of moving in my life, and that's probably why we were able to complete this so quickly, but just the same, if *sucked*. 

Remember the cool(ish) weather we'd been having a couple of weeks back? Highs in the 80's, low humidity? Pleasant breeze? Gone. Every single iota. Highs in the upper 90's, high humidity, NO BREEZE. I must have sweat a liter or more the day of the move. BUT, we got everything that hadn't been done, DONE. That day. It was a first for me, completing a move the day it was expected to be done when we were most of the labor. 

We had a moving company come and move the furniture. It cost a pretty penny, and I was quite displeased with the attitudes of the movers, but it was all worth it. Our last two moves had been entirely handled by Kristen's dad's moving company, but ever since her parents divorced, let's just say the relationship between father and daughter has been... strained. So, we had to do it ourselves. 

The last couple of weeks have been pleasantly cathartic. Something about this has strengthened mine and Kristen's bond. It's been a while since I've felt this good about myself. It's amazing what a change of scenery can do for a person. 

I was told tonight at work by a supervisor tonight that I needed to apply for a permanent position at Hilton. I've been waiting on this for three and a half painful months. That goofy 5p-1:30a schedule played hell on my life. The schedule's changed, now they want to hire me on permanently which comes with a raise and corporate benefits. 

I finally got my computer fixed, replaced the powersupply, now it will actually power on. It was also an upgrade in power, 300w to 400w. Now it actually behaves in a manner consistent with the hardware I installed. For quite a while, I've been thinking I totally failed at building this rig, which I did, but it's only because I went cheap on the powersupply. Significantly happier with it now, but I'd like to double my ram and get a dual core processor now, except both of those require a new motherboard. It may well be time to just buy brand name units again. Hardware prices have fallen into a range where it's almost pointless to build your own rig to save money. 

I also got a PS3 and MGS4. Bliss. 

Kristen got a 2008 Civic. Yet more Bliss. 

Damn, I didn't realize it until I typed it out just now, but things have been going pretty well. 

Obviously, we have the internet back now. 

And to top it all off, I'm off for the next two days. 

Good times."

"event","...and yet I post. Will wonders never cease?

So, reasonably large update to make, though I'll condense it as much as possible. 

I went and saw the new Indiana Jones movie last night. I was pleasantly surprised! Here, I'd thought they'd forgotten how to make a good adventure flick. Lord knows, I haven't seen a good one since... well, Last Crusade. It will definitely find it's way to my DVD collection, possibly as my first Blu-Ray purchase. 

MGS4 has come out and OMG... I still haven't played it. Don't have the money for a PS3. Go figure. I would have had one by now, except I'm moving in a week, so I've had to conserve my funds as much as possible. Where am I moving? About a half-to-three-quarters hour drive south, in Hernando, MS. Don't make that face, I'd never willfully make that choice. The truth is, Kristen's mom bought some land that she'd like to build a house on, and it just so happened to already have a house on it(it's a 10 acre property). The house isn't much, 3 beds and 1.5 baths, but it's just what Kristen and I have been needing. Can't have kids in a one bedroom apartment. Well, I suppose you could, but that's just semantics. 

It's all brick, and has been reasonably maintained by people who <i>seem</i> to know what they're doing, but it's still in need of some work. For instance, the room that will become the guest bedroom is currently pink. Not some light shade, either. We're talking honest-to-God <b>crayola</b> pink. Any portion of the house that is not a bedroom is also floored in tiles. The first time I saw the place a month or so ago, they looked stark white. Like #000000 white. Inspecting them again tonight as we moved the first few things in, we realized they actually have a slightly peachy hue. I've never been so happy to see a peachy hue. We can WORK with that. The kitchen is the house's centerpiece, though. Marble counters(real, full marble), white cabinets, double sink, double oven, stainless steel accents. It's sharp. 

A farmer's life for me? Well, I won't be worrying about harvesting the lower 40 before the rain comes, but I have a tractor to mow the lawn. I may shed the pasty white yet! Also, Michael (Karen's new husband... LONG story) is expecting me to help him maintain the property, which includes, but isn't limited to: fence mending, horse maintenance, general building, property care... it's way more than I'm used to. Let me put it this way: the way I sweat today is a way in which I've sweat only a couple of times since Basic Training, and all I did was take the seats out of a van and load some boxes into it. 

All in all, I'm excited about it. It's a place to shape and mold as I see fit. It's actually something I've longed for... ever since I lived in Brownsville, helping my dad build that split rail fence. I didn't realize it then, but I actually loved it. Doing things with my hands, I mean. Mastering the fundamentals of civilized life. <i>Building</i>.

Of course, what's a farm without crops? We won't have fields, but there's already a garden out there with tomatoes and eggplants, and probably some other stuff we haven't yet identified, in addition to a fig tree, peach trees, plum trees, blackberry bushes, and a pear tree. Combine this with chickens and horses, and it's gonna be all hee-haw around our place. 

On another note, work is going meh. I'm sure my performance is okay, but since the moving news, I just really don't care that much. I almost hope they decide not to hire me so I can look for employment closer to where I'll be living. I'm not inviting it, but let's just say I wouldn't be too busted up about it. I should be hearing something in the next couple of weeks. 

I can't wait to have people down to see the place. I'm sure I'll throw some kind of party in the days following the completion of the move, but we have to make the move happen. 

In any case, I'll likely post more as it happens, as I'm sure I'll want to remember these times. Writing here also seems to help me write on my own, which has been sorely lacking, especially since my typing got so much faster from work."

Long story short: Today makes one year since I quit smoking, yesterday was my 28th birthday, and I got a new job today. I'll be working at Hilton for at least the next three months. We'll see how it goes. I'm quite pleased to be leaving Flextronics after the hell I've been through with them, but it's been valuable experience, and I do still feel a slight tinge of sadness over having to leave. But it's necessary, and few people will miss me, I'm sure. 

Anyway, there's lots more to be said given how long it's been since my last post, but nothing earth shattering... so perhaps another day? 

Also, I'm on myspace, so add me if you haven't already - myspace.com/anti_otaku 

I have a blog on IGN, too, but I don't post to it much, and it's mostly for my video game stuff, anyway... just in the off chance someone IS interested - blogs.ign.com/andymion

All for now. Be sure to tune in next year when I make my ""Oh, SHIT, I'm 29 now??"" post."

Officially, it *is* my last day.

Behind the scenes, though: I'm in limbo about the new job. I love it, don't get me wrong... but I'm still training. The instructor has already said that he would be 'thinning the herd' (my words, not his) come Tuesday. I do not know the criteria upon which he'll be basing his decision, but let's just say I'm not completely confident that I will survive the process. Even if I do, there's still a certification test on Friday. While I'm comfortable in what I have learned, nothing has been guaranteed. Provided that I DO get that far, I have to produce the expected numbers (1 unit/hour) within one month.

I'm not down on myself here; I KNOW I'm capable of pulling this off... let's just say the instructor is not exactly slanted in my favor. Not that he's against me, I just normally can get a sense of my standing in situations like this. I can't tell at all now, and I'm taking absolutely nothing for granted. 

Those things said, I asked Peter today to wait on pulling me off the schedule completely. One thing is for sure: no matter how much I hate working in the hospitality industry, I cannot afford to be without a job. He told me that if I needed it, I could keep working there, albeit only three days a week. I've already been replaced. lol It's better than nothing, and gives me ample time off to look for something else.

Also: 94 hours since my last cigarette. This sucks! Especially right now, since I'm drinking, but I feel so much healthier. My chest is lighter, my sense of smell is sharper, and I can taste things more acutely. It's fucking wild.

The doctor leaned back in his chair, and with a knowing smile, replied, ""That's an easy one. You're afraid of change!""</i>


It just hit me how many things are in a state of change in my life right now. There are three major things that have begun this week, none of which I was really aware was coming. 

1) (most obvious) I have a new job. What I didn't know was that it would force me to leave Bonefish sooner than I expected. I will probably continue to work Saturdays there for a little while to keep my benefits up. 

2) I finally made the actual decision to quit smoking. I've been taking Chantix for 6 days now. My cravings are getting much easier to handle... and cigarettes really kinda suck now. It's so strange. I want a cigarette out of habit, but I don't actually desire one. My quit date is March 13. One full day left. 

3) Kristen was moved to another grooming salon. She now works in Bartlett, as the only groomer in that Petco. It's a pretty amazing opportunity. 

Yesterday was our last day to ride into work together. From here on out, we'll be going different ways at largely incompatible times. It's disappointing. That's what we've been doing for over four years. I'm unexpectedly sad about that fact. We'll have to get a second cellphone as soon as possible. 

I'm leaving the restaurant industry. That's all I've known for four years. I honestly don't remember what it's like to work in other environments. This is something that will be completely new to me... it might even be a legit career opportunity. I'm so nervous, I can barely relax. 

I took the Prelude back from my parents today. I don't know how long I'll keep it before I let them have it again, but we gave it a badly needed washing, inside and out, put oil in it, refilled the coolant, and put in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner. It runs much better now, but is still in need of serious work, including body repair. 

I guess that's all for now. I'll expect the worst while hoping for the best. 

Oh yeah, I'll be 27 tomorrow. 3 cubed. *shiver*"

Peter, Darrell, and whomever else it does concern,

	This notice is to serve as my letter of resignation from Bonefish Grill. My final day will be Wednesday, March 14, 2007. This is due to the fact that I have been given an opportunity more in line with my interests and skill sets, and should not be construed as 'rage-quitting'. I offer my sincerest apologies for not being able to provide a full two week notice, as it was my full intention to do so, but my new employers are pushing for me to begin on Friday, March 16. 

	As a side note to the start date at my new job, they had originally wanted me to begin on Friday, March 9. It took serious persuasion on my part to get them to move the date back as far as they did. Also, I have set my last date at Bonefish to a Wednesday to coincide with the end of that week's pay period, and to allow myself time to prepare for my new duties. 

	I have worked at Bonefish for just shy of two years. While there are others who have been there longer, I've spent the most consecutive time here compared to all other jobs I've held. This speaks volumes for the quality of the work environment in the face of any complaining I may have done otherwise. I have enjoyed my schedule, job functions, and most importantly, the people around me. It does sadden me to leave Bonefish, but this move is, I feel, important to advancing myself as an individual, and brings my wife and I closer to being able to start a family.

	Again, I just want to express that this is not about personal conflicts with others in the restaurant, as has been the case with some who have left in the past. The timing of my departure may also seem suspicious, but it is almost purely coincidental. I am sorry if it appears otherwise. 

	I do not know what will happen in the future, and could very well one day find myself in need of this job again for one reason or the other. For this reason, I wish only to leave Bonefish in good standing, eligible for rehire should the need ever arise. 

	Thank you for your time, consideration, and cooperation. 

	Sincerely,
	      Charles A. Overton (P&D, AM Prep Crew)"

"event","Well, yesterday went pretty well. I spent almost three hours testing and filling out application paperwork. The interview even went well! 

I was expecting to have a urinalysis, since that's the standard for drug screening, but it was a mouth swab instead. That's kinda generous, honestly. As far as I know (which could very well not be terribly far), those can only test for recent use. They just wanted to make sure no one got high and came in to fill out an application, it almost seems. And yes, I passed it. 

Anyway, I'll have a final interview sometime next week. So far, so good. Based on past experience with getting jobs in work-farm environments, the final interview is a formality... something you can get through as long as you don't walk in a puke on their desk. 

Hmm... that could be a problem, too.

"event","Ever been caught in a moment that feels like an eternity? 

The kind where the previous moment felt like it meant nothing, but you find out that it does... and know that the next minute is somewhere in the single digits of most important things to happen to you? 

Let me explain. 

Tomorrow, I go for an interview for a job that will bring me closer to a career I actually do not mind. It's repairing Apple laptops. The details are actually not important to me... the only thing that matters is that it's my ticket out of the restaurant industry... at least for now. Provided that I can get back into school, such a job might be helpful... but for now, as I'm trying to establish a financial foundation to make such things happen in my life... well... it's just what I need. 

To say that I'm nervous is quite the understatement. I don't think any job interview has ever weighed so much to me. If I manage to get any sleep tonight, it will be a rather large blessing. 

On the other hand, about the aforementioned ""previous moment"": Bonefish has been pretty good to me through the last couple of years. I've made a few good friends, and I doubt I've ever laughed more in a work environment. Certainly, when my brother died, these people did what they could to help me get through those tough times. No job I've ever had has made me feel so welcome, and at times, even appreciated. 

But whether or not I get the job tomorrow, lot's of this is going to end. My kitchen manager, Matt, is moving back to Slidell, Louisiana. I've never felt closer to a co-worker. Our similarities outnumber our differences, and the majority of my laughter at work has been shared with him. 

Actually, what's funny about this, is that the day after he told me he was going to take over his old restaurant at the request of the owner, another friend of mine reminded me about this job that I'm currently going after. I initially tried to get this job back in November, but the woman in charge of hiring disregarded my resume and would not listen to me about how my experience qualifies me for the job. This time, it's different. I actually got an interview! lol

Anyway, I'm rambling, so I'll cut this off. I'm saddened that a friend is leaving, but I'm given hope by the opportunity to make such a major change in my life. 

Prayers would be appreciated."

"event","So, I'm working on cutting up lettuce for salad this morning. I look up and notice a small moth sitting on the stainless steel shelf over my sink. This is pretty common, strangely enough. Not seeing a moth on the shelf, but seeing various small insects running around my work area (like it or not, it's inevitable in any restaraunt that uses fresh produce). I usually catch them and release them through the back door. It's not their fault they wound up in an environment where they'd normally be killed on site. I've released several ladybugs (they commonly ride in on the parsley). 

I ignored the moth, he was fine where he was. I finished cutting lettuce and cleaned out the sink (I wash the lettuce after I cut it and before putting it up on the line). A few minutes later, I notice the moth has disappeared, then notice him lying on his back in the drain, his wings saturated. It was time to get him outside before he got killed and thrown in the trash. 

Normally, this would be plenty, but it was cloudy, rainy, and cold. I knew immediately that this wouldn't be as simple as it usually is. I gently put him on the ground. With all the struggling he was doing, he immediately put himself back on his back. I gently flipped him over, and had to return to work. 

Twice more I checked on him as I took smoke breaks. Both times, I found him on his back. He tried to right himself, but with his wings already wet, he was stuck to the wet ground. He'd deffinately not survive at this rate. I paced around for a minute, trying to figure out how to improve his condition. Taking him back inside was out of the question, and my vehicle was parked on the other side of the building. The guys would think I was batshit insane if I walked through the building carrying an injured moth to do anything buy throw it away. 

The rain hadn't actually been to bad up until this point, so there were still dry patches of asphalt under the vehicles that were parked back there. Getting him there was another problem. I'm afraid I may have injured him further trying to handle him, and as far as I'd have to walk to get him there he might wind up dead in the process, between his struggling to get free and my determination to keep him in hand. I needed something to put him in, but what? 

I took a drag off of my cigarette. Wait, the cigarette pack! Well, no... still has cigarettes in it. I paced some more. 

Finally it dawned on me: the celophane wrapper. I quickly removed the wrapper from the pack and nudged it in. I walked around to the vehicles and tried to set him underneath. As I set him down, the wind picked up and blew it away, coming to rest in water again. This wasn't gonna work. I walked to another vehicle, one that was more shielded from the wind, and tried again. Then I remembered that the reason the moth was in his predicament in the first place was because he was stuck to the wet ground. The same worked for the celophane: face the opening towards the dry ground and place the wet side on some wet ground. The moth carrier stayed in place. Satisfied, I returned to work. 

I almost forgot about him. As I left work, I realized as I pulled out of my parking space about the little guy I'd been preoccupied with most of my shift. I drove around the building to check on him. I found the celophane, in the place I left it, but did not find the moth. I looked around, and found him a couple of feet away. His wings had dried out, but he was not moving around. I was afraid he'd died. I lightly touched him, and he started squirming around again, so I scooped him back into the celophane and put him in the truck, in a hidden cupholder so he'd be safe. 

Right now he's on my balcony. I know it's probably too cold for him, but if he recovered inside the apartment, he wouldn't survive long once the cats noticed him. I turned the balcony light on, hoping to motivate him to try flying. I gave him a leaf to try and get him to eat. So far, he's done nothing. He's still alive, I just checked on him... but there's nothing else I can do. I've done literally everything I can imagine to save him. Now we'll just have to see what happens. 

I have no idea why I've taken such steps to try and save something as trivial as a moth... but it feels kinda good. I just wanted to do for something what I'd want to be done for me should I have been in a similar situation, literally or figuratively. I'll pray, and then I can only wait."

I'm not a particularly superstitious person, but this has been a weird day. Perhaps not weird so much as eventful and a deffinate departure from the normal routine. 

Wii pre-orders began today. In fear of mobs of campers waiting to get a part of the extremely limited allotment of Wiis that would be available for purchase, Kris and I were compelled to go to our local EB games early and wait for the store to open. How early am I talking about? 

...

3:00 AM. 

I probably don't have to say that we were the first people there... for about 4 hours. The store doesn't even open until 10. Fortunately, it wasn't one of those situations where we had to literally be standing at the door to be the first ones in. The manager, Karen, had the foresight to hand out cards with numbers on them for the people who were there. This actually created an almost social atmosphere, where I spoke not only with other fanboys, but also with parents who only knew this was what their child wanted for Christmas. It was pretty neat to share information that was basically old hat with folks who only knew Nintendo was a console maker. 

When they finally opened for business, Kris and I went straight in and placed our pre-order. We're the first on the list. 

Was my fear of a mob justified? Not entirely. I only saw one person be turned away because the demand had met the supply... and this was 15 minutes before they opened. I heard from other people there, though, that the other stores in the area had over 20 people hanging out waiting to get one. The problem there was that there were less than 18 available even at the most well stocked locations. 

It's an experience to remember, even though we waaay jumped the gun. We'd decided to go out so early thanks to a phone call I got yesterday from the store in Collierville, informing me that they only had 14 for pre-order and over 60 people on the call list that they were informing. That planted a very firm image in my mind reminiscent of the Xbox 360 launch last year. I just wanted to be safe. :)

So, after this was done, we went to pay rent, and renewed our lease on this apartment for another year. I'm not entirely happy about that, but it was the cheapest option, and we really can't afford to move, anyway. Regardless of how I feel about this apartment, it's a place to live, and that's better than being on the streets. 

I also got a call from my friend Phil who was talking about a job he'd just got. It seems like a job that could spell a major change in my life, primarily by getting me out of the restaurant industry. I'll follow up on that later, if things work out. Don't wanna jinx things yet. 

We took a decent nap this afternoon to compensate for the sleep we didn't get early this morning, then went to work on cleaning the apartment. That leads up to here and now. I'll probably be up for a little while longer, then I'll try to end this <i>different</i> day with some good sleep."

"event","Spent the last few days wading through the COMPASS practice tests on <a href=""http://www.testprepreview.com/compass_practice.htm"">testprepreview.com</a>. Whew. Some fairly exhausting tests going on here. I'm not entirely sure if these are actually valid tests, considering later tests use questions already seen in other sections, not to mention the basic, intermediate, and advanced math sections seem to completely undercut the previous algebra sections. For my own purposes, here are my results with notes on what I need to study up on. 

<lj-cut>

Basic Algebra - 16/20 - 80%
Advanced Algebra - 12/14 - 86%
Averages and Rounding - 11/12 - 92%  (look up medians [average of highest and lowest])
Basic Operations - 7/8 - 88%
Commas - 10/10 - 100%
Estimation and Sequencing - 8/10 - 80% (pay attention to math, idiot)
Exponents - 5/6 - 83%
Fractions and Square Roots - 12/15 - 80% (pay attention to math)
Geometry - 3/5 - 60% (look up basic geometry again)
Graphs and Charts - 15/16 - 94% (careless)
Basic Grammar - 19/21 - 91% (study use of hyphens)
Intermediate Grammar - 13/21 - 62% (use of laid/lain/lay, plurals and[with] verbs, tenses of 'to be')
Advanced Grammar - 17/20 - 85% (watch out for spelling)
BaSIC Math - 35/40 - 88% (carelessness)
Intermeidate Math - 37/40 - 93% (re-study: 17, 25)
Advanced Math - 36/40 - 90% (worthless, repeats previous questions)
Measurement - BROKEN
Percents and Ratios - 19/20 - 95% (also worthless, lots of repeats and one question without correct answer as option)
Basic Reading Comprehension - 33/45 - 73% (exhaustive, boring)
Reading for the Main Idea - 6/10 - 60% (repetitive answers, trouble paying attention at this point)
Advanced Reading Comprehension - SKIPPED
Sentence Correction 1 - 16/20 - 80% 
Sentence Correction 2 - 17/21 - 81%

</lj-cut>

TOTALS - 347/414 - 84%
	*MATH - 216/246 - 89%
	*ENGLISH - 131/168 - 78%

Also, this test took WAY too long. I worked at it in my free time for three days, spending probably 7 hours total on it. According to a FAQ I found about the compass, it's self-driven, and to allow about 2 hours for it... so I'm guessing the actual test is not a 400+ question behemoth. 

On the positive side, math concepts that I had forgotten about were much easier for me to retain this time around after looking up ways to work the problems out. Granted, there are a few more concepts I need to hit again (like percentages... damn stuff drives me crazy), but overall, I feel better about what I actually retain 8 years later. 

There are official practice questions for this test availible on ACT.org, which I've downloaded and have sitting on my desktop, but I'm in need of a break after the mental stonewalling I've gone through the last few nights. I already know there is content in these tests that I don't have a hope of getting correct, but as I understand it, not all of the questions are for evaluating basic high-school knowledge, but also for possibly testing out of college-level courses. I just hope I understand this correctly."

"event","I have a baaad habit of ignoring this poor thing. I won't lie and say I'll try to be better about it, though... mostly because I probably won't. 

I've mentioned it before and failed to act then, so this will probably be ignored now, but I'm getting a pretty clear picture in my head as to how I will attack higher education. I've spent the last day looking very heavily into school and trying to chart my path to getting through, and so far I've gotten much further into the actual planning than I did last time, when all I did was take a look at a couple of sites for local colleges. 

I'm still interested in the <a href=""https://umdrive.memphis.edu/g-communication/www/filmvideo/index.html"">Film & Video Production</a> concentration at the U of M, but I've been scared of the remedial classes I'll have to take just to get there. 

Today, I looked into the actual <a href=""http://academics.memphis.edu/bulletin/cfa.html#comm"">course requirements</a> and discovered it wasn't as scary as I'd originally thought. Think of a nightmare that involves drowning in a sea of numbers and you'll have the basic point. I'm good with numbers, but I'm terrible at math. If it's more complex than oh, say the pythagorean theorum, I'm all googly-eyed. English, outside of the strictest grammar classes, I have few problems with, and Spanish isn't even that bad for me. All that's really left are a bunch of classes that I don't know if I'll do well in or not, but I'm certainly willing to ""give it the old college effort"". 

Taking things a step further, I looked into classes at South West Tennessee Community College, in an effort to find cheaper General Education. I found an associate's degree that will fit the bill nicely in <a href=""http://www.southwest.tn.edu/arts/"">Fine Arts</a>. The kicker here, however is <a href=""http://www.enrollment.memphis.edu/Admissions/EQ-Table/Tables/stcc05.htm"">this</a>. All of the classes transfer to U of M, and with perhaps one or two exceptions, satisfies all General Education requirements for the B.A. I want. To say the least, I'm very pleased. 

So, why did I start looking this stuff up and begin actually taking it seriously? Well, ever since the wedding, I've been extremely dissatisfied with my current position. I'm barely making enough to make ends meet, and I don't want to rely on Kris to have to bring home the bacon, which she's lined up to do once she has her grooming certification. That's not to mention the possibility of raising a family. 

The other day, Kristen's aunt asked why I didn't considering going to ITT Tech or a similar ""hand's on"" school... a question I couldn't answer. So, I did what I've had a habit of doing lately every time I have a question for which I can't supply an answer, I Google it. After hours of exhaustive searching and forum reading, I reached the general consensus that not only is it an extremely expensive school with (largely) terrible teaching and grading standards, but most hiring managers consider a degree from ITT or any such similar school to be virtually worthless. What reason is there for me to pay upwards of $65K or more for a bachelor's degree that will be instantaneously disregarded? I couldn't think of one. The obvious next step was to look into the more popular, more recognized, and less expensive alternative, as I've stated above. 

I tried to give a call today to my buddy Ben, only to find he's already left for the 'sandbox'. I'm saddened by this, and will pray for his safe and timely return (hopefully in six months). 

Rest In Peace, Steve Irwin. I always thought of him as a crazy animal guy and joked that it would be the death of him, but I didn't imagine it would happen so soon. Strangely, I miss him. At least it was quick and very likely painless."

"event","Windows NT 6.0, the official OS deffinition of Windows Vista. 

That's pretty important to note, because when you boot into Vista the first time, you're greeted by an interface very similar to uber-tweaked window-blinds Mac-OSX themes. To that extent, the entire taskbar as well as window borders are 'glass' in appearance. Not just a shiny exterior, but you can actually vaguely see the wallpaper of the desktop through it. That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as GUI improvements go. This is a much larger step than the one from 2K to XP. 

I can't believe I think this, but IE7+ is damn near superior to the current Firefox, at least so far as basic function is concerned. So far, I haven't seen a way to add functionality like Firefox, but the major things here (speed, search bar, tabs) are executed very well. Also conspicuous is the lack of menu bar, but those functions have been redistributed around the window. It's pretty slick, really. 

Back to the OS itself, as I was saying this is NT 6.0. Everything about 5.0 is still here, just sometimes in different places, other times in a different layout. Command lines are still present, but not added by default to the start menu. A simple change of properties can rectify that. 

It is deffinitely more resource hungry than XP, I must say. The greater pull on my system has not been terribly noticable, though, and Guild Wars actually seems to run more smoothly. Premiere is still quite responsive, though I haven't had time to give it a good stress test yet. 

Basically, the OS is worth a shot if you have the time and ability to run it. This beta release is apparently valid until May 31 of 2007, so I'll have a pretty good idea of whether or not I'll want it immediately after it's final release.

"event","Got the rent paid today... had to take out a title loan to do it, but it wasn't huge, so maybe we won't have such a terrible time trying to pay it back. 

In order to keep the post light-hearted, I think I'll talk about my favorite pastime: Video Games. YaaaaAAAAaaay!!

<lj-cut text=""Cut for your enjoyment."">

I've been playing a lot of GW: Factions, lately. Shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. I've made two new characters and remade one of the others. One of the new characters is an Assassin/Ranger, and the other is a Ritualist/Necromancer. 

There has been a trend with the flood of new players in the wake of the Factions release, and the majority of them have made Assassins. The major drawback of this is the fact that making balanced parties is now extremely difficult for Pick Up Groups. I haven't played with mine for weeks now because of that. I'll probably play more with her later, once the rush has calmed down. 

I've spent the most time with my ritualist lately. This is my first time playing a dedicated caster, so it's been like a whole new experience. I'm only used to dealing direct, focused damage. Not only am I playing a dedicated caster, but I've actually used the majority of points in an attribute of my secondary profession... so, I've made a ritualist minion master. 

Getting into the math of it, because that's what you do when you've become an otaku of an ORPG, I've maxed out my death magic attribute, and use that to raise minions. From corpses. At level 12 (max without runes), I make level 10 minions, which have 280 hp each. This is fairly weak in the scope of the game, as the majority of the areas have &lt; level 20 monsters, so many would die in as little as two or three attacks, depending on the enemies I'm fighting. This brings me to the attribute I have the second most amount of points in: Spawning magic. Spawning is an 'inactive' attribute. It has few skills applied to it, but raising levels in it increases the hp of anything I spawn by 4%/level. So, at level 12 (11 plus 1 point from a minor rune), they have an additional 48% health. 414 hp in total. 

They recently nerfed minion masters by limiting the amount of minions you may have. For a necro primary, 10 are allowed at 12 levels of death magic, and 8 for a necro secondary. I can produce 2 minions for every corpse I exploit, so it does not take long to produce a meat shield that can take 3,312 points of damage. That's pretty nice not only for me, but also the party I'm in. A dedicated necro can only make a shield that's worth 2,800. I think I've stumbled upon a nice build. 

The third attribute that the remainder of my points are used by is Restoration magic. Not only can I heal myself, I can raise dead allies. After I get minions out of their cold bodies. Muahahaha.

I haven't seen any other Rit/Necro builds in the lists I look at, but I have a feeling I'll be very useful to any party, as I'm also fairly self-sufficient. I'll have to post more as I find out.

Of course, this past week was E3. In years past, I've fixated on the new Metal Gear trailer, and this year, there was of course a new trailer for Guns of the Patriots. It was absolutely fantastic, quite depressing, though. It was easy to not watch it too often, especially in the light of other new things at this event. 

This year, we will officially be deposited into the next generation of consoles. Of course, there's the $500 heavyweight, the PS3. I find myself increasingly annoyed with Sony and there stance that their products are bar-none the best things ever. I'm a bit upset by the mentality they have adopted with the console being a multi-media powerhouse. I do NOT need a Blu-ray player until that has become the established standard. Personally, I'm thinking that they just want to force the technology into our homes. Otherwise, they'd be guaranteed to lose, what with their technology being more expensive and less friendly than the alternative, HD-DVD. 

The big winner of this show was overwhelmingly Nintendo and their mystery machine, the Wii. There's little to say here, so if you don't know anything about it, head to <a href=""http://wii.ign.com"">http://wii.ign.com</a>.

To me, the biggest news of the show was the new Smash Brothers, as evidenced by <a href=""http://andymion.livejournal.com/53418.html"">a previous post I made</a>. I can not wait for that game to come out. 


I find myself with lots of games to play and not enough time to play them in, lately. In addition to Factions, I'm still playing Kingdom Hearts II, Metal Gear Acid 2, and MGS3: Subsistence. Factions is demanding the majority of my time, so I'll get to the others as I'm ready for a break. At least I'm not going to be bored for a while. 

Oh yeah, I still need to return DQVIII so I can actually finish <i>that </i>game. Wow. I've got a lot to keep me occupied through the summer months. Bonus!

"event","a.k.a. Mother's Day 2006

Wow, where do I begin <i>this</i> sordid little tale? 

This is my first day off in eight days. It was on the first day that I learned it would be such a stretch, with Mother's Day falling on the next to last day. This is not what you would call a <i>good sign</i>. Anyone in the restaraunt industry can tell you that the particular day in question is the <b>paramount</b> of business, and being in prep, my buildup to it begins three days in advance. 

<lj-cut text=""*snip*"">
Let me rewind and show you the mindset I've had coming into the week. It's interesting to note just how shitty this was. 

Unless you're a total n00b to my FL, you know I just got married. Well, even with her parents covering the vast majority of the bills, this is still an expensive process. I have not been able to pay my rent on time sense then. Of course, what do newlyweds do after getting married? Have a honeymoon! Which means what, again? Unpaid time off! (well, for us, anyway) I don't know how drunk I was when I tried to figure out the math concerning when this would catch up to us on our paychecks, but I was <i>convinced</i> it would fall on the end of the month, a time of relative safety in the bills department. Nope. 

It caught up to us the first week of this month, and it has dealt quite the damaging blow to our finanaces. My phone has been off for two weeks (for the first time in a couple of years), and I still haven't paid rent. I collect a check tomorrow, but I'm not completely sure I'll have enough to get rent paid even then. I'll probably have to take out another title loan... and I have no idea what I'm going to do to get that paid back at this rate. 

Anyway, back to the story at hand, I've been walking around with this knowledge during the entirity of the aforementioned eight day stretch. 

On Thursday (day 4 of 8), we were given the largest prep list we've had in months, probably the heaviest of the year. At the same time, we were due for the largest truck of the year at a whopping two hundred nineteen pieces. We lose nearly an hour putting this truck away, and we're way behind on time. Because of the sheer volume of product we're supposed to produce, we're using up way more dishes and utensils than we normally do. I mean really, is nine and a half gallons of bang sauce actually necessary? For those who do not know, bang sauce is mostly mayonaise. Just how much, exactly? Nine of those nine and a half gallons. <strike>The rest is lemon juice and Thai chili pepper sauce.</strike>

At 3:30, the Health Inspector shows up. Needless to say, we got boned (pun intended). We did not fare well at all. I'll spare the details, but we got reamed up one side and down the other for two days by management because of it.

Saturday did not go so badly. The plan was to do the bulk of our necessary prep on that day, so we could have it [relatively] easy the following day. After a ten hour shift, I clocked out, feeling pretty good about the work I'd done and the fact that the GM was finally off our case. 

Saturday's are notoriously busy. Even so, ten thousand dollars in sales is a pretty considerable night. Our quotas had far exceeded that in hopes of removing work from the following day. 

We did over thirteen thousand in business. Our safety net went up in fish odoured flames. 

I arrive the next morning at seven AM to find the largest prep list I've ever seen. In the end, I'd cut up nine and a half cases of lettuce, prepared fifty lobster tails, peeled ten pounds of 16/20 shrimp, battered two hundred coconut shrimp, wrapped forty-eight scallops in bacon, de-spored, cut, and portioned ten pounds of portabella mushrooms, as well as a host of other things I'd had assistance with. Actually, Drew did the lobster tails for me, as it took three hours just to complete the <i>first </i>task. 

Upon completing my list, the store had been open for three hours, and we'd already begun running low on things. I started pulling things out to have more prep done, though I had no intention of doing it. This was actually because the GM wanted us gone by the time the store had opened. Once it looked sufficiently like we'd saved the store from total meltdown as soon as we left, we threw in the towel. Drew and Matt got out much quicker than I did. As I went to clock out, I hear this:

""Hey, Andy, you don't have anywhere to be, do you?"" 

<b>FUCK.</b>

I told the GM I still needed to go see my mother, as well as my mother-in-law. He told me I could go on and go, and I stumbled to the back door as quickly as I could (my legs were incredibly sore). Once out, I lit a cigarette and was thankful to finally be out of the hellhole. 

Then my concience kicked in. I immediately felt guilty for taking off without doing something else to help. We'd just had three people quit in us. I stomped the ground and flailed my arms in the air, because I knew I was about to go clock back in. Heck, Matt was going home just long enough to clean himself up and was then coming back. 

I went back in and got stuck in the ""dish hole"". The poor guy scheduled to work there had had his partner quit in him, so he was by himself and drowning fast. I spent thirty to forty-five minutes helping him get back up to sea level when I could no longer take it. Carrying those heavy stacks of insanely hot dishes hurt the crap out of my lower back. I pulled it so bad I could feel it in my feet. I went and clocked out again, stole more than my share of the wraps we'd ordered for lunch, took three of the chocolate covered strawberries that they were giving the mothers, and snuck out the back door before I could get flagged into something else. 

Kristen got off of work shortly thereafter, and we went to see my mom. In addition to one of the strawberries, Kristen had bought a card and a box of Hershey's chocolate for both of our mom's. I sat on mom's couch with a dead expression on my face, and she laughed at me. She told me I could go on and go home, which I did. I then took a nap. 

I woke up a little before eight PM, feeling more rested, but now my back was tight. I had a hard time getting up, and all I could do was whine to Kristen about the pain. I eventually got sick of just sitting there, so I stood up and just dealt with the pain. We went to see Kristen's mom, but we got out of there quickly, so I did not have to be uncomfortable for long. 

The next morning, I got to work a little after nine. As I pulled into the parking lot, I got a sinking feeling, even before I got there. I pulled up to find trash strewn all around the dumpster (with a sizable portion actually <u>outside</u> of the dumpster pad). As I walked to the back door, Drew greeted me with this:

""Welcome to the worst close in Bonefish history."" 

The. Store. Was. A. WRECK. 

<b>Unbelievable. </b>After all the talk about the time we had on Thursday not being an excuse for the store being in the condition it was in, we came into conditions that were not only unsanitary, but would have closed the store for a week or more if the health inspector had shown up that morning. To add insult to injury, beer had been bought for the back-of-house guys, and we couldn't even get a simple ""Thanks"" out of our GM. 

We spent three hours cleaning after the truck had come and gone. 

On the Monday after Mother's Day, the antithesis to the day itself, the day I should have had the shortest amount of time spent at work, I did not get off the clock until after 4:30 PM. 

I really have to wonder why I put up with this place. I'm just grateful I got through without quitting. </lj-cut>

Maybe I'll write more tomorrow on a lighter note."

War has changed. 

It's not about nations, or ideologies. It's not even about profit, resources, or ethnicity.

War has changed. 

ID-tagged soldiers carry ID-tagged weapons, use ID-tagged gear. 

Nanomachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their actions.

War has changed. 

When the battlefield is under total control, war become routine. 

War has changed, but there's one more thing I must do, One last punishment I must endure.

I have to erase my genes, wipe the MEME from the face of the earth. 

This is my final mission.

Some stories can't be told by words. Some legends are meant to die. Some bloodlines must come to an end.

Sorry we still don't have pictures. Getting the proof album back seems to be a lot like pulling teeth. We're still working on it, though! Promise!"

I really cannot believe I haven't heard of this before. This is positively remarkable for a free piece of software, especially from someone like yahoo, who's long been known for sub-standard software. Think of widgets as extensions for your desktop. 

<img src=""http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c136/Andymion/desktop.jpg"" alt=""my desktop"" />

I have in this screenshot:

-replacement quick launch bar
-folder linked to another directory on another drive for storing things
-winamp remote
-600-mile radar
-dayplanner
-bandwidth monitor
-processor monitor
-RAM monitor
-weather &amp; forecast
-alarm clock (chimes on the hour, too!)


There are thousands of widgets and it's apparently relatively simple to make your own, you only need to know javascript and a little xml. I may give it a shot if there's something else I need, though! lol

I'm pretty sure there's no malware involved here... I sure hope not, anyway. The widgets' footprints don't seem to be of great consequence, either. I can run Guild Wars near flawlessly (which is surprising). My resources really don't seem to suffer at all from this. 


Other than that, it's been pretty slow on the news front, unlike my nose, which has been running like a faucet. Bow Eagle has reached Augury Rock via a super shortcut I found yesterday. The goal for today is to Ascend, if at all possible. 

I'm getting more stressed about fundage for the wedding. We may have to scrap certain ideas just to make this thing go down now. We'll see."

Can't believe how central of a focus this wedding has become for me. It seems like I'm constantly realizing that I need to buy more stuff. Now it comes up that I have to have gifts for the grooms, as well as trinkets and bubbles for people who attend the wedding to pick up and do with as they please. That wouldn't be such a big deal if we didn't still have to pay for our rings and honeymoon (not to mention bills and rent in the meantime). I think Kris said she needed to buy something else for her bridesmaids, too. *sighs* Where the hell's the money going to come from?

Also, traceband.com has expired and it doesn't look like the guys are going to renew it. Fine by me, one less headache to not deal with. Just wish they'd let me know if they even care."

"event","In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down falling down
Falling out to go far from the soul (ah)

2x
In these demon days
It's so cold inside
so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
because mother earth wants us all to leave
when lies become reality
you numb yourself with drugs and t.v.
lift yourself up it's a brand new day
so turn yourself round
don't burn yourself, turn yourself
turn yourself around
into the sun!

to the sun, to the sun...
To the sun, to the sun...

An observation: 

What is the real me? Is it he who goes to the timeclock everyday looking for pay? Is it he who spends time with those close to him? Is it he who is always upset? Is it all of these things? Or none of these things? 

Life was once so simple, I did not even have to worry about who I was... then it was so much easier to be me. At some point I became ashamed of this. Insecurities abound, I trudge on. What is it I am missing? I'm deffinately missing something. Accomplishemnt. Aye, that's what it is. 

I wish I could feel like the 'good guy' again. Not that I feel like a bad guy now... it's just the whole shades of grey thing. I lack ambition. I lack resolve. If I could just get a leg up, I'd be well on my way... but I'm wearing concrete galoshes it seems. 

I must see what the coming months bring. Life will be changing then. Perhaps things won't be so bad, <b>then.</b> Perhaps things will be much worse, <b>then.</b> In any case, I'm glad for a partner for the journey, long or short as it may be.

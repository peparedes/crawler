Emma and I looking quite intelligent indeed. (The mouth thing is an ongoing joke, as you will soon find out.)

Rachel spent most of the time avoiding the camera at all costs. Ohh, Rachel, we love you.

<img src=""http://www.deathofpoetry.net/images/group.jpg"">
Hot. I want to eat Calvin and his cuteness. (As you can see.)

I look atrocious in this picture, but this was our table. Left to right;
Calvin, me, Emma, Rachel, mom & dad, Jamie, Emily, Jeremy

<img src=""http://www.deathofpoetry.net/images/emmamouth.jpg"">
She's going to be a porn star, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF HER MOUTH.

<img src=""http://www.deathofpoetry.net/images/speech1.jpg"">
Me attempting to make jokes in my speech.

<img src=""http://www.deathofpoetry.net/images/speech2.jpg"">
.. and failing horribly :)

<img src=""http://www.deathofpoetry.net/images/emmarachel.jpg"">
Emma & Rachel trying so hard not to embarrass me. They failed at that too. Bastards.

<img src=""http://www.deathofpoetry.net/images/cute.jpg"">
Ignoring me in this picture, WHY IS HE SO SEXY?! If he weren't already mine I'd steal him from me.

Carol, mom, Darlene, Bubie, Annsley. Spot the one who does not belong..

The cake turned out tasting terrible, by the way. That's because Carol made it though.

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/siblings.jpg"">
Me, Jamie and Jeremy with his UGLY HAT which he would not take off. He was so proud of it because it's the only hat he's been able to find in his lifetime that fits his abnormally gigantic head.

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/concentrate.jpg"">
Deanna was examining my Sephora lipgloss, which turned out to be a big hit.

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/strut.jpg"">
My dad just took this picture as Jer & I were leaving Yorkdale because he wanted to demonstrate how trampy I looked.

I thought I looked quite nice thanks.

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/haha.jpg"">
Jamie & Annsley, part I.

Part II.

<lj-cut text=""Engagement party"">

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/engage2.jpg"">
I was the only bridesmaid there, haha. This was Julianne and Sean's engagement party that we had at our house (that's the front hall, where most of the parent fighting takes place muhaha). Julianne is my cousin.

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/engage.jpg"">
Julianne is so pretty :(

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/catcher.jpg"">
Random photo: I AM SO BUTCH! Yessss. I was a damn good catcher, thank you.

Hahaha what a bad picture. That was from that birthday thing where Calvin was undeniably hot playing with small children. (No, he is not actually grabbing my boob in this picture - although it most certainly seems that way, doesn't it.)

Also: I don't know why I look like I'm of Latin descent, either. I'm probably the whitest person there (behind Rachel of course).. but here, I'm BLACK! Woot.

The photographer was obsessive with my horse, when I went to see the pics after he said ""OH MY GOD it's the beautiful grey one that's so photogenic.. oh let me touch him.. oh he's beautiful."" And he was fat, which added to it, you know.

"event","Well, the show went well. I have pictures but they haven't been posted on the photographer's website yet, so I'll get to that later.

Furbie was amazing. The first two days of showing were absolute SHIT though, because the weather was like pouring rain and about 5 degrees C. And Furbie hates the rain/cold/anything less than perfect, because he has abnormally sensitive skin (I can't even wash him in semi cold water, he'll flip out). So depsite the shit conditions, and the soup-like footing in the jumping ring that made me close my eyes and fear for my life everytime I had to go around a corner, I managed to qualify for the regional show on Sunday in all my classes.

Sunday was beautiful and sunny and yay. Furbie likes yay weather. In my hunter hack (judged on the flat and over two fences) class he won Reserve Champion (!!). He had a perfect round, and the judge is the top hunter/jumper judge in North America too, and he loves my horse (always a good sign). I came second to this multi-national champion push button horse, and I was so damn happy because little Furbie has only been jumping for like a year, haha suckers and their non talented horses.

Then in my Junior over fences class he had an amazing round on his second over fences class, and he got called back SECOND (UBER YAY). Which is REALLY amazing because I was competing against these riders who have like $300,000 horses who have their nationally renouned parents training them and they decide which one they want to ride that day depending on the weather or how they feel. I beat the rider who won junior of the year AND his brother who was on the horse of the year (ohh what a burn). But for some reason they don't do Champion or Reserve Champion of that division, you just get Top Five ribbons and you find out what place you got in each class. Which is fine with me, I got a Top Five in junior over fences and he's only been jumping for a year, a year I say!

After my hunter hack class, Alan (my jumping coach who rode the Canadian Equestrian Olympic Showjumping Team and is quite full of himself) came up to me. I had a pretty good idea that it was a good class but everyone was all excited and hadn't said much to me as soon as I left the ring to hear the results. He said, ""Annsley. You just kicked some serious American ass. See those people looking at you? They hate you. Because you just kicked their ass.""

Muhaha. I love being hated :D Actually I feel kind of sorry for the national champion kid that I beat because his mom was yelling at him for not winning. Ah well, such is life."

"event","I'm leaving for the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky tomorrow for that horse show thing. It worries me how I'm not the least bit nervous. My nervous system in general is entirely weird. Whenever I'm about to do something that would cause a normal person to throw up in excitement/nervousness/anxiety, my whole basis of 'feeling' shuts down and I go on a little morphine trip. I suppose that's quite useful, especially when you're going around the ring in front of hundreds of people, but on the other hand I've never gotten to experience the much talked about stage-fright, cold feet, nausea, ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod feeling. I'm guessing that comes from growing up riding and violin competitioning. I like to piss people off when they ask me why I never get nervous by saying, 'nerves are for the weak'. Such a great reaction you get from them, really.

Jesus, and they wonder why I'm so damn competitive. Ever since I've been about 6 years old I've been competing against others, but independently, not on team sports or any of that ""there's no I in team"" crap. I learned at young age it's you and a thousand other people trying to kick your ass to one-up you, so do whatever the hell you can to get on top. At violin competitions it was only myself to rely on and at horse competitions it was lock your stall door and tack truck because someone will go in there and drug your horse and steal your tack.

What a lovely world I grew up in.

But anyways. Kentucky. 14 hour drive with both of my parents in the car. I think I might die. I have to leave at 6 am tomorrow, so I'm thinking if I allow for minimal sleeping time tonight, I should be far too exhausted to fight with them for 14 hours tomorrow (trust me, it's happened). If all else fails I can put some Kahlua in my apple juice. It's genius.. apple and alcohol.. wow. Like that guy who thought up vodka and jello. What a genius.

So I'll see everyone on Wednesday-ish.. I might be back Tuesday, it depends on how everything goes. And my Bubi is in the hospital so I might have to come back sooner than that. Either way, I'll be around sometime next week. Wish me luck :D"

This weekend was the annual AHAEC (Arabian Horse Association of Eastern Canada) Awards Banquet. Basically they tally up the amount of points you won at each show by placing the highest and the most. I won Reserve in Equitation and High Point (BOOYEAH) in Hunter Pleasure Junior to Ride. Which means I owned every single person under 18, no matter what type of horse they had because for some reason in the Junior division they don't split up Half-Arabians and Purebred Arabians. Ohhh man a lot of people were pissed at me, because I didn't just win, I got like 25 more points than the person who won Reserve. I humiliated them. It was an Annsley massacre. BAHAHAHA.

Okay, moving on to pictures. By the way, this is the dress I wore to Semi with Calvin. Probably the best part was that for some really weird reason most people I compete with are shorter than I am. Especially the woman who hands out the awards - she's like friggin 3 feet tall. So in all the pictures I look so tall and yay :D Haha it made my day, shut up.

Alex, Nat, Annsley. I had no idea who these people were but apparently I was on their jumping team, and we won the most jumper points or something, but I had no idea I was on it and it was just funny. I had to go up there for pictures and I'm like ""Why am I here"". Hence why I look so confused.

<img src=""http://deathofpoetry.net/images/annsley/award1.jpg"">
This is when I got the High Point for Hunter Pleasure JTR (Junior to Ride). Only she like threw the whole thing at me (plaque, 40 pound trophy, ribbon and certificate) and I almost fell over it was so heavy.

This is getting the Reserve in Junior Equitation. I was so flustered because they called it immediately after they called the last award that I won, so I had to bolt off the stage and run as fast as I could with a 40 pound trophy entailed, dump it on the table and run back up all composed because the spotlight thingy follows you.

<u><b>Why did the chicken cross the road?</b></u> 

<b>GEORGE W. BUSH</b> 
We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road or not. The chicken is either with us or it is against us. There is no middle ground here. 

<b>TONY BLAIR</b>
I agree with George.

<b>COLIN POWELL</b> 
Now at the left of the screen, you clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. 

<b>HANZ BLIX</b> 
We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed access to the other side of the road. 

<b>SADDAM HUSSEIN</b> 
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in 
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it. 

<b>RALPH NADER</b> 
The chicken's habitat on the original side of the road had been polluted by unchecked industrialist greed. The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels of a gas-guzzling SUV. 

<b>PAT BUCHANAN</b> 
To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American. 

<b>MARTHA STEWART</b> 
No one called to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the farmer's market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information. 

<b>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.</b> 
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question. 

<b>JOHN LENNON</b> 
Imagine all the chickens crossing roads in peace. 

<b>VOLTAIRE</b> 
I may not agree with what the chicken did, but I will defend to the death its right to do it. 

<b>RONALD REAGAN</b> 
What chicken? 

<b>SIGMUND FREUD</b> 
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity. 

<b>BILL CLINTON</b> 
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by chicken? 
Could you define chicken, please? 

<b>MOSES</b>
And then He said ""Let the chicken cross the road.""

<b>DONALD TRUMP</b>
The chicken crossed the road?!?You are FIRED!

<b>Michael Jackson</b>
I didn't do anything with the chicken.I enjoy being with chickens because that makes me feel like a chicken inside.

<b>MORPHEUS</b>
There is no road."

Think another draft isn't going to happen because the Bush administration says so?

Some of you may be familiar with this site: http://thomas.loc.gov/

This is where to go to read about bills currently on the table in Congress.

In the search engine, you can search for the following bills: hr163 & s89

A paraphrase of the bills:
(thank you <lj user=""imbastard"">)
<B>
Mandatory draft for boys and girls (ages 18-26) starting June 15, 2005, is something that everyone should know about. This literally effects everyone since we all have or know children that will have to go if this bill passes.

There is pending legislation in the House and Senate (companion bills: S89 and HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft can begin as early as spring, 2005, just after the 2004 presidential election. This administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while the public's attention is on the elections.

If this bill passes, it will include all men and ALL WOMEN from ages 18 - 26 in a draft for military action. In addition, college will no longer be an option for avoiding the draft and they will be signing an agreement with the Canada which will no longer permit anyone attempting to dodge the draft to stay within it's borders. This bill also includes the extention of military service for all those that are currently active. </b>"

My family really resents me having a social life. I wanted to go to the mall with Emma today, and Matt was going to drive us (and maybe even come). Out of NOWHERE, my mom flips out and says that ""if my father ever found out I was doing this he would disown me"". Honestly, what is so terrible about that?! I feel so caged in here. I can't see the people I want and I can't do simple things like get lunch from a store. I need OUT. I hate how if I ever want to do something, I need to ask permission. For some people, it's so easy. They can just leave the house and visit their neighbor because they're having a basement house party. Nobody cares where they go, who they see, if they go out for a drive with a friend, who they speak to. I feel like I live in a PRISON here.

I think that my mom didn't let me get a ride from Matt because she was afraid that I might actually be having a social life. Whereas before I was a bit of a loner. Now I actually have friends and we do things. It's scaring her. She thinks I'm turning into my brother. Oh, I think I will too."

We've lost our digital camera, by the way. We took it to Alaska and took all of the pictures of glaciers calving and old family relatives I've never met in my life and most of whom we'll never see again. I swear upon my life I was looking through the photos on the camera on the drive home from the airport. And my dad believes he remembered taking it out of his pocket and putting it on the table because it interfered with carrying the luggage. However, it seems to have been missing for a grand total of 3 and a half weeks. We keep saying it'll show up somewhere, and I'm sure it will, but I really do wish it would hurry it's little ass up and do so immediately.

We are preparing for regionals now.. what fun. While at the barn, we decided to put a mirror in front of Newton the goat, and see what happened. What happened was he at first flew backwards, then slowly approached it, and stood staring at himself for about an hour. Then he came up to Sara & I as if to say ""Look guys! I have a new friend!"". Newton is so pathetic, but in an oddly adorable way that only goats can achieve. If you're the last ones at the barn and you, say, drive away, he does his cute little goat canter and baaas while chasing after the car because he can' stand to be left alone. That and we've officially banned newspapers from the barn, because he will madly chase you around and headbutt you until you forfeit it. He enjoys snacking on it. We had to move the bulletin board up 4 feet so that he couldn't put his feet on the wall and pull the paper off of it. Ah, goats."

"event","I've discovered my eyes are actually hazel. Which is.. mind boggling, actually. Stop it, stop rolling your eyes. Because my whole life I've wished I had more interestingly coloured eyes. I think my eye colour is actually changing.. because I've always had really deep brown eyes, but now if you look really closely you can see there's a rim of green around the edge of my pupils, and the brown is considerably lighter. (You can't tell in the new photos; you have to look REALLY closely.) It's kind of strange, really. In light of this incredibly groundbreaking news I've decided that I should keep saying my eyes are brown until there is noticably green edging. But look! Now I have an interesting story to say when people start a conversation about eye colour! Which happens ALL the time, as you know. Instead of the usual, ""oh, my eyes are brown,"" and then the general ignoring of me that follows, I can say ""Well, my eyes may appear to be brown,"" and then I'll lean in, catching everyone's attention and say, ""but really.. they're hazel."" Everyone will gasp in adoration! Because THEY wish they had an exciting story like me! Touching on our last post, I shall flaunt my power! Flaunt!

By the way. Crispers. They are baked, not fried. What the hell does that MEAN? So am I supposed to buy crispers over chips simply because someone decided to stick them in the oven instead of putting them in a frying pan (please ignore the stupidness here)? I'm sure any healthiness produced by putting them in the oven and baking them is going to be reimbursed when they spray them with lysol to get rid of all the bacteria lurking in their kitchens.

Maybe it's a good thing though, because he terrorizes and bullies horses smaller than he is. Hm.

I discovered what my true heritage is yesterday. All this time I thought I was part English, well actually like 1/8 English, because on my mom's side they were Loyalists (in the 1700s). I also thought I was Polish, because my Dad's side came over to Canada in the 1920s, right before the second world war. Lucky, they were. This is still all true, but there's much more to it. I'm not going to go into HOW these people are related to me, because it's going to be too long and complicated. On my mom's side, I think her uncle's dad or something married a woman from France, and he was English. My dad's side was Polish, but one of them was married to a Russian. The name Annsley is a family name that goes back all the way to the 1100s, we have this HUGE book of all the Annsleys ever lived, it's pretty cool. Anyhow, it's an Irish name, apparently.

So, I'm a French Russian English Polish Jewish Canadian with an Irish name. And an Arabian horse.

"event","This weekend I watched a ton of movies. I definitely got my fill of Viggo this weekend. On Friday, I rented both of the Lord of the Rings movies (shut up, I haven't seen them yet). I watched the first one on Friday, and I wasn't completely spellbound by it, but it was alright. Last night I watched the second one, and it was waaaay better. I really liked it. (Especially, you know, Shadowfax. Gorgeous.) So this weekend I'm going to go see the last one. I really wanted to see it in theatres, which is why I rented it now.

I also watched Hidalgo on Saturday night with the Robinsons and my parents. It's a really good movie, not too horse-y, tons of fighting scenes and such. I recommend it. Except in the last bit he frees this horse to run with the wild horses again, and he still has shoes on :P Hahaha. Real clever there, Viggo.

I finally convinced my dad to buy me a new computer! For those of you who are thinking, ""oh, you spoiled kid, you don't NEED a new computer,"" ..to the contrary. My computer is the oldest piece of junk. It randomly shuts down and if I try and run more than two programs at a time (Adobe and Homesite, let's say), it crashes. And if it's not crashing, it's taking an hour to load. At first I thought it was my internet connection, but no, it's because it's so slow that it can't download the objects fast enough. The front half of the computer always falls off, and upon installing Simcity <b>2000</b> (the one made in like '94), it told me <b>I didn't have enough RAM to run it.</b> Half of the recently made games don't work on it, and my video card is a piece of crap so that doesn't let me run practically any new programs. That was one of my key persuasive points when convincing Parent B.

So, for the computer literate out there: Intel Athlon 2.8 GHz (Athlon is my GOD), 160 Gigs, 512 DDR SDRAM, Pentium 4, Plasma screen, DVD burner (two CD-ROM drives), a memory card drive for your digital camera, comes with optics mouse and keyboard and speakers. For .. $899! (Not including the plasma moniter, though.)

"event","I suppose you're all dying to know about the Leaf game on Saturday. The intimate details, anyhow.

Firstly. Great seats. Gold, 15th row in, on an angle from the goalie. I saw everything. It was quite possibly.. the most entertaining Leaf game you could attend (mostly because the extreme pressure to kick ass or lose the cup wasn't involved).

As normal hockey fans would know, we kicked some Ottawa ass. 5-1 baby, that's the way it is. Domi was, as usual, in the penalty box for most of the night, but you have to love that guy, he made the absolute best crosschecking I've ever seen live. He almost broke someone's nose when he slammed their face into the boards. (Mmm. Violence.)

Everytime the captain of the Sens, Alfredsson ,got the puck, everyone booed so loudly you couldn't even hear above the miked ice. This was mostly due to the fact that he was waving his stick in front of Belfour's face for a few seconds to distract him (didn't get called, of course). And, well, he has this disgusting shoulder-length blonde hair, making him very anti-marketable.

But I officially fell deeply in love with our fans during the commercial break. They did one of those ""Kiss Me"" shots on the screen, and the last one they did, guess who showed up.. none other than Trista and Ryan from the Bachelorette. It wasn't taped either, because I looked across from me and I saw them smooching away. Anyhow, instead of the inscessant cheering I expected, everyone started BOOING. Then they left. Toronto is GOD. If you can imagine me any more patriotic at that moment.. well.

About half way through some random guy gave me a yellow lollipop. I ate it. It was good. Looking back it was probably the most retarded thing I could ever do. Very clever Annsley, taking candy from a stranger. But subconciously I think I've always held that rule for the US. Especially not at a Leaf game. It didn't kill me though, and the lollipop was banana. Did you know that yellow ones were banana? I thought they were lemon. *Shrugs* Maybe he spiked it or something.

And Belfour remains number one when one of the players was right in his crease and was practically sticking his ass square in his face. BAM. Took his stick and whacked him so fucking hard on the right leg. He still didn't move so he did it again except the player lifted his leg to avoid the hurting. Ahahahaha what a pussy. Oh and with 0.09 seconds left of the third quarter, Sundin took one of those 'may-as-well-try' shots and it actually went in. Is there any better team than the Leafs? No. Exactly.

To end the game with 27 seconds left, about a minute after he got back on the ice from his last penalty, Domi started a fight which eventually brought in everyone from the team attacking each other, and all the refs were trying to pry him apart from one of the Sens. It took them a damn long time to sort out all the sticks, gloves and helmets that were strewn across the ice. And, in his Domi-like trademark, he ended the game with 7 minutes of penalties <3

You only wish you were Torontonian, foos."

"event","""Annsley, you suck at getting off the phone.""

My mother told me this this morning. This is true, I thought. I also suck at soccer. I play with my head down, looking at the ball the whole time which, as most non-sucking-soccer players will tell you, is a really great way to suck at soccer. Another thing I suck at is buying pants. I'm pretty good with buying shirts but when it comes to pants, I'm slowly discovering that in order to get a good pair you have to try on several different sizes and many different styles, which is another thing I suck at--trying on pants. I also suck at remembering where I put down my pen. I can walk around with a pen chained to my ankle and somehow I'll let it get away.

I suck at remembering names. I've even tried repeating the name in a sentence immediately after meeting them, like ""Hi John. How do you feel about that, John?"". Not 3 minutes later, I'll be staring blankly at John's face thinking that no matter what amount of money John pays me, I will not for the life of me be able to remember his name. I suck at most physical activities. Kickboxing, Judo, Karate, anything with physical exertion involved is basically a guarantee that I suck at it. And in case you might be thinking that this could be offset by some superhuman intellectual prowess.. I suck at geometery, chemistry, biology, molecular studies, the english language, iambic pentameters, all things poetic, masculines and feminines and every now and then I have to stop and ask myself is there one L in family, or two?

I especially suck at Valentine's day. Somehow I manage to mess it up every single year. I suck at the butterfly stroke, which I have spent countless hours trying to do but I'm pretty sure that's something I'll die sucking at. However I am pretty good at the dead man's float, but on the other hand if you suck at that, then you must suck at things even more than I do. I suck at getting up in the morning because I swear, you could dump a bucket of water on my head and I'd still be dreaming about the latest hot guy I saw. I suck at understanding people, and they suck at understanding me, but I also suck at expressing myself as a normal person, which basically covers my entire life story.

I suck at ending things, so I'm just going to end this by saying that I suck at ending things. And I suck at remembering what I've already said, so the fact that I just repeated myself outlines how much I suck at it."

"event","And, as previously anticipated, Gangs of New York was a <b>TERRIBLE</b> movie. To think that all this time I thought Romeo&Juliet (the modernized version) was the worst movie I've ever seen! It will be extremely hard to get any worse than Gangs of New York. Extremely. Leo started out with an okay Irish accent, and then by the end it sounded a lot like he grew up dairy farming in Iowa. He's incapable of portraying any kind of emotion, and when he does, it's the wrong one. I'm inclined to believe he's just a really bad actor, or the director of this movie is a really bad director.

Cameron Diaz should just stick to really chic movies (Charlies Angels, The Mask). It's either that or avoid any supporting roles with Leo. She, much like the rest of the cast, was awful as well. And by the way, she makes a very ugly (curly) redhead.

On the other hand, they might not have been so bad if I had <i>any</i> idea what was going on. I got lost about 15 minutes in, when one of his friends (or at least I thought he was-- later they stabbed each other) tried to explain the 15 details of each different gang residing in New York. Twenty minutes later, after he was finished his huge paragraph, I began to analyze the background scenery when I decided I'd never realize what he was talking about.

Amidst the three hour movie, there were three situations where I began to hope it was almost over. There was absolutely no plot structure involved. There were something like 5 climaxes. Everytime I thought I had a delicate grasp of what was happening, a 'gang' member would stab a member of the same gang with a butcher knife, and then all the buddy-buddy relationships between the characters would get reversed.

I can't even explain to you my confusion. Only at about 4 points in the movie did I think I could understand what was going on (which didn't last very long). Every part of the movie was a BLUR, because NOTHING MADE ANY SENSE. I get so angry talking about it because dammit, I can't believe they could be making that movie and think that it <i>did</i> make sense, or that it would make any profit.

Do not. Rent. This movie. EVER.

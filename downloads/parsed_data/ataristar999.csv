"event","hello all.  Sorry I havent updated in, what was it, like 38743765743 years.  I was...busy!  ::smiles::.  heh.  Soo, not a whole lot has happened to me lately, (but hey, what else is new?), so there won't be a lot to update about.  At least not that I can think of.  So anyways, yesterday was valentines day.  That was pretty fun.  I went to the ""sno-daze"" dance at school with Niki.  We went out to dinner before the dance (to applebees.  Nothing screams romance like ""eating good in the neighborhood"", right?).  It was pretty good.  It wasn't anything to special though. (until we got to the dance). So yeah, we get to the dance and we found courtney, john, carly, cynthia, ryan, steph, ben, leigh, tyler, lauren, and eric.  We were happy bout that.  so yeah...We danced, and thats about it.  Good times though.  the night before that was pretty fun though.  I went sledding at Manitou ridge with Miranda and Niki, then after that, Ana came over and we went to travises house.  It was fun there...we played twister.  HAHAHAHAHA.  Yeah, it was cool, despite it's sound-stupidness.  today was pretty low-key.  I woke up, went to the mall, and then went to Lee's with Natalie, another Natalie, Sammy, and Karl.  We didn't really do much...just hung around in her basement and stuff.  Tomorrow is monday and I don't have school!  ^___^ that [amuses] me.  yeaaaaaaaaah, I dunno.  School is goin pretty good..I had a frickin cold last week though, so i got to stay home on thursday, which was nice, despite the fact that I felt like I was going to die.  I have been keeping up in my classes and stuff. So yeah, it's been going good.  I got a digital camera finally :P, so theres pictures of me on my computer.  which is good.  Anyways, tomorrow is gonna suck.  I have to do homework, and I have to help my mom paint her room.  Woohoo (not).  Anyways, I'll post soon.

P.S. Kim, I posted, Happy? =D

Later, Ryan."

"event","You'll understand my title soon enough.  Anyways, I haven't updated this thing in a looooong time.  Well, A lot has happened to me...I brough home like 16 good papers for my parents so they are pretty happy with me, I hung out with my cousin Kim a few times (Tia and Kelly, Too), Hung out with friend, Gone places. Yea.  Good stuff. So to start off, I will talk about my little perkins...ehh...trip?  So on like...sunday night (the one before MLK jr. day), Kim, Tia, and Kelly slept over.  10 o'clock rolls around and we decide that we're hungry.  So we pack into kims car and go to perkins.  Luckily enough (not), the one we drove to was ""closed for cleaning"". Jerks.  So we drove all the way back from vadnais heights to the one over by maplewood mall.  At least that one was open, but it wasn't a pleasant visit.  lol.  So first, our waitress (nicole) seated us.  She was just insane.  She seriously was on crack or something.  So yeah, as I said, she seated us, asked us for our drink orders then ran...literally RAN from our table.  We were like ""ok, well...whatever"".  So she shows up about a minute and a half later with our drinks, and she goes ""OK!  Are you ready to order yet?"".  And we're all like ""uhhh....We need a few minutes.""  So being the freak she is, she runs away.  And then, a few minutes later she shows up again, asking for our orders.  We decide we're ready.  So she started with me and said ""can I take your order?"", So I said pancakes (mmm), and before I could even get done saying it she looks at Tia and goes ""how about for you?"", And she would just like cut us off right in the middle of what we wanted.  Kind of weird...Anyways, so she gets all our orders then runs into the kitchen.  So we're sitting there for about 25 minutes just talking and waiting for our food.  Finally, she brings it out.  We were all super hungry so we like, shoved it in our face.  as she was giving us our food, a group of 16 teenagers came in, and were conveniently placed right next to us.  Bleeeh.  So we're sitting there eating and the waitress brought out the food for the asian people that were sitting a few rows kiddie-corner from us.  Somehow, the waitress managed to drop a plate of food ALL over the floor.  Shrimp, steak, fries, rice...Everything just went flying. We felt bad, but at the same time we were laughing.  Anyways, Kim looked down at the floor, and then she looked over and goes ""oh my god"".  We were like ""what?!?!""  and she goes ""the lady spilt ketchup all over my pants!""  and sure enough, we look over, and theres a huge ketchup stain alllllll over her leg.  Other than that, we weren't to satisfied with our food either.  my pancakes weren't done or something because I don't think it's normal for pancakes to SLIDE down your throat without even chewing them, Tia's burger looked like it was ripped apart then put back together again on a bun, Kelly's quesadillas had green things in them that looked like snot, and Kim's sour cream was like...moldy.  So the waitress runs up to us and asks us if we need anything.  She didn't give me syrup or butter so I asked for those...She came back with them, and asked Tia if she wanted mustard for her burger.  Tia said no, so the waitress started running away, then saw a bottle of mustard on a table, and she turns around and goes ""Hey, heres your mus-SHIT!"" and books it into the kitchen.  Me and Kim looked at each other and go ""did she just say shit"" and started laughing uncontrollably.  After that, she brought us our check, so we paid and LEFT.

The next day, Tia and Kelly left at like 9 in the morning to go help Tia's mom do something, but kim stayed.  That day, we ended up going to the mall of America.  That was pretty fun.  I got pants and sandals from hollister.  I really like that store.  and yea, my sister and mom came with us to the mall.  It's always fun hanging out with my sister. and yeah, not to much happened after that.  I had drum lessons that night.  But yeah, nothing big.  

Today (january 23rd), its a friday and we dont have school!!  So today at 3:30 Cynthia and Carly are coming over so we can have band practice.  We're doing battle of the bands in a few months.  I'm already nervous, but hey...It'll be fun.  so yeah, thats my eventful past few weeks.  Oh yeah, Mr. (the cat) stayed with us for like 2 weeks.  That was fun.  anyways, that's all I have to say for now.  I'll update on sunday about this weekend.  Later."

"event","helloooo.  Today is the FIRST DAY OF 2004!!!  Hell yea!  but anyways, last night was reaaaaly fucking fun.  it started off not so great because my mom was being a huge bitch, but after i got to emilys it was fun.  Steph, kelly, emily, and shawn were all there.  But then there were fucking like 498549875 little kids running around all over the god damn place.  And the parents, of course were drunk as hell so them taking care of their children wasnt much of a priority to them at the time.  So we made them all go outside into the backyard for a while, then they all came in (there were about 16), and we gave them toys and we didnt have to worry about them again.  but anyways, so yeah, we were all hanging out in the basement the whole time, playing air hockey, playstation 2, internet, stuff like that.  it was pretty fun.  Then midnight rolls around, and that was pretty cool because we were watching the T.V. and the we were counting down, and the ball dropped and stuff.  it was super fun.  then someone lit of like 6 rows of god damn firecrackers at once...scared the hell out of all of us.  But yeah...

So after that, We went back to emilys house and started to watch pirates of the carribean.  About halfway through though, steph wanted her belly button pierced.  So, me and Emily, being the nice friends we are, decided to do it for her =D.  So we sterilized the needle and all that shit, and Emily held stephs hand while I did it.  but yea, We were using a hooke 14 gauge needle and I got the needle almost all the way through, like you could see the sharp end coming out the bottom, and the needle would not move for shit.  So I sat there for like 20 minutes trying as hard as I could to push the needle through.  Unfortunately that didn't work.  So me and Emily switched places for a while to she if she could finish it.  that didnt work either.  So after about 15 minutes of Emily trying she couldn't get it either.  Steph started getting anxious and wanted to do it herself.  So she tried, unsuccessfully too.  so yeah.  moral of the story---We gave up.  Then after that, we finished watching pirates of the carribean, and started watching this movie called interstae 66.  It was very...might we say...interesting?  but yeah.  And Emily has THE shittiest computer that me and steph had ever seen so we attempted as best we could to fix it.  No luck.  It was really just a night of failures.  All in good fun though, by god.  but yeah, so we didnt end up going to sleep until about 5:45 this morning, and woke up at about noon.  And yeah, i brought a backpack to the part because i knew i would be sleeping over, and i was going to keep it in my van until my parents left (they had another party to go to), it had clothes and stuff in it for me to sleep in. But no, they left.  without telling me. So I had to sleep in my god damn green and black ""bondage"" (thats what they're called) pants.  no fun.  and yeah.  But anyways, that is all I have to post for now.  HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE."

"event","WEllllll....Last night was super fun.  I went to my cousin Kims house to sleep over, and we were getting bored sitting at her house so we called tia to see what she was doing and we ended up hanging out with her.  We were driving around and some kids in a car in front of us were trying to start shit with us, so they slammed on their brakes when we were goin down the highway, so (kim was driving), took a fricking sharp turn right and we bolted down the road cuz we saw the kids in the other car start to turn around.  after that, we went to pick up kims other cousin to hang out with us who lived in blaine, Brian.  We werre trying to track down Jason, but we had no luck with that whatsoever, we drove out to his house all the way out in fridley, and he ended up not being there.  oh well.  So after that we decided to go eat at perkins.  it was fun, and there was this HUGE mob of foreign people at the table like...right next to us, and they had REALLY heavy accents and it was weird because all at the same time they would look at us.  Sort of creepy really.  We think they were making fun of us in their language, but whatever.  But this one guy on the end kept looking over at us (by himself, by god), and he was staring at Tia, and so were like ""shit tia, do something"" so shes like ""aright tell me when he looks over"" and so I started watching him out of the corner of my eye and he finally lookd so i elbowed told Tia he was looking and she looked at him, smiled, and did this eyebrow raising thing (like...flirting), and he was like...In aww of himself.  It was funny, but scary becaus after that he like literally would not stop looking at us.  ick.  After our little ""experience"" there we decided to take brian home and go to wal-mart.  this was at about midnight.  So went in there and were getting our stuff...I had a dollar mind you =D...And yeah.  nothing too exciting happened there, except kim knocked over a display of chap-stick.  lol.  And yea, so after that Tia brought us back to our house and we watched jackass the movie and freaky driday.  They were both good =D.

So yeah, today is new years eve, and in about 2 and a half hours we're going to go to some party thing at emilys.  it should be fun.  steph will be there, and hopefully kelly will be too.  But yea, so anyways...Thats all im going to post for now.  Later, and happy new years."

"event","Well, today was officially the lamest day of my whole break.  I did not leave my house once.  I didn't even change out of my pajamas for god's sake.  so I woke up at 12:15, played the sims for like 2 hours, then my mom called and said she was coming home...grrr!  I thought that today I would finally get to be home alone for a while, but NO, my mom came home at like 2:15.  oh well, tomorrow is coming.  =D I get to hang out with Kim!  (my favorite cousin in minnesota), and were going around to piercing and tatto parlorsa to see where she can get the web of her tongue pierced.  (the web is that thing under your tongue thats like..uh..a web of skin?  as gross as that sounds.) But it does look pretty cool.  So yeah, thats my day tomorrow.  Hmm, 2004 comes in like...3 days.  EXCITEMENT!  oh, just an update on my ears...they still hurt.  No worries though.  So anyways, Im sitting in here right now listening to my parents as they comment on fear factor.  It's quite funny really. ::shifty eyes:: there is nothing to say.  Amanda called me today twice from alyssas.  Shes calling me from siouxsannes later tonight.  Ugh.  What a lameass day.   Tonight i plan to play the sims some more, then go online and talk to people, then read, then watch a movie and wait for 10 in the morning to roll around when kim calls me.

"event","read my cousins post that was at my dumb grandmas with me on christmas eve:

Well, for christmas eve we went to my grandma blacks house, which is usually torture (sp?) but i guess it wasnt all that bad. First we started to watch the christmas story, like we always do, thats just a tradition for us, i guess its the most entertaining thing over there these days besides my grandpa art not being able to hear and listeing to him tell us that we either need to do something for him or listen to him critisize someone, lol. My sister got sick while we were openening gifts and yeah...my cousin got a signed record from Blink 182, my cousin billy met them and then they did that shit. MOTHA FUCKA...jk. I got a wallet from my cousin holly and then from my aunt i got a scarf, a shirt, and a cute purse type thingy. We ate pie and it was alright. 

We didnt end up going to church that night because my dad was drinking and yeah, if we woulda done that...haha he woulda been snoring right through that one. lol. So, we just came back and opened gifts. I got a 20"" TV, one with a flat screen, a DVD/VCR, tons of sweatshirts, purses, movies, hair stuff, and a blinking cell cover. I think i made out pretty well..but yeah..then my sister got jealous and had a bitchy ass attitude and acutally still has it. lol sucks for her. BITCH. anyway...everyone liked their gifts from me, well at least they played like they did. lol. I tried to set up my TV that night but haha, that didnt exactly work. 

On Christmas morning we went to 9am mass. I guess it wasnt to bad, there were tons of people but, i just expected more. Then we went to IHOP for breakfast and that was good. My aunt Jodi was our waitress, which was kinda weird, but whatev. Then we went home and got ready to go to my grandma britz's. We got there and yah basically just sat around and then me and my cousin had to go to my house and get some gifts for my cousins which we forgot. Then we got back and we ate lunch/dinner and it was gooooood. Then we opened gifts, my little cousins got most of them like usual but, yah i got some pretty rad gifts i guess. I got a pink dickies purse and a changing waterfall type thingy and money and yah, i cant remember anything else. 
After my grandmas house nate, heather and i all went to get a bottle of captain from my uncles house but he didnt have any so we just got vodka, and we went to nates house,and just drank. Nate was more high than anything and then Heather, she was just sitting on the phone the whole time.So i drank. I was pretty buzzed, and we went in the hot tub and then nates friend came and brought me and heather home.---> Fun night.Hah. 

Today, i woke up and went to target with my mom and we just looked at the good sales, i didnt get anything. But yah, then came home i made breakfast and then i cleaned my room. It took me like 3 hours to do it. I put my new shit in,My TV, VCR/DVD and yeah...just cleaned and stored some shit. Then i took a shower and got ready. Then tia called and wanted me to go to the holidazzle with her and her mom and go out to dinner. We went to some pub downtown and then watched the parade and then had caribou and mini doughnuts, and walked around. We left and went and saw cheaper by the dozen. It was a verry good. movie! And now i'm here. And, paul called me, haha, thats funny, Welp not callin him back, i'm goin to bed. .:LaTeR:.

Shes the best cousin ever.

Oh, by the way, in my post below i didnt go to the st. croiz, i went to the st. croix. I swear I can spell."

^Good stuff this year..But anyways.  So christmas eve sucked.  I got a total of 3 hours of sleep so I was crabby as all heck, then to top it off we went to my grandmas house.  Shes a good lady, but her and her husband smoke frickin 4375784 packs a day...So you leave the house literally REAKING of smoke.  its disgusting.  then I misplaced my cousins present and it wasnt at my grandmas house so we had to drive ome and get it.  Yeah.  Not such a great day.  Then we went to church at 9:00, not our usual midnight mass thing.  That made me mad too.  Annnnnd lets see.  Thats all that happened that day.  But then christmas day came and that was fun.  We were home for a while, but then at 3 we went to my aunt jaci's new mansion.  yes, mansion.  It was so nice.  Then me and my sister were really wanting to leave because all of my cousins are sorta self-centered and they left to go downtown minneapolis, but didnt invit me or my sister.  we were the only ones left.  Aren't they nice?  But other then that it was good.  Then my parents sat down and played silent night on their guitar and violin for my actual nice grandma.  and today not a whole lot happened.  I went to the st. Croiz river with my dad and went on a walk with him.  It was pretty cool.  then I came home and sat online.  Exciting day!  only not.  But anyways, thats all I have to say for now.

"event","Well, Im just.  Nothing to important happened to me today, really...  I had MATH after school...WOOHOO!  only not really...More like WOO-::falls asleep::.  Anyways, Tonight is lame as all hell.  my parents are gone, and when they come home they expect all my homework to be done...::evil grin::.  So yeah, school was good for the most part.  I get to sit next to Lana in science now so thats good...But yes.  Im hungry.  Ohhh lord i want gardetto's NOW!  NOW I SAY!  hmmm...I need plans this weekend.  But I might go to see screming monkey boner with Laura on saturday at the garage.  I hope I go.  Am I a loser because I think neopets are fun?  Thought so..  Oh yes!  I have school tomorrow!  And monday!  And tuesday!  But not wednesday!  Or thursday!  Or friday!  WOOOOOHOOOOO!  Hey look at this ghetto song that I found about a milkshake...Go on read!  you know you wanna..

""My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard, and they're like 'It's better than your's', Damn right, It's better than your's, I could teach you but I have to charge.""

Amusing, huh?  What does she want to teach me?  I really don't understand. ::sigh:: oh well.  Hmm well I think Im done writing for today, but some more actual GOOD music lyrics for your enjoyment.  Enjoy (hahaha)

""go away leave me alone
I feel your presence in my mind
the time seems to stop I set you free
you calm my mind you calm my mind
make my dreams come true - baby
every time it seems to me
that fiction and reality melt together for eternity
liquid words dropping down the stairs
filling the emptiness with sense
you and me on the floor floating on our sensibility

you need a timekiller and you don't understand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand
I am your timekiller I let your mind expand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand

tick tock tick tock madness comes tonight
what's reality compared to me
I rest on the bed  and I'm sure I slowly get mad
I'm in a state of mind which makes me blind
for the fact that I'm a man
I'm here to stay forever  but not today

you need a timekiller and you don't understand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand
I am your timekiller I let your mind expand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand

in my heart is no place for you
and in my mind is no space for you
the exit already melted away
and now there's nothing left to say

you need a timekiller and you don't understand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand
I am your timekiller I let your mind expand
I am like quicksand lick it from my hand""

"event","Well hello everyone.  Please forgive my not-updating-this-journal time period that I had.  Hmph I feel so...creative!  I just got out of the shower - I dyed my bangs bright red - and I tried to learn japanese today.  It's 10:30 right now (At night) and the only person im talking to is Adam.  He's a cool kid. Anyways, School tomorrow.  Not bummed but not excited.  Damnit, Adam just left.  Oh well, I've got to get to bed soon anyways.  hmmm, I was supposed to see school of rock tonight.  But of course, that didn't work.  Tomorrow maybe though.  I went go-carting on sunday.  It was SO damn fun.  the things went 40 miles an hour ^_~  but yea.  Let's see...FULL HOUSE IS ON EVERY NIGHT NOW!  HELL YEAH!  sorry, good show that is.  ugh I think I'm gonna go.  Tired...as...hell.  And I have some..Issues..to sort out tomorrow with some people.  I'll write tomorrow--I promise myself ^^.   Later.

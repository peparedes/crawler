Sometime in the next 18-22 weeks we'll have a new baby girl arriving and even though I'm SUPER excited, I think ever day with just be and the boys will feel special. 

I AM bored out of my mind though. I think I SHOULD be catching up on laundry. hehe The boys are waking up and they will occupy me for a while before I get to my cleaning...."

So if anyone wants to take put in their bets on what flavor I'm having, they can :o)
I have two little boys already, so some say that guarantees having another. Chinese charts say it's a girl (if I believed that stuff). My intuition says girl, but who says my intuition is right anyways. (it WAS right with the first two though)

So...what does everyone else think? Boy or girl? You have 2 days to vote and then I'm posting the results.

ALTHOUGH, you might want to vote if you think baby will have it's legs crossed, because that happens often and I very well won't know the sex of baby for that reason. Wish me luck on Wednesday! :o)"

"event","I always wondered what Elijah thought about his Papa being at work all day. I wondered where he thought his Papa was this whole time. Even though he has been told on many occasions that Papa is at this unknown place called ""work,"" Elijah has come up with two places HE thinks Papa is at or doing.

#1 ""Papa's sleeping."" He insists his Papa is just sleeping. Forget the fact that he can't find him in the bed. He's STILL ""sleeping.""

#2 ""Papa's in tafoon."" Papa's in the bathroom. Umm...ok. An 8 hour bathroom trip sounds unlikely, but Elijah sometimes insists Papa's just in the bathroom for a REALLY long time. hehe

It's fun to learn what goes on in my little one's head. We are starting to be a lot more careful with what video games Elijah watches us play now. He's getting old enough to start to understand it. Though I'm still not TOO worried yet, considering the other night he informed us that all those people were ""falling down."" We were watching S.W.A.T. Not very gory, just lots of guys ""falling down."" Everytime one got shot, Elijah would exclaim ""Oh no...he fell down."" hehe He thought it was funny. Still...I'm g oing to try to limit his intake of watching bad guys fall down :o)"

"event","Potty training issues:

I have a potty training question for anyone who wants to comment. Do you think it's a BAD idea to punish (lightly) when a almost 3 year old wets his uns. Elijah doesn't seem to notice or care when he wets in them and he has NO desire to tell me when he goes. If I time it right he'll stay dry almost all day, but it's up to me to time it right and predict when he'll need to go. He has been pooping and peeing in his uns when I don't get him there on time. SO, should I express to him that he does NOT get candy when he's wet(He gets an m&m when he's dry and goes on the pot)? Or maybe even give him a light swat? Or timeout? Or SOMETHING? I want him to feel negative about soiling himself and POSITIVE about staying dry. I know a lot of kids already feel negative about wetting in their uns, but not him. So...there's my delima...."

Things have calmed down for us now. I'm slowly unpacking and getting on with life. I quit my job when I was so sick and I don't plan on going back. 

Morning sickness has been gone for several weeks as planned :o) Today I went to the doctor and got to hear a nice heartbeat. Baby's heartbeat was going 148 beats a minute. Fast little heart. I love it. My next appointment is February 12th and I have an ultrasound later that day also. I'm excited about the ultrasound. I'm very anxious to see if this will be boy #3 for us or girl #1 :o) I have about..4 weeks to wait. It's strange looking at ultrasound pictures and realizing that there is this little being with arms and legs and a heartbeat, yet I'm hardly showing at all. In the next 4 weeks I except some serious changes in my belly though. Fun stuff :o)

My good friend has been encouraging me and HER friends have sent me some cool poems. This is one. Not sure if the friend wrote it herself, but I like it...



Some houses try to hide the fact That children shelter there.
 
Ours boasts of it quite openly The signs are everywhere.

For smears are on the windows, Little smudges on the doors; 

I should apologize I guess For the toys strewn on the floor. 

But I sat down with my children And we played and laughed and read.
 
And if the doorbell or the phone don't shine Their eyes will shine instead. 

For when at times I'm forced to choose The one job or the other, 

I want to be a housewife -- BUT FIRST I'LL BE A MOTHER."

Mother, oh mother, come shake out your cloth!
Empty the dustpan, poison the moth,
Hang out the washing and butter the bread,
Sew on a button and make up a bed.
Where is the mother whose house is so shocking?
She's up in the nursery, blissfully rocking!

Oh, I've grown as shiftless as Little Boy Blue
(Lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).
Dishes are waiting and bills are past due
(Pat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo).
The shopping's not done and there's nothing for stew
And out in the yard there's a hullabaloo
But I'm playing Kanga and this is my Roo.
Look! Aren't her eyes the most wonderful hue?
(Lullaby, rockaby, lullaby loo).

Oh, cleaning and scrubbing will wait till tomorrow,
But children grow up, as I've learned to my sorrow.
So quiet down, cobwebs. Dust, go to sleep.
I'm rocking my baby. Babies don't keep.

I'll never get over the excitement of being pregnant and seeing the baby on screen for the first time. Even though it's baby #3, it feels new all over again. Dan and I enjoyed seeing the baby today. So in 10 more weeks I'll be able to find out if it's a boy or girl hopefully. THAT I'm excited about. Despite what everyone probably thinks, I'd be VERY happy with a boy. I'm used to boys. I love boys. I have lots of boy clothes ;o) BUT, I'm also thinking it is a girl, or at least wishing secretly. It'd be a total change of pace around here to have a girl. hehe Anyways, 3 weeks until morning sickness ends I hope. That's yet another thing to be excited about. :o) Yay for babies....."

We'll be able to pay off our van in the next 11 months and then all we'll have left is school to work on for a few years after that. Things are looking up :o) Thank God.

Twenty Two just doesn't seem like an important number. Anyways, it makes me feel like I'm getting so grown up. I'm getting old ;o) We'll probably stay home and watch some TV and relax.

In the last week my boys have been slowly working up to going to bed an hour late (10 o' clock) waking up an hour later (9ish) and napping way later (1:30-4:00). I really would prefer everything to be back an hour (well maybe not their wake time in the morning hehe). So I was just getting a game plan to fix this little error in our schedule and then I realized...Daylight Saving Time!!!! The last Sunday of October, if I'm not mistaken, we will be falling back on hour. So it's perfect. I will only have to do two things. Endure them going to sleep so late for one more week (no big deal) and be sure to put a reminder on the computer to set back the clocks. Then magically they'll be going to sleep at 9 again.

My birthday is in a week and a half and I have a feeling that I will not be meeting my large goal of losing 20 pounds in 7 weeks. But I have lost 15 so far and gone down about a size and a half. So I think that's pretty good :o)

I'm wanting to start over with dieting, but I also want to start over with flylady. I miss the way my place was spotless when I did the flylady method. I miss how decluttered it was and how easy it was to keep it clean. I had nesting on my side, and after having Micah I haven't been able to get that drive for cleaning back. But it's time to try again. So here we go.

I've been making up my Christmas Wish List lately. It's lots of fun. I'm SO looking forward to the holidays. Things will be a little crazy with moving and potential company, but it'll be fun. We bought the boys their Halloween outfits. We really didn't have much of a choice all the outfits in their sizes were sold out at Wal-Mart, Fred Meyers and several other places. SO, as a last resort we went to Old Navy where there were two froggies left in just their sizes. SO, we have 2 frogs for the harvest festival at church this year :o) They look SO cute. After Halloween we are going to let them wear the outfits as PJ's for winter because they are so warm.So, after Halloween there is Thanksgiving, and then Christmas :o) I love the holidays"

They napped all the way there. It's amazing how smooth and quiet our van is. I'm loving it. So we shopped around at the outlet malls for a while. I drooled over the toddler Bibles and wanted to buy one for Elijah. I decided to wait until he's a tad older. I bought some new jeans with my baby-sitting money. They are too small still, BUT they ALMOST fit. I was so excited, that I just bought them. They are a new kind of Old Navy jeans. Instead of flare of bootleg (I love both of those too), it's  new relaxed kind, but still low rise. I really like them. They are going to help motivate me to just slim down a little more (preferably a LOT more ;o).  We got some food and said a quick hi to the ocean :o)

THEN off home, but on the way home we decided, hey why not go to Portland? So when it was getting dark out we started our trip to Portland. The boys were in their PJ's and all ready for sleep. The problem is is that Micah was getting sick. He was coughing and sniffling and was not feeling well. So he got cranky. 

We decided to try to find Krispy Kreme Doughnuts. Sooo...we drove around Tigard...Nope not there. So then I think we drove around Portland. Nope not there....We tried Vancouver, but the kids got fussy at that point and we gave up. I focused on getting them to sleep for a while. Micah and Elijah fell asleep about the time we got to Clackamas. We stopped at a Walgreens and Dan asked someone where the heck Krispy Kreme Doughuts were. AHHH HA! Only 2 miles away. YAY! So we got to experience the famous doughnuts. I went off the diet for the night and had my taste of sugar for the month. Oh baby were they good. We had a nice drive home and got back around midnight :o)"

We really didn't do much this last weekend at all. Dan and Elijah went to church on Sunday. It's always fun when I can send those two off for some father and son bonding. I got to stay at home with my poor Micah. He had a high fever for a few days. The eye teeth are coming in, and that's not fun for him. 
When Dan got home from church I put the boys down and sent Dan over to my brother's house to help him for a while. Micah napped a LONG time, and eventually I had to wake him. He was so hot. So once again I doubled him up on medicine. The neighbor lady decided to take Micah and baby him for me. I thought that was nice. She gave him a bath and all that while I played with Elijah outside. So the day went on like that, and there went the weekend. 

Nothing much happened today. Laundry was done, and toys were picked up. I decided to stay away from the computer when the boys were napping, and their naps seemed to last a LOT longer that way. Three hours of peace. :o) Now everyone is up, Dan is home, and soon we'll be going to our friend Leif's house for dinner. I was hoping to find out today if we are going to get some food money from the manager. She said she'd call today, but oh well. We'll see. Our costco trip on Saturday will last us a while. 
Well, that's it for now. I'm obsessed with New Zealand pictures right now and I think I'll be trying to put some on here soon. Sooooo pretty."

SO, half our freezer stuff is with the neighbor, and the other half is in a cooler with 3 bags of ice. All our fridge stuff is bad and useless. I dare not open the fridge to throw the stuff away. I don't want to smell that smell ever again.

SO, for the next 2 days I'm going to be bugging my neighbors constantly to borrow a glass of milk, or to get more ice that I've put in their freezer. I don't know what else to do, and I have no idea how to cook without refrigerated or freeze...erated food. What to do...what to do..."

"event","Today has been emotional. I managed to get a dentist appointment and get there. I had to get a baby-sitter first for Micah and for baby Sebastian (with Rene's permission of course). My sister in law is a complete lifesaver. She even washed my dishes! 

So, I managed to get to the dentist office just in time. Elijah had a blast...at first. He enjoyed the attention and didn't even mind when they looked at his tooth. He even sat real still and bit down on this plastic thing for the x-ray. That's when they said..something. I'm still not sure what. A bunch of medical mumbo jumbo. All I know is that the nerve was very exposed and they were very shocked that he hasn't been crying a lot, because he must have been in pain this whole time. I'm SO glad I ended up taking him. The dentist said that if we would have waited much longer the tooth would have abscessed and it would have been much worse. Because of that and all the other stuff the dentist explained to me, they decided to pull the tooth. They didn't want to wait even a day so....guess what? I got the experience something even worse than seeing Elijah fall that day. I had to lay him down on the chair, and wrap him in this Velcro papoose thing. He looked like a little caterpillar. He was laughing and having so much fun until the needle. *sigh* I held his one hand that broke free, but I wanted to cry and might have a bit when they put the needle in his gum, and then again in the rotten tooth. He was screaming and tears were running down his face. I couldn't do anything to make him feel better. Then of course they had to pull and pull until the tooth came out eventually. I guess it was shoved up in his gum a bit from the fall. :o(  It was so hard watching him screaming and watching him bleed. It was so hard :o( They filled the empty hole with gauze and they let him go so I could hold him. He cried in my arms for about 2 minutes while I held the gauze to his tooth. Everyone was cheering him on for doing such a good job. Then he looked up, smiled with his hill Billy smile, and said, ""Yay ged dob!"" (Translation, yay good job) MY sweet boy was proud of himself! :o)  And so was I. 

So he is sound asleep in bed, most likely drooling from the novacane I'm trying to cope with the morning and the idea of him being without a front tooth for the next 4 years. So much for his winning smile :o) He's still my sweet little boy, tooth or no tooth.

Maybe tomorrow will be a better day. There's always tomorrow."

"event","Well I thought it was about time to post. It's been forever. First Dan's parents were here and then Don for a few weeks. I have a problem with posting. Either I have too little to say, or I have too much to write about. Today I have the perfect amount. 

My son, Elijah, looks like someone beat him up. It's very sad. It all started Thursday when we were outside. He started screaming and before I knew if he had a slit under his eye and a big ugly bump above it. As he cried the tears ran into the cut making it hurt worse. He was more upset than I have ever seen him over an injury. He could barely breathe. Of course after I calmed him down I noticed the metal pole of some sort in the hand of the neighbor kid. He's just a baby still, barely 2. So I'm assuming it was him who injured Eli with the pole and it was an accident. These things happen.

So that was Thursday. Then last night he by far achieved his worse injury total. It was terrible. I was outside with him right before bedtime. Trying to get out those last burst of energy before bed. He was talking to Micah so sweetly, asking if Micah was ok. ""You K gaca? You k?"" Micah had taken a little tumble, but was fine. Then Elijah got the bright idea to stand up on the little car thing he was sitting on. It happened so fast. He stood and fell, that quickly. I had no chance to stop him, but I still feel terrible. The toy went backward and he went forward falling flat on his face, with his body flying forward still. He screamed so loud and I felt something only a parent can feel. I would do anything to prevent him getting hurt like like. I felt instantly sick to my tummy and I just wanted him to be ok. His mouth was bloody and his lip was fatter than I thought possible. As we were putting ice on it something fell out. A TOOTH! No wait..only part of it. His teeth were all wiggly and it was hard to tell what was going on in his mouth. Eventually things calmed down after a call to the advice nurse and Elijah fell asleep on the couch with us while watching Daredevil. Now in the morning his right tooth is blackish and split in two, a piece in the front and back. It's terrible. His lip is much better though. But with his eye, and scrapes on his chin and lip...it's not pretty. We are making a trip to the dentest soon to take care of it..somehow. So that's my story. How my poor son got hurt. *sigh*"

I'm excited for micah's birthday, even though we can't seem to find anyone who can show up on a Tuesday evening. We were originally thinking of having a party at Bush Park, but since it'll just be my family, I guess we'll BBQ at Will and Kat's. 

Elijah is in timeout currently and not happy about it. I guess that's the point of time out. If he was happy about it, that wouldn't be very effective :o)

Had a nice evening. Long, but nice. Dan and I splurged at Burger King. I still feel guilty, but mmm...King sized meals and everything! hehe When we pulled up, Mat was pulling up too. We all hung out for a bit until his girly-friend came over. I took off with her so we could go to Winco, and also for a little girl talk :o) I don't get that much and it was really nice. I also got some cookie dough ice cream. Oh baby. Dan and Mat played on his guitar for the longest time. We all ended up staying up until 1:30. That's when I put the broom by the door. That's my little hint for people to leave. It's funny inside joke now. 

Dan's been working with my brother again today. I'm hoping he comes home soon. It's our weekend. (sigh)"

"event","Boy, I've been thinking about life a lot lately. I'm trying not to take anything for granted that I normally do. So many people I know have lost a loved one recently. I myself lost my grandmother a few months back. Then there was my neighbor's baby boy. Several people and children in Mexico that I'll never see again. Then there are the people around me that are suddenly changing in my eyes. I no longer look at them the same. The girl I work with is definitely unsaved and most likely doesn't a clue what she's missing. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't one Christian working where I work. Then our good friend Leif. He's a wonderful person. He's got a great heart, but..he has something missing. The Lord. It's so obvious to me. What is something happened and he died? This great person would be lost forever. Sometimes, I just get more preoccupied from that point on. My neighbors, people at the story, and all these nice people I talk to from day to day..I guess I just realize how sacred life is. How wonderful salvation is, and I want that for everyone. I wonder if any of this even makes sense. Oh well. It's a journal. They aren't supposed to make sense :o)

We are slowly catching up on sleep. Oh, and I hope Dan feels better today. This bug hit him harder than everyone else. Anyways, I better get a shower in before the boys wake up."

But I always check on the boys before bed. Tonight I walked in and noticed 3 things. #1 MY kids refuse to stay sleeping the same direction I lay them down in. #2 if was very cold in there. I took the fan out of the window and closed it. I guess it's colder out tonight than last night. #3 As the air stopped moving I noticed a familiar smell. Poop? Nooo... Could it be? The same smell as last night? I check Elijah and he's sound asleep in his superman PJ's, and no throw up in site. Sure enough my poor baby boy Micah decided to have his turn tonight. What is it with my boys? I don't mind that they threw up. It happens. The whole neighborhood (if that's what you call it) has had some sort of tummy bug and fever. But why can't they wake up? Call out for their parents. My poor sweet boy threw up in his bed and I wasn't there to comfort him and clean him up. He just fell back to sleep in it. It's so sad. I feel so bad. Well, he's cleaned up now, and since I only have 2 kids at the moment, I hopefully won't be smelling that smell again for a long while.

I went by my work, picked up my check, and saw the cool decorations for the graduation party there tonight. I just hope they don't trash my room. I hear they did that last time. It'll be a bingo room for them. woohoo..I guess. Oh! I almost forgot, we went swimming. The water was SO nice.

"event","There's warm air blowing on my from outside. I love the smell of freshly cut grass. mmmmmm :o) Last night was a long night. I had a good evening at work, but I was so worried about my babies. Micah had a fever all day, and on such a hot day. He slept most of the day on and off and I feared he wouldn't sleep a wink last night, but he did. Slept in actually. Leif came over last night and talked a lot. He originally wanted to do a Bible study, but we have never done one and he's a bit afraid to commit to a set time or day or even commit to opening his Bible. Finally we managed to get onto the subject and stay on the subject. He has ADD and he wanders a lot. He gets on rabbit trails like I do :o) Leif talks a LOT about how he really wants to be a good person, and how he feels happy when he does the God thing and goes to church. I wondered if he really understood the concept of Christianity, but then Dan came in an explained everything just the way Leif needed. Leif doesn't believe in Jesus or the Trinity in general and that makes it hard for him to understand a lot of this. Then there are those tricky questions like who created God? Dan explained so much about time, and when time began and all of that. He showed how you can have 3 things be one. Just like an egg is an egg, even though there is a yoke, a white, and a shell. It was really cool. I couldn't repeat how he explained it. Either way it helped Leif a lot, even though the whole subject was giving him a headache. Dan showed him the first part of Genesis and then the first verse in John. Old testament and new. Exactly the same. In the beginning was the word and the Word WITH God and the Word WAS God. Anyways, I'm hoping that all of that sunk in a bit. He's really scared of committing to anything. So we'll see. He ""feels good"" when at church though. So he really wants to come Sunday. 

So after Leif finally left, I checked in on Elijah. Found him sound asleep in a bed that had throw up all over it. He was sick..bad. He threw up and didn't even wake up. Dan gave him a bath while I cleaned up. He was so limp and upset. My poor boys. They both slept in though. I've been treasuring them so much the last day or so. How precious life is that God gives. 

That's about it.  Hopefully I'll get to BBQ tonight :o)"

We were all talking about how Micah refused to walk, even though he's 11 months old and getting close to one. He's just a big chicken :o) Anyways, Kathy's friend Donna was saying how she learned to walk. Her mom would give her a ruler or a pencil and let her hold it and she'd start walking. Donna was claiming it was a balance thing. I guess if she ever took the pencil, then she'd fall right over. Funny huh? She also said that that's how she got her son to walk. He carried that dull pencil around until he was a toddler. hehe So I thought that was funny, but I forgot about the story until just a little bit ago.

So I was helping Micah practice walking. I had my pointing finger in his left hand and he was walking in front of me wherever he wanted to go. I decided just for fun to pick up this pen and exchange it for my finger. Sure enough he didn't notice, AND....he just took off walking!!!! 4 steps at least before he realized I wasn't there. hehe I've done it a few time since. He's out of the walking mood now, but I'm anxious to try again. Funny huh? That's all :o)

It only occurred to me now that he hasn't had a bottle in a long time. Now I have to switch him to milk soon. Then yesterday on his prime teething day, I lost his paci. We have like 6, but I couldn't find one. I'm sure several are in the van. Either way I didn't know what to do. He is so cranky because of his poor gums. Either way I decided just to cross my fingers and I put him down without one. Sure enough he fell asleep just fine without it. Then again last night and now for his nap. So, what do you know? He went from having a paci every day for almost a year, to no paci at all. It's amazing how easy it is to do things like that when they are under 1. They really have no choice in the matter. hehe Anyways, I've been tired out from the crankiness of the baby and the heat. Last night I got to bed at midnight. I'm so proud. Tonight maybe I can go to bed even earlier. It's hard on Wednesdays though. I always feel bored at work. So when I get home, I'm ready to goof off and watch movies and stuff. Not tonight though.

My brother and husband forced me to eat 2 clams. Icky. I put the boys to sleep last night wide awake. They played and laughed in their beds for 30 minutes. I almost decided my experiment was silly, when I heard silence. What a concept. So today I'm trying again. They are VERY tired. So we'll see. Itt would be nice to put them to bed at the same time in the future.

I've been very focused on my/our goals lately. I can see our goals getting closer and closer and it's driving me crazy! I have this give me now mentality. It's terrible, but that's just me. I really have a hard time waiting for things. Especially if the goal is withing my sight. Right now it's the prospect of being debt free within a few months. (I never count school loans when I say debt free..) Then it's the prospect of building credit. All the ways to do that. What would look good on a credit report? What makes it worse? How long until we can get a mortgage? Will the mortgage rates go up by then? All o f that :o) The future is exciting. I'm also happy because it's Summer. I love the sun and the long days. 

Boy I'm worn out though. Micah is getting his first 2 teeth.Not far off from his 1st birthday too. They are both breaking the skin and causing him a terrible amount of pain. He is VERY cranky and can't seem to stop crying. So my days have been even longer because of that. My kids decided to go to sleep now. That is VERY cool. I think they are starting to find comfort in each other's presence when it comes to sleeping. They are also starting to play together and really love each other. I can't wait until Micah decides to walk. He's so close, but so chicken. Elijah was walking at 10 1/2 months. Oh well, maybe soon. 

Anyways, today I have decided to go to bed before 1 or 2. That has been the average bedtime for the last week. No longer! Today we are going to bed early. 11 if I can help it. So off I go. Goodnight"

Then Saturday evening Mat and his girlfriend came over to watch the boys. We rushed off to Taco Bell. No time for a sit down dinner I'm afraid. We had to get to the movie 1 hour early. We got great seats and really enjoyed the Matrix Reloaded. In the end my kids survived, the baby-sitters survived, and we all had a good time goofing off afterward.

Sunday Dan ended up going to church without me. Leif and Dan came back with pizza. That was nice. BBQ chicken. mmmmm....
We goofed off and went over to Leif's house for a BBQ later. Spent all day there until way past the boys' bed time.

Monday morning we decided to drive up to Hood River and visit my brother and SIL who were spending a few nights there. We got there at 3, and had a lot of fun goofing off in their room. We also went to the park and Elijah spent 2 hours throwing rocks in the river. He wouldn't have stopped I'm sure. He took an occasional break to chase a golden retriever or two, but that was it. Dan enjoyed throwing big rocks in the water, and watching Elijah yell and laugh at them. We went to Pizza and the boys (Dan, Will, and Elijah) had a lot of fun winning tickets in the game room. Picking out the perfect prize was fun too. I think they got a little duck finger puppet and a little plastic dog. :) We stayed until really late. My wonder brother suggested getting us a room there at the Hood River Hotel. They paid for one and everything, but in the end they couldn't find the cribs we could use. So we canceled it and drove back around 10. Still fun though.

Yesterday we drove around a bunch and did our usual stuff. Dropped off our seats at the season finales of 24 and Smallville. Well, that's about it. Fun fun fun. Dan'll be going to work in 9 days. I'll miss that guy..."

"event","It's about time I update my journal. It's been forever. I don't have much to say right now, but something will come to me later I bet. Today I'm been anxious to hear about Dan's possible job. No word yet. It's driving me crazy.Dan has been gone today working with my brother. Umm..what else. My boys have icky runny noses. Hopefully they'll be over their colds here soon. Elijah did something neat today. He was sitting on my lap, and he started pointing at my shirt and saying ""A"" ""D"" ""...""O I then looked down and realized he was pointing at those letters on my Old Navy T-shirt. He didn't recognize the L, V, or Y but who cares! I was so proud. :o) What other random thoughts can I think of? Oh, I really want to go see X2. REALLY want to see it. Also the Matrix Reloaded will be out soon, and oh my. This is a terrible time to not have a baby-sitter. I usually don't care if I see movies in theater. I think it's a waste of money if it's a chick flick or something with no special effects. But I REALLY want to see some of these upcoming movies in theater. That's my dream for the week. hehe 
Well, that's about it."

"event","Sooo sitting here and playing Texas Hold'em on line, and drinking a dutch bros coffee.  Things are looking decent, i'm in a better mood then i was in my last blog, which only 2 people have got to read haha so you dont know about that.  But any ways... I'm tired... got less then 5 hours of sleep last night, but o well.  went to melisa's last night, had some bbq chicken... got my first 4 of a kind.. but was not playing for money or chips, so it sucked... Played bingo as well last night... ALMOST won like a thousand dollars, but they would not call the ONE number i needed... bastards... haha jk.. no but really...anyways.. 

2 months to go...Two months to be a kid as much as posible... Two months until i can start looking normal... I do not understand when people tell me they loved being pregnant, they loved the way it made them feel, blah blah blah... I hate it.  I want out, I look like shit, i'm fat, and that in result gets me no guys, i havent had even a kiss in so long.. But o well i spose.. I guess its a part of my mistake... I think the only people who enjoyed being pregnant had a boyfriend/husband that made them feel great, not the pregnancy.  But seriously, if you have a guy when you get pregnant and he sticks around, you have it so much better.. Becuase no guy wants to date a pregnant chick.. O well... I'm scared.. I have no idea what to expect... I kind of wish i was back in idaho at the moment.  I would really enjoy that.  I miss my mom... I miss my animals... i miss my bed... Sleeping on a couch while pregnant is not very comfortable, expesially when sometimes you also have two cats with you... not fun...

Tonight i am probaly going to play poker, mayyybe win some money... i doubt it though, but i think i will get food haha.. not like i need it.  I wake up with heartburn and feel like puking all the time, it really sucks.. I cant sleep sometimes its so bad.. hmmm anyways i'm going to go fall asleep i think"

"event","My feelings have switched like a total 180 degrees over the last couple hours... It's pretty much like i don't want to be here.  What was i thinking.  Seriously.  I don't fit in.  It's not worth it. Just becuase I wouldn't drink anyways if I wernt pregnant doesn't mean I want to watch you get drunk.  Doesn't mean I want to be your excuse to your parents.  Doesn't mean I will drive you everywhere to get drunk.  Last time that will happen.  Yeah hanging out with friends is fun.  But it sucks when you do nothing.  While everyone is talking.  And you sit there, becuase you know why, you don't drink.  THen you feel like shit.  I give up.  Give up on most things.  Guys if you don't want a girl either, tell them, don't make them look like a fool.  Tired of looking like a fool.  Came home last night, huge headache... and theres not one fricken drop of tylenol in this house.  Of couse thats the only thing my doctor allows me to take.  Driving home last night I felt like shit.. I just want to be a kid, want to have no worrys, I want to be skinny again.  I want to have my body back, so guys will actualy take a look at me, not just say ""o shes fat and pregnant haha"" Seriously trying to find a guy while pregnant is fucked up.  O well, guess I put myself in this spot.  Either way, I hate it, I hate me.  Last night.  First night I was thinking to cut for a long time.  Sure I have wanted to before, but with going to a doctor every week, and not really sure if they will take blood, and they always take bloodpressure, i just havnt been able to.  But last night I was going to.  Until there was no blade, and my dad was about to wake up and my sister came home.  Boy was it a releif knowing that I was going to do it.  Kind of a panick when I couldn't find a blade, but either way it felt good knowing something in my past I could still do.  Sisters up...bye"

"event","So... I'm fat and disgusting.. True story

Cleaning my room today made me cry pretty much.. It sucked.  I found all my pictures from last summer... It made me miserable seeing how i was never going to beable to relive moments like that.  The days where me and kim had no fears, calling up random people in the middle of the night to hang out. just having fun doing what ever.  Now i'm fat, pregnant, look like shit 24/7, and lazy with no fun clothes to wear.  I swear if i ever get into fashion it will be CUTE maternity clothes that arent too fricken preppy or old lady like.  

I'm scared.  It sucks.  I have no idea how i'm going to handle this baby.  My family are coming friday, and i'm excited, except for the fact there is probaly going to be tension/drama.  My sister and mom still arnt talking, which pisses me off.  

Talked to my sister about going up to bend on the 26th for the LAO/TOSA show.. she said we could probaly do it.. Woot.. that makes me excited. 

Going to lagoon tommorow.. Rather tonight more.. gotta eb at school at 3:30. why i am going, i dont know, considering i probaly wont beable to ride 90% of the rides, but o well.  

Had a dream about him last night.. Made me sad, made me miss him.  But o well life goes on.  I just need a guy.  I was lookign at the pictures of last summer and saw ones of me and ian.  Even though he wasnt my boyfriend or we wernt even dating, i want a guy like that.  He made me feel awesome.  But o well i wont be getting a guy with this huge belly now, paying for my mistakes."

Never have to go back again.
So releaved.
So scared.
What am I to do with my life now.
What can i do.
I need a guy.
I want to cuddle.
I want to sleep.
I want to be skinny and pretty again.
I wish my mom was more happy for me.
Rather then just saying ""Now your in the real world and it's hard""
No congradulations.
No woohoo's.
Just ""it's not easy""
Wow i love you to.
It's nice to know i'm the first to graduate and only one of her kids to graduate
And i dont even get a GOOD JOB!
Let alone a graduation present.
It made me cry.
But almost anything will these days.
Oregon in 11 days.
SISTER! and father and grandparents will be here in 9. 
I got ripped off.
Cleaned a WHOLE house expecting to get 100 dollars.
Got 60.
What people wrote in my ""year book"" thing, made me feel special.
I'm a hero, inspiration, a strong person, and countless other compliments that i will love and cherish for ever."

"event","Just feel like getting some of my feelings out becuase i'm quite stressed atm. Dont read it and tell me to shut up ect. Becuase i probaly will go off on you. 

I am scared. I hate it, i have never felt like this. I have never felt like maybe I'm doing something wrong. Yeah, i have dont lots of things wrong, but they were little. This is something huge, something that just does not envolve me. I'm excited, I'm worried, I'm anxious, i just have all these feelings and I'm not quite sure what to do. I want this baby with all my heart, in a way i CAN'T wait to have it, I just want to hold it, to feed it, to have a child, to be a mother. But then i think about what i'm giving up. I'm going to lose all my friends, don't say you'll be my friend when i have a kid, becuase most of you are not my friends now. I will have like 2, Kelli whos always been there for me, and kim, who i cant even see when i want, becuase she lives in idaho, other then that i will have no one. Do you know what its like to wish you could just go call some one and hang out with them. It sucks to know that no one wants you in thier lives. I mis oregon so much, you have no idea how much fun i have there, how much more i feel like i belong there. I have friends there, people i can call to hang out, or go see at work. here i have nothing. I have my cats, and the truth is, my pets give me so much more happiness then anything in this world does. I have screwed up my life. I will have no life. Am i ready to just give up being able to be free. I used to be able to just leave when i want, do what i want, and come home when i want. Now i will have to find a babysitter, have to be home when i say i will... not beable to be a kid, a teenager. I have always felt like i have been more ""mature"" by not going out, getting drunk, being stupid. But am i ready to be an adult, a mother.. I have never really had friends to hang out with, but the fact is, what if i find some friends, now i cant be like ""hey lets go hang out"" i will be like ""um i'm sorry i have a kid"" Then there is the topic of guys. Whos going to want to date a chick with a kid. I couldn't find a guy when i was ""skinny"" and childless, let alone how will i find a guy to like me, and my kid. I wont.. Its simple. No guy will want to get envolved with me. I don't blame them. Who wants to be tied down. Call my selfish, but i want a guy. I want to feel loved, i want to feel like i have some one. I miss having a guy to hold my hand, to kiss me on the cheek, to hold my waist. I will never have that ever now. I will end up living with my mom my whole life. I wont have any one, i will only have myself. and my child. Am i wrong to want a boyfriend so bad. I miss what i used to have, i do not miss my ex, i miss what i felt with him. I miss the feeling that i loved some one, that i could just lay down, and forget everything. i don't know. I'm just rambling. Then i'm fat. Dont say ""o its becuase your pregnant"" i dont give a fuck if i'm pregnant, i'm fat. I'm scared. as some of you may know i have struggled w/ eating disorders, and i don't want to fall back into that cycle and put my baby at risk. I was thinkign the other day ""throwing up once or twice a day if i eat to much cant hurt it to much"" How could i think that, how could i even imagine posibly putting my baby at risk. I'm giong to be a horible mother. How am i supposed to raise/feed a kid, when i cant even eat healthy myself. I feel trapped... Then there is school, which just sucks, i couldn't get my math yesterday, i have a test monday, and i almost started crying becuase i dont get the problem. It sucks, i hate crying, let alone in public, OVER A MATH PROBLEM.. it was hard to just not do it, being emotional is so stupid, being pregnant is stupid. Either way, i took a day off of school today. But I have got to get ready for night school <3"

My stomach has been hurting quite badly latley.. And its not going away...Scary.. but o well.. 

Show last night was cool.. peter is hot. Plain and simple, before the show me grace and peter went to chucky Cheese and we played games and such, it was awesome.. Levi was also at the show, kept kissign me on the cheek/head, and it was weird, he gets like that at shows though.. He kept saying how he wants ""to make hot hot love"" and i told him, there can be some ""hot hot making out action, with out the love"" what makes him think hes goign to get anything now, if i wouldnt let him before... fag.. but anyways show was awesome haste the day was good just like before.. and i got a shirt.. So my other haste the day shirt i made into a halter top.. will take pics of that later..

i wake up this morning around 4:50 from a dream... trying to fall back asleep.. Dan calls at 5.. I answer it, i hear andrew (scary boy w/ crush on me from oregon)in the back ground ""Whitney i love you, I love you whitney, I love you, I love you"" yeah, then dan is talking and he sai that Julie dumped him, told him i already knew that, and then he said we will have to hang out when i come back..i just said let me fall asleep..

Monday night.. Poetry read, Mom let me drive, and wanted me to pick her up at 10:30 at the bar.. I argued saying i dont want to becuase i want to be in bed before 10.. She tels me she will call me at 10:30.. K w/e i told her i will skip first period then.  When she finaly calls it is 10:43.. Tells me to pick her up in 20 minutes.. I wait until 11:15 and leave.. Get there at 11:20.. Call her to tell her im there.. She says shes on the way...5 Minutes goes by, i call again, once again she says shes on her way...5 more minutes go by.. i call again.. another 5 minutes go by before shes actualy out there... so i sat in the car for 15 minutes waiting for her.. We go home, its 12:00 by the time i get into bed, so the next morning when my mom tries to wake me up, i tell her im not going to wake up.. Ended up staying home.. And playing EQ2 all day long.. 

k so Kim is feeling like im not liking her... heres the deal, when i go back to oregon, i dont want to feel like a third wheel th whole time.. Its hard enough wanting to have a guy, to hold, to call yours with out seeing you best friend happy with a guy, and when you are talking to her face to face, her and her boyfriend kiss out of no where.. gets to you.. o well. im doomed to live this life alone i bet..But yeah, i wrote Jeff becuase he asked about it, and i told him everything.. it sucks when you put out so many feeling to a person you barely know.. But i guess its good, becuase right now im bottling my feelings up, and i know im going to break down soon, wether its cuttng or what ever, i know im going to do something.  meh, we will all live..

So im playing EQ2 last night.. And out of no where my phone rngs.. i lok and there is erics name.. I was happy he actualy called, so i ask if he wants to come over... He shows up, and before anything good could happen, my mom comes home, so i was pissed haha.. but o well i spose.. Why i have a crush on that boy is beyond my comprehension, i just wish it could progress.. but i know it wont.. there fore i dont even try.

Liking boys that live far away sucks. 

Boys likeing you that live in oregon is scary.. He tells me that he wants to take me out to dinner and sutff whe i get back.. He said ""its so stupid, once i finaly connect with a girl, she leaves me"" i hung out with this guy twice.. he doesnt know me...but yeah, its scary

Talked to my dad last night for like 3 minutes.. I leave for oregon on the 17th, come back on the 3rd..17 days there.. will be awesome.. hopefully. I finished a camisole the other day, its cute, gotta take pics..

Over rated things: (list i have been making)
-Nightmare Before X-mas.. --- I really dont think that it is a great movie.
-Spongebob--- hes fucking gay
-Invader Zim--- Actualy i have never watched it, but i dont want to
-Boyfriends--- Becuase i dont have one haha
-Grades--- Your grades in high school affect everything when they shouldnt
-Friends--- THey all end up backstabbing you
-The blood brothers--- They suck, they sound way whiney, shoot me for this i dont give a crap

Things that annoy me:
- My cat drooling on me
- People who wear fake glasses--- Come on get a life, dont be gay, dont try to be blind when your not, if you want galsses so bad, i will trade you my vision for yours and you put up with annoying contacts, ugly glasses and not beign able to see when you dont have them on.
-Girl who wear skirts with stupid ugly skate shoes like vans or something--- its so ugly, get some dress shoes, learn how to dress.
-How my dog barks at every little thing
-How immature girls are
-When guys wear those ugly brown shows that are from payless or something if a guy wears those, i will not even think about going out with him
-Peopel who ask if my peircings hurt--- Any needle going through your body will hurt
-When eyeliner leaves a black crease above your eye
-When people complain about the ""scene""--- Get the fuck over it and shut up
-When people complain about sxe, make fun of it, ect.--- Fuck you, and ifyou do this around me there may be a chance that i wont talk to you.. respect my choice and my way of life, and maybe i will respect you.

and they will be continued"

But my mom felt guilty, and let me drive her car!! omg it was so awesome. So i drove there, and went inside the show, and no body from kuna was there, so i hung out with batty, and i went to look at the merch.  The Merch guy for Scars of tommorow, stole me On Broken Wings pen. Hehe it was ok though becuase he was cute.  Then he introduced me to some of the band members, and he told me to buy a shirt, so i needed money.  Then i remembered i needed gas.. but there was a problem.. I dont know how to pump gas.   haha.. thats what i get for living in oregon my whole life.  So the Bassist from Scars of Tommorow, drove with me to the gas station and pumped my gas!! omg it was awesome, haha he is so hot, and he huged me at the end of the night, it was really swell.. but yeah, they are coming back next month, and i'm sooo going to see them.. haha.. but yea, well i am at school, so now im going to go, ciao <3"

Of course i'm going, so i say yes, and he siad he would meet me there and hang out :-D, So i show up about the same time as he did, and we hung out, mike and all them went down to the record exchange, and chris and I went to Flying M.. and he bought coffee.. and then walked back and hung out.. it was so awesome, he's so funny, i have such a crush on him.  So i introduced him to Mike.. and we just hung out, then LAO came on, so i went inside, then Pirk's and i skanked haha.. gotta love it.  yep yep, so it was an awesome night al in all, got a few kisses, and just having his arm around me was nice.. Matt was there, and i was sopposed to cuddle with him at some point in time, and i felt bad becuase chris was like holding my hand and such, then Joe was there, and it was weird cuase of the whole joe me thing.. but o well all in all it was awesome.. Soo chris was online when i got home, and he asked what is the deal between us... like usual i got all shy, and blushing, and giggly haha, it was funny, and he siad he liked me, and he knew we just talked about casual making out, but he really liked me, and how he could be just dumb around me and not care, and i told him i liked him too blah blah blah, and he asked me to go to dinner with him sunday.. soo woot.. im excited haha.. but i donno, i dont know if i want a boyfriend atm.. I like being single to a point, but i do not like being alone, but i have a crush on matt, and plus if i move to oregon it will be hard, and over thanksgiving seeing dan and such, i will just have to say no, if we even do go out..wow this is pretty long, so im going to go soon..

Other then that, I have been playing EQ, or looking at random stuff on LJ..  I'm going to try to write in this every day.. but we will see what happens, with me being lazy and all."

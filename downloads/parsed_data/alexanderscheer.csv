to add insult to injury...my bank debit mastercard was stolen today.

funny thing is, it only has about $8.00 in my checking account.

grad school is going to kill me.  i hope me loans will cover it.  if not, you'll see me with the signs on the streets of vancouver of photos i took this past fall.  you'll see them if i put them online.

"event","I still didn't get any sleep.

A friend from Kansas (not paperbrigade.com) called up and we're (plus about 75 other guys) gonna hang out and get insanely drunk.  Sounds like fuuuun.

Then my big brother emailed me wondering where the fuck I was.  We plan to hang out when I get back to Tejas soon.  And I plan to hit up Houston, because it's a tie between moving there and Dallas (Arlington).  Now all I need are hot women (you know who you are) to persuade me to either city.

I'm still fucked up from Percocet and some weird new sleeping pill.  Back to sleep.

P.S. - I'm working on a very cool community-type project for those from or living in Orange County.  Fun times."

"event","They always fight; even on speakerphone two continents apart.  It's morning and I'm tired of all this shit going on...didn't sleep at all.  My mother is very much on the brink of (another) divorce, except this time to a complete asshole instead of an amazing man who came out.  (Yeah, my life is that interesting.)  I just want this to all go away.  Hit up some H, call my mom while I'm high, go to sleep - or maybe hang around Alexanderplatz and look at the tourists.

It's official, I have an ear infection.  A bad one, as well.  I'm on these antibiotic eyedrops that hurt like FUCK.  PLUS, since God hates me, he made my eyes fuck up too.  Either I can't see at all, I have blurred vision, or my left eye is completely blind.  For now my sight is okay at best.  Tomorrow I'll haggle with the insurance company to cover the cost of Lasik surgery...I can't afford that shit at all.

I'm going to end up at several grad schools...Rutgers, Columbia, Dartmouth, Rice, etc.  Or just move, hang out, do lots of drugs and do nothing.

Okay, back.

I should be leaving in a day or two.  I'm having my flatmates sell my shit and, hopefully, give me the profits.  I'm flying into Newark, so if you wanna hang out in North Jersey or even ""the city,"" let me know."

my mother has been awesome enough to record project greenlight and burn it on dvd for me to watch.  its defintely one of my favorite shows, by far, but a little worse this season since its not on hbo.  no one fucking ruin this for me by spoiling each week's episode (i'm one week behind on it, because of shipping).  i'd like to comment on my undying affection for liveplanet here, but, it might seem a little retarted to make my love for affleck, bailey, damon and moore public.

<strike>people</strike> i think of the weirdest shit in the shower.  i don't masturbate in the shower, so its not THAT; and here's to hoping my flatmates don't either.  i thought about julia stiles.  why, i'm not sure.  this is probably a sign of something bigger in my life...i just need to interpret it.  yeah.

i think more and more about flying into houston anyway, just for the hell of it.  but, what would i do?  none of my friends live in houston (they're all in dallas now), everyone i used to know i don't know anymore, and out of those people, i would only want to meet up with one and only one of them.  i'd probably stay in a hotel room and only go out to go to galveston.  or to get some vietnamese food?  eh?

i just realized i haven't taken a shower in two days now; i feel so fucking dirty, especially after drinking so much.  my morning was spent reading celebrity blogs...don't ask.  specifically kevin smith's and zach braff's.  that got my mind off of the coverage of the terri schiavo debacle; its even making the news here.  the mere fact that this has been going on for fifteen years makes me nauseous.  anyway...

i'm waiting for my better half (aka my hetero life-mate) to show up so we can go oot for some grindage...but i feel content lying down on the floor playing the internet game.  a shower before dinner would probably be a wise choice; time to hit that up.

"event","- i think i have the onset of a bad ear infection.  my left ear is plugged, itches like hell and is beginning to hurt.  sounds like another trip to my GP.

- even though i'm on a lot of pain medication...i got moderately drunk last night.  once again playing the duck hunt drinking game.

- one of my flatmates, jonas, picked up two danish girls at a hostel last night and invited them to stay over.  so far they've been bugging the shit out of me to use my laptop, leaving a huge mess in the kitchen, putting my american dvds in the german dvd player and using the phone to make phone calls...and i doubt they'll pay towards the phone bill.  why can't he use hookers like the rest of us?

another reason i <strike>feel like</strike> am an outsider:  a lot of people feel its okay to have conversations in fast german, or bavarian - both of which i cannot understand for the life of me.  i'm only blessed with a half-assed berlin accent or the ability to understand ""standard"" german.  german is a lot more confusing than one would think.  fuuuuck.

i'll make this quick since we're leaving in a few.

wahhh i don't want to leave here ever.  friends, food, (lots of) alcohol, seeing my roommate on television, subways and trains, cold weather, foreign women.  but i've booked my plane already - using up all my frequent flier miles i got first class all the way.  fuckyeah.  but i'm still stuck here until my new emergency passport and other shit that was stolen gets here.

ummmm...okay time to go even though i'm already tired.

i can't stop thinking about a girl i've had a crush on for a considerable amount of time.  she is whoa hot, whoa cool, and just...omg whoa.  after i return to america i'd like to hang out, but i know she thinks i'm a total schisse.  bummer indeed.  why oh why?  i have a college education, multiple nationalities, a great career, balanced social life.  who could want more?  plastic surgery?  a very large swiss bank account?  damnit.  :/

oh yeah, i used to be a really shitty person.  that's it.  too bad i finally grew up.

that's about it.  returning to america in a few days.  big decisions to make in the very near future.  huge, bro.

barbie and i are going to get our olive garden on in a few - i haven't eaten all day and i'm starrrrrving.  i want something with a fuckload of cheese.

time for a cigarette and the last beer in the fridge.  mental note to pick up some booze on the way back."

"event","so my roommate's dog, ethan, has been nothing but a total shit.  he's pissed on every square inch of carpet in our apartment, he's puked and pissed all over the backseat of my roommate's car, and he's woken up the neighbors at god-awful times of the morning, leaving us with two complaints (we're not even supposed to have pets, and the fine is $550).  so we've made a mutual decision to give him up.  we both pretty much hate him now, and we can't afford to get fined that and be evicted because of a malfunctioning stray dog.  criticize me all you want, but its just not a healthy environment for all of us - my roommate, me, and her two cats.  stupid fucking dog.

yes i will be returning to berlin for a few days in early march.  i plan on subletting my flat, furnished and located near alexanderplatz and the second biggest park in berlin (go see the bourne supremacy and the whole world clock scene with matt damon and julia stiles is near my flat).  anyway, if you can afford 1200 euros a month (probably something like $1300 US) and want to live in the greatest city in europe for a while, then by all means rent.  fuckyeah.

my international mobile number has not changed, so keep dialing that london phone number.  i never hear from anyone anymore.  or just fucking sms me.

that's it.  i've been up all night, i reek of stupid fucking dog, and i need to shower and change like whoa.  this is a better blogging space than my diaryland, which i can use for being ""artistic"" in my writing.

for the few of you who don't know, i've been living all over the world for a while.  well, not really all over the world, but in berlin (germany) and i just recently moved to bellingham (washington), about 80 miles north of seattle, and 40 miles south of vancouver (canada).  i'm subletting my apartment in berlin and my room in l.a...mostly because i can't pay rent for three places at the same time.  anyway, i quit my job working in the glorious entertainment industry and have been working as a photographer pretty much full-time.  its fun.  except paying back the loans i got to pay for a ton of new equipment.  oh well.

finally my application for my german passport was approved, but i have to find the nearest consulate to pick them up at.  i think the closest one is in san francisco, or maybe there's one in vancouver.  who knows.  the photographs i had to take for it and for my permanent citizen card look quite interesting.  very.

god i've been wicked sick for the past week and i can't seem to kick it...not even antibiotics are helping.  extra strength vicodin is my current best friend to help me rest, but i've been taking so much that i think the tylenol component in it is making me even more sick.  yuck.  

anyway, i'll update later.  i'm so fucking tired.

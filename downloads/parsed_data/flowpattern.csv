I want to upgrade the RAM for my laptop. While doing so I would like to go as large as an upgrade as I can.

Have a Sony Vaio vgn-nr110e/s. [ddr2 pc2-4200 533MHz]

I've done some light research and although the specs say the max ram it can take is 2gb. I've read that it can go up to 3.5gb. I wanted your input on a number of things. Should I just go for the 2gb upgrade and leave it using a dual interface or use one 2gb and one 1 gb for 3gb. Also, if using the PC2-5300 is fine even though it runs higher then the pc2-4200 thus possibly causing a bit of lag. Last but not least where can I find a cheap ones that are of good quality."

"event","So I've realized that I have a small crush on a bartender. Which has made me evaluate my past infatuations. Let's go through that portal into the recesses of my mind. To the beginning or nearly so, as far as my engrams will take me. Naturally the more recent the event the more detailed it will be.<lj-cut>

Five years old is the youngest I remember that my 'heart' felt something. Her name was Bethany she lived across the street and was in my Kindergarten class. To this day I'm not really sure what it was I felt for her. Too young to understand, all I know is that I eminently enjoyed spending time with her. Stephenie was another girl that I liked but I couldn't stand her tickling me all the time so it turned into annoyance. <font size=""-2"">[Yes I'm aware of the irony]</font> Then there was the older girl next door we flirted a little she enjoyed getting me wet. It was over the fence relationship. So this was when she was water the plants in the backyard.

Then when I was seven I met Lisa, she had a little girls group and I volunteered to be her bodyguard. Then I knew more about what I felt, I think she felt the same, but we were young and never discussed what we felt, we spent a lot of time together. She moved away, though my sister told me that the day she left <font size=""-2"">[I was sick]</font> she was disappointed. Wasn't there so she asked Betty to say goodbye for her. My heart broke for the first time. I pined for the rest of that year. I sat were she used to sit and felt a great regret that I never really expressed my feelings to her. Even if I didn't fully understand them myself. That following year I met a pretty girl Tia but all I could acknowledge was that she was pretty. My heart was still empty.

It might have been around this time that I limited myself on how freely I showed emotion. Contributing factors were the simple fact that I never stayed long anywhere. This effectively controlled my heart for quite a few years. 

Middle school I met a girl named Crystal. Though I think it was her purity and how friendly she was that attracted myself and a few of my classmates to her. We were really good friends but nothing more. She wanted me to go to the same High school as her but I declined, was tempted.

High school I slightly wavered but I kept it in line. Never acting on any sort of spark. Turned down a few offers. <font size=""-2"">[Flirted I'm told but I didn't view it as such.]</font> Yet after High school I sort of started again, though very cautiously. 

Won't be naming names after this since it's getting recent.

In college I had a few crushes and acted on some instincts. Parties led to other forms of outlets.

There was this girl at this party during this time. <font size=""-2"">[Cryptic enough?]</font> We had a small thing for a couple of months but things just drifted. It was the whole meeting at a party more of a fling not going to last scenario. A floor mate that I'm sure was only a one way attraction. There was also a girl in Cali that my brother introduced me to but I ended that after the two week that I was there. Logically it wasn't going to last the long distances. Plus my brother just wanted me laid since he thought I was too reserved. Then there was this lady that I met online, it was friendship at first. We enjoyed talking about random things. We kept it up for about a year and half until we finally met. We had fun I felt like how I was before I closed myself off from making friends. A little weird when we hung out at some teenagers place that we just met to smoke a hookah. Yet I enjoyed the basic things. During this time somehow my feeling of friendship went to something more. My logic, reserved self went out the window. I told her how I felt but she didn't really feel the same. Sure she liked me as well but didn't really want a relationship. I understood especially the way we met. We stayed in touch as best as I could since I was working. Was texting her but since I got off so late I stopped. It kept waking her up. Later I learned that she'd started something with another person. So I stopped. Not sure if she was testing me or moved on or what. Yet I wasn't going to play the competing game. After hearing her mention one time about a past boyfriend and a startling little quirk he had I later commented that I had the same just for my own amusement, childish I know but it was were I was at in the moment. Still went out with her when I was in town. Though I was tired form work and I wasn't liking where things were heading. Telling her how I felt and ending up as friend she just wanted to hang out with. Then I met this other girl moved on yet I felt like I might be rebounding. So it wasn't continued. 

In a sense I just closed up again. 

Lately I've found myself attracted to women that are taken. Might be a defense that I'm doing. It's were I'm at right now. 

Any questions? <font size=""-2"">[No I'm not going to revise this.]</font>"

I know from environment the body can develop early, but psychologically they shouldn't be thinking of this for at least another 3-4 years. Sure we thought about it at 13 but we never acted on it until much later. How are these kids being raised? They should be playing. Your thoughts?

<lj-cut text=""I would put my thoughts but this person hit it on the nail.""> 

deeznuts33442:
<blockquote>I don't know what shocks me more: this story, or the fact that I wasn't at all surprised by it. I'm only 20, but there's still a huge generational gap between people my age, and those who are even 4-5 years younger. Even my brother, who is 2 years younger than I am, also notices this. In middle school (ages 10-13), we were just kids. Yeah, we realized that hey there's this gender and we like them, but it was more just talk than anything. There was maybe a total of 4-5 couples that I knew of in the entire school of 1200-1500. This stuff mostly started at the end of 7th or 8th grade, and it was just harmless stuff, going to the movies that type of thing. In my brother's year, 3 years behind me in school, this stuff started more at the end of 6th or 7th grade. Now, I overhear 9 and 10-year olds going off about ""boyfriend this"" and ""girlfriend that"" on their cellphones (why a 10-yr-old needs a cellphone, I have no clue), and it's like ""whoah what just happened?""

I go to the mall and see 12-year-old girls walking around in skintight tops that barely cover enough to keep them from getting arrested, the side straps of their thong emerging at an outrageous angle from their low-rise jeans and I'm like ""what the f*ck happened in the past 7-8 years?""

Sure, the media is partly to blame. Just look at the Bratz dolls for an example of how ""sexy/skanky"" is marketed to kids. However, most of the responsibility lies with the parents. Too many of them don't know how to say ""no"" to their kids, or are absentee workaholic parents who try to buy their kids' love out of guilt for not being there. Any parent who lets their 11-year-old daughter out the door when she's dressed like a hooker, or allows her to buy thongs, super-short skirts, and ultra-revealing semi-see-through tops should be shot. Any parent who gives their 12-year-old son a credit card and says ""I'm gonna drop you off at the mall, go buy whatever you want"" should be shot too. And any parent that doesn't teach their kids respect and common courtesy should be drawn and quartered.

I hate to sound like an old geezer at 20, but the generation gap even over 7-8 years is huge. It seems almost every day I see at least 5-10 kids whose parents need a swift kick in the ass. Don't be afraid to tell your kid no. If you don't, one day he/she will realize that, in fact, the world does not revolve around them; if you don't teach your kids right from wrong and how to act, they're going to end up learning it the hardest way possible. </blockquote>"

Guilt is a funny thing. More so if it is committed unknowingly, but stumbled upon. The only course of action is to come clean and hope that even if it can't be forgiven it doesn't destroy what you have. There can be no repayment, only what is asked of you. Yet that will never fully erase what has transpired. Learn from your mistakes and let it live as reminder to be wiser.

"event","I've come to question relationships and how every one's perception is different and how the thing we call entertainment has altered it. Let's focus on this nation for the present moment. Though we should clarify what a relationship means... a connection between two individuals, ideally having common interests and feeling complete in the presences of the other. Having that enhanced to a greater degree by the intimacy shared between the two.

Let's ignore at the present our own nature or interpretation of what average or acceptable should be. Since its mainly the sum of every one's past experience and what they've allowed. So the only course is to extract from points in our history and try and understand, hoping we made a correct assumption that isn't bias. Though I think that we can all agree that none of us are living as we truly want to. Or rather we're not living harmoniously thus the unhappiness and divorces. Sorry, I'm jumping ahead of myself.

Let's not go back to the rape and feral nature of our impulses to mate. Granted it's still there but we now have that under control. So how about the time United States formed, if you can actually call it the United States other counties in central and south America were already calling themselves that but for some reason it didn't stick as what we now consider it. Presumably the size.

So it's the 18th century. Time when courtship is still a lengthy process. To be blunt the girl is not going to be putting out and chances are once the dates ended the man leaves even more frustrated interpreting his lust for love, though he may be in love but mounted on it there's lust, or found himself a prostitute. While the young lady is also flushed but ignorant on such things. Non likely to be masturbating since such a thing is a wicked act. So the couple get married. Roughly around this time, actually around 100 years later, honeymoon becomes popularized. Let's be frank if at one point before this we as a race were well informed on the opposite sex and sex it's now been lost. Honeymoons were meant for us to privately discover the person we married and it wasn't romantic. Discovery was awkward and sadly to say some found it revolting, presuming some Greek sculpture as the ideal model. 

Let's not even mention how things were in the lawless west where the etiquette of the east won't draw to survive.

They remain together, if they love each other or not is never discussed. Society has them together. Divorce though known is unthinkable, they'll remain together until death.

It's likely that the couples of the 19th century aren't as happy as history would have us see them. Women are to be fridge and care only for the house and children.. Relationship to their counterparts seem to be minimal. (Then again the mind set that they had they may have been. We just can't precieve it.)

Luckily we move beyond that stage, women now have a voice, they've discover sexuality, equality has almost been reached. I love the little excerpt where women are first treated by vibrators to cure a ""mental sickness,"" requiring weekly treatments.

Well that time will suit well for a reference point.

After the second women's right movement relationships take a more active role by both parties. With it though also comes complications. Morals are ever evolving. Cultural differences. Television involvement, all of it has left us all on different pages. Broadcasting programing has possibly left us for worse then anything else. In order to supply drama and suspense multiple relationships emerge. The fact that we can be in love with two people at once or falling in an out of love at a drop of a pin.

Now not everyone falls under this, but we have the problem that what we see is what we're taught is a probable acceptance in human behavior. Now this may not be the entire case since most of us have some other source to learn how to behave. So that mediocrely solves most of those problems. Yet we each end up with different values, this isn't bad just a bit of challenge to find a common ground. Actually its something nice, a stronger bond is made, both sides working to find that unison.

We've been told that two conflicting stories, each contain a grain of truth. One that a relationship thrives by being honest. Second that it dies once all the mystery is gone i.e. you know everything about the other individual and they become predictable. Though these are good points there is something more that is hard to convey into words, a look, a touch... something soulful, passion that should always remain even if just embers. For it leaves the option of being re lit. Since we all should know this isn't something rigid but divergent, you handle it as best you can for there is no real book that has all the answers.

I've been called an old soul and I agree with it, once I view how an average stand point is. Though this is going to cause problems. Painful ones. Though it also may not. <i>Qui vivra verra.</i>

Yeah I analysis too much.


Yeah where the hell did all of this come from? (I should really revise this but it's late and I always hated doing that.)"

"event","Yeah on a related subject I've been half trying to find a special paperback edition of The Amber Spyglass. The reason is I already have the first two, now normally I wouldn't bother to go looking for a paperback on a book that I like but since I've preserved the other two I wouldn't mind getting the third.

"event","I can't wait for this coming December, though with the anticipation comes doubt. My favorite series will be making it's debut on film at long last. Before I read this I was only reading to pass the time and because I was told to. This was my first introduction to fantasy/sci-fi, and I got hooked hardcore. It may have been the entanglement of religion that was tied into it, won't say that I've read the entire bible or that I understood it all, at the age I was at, but before this book I had read about a sixteenth of it. (I don't know, they gave me a bible and seemed to be really happy that I read a little every night, granted it was one of those bibles translated for children so no complex words, just what they considered the direct meaning.) So I had a good reference, of the beginning.

It was refreshing to see someone's possible interpretation and mixing it with a compelling story. One of reaching adulthood and the intelligence/imagination of children before they have their minds constricted by age. Shedding into light that what was written may or may not be true. 

I know no film will ever live up to any book but I hope it reaches the level of Narnia and Lord of the Rings.

So all of you should set Dec. 7, 2007 free to watch this."

"event","I've been told on many occasions by Thomas that I should keep my guilt out of this or something similar. In a comment about the guilt I was radiating. Now while I have commented on my own feelings of regret for matters that I may have done or thought. I don't think that I've projected that to any of you. Also I don't really think that I fall under this stereo typical catholic persona. Let's not even take into account that I haven't gone to mass in like a year. But the fact that the 'hot topic' issues on catholic guilt that have been stated don't even apply to me, well only 18% do but that's still really low.

The Guilt that I've felt apply to small matters that I've all but resolved and have in no way tried to apply to you. I may have felt guilty about it but I didn't judge anyone who also did it. They can live their lives however they want, it was my own personal battle. Nothing more."

"event","Yeah I have way to much crap to review all of my posts. Most of them were just childish things that didn't mean much, a few I actually was being honest and a few I was building on things that weren't there to make an interesting post. Though overall I seemed to be a really tormented soul, not saying that I'm not. Though it's not as bad as how I've posted it to be. What I'm referring to was on August 3, 2004. Just bottling things up that's all it was.

<blockquote>[FLASHBACK]
I was a young boy still living in Bellingham so before my teens. I was in a summer school thing, those ones your parents stick you in because they're to busy to watch you during the summer. We spent the time just doing activities to pass the day... well I'm regressing. The event was one sunny day in which we all went to Lake Padden.

Can't remember if we just went there to be there or we actually had a plan. What I enjoyed most about that day is I got partnered up with a tight group. The adventures type. Instead of sticking to the lake or field we went on the trails. Now when I say that I don't mean the human made trails that all parks have. Sure we entered that way but we took the deer trails and made a few of our own. It was fun, us jumping the creeks, getting muddy and building a small shelter. Which I'm pretty sure is still there. Yeah just love nature I miss moments like these. Time standing still for your youthful eyes to appreciate the beauty. The crisp clean air. The silence that isn't. 
[/FLASHBACK]</blockquote>
Yeah fond memories."

Well I had fun... went to a nice restaurant ordered two beers and had a nice dinner. Tasted one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had, white chocolate berry. The waitress told me it was down hill from this point and I had to correct her, it's only down hill after this weekend.

Other then that nothing else to comment besides my reserved side trying to regain control and placing all of these thoughts... that while true I should probably ignore."

"event","Well I'll start off by saying I'm no expert on the past. I just dab in some periods. Nor that I know anything about the cold war, except the superficial, oh and The U2 incident that I did research for.

That said I really enjoyed The Good Shepherd. Not only did it show the struggles and sacrifice of a man dedicated to his country. Though best of all I got to see the view of social interaction of the time. Sure it was probably more morbid then an average family but I feel it was accurate. It even corrected some of the views that I had. It also confirmed my view that we're all right and are just trying to find a balance. Some more then others, tipped to their side. I mean Cuba was sick and tired of the U.S. abusing them like they have so when they were given another outlet they took it. 

It was by no means a happy movie, but it was great nonetheless. I recommend it to anyone who likes to think and reflect on ourselves and history."

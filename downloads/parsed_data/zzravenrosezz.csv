"event","I'm torn between the feeling of needing to shout at the top of my lungs and make everyone listen, and being respectful and safe.

I wish I were in a position to have my voice heard, respected and without fear of repercussions whether verbal, physical or in my career.

So as the title hints, I'm so sick of sexism in gaming.

This past week I attended GDC, <b>Game Developers Conference</b>, in San Fran.  Its places like this where I really see the gender gap in my industry.  There was an estimate 50,000 attendees this year and I bet 90% of them were male.  One upside is there was never a wait for the bathroom, but there are plenty of downsides.  I will be the first to say that things are getting better but I'm impatient, I want them to be perfect now.

I was exhibiting my game in the <b>Orlando Booth</b>, a major feat for my age and duration in the industry.  But the experience was dampened by constant <b>inherent sexism</b>.  People never think I'm a developer or have anything to do with this STEM field.  At best they assume I'm a developer's girlfriend, at worst they think I'm the hired showgirl.  When they find out I am a developer they automatically assume I'm an artist, because what girls can't program?  And recently I'm mad that I am an artist and can't throw it back in their face.  Also when I greet them with confidence and speak more than any of my colleges they say they knew I was the PR and biz dev person because of how I present myself.  Can a female not be confident and knowledgeable without her role dictating it from her?  Do they assume that if I were not a Biz Dev and PR I would be meek and quiet in the corner?

What's really bothering me now is the picture above.  The comment is from a college and is hitting me hard.  If it were the first comment I've received like this I could just shrug it off, but its not.  If you call me out for something I want it to be my skills, not because I'm prettying up the photo.  Don't make me your token female.  I've contributed just as much to our community, the booth and my studio as any of the men and they aren't reduced to their reproductive parts and attractiveness.  

I won the Xbox <b>Women in Gaming</b> Game Changer contest for GDC so I attended all sorts of events with other up-and-coming women and well established women and men in the industry.  GDC was very gender focused for me.  It was great to see how far women have come in the industry but as much as it was inspiring it was also a major downer for me.  Every single one of those women had to overcome adversity due to their sex.  They probably had to work harder and still earn less than any of their male coworkers.  I'm not hating on men, I don't blame anyone in particular, I'm just expressing my frustration.  I know there's no quick fix and I just have to endure and push through for myself and for other women to come but its hard."

"event","I get to go to the doctor today.  I'm finally going to do it.  I'm getting anti anxiety medicine.  I'm tired of feeling this way.  I don't know if its natural anymore.  I used to think it was but now I don't even care.  I just don't want it so if there's a pill to make it go away, then bring it on.  

<!--
SO I do some BDSM things now, I really like it.  Most of it.  I worry that I play along sometimes, and Idk if I do because I'm apathetic or if I actually like it.  Its weird.  I don't like how easily influenced by a man I am.  Hes going to propose and I'm worried I don't know what love is anymore and how to tell if I have it.  I love him, he does a lot for me, he makes me happy, my family loves him but recently there have been some problems.  And I know I could easily solve them by speaking up.  But I want him to do what he wants and have fun.  I just wish we were on the same page about what that means.  He wants a threesome and to have another girl Domme him.  I don't think I want that.  I think it'll be really hard for me, and I wont enjoy it unless I'm super drunk.  So I can be loose and not worry or care.  Maybe these meds will help make me relax.  But then I'm like, do I need to relax?

So this other domme came over, first of all I'm not attracted to her personality or looks.  Hahah so what do we have?  NOTHING.  But whatever, Greg thinks I'm too picky and I'll never find someone.  And maybe that's true, but hey I found him.  So she came over twice, we played games, talked, got to know each other.  I thought 2 times seeing a new person is find for getting to know each other.  Apparently they both don't think that.  The second time they both wanted to dive right into BDSM and sexual stuff.  I'm sorry I don't work that way and I dont like feeling blamed for them not having a fun night.  If you don't like how I do things, find another person.  And I'll find another person who doesn't have a problem with things that are fundamentally me.  I don't think I would be unhappy being single forever.  I could just have carefree fun, no complications.  No one to project their feelings, ideas, or whatever on me.  So 5AM came, and I have to be at work by like 11am, I didn't want to stay up that late in the first place but I was making an effort.  Socializing, you know.  But its fucking bedtime.  So they are both disappointed, the little fucks.  So I give her, Belinda (I dont like her name, shes not pretty!) permission to play with my slave.  I tell her no fingering, blowjobs, eating out, sex, handjobs.  What I didnt fucking know is that if I don't spell every little fucking thing out that they'll do it, or find a loop hole.  I""M STILL SO FUCKING PISSED.  I need to calm the fuck down.  I need medicine so I stop freaking out.  So I'm assuming there will be BDSM crap happening, because before she even came over I told Greg I don't want any sexual stuff going on, and I'm not comfortable with intimacy.  So they are making out on the guest bed, grinding on each other and who the fuck knows what else.  I give it an HOUR, a FUCKING HOUR, do you know how much I'm dying.  I cant take it, I think about stabbing myself in the heart, tearing my skin open, anything so I don't have to feel my heart fucking trying to throw itself out of my chest.  Its awful.  I still feel it right now.  AND DOESN""T HE KNOW BETTER?  I really want to put him in the same situation.  I know he wouldn't be ok with it.  FUCK GIVE ME DRUGS and ALCOHOL, I need it.  I'm trying not to be an alcoholic but I keep going for it.  Whatever, I'll have drug to calm me and I just won't give a fuck.  I just need to distance myself from Greg if he wants to have this type of fun.  It would, and was, ok at the beginning of our relationship.  He had another slave he was sleeping with and I didn't care.  WHY THE FUCK DO I CARE NOW.  I wish I didn't.  I really ddo.  I just want to movee on and stop feeling this.  But it keeps getting brought up.  I keep learning new things, like she was going to rub herself on him until she orgasmed.  SO IF I DONT SAY NO ORGASMING YOU""RE GOING TO DO IT?  And Greg is going to let her!??!  UGHHHHH.  I specify handjob, blowjob, fingering and eating out, but not rubbing until you get off.  I dont like this word game.  I think its disrespectful and I makes me hate her.

"event","It's really hard not to drink or take pills or both at times like these. That makes it sound like it's happened frequently. It hasn't. I guess I just don't know what to do. And I need a distraction. Liquid courage. Shove stuff down my throat to keep the vomit down. So dramatic. But when I'm super anxious I feel like vomiting. And I shake. I think the vomit is honestly control. A self induced vomit to know I control something. At least my own body. It's a lot like cutting in that respect. I'm dizzy. From the medicine I took earlier. I'm going to take a hot bath to hopefully stop the shaking."

"event","First of all I can't believe I've had this thing this long.  Actually I don't even know how long I've had it.  Wow since 2004, so middle school.  Seems about right, I was very angsty then.  Nearly 600 entries and that's without the hundred or so of the worst ones that I deleted one time my mother discovered my online journal.  I used to regret deleting them, but some memories you don't want to revisit.  But I just read one from 2009, that period, and it was really awesome.  I can't sleep.  I still prefer sleeping when the suns up, but I wish I didn't.

<!-- To the nitty gritty.  I'm excited and worried about the future.  I think its all for the best.  I'm regretful its taken this long for me to see.  I'm upset that I let myself get this fat too.  I know its because I've been unhappy but still thats no excuse.  I should just not eat again like 2009, that was extreme unhappiness and feeling soooooo out of control.  I didn't weight myself but I was sooo small.  Whatever I don't feel like spelling everything out.  You know what I'm referring too.  My birthday this year, 25th, was great.  Honestly.  But I wish it wasn't only once.  Or that there was this much silence.  I know this is a busy time of the year especially with his move but whatever.  You know.-->"

"event","Thank you Secondhand Serenade for always provided the deafeningly loud soundtrack to my PMS.  I swear the angel of PMS sent them to me how else would I find Secondhand Serenade singing Coldplay's Fix You.  And the ever good Johnny Cash singing Nine Inch Nails, Hurt.  

Its just one of those nights.  I haven't had one of these nights in a long long time.  Long long time.  And I'm not even going to hide it.  I don't know if that's me being attention-seeking or being different and open.  So one of those nights....those unreasonably sad nights.  Its a little early too for it.  1am is early.

It's probably that I secretly reread Twilight this week, lol it only took me 3 days of breaks at work.  And it brought me back to that mind set, which was good until now.  And I can't even say that this mind set now is bad.  Its the same but I'm different.  I'm not...nevermind, its not even like that anymore.  

Ok, a moment of self-awareness just passed.  Here's my problem: ever since solving my ""issues"" (we all should know the issues of which I speak, they are written on my arm) I've become super uptight.  In hopes of being a better person, of being a person I wanted to be.  But now that I'm more or less the person I wanted to be I need to be less extreme.  That's another problem of mine, I'm too extreme.  I'm ""me"" around certain people like Abi and Sean, definitely Sean but I'm uptight me around Jorge.  Like I don't curse around Jorge and I really don't like him cursing.  I mean I don't curse a lot in general, mainly just when drinking, but I don't have any problems with cursing, if appropriate.  Appropriate means not out of any strong emotion, anger, sadness, etc.  Also I'm a flirtatous person, I'm sure Abigail and friends from high school can attest to that.  And I'm really good at it, I'm actually, horribly, proud of it.  But I'm not at all that way around Jorge, actually I think because of medical crap (WHICH I'M SO FUCKING TIRED OF) I'm not sexual at all.  I need to get all that fixed, its only getting worse and worse.  

I miss Sean.  I miss my best friend, the person I can confide everything to.  He's such a good listener and I love listening to him.  And I love his smile and the way he makes me smile and how awkward he can be at times and so confident at other things.  He's one of the greatest guys I know.  NOW, don't get confused Sean and I have never been like ""that.""  Honestly, he's the brother I never had and I'm gunna go tell him that.  <3"

"event","It's weird what Christmas can do to people. I'm not for big holiday because they cause too much stress and anxiety (that's why the 4th of July is my favorite) but still you can't escape them. This year is different for me. I kinda want to do Christmas right and it had so much potential. Only the best parts were gunna happen. Jorge and I set up the tree alone on my birthday but that didn't happen because an awful exam. And visiting my parents whenever we had time just for presents and general merriment. Plus I really miss my dad, a lot more than I've been letting on. Even the thought of him so far away and during all this makes me emotional. Which brings me to the next mess up. My grandma. I feel so bad that my dads holiday is going to be ruined by this. I mean we still haven't had a funeral and he hasn't gone through her things. So much painful stuff for him to do. I wish it could all just be over and he could move on and be happy because if there's one man on the face of the planet that deserves peace I would say it's him. And there's been so much stress added with jorges parents coming up. I know in the long run it'll be so nice for all them to be together and do their traditions but up until then I'm just like OMG the stuff I need to get done. I even find myself planning how to relax which to me is counter productive. Idk I just can't wait for a calm holiday."

"event","<font face=""blackadder ITC"" color=""#009900"" size=""7"">Ariel</font>  This morning my happy kitty was put to sleep.  It was a very sad affair.  She was my last cat.  Her health has been failing for a while but I mean she was always so sturdy and just carried on.  Earlier this week she had a bad episode but we took her to the vet and it looked like she was going to be ok.  But I guess last night, who knows how long really, she slept in her litter box because she couldn't get up.  Can you imagine that?  Spending a whole night, possibly, in your own feces and piss because your body isn't responding to your will?  I mean that kinda sounds like a disgusting form of torture.  And she had thrown up a ton all over the kitchen, like a human amount or more.  And there was poop all over the place.  I mean her bones were brittle and she had really bad arthitis but she was enduring.  I don't know what changed in one night.  It wasn't that she gave up either, because she fight until the end.  I can't imagine being such a sharp and smart cat, trapped in a body that is no longer working and knowing I'm going to my death.  But while her body was ready for it, she wasn't.  I wasn't there, I just couldn't be but my mom told me she had to be sedated first because she was fisty until the end.  

Did I make the right choice?  I mean it was my choice in the end, my mom would have respected what I said, if I said no...Did I just make the easy choice?  Because I'm moving, my parents are moving, we didn't know what to do with her because she was old and getting into a bad shape.  Did I just go along with this....because it was easier.  Because easy doesn't always mean simple, and this is anything but simple.  I have to tell myself I made the right decision.  I mean she had no quality of life.  But was it something we could have fixed?  Was this the ONLY way?  I should have gone.  Just to see what the vet said, to fight for her, for her life, maybe she'd be....I don't know.  Did my mom just want her gone?  My mom wasn't fond of having a cat, she's a dog person.  

I miss my cat.  It's not even a full day later and I'm being dumb.  I found her secret sock full of catnip in the closet where she used to sleep.  There's the half eating can of tuna cat food in the fridge that was her favorite.  I have expect her to come running (as well as she could) into my room and see what I'm doing.  The kitty door into the laundry room is useless now.  Maybe its good I'm moving?  

I don't know if I believe that animals go to heaven.  I want to so badly.  I used to think that animals didn't have souls, that they were just here to serve humans and God didn't create them with a higher ""purpose"" like he did humans.  Their only purpose is to serve humans.  So when they died, nothing special happened, no heaven, no hell, just dush, ash and dirt.  I don't want to believe that anymore.  I want to believe that Jasmine and Ariel are in a nice place now, with no sickness or bad things.  Even if I don't get to see them again, even if Cat Heaven and Human Heaven never mix, I wanna know they are there, in paradise.

I'm even more lonely now without my cats.  I don't have friends in Merritt Island anymore but (as lame as this sounds) I used to talk to my cat.  Wow, that sounds even worse when I admitt it.  But its sad but true, and she used to meow back at me like she understood, possibly even more than I did, all my worries and woes.    I hate typing in the past tense, its the worst tense, shortly followed by the conditional future.  

I did the right thing.  I did the right thing.  I did the right thing....maybe if I just say it over and over I'll believe it?  Please God?  I've never been good at guilt and sorrow."

"event","When all you know from life is bad things its hard to just sit and enjoy the good things.  Bad things stir up so many wripples and cause so much choas and emotion and business that you feel constantly challenged and tired and worked up that its hard to just sit in stillness and enjoy happiness. Happiness isn't always a strong emotion that grips you and overwhelms you, sometimes its just the lack of bad things that makes up happiness and true contentness.  So between my grandmother dying, my other grandma getting and fighting cancer, having lupus and my dad losing his job and lots of drinking its hard to just enjoy life and all the good things I have.  When nothing bad is happening life seems to be at a stand still, seems to be boring.  But that's just an illusion, its not boring, its how its meant to be.  To me having a life that doesn't make a thrilling tale is a happy life.  All great stories have some big trial or sadness that the protagonist has to overcome in order to have their ""happily ever after."" Why can't we just have the ""happily ever after""?  It would make for a far less interesting story but I'm ok with that because true life isn't a fairy tale.  I just want to live forever with Jorge and be boring if that means nothing trageic is happening.  And I think once we get over this middle portion of our lives, this in between time, life will be more interesting.  We'll have our actual lives instead of this time where we're building our lives.  We just need to endure a little more of this stagnate period and life will pick up.  I'm sure of it.  Look at me for once being optimistic instead of nihilistic."

I've been holding onto the idea that I'm Abigail's best friend but idk in high school we were just thrust on each other, always together we didn't plan it, it just happens and so the consequence was a close friendship.  But now we never see each other or talk and I know she has a lot of good new friends at UF so I think its kinda naive of me to think I'm still her best friend.  That being the case I hate that my friendship with people doesn't have that level.  Like idk if anyone misses me when they're gone, I mean besides my boyfriend.  We always miss each other :)  I mean just friends :(  I've been trying to make new friends.  But I think the more I talk to Sean the less he likes me, ironically.  Idk it was just inspired by me creeping facebook like I said."

"event","As she stood on the balcony feeling the salty breeze on her cracked lips she saw the amber embers of a cigarette tip through the dim dying rays of dusk.  The wisp of smoke flowed from a faceless man hiding in the shadows.  He exhaled one last time with a long sigh then smothered the stub filter in his stained ashtray.  He moved into the artifical light of his balcony lamp where she could see he was shirtless, shoeless and still in his board shorts.  Christina brooded over his appearance bitterly.  She envied his position in life.  It was so clear to her that he had reached his happy ending, that his minimalist beachy life style was precisely where he wanted to be.  Christina, on the other hand, was miles away from where she wanted to be.  At that exact moment in life she was in his dream, footsteps from the beach, and she doesn't even know where she belongs.

Ugh.  Sometimes being wise is so hard.  I know I'm doing the smart thing, getting my degree fast and as cheaply as possible, then getting more school and a better job, all the while saving as much as possible to have a great first place.  Its just really hard because I can be where I want to right now or do what i want."

I don't like to speak of angels and demons but I believe demons dwell and thrive in the dark of night and well angels flourish in the fresh rays of dawn.  I find I think not-so-great-things at night.  It doesnt help that I just watched the Virigin Suicides, maybe this is why i read at night, to direct my thoughts to the positive.  The only reason Im up is because Im supposed to do homework....its due in 7 hours.  But yeah I cut two small cuts into my lower back about a week ago.  No jumping to conclusions it wasnt for the normal reason I cut myself.  I have a scar from a cyst and it was hurting and itching so I was worried it was coming back, so I cut to see if there was cystic fluid or blood.  There was blood, and I cut no deeper.  But yeah idk up until now I got in my mind that it would be so hard to break my skin, like my skin was iron and nothing could break it.  Mind you for some odd reason thats only for me, I totally expect outside forces to be able to break my skin.  Besides the point, the point is that I found out how easy it is to break my skin.  And ugh there was such a satisfying feeling to it.  Not the same feeling I used to have, frenzied euphoria, its the same satisfying feeling of peeing.  

LOL, its probably not helping me to write this down.  I should just do my homework and go to bed.  

PS No worries I'm not falling back into old habits, its just something something evil planted in my brain to dwell on and I'm aware of that.

Like viewing fireworks along the night skyscape of NYC or the sun rising in peru, the mist on the hills in australia.  England, China, Czech, Italy, Spain, France, Hawaii, and countless other places.  And I'm stuck at home going to school and working at Macy's.  I hate it.  I don't have a college experience because I'm living at home 50 miles from school.  So I feel lazy like I'm not doing anything with my life because I work at a department store in the mall and I sit at home doing my online classes and playing games online.  I want to be travelling the world, or at least living on my own, even if it is only a dorm.  I feel like Im in a rut, which I know isnt true because after this semester and next I'll have a 4 year degree, already!  I can get a <i>career</I> with a salary not hourly wage.  Maybe move out, hopefully with Jorge, that also depends on his schoolling.  

I just want to start my life.  On my own, dependent of my parents I mean.  I wast ever expecting to live here this long.  I'll be 21 soon and I still live at home.  I know thats acceptable in this economy but Im normally good at working things out, or lucky enough.  

What I want.  I want a career that I love, that is always pushing me, where I'm constantly learning things.  I want privacy, security and comfort.  I want to be able to do what I want with Jorge when I want, like cute things that normal young couples get to do.  Sleep together, cook together, watch tv and cuddle together, and all those other things.

The government just feels like punishing me.  ""Oh Christina, you worked harder and earned more money this year?  AWESOME!  Now you can give us more, instead of us helping you for not doing too much.  You worked hard in school and got a scholarship?  Then worked hard to pay part of your tuition anyways?  AWESOME! We can heavily tax the money you get back from your scholarship.  So much that you now owe us money!""  What is wrong with our country?

Its just we're magnificent in person.  Our relationship is awesome, its better than anyone elses I know.  We're so good at talking and spending time with each other.  And everytime we see each other we get better and better at it.  We wouldn't have any of these issues if it was a normal relationship.  (Or if I wasn't tired and sad about my cat already.)  I'm just so ready for out lives to start.  I hate this transition period.  I want my degree.  I want to move out.  I want a career.  I want to be with him forever.  I don't want us to ""play"" house, I want us to live it.  We're so cute together, we're so good at helping each other.  It isn't a one sided relationship.  I try to do all I can for him whenever he wants it because he does so much for me and spoils me that its the LEAST I can do.  

I love how he holds me when we talk.  I love how he wakes me up in the morning and carries me out of bed.  I love how he tucks me in.  I love when he kisses my nosey because I have morning breath but he just wants to kiss me.  I love what he thinks intimacy is.  I love how unselfish he is.  I love how he can play with me, how he is the right amount of delicate, with pillow fights and such.  I love his cute little snores and when Im sitting next to him when hes asleep and he grabs for me like Im his teddy bear.  :)

"event","So basically I've got it all backwards.  When I need to talk and be social, I'm shy and quiet and when I just need to shut up, I blurt everything out and end up feeling bad.  I can't sleep when I feel bad.  Like seriously I can't <lj-cut text=""mer""> it makes me feel how I used to feel this past year, aka miserably pathetic and hopeless.</lj-cut>  Things this past year DON'T matter and I've been sooo good with getting over everything and moving on and not letting anything get brought up and surfacing.  And its not even that I'm surpressing it, it just sincerely doesn't matter.  He liked her, maybe he loved her.  They were intimate.  It happened.  Its fair, Ive been with other guys, I don't even want to imply that I think its not fair in any sense.  I don't know I just want to think of their relationship as Justin and I's.  (WARNING: THE TRUTH and lame comparison)  Justin was my Jacob.  While Jorge (Edward) wasn't around Jacob kinda feeling the space, never quite being good enough but being better than nothing.  He loved her and would love to be with her forever but she loved Edward.  I just thought it was like that for Jorge.  That it wasn't too serious, he wasn't too attached, that it was a rebound or even just a normal high school relationship.  But she hurt him.  He really really cared about her.  I'm not hurt at all by Justin and I's break up, if anything I'm relieved.  

And the reason I'm kinda mean to Justin nowadays is because I don't know how he bewitched me or influenced me away from Jorge in the first place.  None of this would have happened if he hadn't seduced me in my vulnerable lonely state.  Ugh oh how I would love to just be the victim but we all know I'm guilty.  And honestly it kills me.  

I try so hard to be chill, to be neutral, or just happy because I'm not good with other emotions.  Anger, guilt, depression, despair, sorrow.  I suck at those because I want to tear my skin open or drink them away or not eat and disappear with my problems.  I couldn't cut myself, sometimes I wish I could, because idk part of me thinks it was easier.  Its so much easier to have something physical to fight, to focus on, one thing to feel.  Drinking I could easily do but I don't want to.  I want to be mature and responsible.  I like the taste of certain alcohol and I want to be able to enjoy it with Jorge and not worry about limits.  And not eating...sigh...I feel like thats the least controllable.  Like I can't force myself to be hungry.  My appetite is linked with my emotions.  When I'm happy, I eat normal.  When I'm unhappy, I don't eat.  Extreme but ugh I'm a horribly hypocritically extreme person.  

This is probably one of those bad timing things.  Where I should just shut up."

"event","So I decided I couldn't let that last post be my most recent.  Because well that's unlike me, or the me I want to be/ see myself as.  So I made a plan.  I'm going to a run a mile at least every other day (it was going to be everyday but I have awful shin splints and didn't do it today.)  I started yesterday.  Also, I'm going to get more.  And sleep more.  Like I'm so dedicated that I have a notebook dedicated to it.  I wrote down my average weight (123, eek!!) BMI: 19.3 (nearly underweight 18.5 is underweight.)  I'm going to write down my mile times and when I get to like a 7:30 mile (like I used to do no sweat) I'll work on two miles in 16 minutes then 3 miles in 21 minutes (I've done it in 20 before.)  And eating, ugh the hardest part.  I'm going to make sure I eat more and eat more of things I need.  I eat pretty healthy but I only eat fruits and vegetables.  I need to have protein (meat, beans) at least once a day.  I beat my zinc and iron levels are so low.  What I am NOT doing is counting calories, not because this is a diet, lol, because its not.  I'm making sure I eat more not less.  But rather I'm not counting because that is behavor or an anorexic and well no risks.  I plan on just being physically healthier and therefore physically healthier which will keep me mentally happy.  

I need to take control of my life instead of just dealing or living.  I'm tired of being too weak to do simply tasks, like pick myself up off the ground with mostly arms.  I'm tired of being cold and shaking all the time because I don't have enough of the right kind of sugar.  I'm tired of everyone getting on my case about my skinniness.  (My mom is making me go to the doctors because I've lost so much weight so fast, she thinks I have cancer, so typical.)

Ugh Justin explained it like this and of course I don't want to believe him.  He said that its not that I'm not hungry, its that I've learned to ignore it or just have it 24/7.  Its a form of suffering and I've never really gotten over my self-injury tendencies so I like hurting in some manner.  This is just my new way of cutting....apparently.  And I want to prove that wrong.  I am not bound by my past.  Its called the past for a reason and its going to stay there.  I have no ghosts haunting me, my skin may not be markfree but my slate is.  

I want to live up to my potential.  I want to get a degree is in a dying field.  I want to revive it!  I want to cause a movement!  A reawakening even to language!  I want people to feel my passion and let it inspire them.  I don't understand why its dying, the world is moving to become more beautiful.  Art is more popular than ever in all forms, plastic surgery is on the rise, even music has more variations than 10 years ago.  But language is an ignored art, one taken for granted.  No one stops to appreciate the subtle beauty of a word anymore unless its accompanied by a melody.  Words are our everthing, they are how we express love, hate, sadness, everwhat emotion our body is possessed by.  They show our heritage by which language we speak.  They shouw our history by how the word changes.  They are even so specific that they show where we are from, our social status and our education through dialect.  And that's just using them!  Dont get me started on how we acquire language.  Because its not learnt.  Sure you can teach babies some things so they acquire it faster but if no one taught children speech they would still acquire it.  Its soo fastinating.  Its something inheirent in us.  There's even a universal grammar that seems to be almost biological!  And yet the whole thing is arbitary, lol how ironic and amazing and mercurial! 

I don't know how this turned into a post about language but yeah...deal, lol."

"event","This is when it definitely sucks not having friends.  None at all.  My last friend is no longer my friend, but I'd give anything to have someone to talk to right now.  I hate being all alone.  I can't believe I held in the tears this long.  My pretty makeup...ruined.  I didn't mean for it to end this way.  Jorge and I are not happy right now.  Or else I would be talking to him.  I just keep letting him down and it makes me so worried.  I feel pathetic and desperate.  That I'm so worried about him leaving me.  He says I need to support him more, be more cheering and he's right.  I freak out so much and so easily now.  I'm stressed and he doesn't know it.  Because yet again I feel lame.  I'm stressed because I don't want him to leave me, but that's my downfall.  When I'm not stressed, like those rare occasions I'm really happy (like last night or in person) we're perfect.  But idk I'm soo stressed.  And its not all him.  I mean I'm worried my parents are going to kid me out at any moment.  And I don't understand why.  They say I'm a horrible daughter and I mean yeah I talk back but I've been working on that, its easier on all of us if I just shut my mouth.  But I do all my chores and everything they ask.  And I'm the good daughter, Crystal is the slutty drop out bum daughter.  Eh I guess I can't call her slutty I bet my mom thinks I'm worse in that area than my sister.  But I can't afford to get kicked out.  It would literally ruin me.  I wouldn't be able to go to school, therefore no future.  And I don't know why I'm stressed about this, but classes.  I guess its because I don't have a good feel for them but they're stressing me out.  I'm not sure what to expect from them, how hard they'll be and such.  I'm worried I'm going to lose my job.  Not lose because its seasonal but I'm worried they won't ask me to stay.  And it was soo hard to get a job the first time it could take months to get another one.  Which leads to money.  I have barely any.  Don't tell anyone but I'm not buying books this semester, because I can't afford it.  I'm trying not to be an emo kid and be like ""woe is me"" because life could be worse, life has been worse.  But I rely on myself so much nowadays and it really hurts to admitt this but I'm letting myself down and there's no one else to pick me up, no safety net, this is the real world.  If I fail this I fail life.  It is life.  I'm soo stressed.  I can't eat and I can't sleep.  (I bought an extra small bathing suit yesterday, extra small, that's not healthy.  Just another stress.)  I want to start running, miles and stuff so I have more stamina and maybe can sleep at usual hours.  But I can't do that if I can't eat and have the energy to run.  And I can't force my mouth to down food when it needs to.   Its hard for me to make new friends because well I have a long past and I wear it on my wrist.  People get the wrong idea about me all the time and its easier just to alienate myself than to deal with the questions.  Because it comes up, it always comes up.  I regret that part of my life soooo much, who knew it would cause me troubles years after it ended.  I'm trying hard to be a responsible healthy adult but its so hard sometimes.  I don't have it together at all.  I'm a mess.  God where are you?"

"event","So yeah its ridiculous but I feel sooo old.  Like there's noticeable differences between how my body reacts now and from when I was younger.  And I don't mean younger when I was 19, 20 days ago, I mean younger like years.  Its just at 20 thats a quatifible difference and therefore causing my nostalgic mood.  For example, bones crack now that I feel shouldn't, like knee caps.  Also my back is never quite right, and last year I strained it and couldn't stand up straight for several days.  And I have a wrinkle on my forehead, it goes away if Im completely relaxed but thats hardly ever.

I know Jorge says I'm aging like a fine wine, getting better with age and all that jazz.  And I believe him, I don't mean that in a conceided way.  I was never fat but I've definitely become more defined over the years, the roundness has disappeared pleasantly.  But thats just the thing, looks dont mean much to me, how I feel does.  And I feel old.  It could just be that I'm sitting at home all the time, not doing anything, which is typical behavior of the elderly, that is making me feel older."

And honestly I wish it could have worked out, I just want it to work out with someone eventually.  I hate bouncing around from happiness to happiness, guy to guy, experience to experience.  I really just want stability.  And sustainable happiness.  But I think this was the best move, obviously I did the act.  I was worried I'd regret it and miss him too much.  Don't get me wrong I miss him but the pros out weigh the cons here.  I'm just ready to be with someone I can love with a burning passion.  So yeah I'm sad but I'm trying to see it has half full.-->"

"event","So let me tell you about my day, or week, or year.  So today, I woke up at 11:30 because Justin called.  You see he thought I missed my first class but I didn't because I don't have spanish this week because I have an interview for that class thursday but we'll  get there.  So got ready, drove to 7-11.  Was really sad that gas rose to 2.39, only got 5 dollars and a super huge 44oz soda, like everyday for my addiction.  Drove to school, got a good parking spot on the first floor closest to my class.  Was a little bit early to class but I know a couple of people in there now so I talked to this girl Krista.  Class started my group from the oral presentation asked what my grade for it was.  Krista got a 94, Daniel got an 88 so I checked mine on Daniel's computer, I also got an 88.  Which I didn't understand because I wrote the whole thing.  We went over the review for the midterm which is on thursday.  Krista and Daniel asked me to help them study so I'm doing that tomorrow after class.  I mildly got into the Italian Jeopardy, my team lost by 10 points but whatever.  Talked to the teacher after class about my oral presentation grade, she said she was disappointed in me.  I always talk so fluid in class but my presentation wasn't.  She said I'm the best in the class but she was disappointed.  That kinda hurt.  I mean I've been working so hard on school this semester, I think everything I do currently deserves an A but whatever.  So I drove home mildly upset.  Came home, had to feed the animals because no one else does, my lazy sister...Tried to relax but I don't know how to do that.  I started laundry because I'm tired of my room being a mess.  Watched a lot of bones, went to the computer when Jorge asked me to, hoping he'd want to talk.  But we were kinda quiet, i misinterpreted his silence for being upset.  I was hesitant to believe a photograph he sent me wasn't a lie but it doesn't matter.  It just went downhill from there.  I don't know what happened.  I'm just sooo stressed and I feel so unappreciated everywhere.  I'm worried I'm becoming depressed again.  I feel like I'm a nameless face in a crowd again.  I feel like people are just walking by me.  I feellike no one cares.  I hate feeling this way but it could just be because its late and I'm tired.  I've been trying to control myself.  I feel like people are tossing aside my problems because they aren't severe.  Sure I'm not cutting myself, I'm not suicial or completely anorexic but this stress and school crap is new to me.  I've never done school properly.  I just need someone to listen.  Balance.  
So crap for the week.  Tomorrow I have to tutor people and study myself and have an interview with Macy's and find time to go to the library to work on my research project.  Thursday I have my Italian Midterm and my 5 minutes in hell Spanish interview.  Friday I have computer science homework due and I'll have to be really careful with that, the teacher sucks at grading.  Sunday my Linguistic homework is due and my research paper is due.  Its a crazy week.  Once this week is over I'm sure I'll be ok.  One more week.
And that girl Alexia that cut herself in the bathroom at camp a couple years ago that I've been helping and keeping in touch with.  Totally rejected me and threw me out of her life.  :("

But here's the problem, I've gotten older, more time has passed.  I don't have time to do anything else with my life.  What have I done, what am I doing?  Going to a 4-year university to be a Linguistic Anthropologist.  Doesn't that sound fun and exciting?  No.  I remember when I used to dream, used to think I could do great things, be remembered, make history.  What happened to those dreams, why don't I have dreams for my life?  Why can't they come true?  When did my dreams die.  I mean slowly I guess I noticed they went away.  No more ambassador, no more Yale, no more greatness.  But why didn't more replace them.  I want my life to be an adventure, a story to tell my grandkids and right now its dull.  The future looks dull.

Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;

No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; 
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more. 
Then if for my love thou my love receivest, 
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest; 
But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest 
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest. 
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief, 
Although thou steal thee all my poverty; 
And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief 
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury. 
Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, 
Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.

I'm already thinking about professional careers, where I might have to move for my job, what would be best for my finacial security.  Like purchasing a car now while I don't have many bills and could pay it off quickly, so when I get settled someplace I can buy a house.  A HOUSE.  Yeah I'm thinking that far ahead.  And even further, like marriage.  Ugh!  People I date now are potential husbands, scary!

Anyways, that wasn't intended to be in this post but I briefly got overwhelmed please excuse me.  So what I was going to talk about is sentimenal stuff.  I'm very resentful towards camp because it was my haven and home and after this last summer I hate it and never want to return.  And it just makes me want to cry.  I feel like it betrayed me.  Everything was awful.  I couldn't wait to come home, isn't that so strange?  But now that I'm home I'm bored all the time, at least I was never bored at camp, and I had lots of friends, and laughs and good times.  And I really miss Meghan Brown, we didn't hang much or talk much but when we did it was always very nice and memorable.  There's a lot of people and things I'll miss but there's equal I won't miss.  Its bittersweet.  Maybe one day I'll return."

<lj-cut text=""My lyrics"">
As lame as it is, I kinda relate to that song now that i've actually been listening to the words.  And now that my Romeo has kinda come back to me I think its hard for him to express liking me despite everything that's transpired.  Its much easier for him to express lust than love and don't get me wrong we always expressed lust but there's no affection other than simple bodily gratification.  There's always been more to us than that and I'm not feeling it now.  I don't want to move forward without it and this just lust thing feels different.  Its the wrong step forward, love then lust but a step forward is still a step forward so I'm not making a fuss.  I just don't want to be only lusted after, I want to be loved again.  I could let myself love him as I did before, right now I'm controlling it, rationing it, I don't want to let it all out just to have it denied and end up hurt again.  I don't think I could endure that pain twice.  I know he's equally worried about getting hurt but he's not setting it up right.  He's setting it up for me to cheat on Justin, and that's not right, that doesn't make me any better of a person and doesn't convince him that I won't do that to him again.  I don't want to cheat on anyone.  We kinda burnt all bridges.  His family doesn't like me, my family doesn't like him, his friends don't like me, my friends don't like him.  It would be hard to get back together, but its even harder not being with him.  I don't know what to do.  And now he's not coming to camp.  I don't want to drift even further away from him, I'm trying not to but I don't know if he's trying.  I hope he is.  I wish he could let his guard down around me, I wish he wasn't so harsh with me, he doesn't have to be, he can be soft and cute and romantic like he was.  And I want to be taken care of again, I want to be his squeaky toy, I was to be held in his strong arms, I want to be protected by his strong arms.  I want everything as it was.  I believe it could be...eventually.

Internation paradises are better.  A big but comfortable city to get lost in and meet new people.  That's what I want.  London, Paris, Florence, Rome, I'd take any of them.  Just slip away, Paris I think is ideal, I'm not too familar with the language so I could just get lost in translation, just listen to the melody of the language on the street.  Not process it and translate it.  Just the thought of jumping on a plane and flying away it sounds so appealing.  Being free, having nothing tying me down, I'd love that for a week.  Sometimes I wonder how did I get here?  So wrapped up with guys?  Remember when I was single and didn't mind?  It wasn't too great at the time but it wasn't bad.  I think I'd like that choice again.  But please don't misinterpret me, I'm not running away because everything's horrible and I don't dislike any of you and that's why I want to be single.  I'm just reminiscing."

"event","So yeah definitely its safe to say that this has been the hardest year of my life.  Which may be hard for some of you readers to believe seeing as all the crap I went through but its true.  I mean most of it was because of Jorge.  You know the initial freak out.  Then the rollarcoaster, fighting my feelings for him, then just being jilted which was way worse this time than last time.  Even now things are so much better, I was so unhappy not talking to him, I was making myself anorexic and not sleeping, but still things are off.  I can't expect them to jump to some form of normal, its been like a year.  
Anyways this is about the past year.  Losing Jorge and then having no friends was super hard.  And it felt like I was rejected by everyone at school.  I still don't understand why I haven't made friends, and it makes me clingy, and desperate to hang out with high school friends.  And therefore hurt when they don't feel the same.  So yeah for the most part I felt all alone and Justin helped, he was someone to talk to, but at the same time, as most people know, it was that beginning relationship stage.  Where he learns all about me and my habits and I guess because I was with Jorge so long I was impatient because Jorge knows everything like I expect him to know what the sounds I make mean and sometimes he still doesn't so....yeah.  But he's a comfort to me, a constant, when everything else in my world is changing.
So yeah no friends, emotional wreck, and although hired part time I was working full time and managing.  Phew!  I'm officially known as that candy girl, I get it all the time.
So besides pouring myself into work I actually poured myself into schoolwork.  I did all my homework.  I studied 8 and 1/2 hours for my math final and got an 86.6, hey lets check my final grades.....
Antho-B
Italian-A
Comp Sci-Still don't know
Math-Still don't know

The point of all this is, I'm proud of myself.  I did it all.  I know its not all over now that its summer.  And actually I don't know where to go from here but even so I don't feel as overwhelmed and freaked like I normally do because well I endured ALL this it really can only get easier.  And I feel more in control of my life, its my decisions, my fate, its not up to someone else's actions or opinions, as I let it be before.  And I'm confident in how I feel, lol for now...

This year lasted so long and so much happened but when I look back it doesn't feel like a lot.  I mean it all feels like yesterday that this drama happened and I was hurt.  I feel much more mature.  Like I've felt horrible pain before when younger obviously, but I couldn't contain it so yeah resorted to certain measures but I feel it differently now.  Not any better, its not somehow less painful, but I can process it better, sort through it better, not necessarily move on faster, but not hurt myself.  Maybe I am cured?  :)"

"event","Dear Lord,
<s>
Why do I still feel this way?  Why is this emotion still present in my heart?  Why can't I sleep at night?  Why do I barely eat?  Not to criticise but its getting ridiculious, I'm withering away.  Did I do something wrong?  Do I deserve this punishment?  You don't understand how much I just want to sleep.  I haven't slept more than 3 hours at night for months.  And today for example I ate maybe a half of a chicken wrap, and an apple.</s>
Help.

~Me"

"event","I'm so tired of being the responsible adult.  I hate it.  I hate being mature.  I hate taking the high road.  I just want to misbehave.  I want to act badly.  I want to have some sort of sinful fun.  It isn't fair I hear all these wonderful stories of college experience.  And you would have thought I'd have stories to tell right?  From who I was in high school you'd think I'd go crazy.  Nope.  I have a 40 hour a week job.  I do my all my homework.  I attend important classes.  I'm that dorky student who wears a backpack, doesn't stop too talk to anyone, just goes to and from class and doesn't have any fun.  It sucks.  I can't even curse.  Mer!"

"event","well, i'm really excited now because the kid i met this summer at camp thats from texas... is coming to charlotte in either march or april.  so hopefully i'll get to see him.  

valentines day is coming up again, only the most worthless holiday in the entire calendar.  at least we get out of school for like presidents day and stuff but valentines day - no - plus its really depressing if you're single, which somehow always seems to happen to me.  whaddaya know?!  anyway... its ok cause i really think that sending carnations to people is a good idea... cause i like making my friends' days.  so hoorah.  except theyre $1.50... i don't get that.  they'd sell a lot more for just a dollar.

i finally got to see ward this weekend!  but we didnt get to play scrabble... sad sad.

"event","yea, i know everyone knows what happened.  but i just figured i'd write it down on this little thingy... cause yea.  anyway, we had a drug bust at all the schools today and 49 ppl were arrested including JamesOn Curry which my dad doesnt find too funny but im just like hey, he just fucked up his career.  what a dumbass.  i also find it funny that there are still drug dealers at our school that they didnt catch.  so its a little bit pointless... and the fact that they had an undercover cop at our school for 5 months... seems a little extravagant but whatever.  anyway...

i went with ryan van fleet to kmart today and i made him buy axe deodorant spray because its really hot... and i got some peanut M&Ms... and then we went by timmys house cause ive been really mean to him lately so we wrote POOP and POO and DOODIE and stuff on pieces of paper with pictures and notes about how i love him and stuff... then ryan called his house and asked for timmy and was like ""looooook at your caaaaaaaaaar!"" in an evil voice.  and we call back again and his mom is like ""TIMMMMMY!!!!!"" and hes like ""mom, someone is making fun of me"" and shes like ""who is theeeeeees?"" and ryan says ""todd"" and shes like ""TIMMYYY ITS TAAAAAAAAD!""  and timmys mom had to make him pick up the phone.  so i get home and timmy's all like ""tell ryan not to fucking call me as a prank anymore my mom almost called the cops cause she thought some murderer was going to kill me when i went out to look at my car"" and timmy was like if you effed up my car ill kill you; he was being mean about it so ryan and i were like dude, go look at your car, it will make your day.  so he admitted he was being a dork... and its all good now.  that was my day.  no school for me tomorrow either... woot..."

"event","you know what?  coach wells is a piece of shit.  my day sucked.  you wanna know why?  ok, so i was planning on going to allcounty after school from 3:30-5, then having time to eat dinner and do a little homework and then go to Italy rehearsal from 7-9.  yea.  so coach wells comes up to me at lunch and is like ""hey, we have practice from 530-7 every day this week.  and my schedule (see previous post) is not going to in any way allow me to attend practices this week befire regionals.  so i told him that.  and he got pissy with me in front of everyone at my lunch table and was like ""youre telling me that you cant sacrifice your other things for swimming"" and i was like no cause its for a damn grade you dumbass.  and he was like ""well, ive talked to mrs sam and she said that musical rehearsals could be missed if needed..."" and i was like dumbass coach wells... ""i'm not going to musical rehearsals this week because they overlap the allcounty stuff which is FOR A GRADE... and he goes ""so youre telling me that swimming isnt important to you"" and i said ""no, im telling you i cant miss these things"" and katie griggs was like seriously wells, she cant miss them, shes telling the truth... and he puts his hand on the back of her head and goes ""i dont want you in this conversation: get out"" and i was like you rude-ass mother-effer.  what is your damn problem?!?!  so hes like ""anyway, i was considering putting you in the relays in addition to your two events but im not anymore"" so im like ok.  thats fine.  whatever.  take me out of the relays, its ok. so he walked of in a hissy and i was damn pissed.  well... i worry about it all day and decide that im going to go to allcounty after school from 330-5, run home, get changed, go to swimming from 530-7, go to italy rehearsal from 7-9, come home, eat, and then start homework.  which is REALLY hard on me.  well... he comes in my 7th period class and takes me out in the hall and is like ""youve put me in a bad situation so ive decided to take you out of regionals.""  and im like WTF... so i explained to him what i was going to do today... and hes like i dont care, im taking you out because i think that you cant handle everything you have and you cant make sacrifices for swimming so im going to swim other people in your place because i just dont think youre being fair.  and im like fuck whatever wells.  i understand.  and i was like ""do you want me to come help on friday or what?""  and hes just like ""whatever""...

i hate him soooooo much... i wasnt too upset until it set in in 7th period so i started crying a little and shit and i was just reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally mad.  grrrrr... excuse me if my academics are more important than your damn swimming you stupid ass.  anyway sorry, i had a real bad day... im going to eat and then go to italy rehearsal.  yea.  love you all.

"event","today was kickass... i woke up to my phone ringing... face.  so face came over and then after he left grayson called and well, lets just say we had a musical afternoon.  we decided we're going to get some songs going together and then set up a date to play somewhere... maybe towards the end of the school year when things quiet down a bit and we actually have time to play.  i was introduced to radiohead today... and we listened to CSN, etc.  i also forced grayson to listen to the cover i have of john mayer singing Kid A by radiohead which is not all too bad... then i tried to fix myself coffee and the bag broke and all the grind spilled into my drink... so i made tea instead.  damn coffee bags.


i haven't seen ward in a while.  i'm looking forward to beating his ass in scrabble next time we duel.  on guard!  i think we should play a game of ""dirty scrabble.""  hell yes.


you know what i miss?  the beach.  i'll be there in 26 days.  but thats only for an afternoon.  then OSB competition (woot woot) where maybe we will win our much-deserved laptops this year.  i also miss ryan from texas.  he's coming to charlotte over spring break but i'll be in italy.  thats sad.  IM GOING TO WATCH THE SUPERBOWL NOW with RYAN VAN FLEET cause he is my HERO."

"event","timmy is my hero.  he makes me so happy... except when he's down on himself which he shouldnt be...

last night was fun... except i kinda messed up in the middle of the song and timmy's guitar was way out of tune... but the second time was cool... and it was a lot of fun.  i appreciate them letting me play with them.  cause they kick ass.  they'll be at beverage gallery the 14th of february.  go see them.

face also makes me happy... 

and jt cole... because we have a musical connection.

and grayson.  cause we can sing choral music in my car and not be at all ashamed.  damn straight.

farewell...for now.  i'm gone to listen to CSN.  suite judy blue eyes cause thats me and ward's song.  hes also my hero.  and i love him even though someday i will beat him at scrabble."

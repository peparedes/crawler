"event","<P>Day 5: Let me tell you a bit about my siblings. I have 9, well now 10 sisters. In order of age (I think) they're: Hester, Idalee, Desma, Wandalin, Trudy, Gayora, Buffy Hunter (this was when my family decided to buy a color tv), Helga, Dorcas, and the new baby Gur. My sisters are real hard to tell apart. They're awful close in age, nine months apart to be exact, and they all look pretty much the same. There's only one word to describe the way they look. And that word is male. They're fine sisters, er, more like fine brothers. I'm after Helga and before Dorcas and Gur. Between me and Dorcas, our only brother was born. Poppa says he'd make a mighty fine boy, if he weren't a girl. His name is Christofred, but he insists we call him Christy. His kinda obsessive about his hair...and nails...and lips. For awhile there, we weren't quite sure just what he was. Momma always wanted a real girl, she says. He dresses this side of femminine. The femminine side of femminine. Poppa's gonna send him into counceling. Hopin' it'll knock some sense into him.</P>"

"event","<P>Day 1: I've come to a bump in the road already: momma doesn't approve. But that isn't going to stop me. All the great leaders of the world had to start somewhere, even if they faced perilous opposition. My poppa will stand by me. He knows, He's been here before. Poppa named me you know. On the day I was born, he looked in my face and said ""Zephan Varvara, you are somethin' else."" And then my momma said ""Washi Eyod Barnabas Varvara, don't you dare make fun of the baby! It's not her fault she's ugly."" My poppa has always gone by the affectionate nickname of Barshi, and was not aware that his wife even knew all his middle names. </P>
<P>My momma married my poppa under one condition. And that condition was drunk. They moved from Las Vegas to Shillbrooks, New Hampshire. In case you're wondering where that is, it's someplace out in the middle of Louisiana. It has winters like Ecuador and summers like Antarctica. We have a farm, where we raise platypuses and kangaroo rats. My job is to milk the platypuses every mornin' at five AM. They don't like it much, and this is where I got my strong training in perilous opposition. Gotta go now, momma's havin' another baby. My nine&nbsp;sisters and one&nbsp;brother are already down in the pantry, also called the delivery room. They serve refreshments. Momma thinks it's handy, what with all the food around. Catchya later.</P>"

"event","<P>rebecca and i are going to record a fictional log, based on a true story, about someone who is trying to break a world record (including midevil times) for longest time between baths/showers. this may sound&nbsp;weird at first, but belive me it'll sound (/smell)&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;weirder later.</P>
<P>so here follows the tale of Zephan Varvara, the girl who dared to go against all odds, to go where no animal has ever gone before. not quite sure where that is, but it's nowhere i wanna be.</P>"

"event","so its been a real long time since i've updated my journal... i tried to do it before but it didn't work, do'h!

so whats happened over the last couple of months?! not too much out of the ordinary.

hmm, got beaten up ny 4 guys that wanted to mug me, but i managed to get away and they didn't get anything, mike 1 - muggers 0, but they did give me quite a few bruises on my head, mike 1 - muggers 1, so i guess its all even.

...so i guess that was a bit out of the ordinary! 

as for uni, i took a class were i study tolerance and this meant i had (yes HAD) to go on a trip to amsterdam, where i had to study the liberal laws of prostitution and drug taking... an eye opening experience. needless to say it was a very interesting class and hopefully i did very well on it?!

my other classes aren't as fun, but i'm getting through them bit by bit! 

i can't believe i'm going to be finished uni in may, scary thought! 

in the summer i'll be going to tanzania with my church from back home, which will be a great experience, but will mean i won't be coming to highroad : (

as for jobs, thinking bout working in a church for a year or two in newcastle which should be good, (if i get the job)

i've managed to keep a realively healthly social life amongst the hard work, although my last experience of me going out ended with me on the stage in the night club, only to have a friend pull down my trousers and boxers in front of everyone...hmm we all had a good laugh (but not too much though?!) 

well i think i've updated you all with the past present and foreable future...

xmas was good by the way... yep thats me done, hope your all well


love ya

"event","right i've finally got round to writing part two of my entry...

and thinking about its kind of hard cause i've been a bit boring lately...

i've got loads of work from uni, which is keeping me going... we've got a fieldtrip to amsterdam in a week, where we are going to investigate a tolerant city.. and those that know amsterdam, prostitution is legal and u can smoke weed in bars, and for my coursework i have to write a journal on my thoughts! class! 

i've been real sporty lately, getting in shape (might of said that before!)

i won't be heading back to camp next year unfortunately guys : ( so i'm really going miss u all. i wil infact be heading to africa which will be awesome though

what else, i got jumped by 4 guys last week. they wanted a fag (cigerette for u americas cause that sounds really dodgy) but i didn't have one, then they wanted 30pence (about 60cents) and i wouldn't give it to them on principal! so one hit me and i grabbed him but then his mates jumped me from behind and had fun using my head as a push bag, which was a surprise to me! but i managed to run away and jump in a car, i called the police but they didn't do anything! lucky they didn't steal anything though! 

so thats about it from you, you are all caught up in the life of mike, which as you can probably tell isn't exciting, but it will be tonight, cause i got a big party, yey

stay in touvh guys

i've just finished my last class today, at 8pm, that sucks... it was dark when i went to the class at 6pm, that sucks more... but there was a wee bit of sunshine earlier, which was nice.

i was just checking out peoples journals as haven't done this thing for awhile, it was making me well up a bit... missing you guys 'n' all

bradd i'm playing loads of squash right now your be proud. in fact i've just looked at my watch and i gotta play in 10 mins, so i've got to go

"event","hmmmmmmm, where do i start, what do i say??? nothing much cause i ain't been doing anything too extra ordinary!!!

i'm in newcastle now, the north of england, back at university... its quality up here. the first years are having there party week, which is exclusive for them, but i've snuck in the back door for every event... i could tell a few stories here, but i won't.

i did meet some americans from up north, they didn't like bush though (sorry sarah), but its ok cause i spat in there faces... i didn't really... or did i?

i looked after my little 15 month cousin the other day i was shocked to find out he couldn't use the toilet, i pointed at it and showed him how to use it, but the arrogant little kid still used his nappies! but lucky he only did a ""pee pee"" so not messy to clean up... but found it highly funny... little punk.

ok so by now you've all probably realised how bad i am at using email and well just the internet in general... so don't take it personally if i don't mail, its just i don't go on it much... but i am thinking of u all, your all very special to me ***insert mikes nice sentimental face here (although nobody has probably seen it, so just make it up....look nice?)

please let me know how your doing? i'll try and check your journals if i can work it out


much love mikey xxxxxxxxxxxxx"

"event","erm, i wanna write something interesting, but i'm too tired... i'm staying at erin's house tonight with vinny (i'm in Virginia, USA for those that don't know) working at camp highroad in the middle of no where, its cool! i'm having fun, meeting loadsa new people and all that rubbish...

we (well the americans) celebrated july 4th independence day (from us english... they were better with us), but it was a fun day, so far i've tried to deface the americans values... 
on camp training when creating fires, i found a pencil with the american flag on and burnt it... haha, it was funny how some americans got upset and threatened to burn the english flag... oh, i'm trembling, please don't! 
a partner in crime also painted over the american flag in the office and wrote 'France'... very well done Faz, it brought a tear to my eye. 
they replied by writing over the english flag 'Wales', but spelt it 'Whales', when we asked why they spelt it like this they said because it had a silent 'h'... again good job guys!
there are some other nationalities and we have got there flags too... South Africa to Colony, Australia to New Zealand (and vice-versa), and Germany to Russia..

so as you can image we have made lots of friends! 

on a more serious note i was nearly bitten by a copperhead snake... deadly (ish), well i nearly stepped on it and it turned to bite me luckily i jumped 10 feet in the air and screamed like a girl (only because i knew it would scare it off).
Anyway i got some friends not scared of snakes and we caught it and put it in the swimming pool, it was funny at the time (by the way no one was in the pool, i'm not that stupid)
then later that afternoon we caught some baby rackoons that mum had died and gave them to the vet and saved a baby bat too...so i'm not all that bad! 

i'm working with little kids next week so that will be interesting, hopefully they will be good for uncle mikey!

anyway really i am to tired to continue, so i may try and write something serious next time!!!!"

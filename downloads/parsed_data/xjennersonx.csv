I was going to go on myspace again like usual but this computer at work is having an issue with it at the moment. Ah well.

All moved in! Yay! Everything is unpacked except downstairs bathroom stuff. But that's only because we have nowhere to put anything.

Our last show went very well. I thought we sounded great. It's weird to be trying out drummers. No one is really standing out yet but hopefully we'll find someone soon. We just got booked for a show February 28th at Studio 7 with Ruxton Towers and some other awesome bands. We're also still booked for January 28th at Hansen's with The East End!

The housewarming party went very well. It was a lot of fun. Not a whole lot of people, but just enough of the cool ones.

There is NOTHING to do at work. I did one order today.. and stuffed and sealed some envelopes. Been on lunch for an hour.. I think we're all leaving soon because there is nothing to do it's rediculous. I wish it didn't take me so long to get home. Stupid bus.

It's really weird having Shaina be gone... and she's still going to be gone for like two weeks. I've gotten use to seeing her every day so having her not be around is VERY strange.

Our house is getting decorated quite quickly. Lots of quotes up on the walls, it's awesome. Comcast doesn't service our area though.. so we have to go with this company called Millennium who offers the same services but more movie channels for the same price. I'm excited about it.

Anyway..... I can't think of anything else to type about.. I think I'll be leaving here shortly. Woo.

peace out... or something.."

So here is my update, in short.

Shaina has been living in our apartment with us for the past couple weeks. We pretty much hang out every minute of every day, and I have found that I don't get tired of her. Ever. And that's good. I like having friends like that.

Work has been hectic and somewhat annoying but I still enjoy my job lots.

My car had some issues last week but my dad bought and installed a new alternator and it's fine again.

Band stuff is awkward (I don't wanna talk about it) but still going good. We are in the process of writing 2 new songs...one of which is fucking AMAZING and is going to be so awesome once it's finished. Our drummer Chris informed us the other night that he's going to move home in January and go back to school so he'll no longer be with us... and he's going to help us find a new drummer as well. Also, we have a free show tomorrow night at the Blue Moon Tavern in the U District. 21+ obviously, FREE! 8pmish. We go on second out of 3 bands. We also just got booked for a show on Saturday December 10 at Studio 7 playing with The Classic Crime, Ever We Fall, Lucky For Nothing, and Morning Call. All these bands are signed to major labels. This show should be an amazing opportunity for us.

Also, we have a hookup who does booking for Warped Tour and might get us a couple dates on next year's tour. And soon we may have airplay on a radio station in the NETHERLANDS. Amazing.

Today is Thanksgiving! Erin and I are at her parents house to pick up some things. We ate at my parents house and I am as stuffed as a turkey. I've practiced driving today. Drove to my parents house, and to Erin's parents from my parents. Soon will drive to Ballard to go to see RENT :)

What else... OH RIGHT we're moving this weekend. Paying first month's rent on Saturday.. and starting to move stuff into our HOUSE! I can't even believe it.

Please keep in mind that this recording does not at all do this song justice. You have to see it live to experience the awesomeness of it. I seriously am so in love with this song, and I can't even explain it. It's just.. powerful. So PLEASE go check it out.

And PLEASE come see us tomorrow. 4:30pm. $7 advance, $9 at the door. It's going to be an awesome show, we are all very pumped for it.


In other news, everything is still going great. Yesterday after work, Shaina and I were so tired that we took a 3 hour nap. She came over tonight after band practice before she headed up to Liz's and we made gingerbread cookies, and then her, Erin and I fell asleep for 3 hours. I wasn't even really tired but I was laying in between Shaina and Erin... I had my left arm around Erin and Shaina was pretty much clutching my right arm... so my only option was to lay there so they were both comfortable. Then I fell asleep. Go figure.

Man I am so excited about the show tomorrow, it's going to be AWESOME. After that, sleepover night! And then on Sunday we go pay our deposit for the house!!!! I think we might be signing the lease then too. Everything is working out quite well. Our new address will be 3716 14th Ave S, Seattle WA 98144! Yay yay yay!!!

I really need to head to bed now.... later!!"

Man they hurt my ears. And they re-used 3 of our old songs. I can't even explain how angry that makes me. I know that they wrote those songs, but they were Half Past Two songs. You don't do shit like that. Bastards.

Oh well at least my band is good. ;)"

Working with Shaina is great. I haven't had to ride a bus in over a week now! Plus I always have someone to talk to.

Sunday we went to look at a house. We filled out applications and paid the application fee... and today, we got the house! WE GOT A HOUSE!!! It's a rental house, obviously. It's $1095 a month for 3 bedrooms, 1 1/2 bath, full size washer and dryer, water, sewer and garbage included in the rent. $600 deposit, $100 per pet. AMAZING! December 1st, we will live there. It's in Beacon Hill... like at 14th and Spokane St. It's connected to another house, but you'd never know being inside of it. So finally Erin and I will be living with Shaina and Liz which will be so much more conveinient for all of us since we hang out all the time anyway :) Working with Shaina has also helped me realize that I don't get tired of her at all! We're totally BFFs. Hehe.

So we seriously need to start packing.. ASAP.

The band isn't playing in Portland anymore. Something happened with the booker and they went with Portland bands instead. Which kinda sucks, but it's okay. I was scared about how we'd do two nights in a row. But practice has been sounding really good lately. With the exception of my amp... which has a buzzing speaker :( And today I broke ANOTHER bass string. This is the third one in like 4 months. I changed all my strings and hopefully this won't happen again for a long time. I'm sad I wasted so much money on those Dean Markley strings that were supposed to last forever. Oh well. More importantly I need to figure out what's wrong with my amp. Luckily I have a 2 year warranty on the speakers.

Anyway so we are still playing on the 12th at Studio 7. Doors at 4 or 4:30. We play first. We have advance tickets available for $7. Or they are $9 day of show. But you should buy them from us because you love us like that :)

"event","Wow I sure haven't been writing lately... too preoccupied with other things I suppose. I've been a busy bee lately.

Thursday was our show at the J&M. It went really well aside from my amp sounding funny, and Joe's amp cord fucking up. And me messing up a few times. Other than that, it was real good. That Saturday we played at the A Lesson In Chaos Halloween house party. It was actually really cool. My Ron Burgundy Halloween costume didn't really turn out the way I had hoped... I think I looked more like a mix of Charlie Chaplin and Hitler, unfortunately. The main problem was the wig we bought didn't work out, so we dyed my hair... but we didn't have brown hair dye so we dyed it black. Ah well. We played really well. We didn't bring my amp since it's been rattling... so I got to play through ALC's 8x10 Ampeg bass amp. Freakin awesome that thing is.

After we played, Erin, Liz, Shaina and I drove to Liz's to get her toothbrush and L Word DVDs and then went to Walmart in our costumes. Shaina was a hot cowgirl, Erin was a bee. Liz was just hot :) We got some movies and then headed home for our weekly sleepover. 

Sunday we got up to go house hunting but ate at Old Country Buffet first. I accidentally bumped into Liz and knocked her plate out of her hand and she burned her finger really bad on the mashed potatoes. Poor Liz!!! After eating we tried to look at some houses but people don't like to call us back, so we didn't see ANYTHING! After that we went to Blockbuster and got Soul Survivors. We really only wanted to watch because of Eliza Dushku but that movie made no sense whatsoever!! Weird. Then we watched Coyote Ugly, 40 Days and 40 Nights, The Upside of Anger and the Ellen DeGeneres Here and Now special. Then we all went to sleep. Shaina woke up at 2am and quit her job at UPS. She also applied at my work that day. They are against hiring friends but they were desperate for people immediately.

Anyway, Shaina came over last night and we watched Sleepy Hollow. Well we watched parts of it. Fell asleep in the middle of it. After it was over she headed up to Liz's to spend the night. She got up early this morning and came to pick me up and we headed to work together for her first day! I got about 4 small orders done and aside from that just worked on the GameTime and Element orders that need to go out asap. Evelyn, another new girl Collin hired started today too, around 2pm. She seems really cool. And tomorrow a girl who works at Toys in Babeland is starting work. Amazing. Josh also hired the girl with tattoos on her neck to be our new sales rep and she is HOTT. She walked into the room and was like ""hey"" to Shaina and she was like oh my god. Seriously... it's too bad she's in her own office all day with no one to stare at her :)

After work Shaina dropped me off. I've been bored ever since I got home cuz Erin is working late and there is nothing to do really. Shaina will probably be heading over pretty soon though, at least for a couple hours. Then she might stay at Liz's again. And then come back to pick me up in the morning to head to work.

And there is my update for the past week!"

"event","Northern State again!

I got to the Croc before the girls did. I walked to Westlake and back, waited outside for a little bit, and then went in to order some food. Got a french dip. Delicious. The girls showed up right as I finished. Sprout was driving their van and waved as they parked. Spero was wearing her shirt. They came in and said hello. Sprout gave me a hug. I sat while they set up. Sprout walked by to head to the bathroom and when she came back I was stretching. She asked if I was alright and I told her I was sore and she started rubbing my shoulders. Her dad's a chiropracter so she knew what she was doing. I'm very tense!!

They did sound check, a couple interviews, and then it was show time.

The first band was <B>Optimus Rhyme</B> who were amazing!! One of my new favorites. I bought their CD (I left it at work today though!) Up next was <B>No-Fi Soul Rebellion</B> who were very entertaining and I'd like to see them again.

Then, Northern State. They mentioned my birthday, and thanked me for the shirts on stage. Amazing. Got some awesome pics, and some cool videos too.

I'd write more but I really need to go to sleep!"

"event","Absolutely amazing and more...

Liz and I left my house around 2, went to the bank, picked up Shaina, and were on our way to Portland. We made one stop on the way there, in Vader, at a gas station/Subway. Got food, left. Got to the Crystal Ballroom around 6. Waited in line for an hour, saw Angie, Kimba, and Allison. Random! Got inside, got a great spot right in front of the stage on the right side.

The first band, the Hot IQ's were very good. They had a kickass girl drummer. They sounded a lot like Hot Hot Heat.

Then, Northern State. I sang along with ALL the words. They noticed. They kept looking at me, pointing at me, winking at me, and came over to shake my hand. And they kept mentioning about how I obviously had the CDs. Amazing. Got some awesome pics thanks to it. After their set I gave them the shirts I made for them like a year ago. I gave them straight to Spero, and she absolutely loved it!! She was like ""This is so awesome, I think I might cry!"" They were all astounded that I had the sleeves be their favorite colors.. except I did that on purpose, because I asked Sprout what their favorite colors were. Spero said she would probably wear hers at the Seattle show since she's out of clean clothes.

And then, Tegan and Sara. Amazing as always. They both seemed in bad moods though, but that's probably because they've been on tour PRACTICALLY all year long. New drummer Johnny is not bad. I still miss Rob.. but he did good. I know what it's like to come into a band that's been together for quite some time and have to learn all the songs and play them live. So I have compassion for him. I only noticed him mess up a couple of times. Ted was super cute as always, and Chris just stood there like usual. He looked at me funny when they were playing Walking With A Ghost, because Liz, Shaina and I were so uninterested in singing it because we do not like that song anymore. Then he laughed. I always find it funny when Chris laughs because he always has the same look on his face.

They played My Number... which in all the times I've seen them live, I've never heard them play. Shaina gave a CD to new drummer Johnny after the show. He said he'd take a listen and hand it off to the girls. Let's hope he does :)

We headed over to the merch table afterwards and Hesta Prynn came up to me, wearing the shirt I made and asked ""Did you make this?"" Amazing. Talked to them at the merch table for a little bit. Sprout gave me a button... which is apparently the only new item of merch they have. I didn't see sweatshirts but I hope they have them tomorrow because I reallllly want one. Shaina and Liz now love Northern State. I'm trying to convince Shaina to come with me tomorrow so I don't have to go alone. I wish Liz could go but she already had to pretend be sick to come to this show.

Poor Shaina though... she works the early shift at UPS, from 3:30-8:30. I don't know what she decided on but I know when we left Portland she was contemplating not going in. The only sleep she would get would be in the car. And she was up since 2:45am! She worked at UPS yesterday and then got called into Starbucks so she didn't get to take a nap. How she made it through the entire show I have no idea. She is a super trooper.

I got cramps when we were almost to Portland so that sucked a lot. They are just now starting to go away thanks to the ibuprofen I took. And the bath I took.

Anyway I need to resize these pictures and go to bed. I am exhausted!!!"

"event","Sooooooooooooooo it's very strange... my birthday is in three days and it sure doesn't feel like it's coming up. 

I'm going to be 23.

Such a weird age. Right between 20 and 25. An awkward time I think... kind of like being 19. Already 18 but not quite 21.

To celebrate, Erin and my parents and I are going out to dinner on my birthday. The next day, Liz, Shaina and I are driving down to Portland to see Northern State and Tegan and Sara. Day after that, Northern State will be at the Crocodile and I will be first in line.

Tonight is continuing on with a new ritual... where Liz and Shaina spend the night, and the four of us (Liz, Shaina, Erin and I) spend our Sunday looking for a house we can all rent. We are trying to think of a name for the house...but maybe that will come after we find the house. We found one last weekend that is just 13 blocks north and 2 blocks east. A cute little 3 bedroom. One bedroom is tiny... so we would make that the office. And we would make the dining room Shaina's room (she's dying to have a room that isn't really a bedroom). The guy that lives in the apartment downstairs from the house is very cool. He used to be a heavy metal drummer and now does jazz stuff, so he wouldn't have a problem with noise if there ever were any. As soon as Shaina mentioned we were in a band, he was very excited. I need to drop a CD off for him still.

Speaking of the band... I got recognized yesterday. I was at Suncoast and the guy behind the counter was like ""You look familiar... are you in Alabaster?"" I said ""Yes I am"" and he said ""Bass player?"" I said ""Yup"" He said ""Jen, right?"" It was very strange. It ended up being that he's in the band The Fizzgigs, who we played with at The Funhouse, but still it felt nice that someone recognized me. Still real weird.

And apparently yesterday, Shaina's friend Jess got a message on myspace from some girl who was like ""How did you get a picture with Shaina from Alabaster? I'm so jealous!"" Freakin weird.

I have to clean up the house cuz of course it's a sty again..which sucks because for a while there it was staying clean. Me having a job and being tired all the time from lifting isn't helping.

BUT I do still love my job. All the guys I work with are awesome. Scott is like a big teddy bear. I wish I knew a straight girl I could hook him up with. He's very sweet.

Anyway, off I go a cleaning."

We got there at 5:40 last night, and apparently were the last band to arrive. The Bigtime Rep had already made the schedule and apparently couldn't change it. The only open slot was headlining. Now here are the mistakes Bigtime made:

1) They are trying to enfore a rule that you have to sell at least 35 tickets to the show in order to work with them in the future
2) We sold one ticket, were told it was fine, and were picked to have the headlining slot due to our tardiness.
3) The rep didn't even try to change the lineup, and we didn't get to play because Shaina had to be at work at 3:30 this morning
4) They do NOTHING to promote the shows
5) The bands have to print out the tickets, sell the tickets AND promote the show
6) What is the point of Bigtime? As far as I can tell, they get all the money from the ticket sales, and all they do is pick the bands, pick the date, and set it up at Studio 7.

Fucking REDICULOUS. I wish there was a better way to complain to them but they are horrible at answering emails and their website is barely ever updated.

I hate them.

"event","My band just got booked for a show at the Kirkland Teen Center. Let me give you the reasons as to why this is totally awesome:

1) We have never played there
2) It was really easy to get hooked up with this show
3) It is a Saturday night show
4) It is an all ages show
5) It's cheap
6) After we play there it will be very easy to get another show there

Downsides:
1) All other bands are playing are metal and we won't fit in with them

But really, who cares? It's going to freakin rock."

"event","I just listened to the White Stripes cover of Walking With A Ghost. It was horrible!! Not that I like that song anymore anyway... but still... it wasn't very good. But whatever I guess.

I took ibuprofen right when I woke up... just waiting for it to kick in so my cramps don't kill me anymore.

Then off to the bank I go to put my paycheck in the bank.

Paid bills last night, got the credit card payments out of the way.

Shaina is giving me money tonight, too. Yay! And then she's dying my hair. Double yay! We're thinking of doing a pink and blue thing. Thought about purple too...but will probably just do pink and blue, foiled, on the long parts of my hair. It shall be cool... I hope ;)

Our landlady has called twice today... unfortunately the first time I was asleep, and the second time was just now, and I didn't hear the phone ring. She said she would call the second she heard about someone moving out in the building that has a two bedroom. SO I think that's good news. Mostly good news because our lease is almost up and if someone is giving notice now, we probably get to move real soon. AND because we would be moving right up the stairs (only like 6 stairs) from where we are now! Yay!!"

Luckily the Element Europa order doesn't have to be shipped out until Monday morning now.. but there was still a lot of six-pack bagging to do when I left. All the black ones actually. I have no idea how many there were. Lots..

I came home from work, took a bath and then a nap. Woke up at 7:30, got online. Played video games for a bit until my xbox froze.

For the past couple hours I've been working on some band merch. http://www.cafepress.com/alabastermerch

Check it out. And if you can, buy some stuff!! We've sold one CD so far :)

Yea, so.. I hate cramps. HATE THEM."

I labeled 1260 journals today.
Then I put Element hacky sacks into individual baggies
Then put 6 Element hacky sacks into bigger baggies
Then lunch
Then packed 2 boxes for shipment to Pac Sun (300 hacky sacks per box)
Then stickered hang tags.

Tomorrow: hang tag stickering, hang tagging, more plastic baggies

WEEKEND after that!

Shaina will be dying my hair Saturday night.

I need to take a shower now so I don't have to wake up early to do it in the morning before work."

"event","We have gotten some awesome reviews on Garageband lately for Surface Damage. They make me so happy I have to post some of them:

<B>Vocals and Keyboards Prime! </B>
Vocals and the keyboards are absolutly perfect no doubt you guys put a lot of effort in to this song the vocals are really melodic along with the keyboards and guitar work is great you guys keep up the spirit and effort your putting into this band now and it will take you the next level over and over keep it up! 

<B>So Evanesence </B>
The lead vocals are AWSOME. Youve probably heard this before but u sound alot like Amy Lee and the music sounds like Evanesence, but i think u guys are better than Evanesence, this song is so awsome, the melody rocks, its not too heavy but also not too heavy, the only problem was that the song ended so fast i woulda loved to hear more. Keep up the good work. 

<B>forboding string vibe</B>
sounds like it has a real mainstream feel. Good Lead singer, engaging. Guitars add alot. Drums are pounding and screaming really works. Not conventional emo, but conventional female fronted rock music."

All the guys I work with are really cool. No dress code is nice.. Shaina wants to dye my hair blue.. and I will indeed let her.

I got there at 8:30, filled out my W4, emptied hackysacks out of bags into big tupperware, put stickers on tags, hangtagged hackysacks, took journals and scratch pads out of their boxes, labeled all individual items, put them back in their boxes. Then I was done at 4.

The best part about this job? Other than the fact I get paid $9 an hour and don't have to deal with customers? And that there's no dress code? It's a very flexible work schedule. In the morning I will show up somewhere between 8:30 and 9, and leave when I feel like it. If I need a couple days off, I just have to let Collin know. A-mazing. I had the option to not work tomorrow, but I will, because I like it. And I get weekends off. A-mazing again.

I'll know more after I get my work schedule tomorrow.

Alabaster news: We are playing a HOUSE PARTY in FALL CITY on SEPTEMBER 30. This is like $2!! Come out and support us, come one, come all. We'll be playing for 45 min to an hour. We'll pretty much play every song we have. We might even debut our brand new song, Far From Okay, but only if we've got it perfect beforehand. The address is as follows:

4142 324th Ave SE
Fall City, WA

I think we start at 9 but it doesn't hurt to show up earlier!! We will have 5 song CDs for sale for $5!"

"event","So, someone keeps borrowing my bike. It's gone for no longer than a day. Usually is taken when Erin's car is gone, and then put back when her car is there. It's been taken 3 or 4 times now. Last night it was put back in the parking spot across from ours, which has 2 motorcycles and a bike in it. I took the bolts of the front wheel and put a note on it that says ""Stop stealing my bike!"" I went out there this morning and the front tire was next to the bike, and the bike was leaning on the wall. Use the kickstand idiot! I think next time I'm going to loosen the brakes and make it look normal. OR as Erin suggested, take off the chain.

I kinda just wish they would take it now so I could buy a new bike that I like. Ugh!

In other news, Rochelle and Sarah's party was lots of fun last night, I'm glad we went.

In the best news, my Acceptance shirt came today!!

Good day. Woke up, played Sims Bustin Out for XBOX, went to the band house, practiced, went to a free pre-screening of Just Like Heaven. It was actually very good, very cute. Pretty predictable but not all of it. It was going to be a double date...but Erin couldn't go. So it was just me, Kate and Shaina.

Practice again tomorrow. I hope we get Far From Okay down... asap. I love that song. It's going to be so awesome when we have it recorded. I can't even wait for you all to hear it... Shaina's vocals in it are amazing.. as she said herself, it's not the way she sings usually. It's something completely different than she's ever done before and it's fucking AWESOME! Agh I wish we had a recording of it cuz it's constantly stuck in my head.

No word from Adventure Trading so far... If I don't hear from them tomorrow I am calling them.

Then Shaina and I played Tony Hawk 4 for Xbox. I totally kicked her ass! Then Liz came over. More video game playing until the Xbox decided to freeze. Then we watched Sorority Boys. Then Shaina had Kate come get her because she has to open at work tomorrow. Then Liz and I finished watching Sorority Boys and then watched Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. See, when this movie came out, they should have started opening White Castle's all over the place... because now I want some. Luckily, their website says they have their food in the freezer section (like as TV dinners) at Fred Meyer, Larry's Market, Albertsons, Safeway, QFC and a few more. So I will be heading by the store tomorrow to check that out :)

Liz left not too long ago. We had Pagliacci for dinner and it was delicious. Liz left $10 here. She felt bad for never paying when we eat. Silly Liz, I don't care. But that's awfully sweet of her :) I love that Liz. She has decided she is coming over every Sunday again :)

Erin has to stay over at the girls' (that she nannies for) tonight :( Sleeping alone sucks."

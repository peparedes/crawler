"event","So this weekend - outta control. Must have driven all over MI and back. Had plans with just about everyone I know, a lunch here, barbecue there, concert over here, party on the other side of town, etc. So I just woke up from my recovery sleep. Very nice. Sore all over from somebody (thanks alot Ryan) tackling my ass on Saturday night, but I guess we'll just call it war wounds from a wild weekend. Hey, I like that. Anyway, got back to Sarah's at like 5 this morning, think I might go back to bed for a bit while she's at work. Boo ya - good times."

"event","So for the first time in literally ages I have stayed at home all day today. I'm at my friend Sarah's now, one of the only places I feel really safe writing in this journal, but i was home. I think there's something wrong with me lately, i'm just very...off. And i'm in a mental conundrum about some stuff too confusing to detail here. My friends have been calling all day. One day missing and they think i'm dead. Seriously people, come on. Makes me feel kind of like i'm the life if the party tho, and that's sorta nice. I'm having strange thoughts, like if I jumped out the office window, could I make it to that tree right there without falling? I know, i'm weird, and you love it. I like to be Superman sometimes. Even though I usually end up with many bruises when I discover I can't fly*. *Note analogy HERE

My stomach hurts. Too much salad. I'm gonna rest up now before I inevitably go out for the night or the next few days. Man, I get tired of this sometimes. But what am I to do?"

"event","Wow, ok, so this is livejournal. The word is that this is the place to be. I guess we'll find out. Anyway, I'm a 20 yr old college student who's life's ambition (at the moment) is to figure out who the fuck I am trying to be. In case you were wondering, I am a trans ftm, pre-everything, transitioning pretty much on my own. My true friends are supportive but i can tell they still just don't ""get it."" This is all pretty new to me, but I can tell you, I've never felt better in my life since I decided to really go through with it, that this is who and what I am. I don't get out much, mostly because I am uncomfortable with all of the drama in the gay scene, and also because I on top of everything I can't tell what my sexuality is anymore. Boi's are hot, girls are hot, what's the diff? I've heard alot of trans guys go through this, but like I said before, this is kinda new to me. Soooo...any feedback would be great. I guess I'm not giving you much to feed back on, but hey, it's  a start. 
Ciao!"

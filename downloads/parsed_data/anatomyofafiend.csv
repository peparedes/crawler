"event","Let us go then, you and I...

The way your hair 
falls 
against the pillow is so much 
like the rain upon the streets 
within the cities made by people who 
no longer live.  Your eyes are 
brighter than any 
amount of fire within 
the conflicts and hearts of men
.  The warmth 
of your hand is greater 
than the tears and blood that 
fall 
from the eyes of 
the broken
.

When the evening is spread out against the sky...

Let the yellow fog 
slip past
, behind our backs as 
we search for a 
place of our own while the 
stars of the 
sky 
cry out to memories of Moscow.  
Our coats will brave 
the cold of the 
night  
as we wander the lonely alleys
;but have no fear.

There will be a time to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet.

The time for murder is 
passing;leaving 
with the yellow of the 
night.  So let us take our tea - 
filled with questions and indecisions.  Let the 
visions 
(and revisions) 
of creation breed 
within the night, under the 
blankets and stars.  The 
conclusion of a kiss cannot 
be formulated;pay no attention 
to the syntax of things and 
kiss wholly, as 
they are a far better fate than all else.

And it will be worth it, 
after all, 
after the cups, the marmalade, the tea, 
among the porcelain, among some talk of 
you and me.  
It will be worth it, 
after all, 
it will be worth while, 
after the sunsets and the 
dooryards and the sprinkled streets, 
after the novels, after the teacups, 
after the skirts that trail upon the floor - 
and this and so much more.  
I must seance the dead (and you) to say exactly what I mean.

Le mieux geste de mon cerveau est moins que ton oscillation de paupiere que dit que nous sommes pour l'un d'autre.  (S'il te plait, ne me part pas mort.)"

"event","My Dearest,

I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come... I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately.  I've read your letter at least four times and will probably read it more times before I'm through.
I've been sitting here looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute.  I've wanted that picutre more than anything I can think of, except of course you yourself.
I keep thinking of you, darling...keep wishing I could be home with you.  I want to leave in the worst possible way soI can come home to see you ...but things don't look so good on that subject.  This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess.
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now.  I'm completely lost without you, darling.  I never realized I could miss any one person so much.
I just hope it won't be too much longer until I""m able to be with you again and live a sane and normal life."

Oh, sam and i went and spoke to Larry at Tafe yesterday and asked if we could somehow be put upto the Cert 3 class coz this one was bullshit... And there is no way, so we have to wait out the 3 weeks. It's fun though, we just CS the whole time.<br></br>

The hand of my clock strikes two
In times when I got the best of you
We made promises we couldn't keep
And every night we couldn't sleep.
I didn't know why, but didn't ask questions
because it was the first time in my life, yeah the first time in my life
Where I, did something right.

I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time
I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time

You pick me apart
While I search for witty things to say (In my defense)
""You'll never amount to anything anyway""
(Don't press your luck, don't press your luck)
And think that I'm impressed with your one night stands
and your contagious kiss
I'm trying to get this right
Yeah, cause I'm ridiculous like that

I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time
I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time

I'll keep this as
A constant reminder
Of the nights I spent holding onto her
And rest assured I'm moving on
I miss you less, with each day you're gone
YOU'RE GONE!

I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time
I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time
I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time"

<lj-cut text=""Cut. cutcutcut."">Just as everything was starting to get better. I hate my father. I FUCKING HATE HIM!. I WANT HIM TO FUCKING DIE!!. WHY DID HE DO THIS TO ME!.

God. I was starting to get better. No more crying fits. No more throwing up. No more cutting. And all of a sudden im falling apart again, worse than ever. I hate this, i hate being like this. I have never felt as good as i did yesterday. Never. And now this.

I wish i could tell him. I wish i could tell him what everything had been doing to me upto the other day. Tell him what he brought back worse than ever.

<i>Suddenly, I'm not half the man i used to be</i>

I hate you. I hate you so much. Just get out of Zak's life and leave him to get better. He can't get better while you are here. JUST FUCK OFF!.

Now i want to grow up, so i can control my own life. I don't care about living the best years of my life. I just want to leave this place. Leave it far behind. I want to leave all the memories. I don't want to remember anything anymore. I can't think of anything anymore. All i can think about is leaving this place. I can feel it devouring my mind. Engulfing my body. I can't see anything but it. Yesterday. I want to stop it."

I think im slowly getting better. Or do i hope im slowly getting better. I dunno, it is a hard thing to differentiate between. But hopefully it is both. TAFE is so easy and boring, sam and i spent the whole time playing Harry Potter 8-). Zak wants to keel it! *stab stab*. 

On another note, i want to make icons of Doctor Who. Because his face is so perty, and it amazes me beyond my limits of amazement. Yus. That was fun.

"event","You know what?. I hate growing up, growing up sucks it big time. I just want to go back to about a year ago and stay there for the rest of my life. Am i weird?, i mean everyone is always talking about how much they want to grow up so they can go out clubbing and drinking. That just doesn't appeal to me. I don't see myself in 3 years going out and clubbing, getting pissed, getting raped or killed. I don't want to be like that.

I think the thing that repels me the most is that, growing up ultimately, people start caring what they say. Caring even more about what they wear and look like. I don't care in the slightest if i talk for hours to someone about nothing, it isn't like any of us have anything better to do yeah?. But as you get older you find things that you have to do, things like clean your house, care for a baby, take your kids to school and stuff. Then you start caring if you spend hours talking to someone about nothing. I treasure the time i spend at this age, i don't want to ruin it worrying that i have to watch what a say around certain people incase it freaks them out, makes them feel i am getting to close to them. I just want to do my own thing, as we should be able to do at this age.

And find the open road to salvation

It's not worth you wasting away
Coz you say one thing in darkness
And another when it's light
And you end it without ruling
For the best part of three days

I got a plan
How about we fly across the valleys at sundown
Then drink more whiskey til the sun it comes back up again
???
Doesn't mean that they're half bad
But they're bad

Okay since i am so bored, all the time, every month/week or so (whenever i can be bothered) i am going to put a random persons name at the top of each entry... and a picture i spose. It might be someone you know personally, it might be a celebrity, an anime character, or even someone you don't know. And you hafta think up the most imaginative place you could/would get naughty with this character, what you would say tp them, and a few other things... So even if it is a guy and you are a guy, or vice versa, don't worry about it, im sure no one is going to make fun of you on this journal, and if they do, ill schmack them. Either way, the most creative answer, will win... ummm well i havent decided yet, we shall just start with a pat on the back from me, and a laugh from everyone else:P, and then later i think that i will let you have a claim on that person/character/celeb etc. only if you want it (you can claim more than 1 person/character/celeb). If you don't the second person will, and so on and so forth for aslong as i can be bothered.

Which reminds me. The Form - 

<b>Your Name (doesn't have to be your real name)?:
First thing you would say to them?:
What would you call them?:
Place you would/could get naughty with them?:
[IF, you are the most creative, would you like to claim them?: (not included at the moment)]</b>

omewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

So don't say no
Don't say nothing's wrong
Cos when you get back home
Maybe I'll be gone

It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it

I need something to preoccupy myself. I want Kingdom Hearts II already dammit! :(. And i still need to beat Ansem in KH. I can't do it, i have a tally of the amount of times i have tried. it now numbers 128, add a couple on for the few i did beforehand. I can't goddamn beat him, and levelling up is so long and boring. Everyone says, just get to level 60 and then try. But i am the master of passing games with low levels, i did Final Fantasy IX and i was only level 38, when everyone was saying you should be at least level 60. It is so frustrating to go and try to beat him and fail miserably 128+ times. I'm not used to losing :(. I hate losing!.

Put those words together: 

I did something
I shouldn't have
You
Stop talking to me again
It
Happen all over again

Make a few minor changes. Put them all together: 'I did something, i shouldn't have. You, stopped talking to me again. It happened all over again.'

Rock Eisteddfod on thursday night. Everyone did really good. Jess and Rat, coz you guys are the only people who did the Rock Eisteddfod, and read my journal. Well done guys:D. We got through to the final!!, August the 20th?... or something around then.

I was playing footy afterwards while we were waiting for the rewards to be handed out. And i stepped sideways on my foot, and totally fucked it. The same way i did to my other foot 2 years ago. I don't think it is broken this time but. I can't walk on it, and it only hurts if i try to put it in a shoe.

Ummm what else. Yeah the fight with Nell. Im actually glad it happened, as cruel as it sounds. I really didn't want to talk to her anymore. Emily is pissed at me now, coz i got pissed at her coz she told me to go back to pining over Jess. Apparently she didn't mean it how i took it.

*sigh* I want someone to read Harry Potter so i can discuss the whole thing with them... someone?.

Work sucks, i have no motivation to work or aaanything except play WoW with Rupert. Stupid game. I hate it. It keeps forcing me to make friends. I met a girl from Hawaii on it the other day her name is Lanna. What a cool name huh?. I want it. It sounds so anime. Ummm yeah, she is cool.

What else. I have to go to this stupid quiz night thing tonight, i don't wanna go. Someone better talk to me while i am there. Table of 8 people!!!!, i can hardly stand being around my family, let alone 2 other families.

Ummm yes, i did something last night i promised myself i wouldn't, and ultimately i shouldn't have, because you will stop talking to me again, and it will happen all over again.

And i wanna play FFIX again. But i only have the first 2 discs which i downloaded, and couldnt get the second 2.

Going now.

I try to see but i'm blinded
By the white light
I can't remember how

I'm lying here tonight
And i can't stand the pain
And i can't make it go away
No i can't stand the pain

I'm hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again

Number 9 - Scotty Doesn't Know - Lustra

Scotty doesn't know that Fiona

Number 8 - When A Dead Man Walks - Lacuna Coil

Paranoia
In which I think that I'm not confident
Blood into my hands I can't deny
A buzz into my ears that makes me mad

But I don't look back
While I'm waiting to die
I don't look back
In a weird lullaby
I'll carry on
And the hope in my heart is dry

But I don't look back
And I cannot reply
I don't look back
While I'm waiting to lie
I'll carry on
While they want to decide for me

Once again

Living in their cage
They are killing me

Paranoia
In which I think I'm not that confident
A tiny hope that burns into my breath
A bitter smile delights me at the end

Number 7 - When I Get There - Anthony Callea

I wish that i could breathe,
A moment just to be here, 
A chance to take it in, 
Before i have to leave

So this is how it feels, 
To wakl into a daydream, 
Can't tell you how my heart sings, 
To see it all for real

When you do, what you love, it feels amazing, 
If you do, what you love, you can do anything at all

I always said when i get there, 
I'll change the world, I'll take more care, 
I'll touch the sky, be more prepared, 
When i get there

The road rolls on and on,
It twists a while and then it turns,
Where here turns onto there's long gone, 
When you do, what you love, it feels amazing, 
If you do, what you love, you can do anything at all

I always said when i get there, 
I'll change the world, I'll take more care, 
I'll touch the sky, be more prepared

I packed my bags, 
I left my room, 
There's nothing more that i can think to do, 
Now i need to breathe, 
I just need to breathe

I always said when i get there, 
I'll change the world, I'll take more care, 
I'll touch the sky, be more prepared, 
When i get there

Number 6 - Unwell - Matchbox 20

All day, staring at the ceiling
Making friends with shadows on my wall
All night, hearing voices
Telling me that I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for something
Hope gone, feeling like I'm headed for a breakdown
And I don't know why

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

Me, talking to myself in public
Dodging glances on the train
And I know, I know they've all been talking about me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me
Out of all the hours thinking
Somehow I've lost my mind

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough, you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talking in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're taking me away

But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired

Number 5 - Vermillion, Pt. 2 - Slipknot

She seems dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
Shes a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

But I won't let this build up inside of me
But I won't let this build up inside of me
But I won't let this build up inside of me
But I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't......no
I don't want to be this

But I won't let this build up inside of me
(won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
(won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
(won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
(won't let this build up inside of me......won't let this build up inside of me)

She isn't real
(won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(won't let this build up inside of me)
She isn't real
(won't let this build up inside of me)

Number 4 - If Only She Knew - Michelle Branch

I don't know whose side I'm takin'
But I'm not takin' things too well
I can see inside you're achin'
But is it still too early for me to tell?

I try to help you out through the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat and I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you

'Cause I still love you like I did before
I know for sure that you still feel the same way I do
If only she knew
Whoa, if only she knew, oh

I try to let it go
but I don't know if I can take it
'Cause the way you looked at me
Made me see that I can't really fake it

I try to help you out through
the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat and I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you

'Cause I still love you like I did before
I know for sure that you still feel the same way I do
If only she knew
Whoa

I know she loves you and I can't interfere
So I'll just have to sit back and watch my world disappear
Whoa

I try to help you out through
the hardest of times
Your heart is in your throat and I'm speaking my mind
Though it looks as if it's over
I'm still not over you
Oh, I'm still not over you

'Cause I still love you like I did before
I know for sure that you still feel the same way I do
Whoa
'Cause I will never ever walk away
I'll find a way
She could never love you like I do
If only she knew

If only she knew, oh yeah
Na na na na na na na na.

Number 3 - Per Sempre (For Always) - Anthony Callea

Sometimes i feel you, 
Like a beautiful light, 
Guiding my hand, 
Through the darkest night

Sometimes i hear you,
Like a whispering breeze,
In the call of the songbird, 
In the distant trees

And sometimes if i close my eyes, 
I can see another place and time

And sometimes i cry, 
And sometimes i hurt, 
Though i will always know
I've been loved
And sometimes i bleed, 
From my broken heart, 
Though i will always know i've been loved, 
For Always

Bella bocca di rubini, 
Amore dolce aura spiri,
Non parlare, parlare

Bella rosa fresca, 
Lo posso ben amare,
Laciamo baci dire le parole

And sometimes if i close my eyes, 
I can see another place and time

Sempre fedele ti voglio amar, 
Chiede quest'anima amante, 
Sempre fedele ti voglio amar, 
Il pianto sistiene l'amore
Per Sempre

And here beneath this sky of stars,
I feel you're never far away

And sometimes i cry, 
And sometimes i hurt, 
Though i will always know
I've been loved
And sometimes i bleed, 
From my broken heart, 
Though i will always know i've been loved, 
For Always

Per Sempre

Number 2 - Disease (Acoustic) - Matchbox 20

Feels like you made a mistake.
You made somebody's heart break.
Now I have to let you go, I have to let you go.
You left a stain on everyone of my good days.
But I am stronger than you know.
I have to let you go.
No one's ever turned you over.
No one's tried to ever let you down.
Beautiful girl, bless your heart.

I got a disease, deep inside.
It makes me feel uneasy baby.
I can't live without you.
Tell me, what am I supposed to do about it?
Keep your distance from me.
Don't pay no attention to me.
I got a disease

Feels like your making a mess.
With your hell on wheels and a black dress.
You drove me to the fire, and left me in the burner.
Every little thing you do is tragic.
All my life, it all was magic.
Beautiful girl, I can't breathe

I got a disease, deep inside me.
It makes me feel uneasy baby.
I can't live without you.
Tell me, what am I supposed to do about it?
Keep your distance from me.
Don't pay no attention to me.
I got a disease

And well I think that I'm sick.
Well leave me be, while my world is coming down on me.
You taste like honey, honey.
Tell me can I be your only?
Be, be strong
I keep telling myself that it won't take long, until I'm free of my disease.
Free of my disease

Hell, when I got a disease deep inside me,
It makes me feel uneasy, baby.
I cant live without you.
Tell me what am I supposed to do about it?
Keep your distance from me.
Don't pay no attention to me.
I got a disease

And well I think that I'm sick.

Number 1 - The Only - Static-X

I'm winning, You're losing.

Your agony,

Before, your forgotten memory.
Heaven, Your Hell.
I'm killing your fantasy.

This is the only, Give me the only thing.
Tired of trying, I'm tired of lying.

You follow, your deepest reality.

You're trying to take me, They're trying to make me.

"event","You know what. I want this damn lady out of our house.

She turned up about 2 weeks ago, because she had left her boyfriend. Mum and her are really good friends, which is the reason she is welcome. But when she starts ordering us around, and telling us (i.e Meika and I) to do things. Like today she said to me that mum had said it was alright for her to move into my room for a few weeks. I was like ':O!! NO! GET YOUR OWN FUCKING ROOM!'. My room is the only place that i can escape from my family. Which is why i spend so much time down here. 

Then later on, Meika was watching Red Dwarf, and i was reading and half watching. She walks in and says 'Turn it onto Lost', and i said 'No, we are watching Red Dwarf, we'll tape it and you can watch it later'. She then demanded that she be allowed to watch lost because it is the only show on tv she watchs, (apart from black books, spicks and specks, the bill and Home and Away, of course... or did she forget to mention those.

She also has the nerve to complain about how loud it is in the house is stressing her out. She doesnt have to fucking be in here. If it is so hard to live with, why doesnt she fucking go somewhere else.

I think she has extended her stay for a little too long.

Stupid bitch.

And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me
Out of all the hours thinking
Somehow I've lost my mind

I know right now you can't tell
But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talking in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're taking me away

She wanted something just like the real thing
He needed love and it all worked out some how
Be knows that love is the king of emotion
But he can't touch her because she's too perfect now

But she wasn't like that then and
He wasn't like that then
They were everything, everything they need

Suffer me
Call on me and i, i'll call on you
Suffer me
Call on me and i, I'll call on you, call on you

She wasn't thinking about anyone else just then
But she knew someone else would always come to mind
Because they were strangers living in the feeling
They were scared when they heard they talked about love

But it wasn't like that then
It just wasn't like that then
They took everything because everything was for real

Suffer me
Call on me and i, i'll call on you
Suffer me
Call on me and i, I'll call on you, call on you

Oh yes they were thinning out
At that moment they were all afraid
Started thinking that pretty soon one of them would leave
She said suffer me"

This small place is my whole world,
I never go outside.
In here I can be what I like,
No rules by which to abide.

Many have tried to get inside
This domain of mine,
But each and every one has failed,
They don't realise that I'm just fine.

They say that I should open up,
And join the rest of the world,
But then I would be like the rest,
Just a face amongst the crowd.

So I'll stay here if you don't mind,
Locked up in my little space,
You go out and join the rest,
And enjoy your little race."

<lj-cut text=""Take your memories i don't need 'em"">

Oh god. I know that my gf and i had separated, but tonight, i found out that she likes someone else. Jesus christ it hurts so much to think about it. She told me she wasnt ready for a relationship. I dont know what to believe other than how i feel, and how i feel is totally fucking shithole.

I really want her back but i cant trust her like i used to anymore. I dont know what to do.

It's so ironic.

Courtney, get online now, we have some serious bonding to do, we arent so different anymore man.

God i love this song so much.

<i>I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better

I just decided today that i have enormous respect for actors who are married or have a girlfriend, and are willing to kiss other guys on set in a movie. I was watching red dwarf today when Lister sticks his tongue down Rimmer's throat, and i thought 'wow, i would totally never be able to do that in my entire life'... Respect is way up i tell you.

Oh and maaajorly pissed off at my parents. Apparently they will not buy me a car when i get my license, nor will they put any money towards one. Makes me so angry!. Especially when mum gave me a lecture the other day because i wanted something for my birthday (which by the way, never happens to me because i never want anything for my birthday except the right to be antisocial), and she started lecturing me about the amount of money they are going to have to spend on me in the next 3-4 years. The things she listed were 

1. Stuff for my room (i.e some fucking proper curtains, not the ones where people can easily see through at night)
2. Food
3. Tafe
<b>4. A CAR</b>

Now correct me if im wrong, i want comments here. The question is

How many peoples parents pay for their childs a) Food b) Schooling c) Things for your room e.g beds, curtains, paint etc, and d) for those with cars, did your parents buy it for you, or put a little bit towards it, no matter how small?.

Comments people.

Okay well that's them... My dad has taken my Computer, TV, Ps2 and Bedroom (meaning i have to go back up to the house and live back up there!) away. All because i got 30% on my english Exam. Even though i pwned Maths, passed info sys got an A in Digital Media. GRRR!

So i won't be online for prolly a few months, so i'll only post during digital media or info sys.

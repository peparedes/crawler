Almost everyone at Degrassi came, and it was really fun. I actually saw Heather Sinclaire at my party, she hung out with me for awhile. She's pretty nice. Darcy, Manny, and Heather sprayed cheese all over my brother, that was really nice. Except he deserved a little more than cheese spray. JT came too, we hung out for awhile, just doing typical JT-and-Liberty stuff. <s>Where is Terri these days? Aren't they going out?</s>

I heard Heather's having a girl's night, it sounds like a blast. I hope Terri can come, I haven't talked to her for the longest time, I'm getting worried. JT didn't even say anything about her when we were talking. I hope she's ok. <s>Maybe this is a good thing, JT not talking about Terri...hmmm...</s>

"event","I'm so sorry I haven't updated. I kind of suck at this whole journal thing if you haven't noticed. Anyway, I've hung out with Terri a lot the last month. She's so awesome, I couldn't ask for a nicer friend. And JT, well he's JT. <s>Super hot and sweet...oh Liberty get over him already!</s>

((sorry for not updating, been super busy with my graduation and all, so my apologies to everyone!))

Ok, well just to let you know I'm having a Fourth of July party. Everyone's invited, just comment to let me know if you're coming. Thanks a ton! And don't worry, none of the rents will be there.

"event","Wow, where have I been? It's been a long time since I updated, sorry about that. You could of sworn I moved or something.

Nothing has been going on. Just up here, bored, same nothingness as usual.<s>I miss JT, it sucks that he's always taken.</s>

Shortest entry ever, I know, but I'm gonna try to make use out of myself, however I'll be doing that.

"event","Yeah, I haven't updated. Shoot me. But I've been busy with school stuff...stuff only someone like me would do. I bore myself to death too. Although Emma and Darcy came over yesterday, I'm still just so <b>bored</b>.
Maybe I should have a party. But, once again, no one would come. Maybe I should just move away and be done with it already. No one wants me here anyway, maybe Darcy, Emma, and JT, but that's it. I don't know why being bored is bothering me so much, because about 7 million people are probably bored right now. It's just that I <b>always</b> seem to be alone in my room typing for no reason at all. So I'll just stop wasting my time.

By the way, happy Mother's day.

"event","JT and Terri, so happy for you guys, and I wish you the best :)

For me...basic boring old borningness. Guys, we really need to make plans or something, I am practically a recluse here! We girls need to get together for a girls night or something. If anyone ever needs someone to host a shindig of yours, the love shack is always available! (aka hot tub)

Ahhhhh...I'm dying here!

"event","I'm just chillin today. JT and I talked yesterday, it's kinda weird because both of us can't remember when we broke up. It's been such a long time. The only reason we broke up was because of my dad, and my dad is a stuck up asshole, and he really didn't like JT. Strange, I know. Anyway, I stopped at Hazel's yesterday night, her party was pretty fun. It was nice to just get away from home, it hasn't been that great. Danny, as you know, is Danny as usual, trying to sing and annoying the heck out of me. My dad, being really strict. I almost couldn't go to Hazel's party. 

Anyone want to come over and chill with me? Dad and Danny are gone today, so I have the hot tub and house to myself. I need to relax.

"event","What's up? It's Liberty Van Zant here, or as my friends call me, Libs. I'm in 10th grade at Degrassi C.S, the most complicated school ever. Since everyone else at Degrassi has one of these journals, and since Manny's kept pushing me to get one, I got one. Plus, a little socializing doesn't hurt.

Most of you know me as Degrassi's head of the Grapevine who's had a crush on a certain guy named JT forever. Sure, that's true, but I'm not just smart and I'm not just JT's lover. I give pretty good advice, and if you ask Manny, I'm a pretty good friend too. So, IM me at xolibsxo...we can chat and I'm prove to you I'm not the dork that people think I am.

I was packing and stuff, but Karissa is studying and I feel bad making noise even though I'm sure I already pissed her off with what packing I did do.  O-well chemistry is a hard final so I'll be kind! hehe (Even though, I'm sure the typing is annoying too, eep =(  )  

Ok, so, I'm leaving for Ireland on January 17 and arriving on the 18th in the morning.  Classes start on the 23 so those free days will be spent unpacking, settling in, exploring, and hopefully making Irish friends! hehe

The term ends on April 24 and I will then be doing one of two things.  

1.  Immediately coming home then repacking for a three week trip to Ghana (West Africa) On May 14.
The greatest part about this trip is that its completely and utterly FREE!!  Yep, plane ticket and all ('cept for presents!)  I will get 6 political science credit and 6 Honor's credits, which will put me over the top! I wonder if you can graduate with double distinguished honors?  hehe One only catch . . . I have to be accepted.  There was a resume, essay, and interview in front of a committee of about 4 people.  Yeah, I'll know if I made it by Friday.  There were 15 applicants and 2 get to go, so we'll see.  I'll keep you all updated (if you care or not!)

2.  Flying to England and staying with my family for about 3 weeks, than hoping a flight to Italy to study Art and Italian for a month, while traveling to Rome, Venice, Florence, and Naples (nipples HAH!)  This will start on May 22 - June 23.  I will have to take out a loan for this trip, but I think I should get it all done before it's too late to do anything cool. Right?  I should have to go through an acceptance thing for this one too, but I was invited by my drawing professor who wants me to major in art, so he already told me that I can go.  (It's not the hard, he hasnt filled all the spots yet, thats why! hehe)

I don't know which one I want to do more!  If I get accepted to Ghana then I'll probably do that because this Summer Honor's thing is a really big deal to be accepted to, and its free.  But I really really really reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally wanna go to Italy. I guess I could do it next year.

Alright, well I'll be home tomorrow.  
Lata foos

This was taken from Cara!  hehe

Ok, so here's the story.  Instead of going to England I will now be studying in Dublin, Ireland in the spring! WEEEEEEEEEEE  I am sooooooooo excited!  Theres also this airport or something that flys you all over europe for free!  You just have to pay the taxes and stuff but it comes out unbelievably cheap!  So, that excites me as well.  Oh, I also figured I would study Political Science and do a possible minor in Sociolgy which is good because Ireland has a really good Sociology department and I can take 15 credits and they can allcount for something which means I won't be too far behind, so thats cool.  Well thats all I have for now.

P.S.  Everyone should begin making arrangements to come visit me on St. Patty's Day!  And we'll party with the TRUE irish!

Later folks

Ok, now let me explain.

As you all know, I think, I would be going to England in the spring for the semester, right?  Well, I just recently found out that Plymouth isn't going to be excepting any exchange students for the semester.  Now, keep in mind I was told, along with five other people, that we would be studying abroad in England in the spring.  So, needless to say I am a little upset and very confused.  There is still a chance that I will be going I just have to wait a whole week to find out whats going on.  In the meantime I have to schedule classes for both England and LHU, just in case.  Also, I have no gen.eds. left to take which means the time has come to decide on a major.  Oh, and I don't want to major in psychology anymore.  I am now thinking about international studies and when I told my mom shes like and what are you going to do with that?  Shit, I don't know!  I don't know anything.  Hm . . . I just have alot to think about and accomplish in a short time and I just wanted to vent.  So, I apoligize for being whiny and stuff.  I'm just really confused and in a bit of a bad mood.  But anyway . . . um . . . yeah.  I'm done.

Does anyone remember the Holocaust?  Well, what if I told you that it is still going on today?  Well, it is!  There is still genocide going on in Africa!  The Sudan needs your help!  If you are interested in helping I am selling t-shirts that say ""Stop the genocide!""  They are $12.00 and the proceeds go to the International Rescue Committee.  Please, if you want to let me know and I can give you more information.  This is a really good cause and it will raise awareness, because you don't know how many people don't even know what Sudan is.

Whats up?  It has been a hectic first couple weeks and not quite getting any better. O-well at least I'll learn how to budget me time.  

I am now a leader of two activity groups for the Honors progam. . . Global Aid and Video seris.  Global Aid is our volunteer group where we help out the world!  Yeah, world.  It didnt start off to well but now i think its gonna get better.  We are allowed to raise funds which means more funner (yeees) projects to do.  This week we wrote letters to the troops and I think we're gonna adopt a child this week.  yep like those commercials we see.  Also, our honors director is really excited about the group so hes planning trips for us and everything.  Karissa and my other group is a movie watching group. . . during one of our meetings the Director metioned that no one picked up the group and they need someone, so Karissa and I decide Hey, why not?  So were gonna watch international movies like Amalie, Motorcycle Diaries and so on.  So yeah, and we get paid for the hours that are above what we need, which means ill get paid so some of this crap!  SWEET.

Anyway . . . I'm going to a meeting tomorrow about planning a trip to the Gulf over Thanksgiving, and I really wanna do it.  Lets hope its not too much money!

I finally have a somewhat plan for my future . . . or just a major.  Psychology with minors in international studies and biology.  I have it somewhat worked out where I can get double credit for alot of my classes.  That way I don't have to go to school for and extra million years.  Even thought that would be better than getting a job.  Or paying back loans.

Karissa, Amy, and I are all doing Habitat for Humanity this Saturday so that should be fun.  Well thats it for now.

Later gator

Sorry about leaving you hanging on the last post.  I haven't had a computer since i got here because stupid dell took too long sending it to me.  O-well.  I shall have it when I go home this weekend.  Gosh, it feels like Ive been at school fooooooooooooreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeever!  and it's only been like 5 days. Can't wait to go home though and get my computer and to play Kareoke revolution!! who0o.  that'll be fun.  

So yeah, about my major.  I think i might do business (i know, not exciting) because I wanna start my own.  I wanna own this cute little tea house and an irish pub.  but i was looking at all the classes i would have to take and they all really suck.  So i was also thinking since LHU only offers business administration I would only minor in it since you dont even need a degree to start a business.  I could just take classes like finance and business law and other helpfull ones and major in something else.  What you may hear yourself asking . . . i dont know maybe pychology or sociology, just cause i like to learn about that stuff.

But i dont know . . . im going to talk to my advisor tomorrow so maybe she could help (yeah right).  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOh yeah, damn LHU neglected to tell me that Liverpool, England will not be offered as a choice for spring semester!  So now im looking at plymouth or scottland.  They both sound really cool so I hope this will still work out.

well i dont feel like typing anymore . . . so ill talk to y'all later

I had to write two essays, i got part of one right but then confused the UN with the EU and with how much they were worth . . . i failed.

And the worst part is that while walking with karissa, i said i was gonna forget and fail and she said have you ever failed anything yet? no, then youre not gonna fail.

Well that worked didn't it.

Oh and add one more assignment to my list thats all due in the sam two days!

Yeah so this weekend was really fun. 

On Friday i actually got a bit of a paper done that isn't due til tuesday (I wanna try and write a bunch more today).  Then Dinner with the peeps left here for the weekend.  Then i showered and Amy came up to watch a movie to waste time before going to the football house at li8ke 10.  we watched Whats Eating Gilbert Grape . . . Great Movie!  So I decided that after the party I was gonna stay over Amy's so we went to her dorm after the movie.  Then waited around for Thriston and Erie to call so we could go.  Then they did, hehe , right on time I might add!  SO we walked in the blistering cold to the football house and partyed.  Well I drank like 4 cups of beer but for soem reason didnt feel it so i stopped.  Amy managed to find herself a nice guy very quickley and was with him for the night and so I just hung around Thriston and we danced and stuff.  NOt too bad.  So we left at like 1:30 and AMy and I ordered pizza then slept.  

Saturday we got up and ate then got I got ready for AShley to come! weeee.  when she got here we just hung out a bit then went to Wally with amy and thriston.  then dinner. then it was off to Penn State to visit bartley!!!!! yay.  so much fun.  we went to THON which is like this 48 hour dance a thon thing thats like a really big deal to people who go to penn state, i dont understand it though its just a hell of a lot of people, not dancing no, but just standing.  it should be called the Stand a Thon!  SO anyway after that we went for some coffee at Starbucks, then to 2000 degrees.  THis is where you get to pick out a piece of ceramic and paint it then they fire it and its sooooooooo awesome!  so we each made a shot glass but we dont get it till spring break cuase it take a couple days to fire so Bart is just gonna bring it home for us.  after that we decided to go to the Huka Lounge. so we sat down in a circle of nice big comfy chairs and with an awesome band and just smoked and talked! very cool.  Amy and I shared a banana flavored one, bart had rose, and ashley had vanilla.  all very good. then after the band ended they went arounf and talked to everyone and now they want to come play for us here in LHU so they're gonna emial us and see what we can do. cool.  so we left and ate at Jimmy John's, an awesome sandwhich place! soooooooooo good!  hmmm then what . . .oh yeah we stopped in at this frat but it was really retarded so we left (kicked out?) and took a nice walked back to bartley's where we watched creepy cartoons and then crashed with ellen making us laugh.  which bring me to today

Sunday ate brunch at bart's.  yummy.  now im here and ashley's gone.  sad.  i tried napping but didnt work so i showered and now i think im gonna try to do some work before dinner.

It was so great to be around ashley and bartley! i feel kinda bad cause amy prolly had no idea what we were talking about since we speak in inside jokes! hehe I haven't laughed that hard in a while it was nice!"

So whats up?  

I just finished reading some new posts and got the hankering to update.  So i just got done highlighting my World Politics book.  Im trying to get ahead or at least enough done so i dont get behind by having fun this weekend! haha Karissa, Amy, and I are going to Juniata (karissa's boyfriend's college) for the weekend, so that should be a good time.

Oh, so LHUP is being all retarted with housing this year and theres a chance that some people may not get a dorm.  So they did this lottery thing to pick dorms.  i picked my number yesterday and guess what number i got . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ONE!! yes me, I, managed to pick number one which means i can live anywhere on campus i want and that includes the campus village which are apartments!  who0o0o so yeah im gonna get a triple and room with karissa and amy.  good times.  WE GET A KITCHEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thats all im excited for hehe.

hm . . . what else.  Ive gots lots a work to do. my Racial and Ethnic Relations class sucks. i thought it would be good.  it is interesting but i dont think i care for my prof.  hes so nice and cool i just dont like the way he explains things.  we took a quiz in that class today and nothing that he said would be on it was.  so i dont think i did very good and that means bad grade and i haven;t seen one of those in a while. DAMN IT! 0-well i guess ill deal.

LAMBZILLA!!!  ""shear terror!""

um . . . i cant wait to go home.  not this weekend next weekend. so yay! 

im on a diet again.  but this time im actually doing pretty well.  i just hope i stick to it.  i have a picture of the bathing suit i want hanging on my mirror. and it helps slightly that theres a model wearing it, for a little extra motivation.

i was reminising (spelling??) the other day.  its crazy but i miss high school!

Oh dear. . .a few of my ""friends"" here are mad at me, karissa, and amy for some reason and they arent talking to us anymore and we have no clue why.  remind me to never again make friends with so many females!  I effinfg hate drama its so stupid and time consuming! ahhhhhhhhhhhh and its making me mad and i hate that im getting mad over someone not talking to me for a reason that i dont know of! jeepers damn girls and their damn drama.  i need a guy fix!

well . . . i think that be it
you people should call me sometime!  575-5913
lata, foos!"

You're shy<br>at times but friendly, and you are never weak<br>and always independent. You are incredibly<br>intelligent (wise beyond your years) and have a<br>talent for many things (sports, music, art).<br>You have a kind and warm personality and enjoy<br>the simple things. Like hanging out with<br>friends and watching movies at home. But you're<br>sometimes quiet nature makes you a bit of an<br>outcast and a mystery to people. No matter how<br>pretty you are or smart or athletic, you just<br>can't seem to break into the crowd and be<br>noticed. Don't worry, try to be more outgoing<br>and speak out when you have more to say. Don't<br>hide behind your books and sports and computer,<br>get out there and get noticed. You also have<br>deep desires in life and feel vunerable and<br>alone at times. Don't feel sad either, What<br>helps me to express feelings and dreams that I<br>can't say to people, is through my writting.<br>Maybe you should try.

Well ive been home since Friday but i forgot about Live Journal...0-well.  So the weekend was great. Justin and Vinnie came down on Saturday and there was a bunch of drunken fun going on . . . but Justin does not remember it.  He gave me a dimond heart necklace thing (not the $99 one from Kays that comes in that box thing - mines nicer!)  but i didnt' have his gift yet since it didnt come in the mail (but it came on monday and i gave it to him then).  So sunday we went for chinese not without an hour of trying to figure out how to get the damn cars off the driveway.  While we did that Justin slid down the driveway mtiple times then ran back up, it was hilarious, he should be a skater.  So after we ate Justin and Vinnie made the sincere attempt to go back to allentown but missed the exit becuase they were talking (such women!) and got lost so they came back and stayed another night!  yay  so when they got back they showered and such then we went to Ides to play pool.  Yeah, we saw Ben and the crew there (slightly akward) then we bowled.  when we got home we were hungry so we ate and watch the life of Ron Jeremy (very entertaining)  On monday we went shopping and i got nothing accomplished except for buying myself a pair of shoes (ghetto ones - justin's proud) then we ate at Old Country buffet!  ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww ashley and i just ate the salad.  then we went home and watched finding nemo.  it was funny to see how much vinnie and justin enjoyed it.  then they had to leave since it was already late. =( 

Last night ashley and i shopped.  and now im here, by myself, not bad though...i just cleaned and now i must shower then im gonna call New Kitty and we'll so something hopefully.  the swim meet is today!  so ill go to that and see a bunch 0 people.  steds an official!! whooo

oh yeah i got my grades . . . i have a 4.0 . . . not bad.
so lata people"

Whats up?

I'm bored and I really dont have much to say.  Except one thing . . . about the election.  I am not angry at the outcome because I very well knew what was going to happen.  However it still makes me very sad, not angry but sad.  I'm just thinking about all the people who wont be able to get married or have a civil union now.  I dont understand how the constitution may be amended becuase of someone's religious beliefs.  I know that 11 or 12 states have already banned it and i just can't comprehend it.  I dont know, I'm not good with words and trying to get my piont accross but I just wanted to say that it's just sad."

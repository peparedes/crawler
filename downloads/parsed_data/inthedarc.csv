"event","he looked up and standing in the door- way was a ghost. it was as if it was conjured from the horrors of some young childs nightmare ,yet it was real. for real blood dripped from the black holes that were once eyes and snot clumped around its nose, and a icy hand stretched forward grabing handful after handful or stale air, as if pulling its self forward by means of a rope that was invisible to all but him, hand after hand he came twords the man who no knew there was no avoiding the impending confrontation. so he threw his head back and brouhgt his back to rest flat upon his comfrtable grave and stared up at the blank night sky, there was no moon and there were no stars no witness what would soon happen to the man, there was nobody.
         and teh ground beneath  him began to conform under his wieght to fit every groove and contour of his body it held him there in a warm mix of sensations a jaded nausiosness that coaxed him forcefully into a state of paralysis. and all he could do is watch as the spector began to follow thew rope down his throat. fistfull after fistfull of the mans expelled breath allowed the ghost to come forward. and when he reached the mans throat he stole his breth before it came to him and soon his lungs ceased to function, yet his eyes and mine still worked, the ghost then pulled the man up, and instantainiuosly vanished from this realm. and a rope fell down fom the sky, which was now brightly light by the moon and stars that once betrayed him, and he grasp out for the ropeand began his journey, fistfull after fistfull he traveled from his end to the end of another.
         the specter continued his forward march tords the poor ol man, still tugging at his translucent lin, forward until he reached the mans mouth. he hesitated and then began to pull again,"

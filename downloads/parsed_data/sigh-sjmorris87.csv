"event","So everytime I think I'm finally just ready to forget she even exists, something will happen.&nbsp; About three days ago I finally got myself a facebook.&nbsp; My friends were bugging me and I was missing out on outings, so I decided to just do it.&nbsp; 

Today I got a friend request off one of her friends.&nbsp; The friend that was the other bridesmaid in her wedding, no less.&nbsp; Browsing through this person's friends, led me to my sister's facebook page.&nbsp; Why can't I even do something simple and fun like create a space on the web for myself and my friends without her appearance?"

"event","Ok I'm not sure how easily non Australians are going to understand the major points behind this rant, but I need to do it anyway.<br /><br />Recently there has been a push in my state (NSW) to put tougher restrictions on those of us with a provisional licence (P plates).&nbsp; These restrictions have been approved (it was an election year and the mindless mobs were chanting for it) and will come into effect in two weeks.&nbsp; I don't agree with them at all (in case I was being too subtle with my disagreement.).&nbsp; The restrictions include:<br /><ol><li>Loss of licence if caught doing even 5km or more over the speed limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>I'm not a big fan of speeding (although I do speed more often than I should), but this law is only fair if applied to the entire populace.&nbsp; Putting such a restriction on only one part of the driving population is almost a green light to the other parts to speed.&nbsp; Someone on their full licence can be doing 30km/hour over the speed limit and still not lose their licence, whereas I would for doing one sixth of that.&nbsp; That is bullshit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  2.&nbsp;&nbsp; All L and P plates must be displayed OUTSIDE the car only.<br /><br />I display mine inside my car.&nbsp; I have P plates that stick to your windscreen and back window and are clearly visible to all passing cars and pedestrians.&nbsp; They are at eye level, making them SUPERIOR to the plates you use on the outside.&nbsp; Forgetting all that, there is no viable alternative.&nbsp; You are not allowed to put the plates behind your number plates, as they must be visible, the magnetic ones kill the paint on your car, and apparently, plates are known to be stolen when left on the outside of the car.&nbsp; There is a metal frame you can buy and screw onto your number plates so that it sticks out past the plate on one side, but this doesnt solve the theft issue.&nbsp; It also isn't entirely fair to assume we can all afford to go out and buy these (I have no idea how much they cost, so it's just a general whinge here).&nbsp; The L plates provided with your learner licence are cardboard and get TRASHED in the rain.&nbsp; In Sydney it will rain heavily for a week at a time.&nbsp; Not ideal to have cardboard out in the rain for that long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you're under 25, you are restricted to one passenger in the car only between 11pm and 5am.<br /><br />And here we come to the one I disagree with the most.&nbsp; I predict that this restriction will result in MORE accidents not less.&nbsp; There will be more cars on the road during the 'worst' hours of the night, people WILL start driving after having a few drinks, given that the designated driver system has now been unbelievably screwed, and people no longer have a safety backup set of eyes.&nbsp; There have been so many times when a passenger, both in the front and back seats, has spoken up to warn the driver of an incoming danger whilst I've been in the car (both as driver and passenger), that I'm sure I'd be dead by now if passengers were restricted to one.&nbsp; A lot of the accidents that were reported recently that led to the outcry for tougher restrictions, involved people who were speeding or drunk, or breaking a different law.&nbsp; Putting tougher restrictions in place will not solve anything.<br /><br />If they were really serious at fixing the problem then they would implement a testing system that actually tests your ability to drive, and improve the driver education system.&nbsp; None of this punishment, revenue raising, crowd pleasing crap.<br /><br />And just as both a final note, and a commenter warning; it has been suggested to me that once I'm off my P's I will no longer care.&nbsp; This is not so.&nbsp; I, unlike the majority of people I know, it appears, have a social conscience and cannot help taking up causes where people are being treated unfairly. This will not change when I am not one of the affected people.&nbsp; I fight for the cause of Gay and Lesbians without ever feelnig the need to stick my tongue down another female's throat.&nbsp; Some of us have this ability to feel empathy and compassion for groups that we do not belong to."

"event","The other night I was driving home from work and listening to the radio.&nbsp; They were doing a call in segment trying to find people who had never read an entire novel in their lives.&nbsp; People were actually calling in admitting to this fact.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD???&nbsp; Why are people so proud of their inability to read a novel?&nbsp; It's got to be one of the most embarrassing things I've ever heard of, and yet these people were PROUD of their ""achievement""?!&nbsp; And other people thought it was funny???

Some of my best memories come from books.&nbsp; Whether reading an awesome book that really stuck with me afterwards, curling up in bed on a cold, rainy day and just reading or ignoring all the bitching at school and just reading to escape it.&nbsp; These people have missed out on that.&nbsp; Why is this a good thing? 

Even my brother who absolutely hates reading, with almost as much passion as I love it, has read books.&nbsp; Many of them.&nbsp; He even found an entire three series of books that he LOVES.&nbsp; Admittedly they're novels based on a computer game but hey, if it gets him to enjoy reading, who am I to argue?

Yes I have a strong bias here.&nbsp; I'm studying English at University.&nbsp; I will one day probably be an English/History teacher.&nbsp; I will probably end up getting my Masters and PHD in English.&nbsp; But surely if I'm willing to give up that much of my life to literature, there must be SOMETHING good about it?

Again I must ask: what's wrong with these people???"

I will eventually deck it out with all the trimmings and put up a complete bio and profile etc etc, but its almost 2am now... <br /><br />I don't know who is going to be reading this, but I'm so glad to finally have something to pour everything into. I think my friends might be glad that I've found something else at last. <br /><br />So I started this because I wanted to post on another journal and have to be a member, but I think I'll definitely use it to de-stress. Or whinge, as other usually call it.<br /><br />Oh and if anyone is reading this and can tell me how to change my font to verdana, I'd much appreciate it!</em></strong></font>"

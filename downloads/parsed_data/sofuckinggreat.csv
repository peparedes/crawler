today is a bummer.
i don't want to go to work.
i don't want to drive.
i don't really want to do anything but.. nothing.
i hate unsettling days. and unsettling movies. and feeling unsettled.
blah.
well hopefully by 5:30 i will be home and i will be able to relax until tomorrow.
now, food time.

(P.S. what all did you guys do for new years?? were you all in the springs and did you all get to hang out at Bri's like usual?? ahh, memories..)"

"event","crazy snowstorm, huh guys?
well i haven't done anything productive in the past 48+ hours. i've had wednesday, thursday, and today off of work because of the snow. pretty sweet. i wonder if i still get paid? hmm.. i do work for the city.. lol, i dunno. but it's been cool to just chill at home and not be too stressed out. 
i haven't done anything yet today. except for play Zelda. that's always fun. 
i really wish i could go christmas shopping before christmas. but i have a total of 16 dollars in my bank account right now. i got paid today, but i don't know if our paychecks even made it, because of the weather. yknow, with the mail and whatnot. i doubt they did, who knows. but i don't have a car at the moment anyway, because i let mike take mine to work. his got stuck in the snow the other day near work and he had to leave it there. bummer. sooo, anyway. i have no money, so i have to wait until after christmas to give away any presents. that sucks, christmas shopping is so fun. but that's ok. i've got a couple of good ideas for mike's presents for sure. now i just need moolah!
so, what else?
nothing really. just thinking.
i think that one day, when i realize that life is not a fairy tale, i will be able to let go of everything and not expect anything out of life, and it won't even bother me. i already know in my head that nothing is as it seems, and that nothing ever works out like you picture it, and that idealism is ridiculous when it comes to ANYTHING.. i know it in my head, and i've even experienced it, it just needs to click all the way. why it hasn't yet, i don't know. i suppose i'm just a hopeless optimist at heart.. it's really clashing with reality. maybe that's just the way my life is supposed to me. meh. who knows. 
well on the bright side... it's really pretty outside!!! i want to go make a snowman and a snow angel and a snow fort AND have a snowball fight!! ahhh! 
that sounds like fun. =)
but i don't have a whole lot of energy or enthusiasm to do much but sit right now, haha. what else is new? meh.
i need to take a nap. 
but i can't seem to sleeeeeeep. dammit. 
so.. i think that means more Zelda.. yay!"

"event","well well well. 
i have nothing to talk about.
but do i ever, really? nope. 
it was cool to see people this weekend. but this weekend was terrible. oh well. it's over now. 
bri, and rachel, and mime, when am i going to see you guys?!?
anyway, it felt weird being home. I felt like i was welcome there, but i didn't belong there. my mom has repainted my room, and changed all the furniture, etc.. it just doesn't feel like my home anymore; it felt pretty awkward being down there. but it still feels sort of awkward being up here too. i feel like i'm just a drifter now.. but i suppose i have always felt like that. when i moved to minnesota, felt like an out of towner, and when i moved back to colorado, i still felt like a minnesotan. now when i'm in denver, i still feel like i'm from the springs, but when i'm in the springs, i feel like i'm from denver. 
i guess it's just another continuation of feeling like i don't fit in anywhere, with anyone. you'd think i'd have gotten used to it by now, but i suppose not. 
well on the plus side i guess now i will not feel homesick anymore, because i'm not sure which home i'm supposed to feel sick to.
i hate this time of year. i love christmas and everything, but it is sort of a drag. i always feel like i'm waiting for something. there's always a feeling of anticipation for some event that never does come, but i keep waiting for it anyway. 
now i guess i am looking forward to making it to the summer with the job i have now. we'll see if i can do it, because we all know i'm a lazy bastard and i tend to give up on things as soon as i achieve them. i don't really know what the deal is with that. i have done it with nearly everything i've gained. i more or less dropped out of CC, when looking back i know i could've graduated if i wanted to. i quit my last job, when i know i probably should've just stuck it out and stayed there for the money. i have friends that were good friends but i don't really try to talk to them anymore. i guess i never really expected to get as far as i did. like, i didn't expect to get into CC. i really wanted to, and i did everything i could to achieve that, and i did. and then i gave up afterwards. same with target; i didn't really expect to get hired, but i really wanted to anyway so i tried really hard and i did get hired. and then i gave up on that also. weird. i guess all these things that i keep giving up on never seem to make me content like i think they will. none of the jobs i've had, and i know i can find something better and something that actually interests me and is what i want to do forever, but i guess i just keep settling for things i don't really want. so now it is my goal to actually stay in school and get the credits and classes that i need to get the degree i want, so that i can get the career i've always wanted. i know i can do it.. i just don't really get why i haven't done it yet. 
well at least there is one thing that i have not given up on yet. and i don't want to, although it is stressful. i guess it is just odd how once you find something, and then you take a minute away, you really realize that that is the only place you want to be and that is the only thing that makes you very happy. everything else in comparasion is just mediocre. that is what i felt like this weekend without mike. 
well, enough rambling. 
i think i'm going to go stuff my face or something. 
i should go on a diet. 
only because we just bought a ton of groceries, and i'm such a fat kid, that they are disappearing too quickly. 
maybe if i didn't stuff my face every two seconds, i'd have some money for once, haha. oh well."

"event","long time, no write. again.
i was gonna try to write more this time, but I have to go back to work soon, and I don't have very much energy at the moment. 
but I am planning on going down to the springs for Sarah's birthday this weekend, so maybe I will be able to run into some of you. yay. =)
anyway.
this week needs to hurry up and be over. it has been relatively lame. not too terrible though. work isn't that bad, just the drive. and some of the girls that are there are bitchy. maybe one day I will find a suitable job. not likely though. and at least now i'm getting paid for doing practically nothing instead of working my ass off. so that's good I guess. I'm still too poor though. oh well. 
hmm, what else.. I dunno. nothing really. 
life is life. just keeping myself distracted when there is nothing going on until there is something going on. 
it just drives me crazy how nothing is really ever how it seems. what is up with that? yknow I never thought I could be more disillusioned then I already was. that is an accomplishment in itself. I just hate living life moment to moment, with states of detachment scattered in between. I guess I will just have to figure that out. maybe someday, I obviously have not so far. 
well. stupid work calls. ugh. it's not even going to work that I dislike. I've come to realize that work is a good distraction to have, and it feels like lately i'm in need of distraction for sure. there are too many unsettling things to consider at any given time, and to consider them all at the same time would most definitely be disastrous. 
anyway, stupid work is still calling, so I'm off.  
man, hopefully the next time I write anything (which will be soon) it will be a little less retarded. I don't even know what i'm talking about. I know I usually babble, but it is usually at least a little poetic and decent. 
guess I just have to get back into the swing of it."

well, technically yesterday.
he sure was an amazing person.
and i sure do love the beatles. 
so in memory, i listened to them today. well.. more like all of two songs, until i realized that all the rest of them were deleted. *growls* lame. i'll have to fix that..
among the beatles, and other things, i really like this band silverstein.
and i also really like work.
can you believe it? i actually had FUN at work today. fun. huh. go figure. Mike is pretty much the best boss ever, i think. it's a really great job, and i really enjoy it there. i actually really hope i can stay after the holidays. really. hmm, suncoast. who would've thunk it. i even caught myself humming whilst alphabetizing the cds..
next on the order of business.. i have no idea.
i just crapped out an essay, and i need to finish memorizing the forty lines of poem-y goodness that i am to recite in class tomorrow. oh joy. i'm so excited. i guess i don't much care about the actual recitation, as long as i have it memorized enough to where i only fumble a bit. complete blank outs are scary. 
hm. speaking of blanking out, i'm drawing a blank about what to say. i guess all the studying/working plus the lack of sleep is starting to have it's effect.
hm..
everyone is pretty much on my wonderful awesome great lovely list as of now. except for certain fuckers who are fuckers who always fucking manage to take my friendship for granted and then throw a hissy fit and get offended when i decide to take it away because of it's failure to be appreciated.. but what else am i supposed to do? leave it there and watch it get misued? naw, eff that. but it's alright actually. even though i'm making it sound bad, i'm actually getting over it. mostly because i still have good friends who ARE good friends, a good job, and a good class, and a good mom, and a good outlook on the future, and a boy whom i'm sort of thinking about, which is good..
so generally speaking, i'm pretty good. 
eh, sorry, this entry sucked like a vacuum.
i'll try harder next time."

"event","i'm trying to finish my homework.
really, i am.
i've gotten my focus time up to 10 minutes strait now. 
obviously, this isn't part of a 10 minute focus block, though.
ugh, i just have so much left to do..
feh.
in between 10 minute focus blocks i made cookies, and spaghetti.
needless to say, i feel slightly sick to my stomach now. 
today was sort of a crap-ass day. 
i did that think where i go back to bed, wake up, and start the day over completely.
that is probably part of the reason why i have so much homework left, heh.
i was driving today, and my music was sort of loud i guess. i didn't hear the fire truck coming.
*rolls eyes*
i'm a terrible driver. i was even looking right at it. thinking, of all things, ""huh, what pretty colors those flashing lights are!"" then i looked at the car in front of me, wondering why it was pulled over to the side. then i wondered how i was going to fit between the pulled-over car, and the big thing coming down the other side of the road with the flashing lights.. THAT was when it all clicked.
honestly, i think they should make sirens a bit louder. my music wasn't even as loud as it usually was. pfft.
i think i also almost ran a van off of the road too. but come on, how was i supposed to know he was making a U-turn?? granted, i probably should've turning in the right lane to begin with, buuut.. 
well, at least i didn't get honked at. or maybe i did. my music was rather loud, i might've not heard it..
i don't think i should drive while i'm so distracted anymore. although amusing, sort of dangerous..
i ended up going past billy's house. i contemplated stopping by just to say hi, but then i remembered. 
i wonder how much longer this is going to bother me? probably forever. things always bother me forever. oh well. i don't want this to bother me forever though. it's really not worth my time.
i haven't talked to sarah gunty in forever. i wish she'd calleth me back. actually, she could've called. i guess i wouldn't know because i have no idea WHERE my phone is at the moment..
i have such a headache. one this one side of my head. i think i'm getting sick. hoo-rah. 
all i would really like to do is go to bed. precious, precious bed. without having to wake up at the ass-crack of dawn for school. 
however, i cannot do that until my homework is done.
so i suppose i should get back to it.
oh damn, tomorrow is monday. i hate mondays. absolutely.
i hope it rains.
i bet it's sunny though.
i bet i get a sunburn."

"event","a week or so ago, i was washing my hands in the bathroom during a break from class. 
oh, the things one overhears in the bathroom.
i am <u>such</u> a virgin compared to the girls in my class. which isn't saying too terribly much.
...and i thought those CC kids had morals.
silly sex-starved kids.
anyway, my point is that.. 
well, here's the thing. girls, the majority of girls, are never as they seem. 
i was thinking about it today while watching the happy couples around campus.
girls say they want someone sensitive. someone caring. an all around <u>nice guy</u>.
it is so untrue. 
i mean, it's true. in theory. it's true idealistically.
but it's really not true.
because all those girls that i've heard so adamantly state that they want a nice guy.. never ever end up with one. ever. one minute they're saying it, and the next they're making out with the stupid rebel kid.
it really does baffle me.
i mean.. it really does.
one minute i'm sitting in class with these girls and they are going on and on about their definition of love, and this and that, with stars in the eyes, and pure smiles on their faces.. 
and the two seconds later in the bathroom they are going into details about how they ""haven't gotten any in so long, and they are REAAAAAALY in need of some sexxxxxxxahhhhh.."" and so forth.
i just don't get it.
oh well.
i guess it doesn't matter.. no one is ever as they seem. in a way. 

i am so ready for a change. in a way.
i hate change. it's uncomfortable.
but i'm ready for one.
i want.. to be.. well, not just happy, but CONTENT.
and not just content some of the time, but ALL of the time.
i want to be with someone who will make me feel content all of the time.
someone who's layers of pride i don't have to dig through.
someone who can sit around and do NOTHING, and be fine with it.
someone who.. i can't really even explain. but. i have the picture in my head. or more importantly, i have the feeling. 
honestly, sometimes i feel like i am the only girl who sticks to her ideals.
maybe that is just naive. 
maybe THEY have all figured out that there is no such thing as a nice guy, therefore, might as well go for the bad one. or something. 
maybe i haven't figured that one out yet.
but.. it doesn't matter.
i'm still sticking to my ideals. 
girls are sooooo retarded..
anyway.

i am now off to watch degrassi. sweeet. better watching dumb girls on tv than in real life. that way you can always just say ""hey, it's only tv..""
i hope this weekend doesn't suck.
i wanna hang out.
but there isn't anyone to hang out with. or anything to do. *shrugs*
oh well."

when you are reading me your poems, and telling me which direction is which, and singing me your songs..

nothing more than telling me that up is down.
nothing.

feh. just felt like writing. er, did i say writing? i meant shitting from my brain. i like to shit from my brain.

i do enjoy being a bad kid. granted, it's not AS fun as when we used to do it. but that might just be because sarah gunty isn't here. she is my partner in crime, after all. my best buddy. speaking of her, i talked to her tonight, and i've pretty much decided that if i wasn't a girl, or if she wasn't a girl, we'd have to get married. i love her.

whoa..
crazy dude. 
that explains it. pretty much.
WHOA.. that's so insane. it's exactly the same.. except it's SO different. somehow. i just went back and looked at all those old blogs and i could see the difference. huh. i can see it, but i can't explain it. it's just different. everything feels.. different lately because i've realized how <i>the same</i> it is. it's just.. a feeling. a feeling of not being stuck on the inside anymore. more like, looking back from the outside. and now i'm not like how i used to be. i'm not.. involved. i'm not in the middle. i'm detached and distanced far enough away. so it's like i'm not there anymore.. but i'm still there. its better. its so much better. it's just getting to that point that's hard. i'm afraid i'm going to fall and slip back.. but i can't. i really can't because this time i don't WANT to. and i can see that it's no good. and even if that changed somehow, i still couldn't because i've already took a step too far in the other direction. and i'm glad i did. no invisible strings pulling me back this time. sarah gunty would be proud of me.
and when i went back and looked over those blogs, they made me sad. but not because i felt the same way. it really was like i was just an outsider observing a random person and feeling sorry for their situation. for once it's not my situation anymore. it's like i'm finally, FINALLY just.. done. not like all the other times i was ""done"". done as in free. finally. 
i kind of love it.
i kinda feel like celebrating. 
i did watch Empire Records tonight. that was pretty sweet. ive decided that i really want to marry mark. and eddie. and lucas too. that would be awesome.
man, everything is just so.. strange kind of. and different. i don't even know what to think. but at least i do know that it's making me more positive again. it's making me happier. 
i am finally getting back to happiness again..

on a completely different note, since it's block break, i brought Brautigan home today. i luff him. he's the coolest mouse in the world. he talks too. i swear to god, he talks to me. he rocks so hard. good old Brautigan. sometimes i call him Brauty. or Bratwurst."

"event","no really, it is.
i love it. especially when they don't even realize that you're doing it.
it's sneaky.
sometimes i refuse to speak a word in class. its fun. i just do it sometimes to see if i can get to people. the other day my professor threatened to start ""calling on people"" if we didn't start talking. mainly he was referring to me and the girl sitting next to me. i just smiled at him. and i think i might've chucked a bit, too. it's just funny. i could probably speak perfectly fine if i so wanted to. i could participate in class discussions with the best of them. i just choose not to. and sometimes, after nearly a month of not saying a word, its fun to out of nowhere start rambling. going on and on and on. it really surprises people. it's really great to see the looks on their faces.
yeah, surprising people out of the blue is pretty great sometimes. but you have to do it right. it takes precision. i did it last week. actually, i even took myself by surprise with THAT one, hah.. reactions are the greatest. especially if someone has no idea how to react. those are the best.
i love pulling shit. but without anyone knowing i'm pulling it.
yesterday i bought food from the little cafe as usual, for lunch. the lady at the counter was nice. she asked me how my class went. i proceeded to tell her what she asked.. along with every other detail she could've ever wanted to hear. it was pretty great.
its so great pulling the rug out from underneath people sometimes. 
i like to fuck around. 
i bet no one knew that though, huh? probably not.
see, my spontaneity is a secret. because it can be REALLY dangerous when let loose. 
that's why you hardly ever see it.
however, i've been bored to past week, so i've had to entertain myself somehow. and once i get on a fucking around with people spree, it's hard to stop. i really had to refrain from doing anything when ella was talking in class the other day. she was talking about this musician she was really into. she said he was ""amazing"" and ""totally underground"" and ""is bound to be the next paul simon"". i started hacking, then excused myself, claiming i had just caught a headcold. probably from holding my mouse too close to my face earlier that day. it's too bad i had to pass that one up. 
yeah, fucking with people is just too fun sometimes. i enjoy it. all in good fun, of course.
it should make for an interesting weekend.."

so today has been.. ehh. whatever. i've at least enjoyed the cloudiness.
i shat out that paper on daoism this morning. no matter how hard it try, i always end up doing papers the morning they're due. oh well. i liked it, at least. which means i bet my professor hates it. haha. 
so today, i feel like i could write a million poems, and paint a mural, or record an entire album. but i just can't seem to get the motivation for any of the above. oh well, maybe tomorrow.
it's funny, i feel so free. haha, i feel like spinning around in a field of poppies or something, singing ""la-la-la"" to the sun. isn't that a funny picture? i feel so free, but i have no idea what to do with it. it feels so weird when you let go to things. it's like there's nothing to be attached to anymore, there's nothing to think about anymore, you almost don't know what to do with yourself.
so i don't know what to do with myself today. 
i'm sure i'll find something.. or someone.. to do. >_<

"event","i wish people would stop writing offensive things on my whiteboard. especially in response to the comments sarah and bri left me. those comments made me happy, and then someone from my hall had to go and poo all over it..
but whatever. i hate them all anyway, and i KNOW they hate me. and i really couldn't care less..
i had to go to a luncheon today with a bunch of old ladies, and with a big fake smile plastered all over my face, kindly and graciously thank them from paying for me to attend a college that i really rather not be attending..
if there's one thing i'm learning from this school, it is how to successfully be insincere. i've gotten so good at it.
i got called on in class today. the professor made the rounds on the ""people who he hadn't heard from today"" and of COURSE i was in that category. i love that. no matter though. i answered honestly, and i made the entire class laugh, and it was fine. it's nice to know that at least i can still be myself to some extent and not give a shit about what other people think. 
all this buddhism stuff is very intersting too. but i think i've decided that i could never be a buddhist. it's not my cup of tea. i'd sooner become a born-again christian, i think. it's closer to my value system. ...and that has to be the about the more bizzare thing i've ever said. i don't know how i feel about that. 
anyway, that concludes anything i have to say about school.
onto a completely different topic..
in sitting here, and surfing through myspace and seeing certain pages and feeling inclined to leave insincere comments, i finally realized it. i just hit me. 
i know EXACTLY why i do it now. i know exactly why i stay friends with the people i don't really want to be friends with.. it's really quite interesting. however, it's a startling truth, and i don't want to say it here.. but if you ever want to know, you can ask me again. and if you ask me again, this time i will be able to give you an answer. then maybe you will be able to understand me, and i will be able to understand me as well..
speaking of understanding things, after reading another ENTIRE book last night, i came to this absolutely insane.. not so much a realization, but a thought. it was so extreme, that i literally had to just sit back, and take a deep breath, and then just FORGET about it, so that i could actually get back to work without having my entire perceptions of life crumble at my feet. it was that insane. and once again, i don't want to say it here, but i will say one this lest i forget what this insane thought was. ""what if nothing exists?"" or not so much what if nothing exists, but.. ""what if major explanations of life, i.e. religion, exist ONLY in the realm of YOUR life and no one else's for only YOUR purpose?""
this religion class has really been tearing at my head. for once i feel like there's things i can't comprehend. it's insane. 
anyway, i don't want to talk about that right now either. although it would be nice to one of these days. it would be nice to have a nice discussion about things. but alas, we are not sitting out on the philosophy swing right now, so another time perhaps.
well now.. now i am stuck.
i've figured out..
there are these phases. that always occur. with me. as of now, that is. i don't know where they start or begin, so i'll just have to start with what i can think of, which is where i am right now. limbo, more or less. waiting to see.. what's going to happen next. this limbo is always provoked by something that i say or do or imply, etc.. the next phase is what pulls me out of this limbo. lately, and usually, it has been reality. i wait, in hope, to be pulled out of limbo with something good, something positive. but usually it is something negative, and my hopes are dashed by reality. the next phase is good old despair and self-wallowing. the worst phase by far. realizing that what you want is something that you can't have. and being stuck, sitting and thinking, with that idea. but then something has to pull me out of that. i'm not sure what it is. lately i <i>think</i> it has tended to be a conversation of some sort, that gives rise to a feeling. an inkling in the back of my mind that maybe the hope that was dashed.. wasn't dashed completely. maybe there is a little left after all. which brings forth the next phase, which is that provocation.. that thing that i do or say, in order to push that hope and faith and see if it is actually there. next comes limbo again..
thus is the circle of my life. isn't it wonderful..
so i'm just a-sittin and waiting in limbo right now. and i've gotta say that it's probably the best place to be at for my frame of mind. because it's the place where hope lives, i guess. it's the closest you can possibly get to getting what you want.. it's the furthest you can stand out on the ledge of a cliff to see the beautiful view, without falling of the edge..
and i want to stay here as long as possible. but at the same time, that hope that pulls at the back of my brain tells me that i don't want to stay here, because what could happen next? it could be the greatest thing in the world. but, in my experience, my limbo has never succeeded in achieveing that which i want. so this time.. this time i'm going to appreciate my limbo, my hopes of hearing what i want to hear, getting what i want to get, to the fullest. because i know my next phase is just gonna.. suck..

anyway. enough of that. i can't wait till this weekend. the weekends make me happy because there is usually a chance that i will be able to see certain people, and that makes me happy. during the weekdays there is less of a chance of that. so that is why i look forward to them. 
only 3 more days..  

oh PS. i'm sure i completely baffle some of you guys. as it has been brought to my attention, my entries are kind of.. crazy. i don't really use this journal to document the everyday happenings of my life so much as to get out whats in my head. i don't much use it to communicate to others either (well, that's not true, i do.. but not in a way you'd suspect.) so i must insist that you don't boggle your mind trying to understand them or anything. i doubt anyone would or could ever be able to, unless they were as crazy as i am.. those unfortunate few, lol.. anyway, don't take it personally either. it's just me trying to work through my own thoughts and make sense of them outside of my head."

"event","class today made me want to cry.
we watched this movie on the lives of buddhist monks in sri lanka. at the end there was seriously 10 minutes of this monk just walking around, <i>really</i> slowly. and the camera kept taking shots of his feet, and then of the back of his head, and then of his feet again. 
it was so painfully boring that i wanted to cry.
the kid who i was sitting across from in class wore rather short shorts, and he kept sitting in really unflattering positions. he kept stretching and his shirt kept going up, and i just saw entirely too much of him in the span of an hour and a half.
he was so gross that i wanted to cry.
and the other kid i was sitting across from was wearing sandals, and had the <b>gnarliest</b> feet i've ever seen. his toenails were really dirty, and in need of a good clipping. and he had really unsightly warts, one on each big toe. 
looking at his gnarly feet really made me want to cry.
class was just not good today. mondays never are.
i was entirely too tired, and too restless, and too much inside my own head to pay attention to a word that was said. 
but i did learn one thing, at least. we were discussing buddhism and past lives and whatnot, and the teacher repeated some saying that he'd heard:
<U>if you want to know about your past lives, look at your physical life now. if you want to know about your future lives, examine your thoughts and mentality.</u>
i thought that was really cool, and made a lot of sense.

today i didn't feel like getting a ride home after class so i walked all the way home. it was nice. despite how much i hate physical activity. it was a good 45 minute walk. mostly uphill. but i'm proud of myself for doing it. 

on the way home, i walked past that catholic school. the little kids were outside for recess. it was a really interesting sight to see. it just made me think about things. i haven't been in the presence of children in a really long time. in a way, i think it's sort of important to help you gain another sort of perspective on your life. not necessarily a good one, just a different one. 

well. this weekend, in general, was terrible. i do not have particularly high hopes for this week. i guess i will have to see what happens. i guess i will have to do the best that i can. speaking of which, there was one more thing that i remember from class today. we were talking about the impermanence of happiness. when you are happy, there sometimes lingers in the back of your mind the thought that the happiness will end. this is probably 95% of the reason why i am never really happy. other people too, i suppose. but then, there's the flip side. when you are unhappy, there should also be the lingering thought in the back of your mind that, just as your happiness is impermanent, so shall be your unhappiness. 
maybe that is why i prefer to live an unhappy state sometimes. because there is always the hope that there is happiness to come. 
buuut lets not get into that now. or ever."

"event","yesterday i met <i>the one</i>. 
the one i'm going to marry. 
that special one.. of my dreams..
i'm telling you. 
i was just walking around campus, looking to get some food or something.
i stopped in the coffee shop.. and there he was.
it was just.. wow. 
his black hair did that.. that <i>thing</i> that scene hair does.
and he had happy converse shoes on.
and he was pretty much as skinny as a railing.
and it was just.. the most.. amazing thing ever.
i mean.. god..
but..
that wasn't <i>the one</i>.. oh no.
heavens no.
because then i went up to the counter, bought a chai tea, took a sip..
and from that day forth i became known as mrs. emily chai tea.
that's right. i never even took a glimpse back at that scene boy.
because i fell in love with the chai..

ok so, the point of that retarded story was that i had a really awesome chai tea at the coffeehouse the other day. it was unbelievably yummy. best thing ever. *drools* ..and no, there was no scene boy. i completely made that up. for emphasis. boys don't exist at this school. at least not ones that don't wear sandals and play frisbee. and who wants that? pfft."

"event","why do we want what we can't have? why do we have what we don't want.. what we want and what we get are two very dfferent things. we never get what we want, because we project a preconceived illusion of what it is we <u>think</u> we want. how exactly it will be when we get it is completely different than what it actually is when we do get it. ..what you dream is not what is.. it can never be what is, because dreams are nothing short of a well thought-out illusion. you can never have what you want, because what you want is a false reality.. a false reality that only exists in your mind..
i'm stuck in this illusion, this false reality. but i don't want anyone to pull me out. because somewhere.. in the back of my mind.. i know i can have what i want. because i can see what i want for what it really is. and i didn't know i wanted it until i saw it. well now, there is it, just out of reach.. maybe if it would just move a little bit closer i would be able to have it..
why won't you let me have it?

"event","i don't know what to write.
this is an awkward time to be awake, i suppose.
i just woke up from this really long, really detailed dream. it was interesting..
anyway. there's these two things that i love.
i love it when i'm sitting in class, and i realize how strongly the discussion relates to my life. i love it when i can relate to something. and it's kind of like it always happens right when i need to remember that things happen for a reason, too. i love that. today we had a 30 minute discussion about love, why we accept it, why we don't, definitions, what it means.. i thought there were two really good definitions mentioned. one was something to the effect of accepting someone completely, and the other was having the deep consideration for someone else's well-being and having a general concern for their achievement of happiness. those definitions made me not scowl at the word ""love"" for once. which brings me to the second thing..
i also love it when you find the perfect thought. when you have the idea of something completely perfect, some idea of happiness, and just the thought alone can almost sustain you. no matter what. i love the feeling of being entirely lost in that perfect idea of happiness. and i love the thought of the possibility that it could become reality. even if the possibility is 1% plausible.. the thought is nice. and sometimes it can keep you going through the worst times. and it doesn't make you entirely HAPPY to think about it.. it's more of a mixture of feeing content, and thoughtful, pensive, and sad.. but happy? it's odd. but i pretty much love it.."

"event","i wish it could be my birthday everyday. it's like you have magical powers on your birthday or something. i dunno. it just feels like nothing can go wrong.. even though it very well can actually. but it just feels like it can't.
anyway. today i woke up to three consequetive texts from rachel, bri, and mime.. one right after another. did you guys plan that or something? that was so freakin cool. that made me happy, though. especially mime's simpsons reference, lol. no worries, mime, i seriously think that's the only birthday related simpsons quote. and i had that happy birthday song stuck in my head all day too, lol..
anyway. somehow a few people on my floor found out it was my birthday as well. they wrote me happy birthday notes on my little white board on my door. that was really nice.. and then the lunch lady as she swiped my food card also wished me happy birthday. how amusing..
i didn't do much today, though. went out to dinner with my mom. she gave me a card and a little desert thing, and 25 dollars. that's about it. i kind of wanted to.. i dunno.. go out and do something with someone though. but i haven't even seen anyone today. and no one is really here to do much with.. when i woke up i was kind of like ""wow, i'm 19 today! what can i do?? ..oh, nothing really."" lol. oh well. this weekend is going to be good. oh! and sunday. i'm really excited for sunday now..
*sigh* well. 
i'm tired. it's been a long.. interesting day. it kinda sucks that it's over. back to reality. but that's okay i guess."

she stopped thinking about boys who weren't there...

she stopped thinking that she was lucky.

she stopped trying. 
she realized that everyone was right..

and that <b><i>she</i></b> really was much prettier and that's why all the guys liked her.
and that <b><i>he</i></b> would never ever take notice. ever.

this is definitely the earliest i've been up in a loooong time..

so.
i wonder what today will be like?
huh. i wonder if people think that often when they wake up? usually i guess people just assume that their day will be good because of this, or bad because of that. but.. if the day has just started, i suppose you can't really know. anything could happen.
well, i hope it is at least a good day.

do you ever read other people's journals and like.. want to be them? it's kind of hard to explain.
i read someone's journal today. 
someone that i don't know very well.
but well enough to know how fucked up their life is.
that's why i wouldn't really want to <i>be</i> them.
but the way they wrote made me wish that i was.. like them. 
somehow.
the way they documented their every day life made me wish that i could do the same in some way.
the way they spoke about things that didn't really matter. but no matter how miniscule, the fact that these things happened kind of made them matter anyway.
it just.. made me want to be like them.
but.. they had something. something important. maybe they knew it, maybe they didn't. but they ended up losing it. 
and that's so sad, because they have <i>no idea</i> what they <b>really</b> lost. no idea. 
that's what makes me <i>really</i> not want to be them.

..i hate how my pronouns never agree in number. i know i should use ""he/she"" instead of ""them"". but i can never bring myself to do it. so much for majoring in english. i can't bring myself to capitalize the word <i>english</i> either..

i found that mood that i get in sometimes. 
that type of mood when you feel crappy, and sarcastic, and shitty and horrible, but witty.. and somehow that makes it ok. 
i found it.
see, cause i was just now making up a bunch of playlists and whatnot. and i have one entitled ""bad day"". and i was browsing through my songs, finding ones that would fit on the playlist. then i came across it. THE PERFECT song, with THE PERFECT line..
Pinch Me. Barenaked Ladies.
oh, i found it.

<b><i>""i feel fine enough i guess, considering everything's a mess.""</i></b>

that's it, that it right there. that's the line. that's the mood. sorta wordy, but it works.

"event","i feel the need to babble.. and my LJ is starting to get a bit clogged.
so here i am.

i am so weird.
i listen to the weirdest music sometimes. just two seconds ago, i was bobbing around to Frank Sinatra of all things..
i say the weirdest things ever. not too long ago, this came out of my mouth:
""oh man, i'm really bored. hmm, i think i'll go conjugate some latin verbs..""
really, what is that??
most of all, i do the weirdest things. like, the other day, whilst making a bowl of cereal, this little ditty popped into my head. ..the end result was me belting out a 20 minute opera of the Milk & Cereal song. and yes, there was a dance to accompany it, too. 
i am weird.
but.. i suppose i'm okay with it. 
if you aren't weird, then you are boring.

onto another topic..
relationships are strange.
i was thinking about this the other day.
every single relationship you have with someone is completely different from the next. 
my friendship with sarah gunty is completely different than my friendship with billy. even though i consider both of them to be very close, best friends of mine.. it's too completely different situations. isn't that strange? you act different with every person you know. you say different things to each of them to make them feel better if they're sad, or to get under their skin, or to tell them they're wrong about something, or to congratulate them. and each relationship means something entirely different. with some people, i have completely serious relationships. with others, it's strictly a ""go out and have fun"" and nothing more type of friendship. with some people it's both. some people i can joke around with. some people i can taunt ruthlessly. some people are there to sit in comfortable silence with. with others, talking is a necessity. some people i can sit around with for hours with doing absolutely nothing. with other people, it's go out or get out. some people are for boy talk. some people are for gossip. some people are for deep discussions. some people i can be completely carefree and goofy and ""fuck the world"" with. with others, it's strictly pleasantries. some people are smoking buddies, some are drinking buddies, some are work buddies, some are music buddies.. the list goes on and on. but the best, BEST thing ever, is when one person is ALL of those things. that's sweet.

so.
what else is there to ramble about?
i don't know.
i don't much feel like rambling anymore.
i do feel like making some mixtapes though.
jesus, mixtapes are so wonderful.."

that was the most fucking fun ever! oh, that was wonderful..
among the list of other wonderful things, justin from motion city soundtrack is up there. i sure wish i could marry him. because he is that brilliant. good god.
annnnd what else? the word mojito. MOJITO. i wish i had a mojito right now. that would be glorious. 
and to sum up the list of greatness, there is billy who, in the midst of peril, bravely and triumphantly returned my mood ring. wonderful. absolutely wonderful. i love billy, he's the best. in the west. and east. ..and all the other cardinal directions as well.

so anyway, that was alot of ramble and whatnot. the general gist: today was delightful. :)
i'm on the verge of being sarcastically bitter again right now. but really, i'm not in the mood. well that's not true, i just haven't got the energy. maybe tomorrow. it's the strangest feeling though. like one second i'm in complete bliss because i'm just thinking about justin's brilliance and the word MOJITO and everything. and the next minute, i'm wishing long and painful deaths upon people. but in a upbeat sort of way. it's really peculiar. *shrugs* i don't get it.

i hate waking up knowing there's a whole day of absolutely NOTHING in front of me. it makes me feel so empty and whatnot. bleh.
i don't know how i've managed to make it through the day so far. i think it was mindlessly staring at the tv/dosing.
only a few more days until august. thank GOD. maybe.. maybe august will just suck too. oh god, i hope not though.
now i am about to go put some cookies in the oven. then i shall eat them while watching a lifetime movie on tv. fun fun. oh! a lifetime movie that i've already SEEN at that. absolutely pathetic.
we really don't have any food around here, either. and my mom doesn't get paid until tomorrow, which is a good thing. but that's why there has been no food in this house. because she's been bopping around for two weeks with NO CASH, which i didn't know. and for some reason i find that unsettling. :/ we're really lacking in the funds lately, which sucks. which is another reason that i need to get a job. i was wondering where my allowance went lately.. 
anyway. 
it's also unsettling to be sitting at home at 8 oclock. but i don't really want to go out and do anything with anyone. well i do.. but i don't. hard to explain. people aren't on the top of my list at the moment. they all suuuuuck.
but cookies don't.
so i'm going to go make some."

ahh, what a lovely song indeed. i kind of would like to write something right now, but i think i am too tired. i really need to go to bed. but we all know that's not gonna happen. 
so lately.
i just don't know.
i don't even know where to start.
i wonder if people ever get sick of my silly questions.
but what's the point of life if you don't ask silly questions? no point, i think.
well this is all very quickly going down the drain..
so i'll just stop here and save us all a little sanity i suppose.
until tomorrow for some.
and sunday for others.
and god knows when for the rest."

"event","i can't wait until this summer is over. i wish it would go faster. i hate saying that.. summer is usually the best thing ever. considering how much i loathe school. but seriously.. i'd pick school over this summer any day.
anyway.
i didn't get up until about 5pm today. being conscious just wasn't in the plan for today i suppose. i am cranky as ever. it's coming from every single direction, and i really wish it would just go away. but i can't seem to accomplish that. so this naseated feeling is just kind of lingering and i don't like it. well, the only thing i can say is that maybe tomorrow will be better. 
one thing that does make me happy though, is writing. so i'm considering going to the park right now to write. i don't know if i can get the energy i need for that.. but i can try. it's nice when you're feeling sickening bitter and whatnot, to start writing things. for me, it turns my bitterness into this sarcastically witty ""even though things aren't ok, they kinda are"" sorta mood. that's better than being just plain bitter and upset, i suppose.
and also, sarah and i are going to hit the hookah bar pretty soon. so that will be cool. 
well, i'm outta here.
i can't stand this room any longer."

"event","<Center><i><b>Hey, that's not right
you can't complain
<u>""everything's gonna be just fine""</u>
said the pen to the dotted line..
If memory serves, then mark my words
this game's called ""catch me if you can""
and with wine we'll salute all our <u>bitterness.</u></b></i></center>

<i>Commit this to memory..</i> 
There's this hypothetical question that keeps popping out of nowhere.
""Now what?""
It's only hypothetical because no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to answer it. ..I think that's called cheating, though.
And then there's this creeping feeling at the pit of my stomach that manages to find its way to the back of my throat and I realize that it's me wanting ever so badly to throw up at the very sight of your wonderfully bright and shining face.
That happens sometimes. 
Pure disgust is quite the motivator.
But I wouldn't want to ruin anyone's shoes, so I'll choose to stare at the floor, lest the aforementioned disgust take over and leave us all in a big mess of vomit.
And then there's this nagging in the back of my mind moaning and groaning about mea culpa and whatnot. Something like that.
..but that's just silly. Those autographs and apologies get you nowhere sometimes. now a canoe, however.. a canoe can get you places. you'd better believe it.

Those are the thoughts for brooding over at the moment.

You will have to excuse me if I am unable to feel too horribly sorry for anyone at this particular point in time. I'm getting slightly nauseous just imagining it. And pardon the bitterness, but I do believe I possess very little savoir-faire often enough.
I'm pretty positive it's an imaginary thing. 
Just like the boogeyman, or tooth fairy, or that look on my face when I'll say dont worry, everything is just fine, so <i>just forget it</i>!
oh jeez, i almost choked myself to death on that snort!
..oops, there's that sneaky rancor again. it just comes out of nowhere, doesn't it?
Really though, beg pardon, but could you point me in the direction of the past? ..or if that's not available, then a packet of sugar <i>might</i> just do the trick."

"event","ughhhhhh.
god i feel like el-crap-o.
there is shit left and right that i just do want to think about or deal with. and there are people left and right who honestly do nothing but absolutely DISGUST me when i look at them. i just want to vomit, honest to god. 

i wish me and billy could've hung out more. :/ i really do. but oh well. maybe another time.

god, i am just so unsettled right now. people make me sick. people are so fucked up. and then other people are absolutely wonderful. and it really makes you wonder.. but it is not something i want to wonder about right now. at all. so i'm going to go watch my so called life and become imersed in someone else's dramatic life because i sure don't want to think about my own. 
i hope tomorrow is a good day.
<i>please</i> let tomorrow be a good day.."

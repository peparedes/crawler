"event","So <lj user=""b_halle""/> kept begging me to come out to LA to see her, and well, how could I refuse?! So, here I am in LA, jet-lagged like a muthaphucka, fortunately Halle stocked her house with so much alcohol I had to have vodka in my Lucky Charms this morning. So, everything is going nicely. We've been having so much fun. She picked me up from the airport all incognito, it was hot. Then she gave the guy the finger for almost hitting us. Needless to say I was turned on. California is really nice. I really want to go out and see more of the city, but with all the rain you kids have been having, it doesn't look like a safe idea, especially with the way people drive. So, me and Halle have opted to stay in our jammies and watch movies and get drunk and gossip about people. I would love to see some of you who live in LA. Hit me up and we can go out to dinner."

"event","I told someone I had a crush on them, but I don't think they believed me...and even if they did, I don't think they like me. I feel kinda down about it, because I don't think anyone takes me seriously. I mean, I joke around a lot and say silly things, but I really do have a sensitive side. I dunno. I'm gonna go in a corner and play my CLay AIken CD over and over...and then switch to Ruben, just so I can dance."

The song is called ""Next Stop Happiness"", obviously from the title you can only imagine how much of a classic that song is huh?! Ah well, it's all good. For the most part I just do what they tell me to do.


And big ups to fellow SOuth African Charlize Theron, please love me."

"event","Well, I am back in the ""S.A."", otherwise known as South Africa. I'm excited to be back, but I miss Hawaii. Mmmmm Hawaii. Phatty dreamy sigh to that! I actually learned how to surf, dispite my blood/alcohol content. <lj user=""kee_gan""/> told me that if I could surf without his help he'd come back with me to SA...and I did. Boom Bazooka Heinz! So pretty much everything was glorious and I kick ass.

As soon as I arrived home it has been work work work, drinking, work. They are releasing my single ""Next Stop Happiness"" in Germany in March and around the UK sometime soon as well. Speaking of Germany, Alexander came down to Cape Town and we had to hang out for the ""Idol"" cameras. It was weird to see him again, but strangely it wasn't akward. That's mostly due to the fact he was plastered out of his mind and has the attention span of a retarded squirrel. He was however, trying to get fresh with me and what not, as he always does, but I merely brushed him away. He for once finally got the point and backed off. He then asked me out to dinner which I said yes to. I mean, hello, it's a free meal. We went out to dinner and just talked about things and what not. If anything I believe that we could actually have a decent friendship. We'll see....

I miss Halle, someone tell her to love Heinz..NOW!

He has been such a sweetheart it's moving. I don't know what I'm gonna do when I have to go back to South Africa. Sadly we leave Thursday night. 

I don't know how mad <lj user=""b_halle""/> is gonna be when I say we have to postpone our trip. I am being overwhelmed at the moment with work and what not. It's crazy the life of us Idol winners. I can only imagine how busy <lj user=""clayton_aiken""/> and <lj user=""K_clarkson""/> are. Although I wish Kelly would stop being so hott and just make out with me. K Thanx.

"event","So <lj user=""b_halle""/> is forcing me to update and I must adhere to her request otherwise she's not gonna let me try on the infamous catsuit.

Anyways, <lj user=""kee_gan""/> and I barely made our flight to Hawaii, but alas here we are. It is so gorgeous I can see what all the fuss is about. We are on the Island called ""Kauai"" (I believe that's the spelling, but alas I drink a lot as well). It reminds me of home which makes me a little homesick, but that's when the alchy comes in. <lj user=""Kee_gan""/> is sleeping right now and he looks so peaceful. I contiplated drawing with a sharpie on his face, but then I remembered I liked him and he wouldn't like me if I did that. But alas, I gave him a mole. Whoops, I can't help myself.

<lj user=""b_halle""/> kept trying to seduce me into going on a vaca with her. At first I hesitated because I have been traveling so much when I really should be back home working on my upcoming tour. But then she sent me a picture of said cat suit and a bottle of vodka, and thus I agreed to a vaca immediately. She wants to go to Bermuda, so I'm all down for that. But seriously, after that I have to go home. You got that Halle! Stop trying to corrupt me.

It's also been decided that <lj user=""alex_james""/> shall be making all my future decisions. I'm already booked on what I'm doing until mid morning tomorrow. If you have any requests, just ask Alex, he is then gonna call me.

And that's that. I <3 Boom Bazooka Joe!"

"event","So my plane arrived in at 2 a.m. and he was there standing at the other end of the corridor with a sign, holding it up and grinning like the fool he is. So cute. He immediately asked how my flight was and went to go for my bags at the baggage claim. He is such a gentleman it's ridiculous. We get into his car and he takes me to this little all night cafe in LA. I've never been to LA before so seeing it for the first time was amazing. We went down the Sunset Strip and Melrose and he showed me the Capital records building. After dinner we went back to his place where I am currently. I was so tired from the plane ride, but I feel a lot better now. I can't wait until Hawaii. I promised <lj user=""b_halle""/> that I would bring her back a lei and lei her, although I think she just really wants to get into my pants and that was her way of making a funny pun.

Everything else has been going good. I harvest a huge secret of <lj user=""clayton_aiken""/>, and all I can say about it is ""Bring it!""

Tom Whelling turned down the position of being my decision maker, I hope he knows what a bad decision THAT was..

Alright kiddies see you in LA, and then in Hawaii....but I'll most likely be too drunk in Hawaii to remember if you were there too. Feel free to take advantage. I'm just kidding, I'm not THAT easy. I'm not Alexander for goodness sakes.

Also, good news, they are releasing my single in the UK and in the USA and I shall be touring in Feb. So, please feel free to become a fangirl if you so desired."

"event","So I bought him and I tickets to Hawaii. I haven't told him yet, but I had his ticket reservation emailed so he should find out soon. I hope I'm not moving too fast...but he seems like such a great guy, considering he doesn't treat me like crap like someone else we all know and dispise. Anyways, moving on. 

I bought a Brit-Rail pass and have just been touring around looking at everything and taking in as much as I can. I contiplated going to the Ministry of Sound, but fought my urges and decided to just stay in the hotel. It's nice to just sleep in as long as you can and not have to worry about waking up to do another pointless radio interview where they ask the same questions as the last person just did. It gets old and I don't want to become bitter and think I'm something I'm not and forget where I came from and who got me here.

However I cannot wait to find out if aforementioned person says yes to my Hawaii plan. We never really talked on where we should go, but I just thought that Hawaii would be a great place. I heard it's very beautiful and I cannot wait to just lay on the beach with a certain someone and drink ourseleves into oblivion while laughing and having a grand time. Now I sound like a crazed fangirl.

I leave for LA in 2 days, hopefully a special someone will pick me up from the airport.

And I think Will and Gareth have drinking problems...and by ""problems"" I mean ""they need to drink more often""

Millsy needs to stop being a pansy and update.

And for the love of all that is HOTT will <lj user=""tamyramonica""/> and <lj user=""k_clarkson""/> please update so I can see what's crack-a-lackin' with my wifeys.

And because <lj user=""kee_gan""/> kept pesturing me, I finally got AIM. it's ""HunkyHeinz"" and I'm sorry about that."

"event","....And the packing continues. Tomorrow I am leaving for a vacation to the United Kingdom. I need to get away and just fade into the background of the hussel and bussel of the city. (I don't believe I spelled that right, but I move on). Anyways, I hope that while I'm in the area I can sit down and talk with <i>the</i> <lj user=""Will_Young""/>. Maybe he can grant me some advice as to what to do with myself now. It's the weirdest feeling in the world to go from no one to being stared at where ever you go while people ask the infamous question ""is that so and so"" in their heads. I should be so lucky though to have the career that Will himself has had. I also hope to see all my sexy British ladies there as well, and they still feed the need to get me drunk and try to sex me up. What's up Hayley and Saz?! It should be a grand time and I look forward to it. I just hate the plane ride. Argh. I'm just gonna start drinking now.

Recently I have been feeling so lonely. I'm jealous of Billy and Ryan and what they got. However, although I am lonely sometimes at night, I do like this independence and I can finally talk to other people with a certain someone getting mad and thus creating a scene. However I haven't talked to Alexander in awhile so I believe he's doing good, and/or has finally started working the streets like the <s>whore</s> crazy guy he is.

So, I haven't talked to Alexander in a while. I think he must've gotten into one of his famous drunken stuubers and passed out in a gutter somewhere. Oh well, I'm over the whole thing and I'm completely detaching myself from him. That weird little german freak man whore. We had our fun, but I think it's time to move on and get going with my life.

I think I'm the only ""Idol"" with booking information on the FRONT page of their website. GO me! That pretty much means that with enough money you can book me for parties. I take off my shirt for an extra 10 and a shot of yager.

I need to get out and start traveling. I really want to visit London and the US. I'm probably gonna go to the US when Kelly and Clay are on tour so I can see them live. I really want to go to London so I can see <lj user=""Will_Young""/>, but he doesn't know that yet. I don't want him to think I'm a groupie or something.

"event","So Alexander said those three words again ""I hate you"". I really don't know why me and him play these little games with eachother. I think it's because deep down we really <s>just like having sex with eachother</s> love eachother, but don't want to admit it to the other person. Maybe one day we will, and maybe one day he won't be <s>such an asshole</s> so far away. It's not that I don't trust him, but let's be honest people, it's Alexander. He's a freaky german man whore. For god sakes he sang ""She's a maniac"" on World Idol <s>ah, the reason I fell in love</s>, so I always have doubts in my mind. I wish things could be easier but then I guess it wouldn't be as worth it. It's funny because I've had like 3 women propose to me this week on livejournal alone, not to mention the countless letters and thongs which are sent to me via fan mail, and I can't stop thinking about a german boy who pisses me off everychance he gets. Not to mention he steals the aformentioned thongs for god knows what reason. Woe is me. What am I to do?!

I've been so busy and hectic it seems like I'm not myself anymore, that I'm just this name and face that everyone loves. I wonder if anyone will ever love me and not ""Hunky Heinz"".

I also must apologize for me and Alexander....we just get punchy with eachother and try to see who can take it further, please pay no attention to him <s>besides, he's a man-whore</s> he's a silly guy.

I don't have much to write besides that, I'm just sitting here in an office while my management team is thinking up of ways to make more money off of me. And with the fan fare from World Idol I think they are trying to take me global.....great, now I have to learn how to sing."

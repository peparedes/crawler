"event","So as I wrote in my last entry..I'm really scared right now. Like, I was really okay with graduating for this entire school year...pretty much since September. I thought because school wasn't the raddest it could be, I just wanted to graduate. You know? But I suddenly freaked out on Easter. I was talking to my cousin about when she graduated. How sad she was..but how she got over it when she went to college. But friends and people aren't really what's bugging me. It's the fact that I spent 4 years not really doing anything but school. Like, I did track and basketball and newspaper, but I deeeeeeeeefintitely quit all that shit like the quiter I am. I didn't even really work hard enough to get into a good school like I wanted. My parents won't let me go to San Diego State, which is pretty much the school I most want to go to. I'm undeclared, because holy shit I have no idea what I want to be. My family thinks I'm stupid for not going into some kind of engineering or computer job (""it's the future, nikki""). Like, I don't really feel like I made the impact I would like to have at El Dorado. Holy fuck dude, it's like I spent 4 years of my life not really having a good time, but not really a bad time either. Like, I want to be known. I want to make a huge impression on everybody. Good or bad, I don't really care. I just....man, I don't know. But if I think I'm going to make a difference in the world I'm just kidding myself, because if I come out of hiiiiiiigh school where it's not even that hard to make an impact, like IMPACTLESS it's pretty inevitable my life is going to be a failure. So my cuuuz is a senior at the beeeeeerkeley..but I guess she has to go one more year, but like..she was talking about how she doesn't really feel like a kid anymore...or even young. And she was talking about like actually being a biological engineer..like I don't know why, but that's the most depressing thing I've actually felt for awhile. She wasn't sad though, she she's ready to move on. But on to WHAT? A job, marriage, kids. Please...keep me away from that fate. I don't want to be a mom. I wan't to work, but I want to do what IIIII am interested in, not some boring 9-5 yuppy job. Fuck thaaat. So I basically have 4 more years until the end of my life. Great. The same amount of time I did in high school. Lisa told me I was a drama queen yesterday. I don't think I am, I'm just realistic. People sugar-coat stuff to make it not seem so terrible. But I don't know, I'm pretty sad about this. Leave a comment if you have an opinion on this. Seriously..I want feedback. please?.. ha"

"event","yeah you heard me...

Hello, so anyways, here i am at... oh 2:55 in the morning..and i'm quite bored because no one is online to talk to. So i was sitting here thinking about how funny dave chappelle is and how i wanna try and meet him, but how? Thats the real question.. so anyways, i am very bored and so i started thinking about what our conversation would entail, and whatnot... adaptation is a very good movie. To me, it is what lost in translation is but more interesting..yes more interesting. Lost In Translation is good though.. but anyways, a while back i was telling somebody about how much i liked Jim Carrey's character in Eternal Sunshine, and wondering why i liked that type of guy, self deprecating, smart, kinda reserved, etc.. and they told me that i should just like charlie kauffman instead because he is every single male protagonist he writes into his screenplays.. then i started liking that guy because he used the word ""protagonist"". so in adaptation donald kauffman says to his brother,  ""You are what you love, not what loves you"", and something about nobody being able to take that away from you. Who agrees with that? I guess i do to an extent.. like, what you love makes you who you are i guess, like... what/who you love is like untouchable..like sacred... you control it, it makes you the person you are. but what also makes you the person you are is if what you love love's you back ... like, okay for anybody who has ever read slapstick by kurt vonnegut?.. like these two (deformed ) kids were isolated in this old mansion because their rich socialite parents couldn't deal with such ugly childeren. they grew up with no love and although they didnt really love their parents, it made them different people with kinda screwy emotions that have never really been loved growing up. so in conclusion..i somewhat disagree..it is what/who you love that makes you who you are to a degree, but depending if what/who recipricates the feelings, makes a bigger difference in the person you are, because everybody needs ta be feelin da love, ya heard?!?! But then is it really love if the other person doesn't love you back? yeah i dunno. i mean, infatuation with somebody is most certainly not love. and if one thinks they are in love but in reality are just infatuated with the person, just ""crushin"", then this whole argument becomes invalid, because love is only real when it's mutual? no, i dunno. im not sure i even agree with that... like i love my dog, but does he love me? maybe, maybe not. he's pretty dumb..so im guessin no. So i think, that if you think you love somebody and know that they don't love you back, then you gotta think real hard bout the existance of the love that you thought you felt. But hey, assholes, it's funny when Dave Chappelle says ""I'M RICK JAMES, BITCH"" , not when you do. guys.. my hommies... Everybody has heard this tired quote, from my grandma to charlie friggin kauffman to like... well everbody other than my grandma and charlie. it is no longer funny. it is no longer witty. you've ruined it.. you've smashed it into the ground, so much so that if i hear another person say this, i'll.. well i wouldn't do anything actually. but it's time for the phrase to be retired.. it was funny, it had a long, loooooooong run, and even dave chappelle thinks the phrase needs to no longer be repeated (i am just assuming this). I guess there's one exception to this, Dave Chappelle can still say it, because we all know how he's da man.. i guess this would be a good convo starter? ehh..well ill keep workin.. crap, why aren't i sleepy yeeeeeeeeeeet... :(:(:("

"event","i went to jennys party and saw the stepford wives today. both were fun, lol. i talked to lindsay brown for a longgg time. what a sweet girl! haha, anyways, the movie was really. good. okay so plot of the movie is that these husbands turn their powerful, corporate wives into sex fiends...housework maniacs...and personality void superficial women.. like ""the perfect wife"", june cleaver with breast implants. anyways so when the men were confessing why they turned their wifes into that, they said it was because ""we were tired of never being as good as our wives at anything, so we turned them into personalityless... undriven wives with only goal in life is pleasing us"". well im a analyzer...its one of my flaws. but anyways i got to thinking...this would never happen, im not just talking about the whole robotish part, lol. but like your attracted to people for a reason. no matter how different each of your significant others may be from each other...they all have qualities which you admire...or attracted to. somebody who marries a driven, powerful woman...definitely has a personality which needs to be the lesser person in the relationship. sadly, im one of those people. i like people to be smarter than me, less annoying then me, less talkative then me, and nicer than me. hahaha. people are attracted to people that have the qualities they wish they had. perfect example: eternal sunshine. jim carrey, a quiet, caring, smart, undaring guy is attracted to clementine who is fun, because he subconsiously he wishes he was that. and visa versa, she probably wished that she was that stable, or smart, or nice. anyways, nobody who would marry and fall in love with a successful woman would ever ever ever be satisfied with a brainless sex fiend housewife like they depicted in the movie. nope."

Ben Folds Five- Evaporated 1:08--->HERE I STAND...
my 15 mintute break from studying... 


*here I stand, SAD AND FREE, I can't cry and I can't see
    
*I've faith that there's a soul somewhere who's leading me around... i wonder if he knows which way is down...

*don't you know I'm numb, man. no I can't feel a thing at all, 'cause it's all smiles and business these days and I'm indifferent to the loss

*Blind man on a canyon's edge of a panoramic scene
  *or maybe I'm a kite that's flying high and random dangling a string
    *Or slumped over in a vacant room head on a stranger's knee
***I'm sure back home they think I've lost my mind***


PS. I love my past. I love my present. I'm not ashamed of what I've had, and I'm not sad because I have it no longer. <---i like this quote. okay i admit. im kind of a nostalgic person... and i hate change. but that quote makes sense, it makes me less sad. and i dont even like school. but all of a sudden today when i left spanish i got really sad. like im going to miss shakeibee??? nah, haha. im just going to miss the routiness of knowing exactly where im going to be all the time. i mean something you do for 9 straight months is pretty like infiltrated in you. you cant very easily stop cold turkey without some kind of emotion right? yeah. ...and i cant see."

"event","so, i saw this 5 minute clip of my obsession aka degrassi (nobody hypes premieres like noggin, nope, uh-huh), and ive come to the conclusion that spinner is either a) getting more attractive or b) everyone else is getting uglier.
 
ok, so i admit, spinner is actually attractive. Like, as a real person... he is good looking. But on the heirarchy that is Degrassi he ranks low and is boring.

Therefore, he should die.

But anyways, to demonstrate, or explain how significantly this show affects my life... i have begun to subconsciously place people i know into different catagories, or degrassi characters. okay, so if a girl's a bitch, she's ""paige"", a hot boy is ""craig"" if your gay, your ""marco"". and i am an ""ash"". ash can be a bitch, but is usually sweet. and then there's toby, who i am convinced is dan's long lost canadian twin brother. the resemblance is, let me tell you, it's scary. i could list the character traits, appearance traits that are the same, but i'll spare you. ask heather or joells, i gave them a 10 minute schpiel on their my theory. ha sorry. 

ps. i just ordered the donnie darko dvd, with the directors cut, score. oh and since we're on the topic of dvd's... i also bought requiem for a dream last week. that movie is intense... and i am in love with the way that movie was filmed. it's like, some of the shots like when sarah eats the grapefruit and egg, i think that scene is amazing. and also after marion sleeps with that guy, it shows her walking but like the camera is moving, but she isn't, well i don't really know how to explain it well enough to do the movie justice, and there are tons of scenes that are just as amazing, so i guess i'll just tell you to rent the movie, it's well worth it. and as for donnie darko, well that movie is effin brilliant, enough said."

soul-mate- One of two persons compatible with each other in disposition, point of view, or sensitivity. 

what is love?
how do you know if your in love?
what does it feel like?
[i deleted a paragraph right here. left me too vulnerable to the reader. nobody needs or wants to know about my mad max mushy bullshit]

i want somebody in my life to sing me this song... its gorgee.

Crazy skies all wild above me now
Winter howling at my face
And everything I held so dear
Disappeared without a trace
Oh all the times I've tasted love
Never knew quite what I had
Little Darling if you hear me now
Never needed you so bad
Spinning round inside my head

I've been talking drunken gibberish
Falling in and out of bars
Trying to find some explanation here
For the way some people are
How did it ever come so far

Sail away with me honey
I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be
I wanna hold you now

I put my heart in your hands
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Sail away with me
What will be will be

"event","Well let's see... today Brandon came over and made me watch tennis. We argued whether Serena Williams or some french chick with hairy underarms should win. Need I say victory came to me... well Serena Williams, who I picked. So yeah me and Quinn watched some tv and went outside and I jumped on the trampoline. She just watched and made fun of the way my feet move when I jump. I took my socks off and threw them at her but they fell under the deck. Well if that wasn't interesting. I didn't want to go down there and walk over the rocks and stuff so we leaned over the edge with a crow bar that was handily lying around and tried to fish them out... didn't work. We were laughing so hard we were almost falling off the deck. So then I got the barbecue tongs off of the grill and fished them out that way. And my dad asked me to carry these big concrete tubes things inside so I put it on my head like a pope hat and nearly took off my head and the door to the house. I haven't laughed as hard as I did today in a long time. Our stomachs hurt afterwards. It was great. Well my mom is supposed to be coming to get me sometime tonight and we have to go get shoes for work. I need all black leather shoes but um what my boss doesn't know is I'm not going to buy leather shoes... oh well I don't think he will care as long as they are all black. He told me what color socks to wear too. Ummm I have to wear pants what does it matter? Yeah so last night me and Quinn watched movies and went for a midnight soda run. I think I am going to buy my own black pants for work so they actually fit. So this weekend I am going to the parade, going to my aunts party, going to work and making it out just in time to watch the fireworks with Brandon and mi madre. I have to work 5-9 all weekend which means no Heritage fair. Welp I am going to go eat. My dad made pizza. Yummmmmmmmmmmm......."

"event","I had my interview at Taco Bell today. I got hired on the spot. I have an orientation on Wednesday. The problem is I am having quite the trouble getting my hands on my social security card. And I have to give up Kings Dominion, Ocean City, going to the cabin and probably Warped Tour to get a stupid job. Oh well I have to in order to drive and hopefully once I can drive things will work themselves out better. I can't ask for any days off until I have worked there 3 months. Ho Hum... But Brandon came over and we went to Subway and the video game store and to Record and Tape Traders where I blew the rest of my money on three Saves the Day cd's. I had to replace them because my stuff mysteriously gets messed up or just goes missing. I think it is a little bug called the little sister bug that does such things. My dad tried to teach me how to parrallel park... no such luck. I sucked at it. Last night me, Crystal and Quinn had a sleepover on the trampoline. Me and Crystal were scurd. I came inside at like 4.30 am because they were sleeping and I couldn't and I needed to get some shut eye. We ate crabs yesterday. Mmmmm.... Then Jimmy and Dan came over and had to show everyone up on the trampoline. Well that was a bit of craziness. And yeah, I think that's about it. <3"

"event","Ok so I guess a lot has happenned recently well not really but I've done some stuff. Last Saturday I went to Hershey Park with my family and Brandon came too. Me and Brandon just wound up going off and meeting up with them at the end of the day. Basically because my cousins were annoying me to death. One had an attitude was trying to be all tough cuz this girl kept ""mugging"" her. Grr... It was annoying. So yeah we got on pimped out go kart tracks and went to the zoo part and played in the arcade instead of waiting in 3 hour rollercoaster lines. We got on the Great Bear and SooperDooperLooper becuase there wasn't a big line. That was fun. And I ""took his virginity"", Kissing Tower virginity that is. He had never been on it so he wanted to go on it. Yeah I was supposed to be honored that I was allowed to take his Kissing Tower virginity. But it's cool. You can see the whole park from up there. So then on Father's Day I went over my grandparent's with my dad and there was this guy stalking us at Wal-Mart that morning. Me, my mom and my sister went to get Father's Day cards and he kept following us into places where it was empty and I got creeped out so I told my mom to ummmm... let's go look uhhhhh... somewhere else. She eventually got the picture. So the rest of the week was pretty boring. There is nothing to do and it's summer vacation. But I should be able to drive pretty soon. So that's pretty awesome. My dad said once I get a job that my parents could work something out to loan me the money for a car and some of car insurance and I could pay them back over time. So I did some more job searching and I signed up for driving school. I have an interview at Taco Bell tomorrow. I think I can get a job there, I hope I can. Everyone has been saying tat it's gross but I don't care. If it means me driving I'm perfectly happy with anything. The only problem is I probably won't be able to go down to the ocean when my mom goes. That sucks big time. So Friday I went to see Dodgeball with Crystal and Quinn again. I went to see it last week with Brandon. It's still funny the second time around. Then we went back to Crystal's house and made a midnight trip to McDonalds. We were on our way home when Tiff called and we had to pick her up from scary farmville. We were so scared. It was pitch black, woods all around and we were driving down some bumpy dirt road. I half expected some guy with a chainsaw to come running out of the woods. Yesterday I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11. It was really sad. Everyone in the whole theatre was crying. As far as the factual stuff they brought out in the movie it was interesting but other than that it was just as much propaganda and bullshit as the people they were criticizing. I wasn't really impressed. Then after we got out there was this police officer guy that stopped us and asked what we thought of the movie and was telling us about how it's not true that the men in Iraq want to be there. That's bs too I say. I don't care if he was there I know the guys over there would much rather not be freakin dying. Tell me that guy wasn't strategically placed. Yeah so it made me have nightmares. In my dream I was in a really tall office building downtown over looking the inner harbor. It was dark outside and all the sudden I saw five planes fly across the water. Then we watched one fly into another building and explode then one came at the builiding we were looking in. We all started running down the stairs and I made it out. I went to another building where kids were being taken to for safety. It was a really huge school with lots of flights of stairs and stuff. We started playing games and going into the library and stuff to keep our minds off what happened and another plane flew into the school. Everyone started running down aaaaaallllll these flights of stairs to get out but for some reason the stairs kept winding for me and going back up to where I came from and they were twisting and turning and only I couldn't get out. It was so scary because it seemed sooo real!! Ugh. It gives me the creeps just thinking about it. Then my mom woke me up to see if I wanted to go to my uncles ball game. But I didn't go because I had Jocaob's birthday party today. My sister left with my aunt for OC for a week. WOO HOO!!! Welp that's about it so ummm... yeah. Bye! <3"

"event","Ok. So let's see since Wednesday what has happenned? Thursday I went to the mall with my mom to put in job applications and I got a really cute new bathing suit. It's pink and stripey and has a skirt to it. I hope I get a job at one of those places. Friday me, Q and Crystal went to the movies and saw Saved. It was good, very funny. On Saturday I went to my Aunt Terri's birthday party. My dad was going to have his family over our house for my birthday on Saturday. My mom made him cancel because she said I HAD to be at my aunt's party. She even said she had a surprise planned for me so it would be ruined if I wasn't there. If I wouldn't have been there nobody would've have even noticed. She just said the surprise thing so my dad didn't say no I couldn't go. It was gis day anyway so he would've. Everytime I go over her house my allergies kill me. She has 2 cats. I was 100 kinds of miserable all day. I was going to go to PhilPhest afterwards but I felt like crap. I went home early with Dwayne and he stopped and got me Taco Bell and I went home and went to sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and turned over to face my tv because I had left it on. As soon as I opened my eyes I saw a close up of Hannibal and almost screamed. haha. And Friday night someone called my cell phone with this half retarded half gangster voice and just said hello like 50 times. I thought it was Brandon acting stupid because well Brandon likes to act stupid and put on retarded voices on the phone. So I said shut up nerd and the person just kept saying hello so I hung up. I thought Brandon would have called right back so when I talked to him the next day he said it wasn't him. Uh oh! Well the same person called again Saturday and asked for Tyrell. I said he had the wrong number so he asked who he was talking to. Then he was like Oh you're name's Erika? Well how you doooin' Erika? He freaking woke me up, had the wrong number and then was going to try to hit on me? HUH?!?! I just said bye and hung up. He freaking called back like 5 times. It was like midnight the last time he called. Grrrrrrrr..... Well my mom gave me my birthday presents. She got me gift cards to Divah and Forever 21 and a really pretty pink crystal-y dragonfly necklace and a black and silver shoe charm bracelet and a bracelet that's green with little ladybugs. It was all really pretty. And my aunt gave me a necklace that said sweet 16. Oh yeah I bought a new shirt too. It says what is it tuna or chicken. I love it! Today I went to Kayla's christening and then over Connie and Jerry's house. Mmmmm... lots of good food. It was fun. 
EW EW EW!!! My image of Jake Gyllenhal has been shattered! They just said on tv that him and Kirstin Dunst were caught having sex in a dressing room. That and Anna Nicole Smith had sex with a ghost... but that's expected. Ew!
Today my mom freaked out on me and Heather for no reason as usual... She does that at least twice a week. We should've expected it.
Creed broke up. Oh my. I am oh so heartbroken. No more Creed. No more crappy music from them. 
Hmmm... I'm bored I'm gonna go."

"event","Ok so Sunday me and Brandon did make it to the drive-in. We saw Shrek 2. He picked me up from my mom's house which made it much less hectic. His mommy got rid of Kyle's duck. :'( But she took it to a duck lady so that's good. He got way too big to keep in the house. So we saw Shrek 2 which was funny. And then we had to leave because it was already late and I had a speech to make the next morning and he was leaving for OC. I wish I would have gotten to see The Day After Tomorrow. Jake Gyllenhal............ <3. So then Brandon brought me home and was off to OC for senior week. Monday I made my speech. I was so nervous but I was told that I kept my composure well and everyone told me my nervousness was cute... Yeah I really don't see that. Oh yes... sweaty palms and a face white as a ghost is adorable. But I got to wear the adorable black and white polka dot dress I just bought. I love it. Tuesday was my birthday and the elections. I won. Yay! Three years down and won... one election to go. But the day wasn't so great besides that. Everyone kind of forgot about my birthday. I felt really sick in third period and I went into lunch sat down and realised that if I did do something about my dizziness quick I was going to pass out. That's the scariest feeling ever. Damn anemia!!!! God I wish I didn't have it!!!!!!!! Dr. Bowes came up to me and asked me if I was alright and I said no can I go to the nurse so she told the teacher that was standing next to her to walk me to the office because it has air condition and the nurse wasn't in. So they sat me in the back of the office and told me to sit really still and Miss Forrero (girls sports coach) came in. She asked if I had eaten and since I said no she had the secretary call down to the office for a bagel and apple juice. Someone brought it up to me so I ate that. She was checking my heart rate and putting cold wet napkins on me until my temperature and heart rate went down. Then Officer Ray questioned me about being anorexic. Haha there is noooooooo way I am anorexic. I eat way too much for that. So I went to fourth period. I couldn't go home because of elections. I was feeling a lot better but definately not 100% so I was so glad my class was in the nice cold auditorium and we weren't doing anything. God all of this was so embarrassing. So I walked home and it was so hot. I was locked out of my grandfather's house when I got there. He had forgotten to leave the basement door unlocked. Oh my gosh I thought I was about to die. So he got home a little while later and let me in so I just stayed in the basement and watched the DVD Katie gave me. She made me truffles too. She's so sweet. She got me Zeigland Girls because it has Judy Garland in it. It's such a good movie. God I wish we stil had a pool. It's so hot. So anyway when I went to go to the freezer I actually passed out. When I got a grip on myself which was only like a second later the whole left side of my face was numb and tingly. I was so scared. My mom finally got there and I told her. I don't normally tell her this stuff because she panics waaaaay too much. But I told her this because I was so scared. Well she didn't even care enough to listen to me for two seconds. She just ignored me and would say yeah ok right uh huh.... if that. Well we went down to get my sister and ate at the Dock of the Bay. That was nice. Aunt Terri and Nikki and Madison came too. Aunt Lori wouldn't come because she didn't feel like driving 20 whole minutes down there. That kind of hurt because I remember how my whole family held this huge nice dinner at this fancy restaurant for Nicole's 16th birthday. Everyone in my family bought her all this jewelry and it was this whole big tadoo, you know? And my Aunt Terri and Nikki were the only ones out of my family who would come eat crabs with us. I didn't want them to get me presents and all that stupid stuff but geesh just come have a free dinner. But all my mom would talk about was how she had so much to do for my Aunt Teri's birthday party this weekend. I had trouble just getting her to listen to anything I said all night. She just really didn't care about anything. And then when we got home and she right away started yelling about the dogs being in the basement when I keep telling her to leave the gate thing up and she doesn't. It's her fault they were down there! I went in my bedroom as soon as we got home and no one talked to me for the rest of the night. I mean most kids would have freaked out that their parents didn't get them a birthday present or that they didn't buy them a car for mtheir 16th birthday. But I just wanted for one night for my mom to make me feel a little special for at least listening to how my day was or maybe singing me happy birthday or something. Hey, maybe that makes me a spoiled rotten horrible kid like she thinks I am. She freaked out on me about the driving sunbject which I will rant about later because it's long and I'm tired of typing. Today was boring... we got out two hours early because of the heat."

"event","Well let's see where to start. Well today is mine and Brandon's one year anniversary. We are supposed to go to the drive-in because yeah that's where he asked me out. I hope it doesn't rain. Friday was a very confusing day, for a lot of reasons. A lot of reasons pertaining to one subject. It's funny how a person that says they love you so much can hurt you so much. Further proof that I have some great grade A friends. At least I know I can always trust them. Friday night I went to Brandon's graduation. I stopped on the way and got him balloons and a card so getting there was a trip. My card was so cheesy... I tried to write nice stuff and it always just winds up super corny. Me and my dad didn't know where we were going. We were running way late. The truck was full of balloons that were always in the way. It was raining and I was trying to write out a card. Phew that's some Ringling Brothers shit right there. Then I got there and I couldn't find him or his family to find a seat. So I wound up standing in the back with a bunch of balloons that kept bopping people. Luckily I found Cat and some other people. I would have been totally miserable standing the whole time by myself. So we pulled chairs to the side of the gym and watched from there. There were about twice as many people there as there were chairs so we lucked out. I saw Justin... I didn't even recognize him until he waved. I miss that kid. So yeah graduation itself was about as fun as a bullet to the head. lol. But I was glad to be there. I'm happy for everyone and congrats to everyone!!! Then after some mingling and meeting of family we went back to Brandon's house. A bunch of people were there. Then a little bit later he brought me home and I was so tired I just crashed. Then yesterday I woke up and realised Gabi was here. That was cool. Then Blythe and Courtney came over and me, Quinn and Gabi went to the thrift store. There was this old man there that kept talking to me. He was asking me what this little remote thing was and I told him it was too a remote control car. So then I had to explain to him what a remote control car is and he didn't understand that it wasn't a REAL car. Then he started rambling to me about how he used to play with bugs and radios and the CIA and FBI. He never felt the need to call them by their abbreviations. Strange character. I got a pair of pants that I really like and a skirt. Then we came back to the house and watched the horse race and ate some good food. I was sad that Smarty didn't win. Then I rode with my dad to take Heather to my mom's so I could stock up on clothes. I am staying here tonight and tomorrow so I can get to school ridiculously early on Monday and Tuesday. EEK! Speeches and elections! Wish me luck!!! Well anyway then I went over Crystal's and we got lots of food and spent the night and all that good stuff. My phone rang at 2.30 am and it scared the begeebies out of me. It was loser face Brandon. So this morning me and Q came home and now they are all out on the boat but I had to stay in to wait for my mom to come get me. I have to go back out to my mom's house print stickers for tomorrow and go the store and manage to get back here in time to go to the drive-in. This is hectic. Well I'm done writing so yeah bye."

"event","I can't wait until I can drive and I have a car. This morning my Dad took my sister back to my mom's house and didn't bother telling me or asking me if I wanted to go. Me and my mom were supposed to go get me job applications from a bunch of different places today. Well now he definately isn't going to take me all the way up there and there is no way my mom is going to come get me. He said he thought it would be good for me too spend the weekend here. What? Excuse me. Um nooooo? When I'm here he just stays up in his room with Cathy and Quinn isn't here so he thought it would be best for me to just sit in my room by myself for the weekend? That's what I always wind up doing. Ugh.

Well anyway last night was Natalie's party. It was so much fun!! We all had such a good time... besides the small bit of drama. Boys are definately the stupidest things on Earth... all of them! There were a couple I thought were exceptions but no there are no exceptions. Except for one... a certain Jimmy but he might as well just be a girl anyway. She made each of us little sashes with funny superlative things on them. Cat was most blonde... lol most definately. She gave me most unique... I don't know if I should take that as a compliment or not. And we all got beads and crowns. And the boys got firefighter hats instead of crowns. But they wound up wearing crowns anyway. So me and Cat and Kerry took their firefighter hats and put the crowns around them. lol. It was hott. I am going to make Cat send me the goofy pictures we took. So yeah for the first couple hours we just hung out at her house and ate and listened to music and danced around. And Jeff was randomly flashing everyone... with his camera. And then he hooked his camera up to the tv and the pictures flashed up on the big screen. How embarassing! lol Seriously he just would not give it up. lol. Then we loaded up in everyone's cars and went to rock 'n' bowl. I won the first game!!! Woo hoo! I am a HORRIBLE bowler too! Ask anyone that knows me. lol. I'm the worst. And people kept staring at us because we were all singing really loud and dancing and yeah. That was a lot of people too. Yeah it was a lot of fun. 

And and and I got a part in The Women! I auditioned Wednesday and Thursday I found out I got a role. It's a comedy they are putting on in the fall. I got the role of Peggy. I'm nervous about it though. I don't know if I can stay focused with people laughing. lol. I might laugh too. Oh well. My first rehearsal is Tuesday. They are just giving out scripts though. I don't know if I can make it because of the Farewell Assembly but then again I don't know if Brandon wants me to go to that or not. My teacher said that is a perfectly vaild reason for not being there though. But I swear she said afternoon rehearsals and now they are evening so I better e able to drive myself by then. Hopefully I can juggle a job and a play. Daminique is getting me an application from where she works. She said I can make it so I only work on weekends so that's good. And she said if I stick with working there and get 1000 hours they will give me $4000 for college. That's a plus. But I am going to try to get a job someplace in White Marsh. It's close to my mom's house and there's lots of places.

My birthday is in 11 days! Woo Hoo! I think for my birthday my dad is going to pay for driving school. So maybe then my mom wil help me buy a car. She said sh would buy me a car but I don't see that happenning. Not that I blame her. But I think her and my stepdad would help me buy one. Last night I saw Alayna's new car. It is really nice. June 8th can't come soon enough and then July 9th is right around the corner. :) 

My dad wants me to go out on the boat with him and Cathy. But my allergies are killing me and I don't have any warm clothes here. Plus they are going to be fishing which means sitting there waiting for a rod to bend. And fishing is just not my idea of something I want to do. Going out for a boat ride would be different. Plus Cathy always gets all pissed off when I go out on the boat. Doesn't make for a pleasant experience. My dad said to invite Brandon along but I doubt he's even up yet and I don't know if he'd even want to go. 

Yeah well I think I'm out of things to write about. Later Gators."

"event","First..get a pen and paper. When you actually 
choose names, make sure it's people you actually 
know and go with your first instinct.

Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read 
ahead or you'll ruin it!

1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a 
column.














2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any 
two numbers you want.












3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of 
members of the opposite sex.












NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON""T TURN OUT RIGHT! 




4. Write anyone's name (like friends or 
family....) in the 4th, 5th, and 6th spots.












5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and 11.












GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!! 




6. Finally, make a wish. 













And now the key for the game..... 






1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people 
about this game. 













2. The person in space 3 is the one that you 
love.












3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't 
work out.












4. You care most about the person you put in 4. 













5. The person you name in number 5 is the one 
who knows you very well. 













6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star. 













7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with 
the person in number 3. 












8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7














9. The tenth space is the song that tells you 
most about YOUR mind. 













10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel 
about life 




NOW... post this in an entry, or whatever.. within an hour.
and your wish will come true...
If you don't it will become the opposite."

I'm sick of clapping when I know I can do it better for myself. I'm sick of waiting. Sick of all these words that will never matter... </P>
<P>I'm so sick of everything right now. I'm sick of school, everything about it. I'm sick of classwork and homework and not knowing what the hell is going on. I'm sick of everyday cramming all this useless information into my head until my brain feels like it's about to explode. I leave school with a horrible headache over all this crap that I'll never use. I only have to learn it to pass a bunch of retarded tests. When in my life will I need chemistry? </P>
<P>I'm sick of being lied to. </P>
<P>I'm sick of excuses. </P>
<P>I'm sick of feeling like absolutely nothing. </P>
<P>I'm sick of every muscle in my body being so tense that it hurts. </P>
<P>I'm sick of stressing myself out all the time and nothing ever seems to work out. </P>
<P>I'm sick of being made a fool of.</P>

<P>I'm sick of caring so much. </P>
<P><STRONG>I'm sick of pretending that things don't bother me, that things don't hurt.</STRONG> </P>
<P>HFStival and prom were this weekend. Ha. I had NO IDEA someone I used to know is in Underscore. That's so cool. Weird but cool. I'm happy for him. I saw Tom there. I was supposed to meet Sophie and Taneesha too but it didn't happen. You couldnt get any service in there so I couldn't call any of them. Taking Back Sunday and Lit were the best I saw. Lit was awesome and Adam from Taking Back Sunday hung from the light grid and sang it was great. I saw: Underscore, Yellowcard,&nbsp; Lost Prophets, Lit, Taking Back Sunday, and Papa Roach. I left at 3:30 to go Brandon's prom. I missed NFG, Offspring, Modest Mouse, The Violent Femmes and THE CURE. God I wish I could have seen The Cure. I thought that was kind of a big deal, that I missed one of the greatest bands of all times to go to Brandon's prom. All my friends told me I was crazy, even people who I don't even know said that was crazy. But it was something that was a big deal for someone that means more to me than that so it was more important to go to prom. Brandon is more important to me than that. Noone else could see that I guess. I thought it might actually mean something to him that I did that but no it just blew up in my face. I would rather be at&nbsp;a great concert than go to a dance but it wasn't a chore. And supposedly that's what I acted like. I hate feeling like everything is always my fault. If someone did that for me I would feel so special. It would mean the world to me. I can't see anyone ever doing something like that for me though. It's been made very clear to me that I don't rate real high on the importance scale. Especially when compared to other things. Well I came home from the festival and got ready in less than an hour. Then my mom and dad and my aunt and Brandon's mom took about a jillion pictures at Brandon's house. But when I got there and saw how beautiful everyone else looked I felt like I looked even crappier than I already had. I mean you have to look pretty bad for the person you are with to tell every girl in there how pretty they look except for you. Right? I mean if your own boyfriend doesn't think you look nice than I guess you must look pretty bad. But hey everyone else told me I looked nice so yeah. I don't know maybe they were just being nice. I can't dance but&nbsp;I did anyway. I didn't particularly want to but I did anyway. I got three offers to be someone else's date because mine kept leaving me, and with people that&nbsp;don't like me for whatever reason. Roe and Steve and Jen&nbsp;invited me to their parties afterwards but I was immediately uninvited, not by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday was my dad's birthday. I feel bad because nobody did anything for him. I feel REALLY bad. But he got to spend the day stress free out on his new boat and I think that's what he would rather have. My daddy's 40. He's getting up there. lol. UGH!&nbsp;I still have homework to do. I think I'm just going to go to sleep after that and see if&nbsp;I feel better in the morning... hopefully. Plus my power will probably go out soon.</P>"

"event","<P>Ok so recently yeah not too much has happened. Last night I had to work at junior prom. Everyone looked so pretty!! Man, you'd think they would take it easy on three girls who volunteered their Saturday nights to do them a huuugee favor but nooo waaay!! They put us to WORK!! I mean yeah I knew I would had to serve drinks and stuff by gzpz!! We were going and going and going and it seemed like the line for slurpees and drinks and food never stopped! It was hechtic. I had to set up because Amanda and Katie weren't there yet and the guy had me hauling this huge cooler back and forth to the ice machine and the handle broke off. Grrr... So&nbsp;I had to push it back and forth. That wouldn't have been SO bad but Miss Notaro told me to look nice and dress dressy so I had a skirt on. It was sooo hot back in our little blocked off corner. I swear it had to be 100 degrees!! They put lunch tables all around us so we couldn't see the outside world. And then after that we had to clean up everything and pack everything up and take down all the decorations. And Officer Ray went around to pop all the ballons but they had three star balloons and she said they were too pretty to pop so the other officer went around and untied them all and was going to give one to each of us since us three you know worked all night. But Miss Notaro snapped at him and was like 'No I don't think so! <EM>I</EM> want those balloons!' Yeah we just thought that was kind of um nasty especially the way she said it. The cop started mocking her after she walked away. It was priceless!! What would she have done if when she asked if anyone could help out we said no?!?! They would have been stuck. But we each did get to slip out a few times and go boogie. lol. But only for a minute and then we had to go back into our corner. So I got to white girl bop with the lovely Natalie! lol It was great!! I've never seen any other school do the Thriller dance like they do the electric slide. IT WAS CRAZY!! Haha. It was great!!! But Nat looked soooooooooooo pretty!!! Absolutely gorgeous!!! Well yeah so yesterday before that me and my mom ran around a lot and got my shoes for prom they are really pretty!! I feel like a movie star in them!! <IMG height=279 src=""http://a1216.g.akamai.net/f/1216/955/6h/images2.nordstrom.com/images/store/product/large/118901.jpg"" width=290></P>

"event","Me and Quinn went for a walk and took some pictures and got a soda and went to the playgrous. It was fun but we had to come home because my bladder was about to die. I hope some pictures turn out good. 
My parents are going to kill me.... I'm not explaining but this is just reassurance that I am so not a rebel. lol. If you want to know yeah you can ask... Grrrr....
I might be getting a job soon. I hope I can get one at Casa Mia's. It would be cool to work with one of my friends and Nik says it's a pretty cool place besides one lame girl but you get that everywhere so yeah. 
My dad had a ""talk"" with me on the way home from school today. That's why he wouldn't let me drive I bet. He talked about how staying with Brandon is just going to hurt me and he is going to meet someone else when he goes to college and they say everything is inevitable so why do we stay together. He said us being together for a year is too long. I know they are just looking out for me but why can't my parents just let me be happy? I mean I'm not saying those things aren't going to happen... I don't know what is going to happen. I'm not psychic. I'm going to do what makes me happy not think of all the risk involved. What is going to happen is going to happen. I don't look into the future because it never fails to scare me to death!! I just want to do what makes me happy and try to live for now. And if something bad happens, bad things will happen no matter how I am protected, I'll learn from it. It's part of growing up but my parents don't want to see that. They think telling me the ""facts"" is going to make me grow up and learn but I actually have to experiene things on my own. And my dad thinks it will open up so much for me and I said that the only thing I would be able to do without a boyfriend that I can't do now is go out wit hother guys and that's not what I'm wanting to do anyway... it's just not a good trade. lol And he talked about me driving and getting a car and a job and stuff.... I'm excited I can't wait until I can drive. 
UGH! I feel like crap!!! I feel like my whole body is full of snot and all of me hurts. :(
I'm going to bed... I'll just do my chem. homework tomorrow... if I feel ok to go to school. 
I'm going to bed. Good night!"

"event","I'm really bored. I should be doing homework but I only have chemistry anyway. Well yeah I haven't written in this thing in a while. Friday me and Quinn went to the carnival and met Crystal there. We got on the Gravitron and got some food but then it started pouring. It was lightning and everything and they still ran rides. Craziness. So we walked over to Taco Bell and I swear a guy put a soft taco shell down his pants before he made the taco. EEEEEWWWWW!!! We watched him like a hawk while our food was being made. And then we spent the night at Crystal's house. Saturday was the car wash. It was freezing in the morning but it got really warm. It was fun. We made $430. WOO HOO!! My back got so sunburnt that's been painful. And I'm getting real sick. :( I can't stop coughing or sniffling and sneezing. My throat hurts, my head hurts and my ears hurt. :( I've been sssoooooo miserable!! :(  I got my yearbook. It's pretty cool. Yeah ummmm bye!"

"event","Me and Quinn are about to go to the carnival. Should be fun. Crystal is meeting us there and I think maybe Brad too. And Jesse. Yes should be fun. I'm going to make Quinn get on rides. I'm so happy it's nice and warm and not raining. Hopefully it stays that way. Right now I am waiting for everyone to get a move on and talking to Heather and yeah... 
I think I should take a jacket just in case it gets chilly. I'm going to have to borrow one from Quinn.
I wish more people were going. Like Tiffanie and Shauna. I really wish they were going. And Brandon too. But he is going to see the Starting Line and The Ataris so that's cool. I was sort of like maybe a little bit invited but I got the dinstict feeling I wasn't really wanted there. Oh well. I'm going to the carnival anyway woo hoo!! Man boys really confuse me well not moys in general just one really... no make that boys in general for the most part confuse me. 
Yearbooks came out today but I didn't preorder one so I have to buy it on Tuesday. They are pretty cool. All the pictures of me in there look goofy. Everyone keeps telling me the class president picture looks emo. whatever. They told me what to do. I had to look away from the camera because they were doing a Brady Bunch thing so I had too be looking at the logo. Oh yeah and I got told that me having paint stins on my jacket was being 'emo'. Noooo it's me having all my clothes packed up still and Quinn attacking me with paint. HAHA. That paint battle was fun. Well yeah I'm going to go see when we are going to get out of herre. Later Gator!"

"event","Well things have gotten better today I guess. I stopped thinking about everything so much so now I'm in a better mood. If things go wrong screw it there's nothing I can do about it. What is going to happen is going to happen whether I drive myself crazy about it or not. Today I went to the dentist and got my screwball tooth all fixed up. So that's good. My dentist is a rather large man with a very large belly. But larger than his belly is his belly button. He has a major outie and so it sticks out because his polo shirts that he wears are pretty tight on him. I swear no kidding it's as big as my fist! I try not to look at it when I talk to him but it's unavoidable! I find my eyes locked right on it. haha. But considering that when I'm in the chair I'm right at that level it's understandable. But I had a 10:00 appointment and didn't get in until 11:00. I hate waiting like that. :-/ So on the way back to school I stopped and got McDonalds so the guy on lunch duty thought I had skipped and went to McDonalds so I had to explain to him and even show him my late note. I did'n tdo anything in school all day. Dr. Umerley had a day for make up work in Chemistry and I didn't have any to do and then in Tech. Theatre he needed the kids who know what they are doing to work on stuff so I couldn't do anything there either. Oh well. So after school I walked to my grandfather's house. I hate walking by myself so much! I like walking but not alone. So then my dad picked me up from there and well now I'm here. Oh yeah today was the first time I'e ever driven on 695. I had to to go to the dentist. It was easy I thought it would be scary like everyone says but it was fine. I hope I can buy one of the extra yearbooks tomorrow. They seem really cool from what I saw of Brandon's but then again I only saw like two pages. Just the pictures of him he wanted to show off. Last night was fun though. Me and Q*Dawg just hung out here and I don't know it was funny. HAHA today Jimmy was hanging a curatin in Tech. Theatre and he was talking about the curtain and he yelled to us all from the ladder ""Mine is well hung!"" So yeah that was pretty funny. He didn't even notice until we were like think about what you just said. hahaha. Me and Sophie didn't do anything but talk to Jon Paul. He kept putting his hair in a rubber band and looking all gay like all the soccer players... it was great. Nikki actually didn't skip the class and came in a actually did something!! We were looking around for snow or flying pigs. IT WAS CRAZY!!! Yeah well I better get ready for mi madre to get here. &lt;3 Later Gator!"

"event","Lately everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong!! The move to Perry Hall was hell!! I was so stressed out and frustrated and sad... it was just bad!! I don't want to be so far away from my dad's house and school and Brandon. Everything is so boring up there. Everyone in my neighborhood is like 2 years old. School has sucked!! I had to leave my house at 10 of seven Monday and Tuesday to get to school for a meeting and Monday no one showed up so we couldn't hold it and Tuesday they were holding a breakfast for teachers in the library so we had nowhere to have it. My house is still in a million pieces so I can't find anything. I can't even start to get my room organized. Let's see... this is six houses in seven years. I was so sore on Monday from moving so much. We didn't have many people to help us this time. We were going from six am to midnight pretty much nonstop. Then my mom freaking got pulled over for a random tag check (that's legal?!?) and she had an insurance problem so she had to go to the courthouse and get it straightened out before she could drive again. That put a big slow on the moving process. But the only reason I went to school on Monday was because we had a mandatory officers meeting. Then noone showed up anyway and I don't live right down the street anymore so I couldn't just go home. Then in tech. theatre I leaned against a wall that I didn't know was painted so I got black paint all over my khaki pants and then more spilled on my shoes. Then I went to paint with Sophie and my roller just started to fall apart after I had spent 15 minutes cleaning it and getting on the freaking metal part. It just started unraveling. Then there were no more brushes/rollers so I had nothing to do but I got in trouble for not doing anything. Then the next day I got paint spilled on my pants again. On the way back from cleaning my pants I stepped in a paint tray full of paint someone left on the floor. Then for no apparent reason the corner of my lip started bleeding and it wouldn't stop so I had to hold a napkin to my lip for like two hours. GAH!!! Mr. Sichina likes to yell at me FOR NO REASON!! There are kids who don't do crap in his class and talk back and act all snotty... I'm not one of those kids and he yells at me for nothing. On Tuesday Brandon called and said he was going to come over my new house for a little while. I was soooooo happy. It was great after things had been so shitty. I was so afraid he wouldn't be able to come over like he used to so this just made me feel so much better. Well it didn't turn out as great as I thought... BOYS ARE SO CONFUSING!! So since then I've felt even more like crap!! :-X Yeah not feeling to good about anything right now. kjgyftrtyftyftydyttydtyd I don't feel like writing anymore."

Your birthday on the 29th adds a tone of idealism to your nature. 

You are imaginative and creative, but rather uncomfortable in the business world. 

You are very aware and sensitive, with outstanding intuitive skills and analytical abilities. 



The 29 reduces to 11, one of the master numbers which often produces much nervous tension. 

This is the birthday of the dreamer rather than the doer. 

You do, however, work very well with people.</td>

Like a shining star, you have no trouble being the center of attention
In fact, you often feel a bit hurt when all eyes aren't on you
You need to be number one in everything, no matter how trivial
And it's this ego that both hurts your confidence and helps you acheive

You're dramatic and a powerhouse of pure energy
You posess a divine quality or uniqueness that's hard to define
A natural performer, it's likely you'll become famous in some circles.
Just learn not to take everyone's reaction to you so personally!

Coochy choochy coo, what a cute little ANARCHIST we have here. You see everything as a means to an end, and that end is You. You don't understand why some saps do community service cause you wouldn't be caught dead picking up trash unless you were in an orange jumpsuit. You're also pretty angry at the world but are too self-concerned to do anything about it because you are an anarchist.

I am the way into the doleful city,

I am the way into a forsaken race.

Justice it was that moved my great creator;
Divine omnipotence created me,

"event","im sure most of you know were on the brink of destruction. we all kno but were so ignorant that we refuse to do anything about it. Except me. getting mail to our president if awfully hard now a days so how will i get 2 talk to, well i have the hook up. my cousin work in the white house at bushes side. if hes smart he would listen to a 16 year old genius(although you dont beleive me). most people have feared this day since the begging of time but have never done anything to avaid it, because they fear wat would happen to change destiny. luckly i dont beleive anyone controles what goes on in my life except me and one other. ill tell him not to get new people on the united nations because that is the beggining of it all. after that a new ruler of the middle east will arise and turn out to be the anti-christ completely preventable. instead of putting the first guy that comes up with an answer to their terrist problems, they elect someone else. like us, they may not like us but to prevent udder and complete destruction of man-kind they should under stand. as for the four army comming together get the leaders together and find common ground and agrre not to fight. people think god controles our lives and he does for most of the population and that is only because they are to afraid to question a being that you cant see. 


my other great idea is the cure for AIDS yes AIDS. most people dont know this but there is a very small percent of the population that is immune to this deadly virus. how did they get this way easy their ancesters were infected with the plague and lived. by their ancesters doing this made them immune. their missing a very crucial pieve to the hiv infection. its a chromosome but i dont remember which number it is. all we do is give the plague to ppl cure them and repeat as many times as need till the chromosome dissapears. cure found.


this isent an idea but a plan. as you kno i wanted to catch mono and i did like i said i would. i have two new plans. one is to fight my soul and yes it is possible ask me and ill tell you. my new plan is to learn how to use telikentetic powers. i think if one has the determination and patience this can be done. i will reserch into the trade practice it and hopefully conqure it. i will be god."

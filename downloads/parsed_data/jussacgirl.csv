Tremendously simple and fun. We all synch up, press play at the same time, then comment in the community like crazy. You needn't be a community member... or even have an LJ.

In case the writing above is too small to read properly- the community is www.shwatchalongs.livejournal.com, and the times are 12pm LA / 3pm New York / 8pm London on Sunday, June 24th.

Serious thoughts welcome along with smut and/or hilarious gifs.

It's my first time hosting, so I'm trying to drum up interest so I don't look like a loser when nobody shows up ;)

Anyone interested/willing to scout for interest?"

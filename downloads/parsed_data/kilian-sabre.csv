"event","Some online comics from when the show was running courtesy of the BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/ecomics/

Also for those who don't know Season 8 of Buffy and Season 6 of Angel are available as comics in stores.  Continuing on from where the tv series left off.

Finally, Ripper (a old school ghost story like show based on the character Giles from Buffy) is apparently back in talks. Joss mentioned that it has been green lighted at the SD Comic Con last year.  It's tentatively scheduled for a 2009 release though it isn't certain if it would be a series, tv movie, or straight to dvd movie. 

Keep your fingers crossed."

So it's not the return of the show itself I don't think, but still when that many people involved get together things tend to happen...

Edit:  I believe this is a movie, but maybe it will develop into a show.  From Joss' mouth:

Goners: 

""A fantasy thriller about a modern day girl who goes on a really strange ride,"" said Joss Whedon. ""It's about a girl named Mia, people know that, who sort of sees in a mystical way the underbelly of the city and of human society, and goes through a kind of extraordinary hell, and we all have a lot of fun in the process. ...This is much more a story about -- literally about human connection and whether or not it's possible. ... But it's told on a very mystical scale and, in a way like everything I've tried to do including Buffy, it's an antidote to that very kind of film, the horror movie with the expendable human beings in it. Because I don't believe any human beings are.""

And on a final note James Marsters in playing Picollo in the upcoming Dragon Ball Z movie. I caught him on Smallville the other night - he sounded so much not like Spike that it threw me for a loop.  Unfortunately I haven't really caught anything of his presence on Smallville but I don't watch the show so ~shrug~."

"event","The Center is so proud of our community, of our allies and of a City Council courageous and committed enough to cast the votes and make a stand for fairness and equality and against hate and discrimination. We are particularly proud of our own Councilmember Toni Atkins, who bravely and tenaciously led this momentous effort. 
Yesterday, our community again made history, as the San Diego City Council supported marriage equality by voting to sign on to the amicus briefs in the marriage equality case currently before the California Supreme Court. 

The Councilmembers who voted ""yes,"" on the same measure on Sept. 4 (Scott Peters, Toni Atkins, Jim Madaffer and Ben Hueso), were joined by Councilmember Donna Frye, resulting in a 5-3 victory. This means that San Diego could join other California cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and Long Beach in supporting this case by signing a friend-of-the-court (amicus) brief. 

The future of this item is now in the hands of San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders. We know the Mayor has heard from our community, and we believe him to be a courageous leader who will do the right thing and make this decision with fairness and integrity. Please e-mail Mayor Sanders and thank him for his past support of civil rights issues and encourage him to stand with us again on this important issue of equality. The Mayor's e-mail address is jerrysanders@sandiego.gov.

The Center and its Public Policy Department would like to express our sincere and deep appreciation to all those who called and wrote to the members of the City Council over the past two weeks, and particularly to all those who attended the hearing at City Hall and courageously testified before the Council. Your presence, your testimony and your support made a difference. You helped make this moment in our history possible. Thank you. As always, The Center will keep you posted as to new developments."

i had made plans to get together with a friend down there, but i am waiting for her call still.  i really just want to get out of here and get to doing whatever i'm doing.  i hate waiting around for people, or i hate that i have no life and have to wait around for people.  probably the latter i guess. arg."

i'm still missing work, and there's a lot of stuff i have to do that i'm not looking forward to.  i still have a lot of anxiety when dealing with stuff that i don't want to. 

but things are getting bet and i'm at a point in my life where i can truly do anything i want and excuses would just not be viable.  i'm ready i think though.  i want to have the life i always wanted.

This is just a great melodic song with Sara's vocals reminiscent of another Sarah...  ""down by the river side, i lay my burdens down, now i'm traveling light.  my spirit lifted high, i found my freedom now and i'm traveling light""

<a href=""http://s13.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=0GGQOATEP266S2DFZR3P1KYE7Z"">The Coffee Song by Jars of Clay</a> - a fun departure from their usual.

""but when we would land i might take pity on you, i can crack all your ribs, but i can't break your heart.  you will never love me.  and this i can't forget.  that you will never love me as long as i will live.""

<a href=""http://s13.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=31012PRBQC2SH0C41Q7XYZXNLG"">Fall Into Me - Mudvayne</a> -for something a little heavier.  this got some radio play, but the lyrics are really interesting and the song reminds me a bit of A Perfect Circle.  ""dreams of earthquakes, dreams of hurricanes, dreams of pouring rain, dreams of tidal waves (to wash us all away), dreams of guns blaze, dreams of fire rage, dreams of swollen graves, dreams of swollen pain, all gone. no more fallen, no more enemies, no more casualties, no more dreams""

<a href=""http://s13.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=095MGZECBCIO83CRU80WNLIQSB"">When I'm Gone - Eminem</a> -probably my favorite of his more serious stuff.  really quite a powerful song if you listen. ""have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for.  not the expression, no, literally give an arm for.  when they know they're your heart and you know you are their amour and you would destroy anyone who would try to harm her.""

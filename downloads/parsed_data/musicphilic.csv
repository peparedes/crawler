The Buzzcocks- Why Can't I Touch it? (Ira: I love the Buzzcocks. They are fun to dance to. I may not be able to talk but I can still dance all around the studio.)

THe Fall- CREEP (The Fall was one of the first really awesome dancey British bands that Franz Ferdinand and THe Kaiser Chiefs are following. Gene says that Mark E. Smith was the best punk lyricist. Yay!)

Idlewild- This is Worse (This is off of the I'm a Message single, CD 1)

The Coral- Dreaming of You (I really like this album- it's got an almost middle eastern feel to it.)

Gary Numan- Metal (This came out Gene's senior year in college. It's kind of cool but I kind of think it'd be enhanced by the massive amounts of acid on campus. Gene says he was beyond just acid at that point.)

Ladytron- Playgirl (Look at the last song! Coincidence? I think not.)

"event","I am terribly sorry (and frustrated) that my show didn't exactly happen tonight. Apparently they were doing maintenance on the building (and didn't tell me) and cut off the electricity half through my first song, which was The Ponys. I called campus police since no one was in the building and they said it'd be off until 10. My CDs are still stuck in the decks there and I wasted gas. Next week if I see any men looking like they are going to steal the radio station's electricity, I swear I'll tackle or bore them to the ground."

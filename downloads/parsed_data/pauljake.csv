She is the most wonderful person ever and we are so in love and best friends.  Her name is Johanna.  She's an actress/improviser here in the city.  We were dating about 5 months before I asked, but we were best friends for about a year before we started dating.  I love her so much and we are both thrilled to be spending the rest of our lives together!  So, I just wanted to let you all know in case you hadn't heard.  Hope that everyone is having a wonderful 2008!"

"event","So, last night, I was eating the remnants of a two day old thin crust pizza.  It was good, pineapple topping, just the right amount of sauce, almost cracker thin crust.  I'm chewing on a piece and it suddenly just sort of feels like I've gotten some of the crust stuck between my teeth.  No big deal, I just sort of pick at it and the sensation goes away and I go back to watching ""Curse of the Golden Flower.""  Jump ahead to three in the morning...  I awake to quite possibly the most pain I've ever felt in my body emanating from my tooth.  I mean, like ripples of pain waves made me literally shake.  So, I do the best I can, knowing that I can't go to the dentist for at least another seven hours, I keep downing Advil and wincing.  I couldn't sleep at all, which was a lot of fun.  Then, at 9:30, I started walking over to the dentist's office.  He told me I had chipped a tooth and that he needed to do an x-ray to see if it had uncovered the nerve or not.  Luckily, it only chipped just close enough to the nerve where it was still covered.  Had it been uncovered, they would've had to do a root canal, so thank God for that.  Then, he shaped some bonding over it.  I get to go back next week to get the real piece put back on.  Because I was still in a lot of pain, he prescribed some Vicoden for me... Let me just say, that I've never had Vicoden before.  It totally has put me in a world where I feel like I am so slow, that I am just swimming.  I just woke up and I feel like I've slept for a week (maybe I have what day is it again).  So that is my ""lucky"" tail of for this Friday the 13th of April 2007... fun stuff."

"event","We ended our run of ""Fat Pig"" yesterday.  It's very bittersweet.  It has been running since the beginning of September.  There was this really great closing party with just a small number of close friends.  So that was really nice.  Now that the show is over, I'll be able to actually have a cleaner apartment and cleaner clothes.  It really hit me that it was over today when we were striking the set.  Anyway, it was a fantastic experience that I'd never trade.
The next show at Profiles that I'm helping with is ""Apple"" by Vern Thiessen.  Opening night is April 20th, so we have lots of work to do beforehand.  Tomorrow we are painting the set.  Check out the theatre's <a href=""http://www.profilestheatre.org"">website<a/> for the coolest poster ever.  I'm not stage managing this next one because I'm kind of burnt out on stage managing.  Plus, I want to try and do some more for my acting career...
Not a whole lot else is going on.  My brother graduates from grad school in May, so I think I'll be able to go visit him for that.  I just saw the movie ""The Namesake"" which was amazing.  I highly reccommend it.  I hope everyone is doing well.  Maybe, now that the show is over, I'll be able to make more frequent entries...maybe."

"event","Okay...let's talk about unprofessional for a minute here...  I was called back for an audition for this theatre company today.  I was all excited, it was for a show that I really wanted to do, (Red Light Winter by Adam Rapp) even though I really didn't know the company that well, I figured, ""Hey, at least it is that show.""  So the call-backs were scheduled for today, at 1:15.  I got the theatre a little early and one of the auditors tells me to go ahead and go into the theatre.  I figure, this is cool...I'll get in, read my sides and get out...  No.  When I get into the theatre I discover all of the other actors that have been called back for a second audition...  Ok, I figure maybe they have a separate room or something for us to go into and auditon in...  So I take a seat and patiently wait.  1:15 rolls around and the artistic director  of the company walks in.  He says, ""We've tried many different audition methods in the past and we've found the best one is to have everyone watch each other's read... this way we don't have to give as many notes on what we are looking for.""   ...I was ready to walk out right then.  But my desire to do this particular show was the only thing keeping me there.  I mean, that is how we auditioned for things in HIGH SCHOOL.  There is no way you can expect to get a good audition out of someone if they are forced to sit and watch the actors they are competing with.  Plus, from their point of view, you don't even get to know the person you are auditioning much less test them individually with different notes, etc...  So I ended up reading anyway...  At the end of the auditions when there were just a few of us left, they did the old, ""Paul, can you go stand on stage next to Jenny and Ben...ok, now Jenny, switch with Carla, and Ben switch with Steve.""  Seriously, all I could do to keep from screaming, was grind my teeth.  After this musical chairs casting method my High School Drama teacher used, I was done with it.  I don't care about the show anymore.  This lack of organization and even decency to call people separately into a room to audition is way more than enough to make me know now that I have no desire to do any show with this company.  So, if I do, for some reason end up getting cast, I'm not taking it."

Also, I've been cast in a staged reading of a movie script.  It is on Valentine's Day and I am the main antagonist.  Pretty cool.  It is sort of a film noir type piece set in NYC during WWII.  Anyway, it is just a one night type deal, but should be fun.  Also, it gets me out of the whole Valentine's Day thing, which is ususally just depressing anyhow.  I've been playing lots of FF and the new WoW expansion.  Also, Zelda has been rocking my world as of late.  Oh, yeah, I'm 27 years old now... yeah, I feel like I'm 80.

There was a cold going around the theatre this past weekend, I thought I had avoided it...no...of course not.  I guess the good thing about is missing work.  Of course, this will also be the bad thing about it when I get my next paycheck.  Imagine if you will being congested in everyplace in your head and throat that can be congested.  Then, add a cough and a constantly running nose.  Topped off with body chills and a mild fever...  Fun.  So I am going to stick to the bed for most of today and just try and sleep through this.

There are only 5 more days until I go to Tennessee for the holidays.  I can't wait actually, but I don't want to go home sick.  So, it is back to bed and a grape flavored airborne (shudders).  Why can't they make this medicine stuff packed with sugar or something to dull the taste..."

We did some tourist type things...went to the top of the John Hancock Building (which if you are ever in Chicago, has a much better view of the city than the Sears Tower) and then went out to eat at Ed's (a restaurant that is 50's/60's Diner themed where the servers are rude to you on purpose).  He came and saw the play and then we all went out with the cast and some other friends afterwards.  Sunday, we just sort of hung around the apartment recovering from the late night before and watching football (too bad the good game isn't until tonight).  This morning I drove him to the airport.

My parents came up to see my show on the 4th.  It was great to see them both.  We went out shopping and they took me out to eat around town.  A good time was had by all.  They left on Super Bowl Sunday.  The game this year could have been better, but at least it came down to the fourth quarter, keeping it more interesting than the commercials.  There were really only a few commercials that really stood out as being good.  Like FedEx's Burt Reynolds and Bear Commercial.  Also, I got a kick out of the New Ford Mustang one.  There were probably others that were good, but by now I've forgotten them.  I finished reading, ""Peter and the Starcatchers,"" the Prequel to ""Peter Pan"" written by Dave Barry and this other guy.  It was very entertaining and funny, and even though it is a book meant more for younger reading levels, it was still a great book.  Still no real luck on the job search, but maybe it will turn around soon.  Eh, whatever.  These past few weeks have been filled with a lot of auditions, so not having a steady job, has actually allowed me to attend some of the ones that I normally wouldn't be able to attend.  Hopefully something will come from them...   Survivor starts again on Thursday.  That is definitely something to look forward to.  Then, CBS is having Rob and Amber on the next Amazing Race Series, an interesting gimmick.  Speaking of the Amazing Race, I wasn't too thrilled with who won the last one.  I just thought that the girl on that team was too much of a...spoiled biotch.  My show closes after this upcoming weekend.  It was a good run, but I am kind of ready for it to be over.  I am still working on this Northwestern Student Film.  It is a lot of fun working with them on it, although, at times they can be a tad disorganized.  But standing around is something that actors get used to after awhile.  Well, I hope that everyone is doing alright.  Talk to you soon.

"event","Lately I've been pretty busy.  My show has been running for two weekends now and I thought for sure that I'd get some free time when it opened.  However it turns out that this time of year is really great for auditioning.  Lots of theatres are looking for their spring and summer casts, so instead of resting, I've been auditioning.  Which is fine, I am just using every waking moment when I'm not looking for a job or in a play of some sort to audition.  
This past weekend, also marked the start of my film career.  The filming of the Northwestern Student Film that I am a part of started this past weekend.  I mean, I've done extra work before, but in this I actually have a whole bunch of lines.  Since it is a student film, I don't get paid or anything, but it is a  really good stepping off point.  Lots of the casting directors in town like you to have some sort of film experience before they consider casting you.  Plus I get a copy of the film when it is all done and hopefully the director will go on to be really big and remember me.  If nothing else, it is a lot of fun.  I mean, you stand around a lot waiting for the lights and sound to be all ready,  but I really like all of that too.  
In other news, there is a new big theatre that is being built downtown that held auditions yesterday.  Their first show is going to be, ""The Full Monty.""  Since the show involves characters whose dancing skills aren't necessarily up to par, I went and auditioned for it.  Also, since the big joke is that the audience never sees them totally naked, I figured it wouldn't be too bad to be a part of it.  Of course if I do get a role, I don't know if I would want my mother to come and see it.  The audition wasn't really my best ever.  They wanted a pop/rock song that showed range.  I didn't have the time to prepare anything too ""poppy"" but I just picked a song that had some range from ""Damn Yankees"" and had the guy play it faster.  If anything they got a sense for my range.  The reason I don't think it was the best audition ever, is because
a) they told us that they had been auditioning people all day without a break and my time was at 5pm   b) there was a person there that I did a show with who isn't exactly my favorite person, and this person was talking to me right before the audition which was just screwing up my frame of mind  and finally, c) apparently one of the men in the room had been smoking, because when I got in there there was cigarette smoke everywhere which isn't the most soothing environment for singers.  Anyhow, we'll see if anything comes from it.  If not, there are a bunch of other auditions coming up.
Well, I had better be going now.  I just felt guilty for not posting in so long.  I hope that everyone is doing well and I hope to hear from you soon.  Talk to you later!

"event","My show opened this week :-)  It is a fun show, but definitely not ""great"" theatre like Shakespeare or anything like that.  The show is actually a series of sketches (about twelve in all, and I'm in 8).  The challenge is the quick transition from character to character.  This past week I've been really busy just with all of the dress rehearsals and tech rehearsals.  Now that the show is open, I'll have some free time again.  In fact, I just have two performances today and then I'll be able to rest the next three nights. Yay!  Anyhow, it had been awhile since I last updated and I was starting to feel guilty.  I really can't say that I've been up to all that much other than ensuring that the show opened well.  I hope that everyone is doing really well.  I'll post soon!

"event","One of the more stressful points of the last few weeks has been searching for an apartment.  This isn't exactly the best time of year to be looking.  More property is usually listed in the summer.  Also, nobody wants to move when it can be -12 degrees with windchill (like it was Friday).  So, I made a deal to stay where I am for just 6 more months.  It will be a good thing.  Now I can just sort of take my time finding a place and not feel rushed about it.  So, for now, the apartment thing is off of my, ""List of Urgent Things To Do.""  Now, I just have to find a better Job, Get through this next week (opening week for the play) and Get through the student film that I'm in.  In other good news, I finally beat this boss in Metroid Prime 2 that had been mocking me for the past several days.  Oh, for you Survivor Fans out there, check out the CBS website, the website for the next season is up now with all of the cast members and preview videos etc.  It sounds like another enticing season, although, I'd be happy if they did another all-stars show, just as long as Survivor is on.  It will be great because AR6 will end and then Survivor will start.  Well, I have to be getting on to dress rehearsal numero uno.  I hope you have all had a great weekend.  Talk to you later!

"event","Time keeps flying.  We open the next show that I'm in a week from today.  We had some issues a little earlier in the week with lines, but now we are back on track and should be ready for the opening.  Tomorrow, I am going to be a reader for a theatre's audition.  They are called Noble Fool Theatre Company and they specialize in mainly doing comedies.  Anyway, I will go and read with all of the people auditioning and then they use my readings as my audition.  Also, I get to hear them talk about everyone after they leave the room, which will at least help me understand one casting director in town (one down, 300 to go).  It should be a lot of fun and remind me of the days of Directing class with Jay.  Today, I have no rehearsal, so tonight, I am going to try and just rest and watch the episode of the Amazing Race that is in my VCR."

Oh yeah, I also learned some more lines on the commercial breaks.  I am now officially 3/4 off book. Yay!"

"event","So the snow finally stopped Thursday afternoon.  It was fun, that is until I realized that I needed my car to get to work.  This involved digging the car out from the foot of snow on it, not to mention digging it out from all of the snow that the plows had pushed up beside it.  Really it wasn't too bad, just slightly irritating.  Yesterday, inspired by the movie ""Sideways,"" I bought some Pinot Noir and drank roughly 2/3 of the bottle while watching ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and then, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.""  I also ordered a pizza and ate the whole thing...  Yeah, so about me starting my diet again.  The week has been full of going to see different apartments.  I am ready to have my own place and no longer be burdened with roommates (not that all roommates are a burden, I just want to be able to come home and feel free to do whatever I want without disturbing someone).  Oh, in a slightly exciting note, I had an audition for a Northwestern student film on Thursday and was cast in it.  The role is that of son that is trying to help his dad cope with a death in the family.  It isn't too hard and will give me some film credit for the resume :-)  Today, I have to memorize my lines for the show that I'm in.  I haven't been too good about doing it yet, so hopefully I will be able to concentrate long enough to get it done.  We have to be off book by Monday!  I'm also still looking for a job, but am not as stressed out about it because I have so many other things going on.  I hope that everyone is doing well.  Talk to you soon!

"event","I have basically been lazy all day today.  Today is the last day before rehearsals begin again for my next show, so I have been just resting around the apartment (and every once in awhile, when guilt strikes, I have memorized a line or two from the show).  I am still pretty stressed about the whole job thing, but I am taking it as a sign that Barnes and Noble just isn't where I am supposed to be.  Yesterday I spent the day watching some of the bowl games and today I am watching football too :-)  Anyhow, I hope that you all are enjoying the holiday weekend :-)  Talk to you later!

"event","Happy New Year's Eve!  I am still not feeling all that festive.  I learned today that apparently the manager in charge of scheduling also doesn't like me.  I really don't understand why not.  I do a lot more than most people there.  The way I found out was that one of the other manager's, that I am kind of friends with too, came up to me and started talking to me about the hours thing.  He said that I should, ""probably start looking around for another job,"" because Nick (the scheduling manager) doesn't like me.  I really don't get it.  I don't know if that is true or not but it just makes me even more stressed out about the whole thing.  Anyhow, a look on the brighter side...I have an interview at a job this afternoon at this Kinko's type place.  Hopefully something good will come of it.  It is just a collating job, but it pays really well, so maybe I will end up better off.  Well, I don't want to bring you all down, I just wanted to let you in on what is going on.  I really hope that everyone has a wonderful New Year's Eve.  Be safe and have fun.  Happy New Year's Eve!"

"event","So, I am back in Chicago....  The holidays are still happening everywhere for everyone.  I dunno... I was so happy being at home and I got back here and the very first thing I wanted to do was go back to Tennessee.  Also, my roommate had broken the toilet which just made my mood go from depressed to DEPRESSED.  Then, I called work to tell them I was back in town and that I'd like to get my schedule for the week.  Well, it turns out that they didn't do the sales they wanted this year, so they had to ""let a bunch of the seasonal help go and cut everyone's hours.""  They not only cut my hours they basically made me go from five days a week and 7 hours a day, to one day a week with 5 hours in that day.  So I am basically, excuse the language, FUCKED.  The past couple of days I've spent searching for a new job.  I can't believe that they did that after I've worked there for over a damn year.  So, the next few weeks I am probably just going to be really stressed out.  Also, I have to be off book for the show that I am in now by Monday...wahoo...  Yeah, so I just thought I'd get on here and vent a little bit.  I really hope that you all are enjoying the week more than I am.  I miss you all and wish I was there with you.  For now, I am off to fill out job applications.  Talk to you soon.

"event","Hi everyone!  I hope you had a Merry Christmas!  Christmas was great here.  I got a bunch of DVDs and a couple of video games and a plethora of clothes, so I am all set for another year.  Some notable things, the new Metroid Prime game for the Gamecube, an RPG for the PS2 called Bard's Tale (this game is great because it uses sharp humor and the choices you make in the game influence the outcome of the ending and your personality), Suspicion (one of the greatest Cary Grant movies ever) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  The only bad thing is that I don't have any more time here.  I have to fly back to Chicago tomorrow morning.  I really don't want to, but I guess I can't spend life just living off of mom's cooking and watching television...  This past week just went too fast.  Hopefully I will get to see my family again really soon.  When I get back to the city, I start back at work on Tuesday as well as rehearsal.  Yep, I have actually been cast in another show.  It is called ""Oy!"" and it is actually a collection of really short plays (twelve in all).  It should be a really fun show.  I get to play eight different characters in eight different plays.  The cast is just made up of five people and we all play the various roles of each show.  It should be quite a challenge to develop all of the characters and I like everyone in the cast, so it should be a really fun production.  I think that after this show, I am going to take a little bit of a break.  I've been going for awhile and a break would be wonderful (of course if Mr. Spielburg wants me to be a part of his next blockbuster movie before that time comes, I would have to say, ""Yes!"").  Well, I hope that everyone who celebrates it had a lovely Christmas!  Talk to you soon!

"event","Hey everyone!  I'm in Tennessee this week for the Holiday.  I think I've already regained about 4 pounds from all of the food I've eaten.  It is great to be here doing nothing.  Well, almost nothing.  My brother told his girlfriend that he was going to make something for her for Christmas, which has turned into a whole fiasco about what he is going to make her, how he is going to make it for her, etc.  So, I've been helping him use what limited power tools we have to make a nice little cabinet for her.  If she doesn't like it, he also bought her a necklace.  It was about 20 degrees here the other day, so I guess I brought the cold air down with me from Chicago.  Tonight we watched ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""  Yes, I still watch that...  Yesterday, I went with my family to see ""Meet the Fockers.""  I kind of want to go to NYC now and buy a boot leg copy.  It was pretty funny and there were only two or three times where it was slow.  I would have to say that if you are in the mood to laugh that you should go see it.  I hope that everyone is having a wonderful Holiday Season so far.  Have a great Christmas Eve and an even better Christmas Day!  Talk to you soon.

"event","Nothing much is really happening around here, but I wanted to update anyway.  I am all excited to watch the last episodes of Survivor.  I will be watching yesterdays today sometime and I probably won't get to watch the finale until the day after, but I definitely have checked hundreds of times to make sure my VCR timer is in good working order.
I guess I do have one exciting thing to report.  I don't know if any of you remeber Hank and Andrea from the Improv shows.  Well, I was up in Evanston the other day having lunch and as I was walking out of the Panera Bread Co., there they were walking down the street.  They are married and Hank is going to school at Northwestern for his Philosophy Degree.  We didn't have time to really talk, but we exchanged info, so we will probably hang out sometime.  So, that was pretty exciting.  You just never know who you will bump into.  Well, I hope that everyone is doing well.  I am just counting down the days now until I can go to Knoxville.  Until then, it is annoying customers doing their holiday shopping at Barnes and Noble.  I don't know why people become so aggressive when they are doing holiday shopping.  You'd think they'd be nicer because they are filled with thoughts of buying their loved ones presents...that is what you'd think.  C'est la vie.  I hope that everyone is having a great week.

"event","So today is my first day off since Thanksgiving.  What are you going to do with it? you may ask.  Laundry.  I haven't done Laundry in absolutely forever and my closet is almost filled with it.  So, I have decided that today is to wash any and every piece of dirty laundry I can find whether it be in my room or my car.  I really haven't been up to that much in the last week.  I went to Thanksgiving at my Aunt's and met both of my cousins' fiancees.  They both seemed nice and I am invited to the weddings, so that is nice too.  Anytime the thought of being able to travel for a couple days arises, I am always excited about it.  I get to go visit my parents for Christmas soon, so that will be nice...nice to get away and rest some more and of course have the famous, ""Mrs. Jaquith Turkey.""  Depending upon how the rest of this year goes, audition wise and such, I may actually start applying to Graduate Schools again.  I think it might be a little bit easier to get in this time around, since I have some more ""real world"" acting experience under my belt.  Eh, who knows?  I haven't totally decided that I will or not, but it has been slowly but surely coming back into my mind.
In other news, I loathe my new bank and will probably be switching banks soon.  Oh yeah, I was hoping to be able to get some people's addresses.  If you read this, please e-mail me your address at pauljaquith@hotmail.com.  I have moved twice over the last year and right now I can't find my regular address book.  Thanks everyone.  That is all for now.

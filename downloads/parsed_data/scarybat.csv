This song rules. I want a tape of me dancing to it. It's right smack between sexy and hilarious.<br>
I think the guy next to me in the computer lab was flirting. I should have started a conversation. He wasn't bad.<br>
I rented two movies. American Beauty (Which I've seen before - it's great!), and Taxi Driver.<br>
So yeah, skipped spending $6.50 to watch Kill Bill to stay home where I can lie down, and get up and dance if I feel like it. Haha.<br>"

OK, so the play wasn't bad.<br>
I rented ""Titus,"" since I've never seen it and the preview I saw looked bitchin'.<br>
I might go see Kill Bill II tomorrow, since I don't have to work and I only have one class, then my radio show 1-3. So... I have to check times. Only prob is, I have no one to go with. *sniff* Any of you guys wanna go w/me?! Hopefully there's a 3:30 show or something. That'll work just right for my impatient ass.<br>
My theme song:<br>
Coal Chamber - Something Told Me<br><i>
Something told me to tell you
Not to tell me what to do

Why do you do the shit you do?

No, not what I want to do

I was going to bold the parts I found particularly relevant, but then it would just all be bold. Everything in that song speaks to me. Fuck - some people suck so much ass.<br>
I'm in a decent mood though, if my mom doesn't steal my car to get a matress home. Geez.<br>"

Cold, late night so long ago
when I was not so strong you know
A pretty man came to me
I never seen eyes so blue
You know, I could not run away it seemed
we'd seen each other in a dream
Seemed like he knew me...he looked right through me...yeah

""Come on home, girl"" he said with a smile
""you don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile
But try to understand...try to understand
Try, try, try to understand...I'm a magic man""

Winter nights we sang in tune
Played inside the months of moon
""Never think of never...let this spell last forever""
Well, summer lover passed to fall
tried to realize it all
Mama says she's worried...growing up in a hurry

""Come on home, girl"" Mama cried on the phone
""Too soon to lose my baby yet, my girl should be at home""
But try to understand...try to understand
Try, try, try to understand...he's a magic man, Mama...ah...he's a magic man

""Come on home, girl"" he said with a smile
""I cast my spell of love on you, a woman from a child""
But try to understand...try to understand..
Oh...oh....try, try, try to understand...
He's a magic man...oh...he's got the magic hands

""Come on home, girl"" he said with a smile
""You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile""
But try to understand....try to understand

She never mentions the word addiction
In certain company
Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan
After you meet her family

She paints her eyes as black as night now
She pulls those shades down tight
She gives a smile when the pain comes
The pain gonna' make everything alright

Says she talks to angels
They call her out by her name
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name

She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket
She wears a cross around her neck
Yes the hair is from a little boy
And the cross from someone she has not met
Not yet

(Repeat Chorus)

She don't know no lovers
None that I've ever seen
And to her that means nothing
But to me it means, means everything

I'm reading, ""A Brief History of Time,"" by Stephen W. Hawking.<br>
Fascinating stuff.<br>
The concepts are big, but it's written for a non-scientific audience, and the writing is actually very simple. He's explaining the progressing theories from Aristotle to the big scientific players such as Newton and Einstein.<br>
I like the theory on causation (prior actions in time cause reactions later in time) and the expanding universe. That if the universe is expanding, it's obviously not static, and if it is expanding, at one point it was smaller, and, logically, it had to have a starting point, since the process can't be reversed in the same way it's progressing now, and work out. In other words, if the universe is getting progressively larger, you reverse that process to see what it was like earlier in time, and find that you can't make the universe infinitely small. It had to start at one point, at one size.<br>
That was my own explanation, it made more sense in the book, I think.<br>
I'm trying to grap the concept of what exactly they mean by the ""ether"" (a substace -not air- that exists everywhere, even in ""empty"" space, through which light waves travel). So light waves through ether is comparable to how sound waves travel through air. However, Einstein said that you didn't need ether (it might not exist) if you don't believe in absolute time. Also, that you can't travel faster than the speed of light, if that is even possible.<br>
It's all just really good stuff. I haven't been able to stop thinking about physics since I started thinking about it a few weeks ago. I just borrowed the Hawking book this morning, I can't wait to read more.<br>"

     One day, when you wake up forty, drunk and heading for a little hair of the dog that bit you, I hope you think of me. I hope you think about how you fucked people over and realize your pathetic excuse for a life is your own fault.

Yesterday sucked. I had a migraine from about 10 AM yesterday to 11 AM today. Finally rid of all but a little lingering squeezing.<br>
I didn't really get to hang out with ole Spooky. The hideous boss-beast made him work a double. So I ended up driving him to the bank, pharmacy, stopping at the toy store, and back to work. This was just as well, since I could hardly see or keep my eyes open, it would have been a short night anyway. He thought I was mad at him, but really I was just sick and too sick to properly explain it.<br>
He scared the crap out of me by squeaking and squealing. I thought he had lit himself on fire with his cigarette. Turns out he had just seen the copy of Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 sitting there on the seat. I rented it from the video store. I told him I'd lend it to him, if he gets it back to me by early next week.<br>
I had better go. I need to get ready for work at 4:30. Now that I'm getting hours again, I love my job. It rules.<br>

I visted Adam for a few minutes between class and work. He says his super juju bracelet is working for him. I'm happy. I couldn't get him out of my car... he made me five minutes late for work. It was OK though.<br>
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. I haven't really hung out with him in days, and I'm picking him up after work and we're gonna go eat or whatever.<br>
Steve asked me if I knew any Wiccans. Sounded like a bet. Haha. I said I did, that it wasn't quite my thing, but filled him in on some details. He says his wife is interested. She sounds more like the type that should just start out with some herbalism, rather than converting to a quasi-religion. Not my say, just my opinion.<br>
Work kicked ass. I started to feel a lot better. I made $29 in sales incentives. Yesterday I made about $26. The paycheck they arrive in will be SWEET, that's for sure.<br>
There's a couple songs I can't get out of my head. Marionettes - Absolution, The Mission U.K. - Neverland, and Bauhaus - Stigmata Martyr:<br>
<br>
In a crucifiction ecstasy 
Lying cross chequed in agony 
Stigmata bleed continuously 
Holes in head, hands, feet, and weep for me 

Stigmata oh you sordid sight 
Stigmata in your splintered plight 
Look into your crimson orifice 
In holy remembrance 
In scarlet bliss 

In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum 
In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum 
In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum 
In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum 
Father, son, and holy ghost 
Stigmata Martyr 
<P>
My translation:
In the name of the father, both of the son and of the sacred spirit.
<br>
Now there's a complete sentence - or not. Something about the case seems off. Patri is a 3rd Declention masculine noun, which means with the ""i"" ending, it's dative, which is a direct object. Shouldn't it be genitive?! Grrr. His pronunciation is fairly hideous too. Haha. Probably learned church-Latin. Oh, the shame. Still a fab song. I think I'll drag that into class tomorrow and make Witucki translate it. She'll know.<br>"

So I worked last night. This dude Lonnie... wow. OK, he's older, and I swear. He tells me he might be leaving for another better-paying job. I can ONLY HOPE he leaves. I think he likes me. He's doing that ""close-talking"" thing that freaks me. You can tell he fancies himself a ladies' man.<br>
The funniest thing? He looks SO MUCH like the southern guy in ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"". Now that Adam's hair is a little longer, he looks like a young skinny John Cusack. I want to put them together and be like, ""NOW ACT OUT THE MOVIE!"" LMAO. Great.<br>
I'm planning to do a block of old blues tomorrow on my show as a tribute to Black History Month. I was planning on playing two or three songs and matching them up with modern rock song that were inspired or influenced by them. Everyone is quick to divvy up ""Black"" vs. ""White"" music, and there's a lot more cross-influence that you might think. It's also unfair to call it ""stealing,"" since immitation is flattery, up to a point.<br>
Oh well.<br>"

Hmmm... so today I went to classes and worked. I should be studying reflexive Latin pronouns and other such sundries for my test on Friday, but it's so much more fun not to - but I NEED to.<br>
I blew the speakers in the booth today. That was fun... thankfully it wasn't permanent. I had them at full blast, I could feel the vibrations in my lungs, it was great. Suddenly, nothing. The needles on the board were still moving, so I assumed we were still broadcasting, that it wasn't the deck that went down. I overloaded the speakers. Nice.<br>
Tomorrow I have to talk to the guy. Hopefully he doesn't do anything to piss me off, because in that case I just won't say anything, and we'll be set back. So... we'll see.<br>"

I figured it out. I'm not asexual, I'm just English.<br>
Anywhos. I think I figured out my confusing situation. I'm through with Chris - he totally burned me today. I saw him up at the mall, he went into Hot Topic with his friends, and I went in after him. I said hi to Corey, one of the dudes that works there (and you know this girl can be LOUD when she wants to be), and so he MUST have seen me there. Didnt' say hi, didn't come over to see me. So fawk you too. You may be the hottest piece of teenage ass in three counties, but you can't be ignoring me and getting away with it. That's just so much less playtime for you, fancypants.<br>
I gave Adam a ride home. I stopped at BK to get one of those chicken things I like so much (FIVE GRAMS OF FAT!!! THEY'RE SO GOOD!). I bought him a strawberry shake and he disturbed the entire restaurant laughing hysterically at my Hyer-jokes.<br>
In other news: I think one of my professors likes me. I mean, he's very good-looking <i>FOR HIS AGE</i>. That says it all right there.<br>
Anyways. I'm probably getting a boyfriend on Thursday. (Haha. I sound like I'm going to the grocery store.) I've known the kid a while, we have fun, and he's been liking me lately, so I think I'm going for it.<br>
This kid Rob checked me out today - totally looked me up and down (I did look nice today). Haha. I worked with him briefly; he was seasonal help. So I saw him up at the mall, chatted with him a bit. He's very funny, cocky in an endearing sort of way. I ditched him to stalk Chris (that hot loser skater boy). He's cute, but I dunno. I'm going with this other guy (who's hair has been looking nice lately)."

Ok, this is going to be an essay-style rant about a subject I can't seem to get off of my mind lately. If (lack of) sex offends you - scroll away now.<br>
SEX SEX SEX<br>
It's all anyone thinks about, so it would seem. What's the traditional line between friends and boy/girl-friends? Sex, right? Even if you're not actually doing it, it's an implied ""not doing it <i>yet</i>"".<br>
Theories on the rare people that don't care, or don't care very much, range far and wide. Most modern psychologists assume there's simply a problem with the individual, it's a disorder. Maybe they were traumatized when young, maybe they're a repressed homosexual (itself considered a disorder not long ago). Proponents (mostly members) of the asexual theory insist it's all right, and doesn't mean there's anything <i>wrong</i> with you, it's just different.<br>
""...the definition of asexuality is 'No or low sexual attraction to other people' (http://www.asexuality.org/bigfaq.htm#def1)"".<br>
I'm coming to terms with the horrifying fact that this might be me. I remember being about 6 years old and my mother giving a non-detailed speech about sex, and me wrinkling my nose and saying something like, ""Ick. I don't ever wanna do that,"" and she assured me that one day I would. Well, I'm 21, and I can't say a whole lot has changed. Sure, <i>in theory</i> I like sex. I understand why people do it. I also know almost no one turns me on, and in the end it's just too big a bother. You get in a relationship with a guy, and it's just understood there's going to be sex sooner or later (preferrably sooner). Then, you sleep with them, and next thing you know it's all you can do together, everything is just a lead-up to sex. Am I weird for feeling there should be more to life?<br>
The one guy in AGES (we're talking years here) that I felt a definite sexual attraction to (even after getting to know him a little) just doesn't seem to be interested. It would be a supreme irony if he's asexual. There are lots (not to brag) of guys I could have in an instant, but I look at them, and just feel grossed out. Some of them are nice-looking too. I can understand aesthetically, he's a cute guy, but when I think about touching him I just get icked out.<br>
It just seems so easy for everyone else. They find someone they have virtually nothing in common with, who isn't even that good-looking, and they fuck (pardon my French). They seem to find this normal and okay. I pick every tiny detail apart until sex seems like the most retarded thing a pair of people could do.<br>
Well-meaning friends tell me I just, ""need a boyfriend,"" but why should I expose myself to lecherous groping I'm just going to find gross and then have to dump the guy?<br>
This is my dilemma. Sure, maybe it's a phase and I'll grow out of it, but it's been a fucking long phase.<br>"

Remember that 2 1/2 page paper I had to write in about 2 hours? The one I didn't research or anything? I got it back yesterday afternoon. I got a 4.9 out of 5, which makes a 98%<br>
HAIL TO THE MASTER!<br>
I am the procrastinatrix. I'm getting good at it.<br>
Today I have to check and see if that job is my new job or not. I need to stop at my current job and see what time I'm working tomorrow. I think it's 9:30 (VOMIT!), but I'm not sure.<br>
I'm probably picking up Adam and taking him to the store to cash his check. At this point I'm tired and would rather skip it, but I promised and now he's probably planned on it. Blah.<br>
All kinds of new guys are in love with me. Well, more like crushes, but none of them interest me. I guess none are cute... It sucks - the ultimately hot ones are first of all, extrememely scarce. Then, if you find one, they tend to be stupid and/or dreadfully conceited. I'm gonna die alone: (<br>

I can't stop eating.<br>
I eat and I eat and I eat. I guess when I was sick, it helped me to stay focused on not fainting or whatever. Now I'm in a bad habit. Getting that damn non-beer beer gut back. GARH!<br>
Today's show was HARD. Man. I went in there with no idea, just a wallet of CDs and a few in jewel cases. I played some of the stuff in the studio too. I'm gonna post the setlists when I get around to it. I played an hour of goth/metal/rock and then about forty-five minutes of 90's rock. Then I played The Bad Touch. Haha.<br>
So I have to talk to someone tomorrow, and I can't make up my mind what to say. I guess we'll see.<br>"

I think I could be really sick...<br>
What the fuck does it mean when your limbs won't stop going heavy and light, and you get all dizzy, you feel like you're sinking even though your ass is firmly in the chair, and you can't seem to regulate your own damn body temperature? It really doesn't sound good. I suppose I'm dying or something, but I have no money to go to doctors. If I tell my mother, she'll just tell me I don't eat right and stuff vitamins down my throat like a cat.<br>
I'm hoping it's just stress. I know my life doesn't seem stressful, and I guess it isn't, really. I create stress for myself.<br>
She's been into bitching me out for not being home all the time. I hate it here. I really just need to move out, but I can't seem to get a steady job, or a roommate, or anything other than stupid crap.<br>
I went to classes. I guess my radio show went OK. I fucked a few things up, but overall it was OK.<br>
I gave Adam a ride home from work. We laughed over stupid shit for a good two hours.<br>"

Today is busily sucking ass. Bummed as all hell. Was gonna go out later (pick up Adam/go to library for research), then changed mind. He called to tell me he's getting a ride from Curt.<br>
I guess he's worried about me, so he had his mother call me. I couldn't really talk. I didn't have the phoneline and that cell costs me big bucks.<br>
If I thought there was nothing after death, I'd probably just drive off a bridge. Life is way too hard, and kind of pointless when you really think about it. However, I know the afterlife will be equally, if not more fucked up. My choices: earth-trapped soul (aka Ghost), hell, weird parallel dimention, ect. Existance sucks.<br>
Trying to put together my setlist for Monday. I'm bored with the songs already. I have about 47 minutes, not even half my show. I think I should plan it out, this being my first show and everything. I'll probably get lots of calls bitching about it and asking for Outkast. *sigh*<br>
On the bright (if you can twist it that way) side, I have a job interview on Tuesday. It's 20-30 hours at $6.50 an hour. Decent. Not perfect, but good enough. My right arm/hand is still all fucked up. Like to know what the hell is wrong with it.<br>"

I keep getting booted every few minutes. Sucky computer.<br>
Well, today I went to classes. More dumb blonde bitches to contend with, making their dumb little noises and rolling their eyes.<br>
I got out and went to the radio station. Learned a little. Doesn't look overly complicated, but it will take me a bit to get it all down. Adam is already bugging to be let into the studio.<br>
Might have an interview at the video store.<br>
I picked up Adam and took him to the grocery store and we grabbed something to eat. About halfway through I just got so bored, I got really bummed out. He bugged me until I told him parts of what's bothering me. 
<br>Just about everything in the universe is bothering me, and now I have to choose between two guys, and the field is all foggy. One's really cool, nice-looking but not really to my taste, and the other is insanely good-looking, possibly a moron, and I'm not sure he even really likes me. Well, I know he likes me, but I'm not sure he ""likes"" me. I don't want to hurt either of them. I'm not dating either of them now, so do I owe a rejection-notice to the cute stupid one if I don't pick him? We only hung out a few times, and I'm not sure he's fully absorbed that I was hitting on him...
<br>Maybe I'm just not cut out for a relationship. It just seems like too much for me, I can never work it right. It always just ends up making me more miserable and stressed."

Wow. Today was just wrong.<br>
I got to class a half-hour late, because I got stuck in the snow.<br>
I got done with class, called Adam, picked him up. We around some places, including Off Centre Records, where they have an upstairs loft FILLED with ""collectables,"" aka toys. There were so many Dracula things I wanted, and a Death from Sandman figure. So so cool. I didn't buy anything. I was sort of proud of myself.<br>
I need a new job so bad.<br>
So we were going to hang out with ATM. Adam sprung some stuff on me that really upset me. He's OK, nothing horrible happened, but it just kind of threw me. He just has a knack for upsetting me. Good thing he's my best friend.<br>
Wow. Next Sunday's FOX shows look good.<br>
I have to research and write a 2 1/2 page paper in 1 3/4 hours tomorrow. Thaaat's gonna suck. Hope I can get it done.<br>"

I'm feeling some serious negative vibes, and I can't seem to shake the dizzy-spells.<br>
I'm not even gonna do my Latin homework; I'm just going to go to sleep and hope that most of this is tiredness and stress. I only got about 5 1/2 hours of sleep last night, which wouldn't be all THAT awful, except I've been stressed about some stuff. I took a B-complex vitamin pill tonight.<br>
I called Chris today. He *might* come down to the mall tomorrow, and he *might* come down Thursday, because he wants to see Butterfly Effect. I highly recommended it... perhaps I can invite myself along? The weird thing was, he had been sleeping when I called. Do you know how weird it is to talk to someone you arn't all that close to, and you woke them up? It's very... personal somehow. I kept picturing him half-dressed and touseled. It made it hard to concentrate. Who the hell sleeps at five in the afternoon anyways? Adam, that's who! Haha. All my friends are just clones of each other...<br>
Work was stupid. I only did two rolls of film, and the dude hated them. WELL, that should tell you not to C-41 process ""black and white,"" film. If you were REALLY Mr. Know-It-All-About-Photography you would KNOW that already. *sigh*<br>

Today I went to classes. I got out and Andy text-messsaged me to tell me he was coming to the mall. So I met up with him and his friend Derrick. Wackiness ensued.<br>
I picked up Adam and was going to just drop him off, but he was really hungry, so we stopped for food. We laughed so hard over such stupid shit he finally seriously suggested that perhaps my car is old and therefore leaking carbon monoxide.<br>
I dropped his skinny bum off and headed back to the mall to look for other cronies. I didn't find who I was looking for, but I did find Antoine. He was on his break, so I went back to WalMart to talk to him. We talked a bit, it was cool.<br>
I tried calling Chris again, but no one answered. I hope he doesn't have call ID and is ignoring me... but then, why would he have told me I could call anytime? Eh. I dunno - I get all insecure like.<br>
I guess I'll try to catch him tomorrow or Wednesday."

I called Adam, but his mom was half-asleep, and he was sleeping, so I didn't get to talk to him. I called Matthew, and he was good. He's all moved back in, and seems to be doing well.<br>
I tried to call Chris; he wasn't home. I guess his house is like, party central. Everytime I call, someone new answers. This time it was a teenage girl. Probably one of his brother's friends, I don't think he has a sister. Eh - I miss his weird ass, haven't talked to him in ages. Maybe I'll try to call him again tomorrow if I don't run into him at the mall.<br>

Do you prefer to date people younger, older, or the same age as you?: Younger, but if someone is really cool, I'll go a few years older. A FEW, not like, 10.
Do you listen to songs on repeat often?: Kind of.
Who was the last person you hung out with?: Adam. 
What did you and that person do?: Movie, food, book store, and I dropped him off at his apartment.
Do you use internet shorthand (i.e. ""lol"", ""brb"", ""jk"", et cetera)?: A little bit.
How often do you bathe?: I shower every day I go out, and wash my hair around three times a week.
Are you a people-pleaser?: I *can* be. That's a big ""when I feel like it"" there.
Do you dye your hair regularly?: Nooope. Want to dye mine black though.
What about your eyebrows?: Dying your eyebrows is extreme.
Do you wear makeup?: I do. Usually a little light powder and black eyeliner. If I'm going all fucking out, I'll wear powder, liner, shadow and mascara. I'm all about the eyes.
If you answered ""yes"", to #96, are you female?: Yep.
Do you buy CDs edited or unedited?: Unedited.
Can you beatbox? Haha. Reminds me of this dude Tony. He was the human Beatbox. Fo' shizzle.
Does your mom like the song ""Hey Ya"" by OutKast?: I can kind of imagine her liking it, I don't know if she does."

Wow. I have THE largest spot on my face. It is horrible.<br>
Today I went with Adam to see <i>The Butterfly Effect</i>, which he hadn't seen yet. It rattled him a little, but then it rattled me the first time I saw it. We grabbed some food and went to Barnes & Noble. I'm reading some book about High Ceremonial Magick and laughing my ass off at the illustrations. He's reading his toy and horror movie magazines. Then I got him going on this massive joke that Amy was going to call up a demon and make it show customers the LVS. Adam is all like, ""It's not gonna,"" and I'm like, ""OH YES IT IS; because it's afraid of Amy. She a much higher demon.""<br>
So we had a good laugh imagining all these cartoonish situations. Like, the demon doesn't know who Toby Keith is, and has to ask Curt, and all this stuff. An old man heard us and was laughing and trying to get in on the joke. Haha. It was great.<br>
I feel much better than I did yesterday. I was so incredibly drained yesterday. As I sat in the theatre today, I felt connected. I'm not sure how many people will understand this, but sometimes I get ""floaty,"" like I'm not very well grounded in my body, and I dislike the feeling, because it makes me nervous. It's like when you're JUST about to fall asleep, but all the time. IT SUCKS. Then again, some people are way TOO grounded in their body, to the extent they nearly ARE it. I have wandered far far off any kind of track here.
<br>Anyway, today I called Matthew to see how things were going with him, and he's fine. He was moving out, and his mom made him get off of the phone. Poor kid... he's gonna hate the whole loss of freedom thing. However, I was glad nothing weird was happening to him. Good luck Matt!

My fish just died. I got home just in time to see his last few minutes. It was so fuckin' sad - he tried to get up and do his little dance for me... He just died like five minutes ago. I think my sister (accidentally) killed him. He looks scalded, like his scales are peeling. Like, I know she was just trying to help him, but I think she probably put a huge bag of really hot water in there, and maybe he got trapped behind it. Oh well. Good thing I took a picture of him while he was still alive and well. It's blurry - water doesn't photograph well:<br>
<img src=http://img9.photobucket.com/albums/v24/gweniscool/fish.jpg>
<br>R.I.P. little fish, you were much loved in your short life.<br>
I didn't sleep well last night. When I finally slept, it was like it didn't do anything. I woke up very tired.<br>
I was so freaking tired I just wanted to lie down and go to sleep anywhere.<br>
I hung out with Adam for a while, but it wasn't much fun because I was so sick and drained. I wanted pizza, but there was waaay too much garlic on it. I'm going to be even sicker now. I want to just throw up, but I'll also throw up the Excedrins, and I don't have any more.<br>
These last few days have been just awful.<br>"

Remember yesterday's entry? Well, yeah, it hit the fan. It was big, it was bad, but I kicked its ass (Matthew helped - good job Matthew!).<br>
All's well for now, but I am sooooo drained from the experience.<br>
I know I kind of tease you all putting this here and not saying what, but it's a very long story, very weird, and no one is going to believe me if they haven't seen it. It's fuckin' X-Files level shit.<br>
In other news, I'm pretty much in as a DJ. I feel cool and special.<br>"

So a new disaster is on the rise. All us ""sensitive"" people are now set on edge, waiting for the bomb.<br>
I saw another one today. This one had a faint red glow to his eyes if you caught it just right (no, he was not wearing those contacts). I haven't seen one since summer, that I was sure of. Some people just give me a slight tingle - this kid was a 2x4 to the head. I felt bad for him. He couldn't have been 14 or 15. I always want to do something, but I'm never sure what. Break out the Portable Exorcism Kit in center court?<br>
My fish is doing loop-de-loos. He's so crazy. I cleaned his tank, I guess he's happy about that. OH YEAH - I almost forgot. I finally named him (I assume it's a guy, I don't really know). His name is Ville, because it's a Finnish name. FINnish! GET IT?! Haha. Always with the puns.<br>"

I love this song:
<P>
<i>
Still night, nothing for miles,
White curtain come down,
Kill the lights in the middle of the road
And take a look around.....
It don't help to be one of the chosen
One of the few, to be sure
When the wheels are spinning around
And the ground is frozen through, and you're
Driven, like the snow
Pure in heart
Driven together
And given
Away to the west
A white dress
'Til the river don't run
A black dress
Looking like mine
'Til the sun don't shine no more
Where the sky meet the ground
Where the street fold round
Where the voice you hold don't 
Make no sound, look
Snow on the river and two by two
Took a lot to live a lot like you, I don't
Go there now, but I hear they sung
Their <b>""Fuck Me And Marry Me Young""</b>
Some wild idea and a big white bed, now
You know better than that, I said,
Like a voice in the wind blow little crystals down
Like brittle things will break before they turn
Like lipstick on my cigarette
And the ice get harder overhead
Like think it twice but never never learn... 

And the mist will wrap around us
And the crystal, if you touch it... 

And the cars
Lost in the drift
Are there
And the people that drive
Lost in the drift
Are there
And the cares I've 
Lost in the drift
Are there
Theirs, ours,
Lost in the drift
Are..
Driven
Driven together
And driven
Apart </i>

- Sisters of Mercy ""Driven Like the Snow""

Anyways. Went to class, visited Adam & The Curt-man at FYE, went to my work. Drove home. No biggie.<br>
I'm writing a new short story.<br>
Drawing a new picture.<br>
Going to call Chris this weekend and hassle him about letting me photograph him.<br>
Thinking about signing up to be a DJ at the college radio station.<br>"

So today I read this book, ""Still She Haunts Me,"" about the bizarre relationship between Lewis Caroll (author of <u>Alice in Wonderland</u>) and the little girl he based Alice on. Rather Nabokov-ish in nature, even though it seems he never actually does anything to her. I didn't feel like paying $12.50 for it, so I just sat in B&N and read it in an hour or two.<br>
I went back to the mall and wandering into Spencers, where I found a Niobe action figure from the Matrix movies. Adam is gonna pee. He'll give me the money for it, so I grabbed it. I remember him kvetching about wanting one, because it's supposedly the rare one, <i>only one per case!</i> Gah - I've been friends with him so long... I know too much. I called him and his mum today, and updated them. He was highly indignant at the pet-store-dude incident. I was like, ""...and he was all like, 'Can I call you?' all like we're gonna fricken go out for malted milkshakes. Like, what the FUCK do you know about me?! I'll <i>malted milkshake</i> YOU!"" The people nearby looked at me, AS IF they haven't heard that threat before. Haha. So Adam said if he managed to get my number and calls, just to tell him I have to go hang out with my best friend. Hahaha. His Mum was getting all worried, like she thinks he's a psycho. I was like, ""Noo... I don't think he's dangerous."" LOL. She's such a sweetie.<br>
I saw Butterfly Effect yesterday. I can honestly say that is the best movie I have seen in ages. It's just so good, not even Ashton Kutcher could ruin it, and I thought he might. I'm just so used to seeing him play dorkuses, it's hard to take him serious. Plus, he just looks like a skinny Hyer (and we all know how hilarious I find the antics of Hyer, human monkey). GREAT plot though. WOW. I'm gonna see it again.<br>
I had bizarre dreams last night. I think I'm using one as the jump-off for a twisted short story. Also, I need to draw this one thing I saw the night before. It's really messed up, like Hellraiser meets Tim Burton.<br>"

My mom is SO WEIRD.<br>
Ok, so I had to go with her to drop my car off, because otherwise I'd have to sit in the lobby of the car place for five or so hours. We went to this pet store where she had to exchange something. This dude asks me if I need help, I asked about their selection of newts. They had some Japanese Firebellys, but no Eastern Red Spotted, which is the one I think I want. Not that I'm buying now - maybe in the summer.<br>
Anyways, next thing you know my mom's in on the conversation, and she's talking to him, and next thing I know I hear, ""You like her?"" and I'm all, ""OH SHIT.""<br>
See, she really doesn't want me to date, but at the same time, she wants to be in on the descision.<br>
The guy is 29, and I'm not sure he had eyebrows. I like my guys to have eyebrows.<br>
He was a nice-seeming guy. Totally loves animals, which is cool, but even had he been drop-dead goodlooking - TWENTY-NINE?! That's almost 30, and 30 represents a whole different bracket. Thirty is marrying age, thirty is having kids age, thirty is In-Ten-Years-I'm-Gonna-Be-Middle-Age. NO THANKEE. So, spurred on my mother, he asked if he could call me. I thought hard, totally spaced for a moment, and said I was really too busy to hang out. He backpeddled quickly. I felt bad for the guy, but I'm not running a charity service, yanno?<br>
So yeah, thirty is too old for me. If anything, I go for the younger ones; )<br>
The older guys get, the less cute they get, generally speaking. They're about as cute as they're ever going to get at around 17-19, then it's usually downhill. How sad.<br>
All the guys at my college are hideous - big lumpy jock types, for the most part. I've seen a couple guys that look nice, but nothing really wowing, and I'm not sure they speak too much English. The only people that know how to dress themselves arn't from America. More sadness.<br>
Mmm. So for the rest of the night I hung out with Matt at the mall. He tried to molest me some more: Lester the Molester. I don't think Matthew takes my interest in Chris seriously just because he's a little younger. That's kind of stupid, Matt's only 19. I also don't think he <i>gets it</i> about how I'm interested in a guy, and I'm not gonna do stuff with other people while I'm trying to get him. Also, not going to do stuff with other people after I get him, if I get him. That's just how I am, I don't like cheaters. Plus, if he found out, and he probably would, it would totally fuck things up, and I really like him so far, so I don't want that.
<br>I'm all on about this boy, all the time, to anyone who will listen. Yeah, I'm becoming <i><b>that</b></i> person. The more I talk to him, he calms down a little. He's been all over the place. When I first met him, like at the store, he was pretty calm, used to ask me about bands and where stuff was. Then this fall when I started showing an interest in him, I think that rattled his cage, because he got real hyper and weird everytime I'd try to talk to him. Must be nerves. Now, I think he's getting used to me and/or trying to play it cool. Once we can actually have conversations, I'll see if he's smart or not. I think he might be. I'm so excited. SQUEE.<br>
Like, I hate talking on the phone, and I actually want to call him.<br>"

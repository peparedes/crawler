"event","<p><br>When I'm not penning my thoughts down either in this journal or in my diary, I have a thousand thoughts. And I have a million of them. But when I'm sitting down and actually want to sort them thought out, they all fly right out the window, leaving me alone.<p>&nbsp;</p>I'm beginning to not know what I'm feeling anymore. In the past, when you were a figment of my dreams, I'd console myself saying that it's better things are non existing in the way that I want them to be since things were already so complicated with us just being friends. With how V felt about me and how you felt about her. And these grey areas. I did not know how to thread around them back then.<p>&nbsp;</p>Fast forward a year. After all's that happened between us. Everything that I had imagined that happened between us. I still don't know how to thread around things.<p>&nbsp;</p>Everything that I wanted, minus the fact that you did not love me. We did everything I ever dreamt of. Just that I was on a a one way street but in all those dreams, it was 2 way. <p>&nbsp;</p>Mikey was chatting with me talking to me about Is. Being the third person does put things in a better perspective to judge and act accordingly. But when you are one of the two parties involved, where does all that reasonable judgment and level headed ness go to? Suddenly you don't care about yourself and what you are going through.<p>&nbsp;</p>All that matters is them. <p>&nbsp;</p>And how much you want to help them. How much you want to be the shoulder that they cry on. How much you want them to come looking for you to share their sorrows. How much wiping those tears away means to you. How much making them laugh, even for a little bit in that moment, would mean to them. And how much you want that moment to freeze when they place their grief stricken heart in your comfort.<p>&nbsp;</p>I don't know how to act around you when you shut me out. You go into a mode that puts all your walls up and suddenly you are defensive and snide and sacarstic and what not. I get that you need your space. Just tell me nicely. I've thought about when you said I can be overly sensitive sometimes. I've thought about it and you know what, I don't agree with it. How am I supposed to know what you really are like when you are mad or when you are angry when I've never seen that side of you to compare it to. I have seen you worked up and I can definitely differentiate that from your normal self. But this isn't about that.<p>&nbsp;</p>I just don't know how to get back in once you lock me out. I don't even know if locking me out is because of me or...what is it because of? I really don't get it. <p>&nbsp;</p>That night after Pump Room, you initiated a make out. 5 minutes into that, you started crying. Then you broke down and told me what you felt about Sunday. Why do you do that to yourself, Baby? You know I'm always ears, all the time, all for you. And for the record, I wish you had told me that you were going to meet V that day. Till today, I don't understand how we both ended up in the same store that day, right before you met her. There I was thinking that you were at the centre and suddenly, there you were, in the very same shop. It's not like I would have stopped you from going.<p>&nbsp;</p>And when you explained to me that night. About how you didn't tell me coz firstly, you knew V wouldn't be happy if she knew you told me and secondly, coz you think that it's better to keep personal things to yourself, it hit me. You are never gonna move past V. You still put her first interest even though I've been the one around you. That says alot. <p>&nbsp;</p>It's so hard to digest how close you were to me but were never mine. What we shared in February and March. You let yourself go to me. For a whole 3 weeks, you were just mine. I still see you beside me on my bed. I still see the look in your eyes when you looked at me with all that warmth in your eyes. I ask myself how could that have meant nothing to you when it felt nothing but sincerity to me? At the end of it all, I think that's what I cannot accept. That you were never mine and until now, there isn't a name to what we shared. And maybe, still share. <p>&nbsp;</p>I hope I find the strength to get the both of us out of this rut. Me being stuck in it, that's choice. But you don't have to be dragged down in this bullshit as well. I know that it's just pure courtesy that you're still around coz you think I can't handle it alone for now. Why would you think otherwise when I was a wreck all those times you decided to move away. So for your sake, I hope I find the strength somewhere. Greater things await you. And I will not be the reason that holds you down. <p>&nbsp;</p>After alls said and done, I still love you.</p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

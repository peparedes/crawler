And no it wasn't dead bodies, the city under water, <BR>or the sludge everywhere. It was PEOPLE""S BEHAVIOR. The people on T.V. (99%<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">being Black) where DEMANDING help. They were not asking nicely but <BR>demanding as if society owed these people something. Well the honest<BR>&nbsp;truth is WE DON'T. Help should be asked for in a kind manner and <BR>then appreciated. This is not what the press (FOX in particular) was <BR>showing, what I was seeing was a group of people who are yelling, <BR>demanding, looting, killing, raping, and SHOOTING back at the demanded <BR>help!!!!! So I'm thinking this can't possibly be true can it???? So I <BR>decide to submit to the DEMAND for help out of SHOCK. I couldn't believe <BR>this to be true of the majority of the people who are the weakest of <BR>society. So I went to volunteer and help folks out and see the truth. So I <BR>will tell the following story and you decide:<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;I arrived at the astrodome only to find out that there are too <BR>many volunteers and that volunteers where needed at the <ST1:PLACE w:st=""on""><ST1:PLACENAME w:st=""on"">George</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACENAME w:st=""on"">R.</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACENAME w:st=""on"">Brown</ST1:PLACENAME> <BR><ST1:PLACETYPE w:st=""on"">Convention Center</ST1:PLACETYPE></ST1:PLACE>. As I was walking up to the Convention Center I noticed a<BR>line of cars that wrapped around blocks filled with donations.<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;These where ordinary Houstonians coming with truckloads and <BR>trunks full of water, diapers, clothes, blankets, food, all types of good <BR>stuff. And lots of it was NEW. I felt that warm fuzzy while helping unload <BR>these vehicles of these wonderful human beings. I then went inside the <BR>building and noticed approximately 100,000 sq. ft. of clothes, shoes, <BR>jackets, toys and all types of goodies all organized and ready for the <BR>people in need. I signed up, received a name badge and was on my merry way <BR>excited to be useful.<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;I toured the place to get familiar with my surrounding; the <BR>entire place is probably around 2 million sq. ft. I noticed rows as far as <BR>the eye can see of mattresses, not cots, BLOW UP MATTRESSES!!! All of which<BR>had nice pillows and plenty of blankets. 2 to 3 bottles of water lay on <BR>every bed. These full size to queen size beds by the way where comfortable,<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">I laid in one to see for myself. I went to look at the medical area. I <BR>couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing!!! A makeshift hospital created <BR>in 24 hours!!! It was unbelievable, they even had a pharmacy. I also <BR>noticed that they created showers, which would also have hot water. I went <BR>upstairs to the third floor to find a HUGE<BR>&nbsp;cafeteria created in under 24 hours! Rows of tables, chairs and food<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">everywhere - enough to feed an army! I'm not talking about crap food <BR>either. They had jason's deli food, apples, oranges, coke, diet coke, <BR>lemonade, orange juice, cookies, all types of chips and sandwiches. All the<BR>beverages by the way was put on ice and chilled!!!! In a matter of about 24<BR>hours or less an entire mini-city was erected by volunteers for the poor <BR>evacuees. This was not your rundown crap shelter, it was BUM HEAVEN.<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;So that was the layout: great food, comfy beds, clean showers, <BR>free medical help, by the way there was a library, and a theatre room I <BR>forgot to mention. Great stuff right????<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;Well here is what happened on my journey - I started by handing <BR>out COLD water bottles to evacuees as they got off the bus. Many would take<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">them and only 20% or less said thank you. Lots of them would shake their <BR>heads and ask for sodas! So this went on for about 20-30 minutes until I <BR>was sick of being an unappreciated servant. I figured certainly these<BR>&nbsp;folks would appreciate some food!!! So I went upstairs to serve <BR>these beloved evacuees some GOOD food that I wish I could have at the <BR>moment!<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;***The following statements are graphic, truthful, and discuss<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;UNRATIONAL behavior***<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;Evacuees come slowly to receive this mountain of food that is <BR>worth serving to a king! I tell them that we have 2 types of great deli <BR>sandwiches to choose from - ham and turkey. Many look at the food in <BR>disgust and DEMAND burgers, pizza, and even McDonalds!!!! Jason's deli is <BR>better than McDonalds!!!! Only 1 out of ten people who took something would<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">say ""thank you"" the rest took items as if it was their God give right to be<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">served without a shred of appreciation!!! They would ask for Beer and <BR>liquor. They complained that we didn't have good enough food. They refused <BR>food and laughed at us. They treated us volunteers as if we<BR>&nbsp;where SLAVES. No not all of them of course...but 70% did!!!!!! 20% <BR>where appreciative, 10% took the food without any comment and the other 70%<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">had some disgusting comment to say. Some had the nerve to laugh at us.<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;And when I snapped back at them for being mean, they would curse <BR>at me!!! Needless to say I was in utter shock. They would eat their food <BR>and leave their mess on the table... some would pick up their stuff many <BR>would leave it for the volunteers to pick up. I left that real quick to go <BR>down and help set up some more beds. I saw many young ladies carrying <BR>mattresses and I helped for a while. Then I realized something...their<BR>&nbsp;where hundreds of able bodied young men who could help!! I asked a <BR>group of young evacuees in their teens and early twenties to help. I got <BR>cursed at for asking them to help!!! One said ""We just lost our ****ing <BR>homes and you want us to work!!"" The next said ""Ya Cracker, you got a home <BR>we don't"" I looked at them in disbelief. Here are women walking by carrying<BR>THEIR ****ING BEDS and they can't lift a finger and help themselves!!<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;WHY THE **** SHOULD I HELP PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO HELP <BR>THEMESELVES!!!!<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;I waved them off and turned away and was laughed at and more <BR>""white boy jokes"" where made at me. I felt no need to waste my breath on a <BR>bunch of pitiful losers. I went to a nearby restroom where I noticed a man <BR>shaving. I used the restroom, washed my hands and saw this man throw his <BR>razor towards the trash can...he missed... he walked out leaving his <BR>disgusting razor on the floor for some other ""cracker"" to pick up. Even the<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">little kids where demanding. I saw only ONE white family and only TWO <BR>Hispanic families. The rest where blacks...sorry 20% to 30% decent <BR>blacks... and 70% LOSERS!!!!!<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;I would call them ******S, but the actual definition of a ****** <BR>is one who is ignorant, these people were not ignorant......they where <BR>ARROGANT *******S. The majority of which are thugs and lifetime lazy ass <BR>welfare recipients. We are inviting the lowest of the low to <ST1:CITY w:st=""on""><ST1:PLACE w:st=""on"">Houston</ST1:PLACE></ST1:CITY>. And <BR>like idiots we are serving the people who will soon steal our cars, rape, <BR>murder, and destroy our city while stealing from our pockets on a daily <BR>basis through the welfare checks they take. We will fund our own <BR>destruction.<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;By ""US"" I don't mean a specific race, I mean the people who work <BR>hard, work smart, have values and morals. Only people who want to help <BR>themselves should be helped, the others should be allowed to destroy <BR>themselves. I do not want to work hard, give the government close to half <BR>the money I earn so they can in turn give it to a bunch of losers.<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt"">&nbsp;I don't believe in being poor for life. My family immigrated <BR>here, we came here poor, and now thank God, and due to HARD WORK we are <BR>doing fine. If immigrants, who come here, don't know the language can work <BR>and become successful... WHY THE **** CAN'T THE MAJORITY OF THE HOMEGROWN <BR>DO IT!!! If we continue to reward these losers then we will soon destroy <BR>our great country. I just witnessed selfish, arrogant, unappreciative <BR>behavior by the very people who need help the most. Now these same people <BR>who cursed me, refused my cities generosity, who refuse to help themselves <BR>are DEMANDING handouts on their own terms!!!!!!! They prance around as if <BR>they are owed something, and when they do receive a handout, they say it's <BR>not good enough! Well you know what.....these<BR>&nbsp;types of people can go to hell for all I care!<O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT></P>

So 2 day later i met him. Thats when everything happen. The day we met each other was amazing.... 2 me. we were talking and took picture, he walk me 2 my locker &amp; class. Then his friends told me he supposly had a boner when he saw me. So days past by and everything seemed perfet. We began holding hand &amp; stuff. &amp; i ask him if he like me &amp; he say i don't know. Then again we barely met so i understood. So weeks past by and ppl told me not 2 like him becuz he a asshole. I didn't belivie them. So yeasterday i saw him and i ask him if he likes me. He said I don't know. I was like u have 2 weeks! by now u should know if u do like me o not! He said i don't know... again. So i was like just tell me the truth. his friends said ""say yes 2 her!"" (in spanish). Then he said probably .... no. Ouch! did that hurt me o wat! I thought everything was going perfect but I guess wrong. I should of listen 2 my friends. I got my hope up 4 no reason. My friend told me they any ask him if he did like me and he said i don't know ... i think about it. &amp; they said its better 2 tell us now becuz &nbsp;if u don't like her u wouldn't bring her hopes up. He said i knew u were going 2 tell her! &amp; their like yeah.. duh she r friend.&nbsp;&amp; He like don't wry about it i'm going 2 think about it and he smile. &amp; when he was talking 2 my friend the while he said&nbsp;i don't know was more like the i don't know teasing meaning yeah i kinda do like her. &amp; do u want 2 know who this guy is... it's Alex, David, o watever has name is.

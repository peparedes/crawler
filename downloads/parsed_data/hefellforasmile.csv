this heart hurts so bad
so fucking bad
 all the stress
free of love 

well i know you love me but it's like you're the only one.
fuck.

there is so much more out there.
        i keep telling myself that.
keep looking there is more. that hug is so nice but the kiss is so different.

but there is more

more than back stabbing friends. more than any bitch who can't be straight with anything. fuck, here we go. vent vent vent all over again.

get me out of this state. tennessee is a shit hole. no open minds! no open hearts!
i mean come on, who puts ham in their veggies. asshat motherfuckers do. fucking hics.

I'm wearing your shirt.
do you really care?
i only wish it didn't smell like me now.

i feel like memories will never fade.
can we kill them all?
no
 then where will we go from here?

more tattoos peeling. this is for life..... hahah this makes me laugh so hard to even think anyone has a clue what forever means. they break so hard and no matter how over it you are the memories and dreams still remain.

narcissistic fuck. that's all i am.

I don't want to be forceful, this is why I attempted to keep my distanceand tried to give up space between myself and another back in October. I'm only trying to make the best out of what we have, and sweetheart we don't have much time. alone in your room, all i want to do is sleep next to this smell of you and regret time wasted, time lost. Sorry I can't be everything. I can't always be first. I'm still not even sure if today if I'm number one. but you're not second and that's all i know for now. where is the trust in all of this because honestly I think it's missing. when will you fully trust yourself to trust me. 
I full tank of gas and and a carwash is all i can give her right now but maybe some day I'll have something better to offer.

I have to keep moving I can't stop here but the waves and kisses goodbye are going to cut like razors, I can't stop in this state and sit... the beach is calling and I'm getting tired of these hills. Milwaukee was all and more I had wanted it to be, best friends and brand new ones. my heart goes to the people i met and old friends with new handshakes. hugs and kisses are always nice from trustworthy hands. I'm already missing them. 

I love my *best fucking friend* so much! It seems like I can talk to this person about anything. from this super hot boy she's falling for who i know likes her :wink:(fucking go for it. ryan's a total sweetheart) to what type of food i like and my girl things. it's good to have such a rad person like this in my life.

If only you could have seen the way the scalpel reflected light on the wall as it cut me.
It was creepy. 
So I turned my head.
All I could see was blood soaked rags leering back at me.

Yes, I like Jooley. I've liked her since I met her about 2 years ago. She's a good friend and an awesome person. ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

I will hunt her again in July.

Draining me until I'm dry.

The wind
my shivering
I want you to hear every drop that falls off of my face
every breath.
The alarm signaling to no one.
Why do I have a heart?
Do you see the black muscle 
the black missel
it's sweating, swelling and looking for you
my hips are sore and these bombs seem like they'll never heal
Stop Laughing At Me, I just want a hotel room
FUCK COLORADO
4 feet of snow keep me from wrapping my eyes around a black widows throat
(6 inches an hour)
I hope all my words get to slice her ribs
she will bleed 
just like she bled me
the innocent are full
fed by lies 
feed the liar
yes she is poison, they all are

stop giving it to such wonderful people

Whooooa here we are once again.
Shit I'm too full of too much.
I would give you all my heart if I could.
But I know at least 78% of you would just loose it in the seat cushions.
But this boy has the hartt of a car.
Why do I continue to write this shit. Haha.
I mean we all know it sucks but I still write it.
I guess it feels so nice to vent.
Familiar arms are so warm.
And you. Yes you.
I feel so damn bad for you.
Don't you see what you're getting yourself into.
You're gunna get yourself hurt.
We all know you seem to fall into the arms of cheating lies.
I wish I didn't care.			
I hope they make fun of your beliefs too.
How many of you know what it's like to miss?
Miss everything you ever touched that you will never touch again.
And neglect everything you could have if you would just reach for it.
Man this is so tragic.
Who keeps forgetting? I envy you.
God I want to forget.
Forget it all.
Do any of you know what it's like to go through life knowing that you're immortalized on your friends body?
That shit is not easy to deal with.
I mean I love him too so maybe I should get his name on my ass..........
Maybe not.
While I'm on this topic I should give this stripping thing a little more thought.
What am I getting myself into. 
I need the money but who doesn't.
I don't want to be a part if this.
Haha this just hit me.
He still thinks I'm gunna kill him.
What a jackass.
I can't believe I got locked up for that shit.
They were his guns.
But the bat, knifes, and brass-knuckles are mine.
Oh man I can't wait to wave goodbye to this drama.
And all the other drama.
Livejournal is DRAMA-O-RAMA
I really don't like the internet.
I don't want to be involved in so many peoples lives.

***Wait!!!!.................................................

What happens if I die?? What if something happens to me?? Who's gunna tell my buddy list????***


""NO I DON'T WANT TO CYBER!""  Leave me alone.		
I just don't feel like it.
I want to cuddle.
This screen really isn't getting me any warmth.
Maybe I'll sit closer.
Where will I be in 5 months.
Homeless on the streets of Orange County missing Autumn.
Or Homeless on th streets of LA missing last winter.
Weeee life is a party and I never want to put down this bottle.
Will I ever get sick of water.
I keep wanting to run away.
So I do.
It feels so good to be away, to be on the run.
So I'm running again on Wednesday.
But I keep coming back to you.
You motherfucker!
I'm so sick of you.		
(This sounds like a great part for a breakdown)
WOW hate is bad.
But i have a lot of it in me. 
Did I really say never.
That's so long.
But I mean it.
I hope one day you will walk to me and say sorry.
Only so I can spit in your face.
I hope your eyes rot out.
They keep getting to me.
What happens if May rolls around with nothing done?
Will I just leave this chapter open while writing all the new ones.
Agg my life is way to full right now.
My car.
My baby.
My love.
I don't want to loose you.
Six more days
Just six?
Why aren't I on the road?
Driving angry is such a great idea.
Fuck art f***. 
Fuck you if you're taking sides.
If you're taking that side, fuck you
If you're taking mine, fuck you.
This past drama is not something I want splitting friends.


<hr>



to any of you who wasted their time to read this, I'm sorry. I love you.
to any of you who just scrolled down their friends list, on to the new crush or something better, I love you.


I'm just wondering who took the time to read this... if you did please reply, you don't have to say anything more than ""here"" or ""me"" whatever because you know way too much about me and what's going on in my life right now.

Hope, faith, justice and karma have failed me.
I can't trust anything I believe in, it's all bullshit.
I ordered meat last night at the diner.
The people around me were the only reason I didn't let it get to the table.
As of 2am today my life is fading into a dying lonely void.
I don't know where I'm going but I'm going.

Clearly the sun hates me.
Why won't it let me sleep?
Let me be where I don't dream.
Where false hopes can't touch me.
I wake up alone and hate the cold.
I want to sleep for days so my eyes don't have to open and see ***** *****."

"event","The last wish of a dying man.
Handed over in a diner.
He's not expecting his wish to be granted.
After giving out a taste of an old friends medicine. 
Not intentionally but simply because of his pain.
Forgiveness is worthless if no one will forget.
So forgive and forget, and wrap a few wounds you inflicted. 
Or we will die one friend short.


One friend short is not loneliness but it's still not easy."

Don't they see she lies.
Don't they feel the poison in that breath.
My blood dried a long time ago.
But why am I still being cut at.
Cut away.
I never want to see that pouting face again.
Unless I can help a smile up there.
Sick of trying.
Take it slow, in my ass.
Nothing said is total fact.
Whops you miss that part.
Did she mention that she kills.
Did she mentions she runs back and calls me attached.
Take me to Providence.
So I can be warm.
Take me to Omaha.
Where I can dance with a knife.
Bring Nashville here. 
To kill at mile high.
New Mexico is where we all see visions.

Being left alone and happy is only in fairy tails.
But this is where fairy tails end and nightmares begin.
Where mom tucks you in.
Covers binding you so that you won't squirm as you scream out for help.
When a child's eyes bleed from all that he's seen.
I see the truth now.
And it has set me free.
Someone so willing to speak behind a computer screen but not face to face.
I have no comment (to be posted).
Someone is trying to see something that is not there.
Looking into a heart that is nothing short of tortured.
That's where you will find only what you seek.
It's clear that someone is looking for an insult.
I bet there are people out there that would take this as directed to them.
Selfish.
Don't make me about you.
My heart is is growing.
There is a smile on my face quite often.
Until I see another discontent face, then I want to bleed again.
Be happy for me.
Because you have no clue what I have in my hand.
There are no pictures this time.
The camera is rolling.
One day someone will find the footage.
Because no matter where you hide they will always find you.

I wanted to die.
There I would lay alone thinking of her in company of a superior.
Someone to treat her better.
She can reach anyone she wants.
I would rather see that smile, than silence with violent undertones.
Temporary infractions, you couldn't tell your closest friend.
The shit I did to forget her and I'm glad she's fading.
I hope no one takes advantage of the situation.
She is a beauty that I wouldn't want darkened anymore. 
Make her smile.

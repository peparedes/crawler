so today was christmas assembly. AND like many I was hoping our present was yellowcard. Hoping and hoping and hoping. BUT nope it was a basketball lady. I don't know what you call her profession. She was like a female Harlem Globetrotter. Yea, I mean she was very talented but still what a way to end the year. 

Anyways, has anyone started the Physics report? Yea not me. Hopefully I can get started tonight. 

Hm, I'm thinking of leaving the world of livejournal.

I think I'll be pulling an all nighter tonight..

- the physics test. ::crosses fingers:: hope i did well.

Here's a few interesting convos:

Me: you have an F+ in hw in calc
CJ: a 47 isn't even an F..
Me: Maybe they'll give you a G ::chuckle::
CJ: thanks..::laughter::
Nat: you go from D to F so it's E because you skipped E
::me and CJ look at each other strangely:: *nat looks confused*
::SO MUCH LAUGHING::

Jrose: Elysa doesn't want her roll
CJ: What is her...""roll""?
Me: I don't even know the meaning of that phrase in chicken and ribs
CJ: I don't get it
Me: Her bread..roll?
Me: Apparently you don't know the meaning either.
::LAUGHING::

s p u n k y CEEJ: LOL i didnt get it...i was like roll? she doesnt want to roll? where we rollin? ---> that was my thought process

s p u n k y CEEJ: BE THERE or have 4 perpendicular angles

Well, today was interesting. I ranted all about it in my xanga, but it's private so sucks for you. Anyways, today my leg hurt hardcore man. Hopefully by tomorrow it'll feel better. On another note, I got a 10/10 on my calculus quiz. It totally made my day. What else? Oh it was junior ring ceremony today. It was nice today to see all the juniors get there rings. It made me feel all nostalgic and all that nonsense. The priest presiding over the mass had the coolest accent. It made the homliy so much more interesting. Hm, today was kinda kickback. Everyone kept asking me if I was okay. Thanks for caring, to those who did ask. I appreciate it more than you know.  To those who only laughed it off, I thank you for making me feel like crap. THANKS! =) JK..haha. We got pizza for lunch. yum. At the KIWIN'S meeting, we had a speaker come talk about cystic fibrosis. The video was so sad. It made me and cj want to cry. I can't wait till the Bowl-A-Thon. It's gonna be fun. Um, is it wrong that I <u>really</u> don't want to dress up for Halloween. I'm not into that stuff. Sounds sad, I know. Crap and they made this new rule that pajamas are NOT a costume. Haha, it's true, but I would have really liked to come to school in pajamas. So comfortable. Hey KC, you're the greatest friend. Thanks for being there. I know this seems random, but I feel like I don't tell you that very often. So thanks. OK, anyways...I have things to do and places to be. Till next time. =)"

Gotta start studying for my SAT IIs. dammit, i thought i was free. after we all ate at BJs. If i seemed bitchy sorry, that test took alot out of me. hm, then after 2 and a half hours at BJs we went to the park. it was fun just lying in the grass laughing about stupid stuff. we were there for four hours man. we need to do that again. um, then we went to my house and watched a weird, disturbing, stupid movie! thanks steff! :) jk haha. everyone went home. and i went to sleep, after getting started on some hw.

today, i did the rest of my hw, watched swimfan (i don't know why, but i can watch that movie ALOT..it's the speedos i think, hahaha), cleaned room, watched my shows.

"event","my day was just way too long. I got up around 5am. BAH! it should be illegal. got my mom to work around 6:30. went to school, driving as slow as i could, still making it to school at 6:50. AND i got Del Taco. So after eating i just chilled in my car trying to do my physics wrksht. Eh, didn't work, so i decided to just wait. It was practically my last class anyways. So as i was in ""deep concentration"" nat ran up to my window and scared the crap out of me. So we have a party in her car. We head back to Del Taco cuz she's hungry. And Vons wasn't open yet. Hm, wow it was going great so far. Oh well whatever. A Block we graded the rest of the test. I got an A. wootwoot. And then B Block...the longest lecture ever. IN HISTORY. seriously. In C block, i got my calc test back. Dammit i hate notation seriously. I got 10% off my damn test because of it. Went to the Boston University meeting. I love Boston. The cold weather, the city, the..everything. I wish i could go there. Hm, then D Block watched even more Hamlet. I love this book, seriously, it's so freaking good. The movie isn't that bad either. Kenneth Branaugh(sp?). Very good actor. Makes me wanna watch all his movies. Then lunch. The board meeting. We got ice cream. Yum. I gotta make a new flyer for the pop tabs. I need to edit a few things. Hmm, then in physics he didn't collect the worksheet. In F block we ordered our senior sweatshirts. I can't wait to get them. And Jrose thanks for teaching me the math and for letting me copy your notes. Oh and Jrose and I are palm pilot buddies. wootwoot. Got home, talked to steff. Now i'm here. well i need to finish my homework and i wanna go to bed early tonite, so later!"

Then Olie arrives. Oh man another laughter filled morning. So I get to A Block and Mr. O moved the religion test <b>again</b> wootwoot. Lemme say I hate physiology. Ok, let me rephrase that. My teacher is boring so I end up hating the class. And then I had english. We started Hamlet. God my english teacher just loves to hear herself talk. Went to physics, it was whatever. Got this impossible worksheet. Hmm, then @ 12 left to go to the <b>Boston College</b> meeting. Man that is my dream school. If I could go there, I will be so incredibly happy. It's just perfect. It's in the suburb about 30 to 35 minutes away from the city. AND they have a school of nursing. WOW. that meeting made me speechless.  During the meeting Mrs. Charles got stung by a bee. Damn those bees. Government was same as usual. I got a 92 on my test. I am very proud of myself! wootwoot. Calc...got back another quiz. ARGH! Test is Thursday, hope i do okay. Steff was here.

We talk, laugh, talk, laugh, and so on. And then Nat closes the trunk door on us. So miss thang (olivia :D) won't open the door for us. LOL. Pure comedy. Man, they're just great cuz they always make me laugh and smile. haha. Um, Mr. O cancelled the religion test. Well, he didn't technically cancel it. He forgot the test at home, so he had no choice but to move it. I love senile old people. :) Physiology, I hate this class because I am not doing well. I think I have a B. GRODY BRODY. British Lit, we are finally starting <b>Hamlet</b>. What great timing, just as the other classes are finishing. I love it. Physics was great because I actually understand. And i'm doing pretty good in that class. I am quite proud of myself. In Govt, our test was pretty easy. I was so frikken surprised. I hope I did well. At the KIWIN'S meeting we picked our sweatshirts. They are mucho cute. <b>YOU WERE RIGHT OLIVIA.

She was looking for color contacts. The color contacts weren't that expensive. Only about $40. BUT the eye exam was $75. So we leave and we try the Swap Meet on Nogales. No one had any, BUMMER. AND we couldn't ask very many people cuz they didn't speak much english. On the bright side she found this really cute purse, and i found this CUTE CUTE wallet. FOR $8. <b>I LOVE BARGAINS</b>. Hm, what else? Everyone sat on me. Let's just say i feel very violated. Um, hm, <b>OKAY</b>, i feel as though i was a little mean to a certain person yesterday. IF i was I apologize. I didn't mean to be, it's just that i'm still a little mad. Anyways, after everyone left yesterday me and nat headed to the West Covina Mall. We went to the new Hollister. Oh I want that <b>WHOLE</b> store. Being in there was like heaven, haha. Then we went to American Eagle. Nat found a cute shirt. I tried on this CUTE CUTE skirt. I want it. It was $48. So i am waiting for it to go on sale. AAAH! can't wait. All that mall needs now is an Abercrombie and Fitch, and it would be perfect. Nat also got some cute stuff from hot topic.

So I get home, and I go to my room. I turn my cell phone on, and I got a text from Edgar. It says and I quote, <i>""Haha, not 2 gloat or nething but just wanted to let you know dat yellowcard wanted to play at my school. Dats so freakin awesome!!""</i> Hm, well first I though he was bullshitting me. Then he called me. And then my jealousy began. Hm, I wish yellowcard would play at our school. But I highly doubt that Sister Monica would allow such music. But if they did that would be kick ass. Therefore, Bosco is kick ass. 

I got my calculus test back. Well, I got the grade back. I got a 79. One frikken point from a B. Don't get me wrong. I am very happy with my grade cuz I thought I did worse. Now THAT was the highlight of my day. Everything else was just a bunch of crap. First of all, I didn't study for my english test. <i>It is my fault, I know this.</i> So I left three blank. GROSS. Oh and BECAUSE of that test, I didn't get to go to the Pomona College meeting. Then because I COULDN'T miss my calculus lecture, I could not go to the Scripps College meeting. <b>Dammit.</b> Oh and you know what else. I missed the cut off for the second KAIROS. So me and CJ are gonna party all week while EVERYONE is gone. We are then going to party on the third KAIROS. But anyways, tomorrow HOPEFULLY my cable will be fixed because I am going through some <s>major Degrassi withdrawal</s>..hm. ANYWAYS, I have hw that should have been done hours ago. Later.

I got to school and me, nat, and olivia had a party in her trunk. <i>hm, sounds weird when i say that out loud.</i> We talked and laughed. The usual.

<b>A BLOCK</b>
Mr. O wasn't there so i reviewed for my calculus test. I was 15 minutes into my review when he walks in and gives us an assignment. <i>dammit</i> But as I get started on that, Mrs. Charles walks in. Saved By the Counselor. :) She talked about financial aid and all that college stuff. <b><U>STRESS</u></b> Hm, tomorrow I'm going to the Pomona and Scripps college workshops tomorrow. Sounds interesting. My dream college is coming next tuesday. Boston College. I have no chance of getting in, so I am living vicariously through the workshop. One day i WILL live on the east coast!

<b>B BLOCK</b>
Mrs. Robl is boring. Physiology is boring. We collected money for Cathy in this block. That was nice. I have a test on thursday. Naaastay. 

<b>C BLOCK</b>
::DUNDUNDUN:: My calculus test! It was easy, but I know for sure I made tons of DUMB mistakes, so I am hoping to God that i at least got a B. The test was long. I didn't have time to check ANY of my work. GROSS. Therefore, I think I failed. <i>sad day huh?</i>

<b>D BLOCK</b>
Mrs. O was in  crabby mood today. All we did was take the Vocab Test. I think the most i missed was six. So I think i got a B+ on it. Hopefully. 

<b>E BLOCK</b>
Mr. Kays gave us the long, tedious, boring worksheet. I never graphed so much. Oh physics is just SO fun. hmm, I didn't notice, but there was drama going on. Interesting huh?

<b>F BLOCK</b>
Longest lecture ever.  B O R I N G. Oh and you know what else. I hate people who talk like the just know EVERYTHING. When in reality, they DON'T. They just make themselves look stupid.

Hm, my day was pretty boring. We got our senior surveys today. There were questions about our senior privileges. The priveleges we DON'T have. Do you know how sad that made me feel? lol. Hmm, hopefully soon we'll be getting those. Anyways, I've got things to do and places to be <i>(not really)</i>, so later."

Dee-lish. Afterwards we were off to English Springs Park. Chino Hills needs some reception up in there. Everyone started arriving for Natalie's fundraiser. Let's just say the fundraiser was QUITE fun. :) I cracked an egg on Nat and also put whip cream all over her face. AND I was being nice. She was quite NAAASTAY after (luv ya nat!). So after she cleans up, me, her, and rob went to puente hills mall. We ate lunch. Yum. Nat mentioned a very embarrasing moment of mine! lol. Now rob has something he can use against me. DARN. ack! don't you dare get me that perfume thing. We watched the My Boss's Daughter. It was HAHA-hilarous. Oh God, natalie, the owl is a bird. HAHA..JK. Then me and rob played black magic with natalie. Took ya a couple minutes huh? Then we walked around. We went into pac sun. Nat found many monkey items. She was pleased. Then we all sat down and just talked. Nat and Rob told many lame jokes that I, of course, laughed at..ALOT. Then after two whole hours of talking, we headed to borders because he said he had a gift card to, which he didn't use when we were there. lol. We read magazines, which was interesting. And once again YOU ARE NOT giving me that perfume. And then we went outside and walked around then entire mall practically to get to nat's car. Oh classic moment of the day: Rob's reaction to the ants. lol...right nat? haha and then nat took me home. The pieces of advice you need to take! Never take it from the side or behind!

"event","first of all..let me say what a waste of a day...

anyways..the first day was basically going from one class to another and going through the same lecture (i.e. what we're doing next week, rules, and UNIFORM RULES)

I AM SCARED OF PHYSICS...i am more scared of physics than calculus. that surprises me

my dad got mad at me cuz apparently it's summer and i should have been home...and not out with my friends :(...that's gay

good side of the day:
-parking in the lower lot
-i have classes with all my friends :)
-being a senior
-going to the hat and chillin with my buddies
-chillin at steff's house with all my buddies"

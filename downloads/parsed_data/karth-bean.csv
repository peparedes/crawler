"event","Here are some sad quotes!

it started with her taking my clothes, then my make up, then shoes, and now it's my boyfriend. well, thats one way to keep it in the family. love you 2 sis!!

The hardest thing in life to do is to watch someone you love, love someone else.

My girlfriend told me to meet up with her at the movie theater. She said it was some kind of emergency. I knew that girls were uptight when things like this happened, so I got her a big bouqett of flowers and a box of chocolates. When I arrived, she started to cry. I asked what's wrong, and she says...""I love you, but this isn't working out....""

Roses are red Violets are blue Garbage is dumped And so are you. hahahahahha (laughing is from me)

The worst part about looking at u is u dont even look back.

sometimes I wish the good times would just rewind...... *over and over*

Yeah. .they are all kinda sad i guess. But I like them anyway."

Math is always pretty grand. Me and Angela have loads of fun .Today she was trying to tell me something without opening her mouth so nobody else could understand.. I couldn't even understand. HaHa. LAnguage sucks bum. All we ever do is grammar and now we have to write a story that starts with ""a funny this happened on the way to...."" ITs so annoying. I cant think of a funny things. any suggestions? In Gym we played football but we didnt want to so we talked about ghosts.. so spooky. I'm so excited for Halloween. Brandon is so annoying. In french he kept on moving my desk back and forth and talkign and being so annoying. Si I went to the  back of the class. What fun! My parents are trying to quit smoking.. cold turky. They are quite cranky and its very annoying! Urg! I had so much homework. Blast all teachers.

I had Kaitlin over the night before last. HeHe we came upstairs and my
brother was sleeping on the chair and it was really funny. His lips
were all puffed out! Me and Kaitlin laughed for so long. Then we went
and ate some icecream. What Fun! The next day we went for a walk and
found a really cool tree/bush that was like a fort. It was so great.
Then Kaitlin bought me cookies. What a good friend. Today I visited my
grand parnets and it was quite boring. Their cat got me all covered in
hair. Thats all for now Folks.

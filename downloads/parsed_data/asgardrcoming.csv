"event","So&nbsp;I was looking into taking my next little adventure to Moscow, Russia. I was reading up on what the us government says about traveling to Russia.... the following is a quote from the travel.state.gov website.

""Males of conscript age (18 - 27 years old) who are deemed to be Russian citizens may experience problems if they have not satisfied their military service requirement""

So my question is what happens if for some reason someone mistakes me for some russian citizen with a really bad accent and then they decide that I have not paid my debt to Russian society. I end up in the Russian military, next thing u know they give me a gun.... and that just would not be good. 

ok... that is enough random thoughts for now..."

Went to manitowoc last night just for the hell of it... nothing going on there eaither.
oooh yea .. Toronto was great.. it was a pain in the ass getting into the country (somehow a signle male traveling alone to a really cold place durring canadian election times looks suspicious to Canadian customs.) Oh well. 
All in all it was a great trip even if it was just for the hell of it... no real purpose or anything just to relax...

"event","so I can't really tell if this weekend was good or bad. its hard to judge on whether the many bad things of it outweigh the many good.  friday was a scandal. the beginning was waaaaaayyyy fun, just us being our crazy squatter selves.  probably too many people showed up, but oh well...then the neighbors called the cops, and taryn and jay and friends hopped the fence and brian and matt hid under katies cops. people are paranoid androids in westlake! but it was all good and it was fun. except at around 2 when travis and i stupidly decided to go to jack in the box, both too drunk to realize it was a bad idea. we got pulled over, and as travis stood out of the car talking to a cop about being drunk and stoned, i talked to another one about who knows what. but somehow, i have nooo idea how, we got out of it. it really shook me up though and i got back in a really bad mood with no one to help me except katies room, and nora. next day, audrey barb and i went to the beach adn although it wasnt the sunniest, it was definetly a good time. we acted like we were 5, and it was fun. sand fights. water fights. girl talk. ""dickface!""  sunday morning, the girls headed to the house to do some more cleaning, and planned our girls night in. last minute, headed to john burkes house to watch a movie, and came back in a mad search for alcamahol. when the search came up to empty, we resorted to barbs sisters guys, who then came back to the house with us, thus ending our girls night. drank way way way way too much, and that resulted in a bad night in more ways than one. barb and i went to clean up, once again, yesterday, although we instead sat around talking about things and it was good. when we heard voices, we freaked out and barb trampled me and it was funny. it worries me that i had more fun sitting sober with one person than i did ""partying it up"" like us teenagers are supposed to do. i guess thats just because barb is the greatest and i dont know what i would do without her. i miss katie. 
and as of now, i think i may have just lost some friends that obviously cared about me alot less than i cared about him. its very frustrating, feeling this lost.
and now more about live journals! sorry about the length of this post ( i really dont know who im apoligizing too) but im wayy bored.  im not sure how much i like the whole livejournal community as a whole anymore. i made this livejournal for one person, and one person only, and thats myself. basically, my friends and i like the idea of keeping a record of what we did over summer so we can look back at the end and see what we hope was a really good time. but it hasnt really been taken that way. first of all, theres so many pressures. its like people feel the need to be clever and witty and funny for the enjoyment of the readers. it makes me not want to write. i just want to write my thoughts as they come, without having to pretend im writing some english essay with amazing grammar and clever phrases. and although many of you will say thats okay, you all very well know thats the case. and secondly, ""anonymous"" shit talkers confuse the hell out of me. the fact that it could possibly phase someone else to read about my life, especially if they dont like me , and then write to me about it, i will never get over. but i guess i just dont understand people. or maybe i understand them too well. the end, finally."

"event","Im tired and sore and all I want is advil and sleep but its all okay because last night was waaay fun. so, although ms. houston is gone, and we miss her, we are partying it up in her honor.  if i had enough energy to write all the funny things down so i could remember them when I come back and read this livejournal at the end of summer, I would. but im definetly too lazy. but how could i forget~ craziest thing eveeerrrrr~ 
tommy, in an attempt to busy the one and only kieran, told him they were in the land of zelda (Iapolgize if this is a little off, but it was wayconfusing)and keiran had to go on a mission to find the four green stones, because they will lead him to the gateway of time. of course, kieran intently embarked on his mission. taking a small break, he stopped to have a little session with brian wiser nora and i, and during this little session, he freaks out, picks up a circular green clock, and screams that he found the green stone that led to the gateway of time. yaaa it was way trippy. so we all run downstairs to tell tommy, and he laughs and goes ""okay so you got the green stone, but i asked for three other stones"" and kieran looks at me and nora standing on either side of him ad goes ""but TOMMY the three of us ARE STONED!"" funniest moment of my life.
then when everyone passed out, barb nora tommy jesse kieran and i had quite the adventure to the three springs park, then some crazzzzyyyyy hike up in the hills. and jesse trying to freak us out by saying there was murderers. and then i woke up real early after two hours of sleep and had to go to 5 hours of work. yyyaaaaaaaaaa"

"event","So i decided to stay in tonight, and I like it.  I helped my dad on the barbeque and made a pretty damn good dinner.  Then my dad and I went to this great little funky Cd store on Ventura where they sell CD's for crazy cheap.  If I would have spent anymore than 20 minutes in there, I would have ended up with too many CDs to carry out of there. So heres what I got, just for the hell of it:
Led Zeppelin~ Houses of the Holy
Jack Johnson~ On and On
Red Hot Chilli Peppers~ By the Way
AFI~ Sing the Sorrow
Styx/REO Speedwagon~ Arch Allies Live
G. Love and Special Sauce~ Best Of
Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals~ Burn to Shine

"event","Sooooooo we just got four FREE Ben Harper/Jack JOhnson tickets for Santa Barbara FROM BEN HARPER. Ya, thats right folks, we got tickets to the ben harper concert from the man himself.  Maannnnnn I love having a dad with a guitar store.  
In other news, no ones posted in a while, so Ill do a quick overview.  Katie, Barb and I recently got back from a quick trip to Santa Barbara/San Luis Obispo.  Absolutely Beautiful.  I am in loveeeeee with UCSB and I would die if I got in there. I wasnt as impressed with Cal Poly as I expected, a little too Louisville in college form (no skateboarding?). But it was soooooo much fun.  We stayed in a grogeous hotel right next to the beach. Katie and Barb~ I love you RIDICULOUSLY and i dont know what i would do without you both.  Getting walked in on! Jack JOhnson songs OVER AND OVER. tea party in the pool. whos the confuser? whos the confusee? barb throwing trash at the trash can on the OTHER side of the window.  walking down the stairs funny. why are you walking so weird? so then, each avacado would be $2.33, right? aaaaaa good times.
And Saturday, Nora had her final party. And what a good one it was. Nora~ my unending thanks for being such a trooper while people messed up your house and, uh, filled your spa up with bubbles.  Got to know my main man Katelco a little better, what a greeatt guy. Burrito fell in the spa and I really dont think I have ever laughed that hard in my life. Travis'Mr. King Impression. KYLE singing we are the world, complete with flying lighter. Dustin making steaks! And of course, adventures in noras park backyard. Just too many funny moments!
Beautiful Beach Day on Sunday, and a very sad goodbye to ms. Houston last night.  She left for France Today, and I will not be seeing my love for two weeks!  Had a nice dinner at our restaurant, somethings fishy on PCH, and then met up with the boys to say goodbye. Nick Santoro~ you are the FUNNIEST guy ive ever met in my life. Kakatie youre so sexy kakatie youre so sexy.  phillip, mandy, tonya and friends came out to play FO SHO. this post is dedicated to katie houston  because i will miss her sooo soooooo much.
Lastly, I strongly recommend you listen to It's all Understood by Jack JOhnson.  Even if youre not a big Jack fan, the lyrics are incredible and it kills me everyime. and too audrey~ my baby, i love you soooo much and i appreciate our friendsip more than anything and i always want you to be my friend forever and dont ever think any different. aloha, kristine.

"event","I have decided I am sick of my ignorance.  And I am well aware of it.  Actually, not sick of it, but more disspointed.  We all live in CAlifornia, teenagers, having a good time, living the life.  I have no problem with that, but I have decided I want to see everything else.  Get out of my bubble.  Because living here and doing all the things we do just make us normal, and I think we deserve more than that.  NO white picket fence house, or atleast not until Ive seen the other side. THis is not at all meant to be pessimistic, just thoughts that sprang from a weird movie i just watched.

And secondly, I really can't get over the whole live journal phenomenon.  It's kind of hilarious.  I've found ourselves saying things like ""we have to write about that on our livejournal!"" or ""ya they hooked up, I read it on his livejournal."" its like our own little community.  we are the ""people that have livejournals.""  Theres the smart people, and the funny people, and the people who dont care, and the people who care to much, and the skanks, and the anonymous shit talkers.  theres an understanding between us livejournal users.  matt lebrun called barb normalami. its kinda like a cult.  maybe our name should be ""randomthoughts.""  might be a little more fitting. peace out homes ~kristine"

Before that we had yet ANOTHER awesome day at the beach. theres always so many people there. audrey and katie~ water times equals bonding times. haah we are hardcore! then after going to ""class"" we hit up some kickback to say hola to barbs sisters friends. who are really cool and are going to come see led zepagain with us on saturday. then off to the grassini household. funny people doing funny things. up to the loft with brian reagan and troy for some good ol fun. molly has a horse and its really cool. katie natalie and i missed curfew because we were sitting in the el camino shopping center talking to two scary persians who live in san francisco and wear deisel clothes and i think they are gay but they still almost raped us. but katies too nice! then times with the burrito man! firetrucks coming in at 3 in the morning. we had the amazing privelege to sleep in the freezing car. and go back at katies at 7 with the plan to wake up again at 7 30 to leave for summer school, only to forget to set the alarm and not wake up till 10. oo man we are stupid. but its all good in hood ladies. and theory to think about: people are crazy. if you ever get the chance, i really recommend people watching. especially at parties. its very entertaining, life seems so trivial when you watch someone elses. and thats about it~ see ya on the flip side. ~duehren"

(i love you guys!) kristine and i doing the mirror but not knowing who is the real person, someone stepping in dog shit and making the whole house smell, gravity bong in the living room (invasion style), interesting hookups in el bano, hotel california moments, strange accents ""do vant some veed?"", and as always dancing in the moonlight finds its way into the CD player (no complaints!) Later last night me, barb, kristine, and CC went to another party with meghan back in the WLV. meghan, we were trying so hard not to embarass you, but i have a feeling it didn't work. So this guy packs a brick for us and we all hit it - most amazing materials ever! Then he milks it for CC (who has only made a house once in her life) and she clears it like a champ. But PROBLEM! She trips out! I mean trips out! I've never seen anyone like that in my life! I'll just put it this way, the only two things she said all night were ""When will this be over?"" and ""Do I need to go to the hospital?"" as her whole body is convulsing. Oh man it was funny! I'm sorry CC...never again I promise! So then we go to burger king and guess who we see. All the STONERS at 3:00 am getting their munchies! YEA! 
This morning I went to work wayyy hungover as usual. Then took a 5 hour nap...I don't know if that is even considered a nap. Oh well! Summer school tomorrow = gay! Love you guys! ""DONT COME AROUND""

"event","alright so yesterday i cleaned at the barn and rode. my mom watched me ride TJ. i cleaned and shit then katie and katie show up. pat told me that katie was gonna ride spirit but i knew that wasn't gonna happen. so little katie ride him for 15 mins but she was tired so pat told me to get on him. i had to have been on for at least a hour. my legs and shoulders are killing me and i have blisters in between my fingers from trying to hold him back. 

after that i went home and took a shower. then i went to chels. we talked a lot and shit. it was nice. i haven't seen her in so long. i miss hanging out with her. i slept over there. we went to bed at around 3 and didn't wake up until 1:30. it felt good to sleep late because i didn't have work. i went home at around 3 and got ready to go to the car show with my dad.

my dad picked me and my brother up at 5. we stopped and got pizza then picked up sal and dan. we dropped dan off at his moms then headed to the car show. omfg! it was awesome. i was in heaven. these cars were beautiful!! there were a lot of nice trucks  that i would but in a second. we walked around for a few hours and as we walked down the last row of cars i saw this civic for sale. it was only $6000! it was beautiful. it was a '97 V-Tech with a carbon hood. omg i was in love. if i had 6000$ i would have bought it. it was hot. i cant wait until i have enough money to buy a car. i think im going to go to the car shows to look for a car next summer instead of going to a dealer. should be fun. only 5 months and 29 days until i can get my juniors!!

that is the end of my fun for the week. now i have to work wed-sun. :(

"event","well i decided to make a new journal..not that anyone will read it. all summer ive worked and earned over $1000 so woo for me. hopefully i will be able to buy a car by next summer. i should get my raise next week so that will be good. more money to spend.

2 weeks ago i went to Virginia to visit my aunt. we drove around looking at houses. it really made me think about moving down there now instead of after i graduate because everything just seems easier down there. its cheaper and i can afford the horse i always wanted. my uncle got offered a job there so when they go to take my cousin to school they are gonna look at houses. when they get back they are putting their house up for sale. my cousins kenny and krissi might move in with my grandma if they dont move with their parents. so there goes all the family i have. i dont have a reason to stay up here anymore. i dont have chris or my friends. this summer everything changed. i dont know why but it just did. nothing is the same.

school starts in a week and a half. that should be interesting. hopefully it will be a good year."

I proved to myself and to some others that I can totally achieve my goal, it's going to be much easier that I thought. And everything really does happen for a reason. I got my lips injected with retaline today... they are starting to look normal (aside from swelling) yay. (yes I know blah blah blah blah blah who cares about looks and lips... YOU DO!!!) hmm nothing else really happened... this week is going to go by so slowly I can;t wait for IU!"

"event","After cheesecake factory last night I started to get sad. I have hated being here for as long as I can remember, but now that I'm almost gone, part of me doesn't want to leave. I am going to miss so many people I barely ever think about.What's even weirder is the people I know I should miss, but probably won't. I honestly can't believe it's practically over... the end of an era. For some people, it already is over.  Everyone is being so nice this week- so emotional, if I were the type of person who cried, I'd be bawling by now. Hillary is leaving tomorrow!!! I am so excited for her, but going to miss her so much. This summer we became such close friends, it's going to be weird not to have her around. And speaking of which, where did the summer go? This was the longest summer I've ever had, and it started out so slowly, how did it all just fly by so quickly? sigh. 
Another thing that makes me feel bad is the one friend I realized I probably won't miss at all, though she should be the one I miss the most. Maybe our friendship was never real. This is why I don't believe in best friends. 
I bought a ton of new clothes today...and shoes, and pj's, I am all set. I got my cartilage pierced for the 3rd time (this time my mom was with me and allowed it). As sad as I am, I am ready to leave. this is going to be a very long week. 

** another thing- to all of you who claim I complain too much, here's something to ponder: have you ever heard me complain about my hair (or the lack there of)? NO! so yea, maybe I do complain a lot, but sometimes I have a lot to complain about, and I definitely don't complain about everything. I bet you you couldn't handle being sorta bald for even a day, I know someone who freaked out about losing half an eyebrow. I draw my eyebrows on every day, yet I never complain about it.**"

I at least want to experience college, once I decide I hate that too- then I can die. But not today. In case however, I do not live past tomorrow's surgery, I want you to know that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being mean (but i must admit it was a little fun), I'm sorry for taking many of you for granted, and I'm sorry for everything and anything else I have done to you. Also I want to say thank you. Thank you to those people who called tonight to make sure that I will be ok tomorrow, thank you to my friends for being such great friends, I love you. and thank you Jason for always being very nice to me and inviting me tonight. I appreciate it all and I'm sorry for not always doing so. I love all of you, even those of you who I claim to hate, I don't really. That's all I have to say and I hope I can write another livejournal tomorrow night, where i will be really happy to be alive, goodnight."

You obviously don't understand, nor want to understand the postion I am coming from. I understand that for many people they don't have to go through shit and so wisdom teeth is a huge deal because it's the first and only. Well I'm sorry but that does bother me, I'm not saying it's your fault, I'm just saying that from my perspective, it is bothersome. It's hard to watch people look perfect and normal and then freak out at something that in my eyes is minor. I know I could have way worse things happen to me, but it's very hard for me. I also get very upset before I have to go through this stuff so I'm not in a good mood this week. This is a HARD week for me. Next week will be hard too. and it really makes me mad that people can't understand this."

"event","you can't all sit around ignoring me for most of a summer, ignore my calls, talk shit about me and pretend I don't even matter until g-d forbid I state my opinion about wisdom teeth, and then you get all mad at me. ha no, I don't think so. I'm not usually a mean person therefore I don't tend to be outright obnoxious when something pisses me off. I wait for the moment, cause I know how to be a bitch too, ya know. And I  never said my problems were the worst, but in this circle scheme of surgical procedures this week- they are. I don't think wisdom teeth aren't painful...I just think people make a huge deal out of it because they've never had to go through anything else that requires physical pain. Plus the fact that I know that when people they their wisdom teeth out, the world folds for them, everyone visits, everyone treats it like they jsut had open heart surgery. Me, people don;t visit or care, and it's because they assume I just do it so many times that it's not big deal. well newsflash: it's ALWAYS a big deal, and it's always going to hurt me, and it emotionally scars me even more- obviously or I wouldn't be flipping out about wisdom teeth- so maybe you all need to start thinking before you jump down my throat. Maybe you should pay attention to me, positive attention, and maybe, if you think that wisdom teeth are so painful to get out- then you should be NICE to a person who has to hae a little more than that done, a LOT more times. oh yea... and wisdom teeth leave people looking chipmonkish, so they don't need to leave their house, out of embarassment, well uh... let me remind you, I had to walk around with a deformed face for 15 years. so please walk outside, go to the mall, get stared at for the week when you people are deformed, and then come back and tell me how it feels."

"event","I realized that it's really hard to be yourself when the people you are surrounded by don't allow it. I get weird vibes from some people, and there are so many people who just don't care to know me. I've acted like a complete idiot in the past...I know...but now it's so hard to change that in certain settings. I know I have it in me and that I have the skills, I just can't seem to bring them out when everyone who excpects to me act 1 way is there. It's easier to just go along with their judgements then try to overcome it. I know that's wrong, but that's how I feel, and I feel that eve if I did shine my true personality, nobody would take me seriously. 

Next, Billy's dad. I can't believe it. It's weird, this is not even someone I know, yes I've seen him around, at football games, in his driveway, at the park, but I never actually met the man, and still I am incredibly sad. Billy was never my friend, I don't think we've ever said anything nice to each other. But I feel so bad and want to be there for him. I spent such a long time feeling bad for him, and praying for him, and so many times I wanted to walk up to him and tell him that I hoped everything was going okay and that my love and wishes were there. I really cared- which is strange. Now though it's even more odd, I always wondered what would happen on the awful day when he did pass away. (seriously- I thought about this man and family a ton) Would I go to shiva? send a card? give hugs? I wanted so badly to be there for Billy, ever since the first time I heard about his dad being sick. Now, I don't know what to do. I feel so bad, words cannot even express. I think I'll send a card, even though that seems to small and unimportant. I can't even imagine what he is going through right now. I keep thinkig about the man who died too, about how strong he was, how hard that must have been. His suffering is over, but he was so admirable. His poor wife, and daughters too- I don't know how they can manage.I don't know what I'm trying to say...just random thoughts I guess. But I am sad, very sad, and I don't even know how to react."

Tonight I got a very untrue story from someone, that lead me to believe I was hated, unwanted and annoying. That and the fact that my best friend of the summer, well my second best friend of the summer, got mad at me for no reason- litterally- and then unmad at me 24 hours later, when I asked why, the answer was ""I don't know, there wasn't really a reason I just was."" weird. But the dramatic thing, I don't see the point in causing problems in EVERYTHING. and this person needs a chill pill she freaks out about absolutely everything, all the time. I can't stand it. 

Other than that, life has been extremely good lately. On my boy list, Boy A is uh...outt the picture (read contract 2 entries below), Boy B - we'll see, Boy G is moving along quite nicely, he likes me- yay- and umm yeah...stuff's been good there, and the rest whatever. I have another boy too well possibly, I met him for like 20 min at some random person's hot tub, but he liked me...so we shall see what happens there. I'm not used to being acceptable. I used to be ugly and gross and now I'm like not. Well I stil think I am, but my love life has gotten WAY easier. anyways I'm packing and going to Boston then Maine (the plain) for the next 4 or 5 days.

Maybe I'll forever be your pup
I'll take my chances
and forgive you for those dances,
cause I have liked you for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know how perfect that you are
You're wonderful so far
even if it's not towards me

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you already know that
I have liked you for

Guy B: Saw him the other day for the first time in a while. We talked, caught up. I don't know how I feel about him, I think the ""sparks"" could be gone. sad. But we definitely need more time to tell so for now this is still a question mark. 
Guy C: Thing is over, I heard he has STDs, and I just don't like him anymore. 
Guy D: no change since last post
Guy E: we hung out again 2 nights ago and had a really good time. He wants to hang out more this weekend, we have definite plans for sunday and I'm starting to think he wants me. I don't know if I want him or not though, part of me does and part of me doesn't. This is way too hard!!!
Guy F: no change here.
Guy G: saw him today. He told me he's annoyed with jackie, which led into a screaming fight between the 2 of them, ok mostly her screaming at him as he walked away laughing and not caring. so sad for the stalkee. Anyways He was nice to me and got over the whole ""owning me"" thing.

Me, Jackie, Corrie (cousin), and Mor (Jackie's friend) got to the concert at 7:25 pm. We then went to the stage building and asked for ""shelly"", we were checked off on the lisand led into the ""secret"" office, where we waiting for about 10 minutes. Finally, Shelly came and took us to meet the BEACH BOYS!!! I was ecstatic!!!So we walked up and some other people, 1 who I knew, were taking pictures with MIKE LOVE and BRUCE JOHNSTON. I stared in complete bliss. MIKE LOVE then turned his head and winked at us. (we were the only group of young bodacious babes there) After they were done signing Mike came over and said hi to Jackie,and the me. He looked at me and said ""you look great"" almost as if he knew I had surgery or something. It was weird. I thanked him...though was very confused. Then Bruce came over and asked us our names and ages. Corrie and I told him we just graduated so he lectured us about college and grad school etc. Mike was WAY more fun. He started talking to me- saying Indiana is a great party school, he signed my pink post-it notes, and then we took lots of pictures. We talked more...I don't know what about but it was fun!!! I told him I loved him (hahahaha) and I'd been a super fan since second grade. (he laughed)He put his arm around me a lot, and bascially...flirted. Corrie, Jackie and Mor were lauhging hysterically at our quick little ""bond"". He then asked us if we wanted anything to eat and took us into a room filled with food. We continued to chat and then he was called into the dressing room. J,C,M and I screeched and screamed and couldn't believe our luck. They all laughed about how he was hitting on me and how I was on my way to stardom. We figured we should get going since the show was starting, so we headed over to Bruce to say goodbye...more college lectures (weirdo?) and then back out to the hall. We asked the guard where Mike was so we could say goodbye, but were told he was gone. So we walked down the hall and headed to our seats... just then ""LIZZZZZIEEEEEEEEEE LIZZIEEEEE"" we turn around and who is calling MY name??? MIKE LOVE!!!!!!!!!! running down the hall. ""Lizzie, aren't you going to say goodbye to me? we're friends now!"" he said. MIKE LOVE SAID THIS TO ME!!!! AAAAAAH!!! I swear I almost fainted. I told him they said he left! He made some joke and then we talked more, corrie whipped our the camera again, and jackie had him sign her pillow case for the 3rd time. Mike then looked at my backstage pass and asked if I was going to need it ""no? why?"" ""what's your cell number?"" ""seriously?"" ""yeah how else am I gonna find you when I go to Bloomington?"" this caused tons of laughter- but I wrote my cell number on the card (corrie took a picture of this of course) and then gave it to mike, who stuck it to his shirt. We then said our goodbyes, and Mike gave me 1 last hug (no one else got hugs) and said he'd call me. J,C,M anbd I cracked up as we got to walk across the beach boy's stage and down to our seats. BUT WAIT... it doesn't end there... then throughout the show Mike waved at me and blew kisses at me or as corrie says had ""singer sex"" with me (like cheer sex from bring it on). I waved back and laughed... a lot. It was by far the funniest thing that has ever happened to me. Jackie thinks he is going to call me, I think he through the number away 5 seconds later. but dude MIKE LOVE KNOWS MY NAME!!!!! MIKE LOVE HAD MY NUMBER!!!!! AND MIKE LOVE HUGGED ME, YES ME!!!!!!!! so Maybe I'm not too skinny, or too ugly...and if all else fails I can always have my rockstar bud! 
or maybe he just thought I was ugly and felt bad for me...then again I did look like a total babe.  I HOPE I MEET BILLY JOEL...THEN MY LIFE WILL BE COMPLETE!"

Guy A: techinically doesn't belong on this list or need any form of an intorduction. He is hardly available (to me), and sits on his nice little pedestal all day with  glow about him that matches his hair. He is perfect, you know, and sets a very unfair precedent for all the rest of the guys on this list. need I say more?
But let us go down to the mortal level where I give you,
Guy B: I don't really know what our relationship will be as of the present time. However in a few short hours I will be able to figure this one out. Based on past experience, there is some ""sexual tension"" and most who know us see potential. I have been very immature in the past so I'm thinking this could be it...but then again, once I get over this challange there will be no need for him either. 
Guy C: he's hot. he's nice. we sort of have a ""thing"" going on. I really liked him at first, but now am getting sick of him. I have issues. 
Guy D: the ex-boyfriend who has now deemed me as ""hot"". He's cool to hang out with, I suppose, but it's a been there done that sort of thing. but then again it is quite the ego booster.
Guy E: nice, older, cute, just met, there's possibility there...but again once I got his signals of liking me, I have lost my interest in him. 
Guy F: nice guy- cute, charming, the whole shpiel. friendly getting friendlier, yet still there is something about him that just isn't right.
Guy G: he also doesn't quite belong on this list, but old crushes die hard. He is not so much a love interest anymore but just a friendship one. We are friends, we've been friends since before birth (we don't have much choice)but he has his pedophialiac thing going on, and even if I could have him, I'm not sure I'd want him as more than a close friend. Oh yea and he's annoying and thinks he owns me.

Basically from this lovely list, all I realize is that guy A fucks every thing. (except me). If only I didn't have his sheer charm and perfection hanging over my head..then MAYBE, just MAYBE I could act normal and settle into something that could be good for me. I guess the only thing to do is take a trip on over to p to the n, smile my beautiful teeth smile, and flirt with a confidence I have never had before in his allmighty presence. Once I get him...I can get on with life, and experience all the other wonderful boys there are out there!!! WISH ME LUCK AND IF YOU KNOW ANY LOVE SPELLS...SEND THEM MY WAY! thanks!"

They aren't perfect or even close but dude they are real!!!!!!!  and they do look nice. woah conceitedness. Yesterday I went to green acres to do some major undoing of whatever jackie did. I realized that I too have the power of hotness...actually this guy told me I was hot a bought me a bottle of tequila (my fav.) so I figured- what the hell. Continuing on...I went to the tennis shop dressed to impress (tennis skanky) and did my absolute best job of acting like a super-confident-had-teeth-all-her-life-flirt and it worked. First I got the number of a 22 yr old (who I then hung out with last night). Then still on my powertrip of not thinking I am a hiddeous beast, I went over to the driving range (dun dun dun dunnnnnnn) to correct a false image of myself by a very ANNOYING family friend who THINKS that his 2 and a half year age superior to myself makes him the know it all of my life. So, I sucked up big time, and smiled a ton. I hope he got the picture. (for more details on this subject just ask me I can't write anymore of this)...yea then I was passing through the ladies locker room and I got attacked by all these grandmas commenting on my perfect figure saying I have Cher's body (minus the plastic surgery and bulemia). I saw Akat's grandma who said I need to meet him. good. I want to! then......... tennis boy called and I went to umphrey's with melissa...I took my little tushy ALL THE WAY DOWN TOWN to see a great band and HWSRN but guess what...HWSRN wasn't there!!!!!!!!!! the whole ding-danged fro crew was...plus a few extras but noooooooo HWSRN. I did see him driving the day before, he is sooooo sexy when he wears glasses*, aaaaaaaaaaah!!! After the show we went to tennis boy's house and then to michelle's. they smoked, I did not. and Tennis boy is really cool, nice, hot, ya know. I'm waiting for my other tennis boy to come back (tomorrow!!) we talked online. I will always love him, and this summer it's def. going to happen. yay. so life is good and I'm not ugly. for now.

*my HWSRN fantasy is him wearing his glasses, no hat, slightly messed up hair, no shirt, and red joe boxer flannel pants. (i should buy him a pair for his bday so he can be 100% ready when I rape him hehehe jk)"

"event","I haven't written in a while...a while for me anyway. I went to New York and met the imfamous Raquel. I can't wait for next year! We had so much fun and got along sooooooooo well. I was invited back for her graduation party 4th og july weekend but I can't go. A really funny thing happened while I was there... after our very very long tiring day of shopping in soho (I got a fake ID!!!), we made our way back to the subway. The ride to the hotel was 15 minutes and included a train switch. well... it was very crowded and Raq got on and as I was getting on the door started to close on me so I jumped back thinking it was like an elevator and the door would open...not so! The door closed and Raq was in the train and I was not. First off we started laughing our tuchases off...but then the train started to move and we realized 'UH OH' so she motioned of me to get on the next train and call her. I was still laughing and got on the next train about 5 minutes later. Once I got on I was a bit confused as to where I was going and there was no reception to call raq. the woman/girl next to me was really nice and helped me figure it out. Then we talked for a while. her name ws Jameesa she's from tennessee originally then moved to michigan and now new york. she works in education something I forgot though. Finally I got off the train and Grand Central Station and took my phone got service! thank g-d! Raq called me and told me she was already at our final stop because she couldn't wait for the trains, but to get on the shuttle and call her when I came out. She was of course freaked out - and releived that I thought it was still laughing and ok. After the shuttle ride I got upstairs and outside, I called Raq frantically because now I was officially lost in new york city- some guy- late 20s early 30s came up to me rubbed against me and said ""you're all alone?"" in a weird trying to be sexual voice I got soooo scared said ""uh im waiting for a friend"" and ran! Then Raq and I found each other with the help of cell phones and the lion king sign, and everything was okay. Now we have an official first bonding experience and something to laugh about for the next 4 years.  thew rest of the trip went well- her parents are nice, my mom got along with them (my dad stayed home),and I think this is going to work out well. 

Next- I FINALLY after 18 years, 5 months 3 weeks and 2 days of livng, I got teeth. Permanent, white, overlapping teeth. NORMAL TEETH! my mouth is complete- no retainers no nothing that comes out. It's 100% attatched to my mouth. My top teeth are longer than the bottoms, I no longer have a weird bite- and my mouth looks sooooooooooooo normal I can barely believe it's my mouth. and you can even see my top teeth when I talk!!! NORMAL!!! the dental hygenist said to me when I was ""under the explorer"" (in the chair being worked on) ""good things come to those who wait"" meaning my nice teeth. and I agreed but then I was like wait a second...EVERYONE ELSE IS BORN WITH TEETH! well nto born with but they come in normal. and they don't have a total of like 6 until they are legal adult for almost half a year. well whatever now I have them, now I look normal...and maybe 23yr old guys will stop hitting on my sister and start hitting on me. I'M STILL WAY WAY WAY WAY FUCKIN' SKINNIER!!!!!! WITH WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY BIGGER BOOBS!!!!!! AND HELLO- I'M THE LEGAL ONE! why is it sooooooooooooo necessary to be pretty around here???"

in other news I saw HWSRN today. He's gotta stop working those random hours when I'm expecting NOT to see him. or I need to stop going there. whatever. It was weird. 1st of all...he just didn't have that whole aura glow thing. No pedestal with the halo and the light coming from behind him. He was just soooooooooo human. ick. second, it was weird and too...normal of an interaction. I also think we were telepathic at some point...which is always a weird feeling. we talked a little...stupid small talk stuff. and I got the big bonaroo answer- NO HE DIDN'T GO! (hey since so many people asked me, I figured I may as well know the answer) I think our entire relationship is way too weird and fucked up and as much as my heart has moved on, my head doesn't want it that way. I like liking him. I like the idea of being obsessed with him. It's my identity. which is sad. I guess I just don't want to get over him ever. but technically, I have! aaaah!

"event","I went through some old journals tonight, ya know from back in the day when I actually wrote with a pen. I had a very boring life...I still probably do, but at least my livejournals are somewhatever entertaining. (to me they are!!!) I was very naive, and just...immature. Maybe I'll look back at this and think I was immature now too...but even my writing style has improved. Enough about the technicalities, the thing I was most shocked by was that the object of my obsession throughout the entire journal was not HWSRN. Of course he had a few honorable mention, but my ""main squeeze"" was someone else. I never fully admitted to liking this boy either, I even denied it in the journal. But wow I was obsessed. I taped in e-mails, aol convos, and wrote pages and pages analyzing our relationship. (we actually were good friends). I haven't seen him recently (college, studying abroad, summer school) the last time we had plans it felt weird and I had no feelings for him at all. I guess I'm excited to see him this summer...but I have a feeling that things will be really different from the past 3. I hope I'm more mature...I will definitely be more calm...and I don't know, it's just going to be very very weird. I feel like if it is meant to be, this is the time it will be, and if not, then it won't. The funny thing is I don't really care either way.  and Oh yea I came across a memory of ""smoothie time"" with him...I don't know what it is with me being obsessed with boys who are somehow related to smoothies!!!"

What is it with me...is there a reason for this insanity? 

also...like 4 people have come up to me this week asking if HWSRN is at bonaroo or not. And I'm like ""how should I know!"" seriously people I'm not his keeper. In fact I'm not even his stalker anymore. I got bored of stalking him, plus he enjoys it too much. stalking someone who wants to be stalked takes the fun out of it. so yea don't ask me about him or his whereabouts because I don't know and I don't care."

Not saying I don't do that occasionally too...but then I don't go say how much I love them. usually if I hate someone I make it well known. Speaking of which- I do hate you, and you think I love you, it's quite humorous. get a life. yea anyways.....
there have been a few really great people around here. I love them and thanks because you've made me feel way better. 2 bitchy girls aren't worth all this...especially cause I'm skinnier. (by the way I don't really think that way I'm just trying to be obnoxious)

I hate myself for talking too much, i ramble stupid things. and half the time they come out totally wrong and it hurts someone's feelings indirectly. I need to start thinking before I speak. Once back in the day a not so smart boy (who shall remain nameless) told me that I shouldn't think before I speak, it should just come out. I don't know why I took thois advice...I was too busy idolizing. But even so it's not his fault that I say dumb things, it's my own. I am going to work on that.

I feel bad about the fact that I'm not going to miss anyone next year. I can't wait to get the fuck outta this shithole of a place. I keep reminding myself of vacations and other such get-aways where people really like me. maybe when my repuation doesn't precede me, I'm an ok person. Wow- what a novel idea? 

I hate how people keep telling me to ""just get self confidence"". it doesn't exactly come in a bottle, ya know! and for all of your information I had some, a lot, a long time ago. I was way charming.  but years of verbal abuse and being ugly and going through shit sucked it right out of me. Positive reinforcment about myself once in a while might boost my confidence. Inviting me out once in a while, calling me, asking how my latest surgery or procedure was (I was in the hospital under anestheisa today, did you know that?), compliment something- anything about me! (I have a near-perfect figure, that's a start!) yea so basically, confidence is something that ""normal"" people get because they are treated normally. I wasn't, and still am not.

"event","I am the sneaking out challenged. I don't know why, but in each of my 3 attempts (plus florida and arizona which don't count) I have either been caught, or almost killed in a snowstorm. Yet somehow my sister manages to do this multiple times a week???

Experience 1: October 13, 2001 (12:30 pm)- HWSRN and I were somewhat friends.He had just gotten back from the Black Crowe's concert, I had just gotten back from seeing some random band at the metro. Our aol conversation then turned to phone. HWSRN then said ""hey what are you doing right now?"" ""talking to you"" was my extremely happy reply. ""You wanna maybe come over and talk to me, in person?"" HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUUUUUUAAAAAAAAH! ( i swear to g-d I heard that playing somewhere) ""umm now?"" ""yea...I'd go to you but I don't drive"" (he didn't get his licence til like march that year)""ok...my mom is sleeping so I guess I can get out if I'm quiet"" ""ok cool- give me a call when you are on your way"" ""how do I get there?"" (if that wasn't the lie of the century I don't know what was!) He gave me directions, and his cell number. I gave him mine, just in case. I made it all the way to my car, to my street when I heard ""LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIZZZZZZZ"" and looked to see my mother chasing behind me. HWSRN called just at that moment, I stopped the car and answered the phone. ""You're still coming right?"" ""umm... hold on..."" my mother then asked me where I was going, ""HWSRN's house!"" I said as sweetly as possible. ""OH no you're not!!!"" so then, very very very very very very....sadly I told my crush to end all crushes,that I could not go to his house. ""Maybe some other time"" he said, and told me to give him a call. SOME OTHER TIME NEVER FUCKING HAPPENED AND NOW HE ""HATES"" ME!!!!!!!!!! well...at least we have college.

Experience 2: November someting, 2002 (2ish am)- Many of you know this story as it was a livejournal back when it happened. I'm talking online to someone who I shall call ""aaron"". ""Aaron"" said he was bored, horny and thought I was hot. I had mono but was bored and figured, how many guys think I'm hot, and when was the last time I got out. I didn't get caught leaving, Nobody heard me pull out of the driveway- everything was going smooth. I got to his house, a whole 15 minutes later, went in the back door and proceeded to the basement. Around 4 I got paranoid and decided to leave. Much to my dismay I discoerved that it had snowed- mucho, mondo, major snowed in those  2 hours. My car and snow don't do well. None of the streets were plowed. I skidded, slipped, and slid, all the way home. It took me 45 minutes. I didn't stop at many stop signs considering I couldn't, and did quite a few 360s. I honestly thought I was going to die. Finally when I did get home, I tried to pull into the uphill driveway (at the old house now dean's house) I went sliding back into the street. I was terrified. I saw dean's light on next door and almost called him for help. Luckily though on my third try I got enough of the way up into the driveway to stay there, I ran into the house and vowed never to sneak out again. 

Experience 3: Tonight, 2 am.- I was talking to my ""Marcus Flutie"" online as I have been recently. I decided that after 2 weeks of debating whether or not to meet up with him in the middle of the night or not that tonight would be the night. I think he's hot, he has charisma, and he's connected to the FC. I got dressed in my black thong, no bra, tight dance pants, and michigan state sweatshirt (It's cold). I was ready to rock and roll. So lalala I tiptoed down the stairs completely silently, got to the front door safely (the lights were off) I unlocked the lock in perfect silence, turned the knob when ""BEEP BEEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP....YOUR ALARM SYSTEM IS ACTIVATED"" who knew we had a TALKING alarm? who knew we had an alarm at all!!!!! how the hell does jackie do it??? After the alarm, the dogs started to bark like crazy, the cat meowed (she thinks she's a dog) and my parents woke up. I told them I was getting lemonade from the garage so they said it was ok. I waited 10 more min, listened for their snores and headed to my car. Unfortunately just as I headed out the door for the second time, ""MF"" called my cell. I managed to turn it off, I got in the car and despite my lightless and quiet attempt at turning it on- my parents re-awoke and called my cell phone. I told them I was just getting a cd. They believed me. I called ""MF"" back and told him no-go. He's mad at me now. Whatever, it's not my fault. 

In conclusion all evidence points in 1 direction- I am utterly incapable of sneaking out, and I am eternally destined to be a goody-goody."

SOmething I've noticed recently. when guys think you have a hot body and don't want to come right out and say it they just say ""you are very fit"" or ""do you workout"" and then when I respond ""thanks but no i don't workout- ever"" they say ""oh so how do you get such a great body? i mean stay in shape!"" funny.

"event","School is 100% officially over- yay...right? It's weird, I thought I'd be incredibly happy but last night I realized for the first time ever, that I may actually miss some of these people. (*even the ones I thought I hated). Take the FC for example...they totally suck- super duper mondo suck, but next year when it's just me and HWSRN, I'll miss the rest of them in a very messed up twisted sort of way. I like our class as a whole- when the groups and grudges get taken away. Unfortunately, I couldn't make amends with all the people I wanted to. I figured it was pointless, I think I've caused to much damage to even try to repair it. I watched one of my good friends do exactly what I wanted to- but I'm happy for her that she could. (even if I was abandonded for every cute guy she's wanted but never actually done anything about over the past 4 years...or longer) well anyways, I thought about doing that, ""coming out of my shell"" and being all happy and cute and flirty, but I am the stalker (like I am the walrus) and stalker's can't just do that!!! I need the next 2 months and 28 days to recover and shed my stalking skin. Then I can be whoever the hell I want whenever the hell I want and nobody will care. I made a sorta new friend last night...he is also going to Indiana. He's connected with he FC so I didn't expect him to speak to me, but he was like incredibly nice. We had a good 15 minute convo about next year and stuff...which is long for someone who is such good friends with HWSRN. not to mention that HWSRN was standing a whole 10 feet behind us watching this convo with a very confused look on his face. HA! I think next year will be awesome...I mean HWSRN is cool without the FC (I'll explain later) and his friends who are going said we'd hang out...and I will be meeting new people and I dunno it's all gonna be great I just wanna go already! 
I wish I could have done high school differently...not fucked up so much as a person. (I am sooooooooooooo socially in-ept). Not been so damn ugly- not been a stalker, learned to have friends, not been annoying and maybe done a tad more homework. But I guess it's over and I can't change the past I can only work on the future.  
Also- someone said something that really made me think last night. As my friend was reuniting with her past loves, and I was sanding there talking to them and IU boy (before our own convo) and the whole business card thing got brought up (IT WASN'T ME!!!) after my patner in crime admitted to solely being responsible, she talked about all the other things we found in her big box of saced stuff. The aol convo between her and mikey (hahahah i love how I call him that) saying ""I will make the rest of your days very difficult"" or whatever he said back in 8th grade, and her old love said ""ha like what could he do...laugh at you in the halls, who cares how is that making your life difficult"" and I was like woah dude!!!! Why didn't I think of that 59393929 years ago! Who cares if the FC laughs at me....they're fucking stupid assholes anyway, they didn't even dance at boat party they couldn't get off their lazy asses complaining about not being wasted. It was the original 6 plus 2 other stupid anti-sober people, and they looked ridiculous and missed out of fun! but yea who cares...I need to learn hot to not care- so I intend to have an amazing summer and make some friends!"

First off because I'm still mad about the ""she got a nosejob for me"" thing, which he will see tomorrow that my nose has not changed!!! and second cause dude, he looks way cuter in comfy clothes and wearing glasses! ok well that's enough im going to bed after my 5 hour phone convo til 4 am last night I need sleep"

"event","I've realized something these past 2 weeks. Not to take things for granted, I mean wow look at all the things we have that so many other people don't. The funnier thing is, when you don't have something, you sometimes don't even realize how great it is. I've been incredibly appreciative of my fingers, toes, eyes, ears, legs, and abilities today. Plus my surroundings, my home, my family (ok only some of them), and my friends. You are probably wondering what sparked this in the usually negative complaining person that I am. Well...today I got my very first permanent teeth on the bottom half of my mouth!!! Meaning, I am retainerless on the bottom, my teeth look nice, and most importantly I CAN EAT!!! I have never had a full mouth of teeth that I couldn't take out before- as of June 9 I will. (that's when I get the top ones). It's a great feeling. Yesterday at lunch my half of a tooth retainer fell out in my strawberry shortcake- talk about embarassing, today I can eat anything and these teeth will never come out!!! I am thrilled. It seems like such a small thing to make someone happy, since most people have had this since they were 3 or 4 years old (or whenver it is that you get teeth). But yea, it just made me realize that we should appreciate the stuff we do have, like our hands- cause somewhere out there someone is getting their very first hand today."

I might be going for the wrong reasons, to get dressed up, cause I have nothing else to do, and oh yea...it's a prime stalking opportunity. (jk!!!!)

"event","Tonight I found my Marcus Flutie. (now where's my scott glazer?) Seriously though, I found him a long time ago...he became a marcus flutie tonight. yay.

Speaking of Marcuses...I know one who may not have too much of a life ahead of him... KIDDING KIDDING but I am a bit peeved! So here is what I have to say: I had my rib removed and put in my nose for 1 and ONLY 1 reason! because I was born with a cleft lip and palate etc etc and my septum was like super duper deviated and my nose bone or cartilage or whatever is in there was not functioning properly. Therefore I needed surgery to rearrange my face and make me breathe so that I don't snore in college. Well, really just so I can breathe. Now...whether I atteneded deerfield high school, went on that chem-phys field trip on march 15, 2000- or not, I would have had this surgery at some point in my life...maybe even sooner if not for those occurences. The point is, in no way shape or form was this related to scott marcus. in fact it wasn't related to anyone EXCEPT ME!!!!!!!!!!! so scott..you can go have a nice long chat with g-d about why I was born that way and why I needed this surgery... and maybe then you will get it through your conceited little blonde head that YOU ARE NOT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND MY FACE IS MY FACE REGUARDLESS!!!!!!!!! (and i'm not even going to look much different!)
***also- many many many other cleft people have this surgery, one of my friends from minnesota who is 22 is having her bone graft nose cleft surgery in 2 weeks! and i assure you she's never met scott marcus!***"

"event","I;m alive. II think the past 2 days were hell,but as I was going through it, it really didn't seem bad. I woke up from anesthesia with an oxygen mask on me gasping for air and my heart racing, I thought I'd die. All I thought though as I struggles to breath was ""the worst is over, I'm ok...I can do this, this is just a short moment in my life soon to be over"" and it helped me soooooooooooooo much. I started talking to the nurses, and slowed my heart rate. i thought of other things, and I don't know I just felt better. Now I'm bandaged, but not swollen, and bleeding and my rib hurts but I don't really care. it's like I cam to this weird new mental state or posivitity. It's not worth letting other people bother me. So mike said I was delappitated 3 hears ago- fuck him. I don't care what he said or thinks and I didn't wake up cursing the FC or hating anyone. I am me, that's who I was born adn I can't either make the best or the worst of it. Maybe I've screwed up in the past, and maybe people have treated me like shit, and jayeb i deserved it sometimes, but from now on, I inted to make the most of myself and be an A+ person!"

"event","Well...it is now May 12. The next time any of you see me (if you see me) I will either have a brand ner ""tippier"" nose, or be purple, swollen, bandaged, stithced and most likely resemble someone hit in the face with a frying pan a couple thousand times. (depending on when or if you visit at all). It's weird, i go through waves of fear and waves of excitement. On one hand I'm incredibly excited, when I am all said and done (in about 2 weeks) I will be one hot chick. Nice nose, normal nonbumpy lips, and some fabulous perfectly straight whiter than white teeth. (the teeth is the most exciting part!!!) but on the other hand- wow is it gonna hurt. Actually, I'm not too concerned with the after pain. I just HATE anesthesia. Waking up from anesthesia is quite possibly the WORST feeling ever. Next on my list of negatives would be the first 3 hours where my nose is packed and the first 3 days of black ugly stitches in my lip. I don't mind the nose splint or the purpleness so much, but the stitches and the packing-ick! I think when I first wake up- assuming I can move (i really hate that!!!) I will hate the FC. If I didn't hate them enough as it is. All of them, right back to freshman year when my dearest mike called me delapitated.(in the wrong context of course). I've done everything in my power these past 3 years to ""undelapitate"" myself. My mom is still up and freaking out. Her worriness makes me less worried. She however is refusing to be there when Shannon comes to visit. (My dad will be in LA tomorrow so he won't be there at all, hence my mother has to stand in his place in the father-daughter war). I told my mom it's my face, my operation, and MY sister. If I want her there, she can be there. My mom can go to corner bakery and get me some mashed potatoes or whatever it is I'll be able to eat. Speaking of which, I'm starving. I hate the whole no food after 12 rule. However, I don't want to throw up, so I guess I'll starve for a few more hours. I don't have much else to say but COME VISIT ME WHEN I'M HOME!!! AND CALL ME!!!!!I'll be at St Joseph Hospital downtown- to recieve calls. and I LOVE teddy bears! hehe jk. Seriously I just want some calls tomorrow night, or tonight, whatever- cause I will be VERY VERY VERY bored, and dude, hopsitals suck. and you can count on it that if you don't call me, I'll still call you! 
oh yea and if for some reason I die... I love you all (except *****) and thank you for everything!"

They should NOT need an 18 year old to be in the middle. It's not even like there is a right and a wrong. They're both equally right and wrong. It kind of makes me sad that they hate each other so much for no reason at all. My sister is way too spoiled- and she has a hisband to spoil her so she doesn't need my dad or his money. My dad is stubborn and not always the best father, but I don't think he means to be an asshole. He just has a lot of issues. It just upsets me and drives me crazy that I hear this all day every day. ""what'd dad say about me? where is he right now what is he really doing and what does he SAY he's doing? what did YOU get for your birthday? chanukah? why did you get that hat? don't tell dad I asked"" or ""she owes me an apology! tell her she needs to apologize to me this moment, tell her she is out of line. Don't make me look like the bad guy, I'm not the bad guy! What did she say about me? did she call me an asshole? ya know she deserves it. I'm not calling her. She can call here if she wants.

"event","It's 3:30 am. I can't sleep. I organized all my pictures into piles by year, season and then event. It took an hour an a half. I'm still awake. This week is going by so slow. I feel like it should be thursday or friday already. Why is it barely wednesday? Next week will go even slower, and so much is going to happen. A life changing event- my face- the one we all know and...know, is going to be completely altered in a mere 5 and a half days. I want it to be now. I want to be done with that pain and on to recovery. I also want teeth. I reeeeeeaaaaaallly want teeth. I don't get those back until the 19th. I think my life is a punishment. I don't know for what, but I must have done something awful. Everything is a trade-off too. I make one friend, I lose another. I am thin, therefore I am ugly. I get my belly button pierced, I have my teeth taken awayt, and so on and so on. Maybe those are not exact matchups but it seems that for every good there is a bad and that bad is bad, really bad. I don't think teeth is so much to ask for- I'd gladly give up my prada and gucci and 30 pairs of jeans. People are born with teeth, not prada, this should be natural! I'm stuck in a society, in a town, where material things and money are everything. I have those THINGS, but I lack the important stuff. I know what that is...and I have it, but once in a while I do want to be normal. and I want some teeth. I wonder what it's like to have teeth in your mouth...I think about this from time to time. I can't sleep right now because of teeth. I've been caused tons of pain, because of teeth. I hate teeth, and yet they are so important and so necessary. I wish my biggest problem right now was whitening them. I'd like to buy some whitening strips, but what good is it to have white gums? It's really hard to not have teeth. Lotsa people are missing 1...but missing 14- is a little different. I WANT TEETH!!! 
I officially hate my life. I want to be pretty and have a normal personality. I looked through my 8th grade yearbook tonight, and read about the things people planned. I said I wanted to go to Northwestern and then become a fashion designer. Rebekah wanted to own a petite clothing store- I think I was part of that, back in the day. RE petites. That's a long way away from physics. Not so long from my intended career interior decorating, but who knows...I'll probbaly become a writer. I also realized from leafing through, that I missed out on a lot of normal behavior. I guess I was socially slow. I didn't learn how to interact. I was so fucking ugly. I was immature and I had no idea. I wonder if I'm still that immature. I guess I grew up in different areas- whoop dee doo I know how to navigate a hospital and ask me anything about anesthesia, or how to put in an IV, do blood tests, disolvable stitches, lazer surgery, scar removal, open rhinoplasty,anything else you wanted to know about surgery,drawing on eyebrows, types of wigs, false teeth: dentures;implants;retainers; laughing gas;halcion; way too much orthodontia etc etc- and I could tell you in a snap. But who needs to know that stuff? especially when they are young. I was an expert by the age of 3. But what did I learn about boys or friends or hanging out- where were my social skills? Did I know about sex or drugs or even homecoming? Nope. I missed out, and I'm immature. and I hate my life and I hate being punished all the time. I just want teeth and to be able to relax. Why does g-d hate me so much???"

"event","currently, I am a toothless hag. Though I'm laughing about it now, it's not so funny when I want to eat. I hate my dentist. He kinda looks like Billy Joel. But anyways, I hate him. Hello, him and the orthodonist let me live to be 17.2 years old with many missing teeth! In my opinion that's mean! Well today I went in to get my teeth bonded. I thought this meant they would finally be the same size, not hurt, and then I'd get some beautiful new retainer with beautiful new teeth. I was wrong. Instead I got a tooth pulled, 2 teeht bonded, and the retainer with my previous teeth taken away. My dentist says he can have some fake ones made in 2 weeks. DO YOU KNOW HOW FUCKING LONG 2 WEEKS IS???  I cannot eat anything that involes chewing or is hot or is cold (basially my diet consists of luke warm mish mosh soup and lemonade that i have to microwave for 10 seconds) I look positively ridiculous when I speak or smile, I have way more of a lisp than normal (normally i have retainer speech now it's an all out lisp), and g-d damnit my teeth hurt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The other thing I find ironic is that my dentist is so fucking vain that he himself has had braces on like 3 times and dyes his greying hair a strange shade of blonde and started wearing colored contacts during his midlife crisis. I'm not saying it's wrong to be vain, but you'd think someone that vain wouldn't cause someone else so much ugliness! The only good I can think of out of my current state is that I'd give a pretty good blow job...that is if a guy wanted to look at me, and if there was a guy worth blowing. coughcoughscottmarcussocughcough. (did I mention I had a cold?)

Someone told me I was brave today. People tend to tell me that a lot. But I'm not. Bravery is something you do by choice. I am not me by choice (that I know of anyway). Jumping in front of a train to save someone's life- that's brave, fireman who chose their career and run into burning buildings- that's brave, going on roller coasters, piercing your tongue, sneaking out of the house- that is all bravery. Being born with ""problems"" and needing surgery is not brave. Whether or not I want to, I will have surgery. I HAVE to wake up everyday and live my life. I don't have the option to say ""hey I feel like not being me today"". My life at times is harder than the average north shore teenager, and easier than someone else's. But I am definitely not brave because I live it. if anything I'm more cowardly than anyone."

"event","So we're almost on our way.  In a couple weeks when the farm job is over whitney and i are heading south then southwest.  not sure whether we're heading to texas first or just oklahoma and than california.  definitely staying in northern california for a month at the most.  checking into new orleans after that.  Camping out as often as we can, putting our earth skills to the test.  As long as we stay away from freezing for the winter I'm satisfied.  
I've been going through my own personal hell for the past month, my ma's in the midst of a nervous breakdown and I can only offer her my love and frustration.  I'm convinced this whole thing is based on her financial problems and inability to relate to those around her and I don't know what to say to her about that anymore.  Apparently I'm from another planet but her life in the suburbs is not worth slaving over.  My only wish is that she pack up all the things she can take in a little flatbed pickup and build a cabin in the woods.  maybe have a llama or two and start loving life."

"event","missed the sunrise over downtown milwaukee friday morning, distracted by coffee after a long mild night.  friday was surprisingly sunny, put me in a great mood.  been losing track of time lately.  attempted to watch the sunrise saturday morning a top the reservoir with ben and nathan, it was cloudy and the sky just went from black to pink around the horizon to grey.  then as we were walking across it to leave i was distracted by my coat and hit my head on one of the old tennis court bars.  and it felt so good to no longer be 18.  
i've been ridiculously prone to bustin my shit up lately.
christmas with my ma's family was depressing.  she had made vague threats about what would happen if i let it slip that i had been traveling and not attending college.  apparently my life is horribly embarrassing to her.  though she disagrees with them as much as i do it still matters.  i'm a threat to her reputation as a successful mother?  i ask tom what the problem  really is, he says something like, ""we're worried about you, women don't hitchhike, and definetly do not hop trains.""  i gave him more credit than he deserved, thought he was more open-minded.  renegade.  so fucking typical.  a woman's place is in the kitchen and he'd much rather see me there.    
ahh yeah that makes me feel good too.
I need to get the hell out of here. again.  every time i pay a visit to mom i regress."

"event","I don't like having to shove along carrying a fucking hippo of burning desires.... like all other young children I like to prance about in the rain acid even if I've remembered to forget. Why do people get angry with other people? Why can't opinions stay fresh as such and be left to the curve for some nazi to curby them... Dots have poked my eyes dry for the last tyme and that all I get to say
p.s. for christmas I want the latest pair of nothing and partridge golden turtle and lots of dildos....this is not anyone other than the the I am Ha Ha HA Ha aha haha hah ah ah ah ah ahhahhhahahahahahahahah ah ah hha ha h ah ah ah ah ahaah  ah ha uhi oijluie is a shit face and nuff said red"

"event","a while. new pc.  it's tiny.  missed out on recording summer break.  all my digital pics are gone thanks to my neighbor and apparently lord of this comp.  still working for the farm. the old lady behind us died as did jeremy from BD. hey.. i go back to wayland in 22 days. goody.  
chances to get ""fucked up"" are passed lately.  i don't know, i think rejecting my usual meds for the past month might have something to do with it.  maybe not. hahah i'm SXE.  without the commitment.  people need to start having a little more self control.  
tonight there's an open mic party that might be worth stoppin at. i wish i knew.

no one is ever replaced, and so there is no need for jealousy, envy, bla bla blaa."

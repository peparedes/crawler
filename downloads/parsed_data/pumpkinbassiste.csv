Hello there the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

(I miss you I miss you)
(I miss you I miss you)

Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)

  i love you three,really if you weren't here, i don't know what i'd of done. taylor and alex were the 2 who budged me to church when i didn't know God, and i think we all know, i would have committed suicide if not for that. i mean,i'm not kiding. then i never would of met my whole KFC Menu! i love you guys so much and i love God for helping me and giving me the strengh to live, cuz i would've missed out on a lot, the baby's birth in Jan., 8th grade graduation, kings island, BANDette, everything!
 i'm not even mad at hannah, or anything about the alex situation for that matter, so for her and those who had to listen to me cry, i'm truely sorry,lol, because, i didn't realize yesterday or the day before that if i wouldn't have gone to church i would be dead, and i wouldn't have gotten to be with alex, or anyone for what now, 6 months longer!
 i'm so blessed. everyone who has known me before and adter church, don't you think im a lot happier. i've found myself. LOOK AT ME NOW!
 and now more than ever do i understand what God told Courtney. no man could ever love me like he could, or fill my voids like he can, and he's got good things planned for me . MY FUTURES GONNA ROCK!! if i follow him, not if i dwell on alex, or any guy for that matter God loves me.... and Christine/Foamy/ whatever you wanna be called, Katy, Brittany R, and anyone, God loves you, let him in. PLEASE LET HIM IN!!

"event","i meant to post all of this last nite but i was too busy shopping for paintball guns with taylor and joe.
 a couple days ago, i had a dream that alex and i were the same ages we are now, and we went to a place where its legal at 14 and we got married. his wedding ring was silver and mine was black.
 its so crazy because about 2 months ago, i had a silver ring like the one in the dream. alex and i were sitting together at church, and he asked to see it. i gave it to him and he said he was kepping it, lol. he wore it on his middle finger for about a week, and when i finally gave up hope on getting it back, i put a black ring on my left ring finger(wedding ring finger). al then started wearing the silver ring on his ring finger too.
 i had 2 pink bracelets that were the same. i had given him one that week , and i kept the other. he wore the ring and the bracelet until the end of school, but i don't know if he wears them now.
 the pink bracelet that i had got worn out. i wore that so much that where the plastic connects , it broke in half. i taped that thing back together and i still wear it to this day. i have never taken the black ring off my body, sometimes i tighten it ,and i put it on my toe, or i'll attach it to the pink bracelet, but i never take it off. that dream just hit me,and now i never take either off.
 i just want to be with him bad, because i love him to death. i pray for him every nite. and everytime he doesn't show up to church, it makes me worry, and love him more.
i always feel like im connected to him. i'm frequently scared that if something happened to him, he'll never know how much i love him, and we'll be separated forever.

this is from the nirvana song drain you, and i think it aplies to anyone in love "" one baby to another says i'm lucky to have met you""
i'm really lucky to have met alex!"

Now I feel as though no matter what happeneds, I don't ever need to cut or think about suicide because God loves me and he'll help me through everything,all I need to do is ask and he'll be there for me.
  I'm still having a little bit of Alex trouble. Everyone can see how much I love him, so why can't he? I've liked him for 4 years, and its been painfull and happy in those four years. He says we're best friends, and he doesn't want that to change, but his brother said that he does care for me,and that soon everything will change. Will and I have only talked for about 45 minutes, 30 minutes the other night with about 10 or 15 having to do with alex, then 10 during Christmas when I was shopping for Al's present, and then like, 5 or 6 when talking about smashing pumpkins,and alice in chains dvd's we were gonna burn for each other. Point is... 45 minutes,and he can already tell my strong feelings for alex. He can already see how much I love Al. I've tried so hard to like other guys, and I could never love them as much as I love Al. I just love him so much. I've waited so long to be with him,and I just can't see it happening.
  Rachel says i'm not fat nor ugly, courtney says the same and that I have big boobs(lol, i love you two, your my biscuits), but i don't see how I could ever be good enough for alex. he's all i've ever wanted, i love him a lot. 
  Band camp's coming up and i'm scared to leave.i don't think anyone's gonna miss me, but i'll miss them.
Rachel and I have found our 2 band members,were BANDette,and rachel is guitar and lead vocals, christy is keyboard and vocals, Emmalie(me) is bass,and courtney is drums. i have so many idea's for the band,but for rite now, i gotta call alex. love you all. Emmalie"

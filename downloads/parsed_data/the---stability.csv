"event","In the event of this new year, I took a look back on my past. I didn't like what I saw. I'm looking forward to moving on and out this year and hopefully giving up on a love that has consumed me the past two years. Here's to trying."

"event","I am most definitely in denial about the current state of my life. In a week I have moved out of my parent's house and moved in with a man. A man who I know loves me, but sometimes I'm not so sure. What I'm trying to figure out is whether or not it's all in my head. Sometimes I make such a big deal out of things that aren't even really there at all. Sometimes I feel empty when I really should be full. Obviously he loves me. But why do I sometimes feel like he isn't mine? Is it because I'm so happy that I'm scared. Why am I so scared. Maybe because he's done it before. Maybe because he has slipped away before and I'm frightened that he'll do it again because I really don't think I could handle that. Especially now that I've up and changed my whole life just so it fits better around me and him and our relationship. I like making sacrifices, I just want them to be appreciated. I just want him to know how hard this is. I want him to know that I am scared that everyone else is right and that I shouldn't have gone back to him. That I am maybe, just maybe, ruining my life. But I don't understand what ruining my life entails. Perhaps its already ruined."

"event","Yeah, I'm scared. I'm fucking terrified. Why am I doing this? What happened in the last three days to make me crawl back to him and let him kiss my lips like it hadn't been so long. I want to do what is right but then I think about it and I don't care what is right or what is wrong I just want to do what feels good. I thought I felt good yesterday but then it faded away and I didn't feel good at all. So now I am trying to figure out what is right and what is wrong and what really feels good. I want to know what makes me feel like I'm dancing in the sky and no one is watching. But I don't know. I really don't know. And I feel like I don't know him and he doesn't know me and we just spent the last year together but sometimes when he looks at me I want to cry because I'm so scared that he will leave me again and this time I will have to gather my things and pack my bags and really leave. How many times should you try to leave? How do I know that I should stay? I want to drive off a cliff."

"event","I see roadkill everyday. I wish I was roadkill. That's how I feel. I feel like someone hit me with their car and as I crumpled to the ground they continued driving. They didn't even notice. So now I am lying on the steaming black tar and my skin is sticking to it and no matter how hard I try to move I cannot. People keep running me over, again and again, going much too fast to even notice that I am there. But I am. My crushed bones become one with the road and my blood stains the yellow lines that guide your way. I am getting flatter and flatter with every person that lets their tires glide right over me. One of these days all I will be is a tiny raised portion of the road you use to drive further and further away from me. No one will even notice where I lay anymore. All there will be are a couple bones and some leftover flakes of my skin. But I will be one with the road and I will not be noticed, even though I am dead.

"event","Today would be our one-year anniversary. When I woke up my heart was beating real fast and I knew that I needed to hear your voice today, even if words I didn't want to hear came from it. But your phone is off and you're not home so I settled for your picture. I opened the weathered box that I stuffed all of our stuff in and as I started to go through it I started to cry. I read the letters you wrote me and they were all lies. You lied to me over and over and I believed you. I trusted you. I thought you were better. Every single letter was filled with lies about how much you loved me and how much you wanted to be better for me. But you never got better. Instead you sunk further and further and now you're at where you are this very day and I'm not even there with you. I cried so hard that I threw up and as I threw up my stomach bile I tried to think of anything else but you. I couldn't. When I turned on the water to wash it away I pretended I was washing you and all your lies away. I pretended that I was watching you slide slowly down the drain until I couldn't see you anymore. I want to throw up every single memory of you that I ever had because all you ever did was lie to me and now I'm finally angry. I want to drive to your house and see your face and know that it exists and then drive away and throw up all the way home. I can't take this anymore. I can't do it. I can't erase my memory and it sits there every day giving me flashbacks of what isn't even there anymore. Yesterday I went to San Diego and coincidentally went to all of the places we used to go. I kept looking up and down the streets hoping you'd be there but you weren't. I don't know where you are. I watched the people on the street and I looked at the ones holding hands and I remembered what you used to say about our hands. You said that they fit perfectly and they'd never fit with anyone else's. I hope the next person's hand you hold is much too small or large and I hope you feel the gap between your hand and hers and think about how perfect mine was for you. I hope you realize all your lies one day. I hope they catch up to you and then you will throw up but only because you're so angry with yourself for letting me down, for letting yourself down. I hope one day when you are busy doing all those things that you do to keep yourself occupied you look in the mirror and see your face and remember how you used to be. I hope you see that one of these days. But until then I will sit here, angry and upset and sick and alone, waiting for you. I will wait and wait and wait. I don't care. And when someone new comes along I will compare them to you even though there is not much to compare. I will not trust them because I will think that the letters they write me are lies and the words that flow from their mouths are lies. I will not believe anything because of you. I will be scared the whole time. And when someone new grabs my hand I will feel the space and be angry at you all over again for shoving my hand away and pushing me away. Every time I start to feel the anger fade it rises up again and I feel it like it's brand new. That's what you do to me."

I want to have my memory erased so I can start new. I want to drive really far and then turn around and cry the whole way back home. I don't want to have a home. I want to wander endlessly and aimlessly and feel no attachment to any particular face or place. I want to live on a ranch with lots of dogs and maybe some cats and wake up in the mornings to the sunshine and the open, rolling plains. I want to get out of this concrete hell and feel liberated.

I don't like staying in Oceanside all the time now and not escaping to Chula Vista. I don't like any of it. But I don't have anything to get back. I don't even know where he is or what he's thinking. For all I know he hates me now. Blames me for the whole thing. And I can't even talk to him. I can't because I have to do this. I know I have to but I just don't like it. I don't like it at all. And I want him to realize already that no other girl is me. But maybe that's what he's looking for. Someone who isn't me."

"event","Most people don't concentrate on the illuminated patch of concrete that sits directly below a streetlight. It is a very noticeable area, especially when it is dark and all that glows is the small circles which create a neat row lining the streets. One time he took me under that luminous light and kissed me so gently I hardly knew I had been kissed at all. Those are the kinds of kisses that he used to give. I felt so lucky under that streetlight. I felt like the light had soaked into me and my whole life. That's how much his kisses affected me. They went deeper than my lips and mouth and spread all over. They clung to my heart especially and that's how he tricked me into falling in love with him. I should have known better. Just because he kissed me doesn't mean that it's love. Lots of people mistake things like kisses and time for love, but just because there are kisses or you've spent a lot of time together doesn't necessarily mean that it is love. Anyway, something about the softness of the light and the way it bathed his face in warmth made me want to reach up and trace lines all over his face. I wanted to feel the bones and the flesh and then bring them closer to my own so I could kiss every single bone and every speck of flesh. This, to me, seemed like love. What is love if it isn't this feeling? I felt warm and happy and fulfilled and giddy with excitement over his butter-soft kisses. But it wasn't love. It never was. And pretty soon the kisses started getting rough and too quick. They didn't hold the same promise that they did when he used to kiss me under the glowing circles in the middle of the sidewalk. And then he wouldn't even let me touch his face. He would pull away and look at me with cold eyes that did not show any love at all. This is how I learned my lesson. I was tricked, you see."

"event","I can't even breathe. You shoved me under the blankets and left me to find air. I feel like the past year of my life I have been struggling for air. I gave and gave and even when I thought there was nothing left in me to give, I gave him some more of me. I was raw and hurting and sick on the inside but I always found something good to give. And he took from me. He took everything. Now I am left alone, even after all my effort and attempts at salvation. But really, I've been alone for a long time. He started distancing himself a long time ago, and I was clinging onto someone who didn't really love me anymore. Maybe it's because my Daddy never hugged me when I was little. Maybe because even though my Daddy lives here, he never shows love. Maybe I just needed that kind of figure in my life, even if it was tearing me up inside. But I will not tolerate the way I was treated. I will not let someone walk all over me and scream and fight and send me home so he can go fuck someone else. I will not let that happen to me. I am better and stronger and I can't feel like this anymore. I can't sleep next to him hoping that he'll wake up in the morning and hug me and ask me to stay instead of rolling over and never even touching me. Is it so wrong that I wanted to be touched? I wanted human contact with him. I wanted him to do all those things that he used to be able to do, but now everyone else got the best of him. He has turned into someone that I don't even know anymore. I look at his face and it is not the person I began dating almost a year ago. That person has vanished and been replaced with a shallow, selfish, angry, self-destructive boy who hurt the one person who loved him unconditionally. I'm not sorry it's over, I'm not sorry I met him, and I'm not sorry that there's nothing left to say."

"event","I've got a funny feeling in my stomach. It's like with each mile I drive the discomfort builds and builds in my stomach. One day, it will rise to the top and I'll vomit up all my unhappiness and anxiousness and start new again. I did some reading today and the words on the pages seemed to leap up and race each other to my head. It really hit me, all of it. All the things that they have been saying for so long. All the things that I have been denying. All the things about myself that I just don't like. It has all been stewing underneath and now it has boiled over and I feel like my flesh has been burned raw and I don't want to look at myself. A mirror can be a painful reminder of all the things you wish you could erase. Not just the things that are in plain view, but the things that lie underneath all that, the things that lie within. Sometimes my heart skips a beat, but not because I'm excited or swept away, but because it must do so to remind me that I am human. That one day, I will perish and my heart won't beat at all. When I don't see Frankie around for awhile I fear that he has left already and I wasn't able to warm his heart after all the bitterness over the years. What a shame it would be for him to die unhealthy and unhappy, alone in a tiny apartment while his ex-wives open their alimony checks. I want to get on the freeway tomorrow and just see where my car takes me. I want to run away from you and from all that I've allowed you to do to me. But I am not a victim. There are others who have suffered and will suffer much greater tragedies than this. And for that, I am sorry."

but first they burned
and lucky for them 
the water rose enough to cover 
most of their sad black trunks
but the branches that crept out
above the layer of water 
poked the sky over and over
angry for being tortured so by nature
but they stand still in the calm water
unable to tell anyone of their pain
(but I can tell just by looking at them).
It's so quiet out here
the cloudless sky stretches on and on 
I can't find the end
The sharp silence invades every last inch of me
and it rings in my ears until it isn't so silent anymore
but the noise is better than anything else I've heard lately.
And when I look at all this, 
I want to hold it in the palm of my hand
and hear this stinging silence for the rest of my lonely life 
so maybe one day I will feel the agony of the trees that were burned
and then left to drown."

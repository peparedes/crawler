"event","so what happened to days 1 and 2....? i'm tired. i'll have to work in reverse order and add those later. 

day 3: a fir ju well, col. knowledge and the lickity splits, the cuts (H)

venue: thee parkside. a tiny, fire truck-red haunt that smelled of everything college. 

upon arrival, andy and i headed to the official noisepop counter and finally got our $150 t-shirts. they're ok. but unfortunately no womens so i had to get a mens small. i should probably subscribe to a more 'indie' look anyway.

last night was pretty good at thee parkside, although we skipped the headliner, the cuts. it's ok because i really wanted to see col. knowledge and the lickity splits for ""something different."" and it was. doo-wap-y vocals circa 1960s with a heavy dose of modern rock and a few retro electronicky bits. their energy was happily frenetic, especially for such a small crowd. pretty interesting.
plus, they have a cool name.

the opener, a fir ju well had a kind of caberet pop-punk thing going on. along with the occasional squeezebox solo. quirky. their strongest songs were the jazzy piano-driven ones. (i have no idea the names of their songs. or their albums, even. if they have them.) 

on the minus side was the sound at thee parkside. not great. too loud. speaking of loud: i thought the guy manning t-shirts and buttons at the noisepop counter was going to laugh out loud when i asked for earplugs. unfortunately, andy and i could not really decipher any lyrics.  for either band, actually. and that bugs andy, as he is a lyric afficionado.

overall it was a good show, except for the sound quality. 

and i regret missing the cuts, sort of. but not really; last night was our one night off, so to speak, being that we were not dying to see anything, really. so we took it easy and went home early. of course, by 'early' i mean, 11:30ish. the opener started after 9. i surmise the cuts didn't get up on stage until midnight. a hunch. oops. did i say 'up'? i meant, they didn't walk over to the corner of the room and start playing instruments.

despite missing the cuts, i certainly enjoyed seeing who i can only guess was the lead singer, strutting around the bar in a full rabbit fur coat. (he could hang out with jenny lewis!) with over 6' of height, a lanky frame and the ubiquitous shaggy-curly mullet he actually pulled it off. tempting as it was, i did not imbibe a glass of fernet for $5, although the faux cocktail waitresses pestered. 

***

so now you may be asking, who are these lickity splits and what the hell is noisepop? well, for my birthday, andy got me the gift that keeps on giving--a badge (worth a pretty penny) to noisepop--a weeklong indie music orgy in san francisco that boasts about 180 different acts all over the city. with a badge you can roam freely from venue to venue--between 7 and 10 every night. the kicker was seeing the flaming lips at bimbo's on monday night to kick off the fesival (more to come). bimbo's is perhaps my favorite venue in the city. fantastic sound (ok, except for the glitches at the feist show, but (again) more on that to come). small and cozy, plush digs, draped walls, warm, rosy lighting, plentiful tables. and a bar with a canopy where white tuxedo jacketed men serve tiny martinis. 
plus: the flaming lips. i was effing excited. (more, i swear, to come) but now i've gotta go get ready for tonight's show: the national (H) with mark eitzal, talkdemonic, and division day"

<p>Nearly 1,000 people drawn by Internet postings and word-of-mouth converged  near San Francisco's Ferry Building on Tuesday night for a half-hour outdoor  pillow fight.  </p>
<p>The underground event erupted at 6 p.m. in the center of Justin Herman  Plaza with a mass rush of shrieking, laughing combatants  --  many of whom  arrived with pillows concealed in shopping bags, backpacks and the like.  </p>
<p>Within minutes, pillows were arcing, feathers were flying, and by the time  the Ferry Building's clock tower clanged the half-hour, the plaza and hundreds  of people were covered in white down that gave the scene a wintry lustre.  </p>
<p>""I haven't giggled so hard for a really long time,"" said San Francisco  resident Amy Davis, 35, an office manager for a construction company that  manufactures stone facades for buildings.  </p>
<p>Davis  --  who said she has been unlucky in love and was grateful for an  antidote to Valentine's Day  --  lasted for most of the battle, but pulled out  toward the end when she had her fill of breathing feathers.  </p>
<p>Like many others, Davis learned of the pillow fight from a friend who  directed her to a Web site  --  in her case it was Wikipedia  --  that gave  details about a planned flash mob pillow fight on Valentine's Day in San  Francisco.  </p>
<p>The rules for the affair were simple: Tell everyone about the upcoming  pillow fight, show up with a concealed pillow, and don't hit people without  pillows.   </p>
<p>Flash mobs, a phenomenon in which adults converge to do something silly,  rely largely on cell phones and the Internet, spreading word of events via  e-mail, chat rooms, and text messaging. Word of the pillow fight had been  circulating for weeks.  </p>
<p>It was San Francisco's first organized public pillow fight  --  some  participants thought it was the first in the United States  --  but such absurd  events have occurred in other countries.  </p>
<p>""It's just a meme. A meme is when a thought goes out and becomes part of  consciousness,"" said Amacker Bullwinkle,  a Palo Alto artist with purple  streaks in her hair who claimed affiliation with a mysterious group called the  Pillow Fight Club.   </p>
<p>Bullwinkle came with a camera and because of a knee injury mostly stayed  on the edge with about a third of the crowd who watched as hundreds of others  beat the stuffing out of each other.  </p>
<p>""No injuries, no cops and lots of smiles,"" Bullwinkle said after it was  all over.  </p>
<p>Bullwinkle did not know who organized the pillow fight, but she said many  in attendance were veterans of Burning Man, the annual art-party extravaganza  in Nevada's Black Rock Desert.  </p>
<p>But not Blitz Ono, a resident of Tokyo who has been an undergraduate at UC  Berkeley for the last two years. Ono, 22, had heard about the event from a  friend and came, pillow in hand, not knowing what to expect.  </p>
<p>""I was surprised. I didn't think people would get that serious into it,""  said an elated Ono, who was swinging the whole 30 minutes. ""I had so much fun.  It was great. It was amazing.""   </p>
<p>Edwin Coreas, 22, a San Francisco cable television installer, was equally  pleased, and glad that he found another occasion to wear the Halloween costume  he bought last year that turned him into a human kissing booth.  </p>
<p>""I'm really surprised that there are this many people,"" he said, staring  in amazement at the furiously swinging mob as he clutched a couch pillow in his  left hand.  </p>
<p>""This is pretty great.""  </p>

"event","Moral Question




This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.  By giving an honest answer, you will discover where you stand morally.



The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation in which you will have to make a decision.  Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous. Please scroll down slowly and give due consideration to each line.



THE SITUATION



You are in Louisiana, New Orleans to be specific.  There is chaos all around you caused by a hurricane with severe flooding.  This is a flood of biblical proportions.  You are photojournalist working for a major newspaper, and you're caught in the middle of this epic disaster.



The situation is nearly hopeless.  You're trying to shoot career-making photos.  There are houses, automobiles, and people swirling around you, some disappearing under the water.  Nature is unleashing all of its destructive fury.



THE TEST



Suddenly you see a man in the water.  He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken down with the debris.  You move closer.   Somehow the man looks familiar.  You suddenly realize who it is.   It's George W. Bush.   At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him under forever.



You have two options----you can try to save the life of George W. Bush, or you can shoot a dramatic Pulitzer Prize winning photo, documenting the death of one of the world's most powerful men!.





THE QUESTION



Here's the question, and please give an honest answer........



Would you select high contrast color film, or would you go with the classic simplicity of black and white?


*okay. this was in bad taste. but it made me laugh and i couldn't help myself."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Down With Fancy Book Learnin' 
What's it mean that the big cities and college towns of America all voted blue?"">

Is this why everything's so mangled? Is this why we're so divided? 
Is this why we're so damned confused and bothered and itchy and wondering why we are ever at each others' throats and ever snickering in each others' direction and ever sighing heavily and wishing we could somehow have a magic glimpse into the year 2104 to see how the hell we survive it all? 

Because there remains this astonishing and yet ever present fact: all the major cities of America, the great cultural centers and the places with the most concentrated populations and the most extraordinary restaurants and the highest percentage of college graduates and the most progressive laws and the truest sense of the arts and food and sex and music and dance and money and technology and lubricant and drugs and porn and love and fashion and spirituality, well, it seems they all voted blue. 

True. From terrorism-ravaged New York to Botox-ravaged Los Angeles, Chicago to San Francisco, Philly to Portland, Seattle and Miami and Boston and Minneapolis and Detroit -- blue as the sky, blue as the Danube, blue as the color of your soul-crushin' wine-slammin' I-need-a-bath-and-an-emetic postelection melancholy. 

And what's so frighteningly cute in a slit-your-karmic-wrists sort of way about this whole election thing is how astoundingly vicious and ingrained and apparent the Great American Culture War has become, has evolved, has mutated and grown and smiled and is right now eating us alive and belching out a great cloud of regressive, conformist exhaust. 

The stats bear it out. One look at this astounding 3-D map used by CBS News the day after the election (a.k.a.: ""Black Wednesday"") and you can see how the various cities and towns of America voted and you sit there and go oh my freaking God wouldja look at that, it's not blue state versus red state after all, but more like blue urban versus red rural, skyscraper versus church house, Chez Panisse versus Denny's. 

That is to say, it's all about population density, cultural hub, all about the much-touted ""redneck revenge"" on the ""liberal elite"" for unleashing, I suppose, small European cars and artisan cheese and ""Queer Eye"" and ""The West Wing"" on them without their express written consent. It is, in short, all about Retro vs. Metro. 

But wait, it wasn't just the big cities that went blue. It was also the tiny progressive oases, the small but potent gay-friendly intellectually curious America college towns -- almost anyplace, really, that possesses an above-average university -- that are stuck like glimmering gemstones in a sea of conservativism, that stick out like sore thumbs, like beacons, like hot blue tongues from the very mouth of regressive neocon red. 

Kansas City and St. Louis and Iowa City and New Orleans, and Athens, Georgia, Austin, Texas, Durham, North Carolina, Buffalo, New York, and Madison, Wisconsin. All blue. All towns known to be relatively quirky and progressive and safe and kid friendly and beautiful and all-American and replete with big universities and mediocre Thai restaurants and underground music scenes and healthy smatterings of gay culture and lots of gul-dang book-learnin', and every single one of 'em seems to be right in line with the big cities in understanding that Bush is utter poison to anything resembling true juicy spiritual hope or intellectual progress or really exceptional semidrunken sex. 

Is this really still the rule? The bigger and more vibrant and more vigorous and more culturally dynamic the city, or the more educated and progressive and literate the small town, the more likely they were to vote blue, Democrat, progressive, open minded, less fearful? Have we progressed almost not at all from the days prior to the Civil War, when the nation was split almost exactly as it is now? Verily, it would appear not, not so much. In fact, it's only getting worse. 


Of course, there are plenty of exceptions, plenty of well-educated culturally astute people across the land who somehow still voted for Bush, often against their own interests or deeper conscience and often for antiquated ""fiscally conservative"" reasons or because it's just how they're wired or because they think Dubya's a ""good Christian"" and therefore are willing to overlook his mountain of policy failures, or because they just can't bring themselves, even in the face of astounding proofs of Bush's incompetence, to vote for the party of Hillary and Ted Kennedy and Michael Moore. 

No, not all city dwellers voted blue. The metropolises are, of course, teeming with conservatives and lib-haters and homophobes, Republican CEOs and phallically challenged Hummer owners and decent Christian folk who don't read the newspaper. And it's also true that liberals and lesbians, tofu eaters and tree huggers, dot the country's rural burgs like sparkles on a heifer, like nails in the tire of the great conservative SUV. The divide is never, despite BushCo's insistence, that clean cut, or that obvious. 

The cultural war has always raged on one level or another, has always been a part of the blotchy American complexion. But it has never, until now, penetrated the highest positions of the land. It has never, until now, become the defining element of our society. It has never, sadly, dominated our Congress, our houses of law, our White House, our position in the world. 

But there's more to it than that, more to it than the conservative Right's hatred of same-sex marriage or French restaurants or fancy book learnin'. What to make of the astounding fact, for example, that the very places that are most in danger of attack from terrorism -- that is, places like New York, D.C., Los Angeles -- all went overwhelmingly blue? 

Put another way, if terrorism was, for the fear-drunk red states, indeed the most galvanizing issue this election, why did those places most susceptible to attack (or, in New York's case, still reeling from one) vote for Kerry in such astounding numbers? What do they know that, say, Kentucky doesn't? 

Could it be they understand that Bush has, by way of some of the most irresponsible and violent and disastrous foreign policy in American history, actually increased the chances of another terrorist attack in these places? Or that his policies will transform the current anti-Bush sentiment now raging across Europe into full-blown anti-Americanism? Or that there is more to the world than swearwords on prime-time TV or gay men sharing a wedding cake or Janet Jackson's nipple? 

Yes indeed, the Culture War has now penetrated the highest corridors of power, and the red tide has stormed in, taken control, entrenched itself, demanded regression and rollbacks and a return to old-fashioned American values, the ones that demand you read the Bible and fear foreigners and keep your damn legs closed and your mouth shut and quit asking so many prickly questions that make the president blink all confused-like. 


Yessir, I guess they showed those goddamn liberals. Guess they showed those damn college boys who's boss. Guess they showed those of us who are most at risk of terror attack and most open to change and most welcoming to the various variations of love and marriage and art and culture in this country who really owns the big stick. 

How very unfortunate, then, that we are all to be beaten with it.

"event","was that good baseball or what!?!

you can have your hockey and your NFL. you can have your basketball and your soccer.

in my book, there is nothing like post-season baseball. 

where the suspense fierce and the intensity palpable, where you leave the game feeling as if you've just been through a relationship...where the anguish across the faces of all those despairing yankee hats, brings a twinkle to your eye..and a smug, warm feeling in your heart.


the words of chronicle writer qwen knapp put it best:

""on ragged arms, on one famously damaged ankle, on dogged confidence and senseless hope, the Boston Red Sox undid baseball history this week. The abridged version of their October drama, quite simply the greatest American sports spectacle since the 1980 Olympic hockey team won gold, is that they beat the Yankees 10-3 Wednesday night to become the first club ever to rally from a 3-0 deficit and win a playoff series...they cracked 86 years of crusty New England pessimism, defied common sense and the previously understood limits of the modern athlete and, above all, pried apart the Machine that Steinbrenner Bought in the House that Ruth Built, stripping Yankee pride down to its skivvies.""


a giants fan through and through, normally i side with the national league, but folks...i'm rooting RED SOX ALL THE WAY, baby.

and as for tonight...go cards.

(though it would be sort of eerie if it turned out Texas vs. Mass....mimicking another BIG battle this year.)"

"event","unfortunately for me, though i was really enjoying the speeches last night...i only got to see a very small portion--largely consisting of bill clinton.

unlike some, and even some here, i never disliked bill. at the time i stood behind the school of thought arguing that a man's sexual life has less to do with his ability to be president--especially when he'd already proven himself.

and seeing him speak last night only solidified that clinton is indeed an incredible speaker, and a true polititian (in the positive sense of the word). as long as he is behind kerry, particularly in the eloquent (vocal) fashion that he was last night, i'm happy.

i will say one thing...i've never felt more giddy excitment to see the speeches and goings-on at the DNC than i ever have in my entire life. can't wait to get home and watch.

..if only i had cable...

another random note:
i just walked by one of the many TVs playing CNN all day long and saw, the the place where guest commentators are interviewed, ben affleck. there was even a subhead under his name reading: Ben Affleck, Actor. 
sorry, but is he supposed to represent the 'average bostonian' or some kind of political impresario...or something? just curious."

"event","i am extremely tired today. please forgive me.
somehow, i've reached the end of a long week, during which i went out nearly every night.
bastille day was wild enough. there is this tiny alley called 'belden place' in sf where lots of frenchies and wanna-be frenchies in their tre tre chic threads come out and sip wine in fabulous hats.
i, myself, wore a fabulous hat.

but no, the ally wasn't enough..and after we 
trounced over to the london wine bar, upgrading from plastic dixie cups to real glass.  normally on a school night, i'd stop after that. but something (hey i AM 24...even if i don't always act like it)took over. 
let's just say...that when i'm ordering maker's mark on the rocks...it's over.

so last night...despite a hungover day..i went to dinner at allegro with my sister(the concierge) and andy. she treated us.
it's been a while since i had such a fabulous meal...and fabulous experience.

i lived in italy. florence. for a short time.
and last night...with francesco and lorenzo (the undeniably overwhelmingly hospitable owners) i felt like i was back in italy.

everyone who sauntered into the tiny neighborhood restaurant knew one or both of them...and received kisses on each cheek.

the best way to greet a concierge who's coming to dine at your restaurant...is to give her a large glass of red wine before she even has a chance to sit down. this is the italian way.
i think we had about 10 courses in all. maybe more. we saw no menus. we saw no wine lists. our glasses were never empty.

lorenzo, who was the younger of the two owners kept his own wine glass at our lovely corner window table and would come over sit, toast us, then be back on his feet to attend his other tables. 
about halfway through the evening, just as everyone inside was getting saucy, the mexican dishwasher came out with an acoustic guitar, and donning a chef hat and super-thick nerd glasses began serenading the guests with his traditional mexican songs. now. this would have been a nice normal bit of entertainment at any other restaurant. however, this (super mario-esque) dishwasher didn't actually play the guitar. basically, he stood there, holding the neck and strumming along, mouthing the words with no apparent sense of melody or timing.

and everybody loved it.

by the end of the night...or what we thought was the end. lorenzo and francesco had pulled up chairs, given us all cigarettes (to smoke inside--which is NOT normal in SF)and flamboyantly told embarassing stories of their escapades in rome.

'we have the pope.' they kept saying. and 'but she was such a beautiful woman.'

there was, of course, no bill. and when jeni tried to tip him, he threw $20 of it back at her.  this is what it can be like dining with my sister. 

when we tried to leave the first time, they gave us more wine and begged us to sit and eat with them. obligingly, we sat and they promptly opend another bottle of wine.
that made three.

it was after midnight when we had our last laughs, said our last goodbyes and gave our last double kisses. 

it was an unforgettable dining experience, needless to say. 
obviously, i highly recommend it. 

Allegro on Jones in Russian Hill."

bear with me: i'm using one of those ergonomically correct undulating keyborads. see.i already misspelled.

i'm still getting used to it. and, i an attempt to do so, i'm goign to keep typing at a semi-quick rate. instead of stopping to pick up misspelled words as i go along. which i usually do.

it has been a long time.
things have changed.

i'm now at anice new job and, subsequently am immediately busy. the pr world, in general is known for being busy. but in my case, i stepped into a job previously unfilled for about a month. consequently some things did not get done...and now i'm scrambling to patch up all the holes.

it's not so bleak. my supervisors are extremely positive and (amazingly) vocal about it. they recognize what i recognize: that me here is a particularly good fit. on both sides.

in the past month i've been awqay a lot. first to a graduation at ucsc for my cousin chelsey, then to a cousin's wedding in seattle. finally, fourth of july.
all were good times.

the brenner parents came up on july 1 and stayed through the fourth. in fact, they only left this morning. but for the holiday, we all went up to my parents newly remodeled home in napa to celebrate. there were no firworks. but there were margaritas. and bocce. it was one of the most mellow 4ths i've had in a long time, but pleasent regardless. i was dimly afraid the brenners--andy and suzi, aside--would be blindsided by my...shall i say...robust and lively family. 
thing is, it's not just my immediate family that is gregarious, teasing and party-thriving but the whole bunch. the cousins, aunts, nephews and all the rest.

luckily, the brenners proved me completely wrong and had a wonderful time. and they said so.

it was nice to see them (the ones that don't live upstairs) all again."

""sandman's beatin' down on me.""
as my mother says.

after one day on the job, i can say that i've never been greeted so warmly. when i arrived at my new desk, there was a huge bouquet of flowers. at first i thought...andy? until i opened the card and read 'welcome to the team!'
yeah. i have a team.
it's so great.

and there was a card from everyone in food b2b congratulating and welcoming me to ketchum. tia, my supervisor, left a cool multicolored stickypad shaped like the letter k. (this journal entry, by the way, is brought to you by the letter K.)
apparently, they really like the k here.
probably because the firm's called 'ketchum.'

ketchum is a global pr firm. and i'm in the food b2b group. b2b became an oft-heard marketing buzzword back when i was a college freshman in the heart of silicon valley. older in-the-know ambitious students used it, and i quickly learned then that buzzwords really are worth knowing, if only for networking.

now i'll have it right there on my business cards. which they ordered before my first day on the job.

it's amazing how you can be in a job for so long (or even not so long)that we know isn't the best. or isn't quite right. yet you stay. in affect, wasting time. of course, you really aren't wasting time because you are always learning. you are often learning what not to do. or where not to be. you are always, slowly  carving your niche.
and that is valuable.

but i come to a place called ketchum (i kome to a place kalled ketchum). and i'm made aware, suddenly and without even yet given the chance to prove myself, how excited everyone is to have me here. how thrilled they are to have found me. and how valued i am. ALREADY. pro-pro-active employee recognition. 

it's incredible. and all i can think is, does everyone else have this kind of experience?  have i been in the dark all this time?  cause this, sure as hell, is what it should be.  i've never felt, as a reaction to their kindness, so much gumption to now go out and perform with dedication. to meet their expectations.

all i can hope is that everyone else has the same experience. or has had it.

yesterday i began orientation with several interns. stephanie, the hr director (who is so wonderful and sweet) wanted to distinguish me from the interns, since i'm a permanent employee. nearly everyone i met seemed to know who i was. i had a nice time chatting with the others between breaks, though, giving them tips on sf transportation, nonexistant parking, food and restaurants. it was fun.  many of them either just graduated or are heading back to school in the fall for senior year.

even the pace has been great so far. though pr is a very face-paced, dynamic industry, my supervisor has been taking baby steps with me and introducing me to some of the daunting tasks i will be undertaking soon.

so what do i actually do?
ketchum is a huge global pr firm with practices in healthcare, tech, branding, corporate, food and nutrition and food b2b. as i said, i am in the food b2b group, which is actually more of an integrated marketing position.
we run the gamut: marketing, pr, advertising, special events, even pitching.  i'll be doing everything from writing, creative, recipe testing and development, and media planning to billing, pitching, and special events.
it is a versatile area, which i really love.

specifically, i'm on the beef account. yeah, it's what's for work. because our client, the ncba, is federally mandated in some ways, my job is like working for the government. although, only really in billing and allocating funds.  

the first question they asked me. before the interviews: do you eat meat. yes (by god, i need a job) i do.

no. i do. i never have been a vegetarian.  and in fact, the more i learn here at work. the more likely i don't plan on it.

so hopefully now, i'll be back on lj a lot more. while looking for work, i often felt guilty and lazy if i didn't devote my entire time (on the computer) to job hunting, resume perfecting & tweaking, and emailing.  after a while, it gets to the point where you don't know where to begin.  so much happens in a week...how do i record it all. and yet, that guilt sits on my shoulders.
probably because i have an audience. even if small.
when it was a private journal. a physical thing. i would write only when i wanted to. and never forced myself. ironically, with that freedom of mind, it turned out to be quite often.
there are times when i still feel the tug of the ink and the page. strangely, i still write freeer (a word?) the old-fashioned way.

more soon on my weekend in santa barbara for my cousin's graduation. it never ceases to surprise me how zany, crazy and unique my family is. and this is my extended family i'm talking about.

missed you all. it's good to be back."

..........
there has been an onslaught of changes in my life the last month. some of which, i'm still coming to terms with. but i certainly can't complain about living in SF. a beautiful backdrop. a myriad of cultural, artistic, weird, unique, spiritual, wild, refreshing eccentricities to distract me.
and i'd be lying if i said i wasn't geographically blessed to live so close to andy. 
........


i'm no longer at google.
whew. that's out of the way.

Let me give you a backgrounder. I realize it has been a while since we last conversed.  So it seems, I am no longer at the almighty Google.   though it is a cool company--in general--it was absolutely the wrong fit for me.  i wasn't happy stifling my creative ambitions--as lofty as they may be--for the sake of a company who happens to be in the hot seat right now.

That, and the four-hour-per-day commute was truly exhausting.  Onward ho! I'm back in the job hunt arena, temping here and there, wherever I can get, while scurrying to blast emails, cover letters and resumes to any and all I can, in the after-hours.  Despite the post-google gloom, i'm upbeat.  in fact, i'm just happy to be here (in sf). and hopeful that the right thing will come along.  

along with that, i'm embarking on a volunteer thing at mcsweeney's as soon as possible.  not only is mcsweeney's cool, but so is volunteering. doesn't get much better than helping kids nurture their literary tendencies while gleening nugets of wisdom from the likes of dave eggars and his cohorts.  okay. deep down i don't see dave eggars as some kind of bay area literati superstar, untouchable to the laypeople like you or i. he's a regular guy. who has me seething in jealousy for successfully achieving what is my deepest desire.    

nah. i found early on, in honing my craft, that being around good writing rubs off on me. well. it takes a good writer to know one?  perhaps. best way to explain: like sports, when you play with or against those that are better, you inevitably rise to their level. simple.

and i intend to do it."

"event","like andy, i too have recently encountered limits at work. namely, i happen to work for a company--probably one of the only companies--with both the manpower and the brainpower to closely moniter my internet/email/lj interactions.  

though emailing and posting to lj aren't considered inherently bad, here, they are watched. so i've been made aware, during recent feedback.

it makes me sad to say that i, too, will be posting less while at work, unless during my lunch break.  this will most certainly mean, my posting from the intimacy of my comfortable, familiar mac, versus the obtrusive, banal and awkward work pc.  perhaps it'll spawn some more creative, juicy, complex, 'think different' posts.

on the flip side, however, i've figured out how to listen to the radio at work. today.  previously i linked into several radio shows regularly including: kcrw, bbc, and npr. those being a few of my outlets to keep me on the brink of new music.
we all have our sources. while andy keeps me updated on the indie-rock scene, i must in turn, keep him up on the brit-pop scene.

only restriction now: i can only listen via window's media player.  ouch. but, using the search option i was able to stream several npr programs.  unfortunately, it looks like wmp gets access to old npr shows after a great delay.  on searching for episode 61, 38 was the highest they could find.
bleh.

any suggestions on good radio stations that connect to wmp?

by the by, still enjoying all the posts from everyone else. just because i'm writing less doesn't mean i'm not reading my friends page."

"event","near the back of the bus a man sat on the 45, heading south. it was 7:18. am.
except for the whirling dynamics of the overhead cables, as the bus lurched and receded weaving down stockton street, it was silent.  as buses often are in the early morning hours. one of the unspoken manners of urban public transportation riders tend to adopt.
unassuming, sandy-haired, i first noticed the look of intense concentration on his face as he slowly closed and reopened his eyes.
if i hadn't been sitting directly opposite him, it's doubtful i would have even noticed he was there.

it was then that i looked down and saw that he clutched a rosary between his fingers. nimbly, he rubbed the worn black beads between his figures closing his eyes again as he reached a new one.

i could feel his prayers boring into the beads.  what was he praying for?  or who?
a large white box with plastic handle portruding from the top sat at his side.  

as he pressed each bead i thought of my own prayers. when was the last time i said the rosary?  

i wondered if this was something he did as a matter of course. routine. like flossing your teeth. my brother once flossed his teeth while driving down redwood road. i sat in the passenger seat as he leaned over, yanked open the glove box, and fished out his floss.  wordlessly, he proceeded to clean his gums.
as if he'd forgotten to take a pill. or call someone back. and had to do it at that very moment before it escaped his mind again.

did this man's rosary-saying stem from the same form of habit?  was work THAT bad? or was his aunt undergoing triple-bypass surgery that very evening?

maybe he finds sanctuary in his rosary?  
and the rest of us just have ipods."

"event","last night, as my sister and i drove home from portrero hill, we got a phone call from my mother. this is nothing unusual. i sometimes receive calls from my mother more often than my boyfriend.

portrero hill is dark, dismal, and industrial. but somehow comforting in its decrepit brick werehouses and sparse lofts. i was flipping the car around and so jeni answered. 

moments later she was sounding out the name of someone i was supposed to know. i could faintly hear my mom on the other end...
'eric..hor..hor...horn..horsh...horshner...'

'hornisher.' i said flatly.
eric hornisher.

mentally scraping the walls of my memory i tried to understand how...or where i knew this name. that came to me so effortlessly. the image of a blond, fair-skinned and quiet slowly conjured. and i was reminded of our last conversation. three weeks ago. at a bar.

""he passed away 'unexpectedly' monday.""

i'd been sitting at the bar with two work collegues having a farewell drink and celebrating my moving on. the first had left to meet friends in san francisco--an hour's distance away. the second, mother of two, and bath time pulled her away. i was left alone by 9.

in a crowded bar.  

i saw eric with his parents and immediately recognized him as the one guy from my hometown who also went to my (small) college. though we weren't anything more than acquaintances, i felt some kind of connection, since we were both from the same place.

he struck me as quiet, studious, focused and ever so slightly odd.  

""wouldn't they have said, 'he passed away'...as a result of something?"" my sister pried. ""do you think it was suicide?""

suicide. was possible. but...why? her words rang in my ears as i remembered eric. blond-haired, soft-spoken engineering-major eric. walking from shadow into sunlight, beneath my freshman dorm, weeks after college first began for both of us, and when i'd first recognized him.

he never really smiled much. i remembered that as well.

but who was i to say? it wasn't as if i could even have called him a friend.  and our conversation, years after college, but only three weeks ago, proved that. 

sitting alone at the bar, willing the lechy man next to me to please not start talking to me, i was unusually eager to catch a familiar face. 

i'd recognized him and said hello. though he looked at me with the same recognition, the first words out of his mouth were ""do i know you?""

""yes. we went to school together. santa clara.""

""oh. and what did you study?""

""marketing. fine art. engineering right?""

""yep. i was pretty busy with engineering, that's probably why I was never around.""
i blinked.

""did you like it?""

""sure. santa clara. i got a lot out of my tuition with the two schools. you?""

""mm hmm.""

and he peered at me. unblinking. focused. and that was when he smiled. 
then said, ""you know...we should have hung out more.""

""yeah."" and i smiled back. 


at work today i pulled up the napa register online to read his obituary. 
eric john hornisher unexpectedly passed away Monday, April 19, 2004.

there it was. the 'unexpectedly.' the unexplained, indecipherable 'unexpectedly.' 

eagle scout. cum laude. computer-based satellite tracking system. honors student. strong faith in God. zest for life. reader of philosophy. trombonist. 
phrases from the article jumped out at me like slaps across the face.

i'm not sure if it was the 'unexpectedly' that consumed me with such grief. or our last conversation. the recency in which i'd last seen and spoken to him.

or that somehow, i always...and even recently...sensed a sadness around him. 

and that now he left some of that sadness with me."

<lj-cut text=""SADDAM'S 
INTERROGATION LOGS""> 

BY BRIAN M. SACK 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 0735 hours 

Colonel Beckwith and I decided to play Good Cop/Bad Cop again. I came into the room as Bad Cop and yelled at SH. He immediately laughed at me because last week when I came in I was Good Cop and had given him a sandwich. I tried to play it off that I had some heartburn and was still Good Cop but ""just a little cranky."" Colonel Beckwith tried to cover for me by entering the room as Bad Cop and yelling, but that didn't seem to work either. SH muttered something but wouldn't say what. 

Interrogation terminated: 0749 hours 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 1430 hours 

I tried to break the will of SH by showing him an Iraqi newspaper editorial calling for his trial and punishment. SH told me that our Psychological Ops folks obviously printed a fake newspaper. I told him I swore that I bought the paper at an off-base coffeehouse. He insisted it was a fake. I told him I crossed my heart. He said he did not believe me. I asked him what I needed to do to prove to him that it was a real newspaper and he suggested taking him to the off-base coffeehouse to see it firsthand. I asked, but Gen. Farley said absolutely no way. SH didn't say anything else aside from asking how much my PsyOps newspaper subscription cost and if there were any PsyOps coupons in it. I asked where the WMD were and he suggested I look in my copy of PsyOps Weekly. 

Interrogation terminated: 1540 hours 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 0330 hours 

Woke SH quite early to catch him off-guard and groggy. I asked, ""What's your first name?"" and he said, ""Saddam."" Again I asked, ""What's your first name?"" and he said, ""Saddam."" I kept asking, ""What's your first name?"" and he kept saying, ""Saddam."" Once I had a rhythm going, I quickly asked, ""Where are the WMD?"" and he said, ""Saddam."" 

Interrogation terminated: 0338 hours 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 2210 hours 

I played chess with SH, who is not too bad a chess player. At one point, my bishop took his rook. I told him that in the U.S., when you lose your rook to a bishop, it is customary to divulge a little personal secret, like maybe where the WMD are. He said we weren't in the U.S., then he took my pawn with the horse piece. 

Interrogation terminated: 0122 hours 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 2000 hours 

I told SH that we would be paid a visit by Baghdad's longest-running improvisational comedy troupe, and that they often ask for audience suggestions. I had one of the players ask SH for the name of something you'd return to a department store. He said ""pliers."" They did a quick scene about returning pliers, and then another ""player"" asked for a geographic location where one might hide WMDs. SH was quiet for a long time, and so I suggested Wal-Mart. 

Interrogation terminated: 0122 hours 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 1241 hours 

After lunch, SH informed us he was willing to talk. Colonel Beckwith and I sat down with him. He spoke for quite some time and answered every question fully. We believe we have made great progress and we are researching the data. 

Interrogation terminated: 1551 hours 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 0940 hours 

Colonel Beckwith and I told SH that we didn't think it was particularly funny that he had us looking for ""Monkey Valley"" and the ""Camel Ass Testing Facility"" when, it turned out, there were no such locations. Also, we told him we were unable to verify the existence of Mohammad Mohahaha and we do not believe his claims of having built an ""infidel ray."" We told him that, as a result of our disappointment, we would be denying his TV access. He said TV sucks anyway because they don't sing about him anymore. 

Interrogation terminated: 1100 hours 

- - - -

Interrogation commenced: 0250 hours 

I roused SH from his slumbers and told him Tariq Aziz was on the phone and wanted to know where the VX gas was. Didn't bite. 

Interrogation terminated: 0252 hours

"event","up at 6:15. shower. out the door. arrive at work by 8:45.
 
i have a bit of a commute.
but so far, its only bothersome on my way home--the lull of the evening hanging in the air...dissolving into dusk. 

when i know the shops will be closed and i'll have to put off buying that two-pronged surge protector until this weekend. 

what it's like working here (and by 'here' i'm assuming you know where i mean--the NDAs are haunting me) is, in many ways, just the way you'd imagine it.
young.
hip.
fun.
scooters.
abundent, healthy and not-so-healthy food. all of it free.

there are scooters people ride. and lots of jeans.
pretty much feels like college. in my department, that is. which, surprisingly, is not always a good thing.

still can't listen to music, though i ache for it. still too new.

the most ironic thing about what i do is the porn. yep. basically QA-ing sites all day long, many of which are utterly pornographic.
we allow it. but it has to be regulated. correctly identified, to prevent little billy in 3rd grade from looking up 'rabbit' for his search report only to find something quite different.

and of course, there are certain varieties of porn, which are not allowed. its not hard to imagine what these are.

this morning, i've just settled in with my second hot cup of coffee. ready to go. first ad that pops up. porn.
its one way to start the day. 

okay doug, i know what you're thinking. gee whiz. what a cool job. 
but its not all porn. i don't know...after a certain amount, you reach a saturation. 
or maybe its because i'm more stimulated by physical sensuality. vs. electronic images.
maybe its that i'm surrounded by a ton of coworkers in an office (albeit, unconventional) sipping hot coffee, still settling into the morning.

sometimes i do wonder if it ever gets to anybody. (okay, i'm thinking of one gender, lets be honest.) and they simply cover it well.

hehehe."

"event","i want to write all about GOOGLE. and i'm sure many of you want to hear about it. and who wouldn't? its google. its a verb. its a place. its part of your life. and mine.

but i am so tired. since i'm living in nob hill, in the northern part of SF, and the googleplex is down in mountain view, i have to leave at the crack of dawn. say before seven. and i get home around 8. a bit before.

yep.

11 hours door to door. and being in training all week. and not being in front of computer. with endless, uninhibited internet (and therefore email) all day. like i'm used to. like we're all used to.  is why i haven't written in a while.

its no real excuse since i have internet access at home. but its an attempt.

i'm not really sure who checks this often and who could care less. but i've written up until now as if only a few people were reading. because they were. i hadn't given the address out to anyone save a few close individuals.  now that i've done the mass email, i'm not so sure. i feel a bit exposed (as andy put it) and that is actually ok. with me.

the writer part of me. the wannabe. finds it a bit thrilling.
could be my imagination, though, and, really, the same three are the only ones taking notice.

so. google. there's so much to say, and yet so much i cannot say. at google, most everything is classified. which means i had to sign a few non-disclosure agreements before they took my direct deposit info.  its a bit unnerving. and hard. but i have to try and not talk about it. or be vague. which is sometimes harder.

its a hot company right now. there couldn't have been a better thing to say, when leaving my old job than 'i've accepted a position at google.'
when that very week, about six different media outlets featured google in some way or another. new york times. newsweek.  television morning programs. wired.

later this week i'll write more about the food, the culture, what its been like, and on.
its fun. only thing i perceive as a potential problem for me. a burnout, really. is the commute the 11 hours will wear me down. no doubt.

but. for now, i'll get paid to analyze ad sites. yes, including porn."

Test takes chefs to breaking point
By MICHAEL HILL
Associated Press Writer

March 26, 2004, 12:04 PM EST

HYDE PARK, N.Y. -- Adam Busby pivots abruptly from counter to range. Face flushed, he flips fillets into a crackling pan. 

Minutes are ticking down for him to finish the meal of his life. But his gnocchi remains uncooked, his pork unsliced. 

Five hours ago, Busby was given some basic ingredients _ pork butt, red mullet, cabbage and little else _ and told to make magic. 

It was, in effect, his final exam after days of braising, baking and sudden-death menu making, as he and a few others worked to earn the designation of Certified Master Chef, the super-select top rung of American cooking. 

But first, the 40-year-old chef must pull this off. 

""Where'd the pan go?"" 

He finds and grabs it, slices the pork, calls for sage. 

A judge shouts a warning: 

""Fifteen seconds."" 

___ 

The Certified Master Chef test runs 10 days from dawn to dark at the Culinary Institute of America's campus by the Hudson River. 

It shares some traits with the bar exam, a marathon, ""Iron Chef,"" boot camp and murder mysteries where characters get picked off one by one. But it is unique for its under-the-gun cooking trials. Chefs must produce the finest tournedos, tortillas and mahi mahi day after day to leave with a black master chef pin on their double-breasted whites and the ""CMC"" after their names. 

The five candidates who took the test this year _ successful chefs who manage country club restaurants and teach _ paid $3,000 each plus expenses. 

And some of them, they knew, would not pass. 

___ 

Cooking begins before dawn on Day 2. 

As students in paper toques get the kitchen ready, master chef candidates huddle with their apprentices across the hall offering fine points on marinades and parsley prep. 

Candidates were each given a different ""mystery basket"" of ingredients _ perhaps monkfish, pork or rabbit. 

They are told to create a four-course menu in 30 minutes, observing strict limits on calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates and sodium. Then, the chefs must cook the meal _ for 10 _ in four hours. 

""I'm going out on a limb here,"" says Busby, deciding to write a Thai menu. 

The other test-takers are James Corwell, who's 36, and, like Busby, on the faculty at the culinary institute's Greystone campus in California; Paul Ramsey, executive chef at a North Carolina golf resort; Aidan Murphy, executive chef at a St. Louis country club; and a midwestern chef who would drop out about halfway through. 

Chefs work in stations a spatula toss from each other. As apprentices skitter by with hot pots, Busby quickly pans rabbit, grates a lime peel and builds his meal. 

Watching it all with a pencil and a clipboard is Chef Russell Scott, one of the master chefs judging the candidates. 

Today he considers kitchen craft. He notes knife cuts. He dips a spoon into saucepans. He pokes his pencil through garbage-bound pans of stalks and peels. 

Over the hours, dishes of braised monkfish and herb-crusted beef are coming together. At the end, one after another the candidates plate their food so it can be whisked down the hall for judging. 

""Take it away,"" Ramsey says for a salad, only to instantly shout, ""Wait!"" He forgot spiced almonds on some plates. 

With under a minute left, Busby is still garnishing his soup. The limb he's gone out on might be breaking. But he gets it out just under the wire and high-fives his apprentice. 

The relief doesn't last long. In the judging room later, a stern-faced Chef Victor Gielisse paces before two long tables that look like a dream buffet of calamari and glazed pork loin laid out on white china. 

He motions to these concoctions as if they were blue-plate specials. 

""This spinach here,"" he says, ""full of sand!"" 

Other judges' comments can be just as tough: Limp flavors, undercooked lamb, the food tasted hurried. 

The master chef candidates are warned: They must do better if they expect to pass. 

___ 

Of 2 million trained cooks in the United States, about 60 are certified master chefs. 

While many chefs are great at, say, Mediterranean or Southwest cooking, a master chef must excel in American, classical and international cuisines, as well as cold buffets and nutritional cooking. Minor sections of the test deal with things like wines and cost control. Masters must do everything well. 

Candidates spend months leading up to the test consumed with cook books and fine points of charcuterie. Murphy jogged to build endurance. Corwell, who is lean, tried to put on a few pounds for extra fuel. 

All prepared by cooking. Busby and Corwell even practiced timed cooking drills with a master chef. 

""For the last year, it's in the back of my mind every time I take a knife out,"" Busby says. 

___ 

Day 6. 

Spanish onions are straight ahead. Chervil and apples are in the coolers to the left, beans to the right. 

Another day, another mystery basket. Another assignment: a three-course American meal. The chefs can pick extra ingredients from a storeroom, but they only have 20 minutes. 

Corwell, jotting notes and moving double-time, feels like he's in a reality TV show. He grabs one red pepper _ no, two. Four limes. Are there plantains? 

The test is getting harder. Candidates have little time to think. Good decisions, and good cooking, must come instinctively. Fail two major segments and you're out. One candidate withdrew the night before. 

Fatigue is causing Corwell to forget things he knows. ""It's like I fall into potholes,"" he says. 

By evening, even the judges are drinking triple espressos. 

Busby, with his tall frame, seems to bound from burner to counter _ ""almost thrashing"" one judge says later. Corwell, by contrast, grills his goose with economy of movement. Murphy looks over his shoulder at the clock. 

Not enough time. 

Murphy will miss his window, costing him crucial points on a night he will fail. He not only manages to smile amid his misfortune, but embraces his disappointed apprentice. 

""You did a good job,"" Murphy says. ""It's one of those days."" 

At judging this night, Corwell's goose is deemed chewy. Ramsey's sausage is compared to meatloaf. But the dressing down of Day 2 has given way to collegial one-on-one reviews. Busby gets kudos for having ""the eye of the tiger"" in the kitchen. Gielisse, so dismissive on Day 2, is avuncular. 

""You need to take a deep breath,"" he tells Corwell, ""and pop a couple of Motrins."" 

___ 

The Certified Master Chef Exam was created in 1981 by the American Culinary Federation, a professional group. As American cooking came of age, chefs wanted to create a meaningful master standard like those in Europe, only tougher. 

""In America, we needed to be above anything and everything so we could stand up to the scrutiny,"" said Ferdinand Metz, a driving force in the standards and an early CMC. 

Still, many great chefs never take the test. Big names in cooking _ Paul Prudhomme, Wolfgang Puck _ are not certified masters. 

Of those who do take the test, more than eight of ten test takers fail. 

Chef Anthony Bourdain, author of ""Kitchen Confidential,"" says the test, which stresses rarely used techniques like making aspic, is sneered at by restaurant chefs, though he admires people who do it. 

Metz says the standards have helped American cooking. Test takers are serious about the craft, he says, and willing to risk failure. There are chefs with fame and fortune who won't assume that risk, he says. 

___ 

Day 10 is like capping nine days of mountain climbing with cliff scaling. It accounts for half a candidate's score. 

A morning devoted to cooking is just the warmup for one final mystery basket. 

The day is do or die for Murphy and Ramsey, who each failed one major section. Busby and Corwell have passed everything and can get a pin tonight with a strong showing. 

In the kitchen, Corwell cuts up a veal shoulder. Murphy snips open Arctic char. The ""shik, shik"" of knives sharpening is drowned out by shrieking blenders. 

Corwell makes crabmeat ravioli like a jeweler, hunching down close as he cuts out perfect round pillows. The strain shows in his glassy eyes. 

Busby bellies to the floor to retrieve a pan lid under his stove. To make it through this last day, he sets a picture of his wife and baby daughter on his counter. 

Busby conjures a complex meal with seared red mullet and milk-braised pork. But he has lost crucial minutes during menu writing by requesting items not available. 

Will it cost him during plating? As Busby works, apprentice Christopher Lyons reaches over his shoulder to pan flip the gnocchi. 

Scott calls, ""15 seconds!"" 

Busby is still garnishing. Proctors look on gravely, but Busby is consciously taking advantage of each second. 

He waves off the last plate as time expires. 

___ 

Judging lasts into the evening, leaving the four chefs to stew in their juices. 

Ramsey is called in first. He didn't make it. Murphy gets the bad news next. ""Hey, it was only 10 days of my life,"" he says. 

Corwell is called, leaving Busby pacing. The mood is grim until Corwell comes back holding a master chef certificate. The apprentices applaud. 

""I did it,"" the smiling chef exclaims. 

Busby enters the judging room next. 

When he emerges a short time later, he's beaming. He stretches his arm over the shoulders of Lyons, his apprentice, and the pair lurches down the hall like giddy drunks. 

A black pin is attached to Busby's whites.</lj-cut>"

"event","for over a year now, i've lived alone. 
relishing in the carefree nakedness, the certitude of uninterrupted silence, and the luxury of always getting to play my music.  
no surprises. no compromises.
it's truly truly selfish, living alone. every decision is made in your favor. every battle, you win. whenever you are sick and moany, the room is a darkened cave of solitude, movies and used tissues scattered about the floor. on raucous Friday nights, you're free to invite the whole neighborhood over for a boozy, obnoxious after-party.
you can have sex as loud as you want.
wherever you want.

it's zealously indulgent. 

by and by i'm realizing, even i've taken it for granted. 
for, not long from now, i'll be back in the throes of sharing space with a roommate. now, my roommate will be my sister. and that makes the transition much easier. none of the getting-to-know-you rites of passage to endure. i already know what pisses her off. and she me.

but as my time dwindles and comes to an end, i'm desperately trying to live out the glories of what it means to live alone, one last time, before they are absent."

"event","i've set a new personal record: in and out of the dmv in 20 minutes. i know. you can congratulate me.
as it so happens, with the dawn of my 24th birthday, my license expired. since i have been using the same one since i first started driving, at 16, it was time for a new pic. had enough skeptical once-overs by hesitant bouncers.
two guys who i'd been chatting with in line, graciously let me run outside to check my license plate number. i had it right.

it's sad, but i have to admit that i woke up about an hour early so i could do my hair. these days i've been blowing it dry straight, as many of you have seen, and complimented.  my whole life, i've let it run amok, allowing the curls to spiral wildly out of control. my hair is unruly, by nature.
but since the hairdresser one day decided to blow it dry straight, in that magical way hairdressers can coax your tresses into submission. nearly everyone i knew immediately 'loved it.'  they responded with such attention and enthusiasm, like someone who's lost 20 lbs, i couldn't help but commit to the hairstyle. how does one ignore being bowled over with compliments? the truth is, i liked it too. it felt new. refreshing. indulgent, even. so, to say i only continued because of the pleas of others is bullocks. i did it for myself.

just because my shiny new drivers license picture will boast my confident, older, straight glossy locks, does not mean i'm done with my curls for good.

(dear god, this HAS actually turned into a 'hair' column...my apologies)

i like them. i like the versatility. some day's i'll wear bright blue stilettos. and some days i'll wear black flats. some days i'll be curly and some days i'll be straight. 

thing is, getting back to the dmv, it was really painless this morning. i had to get there before it opened, at 8am; therein lies the key (pun!). if you show up at some 9 or 10am during the week, its no good. sure to be there an hour. perhaps i went in expecting to be there an hour and was so overjoyed to be fourth in line, i couldn't help but be relieved."

"event","yesterday i wrote a beautiful profound detailed entry all about the incredible changes that occurred in my life, in a matter of four days.
birthday, i had.
interview, i had.
job offer, i had.
change of address, i had.  ok. that happened about two weeks ago.

isn't it weird how in journalling, we document the most mundane uneventful moments of our lives with incredible immediacy, and yet profound (i said it again) changes take place. pivoting my life in a new direction. entirely. and nothing is recorded. as if nothing significant happened. it's too liveable to stop and write.
too much living to do.  
yet i could look back years from now, perusing my journals, and find nothing on the subject. the guilt consumes me.

so i had a birthday.
i am a whole 24 years in existence. young, you're all saying. young young young young young.  yeah well.

so i had a long birthday weekend. since last years was more of an afterthought, this year, mom, particularly wanted to make it special. memorable.
it was. 
taking three days off helped. 

where to start?  st. patrick's day. Wednesday.
i was lucky to land not one but two fine interviews on one green holiday. so i called in sick, instead of calling in 'job interview'. couldn't afford to risk losing that security blanket of my old job just yet, in case nothing worked out (again) and i had to trod back, soddenly, sans job offer.  and imagining daggers through the eyes of the one who snagged the position over me.

but we're not there yet. we're actually on our way to the first interview. (pardon my shifting POVs and tenses like shifting gears in a porche; enjoy the ride)
since it's nearly impossible to be in mountain view, a city south of san francisco by 45 minutes (sans traffic), by 10am when leaving from a city north of napa by 1 hour (sans traffic), i decided to drive down the night before. and leave from sf in the morning, refreshed, prepared to become the one they choose.
so i did.

when i arrived in the sunny manicured parking lot of the oh-so-silicon-valley corporate park. glimpses of office space flashed through my memory.  but this company is much cooler. 
it's more than a company. its a verb. and it hearkens back to the dot-com heydays, when employees rolled in at 10am in their pajamas for work. and played foosball during lunch. after working out in the free company gym. and had a massage.  

it is in fact google.

so i walk into google, after circling the lot about four times. and there is a nice, hip waiting room. lots of color. looks like crayola came over and did the decorating. as you'd imagine, red, yellow and blue are the primary (double-entendre) shades they've used. with splashes of green here and there. the receptionist has me sign in, electronically, on a computer, signing waivers 'i won't discuss the goings-on that occur within google's walls with anyone human or animal who i may or may not know, even my own mother. whereupon, a little white sticker buzzes out. a receipt, i think. but no. a badge. an official badge. with my name emblazoned on it. like being invited to have lunch at the cool kids table, i'm in, i think. and stride confidently through the heavy white door.

to be honest, the interview was simple, straightforward, and unintimidating. for the second step in the recruiting process, i'd already filled out a lengthy worksheet designed like an essay exam. it was approved.  i believe google weeds people out early on. they must receive a ton of applications.  especially with the IPO coming out.
'how do you feel about working independently?' she asked, looking no older than 21 and as if she were heading to a kegger right after work. she wore a faded yellow 'luck of the irish' t-shirt for st. patricks day. and i was about to ask her if she went to notre dame, but we finished and it was time for my writing test.
later, i thought, people must think that about me, sometimes, remembering i was 10 years younger than everyone in my office.

and since i'm not supposed to discuss the goings-on at google. i won't go into detail. but i finished with a lovely hr woman named lisa who said, without me prodding, 'i'll call you on Friday, regardless.'  hmph. i thought. i've heard that before. but she proved true to her word.

though my second interview of the day was scheduled for 6pm, i managed to get it moved up to 2pm after barb called me back. barb granted me an 'informational interview' upon my pleading in an email i'd written the week before. she was a friend of a friend, and knew i'd come calling. i did. 

she works (and founded!) what may as well be summed up as my ultimate 'dream job.' no sense beating around the bush. mcsweeney's is a non-conformist, unique, highly intellectual, eclectic, zany, highly clever, sometimes indulgent but at heart literary publishing house. its everything i want to be. well. maybe not everything. but i really admire the work.  check it out at mcsweeneys.net. they publish a small, but growing collection of titles including several books (not many) and two literary journals. they are a bit elitist. which i forgot to mention in the multi-adjective description. picture the music store featured in nick hornby's 'high fidelity' and you'll get an idea of what i mean. though, they as people, are hardly elitist. think: laid back. think: bookish. think: mission district.

and that's where i was. 

outside, on a chair in the sunny backyard of an old victorian, our interview took place.  826 valencia is both a pirate store (arrrr) where you can purchase black eye patches along with the publications. and a tutoring/workshop location for teachers and elementary school classes.  it is one half non-profit and one half for-profit.  with the newly purchased house turned office next door, still under construction, barb and i had to meander around to find a private space for our chat.

the settings of my two interviews couldn't be more different.  google: huge, cubicle land, dot-com, corporate park-strip mall, but casual jeans.  mcsweeney's: laaaaid back, barefoot, artsy-nerdsy, sitting on pillows on the floors in front of their powerbooks. all mac.  a cubicle is a nightmare to these people. or so it would seem.
i felt out of place with my suit on and wished i'd changed. i wanted to clap my hands and shout: 'i don't really dress like this. i don't live in the marina. i'm one of you, i swear. i've worn dresses over my pants before... and listen to indie music. please believe me.' but i held back. this feels right i thought. this is where i want to be. 

just an informational, though. and nothing more. 

i went in expecting no job offer and came away with no job offer. but i didn't come away dispirited.  barb was really cool. and we talked about my editing skills, my writing skills, and my experience.  i told her how much i'd love to be a part of mcsweeney's in any way. and she seemed really positive and genuine when she said that she would most definitely keep me in mind for any upcoming opportunities.  which could be 'right around the bend.'  but she understood that i was indeed moving to sf and therefore needed an income i could count on immediately.

the best part was that she encouraged me to submit my own pieces. though i always knew it was a possibility, and many people close to me have said those very same words before, it felt more profound hearing them from her. she is the publisher. she is mcsweeney's. not the editor, or the designer. and coming from someone obviously well-read, who pores through countless submissions by established, talented writers felt surreal. too good to be true. i could have plucked that moment and put it into a dream.  suffice to say, i left inspired. mcsweeney's is still my goal. even if they're not putting my name on business cards just yet.

celebration was in order. not only for me-it was st. patrick's day! i'd nearly forgotten.  it was off to the irish bank, a pub downtown, where green-clad boozers filled the alley and spilled into the street.  i met up with jeni, jordan, trish, heather, ty, and some other friends of friends.  we drank. we toasted. we took photos. the luck of the irish was with me, i hoped, recollecting the events of the day.  it was with all of SF, apparently, as the temperature rose to an unusual 78-80 degrees and stayed fairly warm throughout the night.  by the time i met up with andy, post-siemens santa cruz retreat and hankering for something a bit less raucous, i was sauced. coherent. but wanting to remain a bit raucous. he bellied up, though, if reluctant. you can't go to notre dame AND be irish (and be best friends with doug mckenna) without feeling obliged to have a beer on st. patty's day. it doesn't sit right in your conscious.  

at one point we tried murphy's pub in north beach, to find a line around the block. a line so unbelievable, so unprecedented in sf (that i'd seen) that you had to wonder if a) they were giving out free beer or b) there was a rollercoaster at the end. neither. we moved on.

ended up at fiddler's green, a tri-level pub with dancing on the second level.  jeni and i did a little dancing on the dance floor. after i got half a pint bumped down my shirt for the second time that evening, and realized the hunger pangs felt stronger than my own drunkenness, we decided to go. my feet started to ache, and all i wanted was to lie down-as that's all you ever want when you start to sober up at the end of the night-but we sought food. after walking in and out of in and out (it smelled like sewage) we found a little pizza place, where i took a picture of andy looking pissy and tired. though the expression in reality was more like 'why are you taking my photo, you silly, drunk girl?'  i think its hilarious.  

the next day, as my sister relived the holiday through a nasty hangover, i ran some errands. enjoying my second 'sick day' of the week. jordan and i stopped for an ice cream cone on our way back up nobby hill when i got a phone call. mint chocolate chip in hand, i grabbed my cell and answered it. lisa from google was on the line. 
she offered me the job.
i accepted without much hesitation.  it felt quick. but since i didn't have any other offers coming in anytime soon, i figured i'd go for it.  i start on April 6.  which meant, i had to give notice on Monday. i was planning on it anyway. but to have it all work out so perfectly felt like i'd made the right decision.  my heart still lies with mcsweeney's. and if they happen to call, i'm there. but for the time being, i think google will be a wonderful experience.  and a spark to my resume.  

Friday night i had previously asked for a 'personal day.' so it was legal to stay home again.   woke late, and spent the morning doing one of my favorite things: working on my computer and reading at a coffee shop. later, i watched a disturbing but captivating movie, thirteen, before my parents arrived to prep for the party that night.  
it was a going away jon/happy birthday party for me.  held at 1370 washington number 3. fantastic. saw lots of old friends i hadn't spent time with in too long. it made my birthday particularly special simply by many of them just showing up.  

among soap, slippers and a plastic sparkly blue tiara that i wore all night, i received the new ipod earphones from suzi and rick as an early birthday present.  they're terrific. great sound. sit softly, unobtrusively in your ear balls. and they're the cheapest thing for sale at the apple store.  get yours today!

Saturday night we had a big family dinner, as is the custom in the borreson household, complete with boyfriends and girlfriends. but no other friends.  restaurant sofia is located on the top of nob hill, the part the plateaus in a crest of towering glamorous hotels.  situated in the fairmont hotel, and occupying the former space of the tonga room, it is exquisitely, expertly designed. as the general manager said, 'they started with a gorgeous room, and made it even more beautiful.'  fluttery cape cod sheer white drapes help compartmentalize the funky post-modern interior. by combining some classic, some eccentric, and some minimal pieces in the large bar you feel at once elegant, hip and comfortable.  its the kind of place i want to revisit over and over.  

the finishing touch at the sofia?  giant puffs of smurf-blue cotton candy billowing out of tiny juice glasses are brought with the check. la. 

we befit the elegant, round table in the center of the dining room well. and so did the double magnum of franciscan cabernet we brought.  i'd been hoarding it since winning it at the 2002 CIA christmas party. 
we wined and dined on the small tapas-sized dishes, simultaneously licking our lips in praise and racking up a hefty bill.  i never saw the final total. thankfully.  but received some very 'me' gifts from my family. including a new digital camera: kodak, 15 minutes of digital film (yay), 10x zoom, baby;  full manual settings, beautiful alternating screen and viewfinder capability.  love love love it.  the next day-on my actual birthday-we had fun screwing around taking 20 second clips of silly things. among them: pigeons humping, a homeless guy on a bicycle, a closeup of andy's mouth discussing clips, and my brother hanging horizontally from a parking side.  he was re-enacting the night before.  hyped up from the blue cotton candy, jeni, andy, joe, and i raced back. them via grace cathedral, andy and i via the square. upon arriving, breathless, at the corner of jones and washington, joe spies the cable car coming-packed with tourists. so he starts stretching like those muscle men and proceeds to hoist himself, so he's perfectly horizontal from the ground hanging off the parking sign. just as they pass. cheers, whoops and claps came from all the riders, as jeni, andy and i rolled on the pavement laughing, still breathless.  i'm still laughing.

so i turn a year older. 24. gain a job. a new address (nob hill). and a new commute. more on that commute to come.

and whoever is or is not reading this, thanks for making my b-day so splendid. 

and google. here i come."

"event","i can't believe how long it has been since i've written.
work has been exceedingly busy. which is most often the place i write.
unfortunately i have dial-up at home and often dread getting back on the computer after a long day at work. two things which keep me from ever writing at home.

last weekend andy and i spent under the phoenix sun for mike and jen's wedding. he surprised a giants-loving-baseball-fan (me) to not one, but two spring training games. new hats, several $6 beers, and two four hot dogs later we sweated through a vicious row with the brewers in a 7-1 defeat, but came back strong against the cubbies to win 11-3--complete with a rare Jason Schmidt grand slam.

yeah, baby.

the wedding was awesome. i loved every minute, even the sunburn. though andy really had to talk me into it, singing in the church was truly wonderful; i really enjoyed myself and felt so glad to be able to give the gift of song to two wonderful people beginning their life together.

on a golf course, 72 degrees, two open bars and a huge dance floor--we couldn't ask for more at the reception.  it made me even more excited to think about my own brother's upcoming wedding (in august).  though i did get a bit teary when jen danced with her dad, as i thought about pam, and how she has no dad to dance with on her own wedding.  he committed suicide.

my favorite memories are probably of those on the dance floor, where everyone lost inhibition and just went for it.  good times. you can always appreciate doug breaking out all on his own--dance floor to himself. on stage.


we spent the last day trudging around the arizona desert botanical garden. not to be confused with the dessert botanical garden.
despite my earlier comment that 'i hate taking pictures of scenery' i ended up with about twenty shots of various cacti. round golf ball cacti. long, cylindrical cacti. phallic cacti. bulbous cacti. sprawling. snake-like cacti. elephantine prickly cacti. flowery cacti. dr. seuss cacti. sea anemone cacti. 

it was actually quite soothing. something about all those little spikes really set my mind at ease.

...a day late

i spent mine... sleeping in late...downloading and changing the home icons on my computer...procrastinating....sipping a soy latte....finishing the word jumble....lollygagging....huffing up one of the tallest hills in sf...looking geeky across from andy with our matching computers (very geeky)....having a back massage....trying to carry andy into the shower with his clothes on (unsuccessfully)...saying goodbye....driving home....driving...driving....saying hello....watching the oscars...going to bed.

pretty uneventful. really.

so glad LOTR won, though. cleaned house, actually.
i think the aussies are taking over....but there was lots of fun fashion stuff as well. renee's dress was my fav.

"event","SASSYKASSIE: obvious, right? jon's favorite and oft-used name for me. people like to feel like poets or rappers and rhyme.
SASSAFRASS/KASSAFRASS: used sparingly through the years. 
MAMAKASS: i'm not fat. but i share a name (sort of) with the original mama cass of the california-dreamin  mamas and papas. my cousin jeff calls me this.
BUBBLICIOUS: oh, i could write novels on the four month stint living above a 7-11 in $2000/mo two bedroom shithole apartment from which this nickname originated. but, i digress. this one comes from the guy who worked at 7-11. i kid you not.  
we used to go there all the time -- why go all the way to safeway, when 7-11 is your backyard? and who really needs fruit when you can order endless 64 oz. slurpees from your bathroom window?
there were two guys who worked there: one was older and heavier with wandering eyes. the other was college-aged, slim and laid back.  both very nice. after a while, we sort of got to know them and would say hi.
one night  i run down there, decked out for an evening in palo alto hurriedly looking for something: probably smokes.(yes, i smoked in college. socially. didn't everyone? okay, you ND kids probably did not.) this time the older fellow was working. i said hello and smiled. and as i approached the counter, he asks,  'where you goin tonight, bubblicious?'  'palo alto' i say, snickering.
i ran up and told my roommates about it. and kelly says, 'that's nothin kass, he called me 'sugar' the other day.'"

"event","Usually I wake up before she does. She has some trouble sleeping; often I see signs of her predawn ramblings in the kitchen: a still-moist cantaloupe skin, a plate with scone crumbs, apple peelings. 

She never peels apples during the day; only at night. I've never asked why. 

Sometimes she falls asleep with her reading light still on. Sometimes the book is right by her hand, still open. I walk around the bed and turn out the light. Usually she says something; usually I can't understand it. She never remembers later. 

Sometimes, after I've turned out the light, I watch her sleep. I guess we all do, all us mated folks, although we don't talk about it much. We watch the other one sleep. So familiar and so alien, that other; so curious. 

I look at her face, trying to see it for the first time, trying to remember what it looked like before I knew what it looked like. I try to compare it to the face I knew 15 years ago, see how it's aged. 

There's a certain deep wonder: What does she really look like? She has merged so far into my heart that often I'm not sure I could describe her. 

There are times, when I meet her at the airport, that I don't quite recognize her when she gets off the plane. 

It's early as I write this; she's still upstairs asleep. Writing this makes me want to go upstairs and look at her again, but I'm afraid I'll wake her. There was a peach pit in the sink when I came down; I know she was up last night. 

Sometimes, when I look at her sleeping, I wonder if she's dreaming. 

I wonder if I am. I used to watch my children sleep. I think everyone does that. They're easy to sentimentalize when they're asleep; so innocent, so undemanding, so quiet. And lovely, of course -- that thought is, I have been told, hard-wired into our brains; nature has made us believe that all children are lovely, so we will have another reason to protect them. 

When we get older, we get uglier. Nature doesn't want us protected so much. 

And the act of sleeping with someone else in the room is a gesture of trust, a gift. A sleeping child, one thinks, is a child who feels safe. You want your children to feel safe; you're happy when they sleep peacefully. 

Sometimes I watch my now-adult children sleep, on trips or what-not. I know that our relationship is far different now, but in that little moment I can enjoy the luxury of slipping back into the old ways, father watching over child. 

They can decide for themselves where to live and whom to marry; I can still watch them sleep. But mostly, now, I watch her sleep. Sometimes I try to animate her face, like a cartoon. I try to remember her laughing, and then try in my mind to make that face I see on the pillow change into the laughing face I remember. I'm interested in how her muscles work, I guess. 

I'm interested in how her moods animate her. Her face is generally calm when she sleeps, although there are small explosions of emotion: She frowns, sticks out her tongue, mutters, smiles. 

Every time I watch her sleep is another tick of the clock, another drop in the bucket. We have come this far together, I think; we have made it through to this morning still more in love than not, still happy to be in each other's company, still paying attention. 

Like sleep itself, a daily miracle.

"event","""to protect the sanctity of marriage""

can someone in the oval office please define 'sanctity' for me?

oh here, i will: 
1. Holiness of life or disposition; saintliness. 
2. The quality or condition of being considered sacred; inviolability. 
3. Something considered sacred. 

in other words, of or referring to religion. 
now can someone tell me when the government felt the need to dictate religious beliefs to the 'free' people of this country?

mr. president, do you agree that, fundamentally, a marriage is about love?
and do you agree that marriage, to preserve the sanctity of it, is about fidelity and trust?
yes ma'am.
mr. president do you agree that, in essence, the values of love, fidelity and trust are applicable to all people?
yes.
and do you not agree that any kind of person, in this world, any kind of person at all--black, white, muslim, christian, old, young--has the ability to project and honor these values?
yes.
and, mr. president, do you, then, deny that a homosexual person is unable or unfit to  honor these fundamental values?
and why, mr. president do you feel the need to now to bring the church into the law. aren't those supposed to be separate?


it scares me to think that at a time when violence, poverty and rampant disease ravage the world, people are trying to stop other people from exhibiting and promoting love, faith, trust and fidelity."

"event","through  my long, arduous 23 years, i've accumulated many colorful nicknames. the other day i was thinking of them. trying to list them in my head, when i thought it would be fun to compile them all. there is some weird satisfaction in it.  

sticks and stones...

KASS:  the most often used. certain family members. office-mates. hair dressers. friends. it's always interesting to me to discover which personality types end up adopting this one, some of them without even realizing it.
KASSIOPIA: favored by chef bill, at the culinary institute of america.  sounds like the constellation.
KASSOULET (ka-soo-lay): as in the dish.  from the food lovers companion: <i>A classic dish from France's Languedoc region consisting of white beans and various meats, such as sausages, pork and preserved duck or goose. The cassoulet is covered and cooked very slowly to harmonize the flavors.</i>  the nickname was created by diana, one of my managers and (not surprisingly) a chef.
KASS-DAWG, K'FUNK: high school faves. particular to senior year, 'airband' lipsync-ing contests in the gym. we did 'hollywood swingin.'
KASSANDRA: its not my name. never has been. my best friend growing up, Megann, called me that, lovingly. now, the concierge at work calls me Kassandra, too, even though it is not my name and i've never called myself that in his presence.
SUPERKALIFRAGALISTIC: don't even remember.
SPARKLES:invented by don, my former employer of my first real job: papyrus. the card store. i can still hardly go into one and not see 500 i've seen before.  he was a great boss. the nickname stuck around for a while. thankfully, it has gone to rest.
KASIO: as in the stereo.
KRACKIE: college. yep. you won't believe me, it has nothing to do with the obvious (drugs), though my roommates (kelly walsh and nicole tronstad) might try and convince you otherwise 
KUPYKAKES: mom. see. mom was the only one who could get away with this one for a long long time. up until one day my sister decides to open pandora's box,  in front of andy. he grinned for about half an hour and now they are all using it with reckless abandon. 

special section for andy's nicknames:
KLASSIE, KRASSIE, CHASSIE, CHASTITY...mostly re-incarnations of a random drunk guy misinterpreting my name at a wedding; andy happened to hear.

so....folks....what are yours?"

LONDON - Despite advice from Outkast's Andre 3000 in the never-played hit song ""Hey Ya"", Polaroid warns against shaking of its pictures for quicker development. Not only does shaking it not develop the film faster, it can cause harm to the photos in the form of 'blobs', when chemicals in the film mix prematurely.

News of this, combined with concerns from officials that people will ""straight up do whatever rappers and MCs tell them to"", the music industry made a statement this morning: ""please, people, don't do what these musicians say. It's just not safe."" - Fearing it wasn't enough, they later gave specific examples of lyrics that should NOT be acted out once heard.

According to the music industry, DO NOT: 
""Grab it like you want it.""
""Party like it's your birthday""
""Party like it's 1999""
""Roll with the G Funk, bumpin in my s**t and it don't quit""
""Get it goin' like a turbo 'Vette""
""Walk around grabbin your you-know-what, Flippin the you-know-who"" 

The moral of the story is, you can't believe everything you hear in songs. Stick to the news instead, it's much more trustworthy.""

"event","i take a windy, picturesque road to work. its the same road all the tourists take to gawk at the grapes and the wineries and the pretty candy-colored hot air balloons.
on my way to work this morning, i saw three innocent, sweet creatures all killed by the traffic that whooshes through daily (and nightly) like freight trains.
first, a rabbit. but this didn't look wild. it was fluffy, white, and soft. like someone's pet.  i could imagine a little girl searching for floppy only to have mommy stroking her head, saying, honey, he's off to a better place now.
then, a cat. a little one. and being a cat lover myself. and having not long ago buried mine of 19 years. i started to cry. again. the little girl image popped into my mind. then my cat. deep breath.
finally, just before turning onto pratt avenue, a narrow crossroad that takes me to the tunnel of oak  trees, i spotted a tinier, grey, bushy-tailed squirrel. clarise. the squirrels who prance around in my parents walnut trees teasing augie (the dog). sad. sad. so much death on the road this morning. i've never hit an animal. except bugs.  i wonder how many people don't even care...don't give it a second thought.

....

speaking of bushy tails...
chip and dale's adventure with donald duck and the apple orchard was hands-down favorite cartoon growing up. i must have watched it over 150 times. often, several times in one day.   in fact, i'd love to watch it right now. i can still picture them, scampering around the orchard, dropping apples all over poor donald duck and snickering about it in the trees. i wonder, do chipmunks really eat apples? do orchard owners vehemently hate them? and do the chipmunks always win?"

i thought it would be a nice surprise.  unexpected. i can see her arriving home from work, exasperated, after having told countless amateur valentiners, 'there is not one (god damn) reservation in the city. not one. i cannot help you. i'm truly sorry. hiking up nob hill in some godforsaken orange stilettos, pondering a lavish cocktail at The Big Four. possibly feeling a little lovelorn.  as nearly all women cannot help feeling (though we try mightily) when finding ourselves sans-date on the big v day. even if it is a hallmark holiday.   we used to call it single-awareness day. an apropos name.
it will be dark, or dusk, perhaps. and she'll come up the stairs. trudge into her apartment and there...centered on the low glass coffee table. a sparkling bouquet, reflecting all of it's joy, all over the room.
a warm heart. a fleeting hope.   and on opening the card, some distant romantic notion will flutter away, replaced by familial sentimentality, as she reads: happy valentine's day Jeni, love your little sister.

Doggy is good, no new pictures, it's snowing outside, life is good. Peace."

He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun.

On the shore lay montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wondered
With the secrets of the worlds.

And his subjects gathered round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see.

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on.

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones.

They carried them to the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up with their bare hands
What we still cant do today.

And I know shes living there
And she loves me to this day
I still cant remember when
Or how I lost my way.

He came dancing across the water
Cortez, cortez
What a killer.

Walking through the desert
You know what it's about
It's really from the church
Too foreign
That was never there
Yet you know I'm in heaven
But it is a hell
Sun is drying up my brain
The smile and installations
Are my pain
I'm going mad
I'm going mad
I'm going mad
Aaaayowwww!!!"

"event","Tekfox and I had a discussion about this last night. I couldn't find this at the time, but I thought this was a good analogy regarding illegal immigrants in our country.

--------

A lady wrote the best letter in the Editorials in ages! It explains things better than all the baloney you hear on TV.

Recently large demonstrations have taken place across the country protesting the fact that Congress is finally addressing the issue of illegal immigration. Certain people are angry that the US might protect its own borders, might make it harder to sneak into this country and, once  here,to stay indefinitely. Let me see if I correctly understand the thinking behind these protests. 

Let's say I break into your house. Let's say that when you discover me in your house, you insist that I leave. But I say, ""I've made all the beds and washed the dishes and did the laundry and swept the floors; I've done all the things you don't like to do. I'm hard-working and honest (except for when I broke into your house).""

According to the protesters, not only must you let me stay, you must add me to your family's insurance plan, educate my kids, and provide other benefits to me and to my family (my husband will do your yard work because he too is hard-working and honest, except for that breaking in part). If you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my friends who will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my right to be there. It's only fair, after all, because you have a nicer house than I do, and I'm just trying to better myself. I'm hard-working and honest, um, except for well, you know. 

 And what a deal it is for me!! I live in your house, contributing only a fraction of the cost of my keep, and there is nothing you can do about it without being accused of selfishness, prejudice and being an anti-housebreaker. Oh yeah, and I want you to learn my language so you can communicate with me.

An estimated <b>15 billion</b> American dollars every 3 months are sent to Mexico by an estimated 18 million immigrants who illegally work in the United States.


Why can't people see how ridiculous this is?! Only in America...."

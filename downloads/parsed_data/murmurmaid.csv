"event","everything is good.  i have confidence.  i have a new yoga shirt from old navy and also some camoflauge cargo pants.  it makes me look very bull dykish.  i think thats my style.  im a drill seargent.  

i want to talk about all the good things that i felt today but now really all i feel like saying is that this house overwhelms me with its fleas and filth and dirt.  i want to avoid it but i cant.  i need to figure something out, and fast, because this house really ruins my mood.  

i dont have the time i want to clean this shit up.  bleh i just want to go lay in bed now and pass out on melatonins because there are fleas all over me.

tomorrow there will be talk of pharmacutical companies and their deciet, and confidence in dikey clothes, and lots of dark tower.  but right now, i cant handle the fleas.  i think im going to have to fess up to mom that i cant handle it, and i may need her help.

life is good.  i realy love beth.

oh shit i totally forgot that i wanted to brag about my offer to be flown (flied?  flew?) to any market in the country that i wish to be a ""powwr pusher"" for friedman marketing.  that means i get put up in a hotel and i get 50 dollars a day for ""food"", all i have to do is go to a mall and do my job and get a lot of surveys for a company.  so, lesbian life partner, we need to do some research into what cities my job is in so we can meet up and have a hotel thing.  sarah i think there might be a market in baltimore too, lets talk about it!"

"event","i should update more.  i say that a lot.  things have been great.  i have leveled up 5 times  i think.  its really cool.  the possibilities are endless.  i have found my rhythm and my confidence and my will.  i talked to mom about the past and it was good because we were able to just acknowledge things instead of playing blame games, but then my sister called and probed me for information and there was a lot of hostility and defensiveness because thats just how things turned out.  she told me that she thought i was jealous because she turned out fine and i didnt.  she also told me there are only 2 problems she has with me, i do drugs and im messy and im costing mom a bunch of money.  my response was that my only problem with her is that she is too critical and judgemental to evaluate things and see whats really going on.  i didnt try to defend myself i just told her that it wasnt any of her business.  its hard to comnicate with jodi.  she told me that in first grade she was jealous that i got all the attention in school and she made up her mind then to be better than me.  i needed to hear that.  not so i could blame everything on her but so i could trace things back and be able to fix things.  i want to stop a pattern.  i want to not fuck our kids up.  i could really care less if jodi ever likes me but i wish she could at least learn to love herself.  jodi would say that she is confident in her life and she has this that and the other going for her, but i want her to understand how to communicate with people.  thats all.

i hope maybe my mom will read my livejournal more now and maybe ever reply to it.  i also want my mom and paddys mom to talk online maybe and get to know each other.  i think they would make really good friends.  theyre both cute and smart and interesting and interested in their children.  i love mommies and families.

ok i also have to talk about work.  im doing a good job running around training people and getting my surveys and doing whatever else i can to help move things along.  i really enjoy my job but i do let it stress me out too much.  im learning to deal with everything better though.  it just keeps getting easier.  

me and paddy have finally had a good talk too, about my concerns about getting married.  ive been feeling really scared about getting married because i am growing up so fast and realizing things and i dont want anything to hold me back from what im supposed to do, and things have been bothering me a lot like the fact that everyone in the world is always telling me that im going to bring paddy down or hold him back or whatever, because im obviously the dominant one.  ive let myself believe this whole time, my whole life, that i shouldnt be so bossy and whatever, but its just who i am.  im tired of trying to change to suit people.  i wanted to know that if paddy wanted to be with me it was because he was my friend and because he wanted to be there, not because i was dragging him along.  paddy tells me that what he wants is to be with me, so im just going to believe it now, and do my thing, and have faith that its right and stop listenng to other people.  i do love paddy more than anything.  he has been there for me through everything and he has been the only person that supported me completely no matter what and made me realize that i am worth something.  now its time to grow up and do things and be things.

i want to say also that im DONE with the drama.  dreads and rancid, you guys are not my friends, you can read and post on my journal if you want but your comments will just be deleted.  unless you want to apologize for something.  ny journal is an open book it always was ans always will be.  you arent going to ruin it.

PS:  im reading the dark tower series and i have too many thoughts to explain.  katie must write more.  katie must sing more.   katie must draw more.  katie must be katie more.  katie is ready to be katie now.

2006 and im 26 and it all equals 8 and aint that great w00t 11:11 :-!"

"event","someone told me that if i had sex with my brother that someone would die.  i think that freddy krueger told me that.  but my brother was hot and i let him pick me up and set me on his cock but it wouldnt quite go in no matter how we moved it.  he had dark hair and a baseball cap and a condom on.  he had big beefy arms and he made me incredibly aroused even though the whole time i thought in the back of my head i was killing someone with this fuck.

then my brother tried to kill me with weapons and i ran away and in this world it was possible to run a certain speed and touch water and warp into another dimension where things were exactly the same except that it was another dimension.  i warped and fell into a warehouse where dozens of people were tied up, including my dream sisters.  one was completely insane and bound, the other was suffering from unknown injuries.  i had been shot in the ankle by a shotgun while warping.  i was tied up.  

rich people came into the warehouse and admired us as though we were cuts of beef at a supermarket.  i realized i was dreaming and i space bounced out of my ties onto a shelf on the opposite wall, and made an announcement to the room that they were figments of my imagination, and that i was leaving this place and they couldnt do anything about it.  they whispered among themselves and unanimously agreed that they were, in fact, not real.  i seized the opportunity and escaped onto a dark street that im pretty sure is my grandmothers street.  the atmosphere was ominous.  thunder and lightening in the distance, fog, drizzle, the feeling of being chased.  i still knew i was dreaming but i knew id forget soon.  i thought i better go into the closest house and quick before whoever was chasing me saw me.

the closest house was predictably a vampire estate, but i figured that might make for an interesting dream once i forgot that i was dreaming, so i turned in.  once inside, i made use of my lucid state by commanding the vampire women to have lesbian sex with me.  it was very enjoyable, untl i got too into it and lost my lucid state, and was bitten by a vampire.  then i did some tricks with hollograms and dissapeared behind some florescent pyramids.

next night

i am the guy from king of queens and im staring in the movie ""are we there yet"", except i was the main character instead of ice cube, and we were on planes, not in a van.

there is a lot of waiting for planes to take off and looking for tickets.  me and my sidekicks, two young african american children, went for a walk outside the plane and ended up in nature.  i fell into a pond where a talking plant lived.  he was lonely and hypnotized me and turned me into a plant, and i became his plant wife for a moment.  we talked in high pitched voices and i told him i was marge simpson.  then i saw my sidekicks floating out of the pond down a river so i escaped my plant form and followed after them.  the plant creature was angry and tried to kill me but i escaped.  

back on the plane which was now a train waiting to leave the station, a man asked me if i found the magic flower while i wan in my plant form, and i said no, but then i looked in my hat and saw a flower.  i showd it to the man and he screamed ""where is the stamen!  we have to find the stamen!"" so i went back and became a plant wife again.  this time i barely escaped with my life, and the stamen, because the plant man was pissed.  he turned into an evil clown when i grabbed his stamen, and almost ate me alive."

"event","im trying too hard to be strong and overcome shit instead of dealing with shit.  tody i cried so much my eyes are swollen and i have a headache.  sometimes my life is crappy.  stop trying to fix everything and breathe.  i need some fucking friends.  im going to make some.  im realy stressed out, can you tell?  you want details?  ok.  kris doesnt want to live with me or even stay home long enough to get a package i sent him, he decided to go play in a music festival instead, which is really cool for him i just wish hed fucking talked to me first since we are friends and shit.  i wish i could go play in a music festival, unfortunately i cant play and instruments because i dont have any friends that are into music or a car to go see music or the money to fucking pay for a teacher or the drive to even give a shit.  i wish my mother would look at my live journal.  im jealous of paddy because his mother has her own live journal and reads and comments on both of ours.  i have tried to give my mom things to read that i wrote a billion times and she wont pay any fucking attention to me.  i love my mom and want to spend tome with her.  but its like she decided to have me, fuck me up, and then support me financially forever while telling me how she feels she owes it to me for fucking me up, when ALL I EVER NEEDED WAS HER EMOTIONAL SUPPORT!  i feel so embarassed when i think of the ways i acted when i was younger.  the ways i tried to get attention.  i dont want to do them anymore.  thats why i try not to bitch and moan in this fucking journal anymore.  lolol so no one has anything to criticize me about like i got my whole fucking life.  well criticize me all you want.  everyone.  dreads, rancid, random internet stranger, even scott and danielle.  your all righ. i am a fucked up individual.  i rely on drugs to escape from reality.  i surround myself with people who praise me because i have a low self esteem and i feel the need to be in control.  but do you people really want to know why i feel those ways?  its because i had a fucked up life, just like you, and im trying to peice it together now without appearing weak, like a victim.  i was raised by 2 people who loved me very much but didnt get along.  my dad was emotionally abusive to my mother and me and my sister.  sometimes he was physically abusive.  i always want to defend him and say he couldnt help it.  but he could have helped some of it.  so could my mom.  she could have used all that fucking money they made to put her talented daughters in some fucking art classes, singing lessons, baseball, whateevr the fuck we wanted to do because we were like really smart and creative and talented kids.  instead we got to sit and watch my dad smoke pot and yell at my mom, and my mom cook dinner and look at herself in the mirror and call herself fat.  and we got to play with lots of little toys that matched perfectly so everything was fair anmd we were always equal and no one felt left out, even though thats incredibly unrealistic because we were fraternal twins and thought in completely diffeent ways.  so what happened was we were always competing and of course one of us became the leader and that was my sister.  she alwys told me what to do and i was cool with that because i loved her.  but it sucked sometimes.  then it got to the point where every time we made a friend it turned into a battle of who do you like better.  we should have been more seperated and had our own friends.  she pretty much just walked all over me and made me feel like less of a person my whole life.  of course i try to fill the holes in with a lot of penises, maybe because i needed a male figure in my life because my father died, maybe because i was lonely and needed love.  maybe i was just a horny girl.  but i just completely fucked myself over by fucking any guy that would touch me and taking any kind of drug i could get my hands on just so i could alter things a little.  BECAUSE MY LiFE JUST ALWAYS SUCKED!  and now im old enough to realize all of this and its hard because i have to rearrange everything and act like a grown up.  i love my mom and i know that sh was a victim of life too and i want more than anything to just give her a million dollars so she can do everything she wants to do.  shes spent her whole life taking care of other people and i think i need to stop trying to do that too.  we both should take care of ourselves.  k this is way off topic now.  goodnight."

me and paddy are doing excellent.  life is going good.  im learning shit.  the usual lol.  i should probably go into more detail about what im learning but im stiull kind of recovering from my audience giving me such a nasty reaction lately.  i could use more positive feedback.  im going to start commenting more in my friends journals too maybe we can get a better flow going.

im sad because my friend is second guessing moving in with me because he isnt sure it will work out.  thats kind of a pessimistic way to be but i know i shouldnt rush or push too much.  understanding is important.  i think i can come up with the money to have him visit anyway, or me visit him, and maybe things will be so amazing that he has to move in.  

its hard to be patient when you want something really bad.  i love my friends and want them near me.  i am stupid and i always bring the wrong people into my home because i want my commune dream to be fulfilled and the people i really want in my commune have other things right now.  its kind of depressing but its ok i can deal with the internet right now.  i dont want to forever though.  im being gloomy i should talk about happy things.

like how im inspired a lot lately and want to be very creative.  now i should go be creative."

last night me and paddy found the two of cups.  its bizarre realizing youve been lying to yourself for such a long period of time.  excuses suck especially when you dont know your making them.  wow a whole year this time.  paddy we have to remember why we chose each other.  we arent sisters.  i love you more than anything and i love being able to watch you grow.  i love that you help me grow.  i am the luckiest.

the dextroverse is cool.  its also helped me grow.  the cool people water me and the assholes prune me.  i appriciate everyone for all their hard work.  i also look forward to karma returning the favor for them, whether it be tourque coming onto a fortune or even on of those people (trying hard not to mention names lol) that have projected their own insecurites on to me to catch a dose of their own medicine.  

karma is real and so is god and so is complete silence.  learn to express using words without spewing verbal diahreah.  lern to express with body and voice without flailing arms and volume. learn to express using energy without asking yourself what kind of energy you really need to be using.  most importantly be patient with yourself.  take care of your body and mind and heart and soul, even if no one else things your worth it.  you are.  rememeber these things katie.  

things are rough today but good.  i have to not push others so hard .  i need to be patient with others too.  i want things to happen to match my dreams but i cant force dreams to come true.  i want peopl ein my life that i love but sometimes the people i love dont feel the same way about love or me or plans or whatever.  thats cool too.  maybe it wasnt supposed to work out.  i hope it works out.  im ok if it doesnt.

today is an alone day, first in a long time.  been working hard and playing hard.  my skins breaking out a bit and im losing weight.  i need to take it easier and im going to.  

lol sometimes i dont realize how stressed out i actually am until im crashing.  luckily i caught myself just in time.  a bit depressed but only because of a slight crash, and not because life sucks.  

im excited about life.

shoutout to the pathie for wanting the same things.  it will be cool when cool people want to follow the pathie but i like us too and i can wait.  i love you guys and thanks for always being close by and... i just lvoe you and want to tell you 100 more times but you get it. <3"

ok and NOW im going to share something written by someone who is really cool whos opinions matter to me. props to real friends for being supportive and mostly proppes to tourque for being the coolest 57 year old sax playing hippie to ever exist <3

<b>ruminations about the drug culture, by tourque


Always hesitant to avoid any appearance of self-promotion, I try not to make too many personal posts, preferring for the most part discussions of ideas and theories. But, with nearly a year on this site and now making my one thousandth post, I'd like to share some thoughts about the DV, its purpose and its people, and my four decades of experience in the drug culture.

Everyone is probably sick of hearing about the fucking Sixties (and the fucking ""Baby-Boomers"") but certainly there were things which began unfolding back then which have led to the drug culture of today. Remember, prior to the Psychedelic Revolution, drug use was outre, the province of ghetto residents, beatniks, and (gasp!) jazz musicians. Now, of course, we all know that respectable types were enjoying their prescription diet pills and sleep aids, but that was a private matter, not to be shared or celebrated in an era of martinis and cigarettes. But the emerging awareness of LSD in polite society, coupled with the social upheavals of the civil rights struggle, free speech movement, and opposition to the Vietnam war a bit later, set the stage for an entirely new sort of drug culture. It was one thing to drop out of society -- a completely different thing to form a new one alongside the old. 

Those were heady times when, for a while, we really thought we were going to overturn the system. The cornpone culture of the day simply evaporated when subjected to prolonged observation while stoned. It just seemed so logical, get everyone high and we could solve all the problems of the world. And it was so much fun to listen to the sputtering, red-faced, totally uncomprehending moralists freaking out about bell-bottom pants, hippie beads, and ""Free Love"". It was so easy to get a rise out of those idiots -- it still is today -- but at the time it felt like a whole collective adolescent rebellion against a domineering and out-of-touch collective father. It was like the countless little dramas which occurred in individual families was playing out in the society at large. We were asking ""Why?"" and they responded. ""Because."" But when they asked ""Why"" we responded ""Why not?"". 

Of course, as we know, the outwardly revolutionary aspect of the movement sort of fizzled out for a number of reasons. The main one being, I believe, the fractious and perfidious aspects of human nature itself. Get an asshole stoned and guess what -- he's still an asshole. And the larger culture began to see the movement as a way to make a fucking buck -- the symbols of the drug culture were co-opted by Madison Avenue, Haight Street became a part of Main Street. The music which had once been ours exclusively was repackaged and watered down for general consumption, the language we shared was picked up by the media and effectively neutered when used (often awkwardly) by authority figures, fashion creeps, and squares. Straight culture breathed a sigh of relief, dressed itself in polyester and went disco dancing -- the retrenchment was completed with the election of Ronald Reagan. The remnants of 60's High Culture were scattered around like pieces of paper from a dumped trash can in a windy alley.

One day, a little less than a year ago, I decided to do a little research into dxm extractions and wandered into the DV. And as I got to know this place better I got this strange sense akin to deja vu -- wow, here were the dex heads which my generation unleashed upon the world! Here, forty years later, people were talking about Robowalking, dxm dicklessness, the fine points of puking in public, the existence of ""entities"". But, along with the nostalgia, there was something else -- at least among some -- a real thirst for knowledge, a wealth of information on brain chemistry, and a host of shared concerns over addiction and health matters. This simply didn't exist back in my dorm room, decorated with empty Romilar bottles, Peter Max posters, and a lava lamp at NYU! 

I had thought of naming some specific individuals who, to me, represent the best of the psychedelic spirit or whatever we wish to call it. Right away I think of ohm and floatingleaf, the only DV'ers I've met in real life -- and how lucky that was because they are the best, the real thing. There are also a bunch of guys here with whom I feel a real fellowship -- Strange Religion, SolitaireZeta, Ben Flex, Ghinder (I was truly touched by his ""grasshopper"" comment), MadameBovary, itimmy -- oh hell, I can't name everyone, I shouldn't have even started. There are a lot of really fantastic females on this board but with the age difference I think it would be unseemly of me to single any out -- you're all beautiful to me and very fancy. But I'm going to make one exception -- MURMURMAID is a true incarnation of the ""spirit"". Tolerant, curious, honest, loving, artistically and musically talented -- I simply feel a profound ethereal connection with this woman, who I'd be proud to call my daughter! And, if Katie represents the heart of the psychedelic spirit, Walkaway represents the head. His encyclopaedic knowledge, his skill with words, his disciplined approach to all manner of chemical experimentation -- we've argued on occasion but I needn't say more. I'll let Montaigne say it for me:

Rivalry, competitiveness and glory will drive me and raise me above my own level.... Our mind is strengthened by contact with vigorous and well-ordered minds.""</i>

So, a thousand posts, and this one's way too long. I feel bad that I can't thank you all individually but it would just end up a big list of names, and I'd still accidentally leave some people out! Keep posting, friends, and if you can spare it, why not send a little donation to help keep this site going strong; this is a great place, help it stay that way. </b>"

"event","last night was intense.  

so we are getting a new roommate.  he is a musician and he inspires me a lot and im very excited to work with him and also to be good friends with him.  im also excited to get some new blood in the house.  me and paddy both need it.  so far its going really well because it kind of pushed some stuff out in the open with me and paddy about ways we were both feeling, and how we werent nuirturing each other like we should.  

last night i had a flip out after a big talk happened because i told paddy i hgad been freaking out about legal marriage and i kept making all these excuses why and he kept questioning me and i finally realized why i was so scared and pulling away from it.  ive never dealt with what i went through when my parents got divorced.  i never really got over coming from a dysfunctional broken home.  its like i thought i had already forgiven everyone and i like didnt want to be a vioctim.  its hard to be so strong.  like i needed to let myself say outloud that im pissed that my mom used to cry about being treated like shit by my dad in front of me.  im pissed that i had to observe all the silent tension in the house.  im pissed that i always feel like making sure everyone knows that IT WASNT MY DADDYS FAULT THAT HE WAS EMOPTIONALLY, VERBALLY AND SOMEWHAT PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE BECAUSE HE HAD A BRAIN TUMOR.  which is the truth, and i do love my dad and miss him.  but look see im doing that thing again where i say it wasnt THAT bad, my daddy loved me.  no im pissed that i had to be held up to a wall by my throat because my dad found a note i wrote to a friend about snaking out of the house when i was 9.  im pissed that we couldnt ever have family dinners and laugh and have a good time without my dad losing his temper and hitting me in the back of the head and my mom running us to mcdonalds to make us happy and forget about things ehich caused me to over eat my whole life.

im also pissed that i ha to watvh my mom be so fucking critical of herself about things like her body because it really fucked me and my sister up.  and then finally im pissed that my sister dealt with her own insecurities by making fun of every little fucking thing i ever did and said so now im dealing with all these bad programs by not being my self.

what i mean is that im a natural performer, im multi talented, loud, big personality, NICE, bossy, creative, and intelligent, and i was bever ever fucking allowed to be confident about those things long enough to make use of them.  i have tried to completely change my personality just to make sure my ego is in check.  i havent been able to find my singing style, drawing style, personal style, becauyse anything not normal was pointed out and laughed at by by sister and also my mom.  i realize now that people probably criticize me for things im good at because THEY ARE JEALOUS and i cant believe its taken me this long to realize it.  im pissed that no one ever put me in art or music classes.  im pissed im pissed im pissed!

now with all that said, maybe now i can finally really forgive everyone involved in my shitty childhood and start really recovering from it so i can stop giving my family a hard time.  i never knew why i acted in such ways.  like when i was young i had no idea how to get any fucking attention except for tp cut myself or threaten suicide.  i needed help so badly because i was depressed and lonely and hurt and i never had any real friends or support.  sometimes i wish my mom would jkust be like IM SORRY I WASNT THE BEST MOTHER IN THE WORLD I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER AND I LOVE YOU AND IM PROUD OF YOU instead of acting all timid and scared and ashamed when i try to talk about my childhood with her and she just like makes me feel guilty for shit.  i want her to get pissed at the ways she was raised that made her feel like she needed to marry a man that treatd her like shit and never be able to leave him.  i want to bond with my mother and grow in ways together but i think i might just have to deal with the fact that she might not ever recognize these patterns that led up to everyone acting the ways they act but what i CAN do is learn from all these negative patterns and give myself some fucking credit, and go be my fucking awesome self and stop trying to prove my self worth to other pwoplw.  like ive always needed praise and assurance from othr people so i could feel any sense of self worth,  i just dont need it anymore.  i want a tattoo on my hand of a lion to remind me that im a LEO and to have my big shiny mane and be my charming witty creative self but never try to impress anyone with it because i dont give a fuck if mister joe shmoe notices my shiny mane.  i need to let people impress me not the other way around,  i already know im the shit.  lol this is why i wantes people like rancid and zeph to live with me and know that i really am a nice person.  like why the fuck would i care if people like that think im the anti christ?  they dont deserve my kindness.  lol of course that doesnt mean that i dont still care about those people, but im also just kind of pissed that i fucking put up with all that garbage.

ok rant is over.  things are good.  i am looking foraward to my future."

the haps:

work has SUCKED!  we havent had any work in awhile so paddy is down to 0 hours and i think i worked like 8 hours in two weeks.  im back on track now and we both have raises, but it just sucks.  also the other day at work i had a really bad day that consisted of my pregant friend shanna (blond haired blue shirted chick i posted in my journal awhile back that i hooked up with her boyfriend) accusing me of trying to steal surveys from her in a really mean loud manner in front of everyone we work with and respondants.  i was like wtf'ing her and then i cried because she was like pointing her finger at me and saying malicious hurtful things and it was so out of the blue.  ive been put off with her for awhile now because she totally uses people, she also says some fucked up shit sometimes, ie:  ""gay men are fucked up and sick"" even though she has lesbian sex.  but shes never been mean to me directly (just indirectly lol) so i thought we were ok.  everyone keeps saying ""well shes pregant"" and i want to slap everyone who said that for not knowing shit.  shanna was like this before she was pregnant.  i think maybe shes just a bitch?  maybe shes just feeling guilty because shes smoked weed every day since shes been pregnant and shes taking it out on me?  bleh now im being bitchy, but that was really messed up.  i acted like a huge crybaby, and so what, i AM a crybaby, especially when my friend turns on me, especially in that kind of way.  i told my boss i wouldnt work with her anymore and she said that was a good idea.  oh but im working with her all weekend.  yesterday i was so anxious going to work i almost cried/puked/quit my job.  paddy was very good and helped me feel better enough to stand up and go into the office.  it took about an hour fo rmy stomach to un-knot.  lol then shanna started talking me like NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.  i was so confused and wanted to ignore the bitch but i tried to be mature and nice.  it worked.  i just had to remind myself that i didnt have to be her friend still.  psh friend.  i throw that word around because i dont know what else to use for the people i hang out with that live in douglasville georgia (michael excluded of course).  fuck this town, seriously.  i never realized how gross and racist and sexist and greedy and just yuck this town was.  its not for me.  i want to get the fuck out.  TOO BAD MY FRIEND OF 4 YEARS KHALID WAS GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND ABOUT THAT CAR HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GET FOR US.  OMG I <3 MY FRIENDS!

k im not really in a bad mood but im putting myself in one.  happy things have happened too.  i got my bedroom cleaned up and arranged and i have my own cozy little nest where i can lock myself up and have alone time if i need it.  me and paddy are working on communicating better.  were planning our wedding

<BIG><B> BTW THE WEDDING IS JUNE 25TH, WE HAD TO CHANGE THE DATE BECAUSE OF CONFLICTS, BUT THATS THE OFFICIAL DATE NOW</big><b/>

weddings.  its stressing me out but im excited.

i had a dream 2 nights ago about logan.  oh he sent me a letter from jail the other day and he seems to be doing good and wants me to visit and that makes me happy.  zeph was also in my dream.  he came over and he was really fucked on cough meds and he was like ""DUUUUDES, OMG, IM BACK GUYS!"" and hugged people and almost fell down a lot and it reminded me of the time he tried to call me recently after he dissapeard for like 6 months, but he was so fucked up on cough meds i couldnt even understand his message and i was glad he was safe but i couldnt bring myself to talk to him that fucked up for the same reasons i didnt want to be around him when he was that fucked up in my house.  im glad hes ok though.  maybe he can write in his journal sometimes and we can reestablish a friendship sometime, one that doesnt have anything to do with cough meds.  oh also in my dream were a wild cat and a wild baboon that wanted to eat me.  i dream about the wild cat a lot, he never bites me oir anything he just growls and looks ready to pounce and im frozen with fear.  i have a pretty good idea what this particular dream means to me.  the house the dream took place at is my grandmothers, which seems to represent my subconcious a lot.  i was in the basement and i kept trying to keep the door locked that leads outside because there was a wild baboon and cat out there that looked hungry, but they like came through a doggy door anyway and i tried to cover up with a blanket and pretend they werent there but i could hear them snarling and running around out there.  i think they are some personal demons that i have tried to avoid working out in hopes they will just go away.  i cant hide from problems.  

last night i dreamed about beth.  she and her friend who was the gay guy on the realworld key west came to get us and took us to va.  when i saw beth in the mall next to a bookstore i pounced on her and covered her with kisses and hugs and she seemed really annoyed.  i think we both had babies.  she seemed somewhat aloof towards me throughout the whole dream.  she kept holding paddys hand and telling him how great he was.  i was jealous but i tried not to be because i love beth and paddy.  she ignored me a lot and kept to her side of the house.  i had no money or anything and couldnt get to work.  near the end it was raining and i knew i had to get to work by 1:00 so i told paddy to get dressed and meet me outside so we could walk really fast to work cause it was like a billion miles.  i ran out of the building parking lot and waited but he didnt come so i got pissed off and ran back.  it was so cool to run i was going to fast and i could do awesome long jumps over speedbumps and shit and hover a lot.  i felt liek a cheetah.  then paddy came running towards me jumping the same way.  he was wearing some ugly boxers and a buttton down shirt that was unbuttoned.  he also had a half-chubb.  and tennis shoes.  and a tattoo of a loony tunes character on his stomach.  then we had a fight and i woke up.

its cool that ive remembered my last couple of dreams.  im planning on not smoking weed for a good while until i can afford it, and definitely after i lose some more weight, i have put like 3 lbs out of that 20 i lost back on.

oh btw the witches brew didnt work, maybe we puked it up or something.  if i ever drink amazonian bark/root brews again i think ill go to the amazon and let a shaman serve it to me.

ok did anything else happen?  PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE LIFE IS MAX BORING."

i havent written in here for awhile cause i was too busy haveing a real life.  a quick update on the dmx situation so i can get that out of the way and go on to better subject matters.  the juicy bits are going to strt about halfway down if you want to skip there.  (and if you arent on my friends list you dont get the juicy details, so if you are a friend you should log in)

ok so im embarrassed that i freaked out about dxm on dxm again but that happens like clockwork every once in awhile and its usually just a dxm delusion.  what happened this time is that i was on dxm and read a bodhisattva vow on the internet and felt passionately about doing my best to follow the vow and then i read some thing at the bottom of the page about how bodhisattvas should abstain from anything that might cloud their judgement or make them make the wrong decisions and stuff.  like drugs and alcohol ect... so i got really flipped out and caused a scene and then when i was sober the next day i remembered that i wasnt a buddhist and had no intention of becoming a buddhist or a hindu or a christian or anything else because i already know what i believe and its like a mixture of many different ideas and some of my own made up ones.  yes its true that i relate muchly to following a bodhisattva path but i really only use that term because it explained that path a lot better than i ever heard it explained in any christian literature.  its pretty much just like being christlike.  jesus is my role model and my homeboy and easier to relate to than other bodhisattvas because im a westerner i guess.  either way i also remembered once i was sober that its much harder being christlike when im not able to enjoy dxm because not enjoying dxm makes me kind of indifferent and anxious.  besides, i realized that i was jesus while on dxm several years back so i gotta pay homage.  so the facts are now that i take back wanting to stop doing dxm and that ill probably flip out about it again sometime but my plan is to just stop relying on it so much and taking more breaks to clear my mind and all that jazz."

"event","hello internet.  i have to work really early today and wear fancy clothes to impress some clients even though i dont even remember what feild job im doing today exactly.  right now i feel calm.  ive gone 3 days without dxm and hope to not do it today.  ive said from the beginning that i wasnt ready to stop until i had at least 2 whole weeks of nothing important to do to really stick with it.  work is pretty much the only reason my plans havent worked out in the past.  well, that job anyway.  its too stressful.  i have a tiny bit of dxm today to have in my purse for comfort probably but if it starts getting rough imma take them.  either way im doing really good.  all except the eating everything and being lazy.  having a sex drive back suddenly and violently is... weird?  kind of cool but a little too intense lol.  basicly i want to get laid a lot.

yesterday we went to the gym early and worked out for a couple hours.  my arms are so sore today but thats cool.  whats not cool is going straight to an asian buffet afterwards and eating sushi and shrimp and greenbeans and whatever else yumminess they had up there, until i almost popped, then coming home and eating 2 cans of sardines, a microwave dinner, and half a gallon of icecream.  if i have to choose between sloth and gluttony and dxm im going back to the dxm. :(.  id rather be medicated with medicine than food.  

theres a random picture of an ass on paddys computer screen.

havent seen logan and lee for awhile.  that might be a good thing it was getting to intense.  i needed to distance myself for a bit.  michael came over and we painted the other day.  i painted a fairy with pretty opaque wings.  the wings are painted with water color and the rest is gonna be acrylics whenever i finish it.  it inspired me to do more art so i bought some canvases and paint and more drawing pencils.  during my time off there will be much art made.

k i have to poop and put on makeup.

kelly if you see this, i got your message about the gym pretty late and we had already went during the day.  i would love to go with you another day though if you want to.  <3"

"event","hello.

yesterday sucked.  today i feel like i thought i would 2 days ago when i freaked out about dxm.  like i dont care wnough to really stop.  its easy to care when your on dxm because your... not not on dxm.  lol.

it would help if i just had a friend to lean on or something.  not that paddy or michael arent friends, but i never see michael and paddy seems unable to work with me because i guess i piss him off or something with my moodiness.  by the time i realize im being moody in a bad way i try to apologize but by then hes like all numb and doesnt care or something and then im crying and feeling self destructive.  yesterday was only day one and there was already a big fucking stupid hurtful incident that made me feel like i dont care anymore.  it seems like being on dxm every second of my life would be easier than trying to make it through any amount of time without it because of the way it affects me emotionally.  i just feel incredibly depressed and i cant even talk about it because i never say anything right and i cause fights.  plus, it doesnt help to feel self destructive and depressed and be told things like ""i think your just being negative"" or "" i dont see why its such a big deal"".

i really want to want to care about this but i dont think im going to.  maybe if i wasnt so fucking depressed i would care a little more, but the things i need to help me not be depressed are not happening.

i am not saying im giving up already, but im saying i probably will if things keep going like this.  the main reason i didnt stop doing dxm before is because dxm motivates me to get shit done and sobriety makes me feel depressed and irritable and the dxm way seems to be a lot easier on other people.  so far on my first day i freaked out at work and my boss told me how she was going out on a limb for me to get me a raise and blah blah and how could i ask for time of now.  i guess she wants me to just keep being on drugs at work?  and then ive got paddy at home making it completely obvious how bad my situation is making him feel.  i feel like extremely self destructive right now.  the really bad kind where i dont just want to change my mind about quitting dxm, but where i want to go act like im 16 and do stupid things generally.

im not directing any of this towards anyone its just here as a reference i guess.  my point is that i feel ways and i need someone that loves me to care and offer some support.  otherwise i really feel too alone and shit to give a fuck.  lol @ adult cries for help.  it usually worked a lot better when i was younger and i carved myself up or broke things or threatened suicide.  then i got immediate professional help and loving attention from people i loved.  lets see if i can continue being not 16.  if it doesnt work then i guess ill probably just not try to ask for any help at all and just go back to how it was before.

PS  i AM trying to help myself.  asking for help at all was the biggest thing i could have done because i obviously cant do it alone, ive tried before.  and also, i dont want to do it alone.  i dont like feeling alone and scared and sad.  the only help i need is a little patience and understanding and motivation maybe.  im going to push myself for 2 more days to care all by myself, and then we will see.

lol i really hate myself today."

im going to put in a 2 week notice to take 2 weeks off today, and then im going to spend 2 weeks not being on dxm and working out and stabalizing myself enough to stop feeling like i need dxm every minute of every day to be a happy interesting person.  

i love dxm, its helped me a lot, but i know i need to stop abusing it.  ive said this before but then i stop caring and dont follow through.  last night i finally asked for help and made some plans though.

"event","<A HREF=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva/bodhi-sattva's</A>i think that whats happening with me and my friend is that we are both, and i am having trouble dealing with my fellow <A HREF=http://kyky.essortment.com/whatisbodhisat_rfld.htm/bodhi-sattva's</A> friend being caged up and not able to perform his role.

somwhere in all this human mess a connection happened that was a mutual respect and admiration, and i tried to help him too much and it caused more caging which caused more energy exchanges which started feelings of attraction because of our playful, sexual, and rebellious personalities.  

i think i should back off and let it be and maybe sometime he and i will be able to connect in the way we would like to but in the mean time i need to continue my role as <A HREF=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva</A> and help his keeper out of this place of suffering she is in if i can.

anyway... we also smoked a lot of weed yesterday and giggled a lot about being easy going (and i bet you are too) and lots of talking about things happened that makes me feel very lucky to have my paddykins.  i never imagined being with someone who loved me so much that he could be a friend through any situation even one that would make most boys cry or punch or run away or ignore.  oh i keep forgetting to talk about my day.  

we came home at about 8 and acted cranky because we were tired and then went to bed.  today is sunny and i dont work so im going to make poems in the sun and be easy going.  i bet paddy will be too.

im really angry that i cant download any music.  fucking bearshare.  ive been feeling very musical lately.  i want to hear some fucking merle haggard ASAP.ive decided to listen to more rap and country music because i discovered recently that im just a good ole boy whos getting in touch with his african american roots."

Sing me a song of sadness 
And sing it as blue as I feel
If a tear should appear it's because she's not here 
Sing a sad song and sing it for me

She's unhappy with me she told me so 
I'm unhappy without her 
And I still love her so
Oh sing me a song of sadness 
Pretend it's the end of the world
Sing it sweet and sing it low 
And then I'll have to go sing a sad song
And sing it for me

Sing it sweet and sing it low 
And then I'll have to go sing a sad song
And sing it for me"

last night was pretty interesting.  lol i should probably make this friends only.  

allright so we decided to walk to the store and buy a huge bottle of tequila after i worked and paddy cleaned the house, but on the way there logan and lee passed in his moms car and hopped out to hang out with us and we all went back to the house and listened to queen and dead prez and radio head and talked about music and drank margaritas.  i was being a nazi with the alcohol becauze they kind of have a little moderation problem and so does paddy with the booze, lol.  but then i decided to get plastered because im always the booza nazi and i handed the bottle over to paddy because hes ale to be a booze nazi now and thats really cool.  

so i got pretty drunk in a non sloppy way which i warned everyone made me act a litte nuts ie; inhibitionless (which is so fun sometimes to just stop trying to do everything right and be a bad girl) and i was a bad girl, lol.

we played truth or dare around the campfire and tried to make logan and paddy make out but they just acted like boys and rolled around (and got paddys new khakis dirty) and said things like ""oh yeah baby do me"".  i kissed lee passionately which one of the like 2 girl kisses ive ever had.  <3 girls.  i think all of us ended up kissing one another except the boys (:() and oh lol i keep backspacing over juicy details because im a prude and aware of my live journal audience too.  i should not do that because im excited about FUN and want to gossip here.  hmm i touched a foriegn weiner with permission from its wife. its funny because logan dated my sister in like 7th grade and i always secretly wanted to be his friend and he secretly wanted to be mine too in high school because were both really weird or something.

"event","hello internet im updating from work because im extremely early.  i wanted to talk about how yesterday i got flipped out over space worm {http://murmurmaid.livejournal.com/144497.html#comments} and how his story is like the simple dumbed down version of every story ever written including the time i hallucinated a giant cock named benjamin (http://murmurmaid.livejournal.com/191536.html)  running down the street to an unknown goal and also every story in the bible and every other religious text.  oh and most importantly picture space worm as a sperm and also god and also a thought form and earth being an egg, man, and everything physical.  but what came first, the chicken or the egg?

so yeah last night i tripped out about that stuff and told paddy about it and he said it reminded him of some thing from waking life where this guy says a thing that i cant remember enough to quote but it turned out he was thinking of the same guy that i was also thinking of in waking life who reminded me of all of this stuff.  its the guy who talked about every story being the same story and some guy from the bible and some other stuff that i will definitely quote later when i can remember.

but anyway like space worms name is benjamin and he has a goal and hes determined to accomplish his goal which i just found out is existing which pretty much means everything experiencing itself till it remembers that its a benjamin and and egg and then it becomes a benjamin looking for another egg to fertilize.

and i also decided that in 2012 when there is a paradigm shift whats going to happen is our world will turn into a female dominated world literally and figuratively and there will be like a long period of receptiveness instead of projectiveness and thats neither positive or negative, or either depending on how you look at it.  for me it will be cool cause it means no more ""war"", of that kind that sucks now anyway.  all of this is really hard to explain and very exciting and im going to refer to it as being hopped up on jesus, but you can call me crazy if you want."

"event","once when i was on a shitload of gels and powders and whatnot i had a cartoon play in my head about ""benjamin the determined cock"". it was a giant penis running down the street, but he didnt have feet,  he also had a limo driver who shouted at him ""go benjamin go!"". the limo driver just stood next to his limo and yelled it as the penis ran down the street. i have no idea how the limo driver stayed in the picture because benjamin was really determined and going full speed ahead for whatever reason.

"event","im saying things: hi
im saying things: m saying things: the 
analogy of a stage play is not a bad 
one. an actoe on stage is clearly an 
""actor"" but we dont want him to 
appear to be an actor. an actor gives 
as good performance to the extent 
that he really gets into the role. 
wouldnt it spoil the role if the actor 
was continually looking over is 
shoulder and winking at the audience? 
we want the actor to get into the role, 
but definitely not to the point where he 
starts believeing that he is that role
so beth says: hahahaha
im saying things: that is going too far, 
it would take the fun out of the play, 
and it might be dangerous
im saying things: there might be real 
murders onstage
im saying things: thats from the book
so beth says: good
im saying things: m saying things: its 
talking about not confusing who you 
are with the role you play
so beth says: nice
so beth says: its easy to get caught up 
in roles
im saying things: like imagine jim 
carrey playing a role so hard that he 
becomes the character
im saying things: and forgets that hes 
just an actor
so beth says: yeah i hear it
so beth says: like
im saying things: i think he does that 
sometimes
so beth says: me thinking so hard that 
im bethany turner that i forget to be 
cosmic
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: people just truly think 
theyre the people theyre born as
im saying things: the ego is ok and 
now i am finally ok with it
im saying things: because it helps us 
play our role
so beth says: ooh
Terrorism is AOK: thats all good, but you can be the 
role you play
Terrorism is AOK: if youre not busy taking other 
peoples leads and following other peoples footsteps
im saying things: yes you can
Terrorism is AOK: for instance
im saying things: if you shoose to
Terrorism is AOK: people online often become other 
people
Terrorism is AOK: then someone meets them offline
Terrorism is AOK: and theyre another person
im saying things: yes i did
im saying things: oops wrongf windoe
im saying things: keep going
Terrorism is AOK: the people ive met or that know me 
know, that i dont play a particular role...all i can do is 
exist, and ""be""...for better or for worse.
Terrorism is AOK: alot of people dont know that or 
havent learned that
Terrorism is AOK: putting up a facade is work
im saying things: yeah
Terrorism is AOK: if i was on stage at the end of me 
bieng on stage
Terrorism is AOK: when i walk around
Terrorism is AOK: id like people to know me better
Terrorism is AOK: not know what they want to know
im saying things: but undersatanding the 
balance enough toi communicate with 
oyther people is important to me
Terrorism is AOK: or have a built up appreciation for 
me that i cant live as
Terrorism is AOK: i use that balance and at other times 
i dont.
im saying things: yeah i know
Terrorism is AOK: its deciding who you want to 
connect with, who youd like to learn with or teach or 
learn form
im saying things: i love you
Terrorism is AOK: and that cant be everyone.
Terrorism is AOK: =] whered that come from haha
im saying things: haha
im saying things: i just grok you
Terrorism is AOK: my girlfriend wont even tell me she 
loves me
im saying things: and i enjoy this
im saying things: lol
Terrorism is AOK: bu my friends tell me it all the time. 
odd
im saying things: i want to be your internet 
girlfriend
Terrorism is AOK: lol

Terrorism is AOK: i stopped having internet girlfriends 
when i turned 17
im saying things: so
im saying things: have another
im saying things: <3
Terrorism is AOK: and not to toot my horn but theres 
enough girls online that think that way about me...
Terrorism is AOK: and its causing internet girl fights

im saying things: i think our roles clash a 
lot

worth it
im saying things: oh i guess now maybe im 
feeling that im just a girl on the 
internet
im saying things: and not too important to 
you
im saying things: which makes me sad
Terrorism is AOK: well
Terrorism is AOK: isnt that sort of the reality of things?
im saying things: no 
im saying things: it isnt
Terrorism is AOK: were friends but ive never met you, 
i dont know you, you have no idea what i look like
im saying things: because im asking for 
you to connect with me
im saying things: and you are kind of 
refusing
Terrorism is AOK: the only time ive spoken to you, is 
on the internet
im saying things: and i dont understand
Terrorism is AOK: no...im not
Terrorism is AOK: you may be high and be taking it as 
that
Terrorism is AOK: or
Terrorism is AOK: i dont know what sort of 
connection you  mean
im saying things: i guesss i just feel like its 
important to be real life friends with 
you
Terrorism is AOK: but im not refusing
Terrorism is AOK: i mean...even my friends remain 
friends at a distance to some point
Terrorism is AOK: my best friends
im saying things: yeah i know
im saying things: i just want to be like
im saying things: acknowledged that im 
more to you than aome random girl on 
the internet, like maybe that you like 
me or something
im saying things: but that probaly a needy 
thing fo rme
im saying things: im sorry
im saying things: its just har to care so 
much for a person who doesnt feel the 
same way in return
im saying things: and i dont want to push
im saying things: so i should stop
im saying things: im on dxm btw
Terrorism is AOK: it could be a needy thing
Terrorism is AOK: and i figured you were on dxm
im saying things: take your time getting to 
know me in your limits i understand
im saying things: im sorry that im to pushy
im saying things: im trying to work on that
Terrorism is AOK: i know alot of people on the 
internet so i cant just point at one person and say i like 
you best..things like that take time
im saying things: lol i know

im saying things: lol her room was locked and it was HER ROOM for stupid reasons
im saying things: but i know i was wrong
im saying things: paddy wanted to pick the lock for practice
so beth says: well

im saying things: lol yeah i know i was wrong
so beth says: well how are you and your sister about sharing and stuff
im saying things: we shouldnt have done that
so beth says: i guess since im not in that situation
im saying things: my sister and mom are both very serious about their privacy
so beth says: like it makes sense that under those circumstances you shouldnt do that
so beth says: oh ok
so beth says: yeah i dont know
so beth says: where does jodi live?
im saying things: but ""that kind of thing"" makes me fel like im a person who sucks
im saying things: a little ways away
im saying things: but lemme tell my story lol
im saying things: shut up
so beth says: yeah sorry i know thats what you wanted to focus on
so beth says: hahah 
im saying things: <3
so beth says: i was about to shut myself up
so beth says: YOU GO
im saying things: ok so that made me feel like my mom just stil think theres something wrong with me instead of having a daughter with strange personality traits
im saying things: that exist because of ways that she was raised
im saying things: she being me
so beth says: right
im saying things: and i finally just kind of had t have it out with her
im saying things: and explain to her
im saying things: like
so beth says: like you should be FIXED
im saying things: there is no blame in this
im saying things: but you and jodi are the biggest reson why im like THIS
im saying things: why im self concious
im saying things: and mentally diseased
im saying things: or whatever
im saying things: she thinks i am or was
so beth says: aw does she/you think youre mentally diseased
im saying things: because im amazing and i couldnt bloom like i should have in my environment
im saying things: no
im saying things: i mean my mental problems or whatever
so beth says: were you being cool and sarcastic about the situation

im saying things: that happened in the past
so beth says: yeah
im saying things: no i was being cool and nice
im saying things: and crying
so beth says: no i meant just now
so beth says: haha keep going
so beth says: we got tangled
im saying things: like i wanted to let her know that i didnt htink she was a bad mother and that i understood why it happened and it wasnt anyones fault but this is why
so beth says: im glad you siad that to your mom
so beth says: how was your mom when you were growing up
im saying things: because i was like different and didnt know how to exist and i got no attention so i had to like do things like it people and cut myself and try to drive my moms car off the road while driving and steal things from everyone and do drugs and fuck a lot
im saying things: and get put in mental homes
im saying things: for being insane and trying to stab my sister for calling me fat
im saying things: but like
im saying things: i wa a genious surrounded by mundanes who told me everything was wrong with me
im saying things: and i was a sensitive child
im saying things: my dad had just died

so beth says: about youself
so beth says: you rule
im saying things: and my sister like hated me
im saying things: and my mom was having an idntity crisis
im saying things: and didnt know how to raise us
so beth says: i didnt know all those details about you and im glad you told me them because details let me love all parts of the timeline of you more
im saying things: 
im saying things: but i had to tell her that i was upset that she never rwd any of the books that the head doctors told her to read to help her deal with me
im saying things: but i understood that she was a sinfgle mom who had to work
so beth says: im actually really curious about stuff like the ways that you acted in past times because i think youre such a powerful beautiful force and it amazes me to see your thoughts and shit
im saying things: haha id love to tell you stories
so beth says: like i just met you two years ago

im saying things: 
so beth says: and you always refer to a past you and i really just cant get a picture of it because i dnt know
im saying things: yeah im getting to know myself a lot better
so beth says: like hwen you talk about your past behaviors i just see the personality that is inherent in you just like trying to thrive or understand itself in bizarre environments tha ti doesntr get yet
so beth says: i like learning about you a lot we should share details sometime
im saying things: it makes me feel good to know that you are interested in that
im saying things: we should
so beth says: haha i have less stories due to less time
im saying things: i want to tell you my life story

im saying things: yeah i am more of a visual person
so beth says: right before jason died

so beth says: i felt so free and happy that i was just going to tell the story
so beth says: and i dont think i'll ever be that levitated from responsibility again so at some time im just oging to have to get back to it and crank it out
so beth says: like im a writer and i do want to weave my experiences together in a web of words
so beth says: but i would like to see you talk about yours
so beth says: like detailed hahaha

so beth says: i think were limited in this universe for a reason though
so beth says: i mean not having access to that kind of data
so beth says: we have to learn how to draw it out of other people
im saying things: thats why i want my brain to be hooked up to a computer
so beth says: and learn that we cant make conclusions about people based on anything
so beth says: because we dont have that movie
so beth says: i think it works best this way
so beth says: like in a heaven realm we would just get all that data
so beth says: we could get like stats on anything haha

so beth says: my mom loves it
so beth says: jason showed it to me
so beth says: and you love it
so beth says: i showed it to my mom
so beth says: and like
so beth says: i think it's here for a fucking reason haha
im saying things: i know
so beth says: seriously my mom and i got a lot closer due to talking about the issues covered in six feet under
im saying things: its a god movie
so beth says: i dream about it
im saying things: me too
so beth says: i feel linked with that fictional universe in a weird way
so beth says: like outside of the actors and storylines like
so beth says: that lesson
im saying things: me too
so beth says: jason showed it to me right before he killed himsel;f
so beth says: katie jason probably might have planned what he did
im saying things: me too beth
im saying things: really?
so beth says: ok
so beth says: time
so beth says: has passed
so beth says: this is what i learned from what detectives told my parents
so beth says: jason was about to lose his job
so beth says: i didnt know that
so beth says: he hadnt been paying rent and would have gotten evicted
so beth says: i didnt know that
so beth says: he killed himself like right before his child was born
so beth says: like the week before
so beth says: like responsibility and life was just about to end his fairy tale
so beth says: it was just about over
so beth says: now, i had no idea
im saying things: WOW
so beth says: but he owed the irs a shitton of money i think maybe
so beth says: he wasnt answering the phone due to bill collectors
so beth says: and in january he said something to prepare me
so beth says: and the more i think about it the more it feels right like something he meant to do i dont know if its just easier to think of it taht way or what, but theres like evidence
so beth says: that his life was about to get fucked up and he like ended it on a good note, now i really do think
im saying things: what did he say
so beth says: that the reason he stabbed me
im saying things: oh
so beth says: is because he really thought that i would go with him
so beth says: oh what he said was
so beth says: i think i have said this to you before but
so beth says: he said that we see each other every lifetime, we make a point to find each other, and he always leaves me too soon
im saying things: but i dont thinkhe planned to do it in that way
so beth says: you know what hurts katie
im saying things: what
so beth says: the more i live on my own
so beth says: like its just the farther away i get from feeling like i belong to that other person -- and it hurts on a human level, but it's ok because i know that we're all just parts of each other
so beth says: and this life is just interesting lessons about love
so beth says: i dont want to even talk about people as individuals anymore sometimes
im saying things: i know
so beth says: like ""my mate"" or ""death""
so beth says: i juist feel like io know
im saying things: i keep wanting to say something about how i feel about jason
so beth says: that what i really have to make myself swallow
im saying things: but i dont knwo how
so beth says: is that everyone is me
so beth says: how do you feel
im saying things: what he did
so beth says: say everything because its time its ok
im saying things: was so childlike
so beth says: yeah
im saying things: and simple alomst
im saying things: and beautiful
im saying things: in a horrible way
so beth says: i know
so beth says: like
im saying things: like his brain couldnt handle the brilliance that it held
im saying things: so he always poofs out
so beth says: yeah
so beth says: yeah
so beth says: exactly
im saying things: i love him
so beth says: he was so scared when he said that
so beth says: about always leaving
so beth says: im glad 
im saying things: i know him
so beth says: he said he was sorry
im saying things: its strange
so beth says: im really glad
im saying things: he said he was sorry?
so beth says: yes
im saying things: about leaving?
so beth says: sorry that he always had to leave me every lifetime
so beth says: but that he had to because life was too much
im saying things: did he alwyas try to take you with him every lifetime?
so beth says: i dont know if im putting words in his mouth but i feel those things from him
im saying things: its like he keeps coming back just to experience you but he doesnt belong here
so beth says: i dont know if he tried to take me with him
so beth says: wow thats a good point
so beth says: i love him
im saying things: i know
im saying things: hes like still there
im saying things: you know
so beth says: he didnt belong here
im saying things: let me say something
so beth says: i know
so beth says: ok
im saying things: i think that hes coming back so you can experience him
im saying things: because you always need to
so beth says: :D
im saying things: but he cant handle this plane of existance or something
im saying things: so its always tragic
im saying things: but it doesnt have to be
so beth says: :>
im saying things: now that you know this
im saying things: it just has to be that way
so beth says: i love him
so beth says: im so glad he does this for me
im saying things: you really need to rerad the midnight club
so beth says: i know im not even being self centered
so beth says: like i used to be like
so beth says: how can i focus jasons whole life around me
so beth says: but he ended his life with mine so he must have put that importance there
im saying things: no it is
so beth says: it seems obvious to me
so beth says: he TOLD me that he lived for me and that he thought i was born at the moment he imagined me when he first had female fantasies at 143
so beth says: *13
im saying things: its liek he doesnt remember why he came back until he finds you
so beth says: thats what he would sya
im saying things: then he remembers and its all so painful that he has to die
im saying things: wow
so beth says: why does it have to be that way
im saying things: because
im saying things: you should read that book

im saying things: i know this lifetime rocks
im saying things: i hope im a black person next
so beth says: haha
so beth says: i want to be hmmm
so beth says: i dont know its weird like
im saying things: i want to be a black person like in australia, an aborigonie
im saying things: or in africa in one of those weird tribes
so beth says: some people live lives that are really not leveld up
so beth says: and i think we all live all of those
so beth says: jason realized that before he died
im saying things: or like the dali lama
so beth says: he came back from a dxm trip and said he had learned that everyone just came back and lived life again through different eyes
im saying things: thats what i want to be nxt
im saying things: yea
so beth says: haha i wnat to be the catholic pope
so beth says: jk but
im saying things: haha
so beth says: jason didnt see it as like eastern spiritual oneness, he was more of a narcisist
so beth says: he still thought he was his own entity
im saying things: haha
im saying things: well he is kind of
im saying things: cause he made himself one
so beth says: reincarnation is just a way of expressing that there is no separation
so beth says: yeah
im saying things: hes liek a ghost
so beth says: for that time being he is
im saying things: hes always trying to be with you somewhere
im saying things: i think hes figuring it out
im saying things: each time
im saying things: better
im saying things: that hes everything
im saying things: and there is no real you and he
so beth says: yeahg
im saying things: then maybe he can stop doing that stuff
so beth says: haha its like the cosmic boy falling for me example
so beth says: and like
so beth says: just a dramatic example of what everything is
im saying things: thats pretty cool to think about
im saying things: i mean
im saying things: big
so beth says: yeah the individual ego is like the root of all the pain
so beth says: and problems and wonderings
im saying things: oh beth the ego
im saying things: something i read
im saying things: you must read
so beth says: what is it
im saying things: i need to take pictures from the pages of this book
im saying things: or type it to you
im saying things: or maybe its on the internet
im saying things: lemme fined it
so beth says: ok
im saying things: i dunno how well this explains what i want to tell you
im saying things: but lets read it together
im saying things: http://www.geocities.com/neovedanta/a87.html
so beth says: ok
im saying things: i think its written badly
im saying things: this book has a way of explaining it that makes it easy to understand
im saying things: ill type something
so beth says: its really wordy yeah'
so beth says: talk to me
so beth says: i mean tell me where you are
im saying things: the analogy of a stage play is not a bad one.  an actoe on stage is clearly an ""actor"" but we dont want him to appear to be an actor.  an actor gives as good performance to the extent that he really gets into the role.  wouldnt it spoil the role if the actor was continually looking over is shoulder and winking at the audience?  we want the actor to get into the role, but definitely not to the point where he starts believeing that he is that role
so beth says: hahahaha
im saying things: that is going too far, it would take the fun out of the play, and it might be dangerous
im saying things: there might be real murders onstage
im saying things: thats from the book
so beth says: good
im saying things: its talking about not confusing who you are with the role you play
so beth says: nice
so beth says: its easy to get caught up in roles
im saying things: like imagine jim carrey playing a role so hard that he becomes the character
im saying things: and forgets that hes just an actor
so beth says: yeah i hear it
so beth says: like
im saying things: i think he does that sometimes
so beth says: me thinking so hard that im bethany turner that i forget to be cosmic
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: people just truly think theyre the people theyre born as
im saying things: the ego is ok and now i am finally ok with it
im saying things: because it helps us play our role
so beth says: ooh
so beth says: thanks
im saying things: thank the book
im saying things: you should buy it
so beth says: yeah otherwise i would just drift
im saying things: its intense
so beth says: whats it called
im saying things: awakening, an introduction to the history of eastern thought
so beth says: who wrote it
im saying things: zeoh left it hear
im saying things: patrick bresnan
so beth says: have you communicated with zeph any more than the lj comment
im saying things: i havent responded to his comment
im saying things: he also called tori
im saying things: and left a message
im saying things: and was very fucked up
im saying things: he called me too
im saying things: i didnt want to talk to him on cough medicine
so beth says: did you talk to him
so beth says: oh ok
im saying things: i dont know ow to respond
so beth says: well im just being curious about where he is and what he's doing but it seems he's being slushy
im saying things: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0130989088/102-5902960-9198534?v=glance&n=283155
im saying things: hes working at mcdonalds i guess
im saying things: and living with his mom
so beth says: i mean 
so beth says: oh
im saying things: i think iu want to talk to him
im saying things: but not on the phone
so beth says: yeah like
im saying things: and see where he is mentally
so beth says: yteah
so beth says: people
im saying things: i dont understand how zeph can have all these cool books and not be leveled up
im saying things: i think he tries to have an image maybe
im saying things: i cant tell
im saying things: i dont mean it to be mean even
im saying things: i just dont understand
so beth says: yeah trying to have an image is really basic though so if hes not leveld up at all that might be why haha
so beth says: i want to help but like
so beth says: i mean generally, people
so beth says: and i don't know
so beth says: that book is so expensive
im saying things: i know
im saying things: i should make copies of the good pages for you
so beth says: haha yeah
im saying things: i need a scanner
im saying things: im going to get one soon
im saying things: in fact i think il have one by saturday
so beth says: my ipod just ran out of batteries
so beth says: so now i remember where i am
so beth says: lol ipods are hilarious
im saying things: lol
im saying things: ipod
im saying things: beth i just had a thought
im saying things: i want to put my penis in your vagina a lot
so beth says: hahahaha
im saying things: but i dont have one
so beth says: thats why they make fake ones
im saying things: no man
so beth says: sorry that wasnt a very smart cosmic response
im saying things: i want to feel my penis isn your vagina
so beth says: its like
so beth says: yeah
so beth says: it sucks when your bodies arent right
so beth says: to do the life dance
im saying things: its hard to connect in a way that i want to connect with you because of the lack of phallus
im saying things: lol yeah or that
so beth says: yeah lets get a detachable one
im saying things: haha no that doesnt sound right it sounds bad
so beth says: well i mean like a real one like
so beth says: WESTERN MEDICINE IS AMAZING KATIE
so beth says: :-!
im saying things: oh maybe like a two way dildo with a crystal in the middle
so beth says: i was watching a thing about sex change surgery and it made me think a lot
so beth says: haha yes omg crystals
so beth says: sex change surgery
im saying things: lol could we get a velcro penis
so beth says: like in some parts of the world humans have the choice
so beth says: if theyre really serious
so beth says: to switch
im saying things: yeah its weird
so beth says: because we can medically alter the body
so beth says: and llike
so beth says: i mean its ok to want to do that but i dont know i think that like you can just wait it out and experience
im saying things: the tree of life, we found it in the west
so beth says: like i can relate a lot
so beth says: haha
im saying things: the tree of knowledge in the east
so beth says: i mean i guess i cant
so beth says: relate
so beth says: because i dont feel like i have to change my sex or die
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: so i dont know about it at all
im saying things: i can wait to be a man
so beth says: nvm
so beth says: yeah
im saying things: but like
im saying things: it would be cool
im saying things: like a peircing
im saying things: mayeb when im old
so beth says: hahahaha
im saying things: ill do it just because
so beth says: i think that 
so beth says: you have to take a lot of hormones and shit
so beth says: and need to be young
im saying things: and i will also become a leopard man
so beth says: BUT
so beth says: i bet the surgery will be great by that time
so beth says: lets be healthy so we get old
im saying things: lol after i have my hysterectomy or go through menopause
im saying things: yeah me and paddy have been talking abut thast
so beth says: haha yeah
so beth says: yeah seriously i want to live a long time
so beth says: i quit smoking
im saying things: oh i just got trippd out
so beth says: i havent smoked in a month or more
im saying things: about hermaphrodites
im saying things: good for yu
im saying things: can i say something
so beth says: im like scared to smoke again
im saying things: about hermaphrodites
so beth says: yeah do it to is
so beth says: t
im saying things: ok like adam is the man phallus thing
im saying things: and eve was taken from his side
im saying things: she is man
im saying things: stilll
im saying things: but different
so beth says: yes
im saying things: and like
im saying things: when she stops being a women she is just a hermaphrodite agaion
im saying things: after menipause
im saying things: we are just like the feminine taken out of the masculine
im saying things: the masculinme has all of it
im saying things: i dont know how to explain
so beth says: yeah according to one particular creationist theory though
im saying things: no i mean
so beth says: i mean i see that angle but 
im saying things: im usuing that as like
im saying things: a metaphor
so beth says: ok
so beth says: but i think of the genders as like
so beth says: same and balancing
so beth says: moreso than one encompassing another and like
im saying things: hmm
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: menopause i think gets too talked up as end of womanhood
im saying things: thats probably more like it
im saying things: i dunno it weird me out
so beth says: i think that any time you are trying to make peace with two things
so beth says: balancing them is key
so beth says: like two big ideas
so beth says: but hermaphrodites
so beth says: make me think a lot and wig out
so beth says: i mean 
so beth says: theres no set way that things happen
so beth says: its just cells
so beth says: splitting
so beth says: katie if you learned about some hard biology 
so beth says: you would trip the fuck out
im saying things: i know
so beth says: study biology like reproductive basic cellular biology
im saying things: ive been thinkijg about hermaphrodited

essences of beautiful 
four limbs in a pile 
severing a misanthrope 
knotting up a smile 

two dismembered armchairs 
decapitated state 
rope around the bottleneck 
choking out a fate 

walls can hear the whisper 
windows told the lies 
passing stove a tissue 
to wipe his burning eyes 

whittle out a voicebox 
then whistle how you choose 
tie the laces steady 
keep that tongue inside your shoes 

table runs his last leg 
too fast to cheat the race 
with her shaking minute hands 
clock covers her face 

scratch until the kettle sings 
tears to fill the ladle 
gag and bind the telephone 
crying in her cradle 

comb's teeth start to chatter 
like a book without a spine 
for the killer second every 
single hour is mine 

im saying things: i dont understand what your getting at but its beautiful
so beth says: i dont either
so beth says: its just like
so beth says: i took all the parts of objects that have human parts

single hour is mine

so beth says: and staacking things on top of each other
so beth says: and peeling back layers
so beth says: days dissipate, stretch out as clouds across themselves, 
transparent like water on water, rain on window, pain 
on an honest face. when will the sunlight settle 

into sediment, elementary progress of one to three. 
layer-cake for the widow's wedding.

im saying things: oh i know
so beth says: and he wanted to talk about it haha so i told him my heart had been restarted too and i tried to ask him out but he turned me down :<
so beth says: i think subtle

im saying things: the people that tell me ""theres something about you"" make me want to date them
so beth says: haha yeah
im saying things: ok the guy
im saying things: hes a black man 
im saying things: but like my ageish and not so black in the facw
im saying things: i dont know what im sayign
im saying things: anyway he seemed nice and he seems like he knows about herbals
im saying things: i asked about empty gel caps and he told me about a store that sold herbs and capsules
im saying things: and then he bent down to help me find cheap capsules to empty out
im saying things: and i almost fell backwards when i squatted
im saying things: and he said a lot of weird shit abotu how he would have caught me when i fell and he would have dne ""jazz hands""
im saying things: i dont remember what else he said but it was very cute and i think he had a crush on me
im saying things: and i had a crush on him
im saying things: and i went back to get the caps cause i didnt have my card
so beth says: sorry i was emailing
im saying things: and i touched his bicep in a friendly manner 
im saying things: then i asked paddy if i could have an affair with him
so beth says: lol not so black in the face
im saying things: lol i mean like hes probably got some white inhim he looked intyeresting
so beth says: haha asking if you can have an affair rules
im saying things: i know
so beth says: i trip out a lot about how lucky i am because i just recently realized that the boy i love will let me have affairs and like how important that is, i know i talk about it a lot but i seriously am like still getting used to it
im saying things: paddy said yes as long as he can buy 100$ worth of vitamins at vitamin world
im saying things: i know its weird huh
im saying things: i cant hardly get used to it enough to have an affair
so beth says: hahaha
so beth says: yeah like i dont want to have an affair yet
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: i havent even like been in the same place as the boy in over a year
so beth says: he deserves attention
so beth says: for sticking around while i had like 3 stupid affairs
so beth says: i need corey's address :-!
im saying things: ask danielle for it lol
im saying things: its on my other computer
so beth says: haha 
so beth says: ok does she have it
so beth says: i hope she writes him letters
im saying things: yeah i gave it toher
im saying things: her letter is like 20 pages long so far
so beth says: does she want to write him letters
so beth says: ok thats good
so beth says: like
so beth says: PERMISSION TO SPEAK FREELY
so beth says: :-!
im saying things: huh?
so beth says: i feel likea huge bitch but part of me wants to work the situation in such a way that like
so beth says: oh i was requesting permission to be a selgish human and say what im thinking
im saying things: oh sure
so beth says: i dont know i keep trying to write corey things and not having the slightest clue what he needs to hear or what i want to say
so beth says: and being like oww i dont know him at all and like
im saying things: tell him how it is
im saying things: thats what he neds
im saying things: jail is the besrt place for him to be to meditate on this kind of stuff
so beth says: tahts true
im saying things: i really kind of dont know what to say to him
so beth says: yeah i dont either and so much time has passed that i already said something with that
so beth says: like whether i wanted to or not
im saying things: yeah me too and that upsets me
so beth says: its like oh i didnt feel a burning need to comfort and help you and be someone that loves you
so beth says: but like one of the things about what happened
so beth says: is that he showed up here and i just like drained myself to the max to make him feel happy
so beth says: and once he was gone i was like holy shit
so beth says: so tired
so beth says: and not really that replenished by any part of him
so beth says: just fucking tired and kind of distant from myself
im saying things: yeah i know
so beth says: and glad to have time alone
so beth says: and relief that i wasnt responsible for him not being sad 
im saying things: you dont need energy suckers
so beth says: anymore
im saying things: he needs to learn to not be one
so beth says: yeah its not his fault like
so beth says: he wasnt NOT NICE to me at all
im saying things: yeah i know
so beth says: he was like doing what he thought was best and right we're just not love partners
so beth says: and he had a lot of expectations of me after the fact
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: and that doesnt work in love partnership
so beth says: so like honestly i feel sort of hurt and used by him even though i know that wasnt his intent
im saying things: he hasnt leveled up enough yet to comprehend that
so beth says: so i dont really feel that fucking gung ho about writing to him just because he fucking needs it
so beth says: but i have to get past that
so beth says: because like it or not i'm involved in his universe somewhat and im not a person who can just be like
so beth says: shut off when i get tired
so beth says: thats not cool
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: i did that with someone else recently
so beth says: i was so fucking drained
so beth says: i was fucking this guy 
im saying things: who?
so beth says: edvin lol
im saying things: someone i dont know about?
so beth says: and i was spending all this time at his house because i felt like
so beth says: i dont know i havent talked about him a lot but i wrote about him in my livejournal some
so beth says: in vague ways i was really fucking distant
so beth says: and didnt know what i was doing or why
so beth says: but i felt like i owed him myself after i started fucking him
so beth says: and just got totally lost
so beth says: and uncentered
im saying things: yeah that happens
so beth says: giving all this attention to a guy who's really lame and boring and doesnt think like me at all
so beth says: then corey came to town and i like broke it off with edvin 
so beth says: because corey wanted me to be his one and only girlfriend rol
so beth says: f
so beth says: then corey left and edvin was all wanting to fuck me again even though he had insulted me
so beth says: and i was so tired
so beth says: i was so fucking far away from myself
im saying things: he insulted you?
so beth says: so i spent some time with edvin like hating it
so beth says: i dont know he said i was just like an american woman who uses people for what she wants haha
im saying things: oh i remember that
so beth says: i dont know this guy is really like outside of anything i care about
so beth says: anyway he just was in a car wreck and broke his leg
im saying things: its the foriegn guy
so beth says: and i have like not gone to visit him and been glad he was out of school
so beth says: yeah
so beth says: and i sent him this short little email saying that i cant have any sort of relationship with him
so beth says: like two lines
so beth says: and thats sort of what i feel like im doing with corey
so beth says: leading people on hardcore then just poofing out
im saying things: well
so beth says: but its like im taking care of myself
so beth says: i cant go out giving everything to suckers of energy
im saying things: with corey you just need to tell him the truth, how you feel and what happened
so beth says: yes
im saying things: and i dont think you want to not have a relationship with him
im saying things: so tell him that too
im saying things: just set it straight
so beth says: yeah
so beth says: it's true
so beth says:  i love you because you like
so beth says: tell me when i need to do things 
im saying things: 
so beth says: boys boys boys
im saying things: i cant wait to be in person with you and try to describve the secrets of the universe to you
so beth says: i realized something the other day that made me just like turn the fuck around and stop
im saying things: that ive discovered
so beth says: yay!
im saying things: what did you realize
so beth says: yeah i'll tell you mine too
so beth says: i just remembered shit about jason that i havent even been keeping with me
so beth says: about what he showed me about how i deserve to be treated
so beth says: and how when i was being with him i like promised myself not to get used by boys again because i didnt just need to get fucked to prove to myself that i was worth things because i already know im awesome
so beth says: and that i had already learned that not being with any boys can be better than being with every possile boy
so beth says: and i noticed that i have not been remembering that shit at all recently
im saying things: yes
im saying things: i have to remind myself of that a lot
so beth says: and i felt sad and i missed jason a lot and i felt like he was still around in the universe like watching me and waiting for me to come back around and be strong
so beth says: its weird like
so beth says: a person died and i hate that i like
so beth says: use him as a symbol
im saying things: beth have you read anything on hinduism
so beth says: but i dont think he would mind
so beth says: i know its all stuff that i know in myself anyway
so beth says: i just like him as a symbol cause i love him and i want him around
so beth says: thats why im glad i got this tattoo
so beth says: hold on let me say this
im saying things: me too
so beth says: like i got the tattoo before i fucked any boys
so beth says: so now its like
so beth says: even if i fuck a boy on accident that doesnt deserve me
so beth says: i really feel invincible because i already have this thing
so beth says: its weird like
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: its like a good luck charm against getting used 
so beth says: sexually by people haha or not respecting myself
im saying things: yeah like you stil arent used even if you do it
im saying things: cause your experiencing
so beth says: exactly like
so beth says: i could have just told myself ""ok i love myself now for sure""
so beth says: but i put the tattoo there so i cant be like ""oh wait did i say that or not""
so beth says: and when i got the tattoo i even like
so beth says: really wanted to fuck a boy the days before
so beth says: but i wouldnt 
so beth says: even though he would have
so beth says: becaue i didnt have a tattoo yet
so beth says: and its like a thing i did that wasnt just like
so beth says: base and lustful
so beth says: so i know i did it and im not worried about being a sluit
im saying things: paddy is like my tattoo he helps me remember that
so beth says: <3 ok
so beth says: omg
so beth says: im glad you have paddy a lot
im saying things: me too
so beth says: i really liked your description of having sex haha
im saying things: and im sorry that you dont have jason now even though i kind oif think it haoppened for a reason
so beth says: well
so beth says: yeah
im saying things: it makes me sad
so beth says: i feel that way and like
so beth says: its not just time healing or whatever its like
so beth says: im seeing the bigger pattern
so beth says: and i learned so many lessons from jason and like
so beth says: if he were alive now
so beth says: i wouldnt be where i am now
so beth says: and i like where i am and
so beth says: i finally got to that point
so beth says: .
so beth says: like when he died
so beth says: i was like, i remember thinking
so beth says: that in the future i would have built up a self without jason taht i liked so much that i wouldnt change the past even though it hurt
so beth says: but i wasnt at that point yet and it just hurt so bad
so beth says: but im at that place now where i accept that event as a true part of this version of the universe
im saying things: yes
im saying things: thats awesome
so beth says: and i have other things that arent jason related that ground me to the world adn thats healthy
so beth says: it still makes me sad but like
so beth says: my mom said right when i got home
im saying things: and actually it scares me a lot 
so beth says: me too 
so beth says: its like
im saying things: about losing paddy i dont know if i could do that
im saying things: i thin id die
so beth says: oh ok i see
so beth says: you know what
so beth says: paddy is so important for you
so beth says: you would change permanently
im saying things: i want to die with him
so beth says: and a lot of people would grieve for paddy a lot
so beth says: and maybe you will get to die with him
so beth says: i hope you get to die together after a long life
im saying things: me too
so beth says: and i think paddy is best for you
so beth says: i relaly dont think he'll die on accident
im saying things: we are adjusting everything we do so we can die together
im saying things: i hope not
so beth says: jason was the best thing in my life at that time, but his own path was ending
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: he was finishing up
so beth says: and its best this way
so beth says: you and paddy have made a path togetyher
im saying things: yeah
im saying things: the pathie
im saying things: your ther too
so beth says: i dont think he'll die accidentally and if he did a lot of us would have been wrong about the universe
so beth says: yeah i am :>
so beth says: i love you
im saying things: i love you too
im saying things: intensely
so beth says: how much do you talk to sarah
so beth says: like now
im saying things: not much at all
so beth says: this era of life
so beth says: do you feel close to her
im saying things: yes i do
im saying things: but
im saying things: not in the same way
im saying things: shes like my sister
im saying things: that i dont talk to 
im saying things: except in the cosmos
so beth says: yeah im so gald
so beth says: like 
so beth says: ok ive known you for like two years or more
so beth says: and i remember i used to feel things like worry about female jealousies in friendships
im saying things: me too
so beth says: but i think everybody is basically leveled the fuck up
im saying things: me too
so beth says: haha and i just feel so lucky that like
im saying things: i think sarah understands our relationship
so beth says: whose yours and hers or yours and mine
im saying things: yeah

so beth says: i was asking which one and you said yeah so thats cool
im saying things: haha
im saying things: lol
so beth says: like
im saying things: ok um
so beth says: i want to tell one story
im saying things: ok
so beth says: ok the way that i made friends with sarah was you told me about her and i had a crush on her and i thought she thought she was too cool, then one day she launched out with this big IM about how i was a smart girl who had owned the dextroverse and she admired my style, so we made friends, but it was different than with you because your heart is just like right out there and with sarah i felt a degree of like competition and performance anxiety like a long time ago
so beth says: anyway so obviously the internet chats with itself 24/7 and bonds tighten
im saying things: yeah with sarah
so beth says: and it was weird like i felt so close to both of you and i had met you both on the basis of the fact that you were friends with each other but i never saw you communicate with each other
im saying things: it was kinda lie that for me too
im saying things: there are some barriers with sarah that arent there with you
so beth says: and for the past like
so beth says: yeah
so beth says: not really recently, but like the months taht came before these past months
so beth says: you were gone from teh internet like woah
so beth says: and i missed you 
so beth says: but you know the internet keeps rolling and shit and there was this one time period
so beth says: where i was chatting with sarah like every day a lot
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: and we were both going to school and comparing like
so beth says: lifes and times and then it was like ok wtf
so beth says: you had not been on the internet at all
im saying things: yeah
so beth says: so one day i was talking to sarah about it
im saying things: i know
so beth says: i was like wheres katie i miss her
so beth says: and sarah said this one thing
so beth says: that made me feel really happy and i want to express this sentiment to you 
im saying things: tell me
so beth says: she was just like ""yeah what's up with this i miss her too, let's get our katie back""
im saying things: aw
so beth says: yeah it was so sweet
im saying things: i was so burned out
so beth says: i mean we knew you were just living RL and shit it was just a sentiment
im saying things: from social things

so beth says: i feel really close to her
so beth says: i cant wait until a day when
so beth says: the three of us can be in the same room and like
so beth says: balance out energies
so beth says: and just meet
so beth says: and be in the same place
so beth says: like i dont know if either of you think thats as awesome as i do but like
im saying things: i do
so beth says: haha sometimes i feel like a big dork being like FEMALE FRIENDSHIP POWER but
im saying things: no i know
im saying things: i kind of feel like paddy shpuld be a part of that female energy to tho
so beth says: yeah theres no exclusion like
so beth says: paddy is there he is paddy

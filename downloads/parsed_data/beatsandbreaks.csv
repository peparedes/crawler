"event","it's kinda weird. raul says that they have great fried chicken...i think i'll take his word on it. we're all just hanging out tonight., raul, steph, laura  and i.it's nice to just chill and talk about nothing much.

gee, i haven't updated lately. maybe because nothing that positive has happened. and so i though i'd spare everyone the long sob story...i'm alright and hopefully things are back to normal. hopefully.
it looks like we're all be going out a lot now.  sara has informed me of all the upcoming shows. it's been a while since i've gone to a show. and to be quite frank, i was losing faith in indie-rock. but having the mountain goats coming soon makes up for the long pause."

yesterday i met my favorite curator fred wilson. he was awesome. i was super bummed that i didn't apply for graduate school at ccac, because he was the guest teacher and i really wanted to study under him. but having met him yesterday and talking to him i know i want to not only be his student but his friend. i think we really hit it off. he invited me to his art show in berkeley, and said he wanted to stop in the center again. hopefully we will keep in touch. i'm telling you, working for the education department i have met so many great artist and especially curators.
last night i started my crochet project. i wanted to emulate a joseph albers piece...but somehow its not turning out the way i thought it would. regardless, i think it will be a beautiful blanket.
now that i started this project i am so obsessed. all i want to do now is crochet.
yesterday i received tickets to the john cage retrospective. so i gave my extra ticket to john. it should be lots of fun. now i have a real excuse not to go to bottom of the hill with raul. i just had this feeling that the bands will be really scenie...
raul and i are planning a trip to seattle. its actually for his birthday. i know we'll have lots of fun with j.ron there. i should really start to look into plane tickets."

long story short we are all friends with the j-man. yup. the feud is over and we can all go on as normal again, thank the lord!!!
today i got a lot done. did laundry. oh, and i got my first order at JFF. hey, it's all about commission, i;m telling you.
do why didn't my day go south...humm...lets just say the boy doesn't get it. and so i sit here wondering...with clips of surreal-life in the background...until then silly boy with the sticks in his hand we'll try this again.

last night raul and i didn't go over to johns. i'm telling you, raul and i are stoners, and lately all we want to do is chill jazzy style. believe me it's going to stop OR mellow down a bit...it's fun though.
tomorrow is rosemarie's b-day party. i am really excited and want to get my drink on. before her party raul and i are going to another b-day party..gee, it's non-stop for my bus.

raul is gabriella from 90210. the mother/peace keeper.  however we all agreed that cory

i ended my evening with lady laura. laura is so rad. jenny got laura a smurfs blanket for x-mas, i am so jealious. 
i bruised my knee on muni this morning, ouch it hurts and i know by tomorrow it will look nasty. ugh.

so jerome called me tonight. i haven't heard from him in about a month. usually we talk every other day pretty much. well, he told me is bf stephanie/ex-girlfriend was upset at him. well of course i asked why, because i knew he was dying to tell me. well apparently jerome is seeing someone new and on a particular saturday he made plans to hang out with steph. Well that day he called steph and told her that he couldn't hang out because he was sick. well that night he hangs out with his new girlfriend/hoochie. so steph was totally pissed. and refuses to talk to him. i pretty much balled him out, saying that was totally lame of him and that considering his relationship with steph and especially their romantic passed...i mean come on. but hey it's to be expected, because guys are pretty lame like that....
sara and john are visiting joey this weekend. wow meeting the familia. i wonder how it's going??
it will be a ghostly weekend w/o them around.

"event","yesterday i hung out with heather. we went to the psychic fair, and yes i got a reading. actually i got two. one was about jen and the other was a love forecast. i have to say that the love forecast was extremly vague, and well, i took that to mean only one thing...i 'm fucked and not in the literal sense! ha! what-ev's. now as for the jen situation...i have to say the lady was right on. you see the reading that i got wasn't a tarot card reading, but instead it was an energy reading. she said my energy was a bright yellow/lime color. whatever that means. anywho, in a nut shell jen wants me to take care/ watch over her nice katrina. i was so dreading that would be the out come. i mean i kinda knew it all along. so i guess now i'm going to have to put my money where my mouth is. katrina here comes auntie jasmine...
on our way back from the psychic fair, who did i run into on the street? adam brodski. gee, i didn't see that coming. i haven't seen him in over 3 years. i didn't stop to say hi. i just continued to walk and ignored his presence. it was weird, because one moment i was retelling my reading about jen to heather and then the next moment i look up and i see adam. flashing before me at that instance were images of sfsu's library elevators and rapid copy. adam was awesome. i really cared about adam. he was interesting and fun! too bad things didn't go quite how i imagined it would with him.  i thought i'd never see him again after that year ended. so you must imagine how i was feeling when i saw him yesterday. you know what this means don't you? it means that i am going to continue to run into him. it also means he is possible back in the city from L.A. oh woe!

gee, it's been a while since i've spoken to raul. i wonder what he's been up too...Robby mentioned that he too will be applying to ccac for the fall semester. how ironic if he and i get accepted. actually it would be pretty fun.
i have a report to write up tonight, it's about the success of the koret center. it's only one page. but when i think about how many people will be reading it and especially the education committee who govern our department it makes me want to freak. well, i better get cracking!

for months now i have been thinking of a fairly new, but old, friend. i hadn't mustard up enough courage to be proactive in my endeavor's. however, this friend made it easy and just called me. i was a little nervous, because it has been some months since we had spoken as friends, or hung out. but to my surprise it was wonderful. we picked up where we left of. we were happy, as friends again, and it make me think about how much potential we really have together. to make it work in a healthy way this time. in the past it has never really lasted very long. one of use gets jealous or sensitive and then things get broken. but like i said things seemed different last night. it was such a perfect reunion that i woke up this morning, despite very little sleep, complete. thats right i felt complete. it was nice to feel good about everything again when there was so much uncertainty."

well, artist john baldissari is visiting the MOMA today along with curator robert storr. storr curated the gerhard richter exhibition, and in my opinion is one of the greatest curators. they are participating in a panel discussion on gerhard richter. i just wonder how john baldissari gets tied into this genra? he is kind of an odd one to be speaking about gerhard richter...(?)"

i'm talking to j-ron as i am writing. i love that guy! j is cute. he is so stoked that he gets to spend hi b-day and thanksgiving with his dream boy. nice.

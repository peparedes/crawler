"event","So here is the update that i promised...

Of course i couldnt sleep the night before.  I stayed at my maid of honor's house because my husband and i already had a house together and he kept my children there for me.  We got up fairly early so that we could get breakfast and have alot of time to relax that day.  We had a friend who had said that he would do our hair and makeup as a wedding gift and so we started trying to call him about 830 am and we never got ahold of him.  By 11am i was freaking out because i didnt know how i was going to get my hair and makeup done.  Then my mom came to the rescue.  She told me to get appointments at the place where i get my haircut and she would take care of it.  We got our hair done and then headed over to the place where the wedding and reception were supposed to be.  About 3pm that day we started to hear thunder which was not good considering that the ceremony was supposed to be outside, but the director of our location was very helpful and we came up with a way that we could move it all inside.  About 5pm it started raining and at that point i was very glad that we had moved everything inside.  The ceremony was supposed to start at 630pm, but it was running late because the closest thing that my husband has to a grandparent was running late.  About 7pm we finally started the ceremony and from there everything went perfect.  After the ceremony we had dinner and then dancing.  My children had a blast as did everyone else.  We went to Asheville on our honeymoon and it was great.  Since then i have spent the rest of the time putting the wedding gifts away and starting to write thank you notes.

THE MARRIED LIFE 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""It's just to hot to wear clothes today,"" said Jack as he stepped out of the
shower. ""Honey, what do you think the neighbors would think if I mowed the lawn
like this?""
""Probably that I married you for your money.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jill tells her husband, ""Jack, that young couple that just moved in next door
seem such a loving twosome. Every morning, when he leaves the house, he kisses
her goodbye, and every evening when he comes homes, he brings her a dozen roses.
Now, why can't you do that?""
""Gosh,"" Jack says, ""why I hardly know the girl.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two women are in the kitchen preparing dinner on a Friday night when one of them
looks out the window. She sees her husband coming up the walkway with a bouquet
of flowers. The woman turns to her friend and says, ""Oh, darn! He's bringing
flowers. That means another weekend on my back with my legs up in the air.""
Her friend says, ""What's the matter? Don't you have a vase?""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Honey, I have a confession to make,"" a guy told his bride. ""I'm a golf nut.
You'll never see me on weekends during golf season.""
""Well, dear,"" she murmured. ""I have a confession to make too. I'm a hooker.""
""No big deal,"" replied the groom. ""Just keep your head down and your left
arm straight.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""I'm fed up with your jealousy,"" the furious wife told her husband. ""Do you
think I don't realize you're having me followed by a detective who's tall,
blond, has green eyes and is very nice, although a little shy at first?""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He who knows nothing, knows nothing. But he who knows he knows nothing knows
something. And he who knows someone whose friend's wife's brother knows
nothing, he knows something. Or something like that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here lies my wife in earthy mould; when she lived did naught but scold. Good
friends go softly in your walking; lest she should wake and rise up talking.

Once there was a millionaire who collected live alligators. He kept them in
the pool in back of his mansion. The millionaire also had a beautiful daughter
that was single. One day he decides to throw a huge party, during the party he
announces: ""My dear guests, I have a proposition to every man here. I will give
1 million dollars or my daughter to the man that can swim across this pool full
of alligators and emerge unharmed!""
As soon as he finished his last word there was the sound of a large splash!
There was one guy in the pool swimming with all his might, the crowd cheered him
on as he kept stroking. Finally, he made it to the other side unharmed.
The millionaire was impressed, he said ""My boy that was incredible!
fantastic! I didn't think it could be done! Well, I must keep my end of the
bargain, which do you want my daughter or the 1 million dollars?""
The guy says ""Listen, I don't want your money! And I don't want your
daughter! I want the person who pushed me in that water!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After attending a party for his boss, the life of the party was nursing a
king-size hangover and asked his wife ""What the hell happened?"".
""As usual, you made an ass of yourself in front of your boss,"" replied the
wife.
""Piss on him,"" answered the husband.
""You did,"" said the wife, ""and he fired you.""
""Well, fuck him,"" said the husband.
""I did, and you go back to work in the morning.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the way home from the party, the woman said to her husband, ""Have I ever
told you how handsome and sexy and irresistable to women you are?""
""Why no,"" said the husband, flattered.
""Then what the hell gave you that idea at the party?!"" she yelled.

Old Farmer Johnson was dying. The family was standing around his bed. With
a low voice he sad to his wife: ""When I'm dead I want you to marry farmer
Jones.""
Wife: ""No, I can't marry anyone after you.""
Johnson: ""But I want you to.""
Wife: ""But why?""
Johnson: ""Jones once cheated me in a horse deal!""

I don't know how to make my wife stop buying all these gloves.
Buy her a diamond ring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having spent half the night discussing involvement vs. commitment (one of my
favorite topics when I've had a couple of glasses of wine and am feeling
particularly cranky) with my boyfriend, I was quite amused to see the following
saying pop up when I logged in the next morning:
Commitment, n.:
Commitment can be best illustrated by a breakfast of ham and eggs. The chicken
was involved, the pig was committed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One night, as a couple lay down for bed, the husband gently taps his wife on
the shoulder and starts rubbing her arm. The wife turns over and says ""I'm
sorry honey, I've got a gynecologist appointment tomorrow and I want to stay
fresh.""
The husband, rejected, turns over and tries to sleep. A few minutes later,
he rolls back over and taps his wife again.
This time he whispers in her ear, ""Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow
too?.""

Did you hear about the new men's magazine that caters exclusively to married
men? It's like Playboy or Penthouse magazine, except the centerfold is the same
month after month after month...

Correction: Instead of being arrested, as we stated, for kicking his wife down a
flight of stairs and hurling a lighted kerosene lamp after her, the Rev. James
P. Wellman died unmarried four years ago.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As he lay on his deathbed, the man confided to his wife, ""I cannot die
without telling you the truth. I cheated on you throughout our whole marriage.
All those nights when I told you I was working late, I was with other women.
And not just one woman either, but I've slept with dozens of them.""
His wife looked at him calmly and said, ""Why do you think I gave you the
poison?""

An Australian, a Frenchman and an Italian are talking about married life:
Italian: When I finish making love to my wife, I cover her head to toe in
wine, then lick it off, and my wife, she goes wild.
Frenchman: When I finish making love to my wife, I cover her head to toe in
chocolate, then lick it off, and my wife, she goes wild.
Aussie: When I finish making love to my wife, I get out of bed and wipe my
dick on the curtains, and my wife, she goes wild.

A domineering man married a mere wisp of a girl. He came back from his
honeymoon a chastened husband. He became aware of the will of the wisp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A young husband with an inferiority complex insisted he was just a little pebble
on the beach. The marriage counselor told him, ""If you wish to save your
marriage, you'd better be a little boulder.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been trying desperately to save my marriage for the last 35 years.

If all men were brothers, would you let one marry your sister?

During a fight, a husband threw a bowl of Jello at his wife. She had him
arrested for carrying a congealed weapon.
In another fight, the wife decked him with a heavy glass pitcher. She's a women
who conks to stupor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a couple sat in the living room, watching TV, the phone rang. The husband
picked it up, listened for a moment and then screamed, ""Damn it! How should I
know? Call the weather bureau!"" and hung up.
""What was that all about?"" wife asked.
""Awww, some idiot wanted to know whether the coast was clear.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three guys die and go to heaven. The first goes up to St. Peter who says, ""I
have only one question before you go into heaven: Were you faithful to your
wife?""
The guy answers, ""Yes, I never even looked at another women.""
St.Peter says, ""See that Rolls-Royce over there? That's your car to drive
while your in heaven"".
The second guy gets the same question, and answers, ""Once I strayed, but I
confessed to my wife and she forgave me and we worked it out.""
St. Peter says, ""See that new Buick over there, that's your car to use in
heaven"".
The third guy answers the same question, ""I have to admit, I chased every bit
of tail I could, and was with a lot of women.""
St. Peter says, ""Okay, but you were basically a good guy, so that old VW Bug
over there is yours to use while your in heaven. The three guys go off on their
seperate ways.
A few weeks later, guy #2 and guy #3 are driving along in the Buick when they
see guy #1's Rolls Royce parked outside of a bar. They stop and go into the bar
and find guy #1 with empty bottles all around him, face down with his face in
his hands on the bar. They come up to him and guy #2 says, ""Bud, what could
possibly be so bad-you're in heaven, you drive a Rolls Royce, and everything is
great!""
He says, ""I saw my wife today!""
The other two answer, ""That's great! What's the problem?""
He answers, ""She was riding a bicycle!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Husband: Honey, if I died, would you get remarried?
Wife: Well, I suppose so.
Husband: Would you and he sleep in the same bed?
Wife: I guess we would.
Husband: Would you make love to him?
Wife: He would be my husband then, dear.
Husband: Would you give him my golf clubs?
Wife: No. He's left handed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three kinds of sex in a marriage.
The first is Kitchen Sex. This is at the beginning of the marriage; you'll
have sex anywhere, anytime. Hence, in the kitchen.
The second kind is Bedroom Sex. You've calmed down a bit, perhaps have kids,
so you gotta do it in the bedroom.
The third kind is Hallway Sex. This is where you pass each other in the
hallway and say ""Fuck you.""
There is also a fourth kind of sex: Courtroom Sex. This is when you get
divorced and your wife fucks you in front of everyone in court.

A husband and his wife advertised for a live-in maid to cook and do the
housework. A likely-looking girl came in from the country, and they hired her.
She worked out fine, was a good cook, was polite, and kept the house neat.
One day, after about six months, she came in and said she would have to quit.
""But why?"" asked the disappointed wife.
She hemmed and hawed and said she didn't want to say, but the wife was
persistent, so finally she said, ""Well, on my day off a couple of months ago I
met this good-looking fellow from over in the next county, and well - I'm
pregnant.""
The wife said, ""Look, we don't want to lose you. My husband and I don't have
any children, and we'll adopt your baby if you will stay.""
She talked to her husband; he agreed, and the maid said she would stay. The
baby came, they adopted it, and all went well.
After several months though, the maid came in again and said that she would
have to quit. The wife questioned her, found out that she was pregnant again,
talked to her husband, and offered to adopt the baby if she would stay. She
agreed, had the baby, they adopted it, and life went on as usual.
In a few months, however, she again said she would have to leave. Same thing.
She was pregnant. They made the same offer, she agreed, and they adopted the
third baby. She worked for a week or two, but then said, ""I am definitely
leaving this time.""
""Don't tell me you're pregnant again?"" asked the lady of the house.
""No,"" she said, ""there are just too many kids here to pick up after.""

In desperation, the young bride finally wrote to Xaviera Hollander:
I'm married to a sex maniac. My husband never leaves me alone. He makes love
to me all night long - while I'm in the shower, while I'm cooking breakfast,

A mature woman was in the pastoral study counseling for her upcoming fourth wedding.
""Father, how am I going to tell my husband that I am still a virgin?""
""My child, you have been a married woman for many years. Surely that cannot be.""
""Well, father, my first husband was a psychologist, and all he wanted to do
was talk, and the next one was in construction and he always said he'd get to it
tomorrow. The last one was a gynecologist and all he did was look. But this
time, father, I'm marrying a lawyer and I'm sure I'm going to get screwed.""

Main-Squeeze Poll
No one will ever really know what makes one person fall for another. But
here is a stab at some answers from a ""main squeeze"" poll in which nearly 900
Americans were questioned about their love lives.
32% met their main squeeze through friends or relatives; 5% met at church
and only 1% met through a dating service.
Although 46% reported that personality was what first attracted them to
their sweethearts, 33% said looks counted too.
20% of the female respondents thought their main squeeze looked like Tom
Selleck, and 21% of the male respondents thought their sweethearts looked like
Sally Field.
For 70%, it was not love at first sight.

It seems that a devout, good couple was about to get married, but a tragic
car accident ended their lives.
When they got to heaven, they asked St. Peter if he could arrange for them to
be married, saying that it was what they had hoped for in life, and they still
desired wedded union. He thought about it and agreed, but said they would have
to wait.
It was almost one hundred years later when St. Peter sent for them. They
were married in a simple ceremony.
So things went on, for thirty years or so, but they determined, in this time,
that eternity was best not spent together.
They went back to St. Peter, and said, ""We thought we would be happy forever,
but now we believe that we have irreconcilable differences. Is there any way we
can get divorced?""
""Are you kidding?"" said St. Peter. ""It took me a hundred years to get a
priest up here to marry you. I'll never get a lawyer!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This day holds a lot of meaning for me. It was on this day two years ago that I
lost my dear wife and children. I'll never forget that game of cards...

Matrimony Made Easy
This is not a joke. And ""How to Marry the Man of Your Choice"" (Matrimonial
Press Report) is not a jokebook. At $95, this 167-page textbook, written by
Margaret Kent, an attorney from Key Biscayne, Florida, is subtitled ""The
Marriage Manual for Single Women."" It tells us, ""This book will teach you how
to determine what a man really wants in a wife... Consider all men living
laboratories and test the results for yourself... Start with lesser men for
training."" For those of you who can't afford the 95 bucks (never mind the $1295
for the course the book accompanies), here are a few things women don't tell
men.
On Appearance
Excessive use of perfume makes a woman less desirable. Perfumes are
manufactured from fragrances of herbs, flowers, and other substances that are
put into some medium that is strong enough to hold the odor. That medium is
often ambergris...a secretion from the intestines of the sperm whale. In other
words, you and your man may smell the odor of whale puke instead of enjoying the
fragrance of flowers or herbs.
Cleanliness is especially important. If a woman uses enough soap and has
that clean, fresh look that a recent shower gives, she could wear a potato sack
and still be desirable for her male.
T-shirts are great. It doesn't take much male imagination to know that in
less than five seconds, they are off over your head.
Food particles between the teeth, especially the front teeth, are highly
undesirable.
On Dating
If you need to pass gas (fart), excuse yourself from his presence. Try not
to destroy illusions by unpleasant odors. If you need to pass gas, face him.
If you must chew gum and smoke, do not do both at the same time.
Eat the food on your plate only. Leave his food for him.
Be a bitch, not a nag... Bitchy females get the men.
Don't pay much attention to the anger your man expresses before dinner. He
is hungry and everything bothers him.
Gourmet cooking is not required for most men. However, most women would do
better in attracting a man if they devoted a fraction of the time they spent in
learning bedroom techniques to learning kitchen techniques.
On Sex
Never deny sex, because that dooms any ideas of his marrying you.
Don't expect him to sleep on crumpled or wet sheets. If necessary, you should
sleep on the wet spot.
Do not ridicule the size of his penis or make unfavorable comparisons to
other males.
If you are overweight, it may be best if you avoid pressing down on him when
you are on top.
A typical male will lay almost any female if there are no repercussions.
Always play it safe sexually by consenting only to acts that are generally
acceptable. Place the burden of deviation upon him.
One step you can take to enhance a sexual encounter is to evoke some anger in
your male, but not furor, before sex.
After sex, the male is exhausted and has no immediate need of you as a
female... After intercourse, the man will have little energy left. Be prepared
to revive him with coffee, sweets, and appetizing snacks.
If the relationship continues to be nonsexual after an extended period of
time, the man may not be normal.
If a man suffers from premature ejaculation, just make him prolong
satisfaction slightly so he holds out an extra moment. Let us say it takes him
a minute to satisfy... Bet him that the next time you have sex, he will satisfy
in a minute and a half.
Prepare yourself emotionally for the sex act by fancying yourself in the
presence of a surrogate partner you have longed for in the past. If you have
fired up your imagination to a climactic state, your man can easily satisfy
you.
Virginity is looked upon favorably by some religious fanatics, recent
immigrants from tradition-bound societies, and men who have never had sex. The
typical male views virginity in the mature female as a curse, not a blessing.
If an adult woman tells her male that she is a virgin, he is likely to wonder
why no man has wanted her before.
On Things Women Know About Men
Men love to tell their stories! They love to tell about themselves to a
point that they become boring.
Anticipation conditions a conventional male, who was on the losing side of
the revolution, into believing he will receive something of great value in the
initial and subsequent sexual acts.
If we tell our males at six P.M. that we are lovely, they may have the
mental energy to fight off this idea... If your male is particularly tired and
exhausted, he is especially susceptible to your suggestions. His exhaustion is
especially useful for implanting the ideas of your worth, especially that you
are lovely, good, desirable, and would be the perfect wife.

A woman goes to her doctor complaining that she is exhausted all the time.
After the diagnostic tests showed nothing, the doctor gets around to asking her

The doctor advises her to cut out Wednesday.
""I can't,"" says the woman. ""That's the only night I'm home with my husband.""

A woman goes to the doctor complaining of bad knee pains. After the
diagnostic tests showed nothing, the doctor questions her, ""There must be
something you're doing that you haven't told me. Can you think of anything that
might be doing this to your knees?""
""Well,"" she said a little sheepishly, ""my husband and I have sex doggy-style
on the floor every night.""
""That's got to be it,"" said the doctor. ""There are plenty of other positions

""Not if you're going to watch T.V. there ain't,"" she replied.

When we were dating, my husband used to always tell me those three magic
words, ""I love you"". Now that we are married, those three magic words have
become, ""What's for dinner?""
When we were dating, my husband would gently rub me with hot oil while he
affectionately called me lovely nicknames. Now that we are married, he gently
rubs his car with hot wax, which now has its own pet nickname.
When we were dating, my husband would always love to watch me undress. Now
that we are married, he loves to watch championship wrestling.
When we were dating, my husband read poetry to me as he caressed me in his
arms late into the night. Now that we are married, he quotes me sports
statistics and stock prices during breakfast.
When we were dating, my husband would passionately motivate and urge me on in
whatever I did, whether it was at my job or during sex. Now that we are married,
the only thing he passionately urges on is his favorite football team.
When we were dating, my husband would make love to me on his waterbed like a
sex-starved wild beast who would go on and on. So we called the bed our ""Ocean
Of Motion Love Potion"". Now that we are married, the bed has been renamed ""The
Dead Sea"".

A woman was complaining to her best friend over lunch. ""Every time my
husband climaxes, he lets out an ear-splitting yell.""
""That doesn't sound all that bad to me,"" said her friend. ""As a matter of
fact, that would kind of turn me on.""
""It would me too,"" said the first woman, ""if it just didn't keep waking me up
and if he didn't keep moaning our daughter's name in his sleep!!""

Even though some husbands work overtime on their jobs, they still enjoy
activities back at home in the family room, especially sleeping on the couch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most husbands don't like to hear their wives struggling with housework; so they

My husband has a nautical tattoo on his stomach. It used to be on his chest,
but he dropped anchor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other day, I saw this man go into a tattoo parlor and want a tattoo of a
""hundred dollar bill"" tattoo'ed on his penis. The parlor owner said that he
could tattoo anything he wanted anywhere he wanted it! So the man got the
tattoo on his penis and while the parlor owner was doing it, he asked the man
why he wanted a ""hundred dollar bill"" tattoo'ed on his penis.
""Well"", the man answered, ""There is several reasons. Number one, I like to
play with my money!""
Well, the parlor owner said he could understand that.
Then the man said, ""The second reason is I LIKE to see my money grow!""
The parlor owner said he could understand that too!
Then the man said, ""For the third and most important reason, the next time my
wife wants to go out and blow a hundred bucks, SHE CAN STAY HOME!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Husbands don't like to gossip and air dirty laundry in public. They'd rather
drop it on the floor all over the house. Men never pick up after themselves. If
a single man drops something on the floor, it lies there until he gets married
and his wife picks it up for him. My husband will take off a dirty shirt, drop
it on the floor, and then expect it to be clean and wrinkle-free the next day
when he wears it again. Our kids grew up thinking doorknobs were made of dacron
polyester.

situation is so bad that the husband changes positions more often when he's
asleep than he does during sex, the husband doesn't go to sleep immediately
after sex but instead goes to sleep during sex, the husband really is reading
""Playboy"" just for the articles, Kim Basinger had more sex in ""9 1/2 Weeks"" than
these couples have in 9 1/2 years, and if Madonna was married to one of these
men, she wouldn't just feel like a virgin, she'd be a virgin!

Jim had an awful day fishing on the lake, sitting in the blazing sun all day
without catching a single one. On his way home, he stopped at the supermarket
and ordered four catfish. He told the fish salesman, ""Pick four large ones out
and throw them at me, will you?""
""Why do you want me to throw them at you?""
""Because I want to tell my wife that I caught them.""
""Okay, but I suggest that you take the orange roughy.""
""But why?""
""Because your wife came in earlier today and said that if you came by, I
should tell you to take orange roughy. She prefers that for supper tonight.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the only reason my husband likes to go fishing so much is that it's the
only time he hears someone tell him, ""Wow, that's a big one!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James and his wife, Martha, are getting ready to leave home for a vacation.
Martha started out the door, then stopped, turned around, and said, ""James, this
time you should go check to see if the coffee pot is off, television plugs are
pulled, lamp timers are set, thermostat is adjusted, windows are closed and
locked, burglar alarm is on, doors are locked, and I'll go wait in the car and
keep blowing the horn.""

A good husband is the light of his wife's life. But some wives are getting fed
up with seeing their lights go out every night.

took off his pants and threw them at Jeni, yelling, ""Hey, woman, can you fill
these pants up?""
""Of course not, you jerk. You know I can't.""
""You're right. You can't. I wear the pants in this family.""
So Jeni took off her panties and threw them at Tom, yelling, ""Hey, jerk, can
you get into these panties?""
""Hell no! They're too small and dainty!""
""And you won't either, until you change your treatment of me!""

A clerk was showing a lady a very nice dress shirt and tie. ""Now this,"" the
clerk said, ""is absolutely elegant. It is perfect for a man-about-town.""

louse-around-the-house.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you constantly hear a married man brag about how he runs everything around
the house, you can be sure that he is referring to the lawn mower, the car, the
errands, and the baby carriage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Six months into a marriage, a man was asked by his best friend how everything
was going. He replied, ""Oh, just fine. We practically never have any arguments.
In the morning, she does what she wants. In the afternoon, I do what she wants.
And at night, we both do what we both want.""

Watching her mother as she tried on her new mink coat, the daughter
protested, ""Mom, do you realize some poor, dumb beast suffered so you could have
that coat?""
Her mother glared back at her and said, ""Don't talk about your father that
way!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Jim and I have been married for two years now and we have not yet had our

""That has not happened yet.""

A man and a beautiful woman were having dinner in a fine restaurant. Their
waitress, taking another order at a table a few steps away, suddenly noticed
that the man was slowing sliding down his chair and under the table, but the
woman acted unconcerned. The waitress watched as the man slid all the way down
his chair and out of sight under the table.
Still, the woman dining across from him appeared calm and unruffled,
apparently unaware that her dining companion had disappeared.
After the waitress finished taking the order, she came over to the table and
said to the woman, ""Pardon me, ma'am, but I think your husband just slid under
the table.""
The woman calmly looked up at her and replied, ""No he didn't. He just walked
in the door.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One woman was asked, ""Would it kill you if your husband were to run off with
another woman?""
To which she calmly replied, ""Well, it might. They say that irrepressible
job can bring on a heart attack.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next door neighbor of a middle-aged wife came over to inform her that
her retired husband was chasing around after young prostitutes.
The woman smiled, ""So what?""
The neighbor was surprised, ""It doesn't bother you that he's running around
with those women?""
The woman replied, ""I also have a little dog who chases cars and buses, too.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sam arrived home from work early one afternoon only to surprise his wife
busily engaged with a midget in bed.
After chasing the rogue away, Sam liberally expressed his dismay to his
wayward spouse. ""I just don't know what to do with you!"" he said, shaking his
head. ""We've talked about this over and over. We've spent hours with the
marriage counselor. I was really starting to believe that I could trust you
again,"".
""I know, I know..."" acknowledged the wife contritely. ""But at least I'm
cutting back!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The man came home to find evidence that his wife had been unfaithful. ""Was
it my friend Steve?"" he yelled.
""No,"" she said.
""Was it my friend James?"" he then asked.
""What?"" she shouted. ""Don't you think I have any friends of my own?""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A woman comes home from shopping and finds her husband in bed with another
woman. The man jumps up and says, ""Honey, I can explain! As I was coming home
from the golf course, I saw this poor helpless girl on the side of the road. So
I gave her a ride and asked her where she was going. She said she had no where
to go and hadn't eaten anything in three days. I felt so sorry for her that I
brought her home and gave her something to eat. While she was eating, I noticed
she had no shoes so I gave her a pair of yours that you don't use anymore. Then
I noticed her clothes were worn, so I gave her one of your dresses that you
don't use anymore. As she was ready to leave, she turned to me and said, 'Is
there anything else your wife doesn't use anymore?'""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A husband was worried about the decline in the quality of his marriage so he
discreetly went to a marriage counselor to discuss the problem.
The counselor asked, ""Do you kiss your wife when you get home from work,
remind her every now and then of how much you love her, and show her all the
little attentions that you did during the first few years of your marriage?""
""Uhh, no, I guess not,"" the husband replied.
""That happens with many married couples,"" the counselor replied. ""I suggest
that you begin starting today to do all those little nice things for her...fuss
over her, buy her flowers, bring candy home to her, and try to be a lover again
instead of just a husband.""
""That sounds good to me. You're right. I'll start this evening.""
So when the husband got home that night, he presented his wife at the door
with a dozen long-stemmed roses, gave her a big hug and kiss and said, ""We're
going out on the town tonight, sweet lips, just the two of us and we're going to
have a *good* time. I've reserved a table at the Hilton, two seats for a great
musical to see after dinner, and that's only the beginning!""
His wife stared at him, then burst into tears. ""What! What's wrong, honey?
Tell me what's the matter?"" the husband cried.
""Well, Susie came home from high school today and told me that she's
pregnant. Then our bank called us today to tell us that five checks have bounced
and that we should immediately make a deposit. Then our cat, Mittens, got run
over by a car and poor little Katie is in her room sobbing her eyes out right
now. And I totally wrecked the car while I was trying to rush Mittens to the
animal clinic. And now...(sniff) (sniff)...now..."" she broke off and sobbed
deeply.
""Now what, honey, tell me. Please tell me."" the husband begged.
""And now, *you* come home drunk!!!!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After an argument with his wife, a man stalked out of the house. He returned
a few hours later to find his wife packing a suitcase. He angrily asked her
where she was going.
""I'm moving to Las Vegas. I can make $400-500 there doing what I give you
for free.""
The man thought about this for a moment, then pulled out his own suitcase and
began packing. His wife asked where HE was going.
""I'm going to Las Vegas, too. I want to see how you manage to live on $800 a
year.""

Gena is such a good wife. Why, just let her husband get home late at night and

provided for, didn't he?""
Laura dabbed at her eyes and muttered, ""Yes, he was a very caring husband
and he left me almost half a million dollars in his will. I miss him so much
that I'd give fifty thousand just to have him back!""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the husband came home from his job, he found his wife crying.
""Your mother insulted me, very much."" she sobbed.
""My mother? How could she do that when she's on a vacation on the other side
of the world?""
""I know. But this morning, a letter addressed to you arrived. I opened it,
because I was curious.""
""And?""
""At the end of the letter, it was written: P.S. Dear Catherine, when you've
read this letter, don't forget to give it to my son.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Husband: Now that we are married, perhaps I can point out a few of your defects.
Wife: Don't bother, dear, I know all about them. It's those defects that kept
me from getting a better man than you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""My wife is very hard to please.""
""But she wasn't always that way.""
""How do you know?""
""Why, she married you, didn't she?""

him!""

she has to do to avoid or cure it, is to be sick in bed for a day and leave her
husband to manage the household and the kids.

waiting, but only one little guy stood before the male domination gate. Albert
was undecided, so he walked up to the little guy standing all alone and asked,
""Why are you standing at this gate, a little punk like you?""
The smallish fellow replied, ""I haven't a clue. My wife told me to stand
here.""

The fortune-teller had concluded that the problem in the relationship was
Zhang's faulty organ and that the wife's only hope was to remove it so that a
new one would grow.

"event","I went back for my second fitting of my wedding dress today and it was absolutely GORGEOUS.  This is the first time that i have actually been able to zip it up.  It is the most beautiful thing that was ever made, at least i think so.  I am getting so excited about the wedding, it is right around the corner!"

"event","So i guess i will put in my first real update.  A lot has been going on.
Last week Brian bought the girls the bikes that they wanted for Christmas.  Since he wasn't home for Christmas we waited until he got home so that he could take them out shopping for the bikes.  They love them.  Caitlyn's looks like a mini chopper and Kirsten picked out one that was ""prettiful.""  Kirsten wanted one that looked like a chopper too, but they don't make them in her size so she went with the next best thing.  They both had to have a bag with their bikes.  These bags contained elbow pads, knee pads, and gloves.
School is kicking my butt like normal, but it is almost over.  Originally when i graduated in May i was going to do lateral entry and teach high school, but that has changed.  This week i decided that i wanted to go back to get my masters degree in math.  I have put in the application and given out the recommendation forms to the people that i want to fill them out.  Now all i am waiting for is to hear from the grad school to see if i got in.  I scheduled a date to take the GRE and if i am accepted to grad school it will be acceptance with a stipulation that i have to get an acceptable score on my GRE exam.  Everyone tells me that the GRE is rather simple and that i will have no problem getting the acceptable grade.
Brian got a job and he starts it Monday.  He is also talking about the idea of going to BLET school.  I have known for a while that he wanted to see about becoming a cop, but i didn't know how serious he was about the idea.  In the meantime he has been working on getting his ""new"" truck fixed so that he can take his mustang off the road to work on it so that it is how he wants it.  We still haven't heard if his reenlistment has gone through, but he seems confident that it will.
Work is work and i have discovered that nothing changed from when i worked there before.  Even though i don't like it, it is money and that is something that everyone needs.
The plans for the wedding are all falling into place, but it is hard to really put time into planning it while i am finishing school.  I am glad that we got a lot of the planning done before this semester started.  I can't believe that it is really less than 5 weeks until i am married.  I also can't wait until my mom, grandma and grandpa get into town on May 12.
Kirsten is doing great in school and i am glad that we got her into the speech class because her stuttering is all but gone.  She gets raves from her teacher all the time about how well she can read and how great of a student she is.  Caitlyn is finishing up preschool and getting excited about starting big school next year.  Her preschool graduation is on the same day as my rehearsal dinner, but i am sure that everything will work out.  Oma, g-gma and g-gpa (my mom, grandma and grandpa) will all be able to attend her graduation ceremony and she is excited about that.
I found out yesterday that Heather went into pre-term labor, but they were finally able to stop it.  She is on bed-rest now, but they are confident that they will be able to put labor off until the baby is ready to be born.
Anyways, back to cleaning and homework.  I took this weekend off so that i could make sure all my school work is in order before the last couple of weeks of school start."

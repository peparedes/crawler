"event","It's been a week since I graduated and I've been playing DotA almost everyday thanks to my friends, <lj user=""blugrey67"" /> and <lj user=""mattster55"" /> (and I do mean big thanks). Two weeks prior my graduation, I've also been playing DotA almost everyday. Today, I decide to take a break. No DotA for today. But only for today. =) 

I realized that it is also tiring to play everyday. Whenever I tell myself not to play DotA for the day, my friends would always find a way to make me play. Well, I can't also discount the fact that the kid in me really wants to play DotA. There's no one else who could stop you but yourself. Hehehe!

From the kill steals to ownage, backdoors to ganbangs and triple kills to beyond godlike, DotA does me both good and bad. Good things include making new friends and seeing them materialize offline. It also serves as a bonding session for my friends and I. It helps make me get to know my friends better as teammates. =) But DotA also can cause conflict between friends especially when it comes to kill steals. People would like to get even when a teammate fails them. But that is a rare case. =)

I decided to take a break from DotA and here I am talking about it. Maybe i should change my lj username to DotA_Addict instead. Hahaha!

On non-DotA stuff, my resume has been received by quite a number of companies already. I hope to be working by May *crosses fingers* so I'd be one person less from the unemployed workforce. =)"

As I was walking home, I can't help but reminisce what has just transpired throughout my four-year stay in college. I don't know if this exactly is the cause of my melancholy but I'm pretty sure it contributes to my being down.

I tried grabbing a snack by reheating left-overs in the fridge only to find out they're no longer fit to be eaten. Sigh. So here I am, jotting down non-sense stuff in my LJ. Looking weird. Feeling sad. Trying to discern if I should cry or not. I wanna sleep it off but it seems like my body would still like to be awake. I'm writing down things as they come to my head right now.

<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> When injured your body focuses on the wound and heals rapidly, within a few seconds. This makes you pretty much hard to kill and you can help people in danger using yourself as a shield. Almost anything is possible in combat but you prefer looking after others. In bad purposes you can do the same as above but for evil intentions.

This power fits you pretty good since you want to help those around you, and when you are pretty much unstopable, that's not an obsticle. You are caring and nurturing and are more a pascifist. Even if you know there are much unfairness in the world you still chose to see from a positive angle because you belive in the good of this world. You are probably friendly and have a soft spot for people who are not accepted. Though to others you come of as naive and gullible. You could be taken advantagde of if the wrong person comes around. Even if you could be seen as pure, you are not that completely since you're human and make mistakes too.

Last Saturday, I participated in <a href=""http://compsat.org"">CompSAt</a>'s sportsfest. I finally got to play badminton again. My team mate and I landed second place in the tourney, losing to the alumni. Evening that day, I went to <lj user=""arbi_ibra"" />'s house for his birthday bash. Invited were our other course mates. We did not exactly party but more of ate, mongolian style. =) And being the bad guest that I am, I ran up his room and played DotA on Battle.Net after I finished eating. >:) bwahahaha! Actually, I was one of the first ones to arrive there and I asked <lj user=""arbi_ibra"" /> if I could play on Battle.Net while waiting for the others. One surprising fact I discovered during my first game is that the Necrolyte's Heartstopper Aura could actually kill an enemy hero. =P

This week will seem to go by silently since I only have a Theo LT waiting to beat on me on Thursday. By now, I'm no longer used to having a week that is not hellish in nature, academically speaking.

To supplement their report, they showed the movie Grave of the Fireflies. I was finally able to finish it (sorry <lj user=""aznpoptart"" />. at least the sad movies are off our list of dvds to watch =P). I kinda guessed how it's gonna end. But I didn't expect it to end the way the film ended. It made me cry. I'm not the type who cries when watching emotion-heavy films but this one is really different. It really made me cry even if I was feeling blizzard-cold in the viewing room. I even had to pretend I'm doing some stretching just to create an excuse on why my eyes are red and watery. Sad, sad, sad... Cry, cry, cry... =(

Sagala ng mga Sikat was held at school today too. This event showcased the different fictional characters in Filipino literature that has made an impact on Filipino culture presented through the use of <i>arkos</i> similar to those in Flores de Mayo events. Some of the characters presented there were Sister Stella L, Pugad Baboy, Maria Clara, Flerida, Phathuphats, Annie Batumbakal, Mr. Suave, Maria Makiling and guess who, Zsa Zsa Zaturnnah! =) Winner ang presentation nila. Award na Award talaga! =P 

The Sagala went on smoothly. I envy those kids for having the chance to do such a project. I wish we, as students, also had the chance to do something similar to that. From doing a concept paper to execution, then preparation of <i>arkos</i> or floats to short skits or presentation, it would have been fun. Oh well... At least I enjoyed their projects. It would have been fun to watch with friends too. Unfortuntely, they had other things to do (beh! it's your loss! =P). Hehehe!"

A: Basta 'yun. Boneless bangus.

Waiter: Yes, sir?

Saturday night, <a href=""http://zippydidoodah.blogspot.com"">Zippy</a>, <lj user=""jonquil1223"" /> and I went to Star City. With us was <lj user=""jonquil1223"" />'s younger sister, Camille. She's actually the sponsor of the trip. She treated each of us to a ride-all-you-can ticket to the amusement park. Hahaha! Thank you Camille! =)

On the way to Star City, I felt a bit excited to return to the place that gave meaning to my very first concept of what a theme park is all about. I reminisced the first time I went there with my parents, my next sibling older than me and my youngest brother. We parked meters away from premises since it was so hard to get a parking slot. I vividly recall my very first ride-all-you-can ticket, yellow in color that costs 300+ pesos. My first roller coaster love is the Wacky Worm. I recount ""begging"" the manong not to let me off the ride since no one else was in line for a new run of the roller coaster. That was the ride I repeated riding the most. I feared the Wild River, I thought it was too high. But I got to ride it still, last though, just before we left. Alcatraz was scary being the kid I was, but I liked it. It did scare the wits out of me especially with those people in costumes chasing and scaring people away. Effective indeed. I did not ride the Zyklon Loop. I just marveled at how brave my older brother was to ride it. The Zyklon Loop used to be the most ferocious roller coaster ride in the country. How I so loved Star City... then came Enchanted Kingdom. But that's besides the point. =P

Upon our return to the fabled Star City, I was saddened at how it has transformed from being a Betelgeuse to a white dwarf... The Star has lost its grandeur and shine. Upon entry to the theme park premises, a malodorous smell would welcome you--it reminded me of stinking fish. Aside from that, construction materials are dumped in piles here and there. Unused gondolas reek with stagnant water. But at least this time, it's so much easier to park. 

When we got to the theme park entrance, there was just so much people in line. Good thing we were able to get our tickets from a window that seemed rather unnoticed by people. I was surprised to see that Star City is no longer the open-air amusement park that it used to be. The covered area is now air-conditioned though the foul smell still lingered. Tiangge stores and kiosks are everywhere too. There are more rides such as the Wacky Dragon (how original), Flying Carpet, Viking (Fiesta Carnival, anyone?), Blizzard and the Enterprise-like ride. 

What I really didn't like were the people. There was just too many of them--and they acted so oddly too. I saw someone stand on top of the steel railings (take note: on top, not just on the railings). The same person even held on and forcefully tried to wiggle the cable that connects the ride to some mechanism. A lot of people don't seem to know the concept of lifespace--whenever I'd move to keep distance from people, other people think you're moving so they can get closer to the ride, queue-wise. Some would even touch and hold on to you even if they don't know you. There was this little girl that kept on touching us. She held on to my shirt, my pants, my pocket and even my arms! How audacious! Kulang na lang yakapin niya ako! Other people even had the guts to go over the steel railing to cut in line. Sigh. I really feel sad at how Star City and most especially the people who go there have become. Waiting in line for 30 minutes or more is very understandable for a theme park that has lots of patrons, but the rides there are not worth the wait plus having to be with people who act so rowdily.

I have nothing against Star City going masa. I just feel sad with its current plight. With the park getting neglected, I can't help but rationalize why people like those I stated above come to Star City. The park's magic of ""making dreams come true"" has dissipated. It is now just another commercial theme park.

Buti na lang talaga, may Enchanted Kingdom: Where the magic begins. =P

Kahapon, nawindang ako sa Theo orals ko. Ok na sana ako. Kaya lang, dahil sa sobrang galing ng mga nakasabay ko sa waiting room, naglahong parang mga bula ang lahat nang inaral ko. Nakakadead sila sa tindi nilang mangabisa. Arghness sila. Kaya nang turn ko na para sa orals, ayun, unang tanong pa lang feeling ko paglalamayan na ako. Kaya pala paulit-ulit ang parehong tanong dahil may hinihintay siyang sabihin ko. Malamang hindi ko nasabi yung gusto niyang marinig kaya sabi niya, <i>"" Nasa tamang direksyon ka naman eh, medyo naguguluhan ka lang.""</i> Halluer! Siyempre ang totoong salin niyan ay <i>""Kanina ka pa paikot-ikot. Mali ka. Akala mo hindi ko nahalatang nang-e-air raid ka, in hopes na matamaan mo ang tamang sagot?""</i> Oh well... at least, nakuha ko ang pangalawang tanong nang tama. May itinanong pa siya matapos ang dalawa pero ukol sa klase na. Ano daw masasabi ko sa aming klase. Siyempre, kailangan bumawi kaya inokray ko sila. Hahaha! Pero hindi naman talaga... criticisms lang ang binitiwan ko. =P Hehehe!

Kinuwento ko sa mga kaibigan ko ang nangyari. At dahil gusto ko lang mawala yung panlulumo ko, taas noo kong sinabi, <i>""I'm expecting a B+!""</i>. O di ba, winner! Di ko pa ginawang A. Ang tanging nasabi nila, ""Ang taas ng self-esteem, grabeh!""

Kanina nagkalong test ulit kami, CS naman. As usual, first three items pa lang, gusto ko nang tumayo at magpasa ng paper. Pero ang totoong saloobin ko, gusto ko talagang magwalk out sa pagkawindang. 5 out of 9 items lang ang sigurado ako. Death na talaga 'to.

Bukas, Philo long test naman (na nakaligtaan kong maalala) at Theo long test! Saan ka pa? May orals na, may written pa! Di lang yan, may 30 page reading din kami for History. Natatakot akong baka magulantang kami ng isang bulagang pagsusulit. 'Di pa diyan nagtatapos ang lahat, buong sabado ng Agosto, kailangan nasa pamantasan ako dahil sa isang math org project.

I'm the next walking dead."

"event","Morning i had to wake up very early so i'd be able to work on my the requirements needed for the yearbook. Deadline was 3:00 pm in the afternoon. If you don't beat the deadline even by a minute, you have to pay an additional Php 200 late fee. Argh. Good thing I got there like 2:56 pm. Hahaha! Talk about buzzer beater. I would have gotten there in time if I didn't run up the 88-step stairs at the shortcut going to school. And upon stepping onto school grounds, i took a tricycle ride going to a place i could walk to in just 10 minutes. But time was really of the essence so I really opted to go for a ride. And I had to have some things printed pa. Then, i ran (as in run!) going to the collection venue. Nakakadead talaga 'yun. Umulan pa pala. Good thing that I was inside the FX going to school when it rained. I was even praying that the rain would stop before I get down, or else my envelope would get wet along with other important documents in it. Know what, it did stop a few minutes before I got down the FX. Divine intervention? =)

I then attended my org's first General Assembly. Friends ko naman ang Executive Board kaya hindi na ako nakinig. Hahaha! Feeling officer din ako actually. I just went there for the food. Dami kasi laging food kapag GA. Of course, the org didn't fail me. Sangkatutak talaga ang pagkain. I didn't eat much of the palabok though. 'Yung dewberry tarts lang nilantakan ko. =P

I went to megamall alone after. I asked my friends if they would want to go with me but they said they have other commitments already. I bought a few things then watched Pinoy Blonde. Very nice film. <i>Hindi [nga talaga] ito typical pinoy movie.</i> I suggest you guys see it for yourselves. Enjoy ang kakaibang pagkakagawa sa pelikula.

After the film, I left for home. But when I was in cubao na, <lj user=""tenziltech"" /> called up. I was even hesitant in answering his call. Using your cellphone at the sakayan in edsa corner aurora in cubao is like being very very very generous. I answered the call nevertheless. May lakad daw sa greenhills. Tutal rush hour pa at mahirap sumakay pauwi, pumunta na lang akong greenhills (Yehey! Marunong na akong pumunta doon ng commute). <lj user=""tenziltech"" />, <lj user=""cuteshox"" />, <lj user=""mattster55"" /> and I ate dinner at Good Earth in Promenade. Food was delish! <lj user=""blugrey67"" />, <lj user=""shujin88"" /> and Ian arrived not long after we're done eating. We then transferred and hung out at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. We had fun discussing things, exchanging banters and laughing at (some good and some corny) jokes.

By 2:00 am, we all had to leave. But <lj user=""tenziltech"" />, <lj user=""cuteshox"" />, <lj user=""mattster55"" /> and I were headed to <lj user=""tenziltech"" />'s place pa to play GameCube. I never played the GameCube before and I'd say it really is addicting! Hehehe! We played Mario Kart and it was oh so fun!!! I didn't like the race part kasi I always lost. Hahaha! <lj user=""cuteshox"" /> was always the victor in the race mode. But when we played battle mode na, guess who won! Hehehe! 4:00 am we had to stop na or we might catch the rising sun. Hahaha! <lj user=""tenziltech"" /> with <lj user=""mattster55"" /> and <lj user=""cuteshox"" /> drove me to the far recess of NCR called Marikina. Awwwe. Thanks <lj user=""tenziltech"" />! =)

I really had a great weekend. The recent week may not have been so nice to me in general but its culmination makes all the bad things drift away. Thanks to all my friends. =)"

"event","I have recently learned to love Ping Pong. I call it Ping Pong because I did not undergo any formal training in playing the sport as well as I'm not so good in playing it too. Table Tennis players or fanatics (if there are any around) might feel violated if I even dare attempt to call my games Table Tennis.

I really like playing racquet sports. I play lawn tennis, table tennis and badminton. I just play them for fun. 'Yung tipong laru-laro lang talaga. Baka kasi ma-bore ang kalaban ko kung masyado siyang magaling kaya madalas umuurong o tumatanggi ako kapag medyo nararamdaman kong magaling sila maglaro. 
<lj-cut text=""Let's play tennis!"">
<b>Lawn Tennis</b>
During my elementary and high school years, my intrams (intramural game) was Lawn Tennis. Back then (and until now actually), I didn't know how to play the sport. IIRC, nangahas lang akong maglawn tennis kasi feeling ko madaling lang maglaro at pakiramdam ko noon sapat na nanonood ako ng mga games nila Sampras, Hingis at Philippoussi sa cable tv ng kapitbahay namen para maging qualified ako maglaro ng lawn tennis. I remember that our team never won any game except when it was by default. I also recall a time when the referee even shouted, ""Lagyan niyo naman ng buhay ang laro niyo!"" during one of my matches against another section. But in all fairness, my teammates and I once bagged the second place medal and in a different school year, the third place medal in Lawn Tennis. I'm sure you've guessed it by now, winner by default. Hahahahaha! =)
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""How about badminton?"">
<b>Badminton</b>
I already loved badminton even before it became a fad. I recall my fist ""street badminton"" experience wherein my mother brought home a badminton set which she purchased for less than a hundred bucks at the local market. I was 9 years old then. It includes two badminton rackets and 2 defomed shuttlecocks. It took me quite a while to get the hang of playing the game. I remember the subpar rackets that always got the shuttlecock stuck instead of returning it to the other player. I knew I hit the shuttlecock and when I start to look for where it went, I'd be surprised to see it stuck on the racket head dislodging the low-tension, loosely woven strings. Hahaha! I played then with my mom or my brothers. In school (grade school and high school), nobody was into the game as much as I am, thus, no opponent meaning no badminton game for me. While i was sitting on the bleachers in our covered court, holding a badminton racket in one hand and a shuttlecock on the other, I'd just stare at the people who are so engrossed with playing Basketball or Volleyball. Rare times would I find someone willing to play the sport with me. And whenever I do, I'd really savor the moment, playing to my heart's content even if my opponent isn't really too serious with the game.

Cut to the present. Now that the badminton is all popular, finding courts for rent every 10 blocks or so in the metro, I have found some peeps to play it with. Most of the time with my school barkada and sometimes with my brothers. But I don't get to play it often still. Too busy with school stuff plus the hassle of bringing badminton paraphernalia and not to mention the expensive rates for renting a taraflex, concrete or tabla court. In a way, the preparations, so to speak, for playing badminton are quite a hassle though I really love playing it. Actually, there's a badminton court just right at the entrance of our subdivision. My house is just near so no problem with bringing much badminton stuffies and in addition to that, their rates are relatively lower. The only problem now are the players. My brothers usually can't find the time to play with me while my friends still consider Marikina a province (even though it has been declared a city like years ago), thus, they won't come over. When my brothers do find the time to play and ask me whether I would want to play with them or not, of course I definitely can't say no. Sometimes, I'd even cancel scheduled activities just to get a chance to play! Hahaha! Oh well... I'd still want to play despite the hassle. If I really want it, I could find millions of ways to do it. =)
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Table tennis is interesting too..."">
<b>Table Tennis</b>
When I was younger, like 12 or so, I was fascinated by table tennis. I marveled at how the ball varies its speed, direction and altitude in such a small, green, rectangular table where the players assumed quite funny-looking stances. I tried to play it but my racket hold was so panget I looked lanky. The ball went everywhere too every time I'd hit it. I actually don't know how the hell I learned the basics of playing the game. I just realized one day, I could actually play the game though not as well as well-trained players. Maybe just like lawn tennis, merely watching people play helped. Good thing mom asked one of the carpenters who were renovating the house last year to make a table tennis set: the wooden stands and the playing board itself. When the set was fairly new, we used to play everyday. Until we went sawa from playing it.

A while ago, I was already planning to write down something for this lj entry. Knowing that Jay-Jay, my younger brother has table tennis as PE in U.P. Manila, it caused me to ask him to play with me, thus, I quit typing the entry. He then immediately agreed to play with me (of course! he's enthusiastic whether he could use the things or techniques taught to them at school against me. it's his chance to defeat kuya! NOT! =P). We played for an hour and a half. We were both perspiring and feeling ngarag not from actually having rallies for score but from chasing the ball around every time it went to a direction it wasn't intended to go. Mahirap at nakapapagod sobra magpulot you know. I didn't notice that all the tension and stress that was pouncing on me this week had already been already while we were playing. I'm loving ping pong now... I guess this will be a every other day thing for us... hopefully! =)
</lj-cut>

*Sigh* Pasensya na sa mahabang entry... inabot mo na ang ganito kalayo, meaning you love and enjoy being tortured! Hahaha! I actually just planned on writing just a short paragraph. But I seem to have written down an entry with length comparable to Ate Charo's letters in MMK. =P"

"event","So many things have been happening in my life right now. I even think that's still an understatement. I wanna jot them all down but as usual, I get too overwhelmed at the task ahead. I know lj-ing about them is a good outlet to somehow release the tension building up inside but I'm no good writer and I'm not the type who tries to organize my thoughts before I write. I do know I write more effectively when I just babble, ramble and rant all I want. Then again, being an effective writer is different from being a good one. Oh well, I'm mindlessly blabbering again.

I really wanna write down all my ideas, the latest happenings in my life, my day-to-day raves and other stuff I could only possibly dream to write down here. Alas, all I'm left to write down is this joke I got from a nodding acquaintance I accidentally bumped into at the school cafetria. I already forgot who introduced me to her. And I was actually touched that she, being just an acquaintance, wanted to one day sit down, talk with me and update each other on the latest buzz in our lives. In her own words, ""Isang araw kwentuhan naman tayo. Wala na akong balita sa'yo eh. Intrigahin mo buhay ko. Hahaha!""

'Di ko alam kung matutuwa ako o ano sa last sentence niya. Haaay... Anyway, here goes her joke. Preloader lang pala, the joke is not so timely since I'm already in my senior year and the joke also happens to cater to CS or other related courses only. Oh well, wutever!

<lj-cut text=""The Shift"">
""Balita ko magshishift ka raw [ng course]?""
""Ah hindi. Naka Caps Lock na ako eh.""
</lj-cut>

Nang marinig ko yan, hindi ko alam kung maiiyak ba ako, hahalakhak, ngingiti, hahagulgol, magkukunwaring natatawa o magtutumbling tapos tutulay sa alambre. Pero dahil mabait siya sakin at wala pa akong biases sa kanya, in all fairness, napabungisngis ako at napangiti (parehong genuine 'yun, hindi tupperware).

<a href=""http://soundlessfootsteps.blogspot.com"">Yesha</a>'s blog has now been half-resurrected. Nagmumulto na kasi ang drama ng blog niya kaya half lang ang pagkakarevive. In a way, dead na rin ang akin. May entry updates nga but the LJ would still make do without it. Argh."

"event","i have always been advising my friends never to oversleep because oversleeping is as detrimental as getting too little sleep. it makes one feel very restless (as if he did not sleep) and cranky, that is aside from getting headaches. last night, i slept 12 hours. ayan... masakit ang ulo ko, 'di ko malaman ang gagawin ko at out of focus ako. argh.

<lj-cut text=""don't click me yet"">
i wanna backtrack to what happened to me after the unfortunate incident regarding the footspas and the ""my very own rain"" incident.

i thought things could not get any worse than what had happened to me. i was wrong. dead wrong. the following day (this is the continuation of my previous post), i woke up the usual time. took a bath, fixed up and left the house at 8:20 am. actually 30 minutes would suffice to get me to school but i alloted an extra 10 minutes to ensure i wouldn't be late due to the traffic that, again, the construction in front of our subdivision would bring about. my class is at 9 and i had a presentation  to do. actually, wala pa akong presentation. gagawin ko pa lang 'pag dating ko sa class kasi panghuli naman akong magpepresent. i thought my plan was perfect. i know i surely can create that presentation in a matter of minutes during class. so i waited nonchalantly (still using an unbrella of course) for an fx ride at the ""new-usual"" place. 8:30 passed... then 8:35... 8:40... i was already getting irritated. i know that by standing there for at least 20 minutes, i'd be able to get a ride already. that day was different. 8:50 na wala pa rin. so i texted Vannie (o ayan, hindi na Yesha) and politely asked her if she could create my presentation, that is, i'd text her the details and she would take care of the implementation. i know it was too big a request not to mention a very troublesome task especially that it is a programming presentation but i was already desparate. when she replied, i sensed hesitation, thus, i felt hanging not knowing whether she was okay with it or not. 9:00 i was already fidgeting. i was already moving from one spot to another to at least ease the tension building up in me. 9:10-9:20, nanggigigil na ako. everytime i receive a reply from <lj user=""tenziltech"" /> (whom i am very thankful for 'cause if it weren't for him, i would have broken down then), gusto ko nang durugin 'yung cellhpone ko sa inis sa mga nangyayari sa akin. same goes with my payong. if you were someone standing behind me, you'd notice that my umbrella shakes from time to time. i was trying to crush the handle of the umbrella (as if i can) as a form of stress buster causing it to shake.
</lj-cut>

sa tingin ko, ang muling paglalahad ng mga nangyari sa akin noong mga nakalipas na dalawang araw ay magiging pabigat 'di lamang para sa akin kundi pati na rin sa mga mambabasa. napagdaanan ko na yaon at siyempre ayaw ko nang danasin pang muli kahit sa alaala man lang. masaya na ako na tapos na iyong mga pangyayaring iyon, maligaya ako at nagagawa ko na siyang tawanan sa tuwing binabalik-balikan ko iyon, at higit sa lahat, nagagalak ako at nandito ako ngayon na walang inaalala kahit pansamantala lamang. =)

Thursday had not been very nice (and i do mean <b>un-nice</b>!) to me save that of watching the play <b>Mr. 80%</b>. It's a comedy about being gay, straight ang faking it. It wasn't great. It was fantabulous! And extremely hilarious too! I urge you guys to watch it. It's still showing 'till July 1... =) 

Here's one of those lines i can't forget from the play: ""You're (refering to Patricia) a bisexual, I'm (Jan, a guy, speaking) a bisexual, we'd make a quadrosexual!"" =))

Friday was fun. I went out with Roger, a good friend. He's from makati but that day, he had some business in QC to attend to. Since I'm within the area, he asked me if i could go. Why not? I could use company especially on a friday night without a gimmick. =) Hehehe! He went shopping for today's big event. ;p After which, we went to watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith in Galleria. Finally! Napanood ko rin. Unlucky me, medyo inaantok antok ako sa movie house dahil sa pagod at lamig na rin. But I enjoyed the movie so much. Ang dami nga lang cut sobra. Grrr!

A funny thing happened to us before we went to Galleria. Roger had to meet up with his ""friend"" in Gateway kasi nakatunog na nasa QC area siya. Nang nandoon na kami at nakita na namin ang ""friend"" niya, siguro wala pang 10 minutes humiwalay na kami sa ""friend"" niya. Ang sobrang nakakatawa pa kung paano ""nagpaalam"" si Roger. Parang ganito yung conversation (note: kakikita pa lang namin sa ""friend"" ni Roger)...

...
Roger's Friend: gusto n'yo samahan n'yo na lang akong kumain...
Roger: actually manonood kaming sine... Mr. & Mrs. Smith... gusto mong sumama?
RF: ay napanood ko na 'yun eh...
R: gusto mong panoorin <b>ulit</b>? (may stress sa ulit)
RF: napanood ko na yun eh... mag-isa nga lang ako nun.... anong oras ba?
R: actually, <b>ngayon na</b>!
...

Go figure! Bwahahahahaha!!!

So here I am now. Struggling still with my headache which is getting ""heavier"" and ""heavier"" by the minute. Hahaha! May party pa akong pupuntahan later. Na-uh! Not tonight's big party event. Hehehe! It's a kabarkada's party. I'm having problems though. Mukhang hindi pupunta mga iba kong kabarkada. Wala akong kasama pumunta plus hindi ko rin maalala na kung paano pumunta sa bahay ng kabarkada kong iyon. Hehehe! A basta... Come what may... Ganyan naman ako lagi...

Eat na ako... It's 3 pm and I haven't eaten breakfast nor lunch. =)

You could click on the lj-cut now to see what I didn't continue on working. =) Out of focus nga kasi!"

"event","i'm filled with so much angst kaya 'wag makikialam sa kung paano ako magsusulat.

what a crappy week. it ain't over yet but it has brought me nothing to smile about save a very few instances that sorta cheer me up. oh well, argh pa rin talaga!

i've got tons of school work to do. academic requirements, senior year preparations, org stuff and other what-nots. argh! 

i also have to attend to my personal life especially regarding relationships, be it past, future or still budding. my friends make me happy naman. my close friends make me feel content. i do receive messages from time to time that ease my worries though just temporary. i also get messages at the start of the day, which ruins it. like kanina. ang aga aga, nambubwisit na agad. ako na nga ang nagmamagandang loob, siya pa may ganang magalit. di lang 'yun, iniwanan pa akong nakabitin. argh! super aga ng araw emotionally disturbed na ako. argh ka! eto ka! *um!*

i too have to deal with the ever and super changing weather. one moment its so so hoooottt, the next moment, you see the roads get covered by raging currents and pools of mud. argh talaga! i even do things now just for the welfare of my body (and face na rin). like every morning, i'd use an umbrella walking out the subdivision and while waiting for a ride to school. take note that i'm the only guy there who uses an umbrella to protect my skin from getting oh-so-dark from the tremendous heat of the sun while some girls there don't even use one. tapos i bought this violet abaniko to use kapag mainit sa labas, sa classroom, sa tambayan or even while walking. oh well, kebs lang. basta i care for myself.

sobra na talaga itong pabagu-bagong panahon. kahapon akala ko malala na ang nangyari sa akin. sobrang init nang umaga tapos noong hapon na, biglang bumuhos ang napakalakas na ulan. nasa eastwood pa kami noong umulan at pabalik na sana ng school. napalibre pa ako ng footspa (translation: nababad ang paa ko sa tubig na naipon sa kalye). buti na lang naka tsinelas ako (na hightech sabi ng reebok) pero wala namang kwenta... pero hindi pa diyan nagtatapos yan. mas malala 'yung nangyari kanina. late na naman ako umuwi as usual dahil sa dami ng school work. ok naman 'yung panahon nung paalis na ako ng school. pero 'pag apak na 'pag apak ko sa labas ng building, umulan. ay hindi pala. bumagyo. akala ko kakayanin ng payong ko kaya ginamit ko iyon at nangahas na maglakad papunta sa karaniwang dinadaanan ko pauwi. wala pang 20 na hakbang ang nagawa ko, napabalik ako sa building. sa wala pang 20 na apak na 'yun, basa na (at talagang basang-basa) agad ang pantalon, t-shirt at bag ko. argh!!! kaya malamang naghintay akong medyo tumila ng konti ang ulan. noong medyo ok ok na, sumugod na ako gamit ang hamak kong payong. paminsan-minsan, tumitigil ako sa mga lugar kung saan maaari akong sumilong kapag lumalakas na nang sobra ang buhos ng ulan. tapos makikipagsapalaran ulit kapag medyo tumila na nang kaunti. dahil nga malakas sa karaniwan ang ulan at ang pamantasang aking pinapasukan ay hitik sa lupa at mga puno, ang raging river sa mga kalsada dun, kulay brown. kaya 'yung footspa ko kanina, may kulay. buti na lang ulet nakatsinelas ako. hay. inisip ko na lang may exfoliating powers ang kulay brown na ""mini ilog"". kaya ayun. naglalakad ako with free footspa. tapos bigla na lang akong nakaramdam ng patak ng tubig sa ulo ko habang nakapayong na naglalakad. akala ko ulan lang na ""aksidenteng"" nakalusot sa payong ko. noong medyo naramdaman kong napapadalas na ang bagsak ng mga patak, kinapa ko ngayon ang payong ko. at aba! ang walang kwentang payong ko, tumutulo!!! hindi water proof!!! saan ka nakakita ng ganoon di ba? saan?!? kaya isipin mo na lang... naglalakad ako na basa ang pantalon, t-shirt at bag na may libreng footspang may kulay tapos may ""sariling ulan"" sa ibabaw ng ulo. ang saya saya di ba?!?! at least ngayon, alam ko na pakiramdam ng mga tauhan sa cartoons kung saan mayroon silang sariling raincloud na nagpapaulan sa kanila. siyempre ligo agad ako nang makauwi ako.

sino ba namang hindi magkakasakit sa mga nangyayari sa buhay ko? mainit palabas ng bahay. malamig sa fx (na minsan impyerno rin pala). mainit papasok ng pamantasan. malamig sa silid-aralan. mainit pag break. malamig ulit sa silis-aralan. mainit palabas ng pamantasan. malamig sa fx pauwi... tapos ang 'pang winner diyan, puyat ako gabi-gabi. stress to the google degree of infinity na 'to!

A friend of mine failed me for the ""m raised to the nth time"" a few days back. I should have seen it coming. He has done that a lot of times in the past but I gave him the benefit of the doubt after he explained why he wasn't able to comply with our deal. I was so stupid to have given him my trust again. He's such an asshole. Surprisingly, i feel more pity rather than anger for him.


Lunch

It was my first time to eat lunch alone in Makati. Late lunch in fact, about 3 or 4 pm. The feeling's weird 'cause I always had someone to accompany me whenever I eat (except at home). I ate at Jollibee located along Ayala. I ordered food, looked for an isolated spot and ate. I looked around the place but all i saw was my food and the print ads on the walls. I seem to have blocked myself off from anything that does not concern me. After I'm done, I went out the store and walked towards the building where I ""work,"" seeing only the pavement where I walk on.

Seeing is different from looking. You can always look but never get see. For one always <b>chooses</b> to see. Two people can look at the picture the same way but see rather different images.

I was surprised to see that one of those pringles cans which i bought (just for those fancy watches) was being ""ant-ed"" (bwahahaha! translation: nilalanggam! =p) And what was more striking, 'yung hot and spicy ang nilalanggam! Malalakas ang loob ng mga langgam na 'yun. I was supposed to bring it out and leave it under the heat of the sun to kill the ants. But that would be at the pringles' crispiness' expense. So I just let them mind their own business in hopes that they would contract almuranas from feasting on spicy food. The next day, when I opened the can, they're all dead. Bwahahahahaha! The funny thing is, I still ate it. I just dusted the ants off. Sabi nila pampaganda daw ng boses ang mga langgam. This might be my chance. =P


<a href=""http://soundlessfootsteps.blogspot.com"">Yesha</a>

I received a text from Yesha last night. Akala ko naman kung ano. She texted an accident este incident pala that happened to her while on the way to Lipa. She reminded me of a salagubang. Hahaha! O ayan ha, di na kita pinre-empt. Hahayaan kitang ikaw na magkwento. Ililink na lang kita! Bwahahaha!

P.S.
Last day ko na sa OJT ngayon... Awwwe..."

Here's what my pig says about me:

<b>Toward the middle, you are a realist.</b>

<b>Facing front, you are direct, enjoy playing devil's advocate and neither fear nor avoid discussions.</b>

<b>With many details, you are analytical, cautious, and distrustful.</b>

<b>With 4 legs showing, you are secure, stubborn, and stick to your ideals.</b>

<b>The size of the ears indicates how good a listener you are.</b>
<b>The bigger the better. You drew medium sized ears, you are a good listener</b>

<b>The length of the tail indicates the quality of your sex life.</b>
<b>And again more is better! You drew medium sized tail</b>

<lj-cut text=""The Bus"">
First Stop: The Bus 

I hate the ongoing construction along J.P. Rizal Street which is just right in front of the subdivision where we live in. I don't know why they're digging just now especially that it has started raining already. I don't even know what excatly they're doing. It could be road improvement, road renovation, road beautification, just plain digging or simply just wrecking the streets for fun to create excitement for the PUVS and private transport as well. In all fairness, the patok Montalban jeeps are no longer so patok. They can no longer drive at 80 kph moving like sidewinders on a two-lane street. Hahaha! And for the FX drivers, they at least get to have 10-minute naps whenever they stop to wait for their turn to traverse a what used to be two-lane street. Hali-halili 'ika nga ng sign dun sa may riverbanks (nyak! connect?!?). 

Now what irritates me most is that the PUVS, particularly the FXes, going to Cubao no longer pass by our subdivision. Every morning, they are re-routed to some liblib na eskinita behind our subdivision. Now I don't want to go waiting for a ride there as I might not get back home with my stuff and myself na rin intact. That detour is located in a community known to house muggers and snatchers. O ang saya di ba? =) Going back to what I was saying, FXes and even jeeps no longer pass by the front of our subdivision. Grrr! The good thing is (or is it a bad thing?), buses are the only ones allowed to still traverse J.P. Rizal because they might wreck the houses at the bangketa of the community because it is liblib nga and it is an eskinita! Sana doon na lang sila pinadaan. =) Oh well, I have no choice but take a bus ride to Concepcion (thank God that's only like 1.5 km from our place). Now riding a bus has a lot of major drawbacks, most especially the non-aircon ones. Here's a list: 

     <li>It takes 48 years for them to arrive at the place you want to go to.</li>
     <li>It stops at every person the driver sees on the sidewalk.</li>
     <li>You collect all the dust from the street making you feel sympathetic towards the undusted furnitures in an old house unvisited for years.</li>
     <li>A lot of pickpocketers and bag slashers are known to frequent buses to spot victims.</li>
     <li>And (this is my favorite) by the time you get off the bus, you instantly have free foundation! Straight from the dusty streets of the Metro! Very natural di ba? At effortless pa! Yuck! :-&</li>

Oh well, I hope they do finish the construction soon. And I do mean very soon. Akala ko pa naman ligtas na ako. Pasukan na nga pala next week! Grrr! Ayoko na magbus!!!!! </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Cheapipay Watches"">
Second stop: Fancy Watches 

I have this knack for fancy watches or even just watches that look fancy, unique or eccentric. Remember those McDo watches? I have all four though the white and red ones are with somebody else na. I love those Nike Presto watches! It was supposed to be a gift for me last Christmas by my parents. Oo nga no? What happened to that na? I have to make singil! Hahaha! Even those Swatch watches, especially Swatch Skin, makes me say to myself, ""when I'm already working, I'll splurge in buying those watches that look so funky."" Oh well, right now, I just have to settle for cheapipay watches, be it an immitation, a freebie or just plain cheap. Hahaha! My current kinalolokohan would be these free watches from pringles. They come in five colors: red, green, black, blue and violet. So far I only have the first three.

Here they are.

I love watches like these. Very simple and casual. =)

Give me until the end of the week and I'll be able to acquire the blue and violet ones na. Hahaha! </lj-cut>

It's my little brother's first day in college today. He left the house at 5:30 am for his 7:00 am class. He studies in UP Manila. Hope he does well. I'm happy for him. I love my little brother so much even though I don't get to show it to him vocally. =)

I love my mom too. Very very much! =) That goes for my father as well. I love my family! =)

Enough agitation Phippo. Tell the story of how you became an instant 18 roses-er in a debut where you don't personally know the debutant.

<lj-cut Text=""Receive a Rose"">
This happened just last night. That debut would really be an experience I won't forget. Yesterday afternoon, I was already panicking because it seems like no one is going to be available to bring Yesha and me to Jade Palace. Good thing that dad, even if he just arrived from Thailand, is still the loving father I know of and offered to drive me and my friend there. I was having second thoughts though for it seemed like he really was very exhausted from his trip. But my mom said they actually have somewhere to go that night so they might as well bring Yesha and me to the place. So I agreed. At about 6:45 I was all fixed wearing slacks and long sleeved polo folded up. We went to Yesha's new apartment where I saw her and Tita Mamwah waiting for us outside the gate. That was the only time Yesha's and my parents met. Tita Mamwah actually wanted to make beso-beso with my mom but she said she's not mabango daw kaya no na lang (those are her exact words). After some chikahan and kumustahan, we left for Jade Palace.

Zippy, the brother of the debutant and the one who tagged us into attending the party, told us that the event would start at 7:30 pm. Yesha and I were both happy that we were just on time when we arrived. But when we came to the entrance, we saw the ""promo board,"" stating that the function we are going to attend would still be later at 8:30! Grrr! Of course we wanted to turn back since we were an hour early but no can do because my parents have already left and there is no place for us to make tambay near Jade Palace. We had no other choice but be early birds. When we came into the function room, we realized that we were not at all that early since there already were a handful of people. There were men wearing neckties while others weren't and there were ladies too dressed in gowns. They were sitting around one table and on another table is what-seems-like-to-be-a-family. Yesha and I were hesitant into entering since we don't know any of them and our only connection to that party still hasn't arrived. We got stares from the bunch of teeners as if asking who we were but what bothered us really were the stares of the what-seemed-like-to-be-a-family. They look at us as if insinuating we are gatecrashers. But Yesha and I just made deadma and then proceeded to a table at the back. I tried contacting Zippy to ask him where he is and to tell that we already are at place but he's so nagmamaganda that both his contact numbers are unreachable. Hmph! Good thing that a few minutes after we came in, Ken arrived and kept us company. We were now more at ease since politically speaking, we're already a crowd. We kept ourselves busy by sharing stories and making okray whatever we can at the function room.

Before the strike of 8:30, Zippy arrived but he pretended he didn't see us. We continued our chitchat until Zippy gave up his act and pretended again to be surprised to see that we were already sitting around one of the tables. We exchanged banters and okrays. One of them was about him wearing a neck tie and not telling us about it. Not long afterwards, Gil came in. Now the Voltes Team is complete: Gil, Zippy, Ken, Yesha and me. =)

The program started a few minutes past 8:30 with the dance of the 18 roses. Now this is where the ""fun"" (pwede rin horror) begins. The reason why Zippy and some of the other guys were wearing neckties is because it is part of the motif for the 18 roses. The dance commenced and I think Zippy was the 2nd or 3rd to dance with the debutant. When the 18 roses was halfway through, I saw Zippy's mother point at me then walk towards me holding neckties. I already had the feeling something's up but the possibility of what I'm thinking to happen is considerably low. When she was right in front of me, she asked me if I could substitute for one of the 18 ""roses-ers"" because he's coming in late. I opened my mouth wide to answer but I couldn't say a yes nor a no. I was completely speechless. Horror of horrors! I don't know the debutant and neither do I know the steps of the dance (or how to even dance, per se). I really wanted to say no but I was already frozen in my seat. Besides, one of my friends already picked a necktie for me. I could really say they're prepared. Where could you find a debut party where they bring neckties in cases of emergency? Hmmm... that made me think whether it was pre-meditated or not. But I'd rather think of that later and instead think about saving myself from the disgrace that I'd be putting myself in later. I don't know how to knot a neck tie so Ken did it for me. He tried it on himself then removed it so that I'd just fix it on myself. Yesha was the one who put it through my head because my hairdo might get destroyed. My hands were already shaking and wet from being tense of what could happen next. I got up and stood next to the others waiting relaxedly for their turn. While I was standing and waiting for my turn, one of my legs was already shaking. I just moved around to prevent people from noticing it. I studied the steps but I was still intensely nervous. When it my was dreaded turn, I introduced myself to the debutant telling her that I'm just a substitute so she just has to bear with me. I asked her to give me the cue on when to turn, where to step and where to face. In all fairness, I think I delivered well. Except for times where I almost stepped on her gown and times where I kept on looking at my feet 'cause they hardly can move. Hahahahaha! She even commented that I'm really shaking. Even after the dance, I was still under trauma and my legs and hands were still shaking , this time, uncontrollably. Even during the picture-taking. Hahahahaha!!!

That was really an experience I won't forget. The stares, the drama, instant 18 roses-er, instant friend and my 5 minutes of fame (or is that shame?). Oh well... sabi nga ni mommy, that's my only contribution since I don't have any gift for the debutant nga naman. I still consider myself lucky though. What if the it was the 18 gifts instead which lacked participants? Eh di si Yesha ang papalit...ano ngayon ang gift mo eh pareho tayong walang regalo? Hahahahaha!!! Malay mo bigla kang maglove, hugs and prayers dun! =P

P.S.
Grabe ang haba... Ang pangit pa ng pagkakasulat... Nawala bigla ang thrill. Wala man lang sense of climax ang kwento. Hala sige, Phippo! Okrayin mo sarili mo tutal ma-okray ka naman...para fair doon sa mga naookray ko di ba? You wouldn't say I'm unfair. =)

"event","My emotions are still in a hurly burly. Everytime I peek into my present train of thought together with its concurrents, I get so overwhelmed. Sometimes, I do let them out of the tunnel by sharing my thoughts with a friend or a colleague. Other times, they just get derailed; stuck before it ever comes out, never to be found again. Whatever transpired during the past few days has had a greater impact on me than I have expected: scourging bliss, thundering serenity and stuporous enlightenment.

Right now, I'm still approaching the crossroad. If the divergence where the road furcates becomes too overpowering, I guess I'll just turn back... If there is still something to go back to.

I hope a train hits and drags me along to where ever its destination may be. Of course, there would be different ends in waiting for that train. It could stop, welcome me and let me hitch nicely. It could also hit me hard, crush me and overrun my body. It could as well traverse another track not minding me as it goes.  But I fear I might never see another train again. That if I wait too long, even the tracks would have been taken out too. Oh well..

Just pretend you didn't get to read this. Its just my imagination going nowhere... 

Now back to regular programming... (pun not intended) =P"

It funny how a few girls can cause such chaos, neighbors were complaining today =). The funnier part is that it was because of the blasting 90s boyband music. 

Ok I have a crapload of work to do ahhh. 
On a sadder note, four of my birds died

So far it's not that special of a day and starting right now it's going to suck because for the rest of the day all I can do is schoolwork and marching band practice in the FREEZING COLD.

Of course band rehearsal just has to be scheduled the same day so I might not even be able to go to dinner avec ma famille which sucks.

Yeahh I'm supposed to be doing AP American but I really don't feel like it. I've been staring at the same question for 2 hours, no exaggeration. That reminds me, how much does the Military Commissions Act suck?! I didn't have a huge problem with Bush before but now I do. It's so not cool. I would so protest against it if I had the chance.

"event","So I'm watching the movie ""The Shining"", you know the first one with Jack Nicholson in it. Well I realized how random that movie can be. I mean I'm  sure somehow it all connects and adds to the plot of the story but it's still odd. Like this one time when I was watching it before, yes this my second time watching it because I don't have a life, I remember in the end when the mother was running through the hotel frantically searching for the little boy, she looks inside a hotel room and sitting on the bed are two men, one dressed in a rabbit costume, and other other one possibly in a dog costume but I can't remember. Anyway, it was the oddest thing, it didn't have anything to do with the story. Well actually, maybe that scene was in the recent bad-remake of the The Shining and not the one I'm watching right now, yeah that one was pretty bad. 

Okay so diverging from my Shining story. I haven't written in a really long time and I think I'll eventually get rid of this journal. I knew I would. School is a giant hole of never-ending stress and I hate it with a passion. My classes are really annoying and hard. Well no, only AP chem is hard and ruins my whole day. I'm thinking about dropping it. Okay, I can't really drop it because I'd like to.

Canada/Michigan = fun, I went horseback riding, went to Niagara Falls for 4034762036th time, saw The Descent (good movie), and did stuff with family. It was a good trip, I wish we went to Wonderland though, there are roller coasters there. 

Band Camp = definitely not what I expected, met new people, learned how to play the xylophone even though I still suck at it, and it was overall a good experience and I don't regret that I joined Marching Band. I can't wait for the competitions. 

Yeah so that's a really small summary, I'm too tired to go into detail. 

So after being away from home for so long I thought: I can't wait to sleep in my own bed. When I finally get home... not to mention that my mom was throwing a pre-wedding party the same night, all my furniture is gone. Yes, after spending days re-arranging my room to be perfect, I have to re-arrange it again. Re-re-arrange it. It SUCKS. All the furniture it very pretty though, hand carved and stuff but it's all very small. There's no way I'm going to fit all my clothes in there so something will have to change. Still pretty. My room looks more sophisticated... which I don't like. I liked the way it was before.

Well one day I tried to use it but I ended up jamming the machine and it took my mom 20 minutes to fix. Anyway, afterwards my mom taught me how to use it and then I starting sewing anything I could get my hands on. It's addictive.

"event","I took a nap today. I really hate taking naps because they never end up actually being ""naps"". A regular nap in my mind is a few hours, ranging somewhere between 1-3 hours. When I nap it turns into about 6-8 hours and I wake up around the time that I would normally have gone to sleep, around 12-2. Then I stay up all night and fall back to sleep at around 5 or 6 o'clock. And I wake up at like 1 in the afternoon when I normally would have woken up at 10. I lose 3 hours. I feel like morning is the time I get most things done and by taking naps I lose my morning, even though I'm a horrible morning person. Well, so basically by telling you by normal and nap-included sleeping routine... you're probably painfully bored... so then stop reading. And if not, then keep reading =). 

Chhhokay. So I'm leaving for Canada on the 11th which should give me enough time to finish my AP Chemistry summer homework so I won't have to worry about it when I come back. And during the car ride to Canada I can maybe finish the 2nd reading book for school. I hate picking books from those reading lists, I have so many other books I wanted to read this summer but I can't. I'm also a slow book-reader so I can't just rush through them because I like understanding the books. Why spend so much time reading if you don't get the message? 

Besides having to do ""extreme"" (parent-forced) SAT studying, I don't have that many other things to do. Except the rest of August is taken up by Canada and... band camp (keep all comments to yourself =D).

I'm taking care of an orphaned baby rabbit but I feel incredibly guilty because I think I might have played a part in it's orphanage. See while my nanny was watering the plants she discovered a rabbit's nest with six little babies. That night it starting pouring (I mean practically hail) and I felt horrible for the baby rabbits since I read that the mother rabbit only comes to feed them for 5 minutes a day and then the rest of the time their alone. I forced my mom to come outside with me and bring them in and put them in a cardboard box that I layered with towels. We put them back early the next morning before the mother had a chance to see they were gone. I was really just trying to keep them from freezing or drowning to death. Well after that they were fine for a while but eventually flies starting gathering around the nest and when my mom looked, they had all died and had been decaying there for days, except for one, almost starved to death and living in a nest with it's dead brothers and sisters. Geez, it was so heartbreaking. My nanny blamed it on me saying that because I touched them the mother rejected them  but I'm really sure that after we put them back that first time she came back because the nest had been re-made and put back together neatly and their was fur everywhere which is a sign that the mother was there because she sheds her fur and uses it to make the nest more comfortable for the babies (Yeah, I read up on mother rabbit care). So basically, the mother isn't coming back and we obviously couldn't leave that poor lonely rabbit to die so now we're caring for it. I hope it doesn't die, I mean we don't know exactly how to take care of it but hopefully it lives. It's only a few days old and it's eyes haven't even opened yet. 
<br>
I can't help but feel responsible for what happened. My mom said that it was fate and if the rabbits were meant to die then nature would have found a way to kill them anyway. Now the only way I can feel better is if I nurse the surviving baby rabbit back to health and retrieve it to the wilderness. 
<br>
Well, I'll update later on the rabbit since I'm sure this story is so incredibly interesting for you. Yeah well, this is my exciting life. 
Be a good citizen and pray for the baby rabbit."

So let's see. Today's my mom's day off so I spent time with her and we went shopping, yay. And then I got a bitchy call from my supervisor at Queens Hospital (that's where I'm volunteering) and she told me that although I was a good learner I was ""inconsistent"". Well that's because I'm trying to concentrate on my SAT classes too but no, she's too stupid to understand that. Ok seriously, maybe if their lucky they get one volunteer over a short period of time like the summer. It's not like they depend on the volunteer during the rest of the year, all I do is lessen the load but when I'm gone it's back to the normal routine. If I missed a day for two it wouldn't kill them. Who cares, she smells funny anyway.

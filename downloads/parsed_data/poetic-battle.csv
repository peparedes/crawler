The lute, or guitar or harp in my hands -- the instrument I play -- my feet in the sand.
The cool ocean breeze -- pushes the tendrils of my hair away.
I sit, I smile, I sigh of yesterday.
The grass behind me struggles to make it through the sand.
Clawing like the rising of a zombie, at first with its hands.

The area twinkles, like watching the light in your eyes.
They glitter and then are gone.
They are silenced like my song.
They are taken away to death.
To Charon's grasping, endless breath."

"event","Wide awake and it's only 10,
On my LJ, Poetic battles again.
Perhaps this weekend, I will find a duel.
Two blades, two shields and all the old rules.
3 lines , 4 lines, 2 lines or haiku.
Two souls, two pens, and all the old rules.

Dueling in the park at a table near the ducks.
Or dueling through the internet, strangers and such.
Dueling through a text while I'm driving in my car.
Or dueling in Tennessee in the mountains with Aunt Star.

The duels are delicious, I enjoy such a battle.
The duels are nutritious, Sweeping through shadows.
Running with winds and dancing with fires.
We duel with the lute, the word and the lyre.
We speak in the words of the soul of man.
We duel with our minds, not the mettle of our hands.
We spin and we thrust, we dance and we parry.
We chase like the fox, but dash like the rabbit.
With a poetic license we create through your eyes.
The tales of the children, the tales of the wives.
The tales of that the narrator himself, will not speak.
The tales of the strong, the humble, the meek.

But with two blades, two shields, and all the old rules.
We dance the dance of the poetic duels."

Confess the sins of a troubled mothers boy.

She makes your lunch for you Dave.
She folds your underoo's for you Dave.

It's ok if you want to hurt yourself.
I'd send you razor blades so you can parade against your flesh.
But to lie to my friend so you can lie with her.
To deceive an old flame so you can feel her burn.
Your minds illusions are projected out of your mouth.

Her words are not meant to fall upon your deaf ears.
And her heart.
Her heart is not destined to be held by you."

Not a partial birth, and not an abortion.
Not an act of murder or the incentive of sending him back to heaven sooner.
A pain has emerged.
A pain that tears through the flesh and up the spine.
A pain that verges on the life of the mother and borders near the caverns which the baby would never escape from.
How does one make that kind of decision.  To determine the ending of a life or the ending of your life.
Is it based on a selfless timetable of your experiences.
Could you allow the child to reap a life of motherless experiences?
Can you and or the child survive the pain and torment, since it is months before birth is possible.
Can you as the mother endevour through the wicked sickness that grows inside you and means to capture the life of your child, while dragging you down into the oceanic depths of eternal sleep?
Will you be standing 6 months from now?  Or will your child stand alone?
Or will mother and child live under a different Son then we do now?"

We pick apart the worlds that collide and help hide the fragments of you.
But in all the space that is limitless, you are the limit.
The finish line isn't far ahead, but every new line crossed.
Is a new path, a new way, a new vision.
It will bring new plights, new diseases, new sadnesses.
They will tear at your legs like the hands of those who have fallen.
Always looking for a step up.  And the lost want a hand, and then they want a leg, and they'll grasp anything they can to stay above the dirt for a moment.
To bask in your sunshine, to wash in the same springs that run across your body.
To remind themselves that if they wanted anything bad enough.
They would conquer worlds and move mountains.  They would dry rivers with their merit and throw stars from the sky just to make one more wish.
There would be nothing that could stand in their way.
But then reality settles in again and they crawl back into the caves and holes.
They play with their toys and build castles in the mud.
While they could be building castles in the clouds."

Lightly run your fingers like they are two little people skating on ice over their body real gently.
As if the lines in the ice that are being skated on are goosebumps rising from the frozen water.
Let the sounds of her breathing dictate the jumps, the sweeps and possibly even the flips.
A triple axle in the world of touch, is the progression down the spinal column.
As warm digits, touch soft skin.  
Tiny explosions of breath, spill out like a silent hunter from her closed lips.  
Pushing the red gates that surround her castle of communication open.
A stolen glance of her eyes upon your hands, and then back to your eyes -- reveals a smile.
She is wrapped up in the silk of the moment.  
Like the blanket on the cold winter morning, with the realization that you don't have to leave that safe haven of a feeling.
Your hands grip and move pushing the skin and the lay lines of nerves in her body around.
Each movement spreads the energy from her internal lay lines over her body.
With the quickness of a heart pulsing, your hands should never stay in the same place.
Each new section, is like the next step upon a crystalline staircase.
A delicate shift in weight could cause a crash, which would leave her body in an uproar.
But if you dance too lightly upon the stairs -- you shall take her anywhere.
The line lines in the sand of massage are ever shifting like the ticking of the clock on time.
Your hands and fingers are the marching soldiers of warmth and care.
Remember these things when you send them out."

Each spot's, just a flickering dot.
If you reach out.
More than your hands
More than your feet.
More than your time.
More than your deep thoughts.
More than the shallow streams as well.
If you reach out, God is there.
He never left you.
The journey is to not find your answers.
The journey is not to figure out the meanings.
They are all there, right infront of your face.

One simple book.
One dusty cover.
Like your heart. -- Open it wide.
There is no risk in learning the Truth.
There is no fear in knowledge.
To fill up the dark hole, that sits in your soul, with the warmth of Jesus's Love.
Why do we -- as human beings run away from the heat?
We charge aside. Distractions and conditions are our excuses.
Environmental elements, crazy drama -- and the fear of actually knowing.
We fear actually knowing.
We strive to gain knowledge -- and when it is reached we deny it.
For -- what is there to live for, if you have reached it so easily?
LIFE. HAPPINESS.  
The Ability to help out your fellow man stand on his feet.
The remembrance of getting help when you yourself couldn't walk.

The secret of the night is heard by those who listen with their hearts.
The secret of the night, is only a secret for those who fear to learn.

Eric Camil Jr/Poetic-Edge May 1st.

Dangers got headshots, but she really got me in the heart, 
I hold her nade close..as my body comes apart
A beautiful rose, with thorns 5.56cm long, she explodes outward, and I wish to embrace her.
Her knifes edge cuts deep into my soul, and only I can only grimace.

Danger i cannot even begin to count how you raise my choke to ungodly levels.
How my ping bounces faster than my heart.
How I find myself silencing the ignorant, to stop them from wasting the air that you breathe.
Alas..my true love has slain me, I am weak in my body as I die from her bullet wounds to my skull, the blood rushes yet my heart bursts onward.
Forward is the force that allows me to respawn, to seek such grace.

What I wouldn't give for a morning sunset caught in your ever changing eyes, watching the waves cascade shadows across the beach that bow from the enchantment you envoke.
I compare the depths of your eyes when they are aligned in an azure color.
I find not even the deepest cut of diamond to fathom such design and magnificience.

I throw my weapon to the ground, my true love remains silent, she is embaressed by such prose being spun about her glorious being.
I find my heart on the table, and it winces, better to impale it with a rusted piece of metal,
then to let it suffer the cold miserable fate of never knowing at all.
I am taken back, suprised, as if a knife had cut into my back.
I find myself humiliated, washed aside in a quiet room like broken shells picked up carelessly by the tide.

For what is a love that is kept secret, hidden, like a shimmering orchid that braves the heat, to not keep it out in the open sunlight -- would be to banish its chance to grow.
There is no love i presume -- no tower scaled, no rank to be scored, no KDR to raise.
Nothing would fill the engorging leviathan that rages in my heart wishing to be free in her passionate arms.

A beam of light cuts through the mirage of clouds that are pasted across the sky to hide the clear blues that try to escape.
A few birds gleam down the horizon line, blurred by the sun's bright beams and the distance, they soon disapear -- as if existance was a hallucination to the onlooker.
On a single white stone whose inlays show the wear of a thousand years of weather -- sits a beautiful woman.
Her legs lay against the cool ivory white stone, hardly a notice in the stones texture can be felt.
Her hair catches the sun, her smile makes a single mangolia on a distant tree bloom.

She isn't the type of woman who you easily find the words to simply define.
Lady, Girl, Female, Madame, Miss, -- there seems to be not a suitable word.
There isn't a single thing about her you can eye -- she blends together -- as does her personality.
She is the true definition of enchanting.
It isn't charm or beauty or her physical features.
It isn't her smile,her hair, or her voice.
It isn't any of those traits that weave a spell around you.
It isn't even the honesty in her eyes.

It's her personality emerging from the shell she exists in.
The tiny bit of soul one is allowed to release into the world.
That is what your eyes fall upon.
That's what makes you look again.
That's why you smile everytime you see her.
That's why your heart never ""skips a beat"" -- because it doesn't want to lose rythmn.

She certainly doesn't define you.

She is none of those things.

A true love of beauty -- is not held loosely with apathy.
A true love of beauty -- is that which stands next to each other.

Dreams I once lived to keep knots tied, people's faces smiling and the world spinning evenly.

At all the floating leaves that move at the rivers speed.

I have learned how to truly forgive -- how the heart can still except love, but the mind can compromise on no action.
I have realized to be a steward of the goods I possess and the realization of how I have these advantages at life that I must take dear care to use, hone and amplify.
My brain is not a wasteful thing desired to rot in my head.
My heart is not a stone so cold it radiates Winter's icey touch.
My body is not a shell I can allow to gather the feelings of being weary nor the destruction of the poison I ingest.

Do you know of a woman -- who dreams between blinks?
A woman who knows the etiquette of chopsticks, but will go for a fork.
A woman filled with more laughter in her body then doubt.
Is there such a faerie, a pixie, an enchanting Muse who lights more than the fires of the loin -- but that of the soul?
A women who believes when reaching the peaks of love and life, that jumping from the edge is -- the next step forward.
A woman who spells grey with an E, or gray with an A -- because she likes the way it looks.
A woman who you could never refer to as a girl.
A woman who appreciates being a lady, who loves the rush of her feet leaving the ground -- when her breath is taken away.
Does she exist?
What language must one learn to speak to a woman such as this?
What place in the world must a man travel to -- to capture in his eyes that which entails such a beautiful essence?
Where can a heart like that beat -- where it beats on it's own in happiness.
But where the back up drum of a fellow heart -- a companion beat -- would be enjoyed.
Where is the woman whose eyes you get lost in like a book.
Whose personality is a story that makes you weep, smile, glow and gasp all together.
Where her smile -- gurantees a smile back.
Where she is the one swept unto the back of the horse by the knight.
Or where her fellow rides with her, as she wears the armor.
Where time and memories -- and the experiences that go with them -- are desired to be joyous.
Where everyday is a fruitful gain, in your own garden.
Where she is not the Eve, or the Guinnevere, or the Lilith.
But she is herself -- surpassing those myths and stories.
Defining her own glory and beauty, by the look in her eye -- that leads to her soul.
A woman who the light doesn't bend to her will, or the flowers bloom for her -- but a woman who in Compromises eyes -- walks in the light, and knows it's will -- who slides her digits across a flower -- knowing it's soft subtle texture.
Does she exist?
Where must one take in a deep autumn breath to tangle her scent in your nose?
What pile of leaves of color -- during fall does she hide under?
In the cold winter -- what blanket keeps her wrapped like a spiders web -- warm and in comfort?
In spring -- what lake could I catch her skipping stones upon?
In the summer, in what daisy field does she lay under the blue hued sky?
Have I passed her on the street?
Have I seen her in a store?
Has she been down the street?
I do not know.
But when I watch the sun go to sleep.
Or I gaze on my back at the stars.
I know -- she exists.
My heart reminds me of that -- everyday."

Rarely seen, it creeps -- always there but hardly seen.
Till the night set's. 
Sinking it's roots into the heavens.
Then the moon is there.  Upon the sky and our eyes.
Like a bloated star, it is to late to deny it's existance.
Fever's are such things.
They slowly manifest, leaving tid bits and clues to their presence.
Until it sets -- a fever dig's it's roots into your cells.

Perhaps you even wake up, feeling the chill of the night's wind.

Why do people stop dreaming -- I'm not asking you to banish reality or hide what is going on.
I am just asking you -- why have you let your dreams vanish. 
Why do you dream only while you sleep -- when it can hardly be remembered.
When your eyes are closed -- you shut the gates to your soul.
Your soul -- is where dreams go, to manifest themselves.

I want to go to sleep, in the softest bed, like silk that entwines the body.
The feeling when you are cold, and you wrap yourself in a few blankets.
Balling yourself in your own home-made spiderweb.
When you touch those moments of child-hood, why do you feel you must them throw aside.
Do you stop to do more than just look around?

Where are all the men who used to want to be knights?
Rescuing damsels, falling in love with maidens.
When the stick you held in your hand was your formidable sword.
Not a single dragon being able to stand in your path.
Have you truly stopped wanting a lady of beauty in every-passing way?

Where are all the ladies, the fair maidens.  
Those that were tough, but never minded the helpful hand of a gentleman.
Who had the courage of a lion, and the speed of a hawk.
Who could escape from the dragon whenever she wished -- though she waited for a knight.
Have you truly given up waiting for your knight to break through the mists and reach you?

Everyday I dream about waking up next to someone who is as beautiful as the sunrise.
I'll wake up breathless -- where not even the winds fury can fill my lungs.
I'll think of my maiden out there, beyond the towers of our cities.
I'll give in to wanting to be rescued by my knight, his armor gleaming.

The things that you are comprised off -- your ingredients.
That which on your own personal label of life, is listed as what makes you up.
The high sweet percentage of daily allowed sugar.
The caring and kind compassion mixed with red dye 9.
The honesty, and lack of betrayal marked next to the showing of no trans fat.
The low bitter salt content, yet just enough to make a small sliver on ones daily limit.

A kind of new start with motions reflective of what you desire.

Dish soaped hands of someone elses plates that you wish to not serve.

Where you bury your future, your beauty, slaking the appettite you wish to feed.
The grass is greener on the other side - when you start a new and have plants to root in deep, and less secrets and truths to hide.
When trust is a foundation on a house, and it is more like a swamp.

We keep dancing, in this game we play.
I call you dodge, you call I miss.
This is how, the digital world - revolves with us."

5:30 in the morning.
Something on television brought on memories of the past.
Who would have thought love, could make an appearance on the teli at such an early time.
My heart pulses fast for a few.
Thoughts running across my inner-vision.
Feelings of old pain, and old love.
I can't help but smile.
Hoping everything is going more than great for her.
I miss that feeling for a few more moments.

A moment btw:
Is an unset period of time, lasting as long as the thought does.
After a few, I realize, sleep isn't going to be an option.
Doesn't matter if I worked a long night shift.
Doesn't matter if I am covered in half-dried water on my clothes.
Old memories keep, jogging down memory lane.
I cannot really center which drive -- street -- lane -- culdasac they move to.
I gasp again for air.
I cannot help but admit I do miss her.

But -- now I am at least respected.
It's earned.
I have earned it.
I have developed beyond my old limit.
I gasp again, no sleep, no counting sheep.
Nothing.
My heart bounces again, I try to get it out.

There is no metaphysical knife.
Large enough to slice deep enough.
I am jealous of my own memories.
I am jealous of the reminder seconds of feeling that spring to live.

Heart: Dial 1800-- Remember fucker.
Brain: Logic, you don't go back to a burned building and remorse over what was there.
Blue-Fire: Whatev, I need sleep.

I had to write this.
I had to get it out.
I had to shout.
I had to.
I don't even need to explain why.
Those who have felt what I have understand.
AND those who don't one day will.
Either way, you can win now, or win later.
that understanding, of when you lose a brother, a lover , a cuddler, a burst of passion, an amassed amount of intelligence, a director, a spectator, a bottom, a top, a middle man, a rock, a tidal wave, a collision, a powerful wind, a muse, a great divide, an earthquake, a hell fire, a pile of ashes, a diced and sliced apple, an innocenct, a sin, a sweetness, a drip of honey, a loner, a companion, a fellow traveller, a walker, a stalker, a deep down viscious mental cutter, an understander, a bystander, a victim, a sub, a dom, a home, a mom, a writer, a poet, an equal rights to all those who know it, a vision, a dualist of religion, a godless godfilled questioner, a fence sitter, a painter, a tom sawyer in mouth skillz, a social adept, a chamellion, a room worker, a dance twirker, a sexy vixen on the prowl, a mover and a shaker, a groover and a chiller, a smoker, a midnight toker, a fellow fallen angel, a heaven bound -- hell all around amount of destruction, a callouse, a castle, a palace, a sexual phallice, an idol, a selfish blade, a humble shield, a tactical advantage, a tactical nuke, a map layed out, a closed book, a caged storm, a heart torn, a grower, a--forgiven."

Embrace those beasts.
Those primal reasons to want more then just food to feast.
These circumstances and truths are not dire.
You can barely make it in this world, without accepting your own inner fire.
The blue flames, that creep up over me.
Lead with hurricane force winds.
Spreading up across my body.
I cut my destiny into my skin.
The knife's sharp edge leaving lines of life, dripping down.
This pain I hold close, is not for any sin.
But for my destiny, my calling.
Nothing in this world can hold me.
Nothing in this world can make that not occur.
I have things I must accomplish before I go.
Before I leave for the next world.

So I embrace my animal.
I hold her close to my heart.
Close enough to tear through my rib cage.
Close enough to get near where it exceeds hurt.
Because the dangerous beast inside.
Who spins like tornado's through a field.
She is beautiful in her danger.
She is beautiful -- blue fire -- and real."

The moon is out while the stars are what this night is about.
There is barely a gap to be filled, by their winking eyes.
Not a lot of space, for all the twinking in the skies.
Nebula's of clouds rest in space, shades slightly lighter than darkness.
I jealously wish to be one of them.
It isn't about looking down or eternally being around.
It is about being a giding light.
About being part of the picture.
A simple dot, to the naked eye -- millions of miles away.

The freedom of not being cooped up.
Not being truly alone.
Out in the open, I can talk to god.
Out inbetween the wisps of wind, and the light of heaven.
I know he listens."

This beer is to all those, sitting at home.
This beer is to all those, who feel more than just alone.
This beer is raised, and tipped, sipped and chugged.
To those who sit around sad, unplugged.
When your battery goes.
When your mindset goes.
When the world below, and above, is a heaven you can never know.
When you think her lips will never be present.
Companionship with always be absent.
This beer is to all those, feeling such things.
I can't fade in anymore, I am to busy for such acts.
And I cannot end my life, because being that selfish is just not correct.
But I at times like this want to close the inside of my book.
At times like this, I want to disapeer into the mists.
I am too exhausted for much more fighting.
I have been on the battle-field of my life, so much this past half year.
I am not asking for an easier way.
Those who sip on there beers like myself  -- know this.
They know how all of this feels.
They know what it is like, to be too forgivining, to charming, to much of a friend.
But a friend only when those who need a friend, want one.
I am not tired.
I am not out of breath.
I am raising this beer to those who know all of this.
You are out there like me -- and you know.
That knowledge makes me smile.
Companionship -- based on loneliness."

It can be a lonely world at times.
You find your phone, your internet and even your pager, full of numbers.
But when it comes down to who wants to spend time with you.
You find it is not so.

When people need you, need to talk.
When people want something, even if it is a peaecful relaxing walk.
When someone's got a question, an answer, or some poetry they want listened to.
I find then, my fone rings, my internet beeps, my fax goes off.

I remember the times before.
Before I had a telephone.
I remember, that when I was hard to find.
Now that I am easier to reach.
I am reachless.
Now that the world is grey.
I am speechless.
Now that I wake up happy most of the time.
With little depression left in my soul.
No one cares, to even begin to know."

The light on the outside light -- it flickers.
It flickers at the same pace my heart does.
I wonder if it is going to go out.
My heart -- my inner light.

No matter how i walk, not a single drop of slow rain misses me.
no matter the steps i take, puddles form infront of the other foot.
I push aside, drowned hair, from my eyes.

What memory.  What memory serves me now?
The color of all around has gone grey.
What tone, what feelings did I ever possess.
Now I think that, possibly I never had that chance.

I cross by two kids playing ball.
Against the bleakness of my vision, the red of their ball, hits the floor.
I remember the feeling when my torn heart, did the same.
A ball from a child's small hands.
My heart, from yours.

How -- can anyone breathe?

I walk in a damaged state.
I walk in a war torn world, of a battle I lost.
I wish for the feeling of hate.
When I am engourged by Apathy.

How -- can anyone wake up -- when tomorrow is, just the same.

There goes -- all the little things inside.
A million glass shards, a million thoughts.
Millions of seconds of love.
Why -- a brick against such pretty stained glass?
Couldn't a few pieces been removed to get the point across.

Not a pretty enough picture, not a high enough quality of glass, not a beautiful mirage of colors.

The point sinks in...like a brick to glass."

See the power struggle from above.
Look at it, how it rages down below.
Can you feel, the energy begin to swell.
Washing over the hole - where you fell.

When our powers met -- fingertips apart.
When our minds screamed -- pupils wide open.
When we watched our bodies shake -- under the pressure.
I got a glimpse of your ocean inside.

The elements are left for fools to play.
I twist wind, and you soar the ocean.
We can stand here all day, flirting with power, and grinning like wolves.
But I would rather, take this test to where it should go.

If you can stand inside my tornadoes of passion and heart.
If I can swim in your deep intimate ocean, breathless without my wind.
If we can allow those freedoms to exist.
If the shackles from those before can be broken apart.
Then, I'll step forward first.  
Letting my guard down.
The wall I spent so long to meld, torn down, brick by brick.
Blistered bloody fingers, and sweat soaked skin.
Not letting my guard down.
Opening a door -- buried under cement."

Tears down a mans face.
His feet strong, but pillars of grace.
His coat is black, and his shirt is white.
When I ask you to dance, I wish to dance with you allnight.

I don't have to think, or even concentrate on a beat.
The steps are slow, sensual and always perfectly neat.
The rhythm beats, inside my heart, and it trickles out from my smile.
When I ask you to dance, I ask you to -- stay awhile.

The eye to eye contact.
The grins and twists of hips and shins.
The powerful turns, and the slow sway.
When I ask you to dance, I desire to take you away.

The moonlight keeps the shadows close.
Our bodies move, and under the stars we make the most.
Our shadows barely seen, flicker under the sky.
When I ask you to dance, I ask too live - not die.

Full of respect, and intimate.
I prefer to move you slowly, while each harmony makes it's hit.
It isn't about turning you on or even off.
When I ask you to dance, it is about us -- on the dance floor."

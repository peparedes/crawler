Today is the fifteenth of March. Today was a portentous one for Julius Caesar, but I always look forward to it with an anticipation of joy. Today is the birthday of my best friend.

Happy Birthday Julia, the dearest friend anyone could wish for.

I love this photo. Yes, I&#39;ve stolen it, but I hope I can be forgiven today.

There is added joy and anticipation because we will be meeting in Kiev later in the year. Looking forward to that!<br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","<p>I think I&#39;m getting old. In fact I&#39;m sure I&#39;m getting old. Being realistic, I knew it would come, it always does, but I didn&#39;t expect it quite yet, and I certainly hadn&#39;t prepared for some of the things that come with it. The creaks in the morning I can handle, the aches at the end of a tiring day I can put up with. I can even accept walking into a room and wondering what the hell I went in there for.</p><p>The thing that is hardest to come to terms with is the intolerance. I&#39;ve always seen myself as being particularly tolerant - or should that be peculiarly tolerant? - noted for it, in fact. Considerate to a fault, me. I&#39;ve even been used as an example in a magazine article about British consideration and tolerance.</p><p>So, what&#39;s gone wrong? I hear you ask. I wish I knew. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all entirely down to me. But that could just be me being a tad intolerant. I&#39;ll explain.</p><p>Let&#39;s use an example. When I&#39;m at work and lunchtime comes around, I head off to buy something in the town. I probably shouldn&#39;t say where I go, but let&#39;s just say that it rhymes with Barks and Fencer. From the office it&#39;s a fairly short walk through the town centre. On a sunny day it&#39;s a pleasant walk, at any other time it&#39;s just something you have to go through to get to where you want to be.</p><p>The thing I find annoying, the thing that seems to have eroded my tolerance and consideration, and Britishness, is demonstrated by a very small, insignificant few steps on that journey between my office and where my lunch is waiting. It&#39;s the doorway of Barks and Fencer. Yes, just the doorway - I have other gripes about this world-renowned, seller of underpants, knickers and things to cover them up, but they&#39;ll keep for now.</p><p>The shop is in what used to be Taunton&#39;s second-best-known hotel, which closed a long time ago and got repopulated by various things, including a rather fine Waterstone&#39;s book shop and, of course, the pants shop. The doorway is nothing special. Automatic double doors peel themselves back as you approach and, although I&#39;ve never actually stopped and gawped, presumably close behind you. If there&#39;s no one in front of me I&nbsp;quite like doing a Jedi hand sweep as I approach, making it look like I&#39;m opening them with my incredible powers.</p><p>As I say, the doorway is nothing special yet I fear it affects a lot of people in nasty ways. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t believe I exist and won&#39;t open when it sees (or doesn&#39;t see) me coming. It&#39;s a bit embarrassing to slam into the door when you think it should have opened for you, and you believe it&#39;s just playing games and will cave in at the last moment, and doesn&#39;t. But even that isn&#39;t the problem.</p><p>I think we&#39;ve established that this is probably the most special completely unremarkable door in the universe. And it must have unseen powers beyond anyone&#39;s imagination. The nub of the matter is this. When other people walk through the door I can only assume one of two things. Either it drains them of all energy and impetus, or the shop full of underpants and my lunch is so enthralling that people entering are completely bamboozled as to what to do next. This is because every time I follow someone through the door, as soon as they&#39;ve set foot beyond it, they stop, completely and utterly. It&#39;s like they become welded to the ground and just can&#39;t go on. It&#39;s like they weren&#39;t prepared for the wonders they&#39;d find inside. It&#39;s bloody annoying.</p><p>And it doesn&#39;t stop there, even though they do!</p><p>On the way out it&#39;s exactly the same. People walk out through the doors, take just one tiny, infant step onto the pavement and freeze, bewildered, presumably wondering where the hell that sunlight, or Somerset rain, is coming from; wondering why there was a sudden change in temperature. Again, it&#39;s bloody annoying.</p><p>In the grand scheme of things this isn&#39;t remotely important, but it wears my tolerance painfully away to just below the skin where all the nerve endings live. It makes me mutter under my breath, and probably much worse,&nbsp;as I nearly bump into one of these bizarrely transfixed people, or have to avoid them dramatically.</p><p>Is it just me, or does this happen in other places and annoy other people?</p>"

But I also want to be understood. I have to wear two wordy hats &ndash; the one I use when I&rsquo;m writing for myself, trying to be creative and having fun, and then there&rsquo;s the one I have to wear at work where it has to be all straightforward, open and easy to follow. I try to make my creative stuff like that too, but I know I make the rules there; I don&rsquo;t make the rules in my work use of language. But I do have to enforce them, which can be fun sometimes.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">This is a genuine email that I received at work. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Here&rsquo;s the background. There were problems with the computer system &ndash; there often are. Some people couldn&rsquo;t get into their emails, some people couldn&rsquo;t open Word, and then they would be able to but couldn&rsquo;t save anything. The next day it would happen to a different group of people. This went on for a few days.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Then this email came out, sent to everyone in the building. Given the problem, I would question whether an email was the right way of telling people, but&hellip;..</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">&ldquo;In conjunction with Third Party Supplier and Consultancy our ICT Network Services Communications team are continuing to proceed with further analysis, fault finding and eradication of any possible failure that may reside within the configuration or item on the network which is still continuing to cause internal County Hall network interruption problems similar to yesterday. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">&ldquo;I will of course inform you when a resolution has been found. However and regrettably at this present moment I cannot give an exact time of fault resolution.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">&ldquo;Due to the intermittent nature of the fault it is difficult to say categorically, how many customers are affected.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Now that&rsquo;s a really wordy way of telling people what&rsquo;s going on. In fact it makes the message almost unintelligible, and probably doesn&rsquo;t tell them what&rsquo;s going on, at least not in a way they&rsquo;ll easily understand. I&rsquo;m sure the person who wrote felt they had to use language like that because it&rsquo;s what was expected of them. My argument, and the thing I have to enforce, is that it makes more sense to give people a message they&rsquo;ll actually be able to follow. </span></span>

"event","<p>I&#39;ve written about this on a few occasions before, and now that it&#39;s happened I thought I would break my (unintentional) silence to round it all up.</p><p>Yesterday, between seven in the morning and ten at night, the people of Scotland had the chance to vote on the future of their nation. It&#39;s a rare thing in these islands for such an obvious democratic event to happen at all. Yes, we have elections, and those elections are run in such a way that they never represent the actual will of the people. If a political party gets forty per cent of the vote they achieve a landslide victory. But that&#39;s another story.</p><p>Scotland had its moment in the sunshine - a rare thing in Scotland in my experience. I was there once at the beginning of July, contending with temperatures that didn&#39;t get above four degrees, and horizontal rain. If you see photos taken in Scotland, the chances are that someone has photoshopped in the blue sky and the shadows. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Scotland, I love Scottishness and I love that I have Scottish ancestry. Those things are very important to me, and that&#39;s why I took a keen interest in the independence referendum.</p><p>It all started a couple of years ago. There was an election and for the first time the Scottish parliament ended up being run by the Scottish Nationalist Party. One of their manifesto pledges was to have a referendum about independence. That set the ball rolling. It took a while, but a date was fixed, rules were drawn up and a question was drafted - &#39;Should Scotland be an independent country?&#39; - a question requiring a simple &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; answer. Six little words that would have a huge impact on the future of the UK, whatever the final answer.</p><p>Debates were waged, families and workplaces divided, and more Scots registered to vote than ever before. There was, of course, quite a bit of misinformation too - that always happens when politicians are involved. Some wonderful British icons were mauled in the arguments, the currency and who would have a right to use it, the NHS and the way it&#39;s funded, North Sea oil and who should benefit from the wealth it generates, the Queen and who she should reign over. Both sides had very different ideas about those things. Both sides made promises they stood no chance of keeping - again, that&#39;s politicians for you.</p><p>Anyway, the day, yesterday, finally came. The lies, conflation, exaggeration and rhetoric died away as people finally got their chance to put a cross on a slip of paper, stick it into a metal box and walk away in a democratic euphoria.</p><p>The polls closed at ten o&#39;clock last night, and by five this morning the result was known. More people had voted than ever before in any form of Scottish election, and for the first time that included 16 and 17 year olds. Good.</p><p>As I said in my previous entries about this, I was torn for a long time on which way I would vote if I had the chance. Living in the south of England, of course, I didn&#39;t have a vote. Good. My Scottish genes wanted independence, my English ones didn&#39;t. All the others, well established genes from other parts of the British Isles, from Western Europe and beyond, didn&#39;t, I have to confess, get much of a say. It surprised me but my English genes won out. I decided that, personally, I didn&#39;t want Scotland to be independent, I didn&#39;t want the main link in the UK severed. And, I wouldn&#39;t have wanted the rest of us to suffer Conservative governments for ever more - that just isn&#39;t healthy.</p><p>So, listening to the radio this morning, I heaved a sort of sigh of relief when it was announced that the people of Scotland had voted to remain as part of the UK. I had thought it would be a close run thing, but the final margin was 55 per cent &#39;No&#39; (to independence) and 45 per cent &#39;Yes&#39;.&nbsp; </p><p>And happily, our national nature says that &#39;that&#39;s that&#39;. We will continue to talk about it but not to question the decision. It&#39;s been made, now sit down, have a cup of tea, perhaps something stronger, and work out moving forward together. That&#39;s what I like about us. In other parts of the world, people are so frightened by the possible result that they choose not to have the debate, they resort to violence and a lack of consideration that we just can&#39;t contemplate here. How unbritish can you get?</p>"

"event","<p>As you will know if you read my entry last week, on Friday evening I was privileged to attend a preview and official opening of a new exhibition at The Museum of Somerset in Taunton. It was a gorgeous evening and standing in the courtyard of Taunton Castle, glass of lemonade in hand (I was driving as always) mingling with the other invited guests and watching colleagues working themselves into a frenzy, was a great experience.

We were all eager to see the new exhibition, but first had to go through the ritual of welcoming speeches and acknowledgements of all the hard work that had been put in to get us where we were.

Here are a few pictures - not mine because I didn&#39;t feel it was appropriate to take my camera along. I had a quick look around the exhibition and promised myself to go back when there weren&#39;t as&nbsp;many people around and more time to take it all in.

I was really impressed by the artwork in the centre of the room (in this photo, the soldier with his back to you). It was specially commissioned for the exhibition and is created using poppy seeds.

At the end of the exhibition there is a painting of this man, Harry Patch. He died, aged 111,&nbsp;only a few years ago. He was the last man alive who fought in the trenches on the Western Front and was a Somerset man through and through. I think this is an incredible picture showing his warmth and intelligence. He didn&#39;t talk about his part in the war until he was over 100, then he realised that talking about it might actually help to prevent something like that happening again. He was truly remarkable.</p>"

"event","<p>I&#39;m feeling quite proud at the moment. I&#39;ll explain. As I&#39;m sure you all know, this year is the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the first world war. Obviously, along with a lot of other European countries, this is a very significant anniversary for the UK. Over the past few months, and sometimes longer, a lot of projects all over the country have been put in place ready for the anniversary. In that, Somerset is no exception.

More than a year ago I was asked by the Somerset Heritage Service to give them advice about setting up a website, what job it should do and what content they should have. I was happy to do that for lots of reasons. I like working with the Heritage Service and have even done some volunteer work with them in the past. The result was <a href=""http://somersetremembers.wordpress.com/blog/"">http://somersetremembers.wordpress.com/blog/</a> .

Although I am very firmly a pacifist and always have been, I can&#39;t change the past, and we need to know about things like this war so that we don&#39;t make the same stupid mistakes in future (even so, a vain hope I think), so the war interests me too. On top of that, my grandfather actually fought in the war. He was posted in Palestine looking after and driving horses. When I was a child he used to tell me some stories about things that happened to him and people he met. Of course, because I was so young, he didn&#39;t tell me anything grim or horrific - and I&#39;m sure there must have been things like that - but I did get a bit of a feel for his part in it all. Sadly, I don&#39;t remember most of what he said, which is a pity, and he hasn&#39;t been around to ask for a very long time, but I do feel a connection even now.

As part of the project I gave advice about, the Museum of Somerset is putting on an exhibition called Somerset Remembers the First World War. The exhibition opens this coming Saturday, and I hope it will be a great success. A couple of weeks ago I received an invitation to a posh opening evening this Friday. The exhibition will be opened by the Lord Lieutenant of Somerset, Lady Gass (no laughing at the back, please), and is quite a prestigeous event. I feel very honoured to have been invited. I&#39;m also looking forward to actually seeing the exhibition.</p><p>Perhaps my fascination is because it was such a pointless, tragic conflict - really just a stupid family feud that got way out of hand and resulted in the deaths of millions of people and changed the world forever. I&#39;ve recently read a lot about Russia&#39;s involvement - something that seems to be largely overlooked in western European history - an immense event in Russian history that partly led to the downfall of the monarchy and nobility, and the rise of the revolution.

Perhaps it&#39;s also because of my grandfather. We have lots of photographs of family members in their uniforms - my grandfather, his brothers, my great-grandmother&#39;s brothers and sisters - I intend to offer them to the project (to be recorded digitally) so that the sacrifice those people made doesn&#39;t fade away when there is no longer anyone around who remembers them.

Whatever the reason, I&#39;m delighted to have been invited and look forward to attending, and reporting back.</p>"

"event","<p>Here&#39;s a bit of a story, an anecdote. It&#39;s about me and just one of the funny things that seems to come along and stick.

When I bought my car, some time ago, I asked the company I bought it from if they would kindly organise the insurance for me too. There was a reason for doing this. For many years before that I had had company vehicles, so had no recent insurance history of my own. On top of that, the company I had worked for had gone spectaculary &#39;tits up&#39; and there was no one to vouch for me. Becky, at the Toyota dealership, was happy to apply on my behalf and that application netted me a significant &#39;No claims bonus&#39;. I was happy, they were happy and, I suspect, Toyota&#39;s insurers were happy too.

And life went on as normal. Because I pay by direct debit, I just get confirmation that everything is carrying on as before and I don&#39;t need to do anything at all about renewing it. I like that. They send me a pile of documents I don&#39;t even look at - who would? they really aren&#39;t remotely interesting. And, most importantly to me, I keep being insured.

That all happened this time around a few days ago. I don&#39;t quite know why, because as I&#39;ve just said, these documents aren&#39;t interesting, but I had a quick flick through them as I was putting them back in the envelope. Amongst them was a printed copy of the original application, as filled in by Becky at the dealership. There was my name, address, date of birth and a whole load of other facts. I have to confess that Becky had guessed a couple of things, but that was probably done to put me in the best possible light as a low risk driver.

As I was reading down through the form, I noticed what it said next to the innocuous box labelled &#39;Occupation&#39;. I had a chuckle. I looked again to make sure I had read it correctly. I had. I chuckled again. Then I thought, and chuckled again. When I had finished chuckling, and thinking, I decided that I probably had the best job in the world. (Not the real world, you understand, just the insurance world.) The form said that my occupation was, &#39;Inventor&#39;. I hope you&#39;re chuckling too.

That was a few days ago, and ever since, in my idle moments, I have been wondering what exactly I invent - or what I would invent if I really was an inventor. I consider myself to be quite a creative person, but invention is creativity with knobs on - metaphorically and, often, literally.

As I say, I&#39;ve thought long and hard about this and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that I would like to invent things that have already been invented. My creativity would be to invent them in a way that meant that they actually last, that they don&#39;t fall apart, break or self-destruct. I would, in short, build out obsolescence. I do understand that the long-term effect of that would be to not make any money, but I&#39;d be happy, and so would everyone else.

I&#39;m sure everyone else has a burning idea at the back of their minds, the idea of an invention that would change the world. Fellow inventors, what&#39;s yours?</p>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I&rsquo;ve just been looking back through some of my entries and I&rsquo;ve re-read what I wrote here on 19 September last year. It was my column about the impending Scottish referendum on independence. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I saw this video, used as a television advert, yesterday evening (</span></span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvymXo3xF3E""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvymXo3xF3E</span></span></a><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">) and it reminded me that I had planned to revisit this topic. &nbsp; </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Basically, I read that I couldn&rsquo;t decide. In general that doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, as someone who completely fails to commit to anything at all. It&rsquo;s far less complicated that way. But, on this particular issue I can understand especially why I was so spectacularly undecided. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">As I said at the time, there is a part of me (an ancestry I&rsquo;m immensely proud of) that wants Scotland as an independent nation &ndash; after all, it has a culture of its own, an astonishing uniqueness that is easily recognised around the world. Its music, and the wonderful way it sounds, is familiar to most, its literature demonstrates a sense of nationhood that writing from England could never hope to achieve, its art and design is as Scottish as the hills, lochs, islands and mountains that inspired much of it. I intend every pun I use, and this is no exception; it has a voice that is easier to identify than most world accents in any language. Scotland deserves to be seen as being for and of itself. It shouldn&rsquo;t just be a ragged northern part of something else. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Scotland has a lot going for it, there&rsquo;s no denying. To start with, it delights me so very much that Scotland would be the only &lsquo;western&rsquo; country where that vile dark brown muck that might just rhyme with Poky Pola isn&rsquo;t the most popular soft drink. Let&rsquo;s hear it for the very Scottish Irn-Bru (iron brew).</span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">You can feel a &lsquo;but&rsquo; coming, can&rsquo;t you? Of course there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;but&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s always a &lsquo;but&rsquo;. And here it comes&hellip;..now.</span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">But. The loss of Scotland from the United Kingdom would diminish the country, and the nation, beyond recognition. A UK without Scotland would be a mere shadow of what it is now. I can&rsquo;t really imagine, and I think I&rsquo;ve got quite a good imagination, my country not having the Scottish bit. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Obviously, Scotland wouldn&rsquo;t move geographically, it wouldn&rsquo;t up and resettle somewhere warmer. It wouldn&rsquo;t even go for a change of diet, with less fried and more fresh &ndash; cold chips are comically known as a Scottish salad among British stand-ups. But its relationship with everyone else would change. And that&rsquo;s quite a big problem. If the people of Scotland vote for independence, they have already been told that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep the pound. They&rsquo;ve been told they wouldn&rsquo;t automatically keep EU membership (so adopting the Euro would be out too); they wouldn&rsquo;t automatically cling on to the same Head of State (technically, the Last King of Scotland might just be a queen!) and things like banking arrangements wouldn&rsquo;t carry on as before. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">These announcements, teased out of Westminster and Brussels in recent months, must have come as a bit of a setback to the &lsquo;yes&rsquo; campaign. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">No one is ahead in the race, if race it is. The average of the polls I&rsquo;ve seen (and I really wouldn&rsquo;t set any store by opinion polls before the event, because I think I&rsquo;d enjoy misleading them if I had the chance, for comedy and practical joke value, if nothing else) suggest that about 40% support the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; vote, about 40% support the &lsquo;No&rsquo; vote, and the rest are either undecided or not planning to vote. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">There&rsquo;s still a while to go yet. The vote takes place on 18 September, and only voters registered in Scotland get a say. So, my opinion simply doesn&rsquo;t count and certainly doesn&rsquo;t matter, but I still believe I have a right to voice it. Whatever decision the people of Scotland make will have an impact on me, and everyone else in the UK, and Europe for that matter, and on anyone who trades with any of us. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I&rsquo;ve thought long and hard, weighed up the arguments that have swirled around, however briefly, in my head. And I&rsquo;ve decided how I would vote if I could. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The ballot paper will have this question on it: &lsquo;Should Scotland be an independent country?&rsquo; And I would tick the box marked &lsquo;No&rsquo;. There, I&rsquo;ve done it, I&rsquo;ve nailed my colours to the mast. I don&rsquo;t want a UK without Scotland, I don&rsquo;t want to lose the links that all of us being part of one UK bring. </span></span>
 
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I don&rsquo;t want a British parliament perpetually run by the conservatives. (Here&rsquo;s a pleasing fact: there are more giant pandas in Scotland than there are conservative MPs.) We need that balance, we need the cynicism and rebellion that Scotland supplies, and we need the inventiveness, humour and good sense that come along with them. </span></span>"

"event","<p>Since just after Christmas, this is what my outside world has mainly consisted of. The floods are back, some villages are cut off completely, some roads - big and small - are inaccessible and the whole region is under emergency measures (whatever that means.) For a while we were a news story; for a while we had national sympathy and international attention. Then a new story comes along, the reporters take off their wellies, get back into their cars and head off to somewhere more glamorous, even though nothing has changed.

And every day that it rains, however little, delays any improvement by at least a day. This won&#39;t change for quite a long time. Until we get three dry weeks the waters won&#39;t recede. And as it is, the weather here sort of reminds me of a holiday in Scotland in July I once had, when it was almost constantly 4 degrees with horizontal rain.

I&#39;ve lived here most of my life. In fact, my ancestors have been here for hundreds of years, and almost certainly much longer than that. I know this area and I&#39;m familiar with the way it works. The floods are no surprise to me. Some areas of the levels would flood every few years when I was a child. Some areas were deliberately flooded in a controlled way to spare others. But these days the floods seem to happen more and more, covering more areas every year, and more times each year, than ever before.

There are lots of reasons for this, I suppose; high tides, strong winds, but the main one seems to be that the Environment Agency, in a bid to save money, has stopped dredging and maintaining the rivers that drain this reclaimed wilderness. If it hadn&#39;t been drained in the Middle Ages, this area would still be the swamp that Alfred the Great famously fled to as a hiding place in the late ninth century. It seems to be heading back to that. If the rivers aren&#39;t managed, rainfall can&#39;t get away, and this is the result.

They&#39;re pumping but, even though it&#39;s the equivalent of a couple of Olympic sized swimming pools every minute, it&#39;s just a drop in the ocean - excuse the pun - and it doesn&#39;t actually go anywhere. The river is still tidal at this point, so when the tide turns it all comes back again.

This is the road I normally take to get me to and from work every day. It means a detour that adds more than half an hour to my journey each way. Actually, that means that I&#39;m lucky compared to some people who just can&#39;t go anywhere or who live in houses that are flooded and overrun. I should be grateful, but it&#39;s still depressing.

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Is it me, or do we live in a very strange world? Now, I realise that could be a leading question, so I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;m talking about and tell you what I think. (Oh my gods, he&#39;s voicing opinions again!) </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I read an article on The Press website this morning. The Press is where I get my Christchurch news from, where I go to see what&#39;s happening in my favourite New Zealand city (and the wider country) from my own perspective of half a world away.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The article I read was headlined, <b>&#39;Statistics reveal most dangerous foods&#39;</b>. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">That headline made me think, or at least set me thinking about what those foods might be. I couldn&#39;t think of anything. Surely, having used the word &#39;foods&#39;, if they were going to stick to their brief, then the only foods that would be dangerous would reasonably be things that some people might be allergic to; and then I would question whether it was the food that was dangerous over the unfortunate situation the person finds themselves in. My thinking was basically, if it&rsquo;s not food, it&rsquo;s not dangerous food; if it is food, the very word implies that it&rsquo;s sustenance. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">So, slightly fascinated, hoping to learn something amazing, I read the article &ndash; and through the miracle of modern interwebby stuff, <b><a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/eat-and-drink/9253346/Statistics-reveal-most-dangerous-foods"" target=""_blank"">you can too if you so wish</a>.</b></span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I started gulping for air after the first couple of sentences. After a couple more I was questioning my own sanity, that of the journalist who was trying to make a racy story out of nothing, and finally, that of the insured population of a country I love. The long and the short of it is that the story had the wrong headline, or the headline had the wrong story. I never can quite work out which way round that should be. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">How can some idiot halving and removing the stone from an avocado, not thinking about what they are doing and ending up cutting their hand instead, imagine for a minute that it&#39;s the avocado that&#39;s dangerous and to blame? People like that shouldn&#39;t be allowed near sharp objects, let alone an insurance policy. How can someone choking on a piece of meat (and remember I&#39;m a vegetarian, yet I&#39;m still on the side of the meat here) blame that meat for the fact that they don&#39;t chew their food properly? Those people should be condemned to eating pre-mashed and mechanically recovered bits of dead animals, with their hands, in those squalid, loathsome MacBurger-type places. Though in those circumstances, they should probably be warned about accidentally chewing off their own fingers.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">In fairness, the article does mention allergies and various conditions that mean people have to be careful about what they eat, but surely they know that already, so shouldn&#39;t have too many problems unless they are completely off their face.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">As far as I can see, we live in a peculiar world where someone who burns their arm by spilling hot noodles on it, blames the noodles (for being hot, noodly&nbsp;and spilt!). But of course, this does seem to have become a world where blame is the universal currency, and along with it ridiculous corporate arse-covering on a humungous scale. The culture is that there has to be a culprit (who isn&#39;t the idiot damaging themselves, of course) and there has to be a demand for some form of reparation. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I want to make a pact with the world. It&#39;s quite a simple little agreement that I would be delighted to undertake. If people will stop putting patronising little signs on disposable coffee cups that say things like, &#39;Warning: may contain hot liquid&#39;, or, as I once saw on a bottle of shampoo, &#39;For external use only&#39;, then I will happily give away my right to complain, sue or blame someone else. If I&#39;m stupid enough to&nbsp;thoughtlessly try to wash my hair and scald myself with hot coffee, it&#39;s my own&nbsp;bloody fault. If I drink shampoo thinking it&rsquo;s thick, cold, foul-tasting&nbsp;coffee in a very strange shaped container, and it disagrees with me in some way, it&#39;s down to my own stupidity for drinking shampoo in the first place. No one else is to blame.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Then, once that agreement has been made, the rest of the world can stop worrying about me and my wellbeing. I&#39;m sure it will be relieved and can spend its time thinking about far more important things. I will certainly be delighted to take responsibility for my own actions and stupidity. The only thing I ask in return is for the world to stop warning me about things that are completely bleeding obvious.&nbsp; </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Then, if I&#39;m cutting up a pumpkin, and the unnecessarily large knife I&#39;m using slips and .... in every sense of the phrase, I&#39;ll say no more.&nbsp; </span></span>"

Things like this are obviously incredibly subjective, and, as the saying goes, someone&rsquo;s anarchist is someone else&rsquo;s freedom fighter, someone&rsquo;s sinner is someone else&rsquo;s saint. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">I think there are a couple of serious mistakes in the top ten, and would gladly elevate a couple of people to take their places. I also have to remember that the list was of the greatest Britons ever! That&rsquo;s a lot of people to choose from, from a lot of centuries. <span id=""cke_bm_43E"" style=""display: none;""> </span></span></span><span style=""display: none;""> </span>

<span style=""display: none;""> </span><span id=""cke_bm_42E"" style=""display: none;""> </span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">To start with, the poll was carried out just a few short years after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The majority of the nation was still feeling the pain of that at the time, whipped up by large sections of the media who couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about it. I don&rsquo;t think she would make the high end of the list now. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">And I&rsquo;m sort of surprised, even though I&rsquo;m not a royalist, that Queen Elizabeth the second doesn&rsquo;t make the top ten. She actually rolled in at number 24. I definitely think she should be higher than that, if only because she sent my parents a card for their recent landmark wedding anniversary. Though, I would have to question her Britishness. She has much more in common with tenuous German nobility, in terms of her ancestry, than she does with me. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">I would definitely push Alfred the Great up the list quite a way from number 14, probably swapping him with Nelson. Without this king&rsquo;s wisdom, doggedness and foresight, without his passion for learning and his Anglo-Saxon people, England as a nation, would never have existed. I have to express a bit of an interest, because his idea of a united England and his desire to make it happen, formed while he was in hiding from the Danish invaders in the Somerset Marshes within walking distance of where I live. To think that I live within sight, from my upstairs windows, of the birthplace of this country, and I drive past a monument that marks that achievement every day. So yes, he&rsquo;s got to be up there. It&rsquo;s no accident in my mind that he&rsquo;s the only monarch we have had who carries the words &lsquo;the Great&rsquo; after his name. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">The other huge omission is Florence Nightingale. Yes, she was weird; yes, she had her failings; yes, she conducted much of her life from her bed, but she got a lot done for both science and medicine, inventing the pie chart and nursing as we know it. Surprisingly, she was only number 52 on the final list.

A</span></span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: arial;"">part from that, to my mind&nbsp;it&rsquo;s not a bad list. Of course, I would put them in a slightly different order, but so would just about everyone else, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same order as mine. Personally, I would have Darwin streets ahead at the top. I would have Cromwell higher and Elizabeth 1 lower.</span></span>

"event","<p>What&#39;s in a name? Well quite a lot actually. Unable to sleep a couple of nights ago, I was listening to the radio. I like night-time radio, it&#39;s broadcast in a way that suggests the people doing the broadcasting don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s listening. It&#39;s sort of sloppy, yet engaging, amateur and professional all at the same time. Yet, the very fact that they&#39;re doing it at all suggests they believe there is an audience. And, of course, the fact that I&#39;m listening tells me that there must be others out there as well. Interesting.

Anyway, there was a news story about a village in Wales. The village, according to the sign you see as you enter it on the road, is called Varteg. I&#39;m sorry but this little bit might end up being a bit linguistically technical. Please bear with me, it will pass. In Welsh, the letter &#39;V&#39; doesn&#39;t exist, and this means that the village name is an Anglicised version of, wait for it, Farteg. Now, the people of the village, their fellow countrymen and many others want the village to bear its Welsh name spelt the Welsh way. I&#39;m inclined to wholeheartedly support that view. But there is some uproar from the prudish English living locally because they don&#39;t want to see the word &#39;fart&#39; written loud and proud every time they drive through. Personally, I love the idea, and I hope to go there one day to see it for myself. I will chuckle, all the more in knowing that those prudish people probably aren&#39;t offended in the same way by the name Scunthorpe.

I love place names, and I especially love it when they&#39;re funny. I&#39;m sure everywhere has funny place names, whether it&#39;s in the local language, in translation or an accidental rude word in a different language. There&#39;s a small Austrian town that has great difficulty keeping its signs because of its name. I&#39;m sure you know the one I mean - it begins with &#39;F&#39; and ends with &#39;ing&#39;, and it&#39;s not &#39;Farting&#39;. And there are oodles of others all over the place. There has recently been a bit of a battle between the people who think they run Facebook and the people of an Irish town called Effing. The Effing people have triumphed, I&#39;m glad to say.

I know there&#39;s a place in Kent called Thong - which, of course, means different things to different people. In Essex there&#39;s a village called Ugley. I love the thought that there might just be an Ugley Women&#39;s Institute. And again in Kent there&#39;s a Rough Common; the WI there would be interesting too. There are places called Twatt on both Orkney and Shetland. There&#39;s a holiday centre at a place in the New Forest in Hampshire called Sandy Balls. Dorset has a Shitterton and a River Piddle, which has spawned lots of Piddle place names too. I&#39;ve been to Skinners Bottom in Cornwall, where, incidentally, the highest hill is called Brown Willy. Also in Cornwall, I once had a friend who lived at Jolly&#39;s Bottom. I&#39;ve also been to Crapstone in Devon, where, presumably, the quarrying isn&#39;t that great. And I&#39;ve been to Pant in Shropshire.

In deepest, darkest Lancashire there is Ramsbottom, and probably in even deeper, darker Lancashire nearby is Upper Ramsbottom! Talking of which, what happened in Assloss in Ayrshire? Or in Slackbottom in Yorkshire?

In Somerset we have some good ones too, not always rude (more&#39;s the pity) but certainly strange. Near Bristol Airport there is a village called Nempnett Thrubwell, and onother called Clapton in Gordano. Not far from where I live is Curry Rivel - ahh, the Indian food wars! And Four Forks (near Bridgwater) would come in very handy, all things considered.

One of my favourites is the village of Haselbury Plucknett, which is near Yeovil, as are Queen Camel and Camel Hill, though there aren&#39;t any camels there.

All of which leads me to ask you a very simple question. Have you got any near you, and what are your favourites from other places? Actually that&#39;s two questions.....</p>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I don&#39;t know what to think. And that&#39;s not a nice place to be for someone who&#39;s always got bloody opinions, like me. How can I be grumpy if I don&#39;t know what to be grumpy about? How can I be enthusiastic? Ahem, no, that doesn&#39;t happen often these days. Let&#39;s stick to grumpy. This matters to me. I don&#39;t have a particularly well-developed vested interest, but I do have links through ancestry, culture and affection; and a kilt.&nbsp; </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">In almost exactly a year&#39;s time, everyone aged sixteen and over who lives in Scotland will get the chance to vote in a referendum to decide whether they should go it alone, and be independent of the rest of the United Kingdom, ending over three-hundred years of formal union. I don&#39;t live in Scotland, so I have no say or influence. But whatever decision is arrived at affects me and everyone living in the UK, on lots of levels. Just the simple question of what this country will be called if Scotland gets a divorce is a very serious one, though I won&rsquo;t trouble you with it now. And there are loads more things to think about over and above that one. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">There is a huge part of me that is a real fan of the idea. Yes, go Scotland! Shake off the yoke of the English oppressor, stand up as yourself and show the world just how great you are. Scots have invented many of the world&#39;s most important things, Scots have created some of our most beguiling and skilful literature, art and music, Scots have adventured and discovered (in the age of adventure and discovery) punching well above their weight, Scots have shown their criminal dark side with at least equal merit to their southern cousins, Scots are to be reckoned with. After all, is it not a Scot (who we in England choose to suddenly call British because it&rsquo;s convenient to do so) who&rsquo;s Wimbledon champion right now?</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I like to think of an independent Scotland getting rightful credit from its place in the world, getting the benefit of its own resources and skills, and collectively making the right decisions for its own future. Scotland should fly its own flag; something to stand under, proudly eating deep-fried pizza, neaps and tatties, drinking Irn-Bru, Grouse and Tennants Extra, singing &#39;Flower of Scotland&#39; to the famously screechy pipe-driven backing track. Who cares if they have one of the lowest life expectancies in Europe, it would still be a good one and that&rsquo;s nothing to be sniffed at. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">So, yes, I&#39;m a fan. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">But wait, there are other, contrary implications too. We, as a nation, would be the poorer for not having our wonderful neighbours sleeping snuggly in bed with us. How would it be for us to wake up (to doggedly continue with the metaphor) and find that side of the bed cold and unslept-in? They may not like us that much (and let&#39;s face it, who can blame them?) but we, down south, need them whatever we may say. In fact, we need each other and we know it, even if we&rsquo;d never quite admit it.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">If we were to lose Scotland&#39;s representation at Westminster we would be condemned to perpetual government by the toffs and Slytherin wankers of the Conservative party. Without Scotland in the UK we would just have a red and white flag (nothing wrong with that I know, I mean, one of my favourite countries, and the home countries of some of my favourite people put up with that very well), and while blue is a long way from being a favourite colour of mine, it works in our weird Union Jack. If Scotland were no longer in the UK, we would be devastatingly the poorer culturally, we would lose most of whatever gravitas we actually have in the world, our institutions would have to change for the worse because of a sudden imbalance in how we&#39;re put together and what makes us tick.&nbsp; </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">But we could give that twat Rod Stewart back, so it&#39;s not all bad! </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">If the big vote was tomorrow, as I understand it, the result would be more or less divided equally three ways (not easy in a simple &#39;yes - no&#39; ballot!) with about a third of Scots still undecided. That means it&#39;s still all to play for whichever camp you choose to fall into. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">As I said, I don&#39;t know what I want most or least. There are valid and sensible arguments on both sides. You can change people&#39;s minds with good reasoning, even if you &#39;cannae change the laws of physics!&#39; </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I think, as this coming year rolls on, it could all become quite messy. Beam me up until it&#39;s all over.</span></span>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">A news story broke here at the weekend. It wasn&#39;t a surprising one, no &#39;shock horror&#39; this time. The deputy prime minister of this soon to be dis-united kingdom decided to kick off his party&#39;s annual conference with a bit of a bang. It sort of illustrates how insignificant the job is when his big announcement is that in about a year and a half&#39;s time there will be a 5p charge for carrier bags. Read all about it, and I hope you&#39;re sitting down and have the reviving brandy within reach.</span></span>

<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24094290""><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24094290</span></span></a>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Recovered? Good.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I&#39;m sure you&#39;d expect this anyway, but I have a couple of opinions - though more accurately, an opinion and a couple of points to make.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">My first thought, when I turned on the radio and heard the story on Saturday morning was, &#39;Good. About time.&#39; And that was pretty much my second thought too. I don&#39;t see a problem with it; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something up for debate. Just go ahead and make it happen, Mr Clegg. And then I had third thoughts.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">My third thoughts seem to be much more considered than my first or seconds. I suppose it&#39;s because they come ambling along after the initial reaction has looked around and made a run for it. Let&#39;s forget the obvious environmental concerns; they&#39;re a given that I don&#39;t think even have an argument against them. Let&#39;s concentrate on more people-sized issues. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">When I do my weekly shopping I always take a few strong reusable bags of my own, so that I don&#39;t need to rely on Mr Sainsbury&#39;s free handouts. And most people I see doing their shopping at the same time seem to do the same. I think this has become the norm. I have no doubt that people who just drop in for a couple of things don&#39;t bring their own bags. They are more likely to walk out with one of those flimsy things that will eventually cost them 5p, and I&#39;m sure that accounts for a hell of a lot of bags over a day, week, month or year.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">My points, questions and concerns aren&#39;t really about the use of bags, but are more about implementing this scheme. As the BBC article says, this same kind of scheme has been running in Wales for five years. It has gone successfully and raised a lot of money for charity. To me, this creates a bit of a moral dilemma - do you continue to use the supermarket&#39;s bags and see the 5p as a legitimate donation to charity, or do you aspire to being miserly and deny that charitable donation by taking your own bag? Which is better? </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">My next point is more of a rebellious one. If I have to buy a bag, to pay 5p for it, I refuse to pay to then advertise for someone; because of course, the bag is an advertisement. Why, otherwise, do shops and supermarkets make sure their name and slogan are plastered all over the bags they give out? You, carrying their bag through the streets, are advertising for them, carrying a mobile hoarding. And with this scheme you&#39;ll be paying for the privilege. So, I&#39;ve decided that, if that happens and I have to use one of their bags and pay 5p for it, I&#39;ll make sure I turn it inside out before I fill it. Perverse I know, but there you go. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">My nearly final thought (probably my fifth or sixth by now) was even more simplistic. When I was a child, and I went shopping with my mother, in the days before carrier bags had even come along, she had a shopping bag or basket she always took with her. Why can&#39;t we go back to that? Then there just won&#39;t be bags available. People have become lazy, assuming they&#39;ll get a bag when they shop. If that option&#39;s not there they&#39;ll have to do the right thing, and the only people to suffer will be the charities that won&#39;t get their enforced donation. Back to the moral dilemma.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">And finally, why wait a bloody year and a half before implementing such a scheme? When they announce yet another rise in the tax on petrol they&#39;ve hardly finished speaking before the numbers have gone up at petrol stations all over the country. When they put another penny on a pint of beer, you&#39;re paying more that very evening. They have evidence from Wales, and other countries, that this works, they know what&#39;s got to be done, so why not just do it and say that, as of next Monday this is the way it&#39;s going to be? </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Then it&#39;s in the bag!</span></span></p>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Unlike LP Hartley and the entire premise for his novel, &#39;The Go-Between&#39;, I&#39;m not normally given to nostalgia. While I have memories, pleasant or otherwise, from times gone by, I can&#39;t say that I see the past in anything other than a pragmatic way. The definition of nostalgia is: a sentimental longing or wistful affection for a period in the past. I haven&#39;t got that. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">And yet, (you just knew there would be a &#39;but&#39; or an &#39;and yet&#39; or a &#39;surprisingly&#39; coming along with indecent haste) lately my looking back has been decorated with a blob of fondness on top, like strawberry jam on a West Country Cream Tea. The thing with me though, is that it sometimes seems to embarrassingly slide off onto the plate, or much more likely, my lap.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">As ever, and without any more ceremony than I feel I can expect to get away with, I&#39;ll begin at the beginning. A while ago I put together a pile of compilation CDs for a friend. When I create a compilation CD I like to give it a theme, some thought; make sure that everything fits together well, that it starts in the right way and ends perfectly. I like to think I&#39;m quite good at it, and the trouble I take to find the right pieces of music, fit them together in the right way and the right order, tell a kind of story over 80 minutes, is well worth it to the person I give them to. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">One of the CDs I did in this recent pile was based loosely around the thought that, not all music from Ireland is Irish music (by which I mean that it doesn&#39;t have to be diddly diddly stuff to be Irish). The likes of Thin Lizzy, Stiff Little Fingers, Ash and David Holmes have their place and are just as much Irish music as The Dubliners.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Having said all that, I did include a couple of tracks by Clannad (as a bit of a cross-over, a kind of traditional electronica.) In the notes I sent with the CD I mentioned that both these pieces had been used, and were expressly written, as themes for a couple of television series. In telling me what she thought of the CD, my friend said that she was surprised that such good music would be used as television themes, and that it wouldn&#39;t have been likely to happen in her country. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">This set me thinking, would I have enough pieces of appropriate music to put together a television themes CD? If so, what would I use? It turns out that the answer to the first question is, &#39;Oh yes!&#39;. But the second is a bit more complicated. I pulled out a pile of CDs from my, it has to be said, extensive collection. (And yes children, I have and prefer tangible music. None of your paper-thin downloaded stuff for me.) I started flipping through them, finding odd tracks that I might use, not necessarily from television programmes I like or liked, but very much music I like.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Inevitably, hearing one or two of the bits of theme music for the first time for a long time, especially ones used in programmes from my childhood in the dim and distant past, produced the odd wave of nostalgia. One in particular floored me for a while. I didn&#39;t even realise I had it, and I played it three or four times. It really did send my mind racing back to when I was a child. I remember vividly being enthralled by this particular television series, it made a great impression on me. I loved the way it made me feel as a child, and last week I loved the way it made me think about my memories of it. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">&#39;The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&#39;, a quintessentially English story, was actually a French television series. Here it was dubbed into English and narrated by a soft, sympathetic voice. It was in black and white and had a graininess that I loved even then. But it was the theme music that I loved most about the series. I understand now that the music for the UK version was different to that used in other parts of Europe, and I don&#39;t know what other countries got, but ours was a beautiful lilting melody, evocative of the sea and paradise, of loneliness and contentment. I remember wanting to have similar experiences, probably so that I could have that music wafting through my head as I made a shelter on a deserted island, foraged for fruit and milked goats. I can honestly say that this piece of music had more of an impact on me emotionally during my childhood than just about any other (and let&#39;s face it, I have lived through quite an era for popular music.)</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">So, I&#39;m looking forward to putting the CD together, including themes from series like Red Dwarf, Black Beauty, Ski Sunday, Big Brother and much more besides. The new Doctor Who theme will loom large, menacing and uplifting, and Robinson Crusoe will be there evoking a foreign country where they do things differently, a Go-Between linking the past and the present to an uncertain future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>"

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">False notoriety&#39;s just a game.</span></span>
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The tea they drink,</span></span>
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The gin they sip,</span></span>
<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The game they play is leadership.&nbsp; </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Of course, now that I come to quote it, I can&#39;t remember it beyond that rousing opening. But it could well be that there never was any more than that. If I&#39;d written that now, I&#39;d probably have to lie down for a week to get over the exertion and clever wordplay. I must have been very clever back then; what happened? </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The reason I&#39;m saying all this is because of recent world events and my country&#39;s response to them. We&#39;ve finally looked around and seen sense, good sense. Usually, in situations like this, we tag along on the coat-tails of that big, seemingly powerful land way across the western sea. We don&#39;t look at our neighbours and companions, instead choosing to eye up the, if you&rsquo;ll allow me to use the euphemism, school bully and fall into line behind them. I&#39;ve never understood why that is, or even what&#39;s in it for us. After all, a bully is always a bully, even if he&#39;s on your side. Sooner or later the mask will drop, truth will out and you&#39;ll get a kicking too. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The other thing I&#39;ve never understood is why we spend billions on buying weapons from the bully, only to set off those weapons on the bully&#39;s behalf. Then we go back and feel we have to buy more. As far as I can see, only one nation wins from that arrangement, and it isn&#39;t little old us. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Anyway, recently, our toffy-nosed Prime Minister called parliament together for a special chat, even though it was in the middle of their long summer holidays - which I&#39;m sure they weren&#39;t too happy about. His idea was to get backing for his desire to help the bully bomb the people of Syria. I assume he (and his Slytherin cabinet colleagues) has shares in lots of weapons manufacturing companies, thus getting a tidy income from all the extra work he was planning to give them. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">But this time it didn&#39;t quite work out the way he&#39;d planned. After the lengthy debate, a vote was taken and parliament decided narrowly to reject the plan to blow loads more people to bits. Good for parliament. In fairness to the toff, he accepted the decision (though he had little choice) and has gone even further by saying that he won&#39;t keep coming back for more votes until he gets the answer he wants. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">For once, that all makes me proud to be British, proud of our limited democracy and unusually proud of the people who claim to represent us all. I&#39;m sure this government will find a way of getting its hands dirty, something clandestine and behind-the-scenes grubby, but at least on the face of it, we&#39;re staying well out of this one. We&#39;re not poking our collective noses in where they don&#39;t belong. We&#39;re finally not giving apparently laudable reasons for doing something, when the actual motive is a completely different, hidden one. For once, go us! </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">And if our political masters don&#39;t like it or are embarrassed in any way, so much the better.</span></span></p>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">When I was young, admittedly quite a long time ago now, there was a saying that had been around for a very long time. It was a saying that rang true and had a meaning, it was, &lsquo;Necessity is the mother of invention&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s not earth-shattering, it&rsquo;s not complicated or far-fetched. If there&rsquo;s a need for something, someone will invent it and make sure it does the job. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Since then, in those far-off, simplistic, innocent&nbsp;days, the world seems to have turned on its own head. It has become a more complex place with an ever more escalating desire for the next thing and the next, and probably the next. No one has time any more, no one has patience or anticipation. Everything must be now, and fast, and ultimately disappointing. The &lsquo;wait&rsquo; has gone out of the world.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">It seems now that scientists, who I generally have great respect for and some of whom number among my personal heroes, huddle in rooms &ndash; no longer smoke-filled, I&rsquo;m told, and therefore they&rsquo;re not scribbling on the backs of fag packets <font face=""Arial"" size=""3"">&ndash;</font> and talk long and hard about what they can invent next, what is possible. Irrespective of whether there is a need for it, or not. They then scuttle off to their labs, or underground bunkers, or evil lairs in mountain-top castles and invent away, with <font face=""Arial"" size=""3"">the &#39;If we build it, they will come&#39; mentality.</font></span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">They come up with things that no real person has asked for. Then they set the real villains of the piece, the marketing men and women, advertising agencies and the like, off on a mission to persuade everyone else that the thing that&rsquo;s been invented is something they can&rsquo;t do without.</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">And they&rsquo;re really clever at doing that. They pay an awful lot of money to people who are generally admired by the public at large (though probably not by me) to say how wonderful they think the newly invented thing is and how much fuller life is now that it&rsquo;s come along. How did they ever manage without it? How close would they have come to ending it all if it hadn&rsquo;t been thought up? Who cares?</span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Then the public of the world, or at least those living in what used to be known as decadent countries, who can afford the new thing, think, &lsquo;I can identify with that person, my life must be just like theirs (or at least, I&rsquo;d like to think so), somehow&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t do without this thing either, I must have one&rsquo;. They seem to forget that the person doing the persuading is probably, or usually&nbsp;a famous actor, someone whose whole job is to dress up and pretend. And, astonishingly, it all works. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I have seen a gadget, a small thing that you can carry around with you wherever you go. You can take it on short journeys or long ones, on any mode of transport you like. You can forget you&rsquo;ve got it with you for a while, or you can attend to its every whim. When you feel like it, you can take it out of your pocket or bag and plug it into your computer. Then a small miracle happens, it shows you where you&rsquo;ve been, or more accurately, where it&rsquo;s been. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Now, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a stranger to technology, or advancement, or for that matter technological advancement, but if it was me doing that the information would be pointless, I bloody know where I&rsquo;ve been, because I was there. I understand that it might be just a little useful, though probably more embarrassing than anything else, if I&rsquo;d been blind drunk for the previous few days and had no coherent idea where I&rsquo;d got to. But in those unlikely circumstances, I think I&rsquo;d actually prefer not to know. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">To me, someone&rsquo;s just cobbled together existing technology, stuff that helps people find places they&rsquo;re looking for, turned it on its head and then tried to get the world to believe they want it. That it will, in some way, actually be of use. It won&#39;t.&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s pointless. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Take the news story that broke last week about a beef burger, grown from cow stem cells in a lab rather than within a cow itself, over five years at a cost of more than 250,000 Euros. I understand the need to make better use of the resources we, collectively, have. I understand the need to produce food more economically and thoughtfully. After all, I&rsquo;m vegetarian for lots of reasons, not just because I don&rsquo;t like meat. But, is this The Answer? </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I don&rsquo;t think so. I think it&rsquo;s more because scientists managed to get funding based on spurious arguments and skewed science. They did it because they could rather than because they should; because the technology that allowed them to do so was there rather than because anyone actually wanted the resulting mock flesh pattie. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">The media here was gripped by the idea. For a day, they touted it as a &lsquo;cure&rsquo; for vegetarianism, guilt-free meat for veggies. How little they understand the world, how little the media care about the people who consume their prattlings. How wasteful it&rsquo;s all been, both in the short and longer-term. It seems we never learn, and neither can we go back to those innocent days when invention actually meant something. </span></span></p>"

"event","<p>I can&#39;t believe how long it&#39;s been since I last posted here. Where does the time go? I suppose it&#39;s a symptom of getting older, but it just seems to fly by. We&#39;re in August already and it feels like January was only a few days ago.

Having said that, I&#39;ve been very busy - at least, when I&#39;ve wanted to be. Settling into a, sort of, new job hasn&#39;t been very easy. I&#39;m doing a lot of what I did before, but with more of an emphasis on certain parts of it - web. That in itself is fine, but new surroundings and working in a new team has its pressures. But being able to work from home at least one day each week has definite advantages. There&#39;s a lot going on&nbsp; and I fear that when that all kicks in I&#39;ll have even less time. Never mind.

Much of my summer so far has been about leading up to a particular event, and that event happened on Thursday of last week. My parents had a very special wedding anniversary, their sixtieth! They had a blessing thingy in the village church, where they were married, and afterwards a garden party at home. Luckily, as anyone who&#39;s visited will know, it&#39;s quite a big garden, because there were about 90 people there.

As you can imagine, there was a lot of preparation leading up to Thursday, people arriving from all over, beds to be found if we couldn&#39;t put them up ourselves, and all the other stuff it takes to make something like that run smoothly. There were one or two hiccups along the way, like the garden marquee that decided to move to a different postcode area on the day before, but the great thing about an event like that is that it just happens, people get on with it and everything is fine. But, there are a few things I don&#39;t want to see again in a hurry - stacking chairs, gateaux and wasps!

But lots of things went right - the congratulatory message from the queen arrived bang on time, the weather was perfect, the bubbly was cold, the food and drink went down well, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves.

Clearing up after was almost as heavy a task as the preparation but could be done in a more leisurely way.

It was a great day, and most importantly, my parents enjoyed it. Whatever she may say, my mother loves being the centre of attention and that worked out a treat.

On a different note, I have lots of photos to post from the other things I&#39;ve been doing during the summer, visits and trips out, and I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll get round to that - soon, I hope.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>"

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I have to say, I love radio. I think, with some soul-searching, I actually prefer radio to television. I realise this is an enormous clich&eacute;, but I genuinely feel that the pictures are much better on radio. And, the weird thing is, given just how important music is to me (always) I don&rsquo;t really like music radio. The sort of radio programming that appeals to me most is the wonderful, human, enticing spoken word.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Many years ago I fell in love with BBC Radio 4, the ultimate in informative, enquiring and thought-provoking radio. And I&rsquo;m delighted to say that it has a little brother in New Zealand, National, which I spent a lot of time listening to when I was there. Some time ago Radio 4 became a bit intense though, just as the wonderful BBC decided to launch a rolling news and sport radio station called Radio 5. I switched to Radio 5. After that, 5 rebranded as BBC Radio 5 Live, and that is the station I listen to day and night, in the car, in bed, in the morning and in the bath. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Five live is broadcast on medium wave, and I like that. I like the crackles, the slightly off-station fuzziness and the fact that it kicks against modern trends just a little. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">But, about a week or so ago disaster struck. Suddenly my medium wave signal consisted of only a dull, continuous, impenetrable interference. In my head it was dark brown in colour. (As yet, I can&rsquo;t decide whether this is part of a much bigger and more serious issue still to be sorted which happened at more or less the same time and which has seen my broadband keep crashing, or if it works at all, it does so at a slug&rsquo;s pace.) </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I tried retuning my radio, and generally fiddling about, but it made no difference. It was still fine in my car, but every radio in the house was affected in the same way. In desperation I switched to FM and found BBC Somerset. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I listened to Somerset&rsquo;s own radio station for a couple of days, but it was dire and showed no signs of improving. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the case with everyone; I&rsquo;m sure there are people who love it, but to me, it seemed the most pointless waste of time and effort. BBC Somerset is unedifying, uninteresting and excruciating. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Again, in desperation, I came to the realisation that this couldn&rsquo;t go on. Something had to be done. I love Somerset, but its BBC radio output was rapidly doing my head in. I made a drastic decision. One day last week, Thursday I think it was, I made a detour on my way home from work and bought a DAB radio. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I work in a very digital world, there are moves afoot to even include the word &lsquo;digital&rsquo; in my job title. But I have to admit, here and now, that I&rsquo;m not a particular fan of digital broadcasting. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because I have little affection for television at all, but when we had the digital switchover here, I was reluctant, felt slightly persecuted and didn&rsquo;t like the idea. Presented with a situation that meant it was going to happen whether I stayed up to my thighs in mud or not, I bought the set-top box and put up with stuff. Of course, it&rsquo;s given me access to a few more interesting things, but on the whole it&rsquo;s given me access to a hell of a lot more crap to wade through. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">I haven&rsquo;t fiddled with the tuning on my new DAB radio. I just found Radio 4, Radio 4 Extra, Radio 5 Live and Radio 5 Sports Extra and then stopped pushing the buttons altogether. I know when I&rsquo;m happy, I know when I&rsquo;ve got enough to be going on with and I know when I&rsquo;m beaten. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: medium""><span style=""font-family: arial"">Now, I suppose I should turn my attention to what&rsquo;s causing problems with my broadband. I just hope it wasn&rsquo;t my router that zapped my medium wave. I hope it wasn&rsquo;t my medium wave zapping my router, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the router itself, but I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s the phone line either. I hate this stuff. </span></span></p>"

"event","<p>I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t been around much lately. I have tried to keep up with what everyone&#39;s doing though, so I haven&#39;t been completely absent. There are a number of reasons, the biggest being that I really haven&#39;t had much to say. The weather, on the whole, hasn&#39;t been that great and I haven&#39;t been out and about. Not being out and about tends to suggest not much opportunity to take interesting photos.

But, last weekend was a holiday here and I felt I had to use it well in some way. My aunt was staying so on the Monday I took her and my mother out for the afternoon. Last September, on what turned out to be just about the last day of summer, I went to the Bishop&#39;s Palace in Wells, with its beautiful gardens. And that&#39;s where we went on what could well have been the first day of this summer.

I set out with a bit of a plan, to look at the detail of the place. So these photos are all taken with my big lens, the small things in the bigger picture. I hope you like them, and the gorgeous spring sunshine.</p><lj-cut text=""Read more...millions of photos behind the cut"">

"event","<p>I&#39;m sorry for doing this today, three days early, but I&#39;m going away for a few days, well out of reach of the interweb, and I couldn&#39;t let the occasion slip by without me posting about it.

Friday 15 March is the birthday of my dearest friend, <lj user=""ilmera"" />. As a gentleman, I won&#39;t say how old she is but she is the perfect friend at any age.

We have known each other for about ten years now and, to paraphrase what she said about me on my birthday recently, she has a refined sense of humour, which has always seen us &quot;on the same wavelength&quot; even when we didn&#39;t know each other very well. Now that I know her much better, I can confirm that she has a million wonderful qualities - in no particular order - warmth, thoughtfulness, intelligence, wisdom, beauty, generosity, strength, understanding, curiosity, to name but a wee bunch.

It makes me incredibly proud to know her and to be her friend. I was like a dog with at least two tails when she came to visit earlier in the year. I was also honoured, while she was here, to be able to take some photos of her, photos I&#39;ve posted before, but a couple of which are posted again as a special tribute.

Happy Birthday, dear, from the bottom of my heart. You mean the world to me.

"event","<p>A couple of weeks ago, while my Dutch friends were visiting, we went to Tyntesfield house, near Bristol. I went there a few years ago, in September 2009 in fact - I&#39;ve just checked. It&#39;s a National Trust property and is still in the process of being done up. It&#39;s actually been a bit of a public project for the National Trust. Normally they would get a building ready before opening it to the public, but with this one they opened it straight away and then allowed the public to see the work of restoring it being done as they went along.

Of course, being cynical, I can&#39;t help thinking that was probably because they wanted some income more than offering it as a great idea for the public to see how they do the work, but that&#39;s the way of the world these days.

As I&#39;ve often said before, I&#39;m not particularly interested in the insides of places like this. I love to see how they fit into the landscape, and I love walking through the gardens, and above all, I love to take photographs. So, the others went in and I, sort of, wandered off. Being there at this time of year was the slight disappointment I had expected, with not much going on in the gardens, the kitchen garden almost bare and not a lot of colour around. But it&#39;s still a lovely place to be. Spring was beginning to make its presence felt, with snowdrops bursting out.

See what you think.

"event","<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but when I&#39;m going through a bit of a &#39;catch-up&#39; phase with my music collection (which already runs into literally thousands of CDs) I sometimes buy compilation albums. And very often I&#39;m disappointed by them.

So often a compilation CD will have a load of great music on it but it&#39;s been put together without much thought for the feel of the whole thing, and seems disjointed and clunky when you listen to it. To use a bit of a tired and worn-out phrase, the whole never quite matches up to the sum of the parts.

I think I have a bit of a talent for putting compilations together and making them work. Sometimes I like to make them tell a story, or have a theme beyond the music itself. Then, getting them to work well is a real labour of love for me, and when it comes off, it&#39;s great. I like to even go to the level of keys, instrumentation and rhythms to make sure that one track follows another fairly seamlessly, yet subtly changing and progressing them so that it all still sounds interesting.

I have a friend (who knows who she is) who I&#39;ve been putting some CDs together for. I&#39;ve covered various topics, told stories, travelled the land and done musical styles. But it has become obvious to me that there&#39;s also a bit of a case for taking a simpler approach. So, I&#39;ve decided to take, for example, a musical decade and create a &#39;Paul&#39;s best of...&#39; from it. I think I know, however diverse the music, or dissimilar it might be, I&#39;ll still be able to make it work.

I suppose an obvious place to start is the 1960s. I know it&#39;s a long time ago now, but so much of the popular music that has followed still owes its existence to, and is influenced by, the music of that incredibly creative and innovative decade. And much of the music of the &#39;60s still stands up, even if you&#39;re a long way from having been around at the time and, therefore, have little or no nostalgia for it.

Now, it became apparent to me very quickly that one compilation CD would never do the &#39;60s justice, and that thought opened up other ideas and possibilities, and we&#39;ll see how they develop. But, dear friends and readers, just for fun I have a question for you. It&#39;s a simple question and I&#39;d love to know your answers and what you think. I have my own ideas, and quite a lot of choice, but I could be missing something really obvious, so...

<b>If you were putting together one or more compilation CDs of music from the 1960s, what songs would you have to include?</b> (As many or as few as you like.) </p>"

"event","<p>There&#39;s something that&#39;s been getting my goat for a long time now. It&#39;s something that seems to have stealthily crept into daily life around here, and I&#39;m sure many other places as well, that I really disapprove of. And, I must say, this is purely a personal disapproval, but I feel I&#39;m not completely alone. I&#39;m sure there are those of you who find this phenomenon perfectly acceptable, useful even, and wouldn&#39;t do without it, but I find it sinister, unnecessary, obstructive and annoying.

What the hell is he talking about?

If you&#39;ll bear with me, I&#39;ll tell you.

We all have to grind out a daily life. We all have things to do that may not be as exciting or interesting as we&#39;d like them to be. In English they tend to be colloquially termed &#39;chores&#39;, and that&#39;s for a reason. Cleaning, tidying, cooking sometimes, washing, and, for me at least, especially shopping.

My&nbsp;disquiet is with the self-service tills that seem to be&nbsp;popping up&nbsp;more and more wherever you look.

When I do my shopping I like to go to a proper checkout. I like those few moments of interaction and communication with the person manning (or womanning, or girling, or boying) the till. I like the short, probably meaningless conversation, the questions, the platitudes, the smile, the hello, the goodbye. I like making a connection with someone, even if it&#39;s for only a moment or two. I don&#39;t expect to discuss my shopping choices in detail, to analyse what I&#39;ve bought and why, but, let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s nice to chat.

I&#39;ve been told that serving yourself saves you time. Well, my philosophy, my attitude, is to get up two minutes earlier, or better still, just to not be bothered. Has life really become so pressed, stressed and rushed that people can&#39;t spend&nbsp;a couple of moments waiting to be served? Has each slice of time become so precious that we feel the need to be duped into serving ourselves in shops? And no one is really fooled I&#39;m sure,&nbsp;time saving is&nbsp;not the real reason those tills are there anyway.

I&nbsp;flatly refuse to&nbsp;use self-service tills in supermarkets and other shops that have installed them. There are many reasons. I see them as a purely commercial expedient, a way of cutting back on staff and costs without appearing to discourage customers, while continuing to fill the already overburdened pockets of shareholders and conglomerates. One member of staff can watch over six or eight of these tills and respond to a flashing light like a trained pigeon when their help is needed. And in the meantime the customer is doing the work of the other five or seven members of staff who would have been needed to man (or woman, or girl, or boy) the tills if they were still the conventional sort. I won&#39;t be party to those people being put out of jobs&nbsp;for the sake of an apparent saving of a personal minute or two.

In fairness, these places still usually give you the choice of being served in the traditional way if you want, even though you are actively encouraged to go it alone, but that isn&#39;t really my complete gripe either. The thing that really, really annoys me is the perpetual running commentary of someone else&#39;s shopping you get if you&#39;re queued up near any of these tills.

&#39;Unexpected item in the bagging area&#39; indeed!

It must be hell for the men, women, girls or boys who sit there patiently doing a proper job, serving customers, for a whole working day with that monotonous racket going on constantly, &#39;Have you swiped your Nectar card?&#39;, &#39;Please take your change&#39;, &#39;How would you like to pay?&#39;, and again and again, &#39;Unexpected item in the bagging area&#39;. If it annoys me just passing through, it must make them gibber.

The other thing that makes me wonder about all this is, what next? Where will it all end? Will they expect me to get there a few minutes early so that I can do a spot of shelf-stacking for them before I start my shopping? If I get there really early, will they want me to open up for them? Will they want me to round up a few wayward trolleys and shepherd them back to the areas set aside for them in the car park? I already serve myself petrol, but will I soon be asked to give the tanks a scrub every now and then?

In short, the prices never seem to drop, but the level of service is constantly plummetting through the floor. I don&#39;t see that as either progress, or desirable.

If it carries on, one day they might just find an unexpected item in their bagging area. And that won&#39;t be pleasant for anyone.</p>"

The wild West&#39;s reputation is alive and kicking after police arrested a Greymouth woman for being drunk and disorderly on a horse.

The 48-year-old was warned by police to go home as she rode to Revingtons Hotel on Saturday night for a night out, according to an onlooker.

However, she refused, claiming there were no laws preventing people riding horses in the West Coast township so continued on her way.

Her steed tethered outside the pub attracted attention from patrons, prompting her to offer them rides around the town&#39;s centre for about half an hour or more.

&quot;She was leading the horse, just walking on the footpath and had a high vis jacket on. The young ones were enjoying it. People thought it was cool,&quot; said the onlooker, who asked to remain anonymous.

&quot;She was a little intoxicated but she was in control.&quot;

However, police were unimpressed and arrested her.

&quot;She tried to bring the horse into the hotel&#39;s reception to avoid them,&quot; the witness said.

It was possible the woman also tried to get her horse to kick the police and run them down, the witness said.

Officers pulled her off her horse, shocking patrons, who took cellphone videos of her arrest. A police spokeswoman said the woman was locked up for the night but only received a pre-charge warning.

Greymouth District Council&#39;s animal control officer impounded her horse but had since released it to its owner.

Happily, I&#39;ve had a lot more time with her mother in the past year, and that has been a real highlight for me.

When she was here in January Julia gave me a small book of photos of herself and Alice, many of them from photoshoots they had done together, and some of Alice on her own. She really is, like her mother,&nbsp;incredibly beautiful and I think these photos (which I hope I&#39;m not treading on anyone&#39;s toes by using) show that in spades. They are from a more recent shoot.

Happy Birthday Alice. I hope I&#39;ll be able to see you again soon in your wonderful city, and it would be&nbsp;a privilege&nbsp;to be able to spend some time with you here in England too.

"event","<p>I can&#39;t believe that two weeks have already gone by since I took these pictures. Julia and I made a brief foray into Wales. It wasn&#39;t deepest, darkest Wales, that&#39;s much further away. This was more a close, cuddly Wales, just over the bridge, turn right and up the Wye Valley for a few miles. Taking Julia to <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintern_Abbey"" target=""_blank"">Tintern Abbey</a></b> is something I&#39;d had in mind for a very long time. I hoped that she would like it as much as me; understanding the mystery, the serenity, the setting, the age and feel; the sense of loss and gain. As well as the little White Monk Tea Shop, selling divine toasted teacakes and a potent brew or two. I believe she did, and that pleases me beyond measure.&nbsp;

I&#39;ve been to Tintern Abbey lots of times before, and taken loads of photos there, so on this occasion I set out to do something a little different - detail. All those little nooks and crannies, the stones and craftsmanship. They are all part of the bigger picture, but when you see the bigger picture you don&#39;t always see the detail.

"event","<p>Well, I had a fantastic time with Julia, <lj user=""ilmera"" />,&nbsp;&nbsp;while she was here for her holiday in the UK. For me, it was the opportunity to put right the fact that we didn&#39;t get to spend enough time together during her previous visit last summer.

On 10 January I drove up to Heathrow terminal five to pick her up and get her back to Somerset. Her flight was early, so that gave us a great start for the homeward journey. In fact, we did so well that I was able to delay our meal stop until much closer to home. I made a little detour and we found ourselves walking into La Terre on Glastonbury High Street at about 8.30.

After our dinner we headed home, with predictable promises to return to Glastonbury before long.

I didn&#39;t take that many photos while she was here, for various reasons, but I think it&#39;s essential to post these first. I think I know how to take photos of landscapes and buildings, nature and gardens, but I have a huge hangup when it comes to taking photos of people. I&#39;m not sure what it is; insecurity, not really knowing what&#39;s expected, not knowing how to make it work, and above all, a big lacking in confidence. Whatever it is, it has shied me away from portraits.

But, having a stunning model come to stay meant that I had a stunning model come to stay; someone who knew what they were doing and who could gently guide me through what works and what doesn&#39;t. So, last Tuesday morning, in glorious winter sunshine, we went to Burrow Mump for the interesting backgrounds and ruins and had a bit of a session. She was fantastic and these photos are the result. And, after years of anticipation, it was a true honour to be able to take them.

More of what my wonderful friend and I did later.

"event","<p>I know that I&#39;m not around here as much as I would like, though I do try to keep up with my friends page even though I don&#39;t post as often as I should. That begs the question as to why I&#39;m posting now to say that I probably won&#39;t be around much over the next week or so.

Well, it&#39;s because my wonderful friend Julia is coming to visit. I&#39;m fetching her from Heathrow tomorrow. Her plane gets in from Saint Petersburg at about 5.45 tomorrow afternoon/evening. Then we&#39;ll have the fairly dull drive back to Somerset - with a meal stop on the way.

Once we&#39;re back I&#39;ll be able to relax and enjoy her company and the planning of what we&#39;re going to do and what we&#39;re going to see while she&#39;s here. There will, of course, be some of the visits I always seem to make when I have friends to stay. But, because hers is a winter visit, we will be guided largely by what the weather&#39;s going to do, and we can only really do that from day to day. Whatever happens, it will be great. Great to have some time off at this time of the year; great to have such wonderful company; and great to finally be able to show her my part of the world.

There will be a few hang-ups though. We still have lots of floods and things around. The road I use to get to and from work opened, after more than a month of closure because of flooding, just before Christmas. I used it for a couple of days. Then the rains came again, and it flooded again, and was closed again. It&#39;s still closed now. So, when I take Julia to Taunton on Friday, which I must, I will have to make the huge detour I have to make every day for work. That&#39;s a pain, but not a problem.

She will probably see Somerset without its glossy spring and summer coat of sunshine. I don&#39;t know how many sunny days we&#39;ll have. I love my area, but for about eight months of the year. From November to March it loses its green cosy appearance and instead takes on a greyness that is hard to describe. But at least we still have Glastonbury, Wells and other places with a mystical feel and appearance. And there are some places that are interesting at any time of the year, in any weather. So there will certainly be enough to do. And add in a day out in Salisbury and another in South Wales and I&#39;m sure we will end next week wondering where the time had gone. On top of that, of course, I will have the best of company to chase the winter blues away.

I&#39;m so looking forward to this holiday, being with Julia and showing her around, so, whatever the weather, I can&#39;t wait. And I&#39;m sure I will have photos to show for it.</p>"

"event","<p>I thought it was about time I did a little round-up of 2012.

On the whole I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a bad year. There has been the constant, underlying concern as to whether or not I&#39;ll still have a job from month to month, but I think that is becoming a bit clearer now, and it looks like I will. So, fingers crossed. And, from the day-to-day point of view, work has been quite good. I&#39;ve been very busy with lots to do, lots more to do and trying to fit it all in, but for the most part it&#39;s interesting stuff, stuff I enjoy doing and stuff that goes towards helping the people of Somerset. So I&#39;m happy with that.&nbsp;

I haven&#39;t been out and about as much as I would have liked in the past year, which is a shame, and I hope to put that right in 2013. A big thing that comes to mind for me is that 2012 was the first year for a very long time that I didn&#39;t actually leave the UK at some point. I didn&#39;t get on a plane in 2012, and as someone who sees themselves as a traveller, that&#39;s sad. Having said that, I have no travel plans yet for this year, but we&#39;ll see.

Rather than going out and finding the world, to a very large extent, the world came to me. Julia came to the UK for the first time&nbsp;in August and that meant I could meet up with her a few times, though not enough, and share some special moments with her. And, great news, she&#39;s coming back to stay for a little over a week in just a few days&#39; time, so 2013 gets off to a flying start. I&#39;m so looking forward to her visit and the pleasure we will have as I get to show her my part of the world.

And the other person who added a wonderful highlight to my year was Rebekka, who came to stay for ten days at the end of August. You may remember all the photos I posted of the places we visited together.

I&#39;ve also discovered, and rediscovered, lots of new and old music. There are a few highlights. Rebekka brought me a CD by a Norwegian band called Katzenjammer. They Are Fantastic! A Kiwi outfit called &#39;The Adults&#39; came to my attention as well. They are a supergroup of lots of well-established Kiwi musicians working together and producing cracking music. In the lead-up to Christmas, the UK department store, John Lewis, brought out a television advert which was, coincidentally, shot in New Zealand. It featured a backing track of a version of the old Frankie Goes to Hollywood song, &#39;The Power of Love&#39;, sung by a young Wiltshire lady called Gabrielle Aplin. It is astonishing. I&#39;m really looking forward to a new album from her in about April. She has a magical voice, a beautiful delivery and is, I&#39;m sure, destined to be huge. If you feel inclined, look her up on the interweb and marvel at just how accomplished she is.&nbsp;

Beth Orton brought out a new album last year, the first for a long time, and she has lost none of the all-round wonderfulness. And I filled a few gaps in my embarrassingly large CD collection by picking up &#39;Best of ...&#39; packages by people like (in no particular order) The Human League, Hawkwind, Sinead O&#39;Connor, The Hollies, Fairport Convention, The Stranglers, The Clash, The Who and many more besides. It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t have some stuff by them before, but rather that these collections &#39;rounded things off&#39; a bit.&nbsp;And there was another live Blur album rounding off the wonderful celebratory British summer.&nbsp;

So, what do I want for 2013? Well, in a lot of ways I&#39;d like more of the same. I want to get out and take photos. I want to share the gorgeousness of the area I live in with all of you. I want stories to tell and the talent to tell them well. I want to go back to Ireland and Scotland. I want to go further afield but understand that I will probably not be able to afford it. I want to know what&#39;s around the corner. Surely, that&#39;s not too much to ask.

May 2013 bring for you all the good things you wish yourselves.</p>"

"event","<p>Well, according to the doom-mongers and the people who delight in putting the proverbial up everyone else, the world is going to end in just over a week. Which, of course, it isn&#39;t. Apparently, and I know this has been lurking around trying to scare people for a while, the Mayans have run out of dates in their long calendar and some strange people believe that because of that the world will end. They seem to forget that the concept of a calendar, or indeed any way of measuring the passage of time, or indeed of predicting future events, is a human invention. It&#39;s not a concept that exists in anything other than the human mind.

Cats don&#39;t measure time, they&#39;re only really interested in food, warmth and sleep. Cows don&#39;t measure time, they just want to chew and emit methane. Pukekos don&#39;t measure time, they just wonder about where those outrageously unfashionable legs came from.

And the Mayans don&#39;t measure time because their ticking calendar has outlived their civilisation, and that same calendar didn&#39;t predict that.

Of course it&#39;s not going to happen, it never does. Predictions of doom and gloom come along as regularly as political scandals, and go away just as regularly too. Every cult and religion has a built-in doomsday (the difference between a cult and a religion is purely down to the number of people who sign-up to it) and every now and then someone comes along and says that judgement, doomsday, the end of the world, the rapture or whatever other invention they feel they need to control other people, is about to happen. And it never does. I can only assume that their followers are a really forgiving bunch because they never seem to drift away in droves to find someone else who will scare the crap out of them. They just carry on to the next predicted doomsday, subdued, obedient and exploited. Like sheep, who don&#39;t measure time because they&#39;re only really interested in pretty much the same things as cows.

If, by some astonishing chance, I&#39;m wrong, and I&#39;m open to that in the way that no member of a cult of any size seems to be, I hope you all enjoy the next few days - make the most of them, live each one to the fullest. Actually, that&#39;s not a bad philosophy at any time, doom or no doom.</p>"

"event","<p>As I said in my last entry, last Friday afternoon I went out and about, prepared to only get to the places I could get to, to take some photos of the flooding and the consequences of it for myself. I think the photos I&#39;ve posted so far have shown what things have been like very well, but I prefer to post my own photos rather than rely on someone else. So, here are my photos. Of course, I tend to look for the beauty in a situation rather than the drama, but I believe they still manage to tell the story even so.

My first destination was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrow_Mump"" target=""_blank"">Burrow Mump</a>. It&#39;s a high spot in a largely low-lying landscape and a good vantage point. It also happens to sit at the place where Somerset&#39;s two biggest rivers (the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tone"">Tone</a> and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Parrett"">Parrett</a>) meet. And that&#39;s where a lot of the trouble has stemmed from. Those rivers drain most of Somerset and when they are as full as they can be something has to give when they come together and what you see in these pictures is the result.

Looking across the submerged fields towards the Mump, with its iconic ruined church,&nbsp;gives a really good impression of what this landscape would have remained like without medieval landowners, farmers and engineers draining these places for the fertile soils beneath. They built drainage ditches, lake walls and defensive banks to keep the waters out. Those measures have done wonderful service over the hundreds of years they have been there, but at times like this they become the villains of the piece. Build a wall around something and nothing can get in, but if for whatever reason it does, then it can&#39;t get out again. The flood defences hold the water where it isn&#39;t wanted and the only way to remove it is by pumping it out, which takes a long time.

Mercifully, after the deluge we had a couple of weeks ago, we have had very little rain, that and the passing of the seasonal high tides and we seem to be heading in the right direction again. It&#39;s just a slow old job.

"event","<p>Well, not too much has changed since I last posted. It&#39;s stopped raining, more or less, but freeing up the local landscape from its lakiness is a very slow process. The thing is, ..... well, actually, the things are ..... that the whole area of The Somerset Levels is reclaimed land, land that has been designed to keep water out, so when it gets in it has nowhere to go. The defensive banks, walls and ditches start working in reverse and the only way to get rid of the inundation of water is to pump it. With an area this size it&#39;s a huge operation and takes a long time. Just one milliimetre of water spread over&nbsp;many hundreds&nbsp;of square kms is an awful lot of water. One metre of water over&nbsp;many hundreds&nbsp;of square kms is a thousand times more. They, the Environment Agency, don&#39;t clean the rivers out like they used to and that means that they are more prone to flooding when it comes because they have a reduced capacity to take the water away.

They are pumping. Apparently, they are pumping as fast as they can, the equivalent of an Olympic sized swimming pool every second, or so they say, but that&#39;s (if you&#39;ll pardon the pun) just a drop in the ocean.

The threat of flooding to homes has receded, receded in the sense that more homes are not likely to be affected, but the homes that have been still are. And, from a personally selfish point of view, the one major road in the area that is still impassable because of flooding is the very one I would normally use to get to and from work. So, I&#39;m still having to make a long detour in each direction, adding about an hour to, particularly, my homeward journey. Never mind, it could be worse.</p><lj-cut text=""Read more...Here are a few more photos that I've 'borrowed' from the BBC website."">

This one is fascinating. It shows Burrow Mump standing out surrounded by floods. It describes the landscape very well and also shows the&nbsp;impact of the flooding. The unbroken line of trees going from the base of the Mump to the top left corner of the picture&nbsp;flanks &#39;my&#39; road. I think I understand why it&#39;s closed! On Friday afternoon I had a bit of a look around and Burrow Mump was the obvious place to go to get a good look at how things were. I took photos, which I&#39;ll be posting in a day or two.

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: small"">Well, it&#39;s been an &#39;interesting&#39; time lately. The past week has been all go. When I drove to work last Wednesday morning it was raining. I didn&#39;t think much about that, after all, it rains a lot here. When I got to the village of Burrowbridge I noticed that the river seemed uncommonly high. This happens from time to time because Burrowbridge (where <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrow_Mump""><b>Burrow Mump </b></a>is) is quite a long way downstream on the River Parrett and any rain that&#39;s fallen in the south of Somerset can take a couple of days to get there. But the river really was very high, probably as high as I&#39;ve ever seen it. That isn&#39;t so remarkable because if it had been any higher it would have been spilling over, so it would be really unusual to see it higher than it could possibly be. If you see what I mean.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">Anyway, I continued on my way to work. When I got in there weren&#39;t many people around but there was still a bit of a bluster going on with people busy creating special webpages for all the flooding news. I had to get to grips with it all fairly quickly and help out, mostly by taking work off people so they could concentrate on getting the flooding news pages up. At the end of my working day I went home as normal. On Thursday it was still all going on, and more importantly, still raining. This time there were people around with tales of their struggles getting into work and the problems they&#39;d had at home.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">I should point out at this point that the photos I&#39;ve used here are not mine. Mostly I&#39;ve snagged them from <b><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/england/somerset/"">the local BBC website</a>.</b></span></p><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Scenes of devastation""><br /><br /><a href=""http://blur-kiwi.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/63961/1309668"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""railway bridge templecombe"" height=""360"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/blur_kiwi/10271418/1309668/1309668_original.jpg"" title=""railway bridge templecombe"" width=""640"" /></a><br />This railway bridge is in the south east of Somerset.<br /><br />On Friday, again, I went into work as normal. As usual I left at lunchtime and, on my way home, I came to a bit of a grinding halt as the road I was using was under water. I got through but knew that I would have been one of the last to manage it, and indeed, it was closed by the time I got home five minutes later, according to the BBC website.<br /><br /><a href=""http://blur-kiwi.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/63961/1309882"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""A361"" height=""360"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/blur_kiwi/10271418/1309882/1309882_original.jpg"" title=""A361"" width=""640"" /></a><br />And this is that road, the one I normally use to get to work.&nbsp;It wasn&#39;t quite as bad as this&nbsp;when I drove through it on Friday, but it wasn&#39;t far off. I think I can see why they closed it.<br /><br />On Saturday morning I decided that going to Taunton to do my weekly shop would need a detour through Bridgwater, and an even longer detour on the way home to avoid Bridgwater.<br /><br />Monday morning, and by now you must understand we had had about 150mm of rain since Wednesday - all of it fallen on already really sodden ground from a wet spring, summer and autumn, and I thought I would give my usual way to work a bit of a go. I went over the bridge at Burrowbridge - the river was exactly as high as it was possible to be - to see a lake in front of me where the road should have been. Happily, I still had a couple of detour options and took one that I thought would be open. It was, though there were a few landslips and enormous puddles and running water along the way.<br /><br />I was busy updating flooding webpages most of the day and saw discretion as the better part of valour for my homeward journey, so went the (very) long way round. Last night the road blockage came off of the BBC website, but the person I car share with didn&#39;t feel inclined to give it a go this morning, so we came to Taunton through Bridgwater again. I&#39;m pretty sure it&nbsp;was clear earlier, but it looks like it&#39;s been closed off again now, so I think it will be the long road home again tonight. I hope it is finally opened up again soon, as the waters recede.<br /><br /><img alt=""levels"" height=""360"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/blur_kiwi/10271418/1310274/1310274_original.jpg"" title=""levels"" width=""640"" /><br />My beloved <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Levels""><b>Somerset Levels</b></a> and the way&nbsp;they look now.<br /><br /><a href=""http://blur-kiwi.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/63961/1310068"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""bath"" height=""360"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/blur_kiwi/10271418/1310068/1310068_original.jpg"" title=""bath"" width=""640"" /></a><br />Many of you will recognise this scene. I&#39;m sure a lot of you have stood near this spot by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulteney_Bridge""><b>Pulteney Bridge</b></a> and Weir in Bath. Well, it doesn&#39;t always look like this.<br /><br />Having said all that, my inconvenience has been all very minor really and some people have had a real nightmare with homes being flooded, and serious disruption. A couple of people in Somerset have died in the floods and the high winds that came along with them. Most of the roads in the south-west have been impassable at some time or another and the emergency services have been flat out for days. Whole communities have been cut off and railway lines have been washed away.<br /><br />It&#39;s stopped raining now, and it looks like things are slowly getting back to normal, but it&#39;s been quite a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></lj-cut><br />"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: small"">At the end of last week I had a meeting with a couple of colleagues at the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury to talk about improving their web information. To start with, it&#39;s always a pleasure to go to Glastonbury, and I love visiting the museum. It&#39;s great that Somerset&#39;s heritage is managed by part of the organisation I work for. Better still, I was asked by another colleague to take some photos of the museum while I was there - photos that might be used to help promote the museum and add a splash of colour to the aforementioned web information. I don&#39;t get working days like that very often, so I was determined to make the most of it.<br /><br />The meeting went very well, with lots of enthusiasm shown and the understanding that something had to be done, and between us we could get it sorted and improved. One big topic was the fact that the museum is going through a bidding process for funding to get the place refurbished. And it sorely needs it. It opened in the 1970s and hasn&#39;t really had much attention since then. It&#39;s very worthy and&nbsp;does a fantastic job, telling the story of country life in Somerset - mostly from a Victorian point of view - and preserving dying arts, ways of farming and living off the land, and showing&nbsp;just what life was like for real country people in times gone by.</span><br /><br /><img alt=""zzIMG_6097_1"" height=""467"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/blur_kiwi/10271418/1309263/1309263_original.jpg"" title=""zzIMG_6097_1"" width=""700"" /><br /><br />The orchard has long-lost varieties of apple trees and even a few sheep, rare breed Portlands.

In the past couple of weeks I have seen some lovely northern hemisphere autumn photos on my friends page, and thought it was about time I made a contribution.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">So last weekend, with Saturday being actually sunny, I drove up onto the nearby Quantock Hills to see whether &#39;the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness&#39; had kicked in. And, the answer was mixed. Yes, some things were showing real signs of autumn, some trees had turned to beautiful colours, while others were being a bit awkward and hanging on to their summer clothes beyond their sell-by date.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">I started by dropping in on Hawkridge Reservoir, which is usually a lovely spot. It was still fairly &#39;green&#39; there. So on I went through and above the village of Over Stowey. This was more like it. I stopped in a few places to take photos, including a lovely bit of open ground with a gorgeous view across to the Bristol Channel and the Welsh coast beyond. Then I headed down the other side of the hills, stopping when I found&nbsp;a couple of rows of&nbsp;perfect-looking beech trees, to the village of Crowcombe, before heading home.</span><br /><br

With a bit of luck, and the hope that I don&#39;t go into my shell and just not bother, I should be able to post some photos again next week.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">In the meantime, here&#39;s the final installment of my answers to the thirty day meme.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">26. <b>Your perfect night out</b><br />My perfect night out is one where, first and foremost, I&#39;m not driving. It would be a dinner party with lots of the people who are most important to me, the best company I can imagine. There would be lots of veggie food, lots of great New Zealand wine, some background music and lots of laughter and sparkling conversation. Followed by really good coffee. Having said that, I suppose what I&#39;ve just described is also my perfect night in. Interesting.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">27. <b>Whether you like to plan ahead or be spontaneous</b><br />I&#39;ve answered a lot of these statements in a very woolly, non-committal sort of way, and this is yet another example. I think I like both. There are times when it&#39;s great to just let things happen, not to make definite plans as circumstances change. To make the right decision in the right circumstances without any committment to what turns out to be the wrong decision. Yet it&#39;s also good to have things to look forward to, to plan ahead a bit. Both have their place and I&#39;m open to the right one at the right time. There, that didn&#39;t really answer that at all, did it?</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">28. <b>What you look for in a friend</b><br />I think you can usually describe the people who are my friends with more than a few of these attributes. They are: warm, tolerant, gentle, kind, funny, sparky, interesting and interested, creative, thoughtful, knowledgeable, imaginative, humanitarian, open, curious, musical, literary, honest.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">29. <b>Whether you&#39;re a night owl or a morning lark</b><br />For most of my life I&#39;ve had to get up early for work. Most jobs I&#39;ve had have meant that an early start is helpful or required. And that&#39;s never been a problem because I think I&#39;m that morning lark. This always makes me laugh, but I can remember as a child looking forward to every opportunity to stay up even a few minutes later than normal. &#39;Great, I can stay up a bit later.&#39; Now, and this is what I find funny, if there&#39;s no one around and nothing special to accommodate, I like to think, &#39;Great, I can go to bed earlier!&#39; So, not a night owl, then!</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">30. <b>How you would like people to remember you</b><br />I think, if people remember me at all, then that&#39;s an achievement. And to be remembered fondly, that&#39;s better still - I would have touched other lives in some way. I would like to be thought of as kind, honest, creative, caring and funny. I was asked, at a course I attended recently, to describe myself in five words, and I chose - writer, friend, photographer, traveller, fool. And they would be great things for others to remember me by, I think. That&#39;s not bad.</span></p>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: small"">And here&#39;s the fifth chunk of the thirty day meme. There&#39;s some heavier stuff in this lot, and something I rarely do - voicing my own opinions about subjects that convention says we shouldn&#39;t discuss in polite society. I don&#39;t expect people to necessarily agree with my views, and they are just that - my views. But I hope everyone will understand and accept that I should answer as fully as I can. If you do agree, then I&#39;m happier than ever; if you don&#39;t agree, it doesn&#39;t change anything.<br /><br />21. <b>Who you have a crush on</b><br />That changes with the weather. Most of the time, no crush at all, but there are a couple of recurring themes. I have a permanent crush on Julia, <lj user=""ilmera"" />&nbsp;, simply because I crave her company and am, for the most part, denied it because of geography. For many years I&#39;ve had a sort of crush on Jennifer Connelly, but as I don&#39;t understand the cult of celebrity, I find that a bit baffling too. There are a couple of people I see in the corridors at work who I think of as people I would like to get to know better sometime, but that&#39;s about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />22. <b>A friendship you lost</b><br />Bit painful, this. I had a very close friend who, a few years ago, did something I disagreed with and disapproved of. That in itself was fine. She then wanted me to support her in those choices in a civil court case she brought against her former partner, which I wasn&#39;t prepared to do, because it would be against my better judgement and conscience. When it became obvious that I wasn&#39;t going to be untrue to myself to support her in, what I saw as a bogus claim on someone else, I was dropped, like a stone. A shame, but at least my conscience is clear.<br /><br />23. <b>Three achievements you&#39;re proud of</b><br />I really don&#39;t know. I&#39;m proud of being friends with a lot of the people I&#39;m friends with. Is that an achievement? I think so. I&#39;m proud of the award to do with my work, that I won a couple of years ago - recognition of a job well done in difficult circumstances is always encouraging. I&#39;m proud of my LiveJournal, because it is a true and honest reflection of me and the way I am and the things I do. I think that counts. Just in case one of those doesn&#39;t count, and I need a kind of stand-by achievement to be proud of, I&#39;m proud that I have a creativeness within me that sometimes surfaces and does good stuff.<br /><br />24. <b>Your political views</b><br />I&#39;m not a particularly political person, but I do have views. Those views are mostly to do with what I don&#39;t like, don&#39;t want to see and don&#39;t want to happen, rather than what might be good. I sometimes seeth inside when I see things, hear things or read things, and don&#39;t very often express my own opinions. But I&#39;ll voice them here just this once. My political views are very &#39;left of centre&#39;. Right wing politicians and political ideas genuinely frighten me because they generally don&#39;t take into account real people and the effect they have on them and their lives. Those complete nutters in, or represented by - in this country and their like in other countries - the <b>Conservative</b> party (and their supporters - I really do see them as the embodiment of <b>Slytherin</b>) seem to me to be responsible for most of the bad things in the world. When there is a mass shooting, or outrageous act (like last year&#39;s appalling events in Norway, for instance) it&#39;s always someone with extreme right wing views that&#39;s at the centre of it. Us lefties seem to be a lot more tolerant. Although it&#39;s nothing to do with me, not being my country and everything, I see the election stuff in America at the moment and completely dispair. I have an idea, perhaps they should save all the ridiculous amounts of money they spend on campaigning and just decide who gets in by working out which candidate has fewest books in their house! That seems to be pretty much the level they work at.<br /><br />I&#39;m a people person, more aligned to the helping hand than the iron fist. I can&#39;t help thinking that, if countries like mine spent a lot less on trying to impose their views on others, killing people from other cultures, and planning to do those things, and spent more on education, health care and support for the disabled, the whole world might be a better place. Spend a lot less on pointless weapons and the people who seem to delight in wielding them and a lot more on schools and the people who go to learn in them - that&#39;s what I believe. Stop trading in death and support life, understanding and knowledge.<br /><br />25. <b>Your religious beliefs</b><br />The honest answer to this is, &#39;I don&#39;t have any.&#39; I can&#39;t accept organised religion as anything other than a human invention designed to keep other people in their place. I can&#39;t accept spiritual stuff&nbsp;as anything other than wishful thinking and hope. The absolute truth is that no one knows. They may hope, they might wish, they might expect, but they can&#39;t know. I can&#39;t believe in things I can&#39;t touch or understand, and I can&#39;t accept anyone else&#39;s made up stories as anything other than that.<br /><br />But, I can fully respect other people&#39;s views, and if they choose to believe, hope or expect, I will not say they are wrong. As I see it there is no evidence at all for them being right, but the choice is entirely theirs. If they get something fulfilling and rewarding out of it, that&#39;s wonderful. But even so, don&#39;t expect me to think the same.</span></p>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: small"">So, on to the fourth chunk of the thirty day meme. Sorry I didn&#39;t update over the weekend. And then I had yesterday off work, though I didn&#39;t do much with it because of the wet and windy weather. I really want to get out and take some autumn photos, even if they&#39;re just of the village I live in and the fields around it. Fingers crossed for next weekend, providing the weather plays its part. In the meantime...</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">16. <b>Your worst illness</b><br />Touching wood, I haven&#39;t really had a serious illness. I had an operation to sort out a hernia when I was two years old, but I don&#39;t really remember anything about that. My only memory of that at all is of a photograph taken of me (I remember seeing the photo, not the event) being handed a rose by Princess Alexandra in my hospital bed when she was, apparently, visiting Bridgwater to open the lido. I was in the hospital bed, you understand, not Princess Alexandra, and my hospital bed was not in the lido. Happily, I was much too young and untainted for royalty to rub off on me, and have remained that way ever since.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">17. <b>What you do at work</b><br />Where do I start? I produce and maintain information for the public about the Adult Social Care services provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority where I live. I also maintain and approve content for a large chunk of the website and sometimes train other people to use the system. I help people with the content of other websites as well and have even been known to come up with the odd brilliant idea to save someone else&#39;s bacon. I turn council jargon into real words and make sure it can be understood by as many people as possible. I advise other people to use plain English and run training sessions sometimes. I make that funny when I can because it would be dry old stuff otherwise. I put together a couple of staff newsletters and edit content for others. I also, sometimes, write articles for a free newspaper produced by the council, that goes to every home in the area. I advise people about the accessibility of information to make sure it reaches the right audience, and as big an audience as possible. Sometimes I have to take photos as part of my job, so that&#39;s fun! It&#39;s a varied and mostly interesting job and I really like it, though I wish, as everyone else does I&#39;m sure, that it would pay a bit more. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">18. <b>A question or comment people should never make to you</b><br />I&#39;m a pretty open and relaxed person, so there isn&#39;t much that&#39;s out of bounds for me. If someone wants to try to wind me up a bit, they can mention how much they believe about religion in general, or right wing politics in particular, but I&#39;m fairly forgiving and take people for what and who they are rather than what they necessarily believe in. There are people who are very important to me who I disagree with on fairly fundamental things, but that doesn&#39;t stop us being close because the contentious issue just never has to come up.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">19. <b>The style of clothing you feel most comfortable in</b><br />I&#39;m not one for dressing up. I still see wearing a proper shirt for work, with a collar and everything as &#39;fancy dress&#39;. I&#39;m most comfortable in a t-shirt or rugby shirt, baggy chinos and odd socks. I do like wearing my kilt, but that doesn&#39;t happen very often.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">20. <b>Whether you&rsquo;re an extrovert or an introvert</b><br />I suppose I&#39;m a bit of both. I don&#39;t like to push my head up over the parapet very much but I do like to be noticed for doing interesting and creative things. I&#39;m not socially inept, but I like my own company quite a lot. I feel that I don&#39;t have to make a statement to be with the people who matter most to me. Oscar Wilde once said that there is only one thing worse than &#39;being noticed&#39;, and that&#39;s &#39;not being noticed&#39;. A small part of me agrees with that, but a much bigger part of me thinks the opposite. There, pick the bones out of that one!</span></p>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: small"">Again, I&#39;m continuing with the thirty day meme in just a few days. So, here&#39;s the next slice. As I said before, I&#39;m really enjoying doing this and I hope you&#39;re finding it a bit enlightening too. I see it as a bit of a chance to say a&nbsp;little more about myself, that I probably wouldn&#39;t feel was appropriate to include in a &#39;normal&#39; entry. That and the fact that a lot of this stuff just wouldn&#39;t crop up.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">11. <b>Your kids, or your feelings about having kids</b><br />I&#39;ve never wanted children. There are some who see that as selfish (I&#39;ve heard it all), and others who see life as meaningless unless you invest in the future in some way. I think that&#39;s all bollocks. I think the world of some of my friends&#39; children, and I couldn&#39;t envisage a world without those wonderful people in it, but you can give those back, can&#39;t you. So, not wanting children doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t like children, and that&#39;s something some people can&#39;t seem to see. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">12. <b>Your pets, past and present</b><br />There have been a lot of pets, one way and another. I grew up having pet lambs on the farm. There have always, until recently, been cats and even the occassional dog. I&#39;m not really a dog person, and much prefer cats, but a few have got through to me in the past. I do miss having a cat around, since Buster died a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years ago, but it probably wouldn&#39;t be fair - with all the awkward comings and goings and not being around&nbsp;- to have one just now.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">13. <b>Foods you love and foods you hate</b><br />Well, being vegetarian, the &#39;foods I hate&#39; bit is quite easy. To the hate, or at least strongly dislike, list I can add, eggs, milk, coriander leaves, and aubergine. I love curries and veggie chillies, and a lot of vegetarian Italian dishes. I love cooking, and experimenting with what goes with what, and have come up with some cracking things over the years. (My green vegetables with pumpkin and pine nut ravioli, with a balsamic onion sauce, walnuts, fresh leaves and blue cheese, is a triumph! Even though I say so myself.) Sadly, I don&#39;t always have time for that.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">14. <b>What your life was like ten years ago</b><br />It was very different. Ten years ago I was working as the manager of a nationwide distribution unit in an agricultural service industry. (Not as grand as it sounds, and it doesn&#39;t really sound very grand!) I had hardly picked up a camera, and certainly not a digital one. I had not met, or even known of the existance of, a lot of the people who are now my closest friends. I was content, to the point that I probably didn&#39;t have a clue about a lot of the things I really wanted and certainly had no knowledge of things that I now consider vitally important. So, perhaps, instead of&nbsp; &#39;content&#39;, you could say, &#39;clueless&#39;.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">15. <b>How much alcohol you drink</b><br />Not much, really. Honest! I quite like a cider, beer or pear cider with my evening meal, and love a good glass or so&nbsp;of Central Otago Pinot Noir (as well as appreciating a good Marlborough Pinot Gris) whenever the chance arises. But I&#39;m always conscious of the fact that I have to drive in the morning and won&#39;t drink because of that. There are, admittedly, rare times when something like a dinner party allows me to savour a bit more wine, but generally it really isn&#39;t very often.</span></p>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: small"">Continuing the thirty day meme thingy, in just a few entries. I&#39;m enjoying doing it. It&#39;s a bit searching and a bit different, and it&#39;s also a chance to talk about me and what makes me tick, rather than just the stuff I do. Though I really don&#39;t know how interesting it is for anybody else. So here goes...</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">06. <b>Your favourite and least favourite subjects at school</b><br />I loved Geography at school, but couldn&#39;t pass exams in it. Though I&#39;m a firm believer that exams and qualifications are extremely over-rated anyway. I loved finding out about places, people and how the whole thing was put together. My least favourite subject was Mathematics. Maths was completely pointless to me. I learnt nothing useful after about the age of six, yet had to suffer it for another ten meaningless years. I have become a words person, and am not in any way a numbers person, and I think that might be as much a reaction to the pointlessness of learning Maths as any aptitudes I may have.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">07. <b>Your first boyfriend or girlfriend</b><br />When I was fourteen I fell hopelessly in love with a girl from the year above me at school. Our relationship lasted about six months and afterwards I felt very guilty, even though in all honesty, we both contributed to it breaking up. It&#39;s a weird thing, but that first relationship seems to leave deeper scars than often more meaningful ones from later. I realise that&#39;s a bit of a clich&eacute;, but in my case I think it&#39;s true.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">08. <b>Your oldest hobby</b><br />I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s probably travelling. I was lucky enough to have had parents who believed that travelling and experiencing new and different cultures was as much a part of a good education as sitting in a classroom. I spent summers living with a family in France from the age of eleven, and have always had it in me to travel, explore and discover. I may not be the most adventurous person in the world, but I still like being somewhere new.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">09. <b>Your sexuality</b><br />Heterosexual. I once had someone ask me on a plane (the first thing she said to me, in fact) whether I was gay. When I told her that I wasn&#39;t, she said, &#39;Well, you look gay.&#39; I don&#39;t know quite what that means, and I don&#39;t think I do, but I&#39;m not. Having said all that, homophobia really gets my back up and angers me more than almost anything else. Leben und leben lassen - probably. And the sooner our political masters in this country recognise the right of gay people to marry if they wish to, rather than the sham and more than slightly ridiculous&nbsp;&#39;Civil Partnership&#39;, the better.<br /><br />10. <b>What you look for in a partner</b><br />I&#39;m not looking for a partner, but if I were they would probably be (in no particular order), human, funny, knowledgeable, wise, politically well left of centre, compassionate, thoughtful, open-minded, undramatic and tolerant. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s asking too much! Most of all, of course, they would have to be someone I really enjoy being with and sharing things with</span>.</p>"

What you look for in a friend<br />29. Whether you&#39;re a night owl or a morning lark<br />30. How you would like people to remember you<br /></lj-cut><p><br /><span style=""font-size: small"">01. <b>Your name</b><br /><b>First name</b> - Paul. It&#39;s gone in and out of favour with me over the years. Sometimes I&#39;ve really hated it, and others - it&#39;s not so bad. The biggest thing I dislike about it is that it can&#39;t be shortened. I don&#39;t believe in things like names having meanings which describe the person who has that name. That&#39;s impossible. A couple of people making a choice based on their own opinion cannot determine how someone&#39;s going to turn out.<br /><b>Middle name</b> - Jonathan. It&#39;s something I&#39;m completely indifferent to, because I never use it or answer to it. It&#39;s just there.<br /><b>Surname</b> - Crosier. This is one I like. It&#39;s an old Scottish borders name - probably with a French origin. There are still Crosiers in the borders now, but we, my particular lot, somehow escaped and wound up in the south-west of England. That&#39;s a long story and I don&#39;t know all of it. But still, it has a colourful heritage. Crosiers feature in some of the gruesome border ballads from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and were a reiving family on the wrong side of someone or other&#39;s law quite often.<br /><br />02. <b>All the places you&#39;ve lived</b><br />I haven&#39;t moved around much. I spent my childhood in the house I live in now. I moved out when I started work and went to a village called Brockenhurst in the New Forest in Hampshire. I was only there a few months before I got a job back in Somerset, on the edge of a town called Ilminster. I luckily had a cottage with my new job and lived there for 15 years before changing jobs to one without a cottage, and I then had to move back home because I couldn&#39;t really afford to do anything else. I couldn&#39;t really say that I &#39;lived&#39; in New Zealand (though I would love to be able to), especially as I moved around, but I was there longer than I was in Brockenhurst!<br /><br />03. <b>Your first best friend</b><br />My first best friend is still one of my best friends now. I met Si on my first day at Grammar School. We don&#39;t see each other that often, perhaps a handful of times a year, but we&#39;ve known each other for ever it seems, shared some great experiences, both in growing up and later, and know where the other is if we need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />04. <b>Your childhood fears</b><br />I think I had a pretty happy childhood. I don&#39;t remember being fearful or afraid. I wasn&#39;t old enough to fear growing up, though I now wish I had (or hadn&#39;t, if you see what I mean!) I wasn&#39;t aware enough to fear the realities of the wider world. I feared punishment if I did, or felt I had done, something wrong. And I often got that punishment if I hadn&#39;t done anything. But that&#39;s not so unusual, I think.<br /><br />05. <b>What you were like in high school</b><br />I was probably an obnoxious little turd. I didn&#39;t really fit in with the sporty crowd (I&#39;m pleased to say) and I didn&#39;t fit in with the really bright kids, who just didn&#39;t really fit in anyway. The thing that garnered me friends was a love of music, like-minded boys (and sometimes girls) who loved the wild, self-indulgent music of the day. I think I was brighter than my achievements suggested, and wise enough not to show off.</span></p>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: small"">The Saturday before last was, quite possibly, the last warm, sunny day of the summer. The year is marching on, autumn is definitely in the air and summer feelings are disappearing rapidly with the sunshine. It was a beautiful day and, for all the reasons I&#39;ve just given, I didn&#39;t want to miss out on it.<br /><br />I made a decision and set off. <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells"">Wells</a></b> is a lovely place. It&#39;s England&#39;s smallest city, with one of its biggest impressive cathedrals. Wells is only a drive of about half an hour away from my home, so I go there a few times each year; I never tire of the beauty and peaceful feel of the place. Of course, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Cathedral""><b>the cathedral</b></a> is a big attraction for anyone who visits Wells, as is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicars%27_Close,_Wells""><b>the Vicars&#39; Close</b></a> - a gorgeous street with really old houses either side.<br /><br />Another attraction is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Palace,_Wells""><b>Bishop&#39;s Palace</b></a> and its gardens. Amazingly, until that sunny Saturday, I had only ever been to the Bishop&#39;s Palace once before. Twenty years ago I went to an event there as part of the Wells Literary Festival - twenty years, I&#39;ve just checked and it really was that long ago. It was a lecture by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett""><b>Terry Pratchett</b></a>, who is still my favourite author.<br /><br />So, on that sunny Saturday I put things right. I had often wondered how people could take photos of the cathedral from an angle I wasn&#39;t familiar with, and reflect it precisely into a pond. Now I know, they visit the Bishop&#39;s Palace, and walk through the gardens until they reach the feature that gives the city its name. In medieval times these wells, naturally occurring springs, supplied Wells with all the water it needed to function as a commercial centre. While most of that is gone, there are still gullies in the High Street with water flowing through them.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this little gem of a garden as much as I did. It&#39;s typically English, perfectly delightful and well worth a special visit.

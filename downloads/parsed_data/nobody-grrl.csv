<TD>Be prepared to have your life story shot entirely in New York City -- though lately Woody's been loving shooting in London. Also, your music soundtrack is all jazz from before 1949. Filmography: Annie Hall, Manhattan, Stardust Memories, Everyone Says I Love You, etc. Woody has released one film per year consistently for the past 35 years. For the past 15 years he's been trying to make films like his older, funnier ones, just like characters in his Stardust Memories film suggest throughout. Regardless of his personal life, his films are American classics. </TD></TR>

What is the point at with caffeine consumption is excessive and harmful? If one needs the substance just to feel normal is one at this point?

Why is spacecraft dynamics at night? Why can't it be in the middle of the day so I don't have to brave to cold just to listen to a bunch of stuff that goes way over my head and then struggle home through the tundra? I know that technically Los Angeles is not in the Artic circle but I don't care. Aurora borealis would be pretty sweet though.

Should I go to my sorority invite or the engineering formal? My boss will be at one but the invite is toga themed (gross).

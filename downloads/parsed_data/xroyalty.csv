"event","destiny is mad @ stephanie because she said that kyle said that dstiny and vaughn should go out because they are both black.. i kno that stephanie didnt mean it in that way..its just becaue kyle is an ass and he would think that so i guess steph was just putting it from kyles point of view:
CarameL baBii  x [8:20 PM]:  destiny wanted me to tell u something 
 PRQT17 [8:21 PM]:  oh wat  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:22 PM]:  destiny said she got mad at you when u said tht kyle only said that she should go out with vaughn just because they are both black and she said that if anyone else sais something about her skin color or race she'll slap them and she also sais that she wants to let jennifer and every know about how she feels 
 PRQT17 [8:23 PM]:  i was talking about her skin color in general she is taking to far  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:23 PM]:  wait say it again i dont understand 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:25 PM]:  ?? 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:26 PM]:  stephanie are u there 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:27 PM]:  :-( ?? 
 PRQT17 [8:31 PM]:  first we were talking edwin and gigi asked something  about his nationality and i said he was half black half daminican and then jenn is like oh he is and i am like yeah you cant be black without some1 being black in ur family and then i used destiny as an example and i go destiny is half black and hacve costa rican she cant be the color she is if she doesnt have a family member that is black and then destiny is like oh yes u can and i am like no u cant and then she is like mexicans are i am like no they .. 
 PRQT17 [8:31 PM]:  are dark tan  
 PRQT17 [8:31 PM]:  and then she just rolled her eyes  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:32 PM]:  hold on im reading 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:33 PM]:  but thats not wat she got mad it 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:33 PM]:  or what she told mee 
 PRQT17 [8:33 PM]:  if she gonna be like that go ahead i was talking about her once and then i was talking about ppl in general and she aint gonna slap me because i didnt do shit  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:33 PM]:  but shes talkinf about the thing with kyle vaughn and her 
 PRQT17 [8:34 PM]:  oh i said maybe he only said that cuz u black or u are both tall  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:34 PM]:  yea i get ur point but she doesnt 
 PRQT17 [8:35 PM]:  because she wont listen   
 CarameL baBii  x [8:35 PM]:  she thinks that u meant that black people only go with blacks or sumtin g 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:35 PM]:  i think u gotta tell her this in person bc i dont want any missunderstandings 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:35 PM]:  just talk it over so she gets what u meant 
 PRQT17 [8:36 PM]:  i told her i didnt mean it like that  
 PRQT17 [8:37 PM]:  she is just caught up in wat she thinks right now i will tell her tomorrow but she probably wont listen like she does cuz she always rolls her eyes at me  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:37 PM]:  oh 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:37 PM]:  i hope u guys really talk this out 
 PRQT17 [8:38 PM]:  i dont really care if she is gonna be like that  
 PRQT17 [8:39 PM]:  she knows i didnt mean it like that i always go no affense  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:39 PM]:  she just misunderstood she's still the same destiny she always was just talk to her and let her kno that u meant no harm 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:39 PM]:  she's feel better once she's heard it from u..u kno just to clear things up 
 PRQT17 [8:40 PM]:  but still she knows me better than that  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:40 PM]:  ur rite 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:42 PM]:  but sometimes its the way the person feels  that makes them see things differently 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:43 PM]:  just try to talk to her 
 CarameL baBii  x [8:43 PM]:  or do u want me to 
 PRQT17 [8:43 PM]:  u to  
 CarameL baBii  x [8:44 PM]:  ok i'll call her tomorrow after summer camp(sc) 
 PRQT17 [8:44 PM]:  cuz i am pissed

I IMed daniela saying that I, ""jen"" didnt want her to tell people that we're friends. she's like ""i'm not"" then she started giving me an attitude saying something like ""my mother was right about you and your so called ""gang."" because of you making fun of abby I got slapped"" and i'm like ""HELL YEA!!"" lol that must have gotten her pissed.remember i was pretending to be jen so bare with me when i say ME or I or MINE or whatever. So she started telling me all this crap about standing up for me in 3rd grade because Chardai said my diary was stupid and then she said it wasnt!!LOL i'm like thats standing up for some1??!! lol u were the only 1 she said it to so ofcourse no1 else could have stood up for me lol. then she started saying that she's friends with abby and stuff and that he likes her as a friend now. i'm like please bitch he slapped u twice and he said u were an ugly fucked up hoe! she didnt say anything so i pretending to be jennifer said that me,ivana,steph,and destiny were his friends since we talk to  him at his games and everything and she sais he goes over vicky's house all the time w/ louie and sammy. she said that they spell it lewy. LMAO i saw vicky spell it louie. then she said that its bi-otch not biotch lol. I, ivana, remember me calling her a whore and a slut and she's like its ""hore"" and ""slute"" DAMN I WAS CRACKING UP!!!!!!!!!!!! its soo funny. so finally i felt like being myself and saying ""get a fucking dictionary with your unibrow self"" but that was soo not jen so i was like ""fuck u..oops now ur gonna cry again my bad"" lol because when steph said fuck u in her face she started crying lol. then she's like me ha ...lol then BLOCKAGE(i blocked her)"

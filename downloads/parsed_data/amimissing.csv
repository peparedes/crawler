"event","<small>Mmk, I did the best job of commenting that I could.  It wasn't very extensive.  As I'm sure you can all attest to, words haven't been flowing out of me very easily of late.

I kicked around what all I was going to say in my final entry a little while.  I wish I was eloquent.  I wish I could find clever ways of saying common things.  I wish a lot of things.  Most of them stay wishes.

So I'm going to leave it at this.  If you're on my friends list, there is a reason for it.  There was some level of connection with myself and you, whether it was a personal friendship, or a shared interest in Dashboard Confessional, or a love for quality movies.  I always enjoyed reading your entries.  It allowed me to feel like I was part of something bigger than just Tulsa, Oklahoma;  that little pieces of me were all over the country.

Any of you that may want to keep in contact with me through e-mail, I would love to hear from you.  I've found that my email writing capacity seems to be much better than my journal writing.  I would love to hear from any of you guys, to hear how things are going, updates on your lives, invitations to weddings (Miranda, and I'm sure Karen's is not going to be far behind.)  Obviously, you're under no obligation to add on to what is probably an already hectic schedule/life.  No hurt feelings or anything, so no worries.  If you'd like to, though, you can contact me at Daytripr04@aol.com, or Briliantdance@yahoo.com.  I love you guys like I love my own family.  I wish only the best for all of you."

"event","<small>So I've been just delaying the inevitable.  I think it's time to jump the LJ ship.  Part of me hates to, because I've met so many (OK, a couple) wonderful people through this thing.  And it's kind of the only way I can keep up with others.  I'm in one of those evaluation modes in my life.  A lot of things are changing, some for the good, some not so much, but change none the less.  I feel like I'm uselessly taking up space on most of your friends lists.  I haven't really updated in ever, and my commenting is basically just as bad.

I do want to make one more round of comments.  I'll try and do that tomorrow.  And I'm sure I'll do the obligatory ""goodbye"" post, complete with shout-outs.  Maybe not, I duno.

Later fuckfaces.

<b><i>I miss you, miss you so bad
I don't forget you, oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same

I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't

I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same

I had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
And I can't take it
It wasn't fake
It happened, you passed by

Now you're gone
There you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now your gone
There you go
Somewhere you're not coming back

The day you slipped away
Was the day i found it won't be the same
The say you slipped away
Was the day that i found it won't be the same
I miss you"

"event","<small>Mission Control to Joey, do you read us Joey?  I think we have a problem...

Yea, so hi.  Once again, I've been avoiding this thing like the plague.  It's quite funny, actually, because in all the time I've been not checking or updating, some of the entries I see are the same thing.  Drama this, this one pissed off at the other, so and so not speaking to such and such.

I was actually expecting to find that more people had removed me from their friends' list, due to my sheer lack of updating.  Only 1 person took me off, and I'm not entirely sure what her motivation was behind it, but hey, it's all good.

So...newness with me.  So far this year, I've been on 2 trips to Dallas with work related stuff.  First time I was there for a week, meeting with clients, the second time was a weekend, exhibiting.  Good times.  Dallas actually isn't all that bad.  I went Deep Ellum a couple years ago, which is like the arts' district there.  Unfortunately, going on business doesn't allow for much social time.  But the trips were ok, I guess.  We made some contacts, we'll see if we can pick up some new business off of it.

I bought the Underworld DVD, and have watched it at least a dozen times, lol.  Kate Beckinsale in black leather, how nice lol.

I guess thats all for now.  Go Panthers!  Happy Super Bowl everyone.  Have fun, eat lots.  Ciao"

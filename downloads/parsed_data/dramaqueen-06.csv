I miss the look of surrender in your eyes
The way your soft brown hair would fall
I miss the power of your kiss when we made love
Oh, but baby most of all

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
And let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss the colors that you brought into my life
Your golden smile, those blue-green eyes
I miss your gentle voice in lonely times like now
Saying it'll be alright

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
And let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss those times
I miss those nights
I even miss our silly fights
The making up
The morning talks
And those late afternoon walks

I miss my friend
The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say to make me laugh again
let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss my friend

I miss my friend

Mmmmmmmm

I miss my friend"

I dont really know where to begin....I guess Ill start with one of my best friends will not talk to me..I dont know what I did or what I said but she will not talk to me and she just walks away when I show up at the same place...so I try not to let it bother me but it does, if she is mad, upset or whatever she is at me, then ok I guess. I just miss her... On a lighter note prom is around the corner and Ill be going with Rian, for the most of what I can tell he is a kool kid. I feel like we all are going to have a blast but I really dont know what all the comotion is that goes along with prom just becuase it doesnt feel like it is going to be all like how they show it in the movies. I have been working my tail feathers off at work and getting no tip but o well..Im sad Sammy put her two weeks in on friday and she said that she really wants to find a job that is more professional. she says that she really doesnt care if she ever speaks to any of the people at work agian except for me, she might come and hangout this week if she doesnt have to work at finishline. YAY! She is so cute and the sweetest girl. Im gonna miss having her there to pick on and to have someone to keep me inline!. Driver's Ed is fun only because my girl Katie is in it with me!That poor poor girl has to drive with me I feel bad for her...Speaking of driving I have drove everywhere all this weekend. So Watch out everyone! I spent the night at Mindy's on friday night and dyed her hair red...I know what yall are thinking and yea it turned orange...poor girl but she is going to get it fixed. we had fun doing it anyways... Last night was a blast Hanging out with Andy we were just having SO much fun at his Dad's birthday party. I got to meet some of his family and family friends which was cool because they all loved me.lol They kept asking if Andy and I were going out and we kept having to tell all the drunk ones no. The lady I sat next to kept pounding one drink after another down and she ws my favorite, because of some of the things she would say. I met Andy's cousin who was cool, he goes to putnam and is dating someone that graduated from Gladstone last year. I was also the last out of 30 people to get my food but Andy was sweet and waited till I got my plate. Thanks Andy I had a blast last night and you did great driving with your parents freaking out lol!!
Well, that is enough for now ill write more later!

Happy Easter and happy birthday to Jess!!
I went to work at seven this morning! Yea but I got a nice big tip!! Everyone was great and in such good moods!! :) I met our new hostess and she is alright. I dont think she will last long bc she doesnt really know what she is doing and she doesnt like the job at all. Whatever as long as I get to work with Sammy, Tasha, Julie ans Stacy im good. They are the best people in the world!
When I got off I went and had a great lunch at Corina's G-ma's house. We hid plastic eegs with quaters for them in the yard and then us adults (im an adult lol) went on a scavenger hunt for plastic eggs filled with fives, tens, and twentys!! Cool huh? I got forty dollars out of it!

Yesterday (Sat) I went to work not much fun there we just cleaned our little asses off Sammy and I to get ready for Easter. Then after I went over to mindy's new apartment to check it out and help unpack. James was there and I have a history with James. so... We just hungout and flirted with eachother.(I know what you are thinking but, he has a g/f!) It was a Blast we found Mindy's bathingsuits and put one on him! lol
we stuffed him and everything! I have pictures! Oman good times!

Im having some problem with certian things at home and in the relationship area. I feel like I dont know what I want anymore.... I feel like I let myself get stepped all over by guys that I ""think"" I like. I just dont know anymore.... I have to think..So....
Talk Later!

"event","Well so Kendra, Amber, Alica, Mommy and I went to the concert last night and we had a BLAST. We were breathing the same air as him....and 5 thousand other people but still!! WE got T-shirts that us girls are going to wear on MONDAY! He was so hott and sounded great! We tried winning T-shirts from 99.5 The Wolf but they were being retarded and only giving them to older girls. Kendra even had Amber on her shoulders! Those JERKS!! Well the guy I like is back from California, but some reason it isnt the same, maybe im just being paranoid. IDK I was all Happy about this one but now I'm having a feeling it might just turn out like all my other relationships. grr.. I thought he was different! Damn.... So I'm still going to prom with him but just as friends for right now. I talk to Jess online Wednesday and I balled like a baby when we talked. It was the first time we have talked like best friends in a LONG time. I asked if I would ever lose him and he told me that we would never lose what we had and we may never get back what we had but all we can do is try our best and hold on tight. Then he joked around about only losing me if he didnt have his map. lol I love him so much, I dont know what I would do with out him or Kendra baby. (and Andy because he is my laugh for the day!) Well, now that I am writing yall a novel I will write more later.

Then we watched The Notebook at Kendra's house and Balled our eyes out! (I recommend it to EVERYONE!!) On Monday we made french toast and went to my house to babysit Jess and my Bro! It was CRAZY!! They kept beating Kendra and I with plastic guns and knives. When my parents got home we all went to Applebee's for a great dinner and Krispy Kremes after! Then when we got home Kendra Jess and I had a stuffed animal/pillow fight in my room and trashed it!
Denae seemed to be pissed at Jess for hanging out with us for like the first time in the last three months. He did his little running back to her to make her happy. He changes so much when he gets girlfriends it pisses me off but hey what does he care, we arent even that close any more! Cant wait for the guys and Erikin Slurpin to get back from Cali!!!

Well I asked him to prom and he said yes! He is such a great guy and he is always surprising me with something like, stopping by randomly wherever I am at or just doing something cute for me. :) I'm still a kid in a candy store around him. Right now he is in California having a BLAST with the guys from Baseball.
He stopped by work on Thursday night before he left to eat and to say goodbye to me!! (It made my day the BEST ever!) I have been hanging out with Kendra Baby and Erkin Slurpin alot lately, most of the time just hanging out around the house. When I am not just hanging out at the house I am travling with the JV Baseball team doing scorekeeping. Oman, the guys are SO hilarious and they are all really nice! Driver's Ed starts on the 30th and from there my Wednesdays and Tuesdays will be devoted to that. It should be fun because Katie says that she will most likely be taking it with me!! YAY!! I missed that girl Im happy that she is feeling somewhat better and came to school on Friday! We are both SO excited for prom we can not stopp talking about it! LOL Girls!
Well Today was Tina's Bridal Shower at my house and We had such a BLAST. I love her so much and miss her! (she lives in Dallas w/ her fiance) She is one of the people I look up to because she is gorgeous and is such a great person. She is one of the very few people that found their Prince Charming. Im really happy for her! We are going to Vegas Soon!! Oman Im so OVERLY EXCITED!! lol
Well I will Write more later!

My new house is great and HUGE. All the guys want to move in and Kendra already basically lives here now 24/7. (what is new?)
I have a crush on someone that is not in the group, which is kind of nice for a change (less drama). Im kinda of still working out how I feel about this guy because I have just kind of got to know him over the last few days. We talk ALOT and, we actually have alot in common. Wierd how that works huh? lol
Went to the Seaside varsity boys basketball game and we won of course! It was a BLAST taking the rooter bus down and watching the guys kick ass!! God Job Guys! I couldnt make it up to La Grande but I think I heard we lost. OOPS, nice try guys you had a great season!!!
Spirit Week was ok I wish it was five days like usual, but it was still a blast. Class of 06 did great this year!! I was so proud of them!!! I cant wait next year will be our senior year YAY!!

Wed- 6-9
Thurs- 6-9
Sat- 8-2

"event","I have a really wierd story to tell you.
So yesterday I went with my mom and my aunt to this antique flea market, held at the National Guard Armory. While I was off looking I noticed this guy following me, he kept stopping whenever I would stop and look, Well at one of the tables he tapped me on my shoulder and made a conversation with me. He seemed kind of ""SPECIAL"" and so I didnt want to be rude. Then he asked me where I went to school and I was like ""UUHH oregon city!"" becuase he started to act really kreepy. So I said bye, walked away and met up with my mom and aunt. I didnt think anything of this guy until I was getting ready to leave, when he cut me off from my mom (mom kept walking not noticing that I stopped) and was getting forcful and asked me freaky questions about my ""private parts"". So I told him he had no right to talk to me about this and that he needed to leave me alone, by this time my mom noticed that I stopped and turned to look at me. I was getting ready to tell this FREAK off when he just dead bolted for the door. My mom and aunt wanted to kill this guy, and thought that it was time to go. When we reached the car, my aunt started to freak out syaing ""O MY GOD THAT FREAK IS RIGHT THERE!!"" he was parked right next to us and was sitting there waving at me and blowing kisses. We got in the car and drove off all freaked out. then we noticed after a couple miles that THIS FREAK WAS FOLLOWING US!!! so my aunt drove like a mad woman and lost him at a light. It was the wierdest thing that has EVER happened to me. I really wanted to knee the guy is the nuts!!!"

Today I had fun at the aquirium, I got to see the Otters and the Sharks!!!! I had a blast and got some pictures on my phone. I also had a nice long walk on the beach with Shelby we talked about EVERYTHING!! We have not talked like that in a long time it was nice seeing her this weekend. Well the weather here is great, sunny and not windy!

My classes for second semester are ok, I dont have any that are fun. I expect to get good grades this semester!! I wish that not everyone in our group had early release because then no one is there for lunch!

** just a memory**
This is why Jess is my best friend in the whole world!!
A couple of days ago I was having a bad night and I was on the with Jess and I started to cry. He can ALWAYS tell when I am upset. While we sat there in dead silence on the phone (while I cried) he sarted to sing to me!! I was so sweet and what also got me was that is was MY song. You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy, when skies are gray, you'll never know dear how much I love you, Please don't take my sunshine away! He made my night so much better! I think that only he is the only one who knows how to make me smile when I feel down! Thanks you so much Jess I love you with all my heart!!

LOL SO WE DECIDED THAT THEY WERE GONNA PAY! SO STARTED THIS KIND OF WAR THING BETWEEN US AND THE GUYS! BUT FRIDAY NIGHT JESS GOT THE WORST ONE OF ALL SO FAR!! WE FUCKED HIS TRUCK OVER AT HIS WORK! LOL THANKS DENAE!! BUT IT IS ALL IN FUN AND GAMES, THEY KNOW WE LOVE THEM!ENOUGH BOUT THAT ON TO BIGGER A BETTER THINGS. LIFE HAS BEEN GOOD SO FAR EVERYTHING IS LOOKIN UP. WORK HAS BEEN REALLY SLOW COMING OFF OF THE HOLIDAYS. I GOT MY HEALTH WEDDING PROJECT DONE AND IT LOOKS GOOD, IF I SAY SO MYSELF. LOL IM JUST NERVOUS TO SEE WHAT THE GRADE IS.I KNOW THIS MIGHT SOUND DUMB BUT I THINK I MIGHT BE HEAD OVER HEELS FOR THIS GUY!! I DONT KNOW IT JUST FEELS SO RIGHT, I DONT KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT. UMM THIS WEEKEND FLEW BY SO FREAKIN FAST!!

**** I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS THAT I ALMOST CRIED WHEN I HEARD!! MY SISTER CALLED ME WEDNESDAY AND TOLD ME IN EXACT WORDS; ""SISSY WHITNEY I MISS YOU AND MY BIRTHDAY I WANT TO COME SEE YOU!"" OMG HER BIRTHDAY WISH WAS TO COME DON AND SEE HER BIG SISTER!! HOW CUTE AND I HAVE PLANNED THE WHOLE WEEKEND OUT!! MY BABY IS COMING TO SEE ME, THAT WAS MY ONE AND ONLY HUGE X`MAS WISH AND I AM GETTING IT! BUT BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!!IM SO EXCITED!

HERE ARE SOME POEMS I FOUND THAT EXPRESS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS GUY!!:

**IF I WERE AN...**
If I were an angel I'd give you my wings...
Just so you could fly everywhere looking for the girl who'd make your heart sing. 
If I were a princess I'd give you my crown... 
Just so you could have a kingdom to search for the one who'd keep you from being down. 
If I were the sandman I'd make all your dreams come true... 
Just so the girl of your dreams could be with you. 
If I were a magician I'd give you my wand... 
Just so she could magically appear to love and keep you strong. 
If I were a fairy I'd give you my magic dust... 
Just so you could sprinkle it and find the one worthy of your trust. 
If I were a shooting star I'd make all your wishes come true... 
But I'm not... I'm just a girl in love with you.

**SHOULD I?**
Should i look into your eyes, or should i turn away
should i go home now, or should i decide to stay
if i choose to stay, will you promise not to break my heart?
you know if u break your promise, it will tear me apart
i have to admit, im kind of confused
i dont want to get hurt, i dont want to get used
thats happened to me before you know, and it really hurt
i dont wanna be your girl, if your gonna treat me like dirt
im not a doormat, i dont have ""welcome"" on my head
do you understand anything that i just said?
i want to know now, are you going to hurt me
i'll be your superwoman, if you dont desert me
you understand my theory now, so the decisions up to you
will you be a player? or will you stay true?
dont say anything, just to get ur way
think about it hard, im not a game to play
make up your mind, i really need to know
should i stay with you, or should i decide to go?

WELL ILL WRITE MORE LATER
LOVE YALL

**KATIE AND ANDY**

**THE TRUTH**
WELL HERE IT IS THE FLAT OUT TRUTH NO EXCEPTIONS BECAUSE THIS IS MY JOURNAL. IF YOU DONT LIKE IT IM SORRY THIS IS MY LIFE AND HOW I FEEL. I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT IT AND IM NOT GOIN TO HOLD IT IN TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY ANYMORE OR SUGAR COAT IT!!! I LIKE JON MORE THAN ANYTHING, YES I CANT STAND THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR US BUT THAT DOESNT CHANGE THE WAY I FEEL. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I MIGHT BE HURT, I STILL WILL ALWAYS LIKE HIM. I HAVE TRIED SO MANY TIMES TO GET OVER HIM AND IT JUST DOESNT WORK. SO IM NOT GOIN TO LIE TO MY FRIENDS OR MYSELF ANYMORE THINKIN THAT I AM OVER HIM. I LIKE THE WAY WE FEEL WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER AND HOW HE TREATS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER. YES I KNOW YOU ARE PROBABLY THINKING THAT HE HASNT ALWAYS TREATED ME THE BEST, BUT HE DOESNT TREAT ME LIKE THAT WHEN IT IS JUST US. SO THAT IS HOW I FEEL AND I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT OUT. IM SORRY IF I HURT ANYONES FEELINGS BY WRITING THIS, I HAD NO INTENTIONS ON HURTING ANYONE JUST TELLING THE TRUTH, NO LIES, NO SUGAR COATING, JUST THE STRIAGHT TRUTH.

"event","*Im excited for Christmas, it has been a great year and I love to see everyone put up their lights! OMG Santa come for us tonight because I leave for my father's side of the family. Well I hope that everyone has a great Christmas and gets some things they hoped for.

**Well Yesterday was a blast, I had my friends come over for a gift exchange and snacks. Then my Mom was nice to let me leave with them and go hangout at Jay's house. We ended up spending the night at Katie's house, Jay, Katie, Jon and I. We watched Final Destination 2 and Elf! We had a blast and Emma Kaite's puppy is SO adorable.

***I saw Kelley today and I miss that guy he is always so sweet when we get to talking. I hope that he gets everything out of life that he hopes for.

I dont like drama and I hope that I dont cause too much. I just want to follow my heart and lately I dont know where that is leading to it seems like a broken compass where it spins round and round and stops every once and awhile. So either I need a new heart or I just need to stop trying to follow it. lol! I wrote this in the last couple of weeks and thought I should post it. Tell me what you think, Some of the lines might not rhyme or sound the best but I tried! It is just what I was feeling, so sue me!

Confused?

Confused how you feel about me
Well you souldn't be
Either you like me or you don't
You either will or you won't

I dont want to play these games
But I like these flames
These flames I feel between you and me
When you cuddle with me

Confused how you feel about me
Well you souldn't be
Either you like me or you don't
You either will or you won't

You can't say you've tried
Because of all these tears I've cried
Why wont you just let go
Why can't you just say No

Confused how you feel about me
Well you souldn't be
Either you like me or you don't
You either will or you won't

You know where I stand and you know where I'll be
So when your ready just come and find me
I can't make any promises that I'm willing to keep
But I can say that I've tried and that means the most to me.
**KID**

HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS!!TALK TO YALL SOON!!

We went out and drove around, Im going to miss him so much because my babe is leaving for college in Florida after Christmas! I thought Corvalis was a ways away for a relationship, but Florida! There is no way we would have lasted. Sad but true and we both know that! We still love eachother and will be together when he comes to see me. 

***Ill miss you hunny with all my heart, I hope that you have a great time! See you Soon! You mean the world to me and nothing will ever change that even if we fight like mad dogs! lol

But on another note I went with my Dad today and volunteered at the hospital. It was fun everyone kept tellin me that I am a beautiful girl that has a great life ahead of me. How nice is that! Well voluteering always getss me in the Christmas spirit! Speakin of Christmas I have to work on Sat for 3 til 7 if anyone wants to stop and say hi! My Friends are stoppin by tomarrow to do a gift exchange that should be alot of FUN!! I have such great friends they love me and I love them just as much!

YAY! Me and ""MY FRIEND"" are ok and that make my world a whole lot better! Now I can sleep at night knowing that one of my closest friends doesnt hate me!
This is turning out to be the best break so far! I hope everyone else is havin a blast!
There is only one peson that can make my Christmas complete and that would be MY SISTER. Oh man do I miss her, she is my little angel! I would give the world to have her home with me!
Talk more later!

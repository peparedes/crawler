"event","Ever since I got back from Georgia there is something wrong with me.  Today I went out for lunch with Andy at the Beijeing Kitchen and I couldn't eat anything.  The seasame chiken was yummy but for whatever reason I didn't feel like eating.  I just felt well, blah.  I'm tired even though I sleep forever (until 12:30 today) and even though I've only eaten two cookies, a few pieces of chicken, and a piece of cheese bread today I'm not hungry.  I hate when I feel like this.  

I go back to school tomorrow for my lovely summer classes, I think a part of me is actually looking forward to it.  The sooner I get done with summer classes fall classes start; the sooner fall classes start the closer I am to actually getting to the interesting higher level classes that I want to take.  I want this next year of school to be over so I can go to State and actually get away from my sister.  But I know that leaving Grand Rapids is going to be so hard cause it means leaving Andy too.  I was gone for a week and missed him so much I felt like part of me was missing, I don't know what being away from him all the time is going to be like.  

Being away from Andy made me realize how much I actually do love him.  He's going to Indiana for two Phish concerts and is going to be gone Wednesday through part of Friday.  I know it's only like, two and a half days but damn I don't know what I'm going to do while he's gone.  One night, while I was still in Savannah, I was talking to him on the phone and he said, ""You're never going to leave me for a week again."" It was so sweet for me to hear that he missed me that much that he didn't want to be away from me for that long again.  I don't know what I'm going to do while he's gone on his family vacation.  

On a totally unrelated note:  Sissy and her boyfriend got into a ginormous fight while in GA because her boy-toy has a tendencey to talk about how great he thinks he is.  He tends to brag about himself in his Xanga quite a bit.  When I got back and caught up on my Xanga's I saw that his latest post was about how good he looks with his new hair cut.  I don't think he understood what she was so upset about.  

That was random.  I think I'm done now."

"event","Tonight I realized how lucky I am to have such wonderful family.  My family loves me and the more I think about it, I love everyone of them.  My aunts and uncles, my cousins, my cousins kids, my cousins significant others,  I love every single one of them.  Since I started dating Andy I've also thought about how he would fit into my family.  Tonight I realized that he already has a spot saved for him.  My family made a spot for Andy when they heard I was spending Easter with him, cause they knew that his family had made a place for me.  Tonight Jeff kept asking me about him, and why he wasn't there, the sweet part was that he couldn't be there because he was working for me so I could be there.  I want him to be able to meet everyone so badly becuase I think it would help him to know me even better.  And I think he would feel at home with them and he would realize that his family loves him too, even if he doesn't believe it."

"event","So it's been a long time since I've written here.  Maybe that's because I don't care because no one reads this.  Yeah, that could very well be it.  So yeah.  I only have one more night class, hoorah!!!!  And I figured out that even with the class that I dropped I can still finish my requirements in the next two semesters!!! Quadruple WOOT!!!  

I'm freaked out about next Thursday, really, really freaked out."

You don't scare me, well, yeah you kind of do but not as much as you would like to think.  HA!"

"event","Okay well seeing as how no one knows I have this I can write whatever I want.  Sometimes I think it would be better if I broke up with Andy.  We've only been together a month so it wouldn't be that traumatic and it would save a lot of heartache in the end.  Sometimes I think that we just don't understand each other.  I feel like I'm just some pesky little girl to him and that he doesn't really want to be with me.  I really do want to be with him though.  Like I said I don't think that we understand each other.  At least I know that I don't understand him.  I don't know why he does what he does or says what he says, I really wish that I did though.  The other day I said that I don't know why I do the things that I do.  David says that everyone knows why the do what the do.  Now I'm trying to figure it out, I'm trying to figure out why I do what I do, and then I'm going to try to figure out how to stop doing it.  I need to change.  I don't like who I am but I should.  The only thing is, can I change myself it sounds really hard."

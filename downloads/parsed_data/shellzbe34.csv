three important rules for breaking up 
don't put off breaking up when you know you want to 
prolonging the situation only makes it worse 
tell him honestly simply kindly but firmly 
don't make a big production 
don't make up an elaborate story 
this will help you avoid a big tear-jerking scene 
if you want to date other people, say so 
be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected 
even if you've gone together for only a short time 
and haven't been too serious 
there's still a feeling of rejection when somebody says 
she prefers the company of others to your exclusive company 
but if you're honest and direct 
and avoid making a flowery emotional speech 
when you break the news 
the boy will respect you for your frankness 
and honestly, he'll appreciate the kind straight-forward manner 
in which you told him your decision 
unless he's a real jerk or a cry-baby you'll remain friends 
i'm head of the class 
i'm popular
i'm a quarterback
i'm popular 
my mom says i'm a catch 
i'm popular
i'm never last picked 
i've got a cheerleading chick 
being attractive is the most important thing there is 
if you want to catch the biggest fish in your pond 
you have to be as attractive as possible 
make sure to keep your hair spotlessly clean 
wash it at least every two weeks 
once every two weeks 
and if you see johnny football hero in the hall 
tell him he played a great game 
(tell him you liked his article in the newspaper) 
i'm the party star 
i'm popular
i've got my own car 
i'm popular
i'll never get caught 
i'm popular
i make football bets 
i'm the teacher's pet
i propose we support a one-month limit on going steady 
i think it would keep people more able to deal with weird situations 
get to know more people 
i think if you're ready to go out with johnny 
now's the time to tell him about your one-month limit 
he won't mind 
he'll appreciate your fresh look on dating 
and once you've dated someone else 
you can date him again 
i'm sure he'll like it, everyone will appreciate it 
you're so novel, what a good idea 
you can keep your time to yourself, you don't need date insurance 
you can go out with whoever you want to 
every boy, every boy in the whole world could be yours 
if you'll just listen to my plan 
the teenage guide (to popularity) 
i'm head of the class 
i'm popular
i'm a quarterback 
i'm popular
my mom says i'm a catch 
i'm popular
i'm never last picked

"event","From Avril's blog entry entitled ""Paquita"":

 ""Well Irina..... A.K.A The pointed feet Nazi

Well she is in Russia right now. Yipee so her daughter, Daria, the one that is inthe Sarasota Ballet, and her son in law who is married to Daria, are teaching and they are AWESOME, I love them and I want them to stay forever.

I am doing the a variation for recitial if I decide to be in it.
I am doing one from Paquita. UMM Sophie you know which one I am talking about. Dun dun dun dun dun dun.....dun.....dun. dun dun. It isn't the Cupid one but its ummm CRAP what is it calllllled...... Um Shelly did it in 2003. Yea I am doing that one. I chose it, because I wanna get better at jumping ON my toes.

Anyways thats alllll for now.""

Sophie's comment: ""Doesn't it go dun dun dun dun DUN.... dun dun dun dun dunnen DUN.

That's an awesome variation for you! Is is the same one that Juliette did in Paquita, the Cupid one? Or was that Shelley? Remember with the tiny little grand jetes in the beginning that Juliette could never do? Or is it Shelley's when she was supposed to be washing the tables all the time, and she couldn't.

Regardless, DO IT. Don't not be in the recital, however crappy people are acting. You only get to do a few shows a year as it is.""


:(  i feel sad."

"event","Romeo and Juliet - The worst dance ever.

My grandma laughed about how loud it was when we clattered up and down those horrible stairs. What a stupid platform! We didnt need a platform. I'm embarassed just thinking about it.

TangA - Yuck...

I can barely even remember doing the beginning.  I was so incredibly nervous for some reason.  It was generally pretty crappy. Pretty mysterious how no one seemed to see me fall on my turns...I bet they are lying and they all saw but don't want to try and tell me that it wasn't noticeable.  

IndianA jazz - kick ass!

Oh yeah Alaina - sorry I told you that the kick part was next when you were supposed to be up front. I kind of forgot. :( You still got there in time though.

Anyway.

What my last entry was pretty much about was that John and I were at his house on Saturday. I came over at like 6. At around 11 his friends called him and I guess asked if he wanted to go over to their house b/c they were having a party...and he said yes! I couldn't believe he'd rather be over there than with me. I wouldn't choose anyone over him. It really hurt my feelings, and he knew it. So he was like ""I'm really sorry Shelley.."" But he obviously wasn't that sorry. Because otherwise he just wouldnt have gone. So thus, the realizations.

And I decided not to call him that night, and I didn't ask him to call me or anything.  He called at 4 in the morning when I guess he got home.  I was really glad that he at least thought to.

And then I didn't call him today when I got up and went to dance or anything. And he called me before he went to work. So that made me happy too. I didn't really think he would. Or at least I didn't want to think he would, so I wouldn't be too dissapointed when he didn't.

It sucks being the obsessive girlfriend. Though there are some perks...:)"

"event","Oh man. Today was horrible! After dance, my grandma and her brother along with his wife and son came over for a visit.  

Yeah.

It was really uncomfortable, especially since her brother couldn't remember my name. So I took a twenty minute shower, then a nice bath. Then I went in my room and read for a little while before going back downstairs to hell. 

My mom made me show dance tapes. Which they found boring, because a few seconds into they would start talking amongst themselves. Then more dance tapes my mom said. And I really didnt want to since I knew they didnt care. But no. I had to. So then they got to see me do Arabian. That's nice.

Then thankfully John showed up. Then dinner. Then John and I were allowed to go in the computer room while they sat and talked around the table. That's the first time that's ever happened. I usually have to stay and zone out in discomfort. So that was great. 

The departure was extremely uncomfortable, but oh well. They're gone! 

And now I'm doing more research on hormones in cows. It's kind of gross. I'm focusing on rBGH, which they inject in cows so they produce more milk.  I think I'm going to try and buy milk that doesn't have rBGH in it, and I suggest you all do the same. They really should ban it.

My speech about it is on Thursday. That's going to really suck, I'm not anywhere near ready, nor do I think I will be by that time. So that should be interesting.  

Alaina, go on with your bad self and dye your hair blueish black this week. That would be so gorgeous. DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! :)

And Katie, you go on with your bad self and...rock out! HELLS YEAH!"

"event","So i went to my actual english class yesterday.  i was really nervous to tell the teacher my little error and thought he was going to think i was a tard already and say it was too late.  although he did seem pretty surprised that i was in the wrong class for such a long time, he didnt really pass too much judgement. so thats good. and im not really behind. and everythings ok. whew. 

I'm so excited about Ivan.  Maybe they'll just cancel school altogether?? I'll suggest it to Jeb.

I went to 369 today and got some good old fashioned cashew chicken. man was that good...but then for dinner my mom made chicken and rice. so that was a little gross.  i feel slightly sick.

My toenail is looking pretty gross. Katie knows...It's so embarassing! What shall I do?? Die. That's probably the most reasonable option.

I'm so bored. 

I invited Alaina over to teach her the silly indian jazz dance but she totally rejected me. she was like ""my ass shelley, you're ugly. and i dont want to come over to your ugly house."" it was mean. and no i didnt make that up. actually...she claimed to have ""work."" and we all know what alaina does for a living...i can't legally mention it on this website, but if anyone wants to know i'll definitely whisper it in your ear."

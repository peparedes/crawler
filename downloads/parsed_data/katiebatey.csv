i thought that right now we are supposed to be thanking God for what we have and our wonderful friends and families- not knowing if they'll still be here tomorrow.  so how does screaming at eachother about stuff that really does not matter factor in?

"event","oh God I miss him.  i can't believe this.  i've been trying so hard to ignore it and pretend i'm over it and that it doesn't matter... but i am going crazy without him.  i have never missed someone like this.  it's been over a month.  almost a month and a half.  i need to be over him.  i certainly need to not be in love with him anymore.  this is awful.

this will all sound weird and convoluted, but just bear with me here, because i really can't give you the whole picture.  but Matt told me he misses me (the ex).  and thank the Lord i am not naive enough to fall for his shit, because i know how he works, and i'm not just one of his dumb little girls he can screw with.  but you know he pulled the whole ""it would be different this time""  and all that crap.  anyway, once i finally got to the heart of the matter that he wants me to sleep with him (jee that took all of 3.7 seconds...), i actually thought about it.  i mean, we all know i'd never <i>do</i> it... but the thought crossed my mind for a moment.  i tried to picture what it would be like.  and i realized that i would cry.  i would cry because the last time i had sex it was with Joel and it was absolutely amazing and i cried then too, because it was the most wonderful emotional and spiritual experience of my life.  it would kill me to be with someone else because i don't know if i will ever feel that way again- and it will hurt so so much when i don't feel that kind of emotion.  and the last person i was with was Joel... and at this point that is absolutely all that i have left to hold on to.  and i can't let that <i>go</i>.  i don't want to be with anyone else.  i don't want to lose that last bit of him.  

i feel so desperate for him, and Jesus, Marie, you're right, this song just says it fucking all.  i have never felt like i NEEDED someone so badly.  like i can't <i>breathe</i> knowing he doesn't care if we ever speak again.  like i have nothing to wake up for in the morning because i may never hear his voice again or kiss his lips or hear his laughter or see that amazing smile.  

and i don't know what to DO!  i feel completely ALONE and afraid and helpless.  i have no control and it kills me.  i can't make him love me.  i can't do anything to make him want to say hello to me or care how i'm doing.

and i HATE him for that... but God, i love him so much. 

why does it have to hurt so bad?  if i can never have him then why do i have to go through all this pain.  what will i get in return?

love me"

... not to talk to you.  i forget that every time i talk to you i say ""i am not going to talk to him anymore.""  because now that we're past all the shit that we had to get past and i'm doing great and you're doing great and everything is just great, you still manage to treat me like i don't exist.  and obviously i have a brain and i see that you don't want to talk to me, but i keep forgetting that.  i say ""hi""  and then i think ""ugh!!  why did i bother??""  

i have no idea why we didn't get through this and stay friends.  at least i can say i gave a shit and i tried.  but it's weird to me that you became so distant when we seemed to be really good friends before.  i really get a kick out of the way guys are so terrific until they get what they want- then they have no need to pretend they care.  

the thing is, i don't even care anymore.  i tried to stay friends and i tried to care about what was going on in your life and say hello now and then, and i've worn myself out.  there are too many great people in my life that actually give a shit about me to worry about the one person who couldn't care less.

so, unless you email me back explaining that you're NOT purposely treating me like shit and you really are just so busy, and if only you had more time... well, then i'll walk away and pretend you never mattered to me either.  

hope everything is good,

"event","so Alex read my reply to her comment and instantly apologized.  she also wanted me to note that she's from Thailand, not Taiwan, which is apparently a whole different country (haha).  i know i will never be able to change the world- and i would never bother to try- but it feels good to know i can change one person's mind.  

lots of American flags waving now.  it's so beautiful, all that red, white and blue blowing in the breeze.  seeing them at half-mast really hits me hard.  and i keep hearing people singing the National Anthem and America the Beautiful, etc.  and it makes me cry like a child every time.  i never realized until now how much i love this wonderful country.  things are gonna change around here- but i think that after the worst is over, we will come out on top, better and stronger- and we will all be a thousand times more appreciative of what we have.  maybe it's God's way of telling us to open our eyes and stop taking everything we have for granted.  

no matt again at school today.  grr.  oh well.  i talked to this guy Chad who's also in the class, and he was pretty cool.  it's so nice getting attention.  that sounds terrible, but after everything with Joel, i SO needed attention!  hope matt's back on wednesday though.  i can understand though- he lives almost an hour and a half away- i'd skip my 8:00 too!  

last night Joel told me that it's hard not being able to talk as much now.  without any prompting on my part.  it was nice to hear that, but it made me see something very important.  we aren't not talking by <i>choice</i>- we just do not have the time.  and now i realize that if things had worked out differently with us, it would be even worse right now.  and each day that went by without talking would kill me.  and i'd end up liking Matt anyway, because i'd be so lonely.  i still miss Joel.  how can i not?  we really had the most amazing time of my life together.  there was passion and emotion and intensity, and above all that, we had FUN.  and yes, i fell in love with him.  sometimes i look back and say ""no it wasn't love"", but i absolutely fell in love with him.  he swept me off my feet in a way that i've always dreamed of.  he treated me better than i ever thought someone could.  he held me- and he kissed me like it was the last time he would ever be kissing someone- so intensely and full of emotion.  if he was here, or i was there, i will admit, i would fall right into his arms, because i still love him.  

but i am ready to move on now.

good luck to me.  =)

"event","i have another online journal, one that i keep to myself, because people that i don't want reading my journal found out the name of this one.  i write in both now.  anyway, i wrote my reaction to the attacks in my other journal...  and this was the response i got from one guy or girl from Taiwan, who is 21:

<i>i like your journal especially the last line.i pity innocent people (like the firefighters)but the other self of me has an opinion that America deserves it for what she has done to other countries for years (vietnam,japan,kosovo,africa,iraq for example).And what US administration going to do right now is quite pathetic and makes me sick.Sorry that i'm cruel and nasty.to be honest,you can cut me from your list. 

yours, 
alex</i>

i honestly feel sick and very very frightened to know that people in this world can have these views.  i did not cut Alex from my friends list.  i replied, a lengthy response, trying to make her/him understand the devastation everyone in our country is feeling.  i tried to make her/him imagine what it would feel like for her to experience her (we'll just say her, because i always think of her as a girl) last moments of life in terror, to get that last phone call from someone in a plane or building, saying goodbye forever.  i tried to have her imagine her child running home from school screaming to her ""we're all going to die!"", a fear that no innocent child should ever know.  i wanted her to think of all those children- who now have no parents to run home to.  how many LIVES were affected.  perhaps she is not so heartless, but maybe in taiwan there's not as much coverage- maybe to her it just looks like a few dead people and some ruined buildings.  i can't say.  i can't even begin to think what is going through her head to think that we deserved this.  i am angry, believe me.  and i know we will go to war, or at least i believe we will.  and more lives will be lost, here and abroad.  but you will never hear me say that afghanistan or iraq or any other country DESERVES to lose thousands of innocent people.  

i know that may end up being a result if and when the US strikes back- and i will support whatever action the government decides to take, because i am an American.  i love my country and i will do what it takes to feel safe again one day.  but i don't have the ability to look at people as objects without face's, families, and lives.  when more innocent people die, here or overseas, i will mourn for their families, not cheer as so many of them are doing now.  

i understand that these people have grown up in a society where violence and terror is all they know.  they are, in a sense, brainwashed from the time they are born, to do anything and everything their government tells them to do.  i think we can see that looking at the hijackers.  there's no way in hell 19 Americans would hop on planes with the intention of crashing them into buildings and committing suicide because someone told them to do so.  it's ridiculous.  but it's all they know.  and just because they have a warped view of life, doesn't mean they don't have families and loved ones who will be hurting after losing each other.  we see them as terrible people- and they ARE- but it truly is not their fault for being born into a society like that.  

so, while i feel we have to bring terrorism and that way of life to an end world-wide and do whatever it takes to do that, it doesn't make it feel good to kill innocent people, because ""they deserved it""."

there's this guy- he's in my history class.  and it's no big deal but he talked to me today and it felt so nice to be noticed.  he's adorable by the way- one of those guys you look at and you just KNOW he's a nice guy.  he looks so friendly.  gonna be a high school teacher.  

i realized i have major issues (several) when i heard that and instantly thought ""oh keep looking Kate, you'll have to work for the rest of your life"".  (1) is it really time to be planning the wedding? and (2) i know better than to be so shallow to think that something like that is relevant in any way.  

his name's Matt.  Matt O'Something.  haha i think it's O'Something.  he looks so friendly, you know?  friendly like Sarah's Mike looks.  just sweet and happy- you couldn't ever picture him angry.  haha watch him have like a terrible temper.  hahaha  

anyway, i know nothing about him, except that like me he has a ton of family in Canada.  oh that was another warped thought- we definitely can't have kids- we may be related.  i pictured us working on our genealogy projects together and both turning up on eachother's pedigree.  i am such a total nutcase.

well before i reveal any more psychotic thoughts to you, journal, i think i should get back to the books.

"event","i called him last night.  this morning.  3 am.  i was drunk.  and i missed him.  needed him.  still need him.  it is not the same without him.  nothing is right.  nothing is complete.  

i am always the first to say:  you can't ever ever find someone to complete you.  if you yourself are incomplete, no one else can ever make you whole.  no.  i was complete without him.  i was happy without him.  only <i>now</i> do i feel incomplete- now that he's gone.  

i love him.  i've really realized that now, since i've lost him.  there were things about him that were superficial that i liked before things got complicated.  i loved that he would be successful and if we ended up together we would always live as comfortably as i have always been accustomed to.  i loved that i would never have to work.  but really.  i would rather live in poverty and work every day until forever than live without him.  

do you know what it's like when someone makes you laugh?  REALLY makes you laugh?  he makes me laugh.  he makes me smile.  

there is no one else out there that is him.  imagine that, right?  hah  no one makes me laugh the WAY he does.  it's different.  no one gets me like he did.  remember how i used to talk about all the stuff we have in common?  i never realized how important that was... until now.  now i don't even want to talk to someone unless they love Nick at Nite as much as i do, and knows the words to every tv theme song worth knowing.  i don't want to bother with someone who doesn't know that ""Vicky"" was the name of the robot on Small Wonder, that my favorite flavor is cookies n' cream, that monster ballads is a damn good cd.  i don't want any part of someone who doesn't let me cuddle all night, laying my head on his chest.  i can't imagine ever giving my time to someone who doesn't ask ""how are YOU?"" and really care, or who doesn't baby me when i am sick or sad or cold or afraid, or nervous.  he took care of me.  why should i bother with someone who won't let me win at The Game of Life or who doesn't sit with me on his lap and sing ""Carebear countdown- 5,4,3,2,1!!""?  who needs a guy who won't do crossword puzzles with me or who won't sit at a bar and play ""Photo Hunt"" on those touch-screen video games?  he did everything right.  he danced with me when there was no music, he sang to me- and always the right song- even if he does have a terrible voice.  =)  he even knows just when to substitute in his own words to describe us.  he knows when to push and when not to- most people can't figure that out in a lifetime.  he doesn't take my shit; he isn't afraid to hurt my feelings.  he doesn't tiptoe around anything difficult.  he dives right into it- he faces problems.  he doesn't get freaked out.  

and you know what?  after being with someone so completely amazing and wonderful... i don't know if anyone else will ever compare to him.  he says to move on- but how in the world can i ever forget how perfect he is?  i'm not sure there would be any other way for me to not compare everyone to him.  

i miss him.  i miss him and i want him to love me.  i want him to sit and think of how wonderful i am and think how he could never imagine anyone as perfect as i am.  

and my GOD has anyone ever listened to that Chicago song ""Look Away""?  because it's just SAD.

i miss talking to someone about stupid stuff like Nick at Nite and tv theme songs and moving away to beautiful far away places.  i know it's not like he could be here or i could be there.  we wouldn't be together anyway.  but i miss being able to imagine he's here.  i would snuggle up in bed, and just pretend he was there with me, me laying on his chest, listening to his heart beat.  and now i can't, because he doesn't WANT to be here.  it's different now.

sometimes i think about going to visit mike, and sneaking up to joel's room late at night once everyone is asleep, and falling into his arms.  and we would both know it was so right.  but i know it won't happen.  i know that even if i did- even if i tried- he would tell me to go.  tell me it wasn't right- we aren't right.

so, what now?  i'm waiting for him to say more.  but maybe he won't.  i have no idea what the deal is.  

maybe he met someone... i don't know.  i'm actually doing so well- i think i would be ok with it.  i mean, he's right about us both moving on.  we should.  it is the right thing definitely.  what else is there to do?  yes i still love him, and i think he will always be one of those people i'll regret losing.  but it's life.  and there will be others.  and one day there will be someone.  the one.  and all those regrets will wash away."

I MATTERED TO SOMEONE.  i spent 4 hours with three beautiful little boys.  i got to see a baby smile and then feel him throw his tiny arms around my neck for big tight bear hugs.  i got to hear his sweet little angel laugh.  i got to watch a five-year-old write his full name for the first time, and see how proud he was, and how good it made him feel when i was proud.  i got to watch the wheels spinning in the mind of a three-year old who always has a hint of devil in his eye, and hear him tell me he loves me.  and when i came to the door this morning, they all screamed excitedly, ""KATE'S HERE!!!"", even Andrew in his baby-babble.  

3.  PEOPLE WERE THERE FOR ME.  I worked out with my mom and we talked for all three-and-a-half miles of our walk, and she listened and consoled and reminded me that i am loved.  Allison and Jim came over and listened to me whine about my stress and disappointment.  Leslie called and did the same thing.

4.  SOMEONE UNDERSTOOD ME.  Mike called and made me feel good and told me he understood and promised it would get easier, but for now it's not supposed to be easy.  if it was easy then it would mean Joel hadn't mattered.

5.  I REALIZED HOW LUCKY I WAS TO HAVE FOUND SOMEONE SO GREAT... EVEN IF I LOST HIM.  Even when part of me wishes I'd never met him, there's a bigger part that feels lucky that i had him for at least as long as i did.  and one day i will probably understand why all this happened and appreciate the situation even more.

6.  I FIGURED OUT THE NEXT 9 MONTHS OF MY LIFE.  Doesn't seem like a lot, but it's better than i was doing last night, so i'm happy about it.  I got approved for my minors, and that is huge news to me.

7.  I REALIZED THAT I HAVE A LOT MORE THAN I THOUGHT.  this list is far longer than i thought it would be, and that's a really great thing.

Goodnight, Journal."

Somehow I thought that from this I would gain some sort of newfound independence and selfworth.  To be honest... i just feel like shit.

You know what's funny?  I actually thought that he would miss me so much he would have to call- or have to write an email... or even just IM me to say hello.  I knew it wouldn't happen.  I did.  I knew he wouldn't miss me.  why would he??  for the last two weeks, i have been a lunatic.  I have done nothing but cry and be miserable and he has seen that (well not technically, but you know).  he has no idea how i feel or why i feel this way- and it sucks."

I believed that once you found that person, both of you would do absolutely anything to be together.  Of course you would- because what could be more important than true love that you only find once in a lifetime?

And then I learned the truth.

There is no such thing as true love or that one perfect someone.  I learned that just because you have met what might be the closest thing to the perfect one- they most likely will not agree.  Somehow their puzzle piece fits yours perfectly, yet yours doesn't fit theirs at all.

i feel like Joel sent mike to do his dirty work.  he doesn't have the guts to say ""leave me alone"", so he had mike tell me.  i want to cry, but i'm so sick of having these stupid puffy eyes.  i want to scream at him for hurting me, for not loving me like he should!  but i can't.  though maybe if i'm going to stop talking to him, i might as well...

"event","how can you love someone and hate them at the same time...

i wish i knew.  and i wish the hate would take over the love and i could just hate him.  hate is a much much easier emotion to deal with.  

i MISS him.  i want to see him, want to kiss him and hug him and make love to him and BE with him RIGHT NOW.  and maybe if things hadn't ended i would still miss him as much because he would be my boyfriend and i would want to see him... but my heart wouldn't be broken on top of all that.  and at least he would love me back.  

we've talked this thing to death.  i am so sick of thinking about it.  i just want it all to go AWAY.  i want to be over him, because even if i wouldn't be happy, i would at least not be miserable.  i swear i will never fall for someone again.  

WHY??  Why in the world would i ever choose to go through this again?  I cannot believe how completely devastated I am over someone I have only been talking to for 2 months.  But i can't help it.  i don't understand it.  How in the HELL did i start to fall in love with him??

Maybe it was the way he would stay up all night talking to me until it was 3 and 4 in the morning and we had been chatting for 6 hours straight- and neither of us even noticed.  or the way he makes me laugh every day.  there are so few people that can make me really laugh, and he doesn't even have to work at it.  or the way everything was so perfect and comfortable right from the start as if he was my very best friend and we had been together forever.  The way he looked into my eyes when we layed together.  The way our foreheads touched when we took a breath from a kiss.  The way he made love to me for hours, and was always concerned about ME.  the way he made me feel so safe, even when he wasn't here... just knowing he cared...  

i thought about writing a list of pros and cons... thinking that will help me- i'm sure i can find a way to make the cons outweigh the pros.  but when it came down to it, i could write a book of his good qualities... and the only con is... he doesn't love me back.  and somehow, that all important thing- it doesn't make me love him any less!

oh God i am so miserable.  i feel gross and ugly and even if anyone ever wanted me again, it would take forever to find someone half as great and i don't WANT anyone else.  i don't want someone for the sake of having someone.  that's not me.  i want HIM.  DAMNIT.  i want him.  

i don't know what to DO.  everyone, including me, is so sick of this whole drama... and i have no one to talk to who understands.  and the pain is NOT going away.  

isn't getting over the breakup time supposed to equal one half of your relationship?  ok then, lets say we were together for 44 days before we broke up.  that makes it begin somewhere between when we started talking and when he came to visit (July 1 is where i started).  ok so 22 day grieving period.  September 4th.  if i am not completely over him by September 4th (thats two weeks from yesterday), then i am giving up all hope of ever feeling like a normal human being again.  i just don't know... i don't see it happening.  

i miss him so much."

"event","so i'm doing alright.  not great, and certainly not back to <i>normal</i>, but definitely much better.  

joel and i have kind of talked this thing to death and i have learned nothing new from him.  my friends keep saying ""there's got to be more to it; something you don't know.""  but you know what?  there's not.  it is what it is.  he thinks i'm terrific, he has very strong feelings for me, and he wants to be with me.  but he is not strong enough to handle a long distance relationship- not even for nine months.  so for 9 months we pretend we are just friends, while still crazy about eachother.  we will still have sex, because we both know it will happen when we see each other.  and maybe he thinks that the difference is that i'm not supposed to feel any emotion- but i certainly cannot help that.  last night... on the phone... it was such a release and i cried- but not out of sadness or anger like i have been- it was just such an emotional moment, a relief of 1000 pounds of stress bearing down on my heart.  and it was amazing.  i wished he had really been here.  so we pretend it's not what it is.  and we both go out and have fun, meet other people (which i won't because school is about to be kicking my ass).  and in 9 months... in 9 months we ""reevaluate"".  and if the feelings are still there, then we work it out.  i will be done with school and free to go where i want to go.  we'll try the summer together, possibly.  and if that works, then i'll move to him.  

what this feels like now is something amazingly special and wonderful and i can't bear to let it go.  and while i won't sit and wait for him to figure everything out, i don't know that anyone will compare to him anymore, and i can't definitely say that in 9 months i won't be even more madly in love with him.

i may love him more, or maybe it will turn into something that is no longer romantic and so emotional.  only time will tell i guess.  but i have come to terms with all of it, and i can live with it.  i'll do what it takes at this point in order to have one ounce of a chance that we may end up together."

i don't know what's going on with Joel.  i accidentally sent him this horrible, soul-baring email (one of those things you write, never intending to send) and now we have to talk about it because it's out there and we can't exactly pretend that it's not.  

Lindsey says that i'm right, he is crazy about me and i'm also right that he is scared and confused.  it made me feel better because at least i can believe that he WANTS to be with me, even if he doesn't really know how.  i wish i could just see a year into the future... find out where i'll be, where he'll be.  but if he wasn't there... i'd be sad.  i want him to be part of my future.

by the way, i don't pray much, journal, but if you DO, then maybe you could pray that Joel gets a 20 on his DATs.  maybe i'll even throw a prayer in... i will be so completely thrilled for him if he does well."

"event","so i'm feeling okay at THIS particular moment.  fourteen seconds from now... well i can't make any guarantees.  i suppose i'm punishing myself with all these horrible love songs, but i just want to get it OUT, you know?  i wish it worked that way... sure, it relieves the stress of it all to cry about it, and not keep it bottled up... but it doesn't make the pain any less.

i just don't get why this hurts so much.  probably because i liked him better than just about anyone i've liked.  he's <i>nice</i> to me.  and maybe the shock factors in, since i was so unaware that he was going to do what he did.  

i thought about it today (haha thats funny to say, considering the fact that any given moment i'm NOT thinking about it is a miracle) and you know what?  i must have somehow known, deep inside.  that's the only reason i can explain why i cried before he even told me.  you know me.  i don't just CRY, <i>especially</i> not over things like that.  and CERTAINLY not in front of someone.  i don't really even cry in front of my girlfriends.  but that night i did.  and why??  i don't even know.  i felt like i would miss him... but that doesn't explain it.  missing someone doesn't make me cry.  why didn't i think about that right then and there?  somewhere in my subconscious i must have wondered... known, even... that that was it.  it's the only explanation i can think of.

i wish things could just go back.  i don't know to what point... before i met him?  so i wouldn't have to go through all of this?  but he's so terrific... and even NOW, when i have every right to hate him, and every right to stop speaking to him forever.... i can't.  and i don't want to.  because every day since i have started talking to him, he has made me smile.  he has made me laugh.  he has listened to me, when i needed someone there to listen.  he has been such a good friend.  and as much as i feel like friends is not enough, and i have all the friends i need, he has definitely brightened up the last couple months of my life...

maybe to just before i realized how strong my feelings for him are.  it was all really fun then, and it wasn't at all painful.  but i have to admit, the feelings i have- at least up until sunday- felt pretty amazing.  i don't walk around feeling like i might love someone every day...  and it was nice.  now, though, it just hurts very very bad.

so what point then?  sure, i guess sunday at about 10:00 would be nice... when we were in bed, and the horribly corny thought ran through my mind, ""wow, this is what it feels like to make love""  and it was the first time i had ever felt that.  there was so much emotion there... and it was really completely wonderful.  and right then we could stop time, because moments later, he shattered those blissful thoughts.  

i don't know.  it doesn't matter, because i can't erase it.  more and more though, i want to smoke.  grrr, i need strength.

i don't know what else to say about this.  i've talked about it so much, and i'm totally sick of it.

i hate being sad.  it's why i don't do it often.  i keep my head up even when things are bad, really bad, because smiles do more good than tears.  but now i don't know what to do, what to see that can make me smile.  i can't even laugh at you, and your adorably stupid jokes, because i feel so empty inside and the laughter just won't come.  

i want to shake you.  i want to shake you and scream, ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???""  i want to ask you all the questions swarming my brain and make you feel as ill as i do.  i want to know why.  why am i not good enough to struggle for?  why am i not enough?  what is so wrong with me, that you can't make a struggle, a tiny sacrifice in your life to fit me in?  deep inside i know the answer.  you just don't love me.  because i can't imagine that you could love someone and think they are so amazing and perfect, and let them go because of something stupid as timing and distance.  you just don't.  not if you believe in love, and not if you believe in destiny.  not if you believe, like i do, that to be with that one wonderful person you may just have to struggle and work for it- and then, isn't it worth it in the end?  

you wanted to read my diary.  and part of me wanted you to, too.  wanted you to see the hell and the pain i feel.  wanted you to feel even just an ounce of my pain, seeing what you did to me.  

every time i talk to you, i want to say ""just tell me why i'm not enough"", and ""i miss you"".  but today when i said ""i know i probably am not allowed to say this, but i can't help it... i miss you""  and then followed it up with ""ugh, forget i said that"" (to protect myself of course), you merely said ""forgotten.""  maybe you can forget.  you can go on.  you can sleep at night.  but i can't.  no.  i'm stuck here, this pain in my stomach worsening by the moment, the lump in my throat rising at the stupidest things, at the most inopportune times, while people look at me, pitying me, which only makes it a thousand times worse.  and then i am up all night, screaming and crying in my bed, praying, which i never do, that you will come to your senses and see how wonderful i am, how much i could love you.  and when i do sleep, it's scary and it's not calming and relaxing and i wake up as agitated and afraid as before i fell asleep.

i haven't dreamed about you since that night.  i thank God, because it's bad enough to have to think about you all day.  though i think i have dreamed about you, but just don't remember, because sometimes i wake up sadder than when i went to sleep.  

i want you BACK.  i want you to love me, and take care of me, and hold me and make it alright.  fix things, mr. fix-it.  make it okay.  make me okay.  

i feel so helpless....

even though i am sitting here talking to him... i feel alone.  i feel like it's different.  i can't talk to him the same way.  i feel like suddenly i am talking to a stranger.  someone who i thought i could bare my soul to and tell anything... and then realized i was wrong.  i could tell him anything.  and now i'm afraid to tell him... anything.

so i guess it's over with Joel.  it is.  it is.  

i feel like i am stripped naked, with not a shred of dignity remaining.  how dignified can you be when this incredible person who you may just love, dumps you while in bed with you, when you have no clothes on, and you are 600 miles from anything comforting and familiar?

i feel like nothing is going to fix this.  i know it will be okay eventually.  i know i will be okay.  i just don't know when.  and right now, i really can't imagine how.

i hate this feeling of complete helplessness.  i feel so out of control.  i would do anything right now to feel in control of anything in my life.

did i fall in love with him?  if i did, then i am never falling in love again.  i open myself up; i let someone in.  for <i>once</i>, i let someone in.  and i get my heart broken.

i MISS him.  and it's not fair.  and i love him but i hate him at the exact same time, and i hate this feeling.  i want him HERE.  now.  i want him to hold me and kiss me and say it will be ok, and that he loves me and he will do whatever it takes to be with me.  

i want the fucking fairytale.

but no.  i can't have that.  if i get an ounce of happiness, it has to be washed away with a gallon of misery.  i hate my life.  i hate him right now.

but it's so hard to hate someone you think you may love.  how the hell could i have fallen in love with him?  when did this HAPPEN?  i want it to go away.  i want it to go AWAY.

i secretly thought that like every other bullshit relationship that ends, i would be over Joel by the time i got home.  i cried for the whole ten hours, just to make sure i got it all out- apparently crying all night long wasn't enough.  i'm not over him.  i'm not even close.  i feel like i am completely trapped in this horrible situation.  i feel like i want to crawl in bed forever or crawl right out of my skin.  i want to get away from this.  i want to run away from this pain.

i'm in philadelphia.  it's about 400,000 degrees here.  i like it anyway.

they have tracks right on the road where the trolley goes.  it makes a loud train-ish noise when it goes by, but it really just looks like a bus.  i wish it looked like a streetcar like in SanFransisco.  but i really only have seen them in Rice-er-oni commercials.  ding ding.

also, they have people here that sell food out of carts that look like where they sell elephant ears at the St. Mary's fair.  i wonder if that would be a fun job.  usually when i see someone i think, their job sounds fun, i think i'll be that.  and usually i'm serious, since i have no idea what i want to do.  but when i saw those guys selling V8 Splash and crepes out of an elephant ear cart on a 102 degree day, i did not think it seemed like a fun job.  no.  i do not think i will sell food in an elephant ear cart.  well, at least that narrows down the realm of what i want to be....

what else?  well i've been very busy here.  i have read almost a whole book, played a lot of hand held electronic yahtzee, watched 3 movies, and what-not.  lots of whatnot whatnot.  hahaha  wow been a long time since i said whatnot.  

i miss all my friends at home, because i am so used to having them around all the time.  but this is fun too.  it's really nice to relax.  what's really nice is that i can be alone to read and write.  it's very nice here.

and very very hot.  about 400,000 degrees- did i mention that?

well, back to the tough life of book-reading and story writing.  haha

"event","yawn.... (wow thats funny as i was writing ""yawn"", i actually <i>did</i> yawn!

not much is new.  i need to brush my teeth, and that's KIND of new, since i only woke up half an hour ago.  

i watched Can't Buy Me Love last night.  could there BE a better movie?

today i am going to the library.  i am so incredibly excited.  i think i am becoming a big nerd.  i am going to take out like a million books for Philly.  this will be my very first time going to the library to take out books to read for pleasure and not for school.

ONE WEEK UNTIL PHILLY!!  one week from today, RIGHT now i will be on the road... probably about halfway there.  

Joel is in an incredibly good mood today.  i love it when he's like that.  it's funny.  when i was with Dave, if he wasn't in a good mood, i just about HATED him, and wanted out and sometimes was afraid of him because he could be so mean.  but even Joel's bad moods aren't bad by normal people standards.  and i can tell that it's 100% stress.  i love being with someone i don't have to worry about all the time.  of course, i THINK about him all the time, but i don't worry that he's getting in trouble, or doing drugs; and i don't have to worry that he doesn't like me or that he's sick of me, because he tells me how great i am.  

i love that he tells me that.  most guys just don't SAY things like that, whether or not they feel it.  but he does.  today i was talking about that dream where he was mean, and how he wanted me to leave him alone.  he said ""don't leave me alone.  i'd be lonely then.""  so for all the STUPID things he says, he usually says 20 adorable things to make up for it.  and the nice thing about the stupid things?  they are really just a result of... well... stupidity.  hahaha  no, i mean, he says things without thinking, not intending to sound mean.  typical guy i guess.  even though he's far from typical...

i am writing a story.  I haven't written, aside from my class and this diary, in a very very very long time.  It needs a lot of work, i'll admit that.  But the thing is, i'm WRITING again.  really writing.  i feel a little like i've found something that was lost."

"event","Joel was in town and it was his last night here.  I had to babysit for Bondes so we were planning on hanging out afterwards.  i finished sitting, and decided to take Andrew home to sleep at my house.  he was younger and bundled up in a blue fleece onepiece thingy.  i had him in a big plastic garbage bag in the front seat of my car instead of a carseat.  i called Joel from the Bonde's driveway and he said he was at Market Plaza (the market) and he'd call me when he was done.  this was around 11:30 at night.  by 4 am i was really pissed so i called him again.  he sounded totally drunk and said i had woken him up.  i was really mad then, and i yelled at him saying ""You couldn't even pick up the telephone to call me?!?!""  then he started totally yelling at me saying to stop acting like i was his girlfriend or something.  i was totally hurt and pissed.  then i realized that i was only bringing Andrew home to see how Joel would be with a baby (a la Allison hahah).  

ok, so here goes the book stuff:

- the baby may have been a symbol for an infantile aspect of myself or a newly-emerging personality in myself just beginning to be visible.  the fact that he was completely covered up may mean that i am trying to hide this aspect of myself.  the book says the bag is a place for your favorite attitudes and ideas, but i actually think that it may have symbolized ""baggage"" like something i am struggling to deal with.

of course none of the stuff about Joel is in the book, so i think (and of course, i may be totally wrong) that it all means that i am afraid of that situation or something.  i don't know!

thats all!"

I can't wait.  we are going to have so so so much fun.  i am mostly just looking forward to laying around with him and being lazy together.  

i miss him more than i thought i would.  i would like to try to get out there again a few weeks into the semester, if i can get good rates on flights and can take the time away.  HOPEFULLY i can work out my school schedule so i have Saturdays off and i could leave right after class friday and come home monday morning.  i guess it also depends on his schedule.  hopefully it all works out!!!"

"event","Last night...

Joel asked me to go to the mudslides with him.  I said yes, but asked him to make me some oreo mousse first.  he did, but it had the consistency of beaten eggwhites.  
Then I was at allison's and the mudslides were right outside her house.  It was pouring rain (even MORE fun) and we got on grubby clothes (i had on blue shorts and a St. Mary's College sweatshirt with a navy t-shirt underneath) and Cheri and I went out and played.  Then it turned out we were doing some show for a wedding and we would stick our heads under these awesome shower heads and rinse off the mud- then we'd dive back in again!


ok, so here's what the book says:

- Mud symbolizes slippery footing or an emotional barrier I don't want to move through; implies emotional problems or difficulties clinging to the situation.  I'm not sure though, because in the dream i thought of it more as a sexy thing to do to go to the mudslides with my boyfriend.

- Cooking food means preparing, working with ideas, finding uses for them, and integrating them into your thinking pattern.  Dessert in particular denotes something extra, special treat, climax; just desserts, rewards, the sweet things in life.  Egg (or egg whites) can mean creative force, oneness, wholeness.  

- the end of the dream at allison's house was just bizarre and i'm not even going to bother to interpret it!"

"event","Two nights ago...

Joel and I were making out and we had tanning oil all over us.  It was really cool until he squirted it into my mouth.  I was pissed and I yelled at him.  He did it again and I started beating him up.
 
I woke up sort of grossed out and frustrated because the oil tasted bad and he wouldn't listen to me when i told him no.

ok, so here's the interpretation:
- Sex in dreams expresses your hidden fears or desires.  I'm not sure how this all fits in, since i am in no way wanting to have tanning oil squirted into my mouth.. and if it was, and i told Joel to stop, he DEFINITELY would.

- Oil, though, makes things run more smoothly, removes friction, and heals pain.  MAY BE A HINT TO APPLY MORE LOVE AND CARINGNESS INTO YOUR LIFE, AFFAIRS AND RELATIONSHIPS.

So maybe the dream was saying i'm not applying enough love in my relationship with Joel.  I will admit that as much as i think i DO love him, i don't really show it because i'm afraid of getting hurt."

"event","Three nights ago...

I was at the shoe store where my dad's old friend Stephan (who is a pianist) was working.  At the shoe store, I found a Superwoman costume, tried it on and decided to wear it for Joel.


So, i will tell you what my dream book says....

- A clothing/shoe store symbolizes new attitudes to buy or try on for size.  Buying new shoes denotes new understanding or beliefs which can be helpful or inhibiting.  Shopping means looking around for new ideas, knowledge, attitudes and food for thought.

- Since Stephan is a musician, his presence may have represented the music-making talents in me- my ability to uplift and inspire others, harmonize with others.

- The costume means falsity, playfulness, a light hearted attitude, a false impression, false pride, putting on an act, or hiding the truth.  A Superman (I assume this works for Superwoman also) costume alludes to my above-average talents, ideas, or abilities i may not realize i have.

Alright then.  It seems like my dream has to do with untapped resources inside me.  Like I have some sort of talent that I haven't yet discovered, or i am supressing- maybe having to do with helping people or improving people's quality of life..."

"event","Last night i had an extremely disturbing dream.

Ann Bonde died.  I was sitting for her and her sister (which she doesn't actually have) came over and said that Ann had been attacked.  She ended up dying.  Then I found out that her and Peter were having problems in their marriage so I was thinking he may have killed her.  

I went to the funeral, where I saw Ann in a casket.  it was awful.  At first i was walking down some stairs and i saw the corner of a gray casket and an usher guy told me to come down and i freaked out and said i couldn't.  I don't know what changed my mind.  I didn't know if it was my imagination or her sister's (don't ask me to explain how i would see her sister's imagination- it was a dream after all), but i saw her sister talking to Ann and Ann's lips were moving as if she was talking back.  At the funeral, i was wearing pajamas.  I couldn't find any other clothes to wear.  So the funeral was broken into 3 groups: people that could LOOK at the coffin, people that could WALK BY the coffin and be up close, and then those that could actually hold her hand and talk to her.  I was in the second group and i was furious.  I understood that I wasn't family, but I loved her as much as they did and I wanted the chance to talk to her.

I mourn a lot, and cry hysterically because the last thing i said about her wasn't very nice.

Time passes and it turns out she was pregnant.  Somehow the baby survived though.  Now Peter wanted me to keep sitting, but I really did not want to, because Ann wasn't there.

Then I see blood on the walls.  I don't know how it all happens, because this part is really foggy, but there is blood on the walls- ALL OVER the walls- and i know it belongs to the boys and i freak out.  and i see the boys and they look ok, but since the blood is dried on the walls, i know something had happened.

Suddenly Ann is back.  She is alive.  She and Peter work out their marriage problems.  They talk about an actor who has done so many different kinds of roles, and compare him to me, saying that i have been in three plays, one in which i was an ugly old witch, one a cute puppy, and the third (in Royal Oak) a sexy cat-woman.

I am still disturbed by the fact that Ann was dead and is now alive.  It freaks me out.  I try to put Andrew and Nick to bed.  They won't go.  I tell Nick to stay in his racecar bed.  I bring them downstairs and tell her I'm sorry they won't take naps.  She says it's ok, but why didn't I tell her that she forgot to put an undershirt on Andrew.  I try to explain that I didn't even notice, but she kept asking why I didn't tell her.  I said ""sorry, I've been a LITTLE preoccupied by the things going on around here lately.""

Then the boys were playing with crayons.  First the crayons were just a really basic set, without any purple.  While they played with crayons, we all sorted these big olive-sized things by color.  Then they got better crayons.  I looked over at the blood wall at this time and saw from this angle, that it was covered in dry-blood handprints.

That's all I can remember.  It was really creepy and scary, and i looked it up in my dream book to see what i could find:

- Since the death of a person in your dreams is really the death of the aspect of you they represent, i think it means that either Ann and I will have a falling-out or i will quit that job.

- The casket represents ""dead but not buried"" as if i need to put something behind me.  Its being gray symbolizes fear and depression as well as unclear and undefined.

-Stairs, like the ones I walked down to the funeral, represents moving away from God, moving down to subconscious levels or lowering myself

-My inappropriate attire at the funeral may have been saying I feel ridiculous in the situation i'm in or saying I have an absurd attitude about the situation.  Pajamas in particular may denote my inability to cope with the situation.

-Dried blood indicates old wounds, old karma, and possibly bad karma i am creating by my present action.

-The part with the acting may be saying that I have many facades, since both the actor and I had played many different roles.

-I don't know what the crayons themselves symbolize, but the original lack of specifically purple may denote a lack of one-ness with God and compassion.

-I'm not sure what the handprints mean, but hands symbolize service, working, having a hand in a situation.  Since the handprints were outstretched with the fingers up, it may mean victory, praise, plea and devotion; or it could mean halt.

So I think I am supposed to stop and analyze my situation working for the Bondes, since i have not been totally happy there lately.  I think i have lost the desire to do that job and i need to let go or find a way to love it again."

"event","i took Joel to the airport this morning.  it was sad when he left.  it was one of those airplanes you walk up stairs to get on instead of through a tunnel.  as i was walking through the terminal to go to my car, i looked out a huge window and saw him getting on the plane.  really missed him then.

this was the best weekend ever.  

i went to the bookstore after i dropped him off, because there was so much traffic i thought i'd keep busy until rush hour was over.  i swore i saw him in the store and i really missed him then too.

bought 4 books but only spent $55.  pretty good.  i'm in need of some good reading material.  one is called 4 Blonds and it's by the writer of Sex and the City.  i'll let you know how it is.  

might go rent some old movies today and veg out and watch them.  thinkin' Can't Buy Me Love...

i feel really sad that he's not here anymore- but no i didn't cry.  i mean, i will see him in just over 3 weeks so i can't be too sad.  i made it through the last 3 weeks (before he came)- i can do it again.

i'm not sure... but i think... i'm his girlfriend.  maybe.

he was whining about how early we got to the airport (he's my opposite in that respect- i am always way early for everything- he likes to get there by the tail of his pants), and i said ""well, it's ok, i'm going to wait with you!""  and i could absolutely swear he said, ""you better wait with me... or- you can just find another boyfriend!""  i didn't say anything, because sometimes my mind and my ears play tricks on me.  and i just wasn't sure...

we have amazing chemistry in every aspect.  we make each other laugh.  we are VERY compatible in bed... we just click.  he's amazing and wonderful and perfect.  except he lives eight hours away.  but i don't even care.  i think he's the best thing ever in the whole world, and i really think that this may, in fact, work.

i am happy."

"event","the whole day of sleep was filled with dreams that are now jumbled up like crazy....


Joel was being a big cry-baby.  literally he was crying.  about something totally stupid.  it was funny.  we were in the car and leslie was in the back with me and some other girl while Joel was in the passenger seat and his mom drove.  Les said ""Jeez this would drive me crazy""  as she poured the contents of a pixie stick all over my car.  i said ""this would drive me more crazy""  and i poured the remainder of the pixie stick all over her head.



we were at Joel's house.  we met his mom.  Joel was in the kitchen with the door shut being yelled at by his dad.  we all left and in the car i leaned up and asked Joel if everything was ok with his dad and him.  he said yeah, everything was cool.

we realized that we were on our way to a funeral (it was still me and leslie and some other girl) and we were like ew yuck, we don't want to go to a funeral!  but we got there (and suddenly we weren't with Joel's family and Joel anymore, we were in our own car, and we saw that you had to PAY to get in to the funeral!!  we were like ""yeah right"" until we saw that it was a RIDE!  like Pirates of the Carribean!  so of course, Leslie and i were like ""who cares if it's a funeral?  it's a RIDE!!""  so we try to gather enough change to go on the funeral ride.  i have a whole bunch and then somehow i lose half of it, but don't think much of it.  until Joel's dad grabs it out of the water and asks if i lost it.  he was really nice and laughing.  i said ""oh yeah, i knew i put that SOMEWHERE!""  

next thing i knew Joel and i were fighting and i didn't know why.  we went out in the woods to talk about it.  he told me that he had slept with a girl a while back and she said she was pregnant so he MARRIED her, but it was annulled the same day because he found out it wasn't his baby.  he called her his ""bride"".  i was like WHAT???  haha

so i said a whole bunch of really nice things to him.  ""Joel you are the single most wonderful, attentive, sweet, caring guy i have ever met.  i am so incredibly lucky to have someone like you in my life...."" etcetera etcetera   

then i was at my house and a bunch of people were sitting around the breakfast nook and stacey walked in completely naked from the waist down!!  i was like ""ok....""  and someone started to ask and she was like ""i DON'T even want to get into it""  

then there was this wierd thing about my brother.  it was a little confusing, but i'll tell it the best i can.  he was pretending to be from the future and being goofy.  then i said ""oh my gosh i had a dream that you were first a guy from the past and then a guy from the future""  i told him about the dream.  the guy from the past looked like a logger kind of guy with a big thick beard and some plaid.  i was like ""what is someone from the past going to teach me?""  and he was like ""i bet that if you were lost without food or a home you would have no idea how to find some oats and cook them up.  i got out a packet of oatmeal and whipped some up, raising my eyebrows to prove my point.  he was very disgusted.   
Josh of the future looked like a mix between a human and a scary alien with big eyes.  he was slightly green.  he told me he was from the year 2066 (said twenty-sixtysix) but this was not just 65 years in the future since somewhere down the line the number system had been switched from base 10 to base 6 (don't worry about the fact that 6 cannot be a digit in base 6 numbers).  so he was from way in the future.  i don't think he told me much else but it was pretty creepy anyway.

the last thing i dreamed was that i was checking my AOL instant messenger to see who was on, and there was Joel's name withan away message that said he had gone home.  i was really sad because i didn't get to say goodbye."

...twice.

i had a great night.  a great morning.  a great weekend.  maybe i am falling in love.  i have no idea.  i don't want to know one way or the other.  i've thought i was in love before and realized later i wasn't.

i was so incredibly nervous at the airport, i kept passing the place i needed to park, which tacked an extra <i>hour</i> onto my drive time.  yuck.  i finally parked and beautified and then found my way to gate B-3A, which was not nearly as hard to find as i had imagined.  i sat down and tried to busy myself with the bottle of water i had just bought and my hand-held-elecronic-yahtzee.

i was shaking.  i could honestly feel my heart pounding in my chest.  i was <i>sweating</i>.  ick.  

i went to the bathroom because being nervous makes me yawn and yawning continuously makes my nose runny.  

there were 20 open seats at the gate.  a black woman, her two kids and her friend sat down in the seats RIGHT next to me and ate chili dogs.  my stomach was queasy enough already, didn't they know???  

a lady sitting across from me about 15 feet away kept smiling at me.  i felt like she somehow knew my situation by the looks of my anxiety.  she silently consoled me.

at 6:30 i decided to double-check with the man at the desk that i was, in fact, at the correct gate.  he said i was, and that the plane was there.  i said, ""i'm sorry, i think you misunderstood- i'm asking about the 6:55 flight.""  he said, ""maybe you misunderstood- the flight is HERE.""  he was smiling though and i think he too sensed my nervousness.  he told me that the passengers would be coming up the staircase.

i sat down.  i made myself incredibly busy with hand-held-electronic-yahtzee.  large straight.  three of a kind.  four 2's.  everytime someone walked up the stairs i took a peek, and then instantly went back to my game when it wasn't him.  i had planned to do this even if it was him.  i was too nervous to look at him- for him to see me.

but there he was.  and as soon as i saw him, i couldn't NOT look at him.  suddenly all the people- the nice lady, the airport man, the chilidog eaters- disappeared.  it was just us.  and it was exactly how i wanted it to be.  all my nervousness vanished.  i felt so completely comfortable with him- instantly.  

we hugged and walked aimlessly through the corridors of the airport, since i somehow forgot where to go.  

found the car and drove home, chatting like crazy the whole way.  we got back to my house and he met my brother.  he was friendly to him.  he was personable.  he was the kind of person that would have a conversation with someone he didn't know.  it was so nice.

he played with Chewy and petted him so gently and i couldn't help but stare at his hands, wishing that was ME his gentle hands were on.  

we played Life- and he let me win.  when he made money he would say we should take a trip.  we decided to go to an island.  we were silly and goofy and exactly the same as we've been on the phone and computer.  we listened to TV theme songs.

and then we layed there.  we just held eachother and he was so warm and it was so safe and wonderful.  i experienced the most UN-awkward first kiss of my life.  there was no thinking, exept for me marveling at how i feel like we've been together forever.  i could kiss him forever.

we layed on the couch and wished mike would forget where my house was.  

dinner was fantastic.  he was so sweet and a gentleman, and he helped warm me up when i was shivering because it was freezing.  he even had the manager come turn up the heat for me.  it was the single most wonderful thing a guy has ever done for me.  

at the end of dinner Lindsey and i went to the bathroom and chit-chatted a little bit.  i told her how i hadn't eaten all day because i was so nervous.  she was so adorable.  she told me it seemed like Joel and i had been together forever (just how i felt).  i laughed and then she was like ""oh oh not that i'm saying you're TOGETHER- i don't want to freak you out or anything.""  and i was so amused that she said that.  i really loved her then.  i suddenly realized that she's 18.  she acts 18.  she doesn't try to act like she's not 18.  and i loved that about her.  she's real.  she's not trying to be someone else so people will think she's cool.  it was really refreshing.

and so they all went back to Lindsey's house, which was totally fine, because i am exhausted and i don't want to have to entertain tomorrow, since i need a good night's sleep.

hopefully i will get to see Joel tomorrow, but if not i will have to keep myself busy until saturday!  i just can't wait to see him again..."

i have no idea what kind of perfume to wear.  

i have not eaten since this morning at 8:00 when i had a Nutri-grain Bar.  I am starving but i think if i eat i will vomit.

i have a bad feeling.  i am listening to songs on my winamp playlist on random and the worst songs are coming up.  that's not a funny trick, God.

this is the longest hour.  it's 3:45.  i am leaving at 4:30.  it's not really even an hour.  i feel like leaving now.

sometimes it's 3:30 in the morning and i have so much energy i would do anything to work THEN and take the next day off.  thats a little how i feel now.

my stomach feels very gurgly.  

got my nails done today- looks good.  my brother said that my toenail polish makes me look like a hooker.  huh.  and i thought it was pretty.  wait till he sees my outfit on saturday.  then he'll really have something to say.  he may even tell me i am not going out in that shirt.  but i am.  haha

Jesus, how can it only be 3:48????  it's been like half an hour since i said it was 3:45!!

i just checked his flight status.  it's going to be on time and his first leg was on time.  good good.  it says gate B-3A.  what does that MEAN??  aren't they usually something like B-4?  do i go to the B gates or the A gates?

this is way too much stress.  i'm sure that i have an ulcer.  haha 

i feel like i'm forgetting something... can you think of anything?  

well, i should go let the dog out and take that plate upstairs and put it in the dishwasher.  oh and fix my hair.

only 37 minutes till i leave...

ok, wish me luck

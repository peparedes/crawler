"event","I'm sorry.  I'm a boring, busy person.  It's been a while too.  But I wanted to share a few photos of Johnny and his new friends.   We went on a cruise to Mexico for Johnny's 12th Birthday.  Which is a big deal to be 12 on a cruiseship.   You are no longer treated like a child.  You don't have to wear these id bracklets once your 12.   Johnny hated those things.  So it was a huge right of passage for him.    
On his birthday, he got to be a trainer for a day in Puerto Vallarta.  He had a great time with the sea lions and dolphins.  It was up close and personal.  More so than at Sea World.  He spend a good 5 hours hanging out with this mammals.   He was in heaven.

"event","So Johnny's swim practice isn't going so well.   He says that it is too hard to swim for 2 hours straight.   I drop him off and by the time I get back to pick  him up about 20 minutes before the end of practice, he isn't swimming laps anymore.  He is on the other side of the pool just messing around.  I ask him how long he practices  and he says like 1hr. 15 min., but I don't really know how long he has been messing around.   To me, I feel like I'm just wasting my money if I let him just goof off.   So I'm seriously thinking about pulling him out.   Not just because he doesn't like it, but it is definitely a major factor.  $40 is kind of a lot of money if it's going to waste.   It also takes a lot of time out of already busy week for him to spend 2 days at the pool.    

He is busted right now anyway.  I got an e-mail from teacher saying that he isn't doing his work in class.  Not to mention that he has been getting F's on his History and Science tests.  I don't get it.  Last year, those were his best subjects.  So what happened.  He has been irresponsible in his responsibilities.   Last Wednesday he was suppose to take something to the front office (fundraiser stuff with checks).   Well when I looked in his backpack on Saturday, the stuff was still in there.   

What am I going to do with this kid?????   This is why I hate school and look forward to summers.   We don't have to deal with all this stuff in the summer.    IS IT SUMMER YET?"

"event","Do you ever get bored at work and just Google something you've been interested in finding out more about?
Well I was curious as to why the U.S. has a navel base in Cuba.  How did that all come about?   I kinda figured it was something that was forced upon them after the Cuban Missle crisis.   Well this is what I find out:
That is was an agreement between Bautista (pre-revolution Castro)and the U.S.   We leased the land for $2000 a year.  And basically the legalities of the agreement say it's an open ended agreement until BOTH parties decide to dissolve it.  Well Castro has always wanted to dissolve it, but U.S. keeps this base for none other than political reasons.   Well, I guess they are making some use of it now.
Here is the funny part I read:
""Since 1959, the U.S. sends a check for the lease amount every year, but the Cuban government has never cashed them.""

I got a chuckle out of that one."

"event","Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.  Mine was ""interesting"", but nice.
We drove to Bakersfield on Thanksgiving morning.  I was asked to fry the turkey, so I asked my parents to bring the fryer, which was stored at their place.  So 2 1/2 hours before the dinner and when I was suppose to start preparing to fry the turkey, I discover that they brought the other fryer that hadn't been assembled yet.  ""Oh well, I'll just take a few minutes to put the thing together.  No, but wait, where are all the parts to this thing?""  Not there!  That's where!  The stupid fryer was missing parts so I couldn't even put it together.  So I go inside and announce that we have a little problem.  So my cousin and I decided that she would go to the grocery store and start buying the stuff so we could bake the turkey and I would go to the only store open on Thanksgiving ""K-Mart"" to see if they have a fryer.  They don't, so we end up baking a turkey and eating at 8pm.  Oh well, it all turned out quite nice.
Friday my mom and I went to go see my uncle who has been in the hospital for a month now.  What's the problem?  Don't really know.  He can feel his legs and move them, but he can't walk.  He's very depressed and doesn't want to do anything.  Not like he did much of anything anyways, so not much has changed.  He sleeps and watches TV all day.  I'm not sure what their plan is.  Perhaps  a rehab center?  Who knows.   
Then we went over to see my grandmother who has alsheimer's.  We went over to give her a bath and feed them lunch, so my aunt could have the day off from doing all of that.  My grandmother is funny, but I'm glad I don't have to deal with her every day.   She didn't want to take her shower.   My mom would say ""Come on mom, let's go take your shower""  and my grandmother would yell ""NO"" and laugh hysterically.   And she would say the same stuff over and over again.   She kept telling my how beautiful I am, but I've got a big belly.  :)   no duh grandma.  :)  She's cute though and I love her.    It's funny how she can remember us when we go to her house, but if we are someplace else; like my cousins house for Thanksgiving, she didn't really know anybody.   

I'll get back to this journal later.  I need to watch TV now.  :)"

"event","Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

I'm trying to think of ideas for Christmas for Johnny.  Now he wants a Wii thingie.  So I might get him that.  But I'm also really thinking about getting him a $100 gift card to Home Depot.  Why Home Depot?  He's been bugging me for almost a year that he wants to paint his bedroom.  We are going to have some time off right after Christmas.  So why not surprise him with the gift card and we can go down together and pick out a color and supplies and start painting his room.  I really think he would think that was cool.  

The tough one is my parents.  What on earth do I buy my mom & dad?   Any brilliant ideas?

Did I mention that Johnny turned 11 years old last week?  My gosh, where the the years go?  We didn't do much.  I took him to eat seafood one day and we went to Sea World last weekend.  He says he wants a tattoo when he turns 18, but I told him that he better make sure that if he still plans on being a dolphin trainer at Sea World he better find out what kind of policy they have on tattoos.  So when we went, he went right up to one of the trainers and asked the question.  She said as long as it doesn't show with a wetsuit on, he would be okay.   Cute kid.

Did anyone happen to watch a few weeks back on Inside Edition about how some fishermen in Japan kill dolphins for food.  Well I happened to be watching it and thought Johnny would be interested in seeing.  I knew it was pretty gruesome to watch, but I thought it might be something important for him to watch.  I guess I was thinking kinda along the lines of allowing kids to watch and learn about the Holocaust.  Pretty gruesome, but an important thing to learn about.   Well that was a BIG MISTAKE on my part.  Poor kid, cried himself to sleep that night and can't stop thinking about it.  Not to mention now he hates Japanese people.   I try to explain to him that not all the Japanese people eat dolphin and there were plenty of Japanese people trying to ward off the fisherman.  But I can't get him to understand that.    I don't know what I was thinking.  I feel terrible."

"event","I'm home and safe.  I came home to a mess though on Thursday evening.  And then I had a message on my answering machine that if we could, we had to come back to work on Friday.  ""There goes my cleanup day""  
I haven't heard yet from my 2 ""friends"" that I was worried about who live in Rancho Bernardo.  But for the most part, so far I don't know anybody personally that lost a house.  One of my mom's co-workers lost her house.  Who by the way, lived just 2.5 miles away from me.   A little too close for comfort.   
My other friend who's husband passed away about a month ago, I'm pretty sure her house was saved.  That's only according to a website that was listing houses lost.  So that is good news.  However, she also has another house up in Lake Arrowhead and many houses there burned down too.  She isn't able to get up there yet to see if her house is still standing.  And I can't find any information on the web to find out.  I really hope her Arrowhead house is okay.   
Funny, last Saturday I spent all day dusting, vacuuming, etc.  What a big waste of time.  The fires just left a mess.  Actually not as bad as it could have been.  But my patio was covered in soot.  Unfortunately, my camping stuff was still on the patio when the fires came through.  So today, I spent the morning cleaning up my camping stuff and washing my patio.  Man was it dirty.  Partially because it was dirty even before the fires.  But now it looks good and I threw out a bunch of junk back there too.  
Oh, over the week, Johnny and I watch the first 3 Harry Potter movies.  I had never seen them before.   Pretty cool movies.   We plan on watching the 4th one tonight.   Yes, I was a HP virgin.  But no longer.   :)

Jason:   How are you parents?  I hope the fire didn't get their home.  Are they able to go home yet?   I here Ramona is a big mess right now.   No water (at all) for a few days.  Now they can only use it for flushing toilets.  Not much of a home without usable water.  Especially when people are anxious to clean up their homes."

So I've been at my mom's since yesterday afternoon.    As far as I know, I still don't think they've technically evacuated my area though.   So I'm gonna try to drive back over there today to get some things I forgot.   

These fires are actually going to burn right to the ocean.  For those of you who know the area, it started in mountains near Ramona and it's already burned through Rancho Santa Fe and now they are evacuating Del Mar, Solana Beach & Encinitas.  Those are town right on the beach.   The entire town of Fallbrook was evacuated and I wouldn't doubt that some of my friends that live in that area lost their homes.   My friend who lost her husband about a month ago is one of those people that I think might of lost her home.  So sad."

"event","San Diego is on fire again.  Schools are closed and Johnny & I are at home.  The fire is about 3 or 4 miles southeast of us.  I think we are pretty safe though since the wind is blowing southwest.  Unfortunately, watching TV, I already know of at least 2 people I know that have probably lost their home in the Rancho Bernardo area.  Several of friends and co-workers have been evacuated.  The hospital in Poway was even evacuated.

I'm tired.  I've been up since 3am watching TV just making sure that we are in a safe place.  So far we are.

Exactly 4 years ago, we had the same type of fires.  Those fires came within about 1 mile of my house that time.  I think as long as Valley Center doesn't catch fire, we will be okay.  THey are already saying that this fire will be worse than that fire 4 years ago.  

It's kinda scary because the wind is TERRIBLE.  Reminds me of tornado winds.  A large tree in front of my house fell down last night.  I took Johnny and my doggie to work with me this morning.  But they told us that most of us could just go home.  So we went home.   

Okay, gotta go.  Wind is really picking up and I'm starting to really smell smoke."

Johnny tried out for the Bells at school.  At his school, its quite a big deal to play the bells.  I just love the way they sound when they play.  And the music teacher does a great job at teaching it.   Anyways, I was so happy when he came home last week and announced that he made the bell team.   I'm more excited then him I think.  I can't wait until their first concert."

"event","About 3 weeks ago Johnny, my cousin, and I went to Anaheim to see the Yankees play.  It's actually been quite a few years that we've had pretty good seats.  Probably the last 3 or 4 years we have had nose bleed seats.  Now I'm not complaining or anything, cuz any day I can see my Yankees is a good day.  But this year, we had View Level seats in left field.  We didn't need binoculars to figure out who we were looking at.  And some nice views of BUTTS!  Oh, Derek and A-Rod have some pretty awesome butts.   Made me feel like a teenager gawking at all the cute butts.  I guess I'm still a kid at heart.   We had a good time, but they ended up losing in OT.   

On Labor Day it was 108 degrees in Escondido.  Okay, I know that's probably nothing compared to Phoenix, but it was awful.  Thank God my A/C is working at the moment.  It could go at any moment, so I'm grateful for the time it does work.   The next day it was only 101 degrees.   Ah, it felt so cool compared to the 108.   Today (Wednesday) it's back to normal.  It was probably 88 degrees or something.   VERY NICE!    I got my electric bill today too.  The last few months, it's been about $50-60.  Today it was $134.   OUCH!  To me, that's a whole lot of money."

"event","Johnny started 5th grade today.  Wow!  I can't believe how old he is getting.  He says he likes his teacher, Mrs. Sjorbing.  I'm trying some new things out on him this year to help him stay on track.  I made a schedule for him and he is suppose to do everything on that schedule before he can turn the TV on.  OKay, today, he got to turn the TV on at 8:50.  That only left him 40 minutes before bedtime.  But he should be able to get more done on other days.   Mondays are long days because he has a piano lesson at 6pm.  Which makes everything late.  We usually don't get to eat dinner till about 7:30.  
I subscribed to a Spelling Aid website that will hopefully help him with his spelling.  Basically, I enter his spelling words each week and everyday, he logs on to the website and practices his words for 15 minutes.  Hopefully, by the end of the week, those words will have stuck in his head long enough to get good grades on his test.   If he does good on his tests, he gets rewarded.   Right now he is into iTunes.  So I'll probably let him download a few songs every week he does a good job.   
Man, I hope we have a good school year this year.  Not that he's ever had a bad year, it's just always been really stressful for me."

"event","I thought I would journal before I started catching up on what everyone has been up too.   

Okay, I went on a cruise back in February.  FUN FUN FUN!  We flew into Miami and it was cold and rainy.  Gosh, I could have stayed home and got cold and rainy at that time.   But the rain stopped when we went sight seeing.  But it was still chilly.  What did we do in Miami?   We went to Little Havana and ate, then ate some more, and ate again.   Oh how I love cuban food.  It was pretty cool experiencing the whole cuban culture.  We walked along Calle Ocho and stood at a walk up cafe and drank cafe cubanos like there was no tomorrow.   (Note:  too many cafe cabanos causes you to be wide awake at 2 in the morning)    We went to a Brazilian restuarant.  That was a carnivorous' dream come true.  Meat, meat and more meat.    Oh, I found the ultimate Mojito in Miami too.  At a cuban restaurant Versailles, they put sugar cane in their Mojitos.  AWESOME!    We also ate tapas at a Spanish restaurant.   So most of our three days in Miami was spent in Little Havana.  We did manage to drive along Ocean Blvd. in South Beach and saw Versace's house.    Oh, I bought Johnny a guayaberra shirt (authentic cuban shirt).  
On our cruise we went to Bahamas, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, and Haiti.  It rained on us at every place except Haiti.  But it was cold, so a little water didn't bother us.  Had a little to much to drink AGAIN in St. Thomas by those dirty Pirates.   
Puerto Rico, my beloved Puerto Rico.   We weren't there for very long (only a few hours), so we did a little shopping and ate at our favorite restaurant in Old San Juan.   We went to this one store that made art out of butterflies.  I couldn't help myself, I had to buy one.  So I have a little box with two beautiful butterflies.  I plan on hanging it in my living room.
Other than that, nothing too exciting happened on our cruise.   It was fun, but I kinda missed Johnny.  So I was very happy to get home.

I got the remodel bug so I painted my living room.  Which meant I had to pull down these STUPID mirrors and wallpaper that had been in my house since we've lived there.  Let's see, we moved there in 1991 so that's 16 years that crap had been up there.  It looked totally like 70's disco crap.  I'm glad to have that off my walls.   I am usually not into being bold and experimental, but I decided to go with some BIG color.  Okay, just one color, but different shades.  I have a very GREEN living room now.   But now that I look at it, I think I went too crazy with the green.  I think I'll repaint the doors and light switch covers an off-white or something.  

This weekend, I'm having laminate flooring put in my living room.   Oh am so excited about that.  Very excited!   I can hardly wait.  It's gonna look so pretty.

So when I finally upload all my pictures to a computer, I'll post a few."

"event","This is the second time in a row that Johnny missed the honor roll at school.  He got a D in Band.  Which is totally stupid, because his grade is solely based on how long he practices at home.   I don't really think Johnny needs to practice as long as some of the other kids to be as good as them.  I think he is just naturally gifted in music.  Although I do think that if he did practice longer he would be great.   Oh well!   His other grades were good though.  Oh, he decided to quit band for this semester.  Which I'm fine with.   He doesn't really have time to practice playing the trumpet as long as they want him too.   Next year he wants to try out for the Bells.   I know, I know!   It sounds totally stupid, but if any of you have ever heard a Bell Choir (or whatever you call them), MAN it is so beautiful.  The band teacher said that he should do well in the tryout for bells because all the piano kids do well.    

I swear I had a dream the other day about Shakesrear and her daughter Aston.  I don't really remember what the dream was about other than thinking that Aston didn't really look like all the pictures we've seen.   WEIRD!

Johnny & I are going out for Sushi for Valentine's Day and then I'm off to Miami for my vacation.   He tends to be an expensive date.  He can really put down the sushi."

But I take her outside in the mornings, lunchtime, and when we get home from work.  She's my little nature girl.  She loves to eat daisies and roll around on the grass.   Okay, she likes to eat dried up worms too and she is attracted to cigarette butts too.   

Johnny, my mom and I have SeaWorld season passes now.  When we went on Saturday, Johnny bought some fish to feed to the dolphins.  Before he would give the dolphins food, he would give them a hand signal to do a trick and the dolphins would do it.  That was pretty cool.    He learned some hand signals for his birthday when he did the Dolphin Interaction Program at Sea World.   

Has anyone ever been to Miami?   I'm going there in a little over 2 weeks from now for 2 days before my cruise.   Was just wondering what people did there.  I want to have the ""Cuban"" experience.  So we plan on walking Calle Ocho and eating at some cuban restaurants, hopefully see some local cuban artwork, listen to cuban music.  I'm getting kind of excited.    I was just reading that when Fidel Castro dies, they plan on having a HUGE party in Miami.   Could I be so lucky and have Fidel die when I'm in Miami.   'Course I don't really know how Cubans party.  Might be kind of dangerous."

"event","I only get excited during post season NFL if there are teams playing that I'm interested in.   Usually, it's not particular teams that I'm interested in, but rather specific players.     One being Jeff Garcia, who now plays for the Eagles.  He use to play for the 49'ers and was one of the last good QB for the 49'ers.  This year he was backup QB for the Eagles and when McNabb was injured, Garcia got his big chance again and got his team into the playoffs.   They won the wildcard last weekend.   I hope they go far.
And then there's the home team Chargers.   Okay, maybe I'm a fair weather fan of theirs, but it's always neat to see a whole city get excited about their team.   So I hope they go to the SuperBowl.   And I really like LT.   He does so much for the community here in San Diego and is just a very nice guy.  I was glad he got this years NFL's MVP award.  He definatly deserved it.
I'm probably asking the wrong people, but did anyone watch the Seattle-Dallas game last weekend.   What an awesome game!   I just love to watch exciting games like that."

"event","Today we had a gift exchange at work.  Just like we do every year.  We each fill out a little piece of paper with 3 ideas for the person who gets our name.  That makes it nice so that the person doesn't end up getting something they really didn't want or need.   This year I wrote down I would like (The Pirate DVD, candles, or shower gel).   Simple enough, right?     And beings that this Christmas, I don't think I have any ""presents"" to open, I was kinda excited about the little gift exchange.  The reason I'm not getting and presents to open for Christmas is because we scaled down on gift giving and my parents would be the only one giving me a present anyways and she is giving me a cruise to the Caribbean in February.    I love her for that, so why am I complaining about this stupid gift exchange incident?     

Anyway, back to my story.    So everyone is giving out there gifts and at the end, someone announces ""Okay, who didn't get anything yet""   Well that would be me.  So I'm givin this ""generic"" gift of Tupperware canisters.   It's from one of our janitors.  And of 'course I didn't let it be known that I was disappointed, but I was.    My guess is that he completely forgot who he was suppose to buy something for and didn't even bother to look at what I had written down.   GEEZ!    

And I was really looking forward to getting the Pirate DVD.   

MY CHRISTMAS IS RUINED!    joking, but a little disappointed.

Oh, and a few years ago something similar happened.  I wrote down that I wanted a Nativity Set.   Well I got a giant ceramic angel.   I DIDN'T WANT AND ANGEL, I WANTED A NATIVITY SET PEOPLE!"

Geez, he's only 10 years old.  I told him I would try to remember that, but it's going to be difficult.
.....................................
Johnny (oops) John had the stomach flu on Wednesday.  Yucky stuff man.   I'm hoping I don't get it.  I don't have time to be that sick.   His last day of school is today.

Samantha, our new puppy is doing great.  I thought she was a genius the first week.  She had no accidents in the house and she did her business outside everytime I took her.   Then this week, she's had a setback and I've been cleaning up poop and piss from the house.   But I have to realize she is a puppy and she will eventually figure it out.    She's still a great dog though and I love her.   Her brother Nigel (my mom's dog)doesn't want anything to do with her though.   He tries to keep as far away from her as possible.   It's cute though, cuz she'll chase after him and he'll just keep running away until she gives up.    Hopefully one day he will learn to love her.    They are spending all next week together.
.....................................
I think that's all.  Nothing to exciting going on here.   I recently met up with an old friend from grade school and a few days ago he said that he had this old ""scrapbook"" of our 5th grade camp out.  So he said he would show them to me soon.    That was kind of funny."

THEN, we decide to go puppy hunting.  We called a few places and the first place we went to Johnny fell in love.   Actually, it was quite a weird story.   Johnny wanted either a chihuahua or a basset hound.  But I wasn't real enthusiastic about the whole chihuahua thing.  Chihuahuas tend to have the LITTLE DOG complex.   Cute, but not very nice at all.  Very hard to train, etc.    However, my mom has a very good chihuahua (Nigel) and I kinda had in the back of my head that I wouldn't get a chihuahua unless it was a sibling of Nigel.   Well low and behold the one place we decided to check out turned out to be the exact same people who sold my mom her dog.   So I agreed with Johnny that we should definately take one home.    So he picked a little girl and named her Samantha."

...............................
I did a dumb thing the other day.  I'll have to add it to my list of dumb things I've done in my life (it's actually quite long).  I ordered an electric guitar for Johnny's Christmas present.  I had it sent to my parents' house so Johnny wouldn't find out.   Turns out nobody would have found out cuz I sent it to my mom's old house.   DUH!  Boy that was stupid.  I guess I'm just so use to giving out her old address it came so automatic.    So today I have to go to their old house and pick it up."

"event","Snouches nudged me into journalling.  

Johnny and I have pretty much decided that YES we want a dog as part of our family.  So I've been searching online for something we might like and last week we even went out to the Humane Society to see what they have.   Johnny fell in love with this beautiful Alaskan Malamute, but we were definately not taking that giant of a dog home.   So we didn't see anything that we could both agree on.    Then we went over to look at the cats and he decided he wanted a cat.  But I was not prepared to adopt a cat.   After we left, we both decided that a cat was not really what we wanted.
I kept coming back to how sweet of a dog (Chihuahua) my mom has.  For a chihuahua, he is so not like other chihuahuas.   So I e-mailed my cousin to see if she still kept in contact with the people my mom bought her dog from to see if they still have the parents of ""Nigel"" (mom's dog).   She said that they had just had a litter and she would find out if there were any left.    Unfortunely she e-mailed me back to say that there were no more puppies for sale.     But that she would let us know the next time they had babies.
So, Johnny and I have decided to wait it out and wait until we can get a sibling of Nigel's.   Who knows how long that will take, but we are both willing to wait."

She is going to have to go through the mess of papers and figure out which account lines were used incorrectly.   
I felt really good about myself because normally I'm such a people pleaser and will stress myself out to help someone else out.  So telling somebody ""no"" is very difficulty for me.  But I did it and it feels great.

My parents have decided to sell their house and find a smaller condo or townhouse.  Apparently, they can no longer afford to live where they live.   I'm happy that if they buy something smaller, they won't have anymore housepayments, but I am very sad about them selling that house that they've lived in for over 30 years.  And it's still a beautiful house.  My dad worked all those years to make the house what it is today and to think that we will never be able to enjoy it again.  I guess I just have to remember that my dad isn't the same man he use to be (with the Parkinson's and all) and that a smaller house would be much better for them in the long run.   He won't have to keep up with the yardwork anymore.   But then I'm also afraid without the yardwork, he will just sit in the house all day and do nothing.  Which is not good for someone with Parkinson's.  They need to keep busy or they stiffen up and CAN'T do anything.    

Summary:   Happy that I stood up for myself, but sad that my parents are selling my childhood home.    Could this me melancholy?"

He was a little scared to see great-grandma in her coffin.  I didn't force him to see her, but after a while he took a peek and said that she looked real good.  She did actually.   She just looked like grandma was sleeping.   After the service they had to rent out a hall to fit all of her family for a gathering.   13 children plus their spouses, a ton of grandkids, and more great-grandkids.

But I have always found that rather boring.  It's nothing but eating and sitting around watching TV all day.  And I'm not into the type of shows that they like to watch (SCIFI & Cowboy movies).   Not to mention, my aunt had forwarned my mom at how bad the conditions were at my grandma's house.  She has alzheimer's and according to my aunt, the place is filthy and grandma is declining.     So this year, I decided to drop my parent off at grandma's house and I would stay with my cousin Sarah.    
I think my aunt was overexaggerating, because the house wasn't that filthy and grandma actually looked quite good.   Yes, she had forgotten how to take a bath, but someone helps her take one every other day.  And yes, we have the same conversation with her over and over and over again.  But for the most part, she looked pretty good.  But I was glad I didn't have to stay their and be BORED to death.   Not my idea of a fun weekend.    
The first night, Johnny stayed the night at his cousin's house and I went to my cousin's house.    The next evening, we had a Wonka party.   We watched both the Wonka movies and noshed on goodies and Wonka candy.  The next night, my cousin Sarah and I went to a dinner party at my gay cousin Patty's friends house.   We had a good time with her friends.   I ended up spending that night back and my grandmother's house because I wanted to get up early the next day to drive back home.   BIG MISTAKE.   I hardly got any sleep.   Her stupid cat pounced on my head and stratch my face while I was trying to sleep and I light in the kitchen turned on all by itself.   I was afraid to go to sleep because of that EVIL cat.  Then early in the morning everyone woke up and sat in the living room (where I was trying sleep) to talk.   GEEZ!"

"event","I was home sick yesterday with a cold and I was watching the Tyra Banks talk show.  On this episode, she put on a ""fat suit"" and did a few experiments on what it's like to be fat.  
1ST EXPERIMENT:   She goes into a fancy clothing boutique and starts browsing the racks.  
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:  Customers and employees of the store start snickering at her behind her back.
MY PROBLEM WITH THIS WHOLE EXPERIMENT:   Duh!  What the heck would a fat girl be doing in a fancy clothing boutique with clothes that won't fit her.  That was just a stupid experiment.  Why would I or any other fat girl go into a store that doesn't have clothes that would fit them.  I have no business being in a place like that.  

2ND EXPERIMENT:  She sets up 3 blind dates and meets these guys for dinner.  AS soon as she introduces herself and sits down, she comes off way to strong and asks a lot of questions that no one would ever ask as soon as they sit down with someone they don't even know yet.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:  After she confesses who she really is, all 3 guys confess that they would not have asked her out again because she was too fat.  And Tyra Banks goes on to say at the end of the show that she will never dicriminate against fat people again now that she knows what it feels like.
MY PROBLEM WITH THE WHOLE EXPERIMENT:  Maybe if she would have not come on so strong with these guys and just chilled out and acted like a normal person, perhaps one of these guys would have looked passed her weight and just enjoyed her company.    And lets try another experiment Tyra.  Why don't you go on a date with a fat guy?  My guess is that you wouldn't be interested in a fat guy.  So your comments on never discriminating against fat people is just a bunch of hogwash.

"event","I can especially relate to #6.  

WHEN GIRLS DRINK TOO MUCH
 
1. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHERE MY PURSE IS.

2. I BELIEVE THAT DANCING WITH MY ARMS OVERHEAD AND WIGGLING MY BUTT
WHILE YELLING ""WOO-HOO"" IS TRULY THE SEXIEST DANCE MOVE AROUND.

3. I'VE SUDDENLY DECIDED I WANT TO KICK SOMEONE'S ASS AND HONESTLY
BELIEVE I COULD DO IT TOO.

4. IN MY LAST TRIP TO PEE, I REALIZE I NOW LOOK MORE LIKE A HOMELESS
HOOKER THAN THE GODDESS I WAS JUST FOUR HOURS AGO.

5. I DROP MY 3:00 A.M. SUBMARINE SANDWICH ON THE FLOOR, PICK IT UP AND
CARRY ON EATING IT.

6. I START CRYING AND TELLING EVERYONE I SEE THAT I LOVE THEM SOOOOO
MUCH.

7. I GET EXTREMELY EXCITED AND JUMP UP AND DOWN EVERY TIME A NEW SONG
PLAYS BECAUSE ""OH MY GOD! I LOVE THIS SONG!""

8. I'VE FOUND A DEEPER/SPIRITUAL SIDE TO THE GEEK SITTING NEXT TO ME.

9. THE MAN I'M FLIRTING WITH USED TO BE MY 5TH GRADE TEACHER.

10. THE URGE TO TAKE OFF ARTICLES OF CLOTHING, STAND ON A TABLE AND 
SING
OR DANCE BECOMES STRANGELY OVERWHELMING.

11. MY EYES JUST DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO STAY OPEN ON THEIR OWN SO I KEEP
THEM HALF CLOSED AND THINK IT LOOKS EXOTICALLY SEXY.

12. I'VE SUDDENLY TAKEN UP SMOKING AND BECOME REALLY GOOD AT IT.

13. I YELL AT THE BARTENDER, WHO CHEATED ME BY GIVING ME LEMONADE, BUT
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE I CAN NO LONGER TASTE THE GIN.

14. I THINK I'M IN BED, BUT MY PILLOW FEELS STRANGELY LIKE THE KITCHEN
FLOOR

15. I START EVERY CONVERSATION WITH A BOOMING, ""DON'T TAKE THIS THE
WRONG WAY BUT...""

16. I FAIL TO NOTICE THAT THE TOILET LID'S DOWN WHEN I SIT ON IT.

17. MY HUGS BEGIN TO RESEMBLE WRESTLING TAKE-DOWN MOVES.

18. I'M TIRED SO I JUST SIT ON THE FLOOR (WHEREVER I HAPPEN TO BE
STANDING) AND TAKE A QUICK NAP.

19. I BEGIN LEAVING THE BUTTONS OPEN ON MY BUTTON FLY PANTS TO CUTDOWN
ON THE TIME I'M IN THE BATHROOM AWAY FROM MY DRINK.

20. I TAKE MY SHOES OFF BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S THEIR FAULT THAT I'M
HAVING PROBLEMS WALKING STRAIGHT."

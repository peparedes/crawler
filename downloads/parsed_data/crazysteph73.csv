I have too many games this week! I have 3 volleyball games and 2 football games! Well maybe we'll win against crestview if I change into my wind-suit during the 3rd quarter instead of Half-Time!!>:o That would have been a lot funnier if that had happened to someone besides me!!!!Why do all the funny things that happen that involve me have to do with guys! Oh God I just remembered the gay little 5th grade boys incident! I best stop writing."

"event","I just got back from my dad's. Life in West Virginia was just swell. I'd come back once in a while to see my cousins on the weekend when my dad had off. Coming back here for me sucked,its soo depressing in Lisbon!:(Life hasn't been going my way necessarily. I'm not trying to sound like I'm a huge drama queen like I got dumped or got in a fight with a friend or whatever. There's been a lot of really sucky family issues mainly including me and it just sucks. It's kinda getting to the point where I'm not sure I can take all the stuff happening at school and life at home. God knows there will be lots of drama at school! Now I realize who are my real friends,the people that have time to hear all these wonderful things (It's depressing enough I'm writing in this!) Maddy and Molli I love you guys! I'm soo lucky I have friends like you! The kind that are losers like me!!:)haha good times! Well I best be going I gotta babysit tomorrow morning to earn some dough!"

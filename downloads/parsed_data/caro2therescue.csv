"event","Okay well this weekend was pretty fun. Friday night I did absolutely nothing so that was extremely boring!

Saturday I woke up around 7:30 to go to an optional swim practice that was from 8-10. But it really wasn't optional for me, becuase my mother made me go. grrr. OH well. After I got home I inhaled some mcd's mcgriddle.. YUM. Then I went upstairs and got some clothes on so I could help my dad out in the yard. All I did was pretty much help pick up sticks. Which is not fun at all! But then my dad got bit by some weird looking bug that was prolly poisonus so he sent me inside. After a while he comes back in and says I need some more help. So I put my shoes back on and went outside to help. I swear I got bit by mosquitoes like 20 times! My legs were itching like crazy. Then I walked my dog stepped in an ant pile and started freaking out cuz they were biting me! So I came inside and took like a 3 hour nap. I enjoyed that very much. Then around 5 I took a shower and got ready for Frankies and then Ginny's for the night. Frankies was lots of fun. First it was just me, ryan, ginny, and tristan. But after one ride on the go carts Chris and Josh were there. So we rode around the go carts one more time. Then went inside and just sat and chilled. Then Sanchez showed up, which is really cool, and then Sean, even better. There were like 6 guys and 2 girls.. OH YEAH! lol. The guys ((no Ryan tho)) took Ginny's phone and took it apart... then split up in the game room and went crazy. Me and Ginny stole Ryan's truck but I felt bad so I didn't go that far. Then the game w/ ginny's phone got old so she got it back. Then everyone was bored and quiet. So me, Ginny, and Ryan go to Ginny's house and chilled there for a while. Ryan left around 10:30 and me and Ginny stayed up until like 2 or something.

Today was pretty good too! I woke up around 10 to see Ginny already wide awake and talking online. So she tells me to get on in the guest room. I stayed at her house until around 1:30 or something.. got home and had to run to the Atkinson's to feed there fish and cat. I came home and Ryan came over! YAY! Today is 1 month from when we first started going out.. so awsm I love you Ryan!! =D But yeah. He stayed over until like 4:45 and had to go home =( and now I'm here at the computer extremely bored! and I don't feel too great =( OH well!

Weekend was alright.. Sat. night and those few hours I was w/ Ryan were awsm! but yeah. Later Tards!

I figured that my hw was gonna take me forever! but finished all of it by 10. I had like a 20-30 min break for pizza and all that good stuff =)

"event","Ahh the joys of not having school b/c the school had no power was quite nice! I spent half of my day w/ the wonderful Ryan and Ginny.. that was fun! We watched ""The Girl Next Door"" that movie is pretty good!  The rest of the day was okay.. I worked a little on my project and took a nap. Then I went to swim practice and ummm found out some interesting information from Aaron about Richard. But yeah.. then after swim practice I ate dinner and started working on my project.. talked on the phone w/ Sanchez for a while and finished my project. But during that stage I started thinking about things that I'm not going to say cuz I don't want to world to know but I just wish I could be selfish!!! and get two of what I know I can't have =( but yeah.. later tards!

"event","WELL I survived Tropical Storm Gaston.. so glad everyone freaked out about this one.. even tho it did more damage than Hurrican Charlie.. I think that's weird... Power was out most of the day which sucked major ass! But once the power came back on I had to type up my paper for Sociology. Mine is 817 words.. YAY.. only had to be 400 *heh* ANYWAYZ! I tried to start on the mobile part of it but didn't get that far.. I talked to Ryan then Sanchez.. and I was ADD a LOT.. I think this ADD thing is really kicking in.. maybe I should go to the doctor.. NAAAWW! I don't care!! *lol*

"event","Today was sooo much fun! I woke up this morning and Keri, me, Ryan, and Mark all went to Frankies. Ryan came and picked me up and we got to Frankies a lil early lol so we went inside and I got some tokens.. then this guy that was working there gives Ryan a hand full of tokens.. then he gave me some! So we got a bunch of free tokens lol So we spent all our tokens... and he ((of course)) kicked my ass at a racing game.. but oh well! Then Keri and Mark finally got there at like 12:45!! I knew they would take forever.. oh well. But yeah Keri spent some money and she got a bunch of tickets. I only got like 5:30.. so I let Ryan pick out a stuffed animal for me *it was a lepord or something of that sort lol* Then I got 6 googly eyed rings =D

After that we went to the mall ((all 4 of us)) and it was pouring outside when we got there.. Mark dropped Keri off so she didn't get wet.. I didn't give a damn so me and Ryan had to RUN from the back of the parking lot to the food court.. OMG we got soo wet!! lol Then we went to Hot Topic.. I got like a million pins and a sticker.. we went to the Dollar store and Spencers... then to the Food Court.. and after we ate.. Keri and Mark had to leave cuz Keri had to work

So me and Ryan end up coming back to my house.. we watch the Bourne Idenity and then Vh1 *hehe* I'm guessing he stayed at my house for like 4 hours cuz he didn't leave until like 8:15 BUT IT""S ALL GOOD!

I had soo much fun today and I""m soo happy I got to spend the whole day with Ryan =)It was awsome!! but yeah I need to go to hw >=O what a bitch.. so later tards!!

"event","Hello! How are you? I hope you're doing GREAT cuz it's 10 til 10 and I""m extremely bored!!

Last few days in school haven't been that exciting. I only get to see my Ryan during lunch and after school =( quite depressing. Oh well... hopefully we will find a way to see each other more often =D The one thing that does suck about school is HW *gah* I mean for real don't they give us enough work DURING school? Why must we go home and do MORE work! okay that's the end of my story there. I've had to much hw for just being in Honors! I don't want a lot of hw I have swim practice from 5-7 every night which interferes w/ HW BIG TIME! oh well.

New chick on the team.. WOW IS SHE GOOD she's better than Reaghan. Nice to finally see someone ON THE TEAM be better than Reaghn. Tho I'm already jealous. I wish I was that good =( Quite depressing.. OH WELL! I guess I'll just have to work my asss off harder and harder. I tried doing that tonight but well IT WAS SO MUCH AND KIND OF HARD! I was dead after practice. I complained a lot to Jaeson and I'm sure he was getting annoyed at me but oh well.. NOTHING I CAN DO! I tried my hardest. But I still yet have to decide who to vote Captain.. my mom says I should go for it. I don't really want to. I don't know why cuz I could help a few ppl and I have a little team spirit lol.. Not a lot tho!

Okay to change subects... I was doing espanol hw tonight and well I didn't know the answers the questions cuz they were like AHH all about hispanic countries.. so I kept asking my mom stuff and she wasn't sure about one answer so I told her I'll just go w/ her instinct. Then my dad goes why don't you look it up and I was like well I can't.. no where to look it up! I never learned the stuff last year.. but there goes my dad ""You're an idiot"" and of course my mom yells at him tellin ghim I wasn't an idiot but it pissed me off! I hate when he does that.. he knows nothing of it.. HE NEVER HAD SPANISH! ugg it pissed me off I told him to shut up I've never told him that before but he pissed me off.. I could have said a few other things but I keep it PG rated around my parents.. I no cuss!

Well looks like I need to fill a sheet out for swim team, walk my dog and well since I'm so fucking bored I guess I'll go to bed =(

I had my first driving lesson today. It went really good. I did really good on parallel parking and 3point turn and all that stuff.. I just had trouble pulling into grass and then backing back up the same way I came in.. THAT WAS HARD! haha

After my lesson Keri and Mark call up and was like we're gonna go visit Richard at IronGate. so I'm okay w/e. So we go to IronGate pool and Mark and Keri end up leaving and going to Target. I hang out w/ Richard and the next person that was suppose to come after him never came. So I ended up going home w/ him cuz Keri and Mark went to O'Charlies so Keri could get her paycheck. So we hang out at his house and Keri and Mark come pick us up. SO BACK TO MY HOUSE IT WAS!

We didn't rent any movies so we watched Bring It On Again ((gay Mark wanted to see it! lol)) And after that movie was over we watched Pirates Of The Carribean. Somewhere during the movies my mom orders us pizza so we chow down ((yummmm!)) and let me just say during the night.. Mark saw some ""melons"" that he didn't want to see **lol Mark!.. you're awsm tho! sry for crushing you!! ;)**

We went to Khol's and I bought a belt.. well actually Mark gave me a discount so THANKS!!

We went back to BrandyMill to pick up Richard.. we drop him off at home and go to Bryan's to watch some home made video. It was pretty funny. We go back to Richard's and Keri wanted to go to Best Buy so she could buy the gay Avril Lavigne CD ((blah she made us listen to it!!!))

We end up going over to Keri's to find out we're gonna all go to my house HORAY! We go to BlockBuster and get Euro Trip. We get into the neighborhood and see Rachel D.! HORAY! So we stop by and she ends up stopping buy at my house. I still don't know if Euro Trip is any good or not cuz I really didn't watch it.. hehe hehe heh. 0=) but yeah. Everyone leaves my house at like 8:40 cuz Richard had to home at 9 ((haha curfew so fuckin early!!))

<P>Last night was fun!! I went to the Summerville Invitational even tho I wasn't swimming and had fun... I just hung out w/ bunch of people, saw some old friends! And I was also harrassed.. BUT WHATS NEW!! After the meet was over a few people from the team went to Sonics ((yummmy)) I was sad tho b/c they were out of bananas and I couldn't get me Banana Cream Pie Shake ((the best ever!!!)) but oh well</P>
<P>I came home and went to the Atkinsons ((the house I'm watching over while they are out of town)) but I couldn't find the key to get in.. and the cat wouldn't leave me alone!! she kept on purring and rubbing all up against me. So I went back home.. talked on the phone for a while and then went to sleep at like 12</P>
<P>I woke up at 6:30 to go to swim practice but I was like FUCK THIS! and went back to sleep. My mom wakes me up at 6:40 so I went ahead and got ready.. practice was a drag and kinda hard... but it was prolly only hard b/c I had no energy and I didn't even swim last night! so I felt sorry for all the people that swam all last night and came to practice this morning.</P>
<P>I came home from practice and Mrs. Kastenholz called and said that she didn't need me to babysit so I was happy.</P>
<P>But that's about it.. I'm going out to dinner at Tristans ((really expensive, nice, and yummy food.. so I've heard)) for my sister's 26th b-day ((wow she's getting old lol)) YAY! now I might be going w/ Melanie while she gets her haircut =)</P>

"event","I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time 
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!! NIKKI!!!!!!! oh...

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!NIKKI!!!!!!!!oh.....
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!COME BACK NIKKI!!!!!COME BAAAAAAAAACK!!!!!"

"event","Here's how my 4th of July weekend went:

*~*July 3*~*
Okay well.. saturday was a fun day I came home from swim practice ((Ginny made me go.. curse you ginny.. j/k I LOVE YOU!)) and then I when I got home I went to sleep.. I wake up at 12 to find everybody left to go to the pool w/o me.. so I was kinda pissed.. I call my mom and was like why didn't anyone wake me up.. she was like I tried I tried blah blah.. so I'm like whatev.. you didn't try hard enough.. My mom was then like well Stephanie will come pick you up in like 5 minutes.. so I go get ready and I'm freakin out cuz I can't find my brush or phone cuz they were in my Coosaw bag. I tried calling my phone but I didn't hear it.. Stephanie is outside honking the horn like crazy and I'm getting alittle pissed off cuz she can't be patient.. BITCH! So I go outside and tell her to go ahead and leave that I'll just walk up there cuz I couldn't find my phone.. she was like blah balh I'll wait for another 5 minutes.. I told her to go.. so I go inside... and start searching again for my phone.. I call my mom to see if she knew where it was and she's all like no I don't.. and you're ground cuz I just bought you a new bathing suit and you won't come to the pool.. so I hang up on her extremely pissed off. My sister comes in after like 10 minutes and screasm YOU ARE SO RUDE!.. I'm just omg.. BITCH!! so I go outside and she's like did you find  your phone.. I'm like yes but I'm not going cuz you just yelled at me out of the blue ((I'm extremely pissed off right now)) so I got inside.. close the door and lock it ((I lock the door naturally)) and she tries to come in and I'm just liek I'm not going. So she leaves.. and she leaves a message on my phone that was like ""I don't know who you think you are but if you ever lock me out of the house again I will come inside and beat you're little ass and you better give me the money I gave to you for watching Ella ((her dog)) or I will take all you're clothes and give them to good will"" after hearing that I""m in tears cuz I'm pissed of and I mean extremely pissed off.. I hate my sister right now and I will never forgive her for that. My mom calls me and is like The Atkinsons are hear and Evan wants to see you..so I""m like I will only go if you keep Stephanie away from me.. so she comes and picks me up and I hang out at the pool w/ Rachel L. Evan(( I played w/ her most of the time)) and then Ginny comes up. After the pool Ginny comes over w/ me and I shower and get ready to go to the mall. We pick up Rachel L. and go shopping.. YAY! I bought my bitchy ass sister at $25 gift certificate to charlotte rouse and I bought a few things at Hot Topic. So afterwards we all eat at Fazoli's ((YUUUUM))and I spend the night w/ Ginny

*~*July 4th*~*
Wake up and me and Ginny went and had breakfast at Waffle House w/ her parents ((yummm)) Then me and Ginny go pick up Ryan and come over to my house.. GInny ends up leaving cuz she couldn't stay and go to the River Dog's game =( so I call Rachel D., Rachel L. and Karina.. none of them can come.. so Sanchez calls me and I'm like will you come w/ my and Ryan and he's like yeah! so me and Ryan watch the secret window and then my mom brought us some Wendy's ((YUMMM)) Sanchez comes over and I made Ryan and Sanchez wait above the garage while I took a shower and got ready ((Ryan fell asleep and Sanchez was just lookin dead lol)) but we go to the game and have a blast.. I got my face painted ((hehe)) but after the game we come back shoot off some fireworks and then I take them all home..

It was quite a fun weekend except for my little pissy mood time but my dad is bitchin at me cuz it's late o.O so LATER TARDSS!!!

"event","Well I this may sound strange to say this to the world.. but whatev.. here it goes...

Okay well I'm online talking to Ginny, Sanchez, Ryan, and Rachel L. Ginny asks for Sanchez's sn so she can talk to him so I give it to him.. she asks him if he still likes me and he says yes.. Sanchez then asks if I still like him and I said this...""yes.. I do still like you.. but I don't really think it was as much as I did when we were dating"" and I then ask if he still likes me he says ""yes"".. so I'm just yeah whatev.. and I try to change the subject by singing a Simple Plan song I was litening to.. he then asks me out.. I was kind of shocked... and I said ""no"".. first time I ever said no to a guy.. but here's my reasoning...
""would go out w/ him again.. but just not at the moment.. I want to be single for a while.. enjoy it and all that.. I want to enjoy my summer.. and not have to spend a lot of time w/ one person.. I like to hang out w/ lots of people""

Sanchez.. if you do read this.. I just want to say.. that what I just said is the truth.. and well I just don't know what to say.. just don't think I don't like you.. cuz I do =)

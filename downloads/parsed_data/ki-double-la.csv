In the end, you know whos true, and it wasnt even the end yet. 

Fuck peoples shit man. I aint innocent but it aint all my fault.

<small>""We must learn to call a truce with ourselves in our war against fat."" 

How awesome is that sentence? I heard it this afternoon while flipping channels. I came across a show on Discovery Times called Understanding Obesity. I heard that sentence and stopped what I was doing. For me, it made perfect sense. 

We all know that society says that in order to be considered attractive, you should be thin. WRONG!! Everyone is different. There are plenty of thin women that wouldn't look right as larger sized women. There are also plenty of larger sized women that just wouldn't look right thin. 

Everyone's bodies are different. Some were meant to be larger than others. DIVERSITY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE!! It's what makes the world go 'round. I've maintained my weight of 260 for many years now. I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be. I still remain fairly active (I've always been more of a bookworm) and can do things without getting winded too easily. Maybe this is the weight that my body has decided is right for me. 

Maybe the woman that is 5'11"" and weighs a SEXY 420lbs IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT SIZE!! For whatever reason, genetics have determined that that is the best size for her. So long ofcourse as she feels healthy. THAT IS THE KEY!! 

YOU MUST FEEL HEALTHY IN YOUR OWN BODY!! When you feel as if you can't do things anymore because of your size, then lose weight. If you can't walk to the kitchen without getting winded, then lose weight!! BUT, that doesn't mean that you have to go down to a size 6!! Lose weight until you feel healthy again. No where does it state that in order to be HEALTHY, you have to be a twig. Healthy for me is going to be different than healthy for you. 

Ladies, you must also understand something. Being considered attractive doesn't always have anything to do with a persons size. For me, and a lot of my friends, it's about the attitude. If you carry yourself in a certain manner, you will get noticed! There is nothing sexier than a large woman who knows she's hot. Her confidence totally wins me over. 

Men and women alike have to realize when enough is enough. If diets aren't working for you, then maybe it's because your body is happy where it's at. You just have to get accustomed to that. That is the hardest part. Being able to say to yourself, as well as others, I'M HAPPY THE WAY I AM!! </small>

There are a lot of Big Beautiful Women out there and I think I can fit into that category. Dont you?"

</3 This years almost over. 2004 is here. Yeah...just another fucking year. This year brought me NO new friends. Hell it even helped me loose 'friends'. Rich, Sara, Sarah, most LJ 'friends', Rick, and many more. It helped me find myself, I suppose. I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing.

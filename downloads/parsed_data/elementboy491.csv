"event","Hey this is brandon and i am tryin out this journal thing to see if i like it well i guess i am supposse to tell about my day so i will start with that.
Well the day started out in math we pretty much did nothing all we did was home work in class so it was pretty gay. The second part of the day was pretty cool (suprisingly) or how ever u spell it. We were in science class and we did a lab we made goo stuff i had to help angela and alicia because they didnt no how to do it (lol). The third part of my day was gym we played volleyball and i really suck at it. The 4th part of my day i went to computers i hate computers soooo much we have to do a gay project.Then the 5th part of my day was horrible i went to s.s and mrs campbell like hates me i got yelled at like 5 times for standin on the desk and stuff. O ya lets not forget i had to go down to the office today because of gay james who humps dogs and i am dead serious about that. ya hes pretty gay.

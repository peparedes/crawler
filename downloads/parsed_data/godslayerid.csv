its like it rained instead of snowed..so I didn`t get to play at all..but what is worse is that I drive one of the worst things to be driving in ""bad"" weather and most ppl drive frontwheel drive cars and 4 wheel drive suvs and stuff like that..but I have no problems in this weather but some one driving a 4 wheel drive suv mannages to drive straight into a telephone pole and snap it in half...

"event","weee,as if you didn`t know it kinda snowed last night and altho every one eles is complaining and bitching about it*looks at ang*..I`m about to go take Cathrine for a ride and have some fun..
yes,its play time..can`t say this is my favorite time of year but being in a 1 and a half ton dualie pick up doing donuts and just randomly skidding out has got to be one of the funnest things out there..its not realy the skidding its more the rush you get from being just this side of out of control..when your at the point of""ok,if I give it just a little more gas I will loose all control...GO FOR IT!""
I know I complain alot about my job always trying to kill me but this is different..its not the job it me having fun..I know..I`m strange that way..acualy tho I`d like to go get the peterbuilt or maybe even the autocar from work..omg..now that would be fun..think of the dammage I could do swinging a 40 foot trailer behind me..it would have kinda a whip effect to it..or even just leave the trailer in the yard..oh the spin outs I could do..
altho I would probably end up breaking the transmissions in both of them..they both prety weak and probably couldn`t take me jamming them in gears for verry long..but it would be fun while it lasted..
see you guys later..or on the 6 o`clock new..MWHAHAHAHAHAHA"

"event","so ok like the ford trying to kill me wasn`t bad enough..
no atempts on my life today just a randon course of events that led to things being broken and me being a nervous wreck by the end of the day..
since my boss refuses to hire any one eles that can use our low bed trailer to move the machines with I have to do it..all was fine and dandy till I picked up the first machine..thats when the idiots came out of the wood work..
so,I`m at a light waiting to make a right hand turn to get on the highway..while to my left is another truck waitting to take a left off the highway..the light turn so I start to turn right and make a wide swing cause with that trailer I`m like 50 feet long..and the ass in the other truck decides he wants to go right not left in a left turn only lane..so he comes right at me..never hit the brake never even tryes to slow down..I end up cutting my corner short to avoid hitting him and hit instead the curb and fence on the corner..luckly no dammage so I kept going..but still..what an ass..
so,I get on I-195 west to get to 95 south..and no problems till I try to merge onto 95..ppl keep sitting right next to me even tho I know that dirrectional is flashing in thier faces..so about 1 mile befor my exit I start easing over..when you see some thing that big start coming at you...you move..I don`t care who you are..call me an ass if you like but if you were paying attention instead of talking on your cell you wouldn`t have this problem now would you?
so,I get off the exit and get to whithin 1 mile of the job and anouther ass comes flying out of a side street infront of a bus picking ppl up..so I slam on my breaks thinking I am sooo gonna T-bone this guy..to my surprise the truck stops..the machine on the other hand does not stop..it broke through all 4 chains and came flying at the cab of the truck...now I know I`m not gonna get hit by it cause it would have to fly about 15 feet in the air to even get close to me and I don`t know about you but I`ve never seen a 60 ton front end loader fly if it wasn`t in a cargo plane..so,it hits the front of the trailer and bunces up and unto the front of it..so now I`m thinking ""oh great..its gonna fall off the trailer and flip over onto the street..but to my surprise again it stays on the trailer..so here I am running the rest of the way to the jobsite in 2nd gear praying the dammed thing doesn`t fall..
I made it and we get it off with the escavator but I gotta tell you..I was scared..
so..maybe I should just spend the rest of the week in my room..
so any way..I`m off to bed befor any thing eles can happen today..on an upsidfe I Lunaticgrey poped her head up today to let me know she was alive so I`m happy..
good night all"

the ABS breaks decided they were gonna cut off the breaks for no reason...
have I ever mentioned that I HATE fords?
any way,besides that,I got Halo 2 today..not bad..don`t realy like fps games but I played the first one so I had to get this one,so far I like the story but it leaves you to find your own way around in the areas..like no directions..I hate that..
trying to take a break from the on line games for a week..need a reality check..on that note,I noticed a online and RL friend of mine missing in action a few days ago...I never see her on any more and she hasn`t been at work the last few times I`ve gone to look and her LJ has been dead a few weeks..
so if any one knows lunaticgrey and knows where she is let me know please..other wise I have to hunter her down and I don`t like doing that any more..
oh well,I need to move a few machines early in the morning so I`m off to bed

"event","ok,so I`m back from my night out and it turns out we didn`t do mutch..
but I think I`m either going crazy or I`m just noticing things(namly girls)more..
I usualy pick up ginna from work at 6:30 on sunday since Gabe works in mass..so there I am sitting in the parking lot just looking around and listening to some tunes when this cute girl walk outa the mall...
and ofcourse she catches me glancing at her..and to my surprise she seems to be glancing at me..either I`m delutional in thinking that or she was just wondering if I was some kinda nut..but then she gets in her car and drives right in front of me and we had eye contact the whole way..to me..thats strange..
again..she probably thought I was some kinda nut now that I think about it..
ok,so ginna and I get to her and gabes place and wait for the others to show up..after we all gathered we decide to go to chilies for dinner..not my favorite place but oh well..
any way,our server..and I can`t even remember her name(and I`m usualy good with names of girls like her)
is dressed in jeans and nice tight shirt with devil ear and yes..a tail..and what a nice tail it was..
I mean the it had the spaded end and all..plus the ""tail"" it was attached to was nice too..
but any way,ofcourse my friends notice that I`m staring at said tail..so I have to say some thing to her..
so,I ask her if she has gotten any comments about her costume tonight..she said she has had all 60+ customers all night..then looks at me not in a bad way but kinda..I don`t know..with a playfull(?) look and asked if I had a comment about it..I must have turned bright red cause I didn`t want to say any thing..I am a little shy with ppl I don`t know I think..so I said no..and then..Ginna of all ppl says ""nothing he wants to say out loud anyway.""
oh man..she kinda giggled and went to get our deserts..and I again noticed she was ""shaking"" her tail just a little more then befor when she was walking away..
now at this point I wanted to talk to her and I had a few chances but then..that voice in the back of my head started...
you know..the run silent run deap voice..
so I chickened out once again..
so once again I`m am defeated by my own fears..
I realy have this complex about dateing now..gee,I wonder why
I guess if I am to ever ""fall in love"" again its gonna have to be with a friend or some one I`ve known for a while..
well,thats my pathetic night..and now bed cause I have work early in the morning..
night all 2 ppl that might acualy read this.."

eh,any way..spent the day at home watching the dvds I got yesterday and playing FFXI.
so,now I`m getting ready to go out for the night..Gabe,Ginna,Shawn,and I are probably gonna play xmen legends all night..that game so rocks..but its long and hard in some areas..
gonna be starting 3 jobs sites at work tomorrow..that should be fun..
I`m still wondering how he expects me to run 3 machines in 3 different places at the same time..
this should be interesting..
so any way..the days seemed so short..the night is gonna be shorter..and the work week is gonna seem like forever and a day...why is that?

"event","Hi again to those few ppl that know I exist...
my bitch today is about family and bestbuy..
my sister got caught beeting on her youngest kid..so here comes the cops to my door once again..
but believe it or now I`m not even slightly mad about that..she will get whats coming to her whether I get involved or not so..my thing today is bestbuy..
I went there today to get a mp3 program and some anime..
those that know me know I am a big gundam fan,soo,I wanted the 2 new volumes of gundam seed..
they didn`t have them..and when asked about it the sales person said they didn`t even order them so they wouldn`t be getting them in..so then I`m looking around the anime section when she tells me this and I see a new release that I downloaded the first ep of..and guess what?..its hentai..yes porn on the best buy shelves..and not even one parental warning sticker..
so,I bring this to the manager..""you don`t order mainstreem anime but you put porn on your shelves?""
he was..a tad shocked to say the least..even offered to order the gundam dvds for me..I told him not to bother..I`d find them eleswhere..
so..any one have any thoughts?..thats pretty screwed up don`t you think?..
so,any way...I go looking for my anime other places..I hate fyi..for those of you who know of this place its realy over priced..but when you can`t get them anywhere eles what are you supost to do?
I also went to a place called newbury comix..the closest thing that has anime resonably priced..they didn`t have the gundam dvds but they did have a show I used to watch called galaxy rangers on 2 DVDs..oh yea.. I snatched them quick..
so..thats been my day,ended up getting dvds I didn`t know existed for cheep and 2 dvds I wanted for over price...
now to go watch them..

any way...part of the passing out was my own damn fault...who knew you wern`t supost to mix nyquil od dayquil with caffine?...turns out that mix has a tendancie to knock your dumb ass out...any way...after the medics show up and poke me..they test the site and kick every one off it...turns out the escavator I was on was right on top of one of those storage tanks I just told you about...go figure...just my luck...so,after a short(6 hours)stay in the emergency room at an unknown hospital...the doc comes to us and says ""I`ve got some meds that SHOULD counter act the poisons in you blood stream""...(you mean you don`t know?)

one of those days...
I woke up this morning and decided to watch a little shoalin soccer action...
they game me the WRONG FUCKIN DVD!!!!!
it was chicago one the disk instead...I mean its obviose that these are ""backed up copys"" of the hong kong DVDs but come on ppl..at least get the right DVD in the right case...
so it was back to sarges with my not so happy ass this morning to get the right DVD but not befor checking battle royal to make sure it was right...it was
so I get there and get the right DVD and staring me in the face is a FF-X DVD...so of course I had to buy that too...
so I come back and just to wast time I go to th RI mall to see Gina at EB..
only to find out they are really talking about knocking that mall down...not news to me..I`ve been hearing about it for months now but with no paper work to conferm it...
so its off to work I go to see what the hell is going on and low and behold sitting on my desk is the demo proposal...complete with an app to use explosives...not that I mind blowing the damn place up but they said they wanted to keep some of the stores intact...
I can`t do that...they want to keep stuff and ID+TNT=nothing left.....
dumb ass...so it off to slap the boss up side the head and ask what the hell is he thinking...
after about an hour of shouting and then a taking a ride to the mall so I can show him whatI`m talking about he finaly sees my point...dumb ass again..
so with that done I come home to play PSO just for my father to meet me AT THE DOOR(I hate that)and tell me I have to go get some meds for him at CVS...
so then I get home to find that a few ppl have replyed to yesterdays posting of mine...
so I guess I must say sorry to those I`ve offended but there is no need to get hostile are nasty or you just get it back...
whitch leads me to my next question..why is it every time I try to be nice I get the shit end of the stick?
I mean realy..I go out of my way to be nice and NOT cause trouble and I get bitched at and insulted...
should I just be an ass next time and start more trouble and get a buncha ppl in trouble with me?
I can..its not hard...hell if I`m lucky maybe I can even get us all arrested...wouldn`t that be fun?
look,I`m not trying rehash any thing or throw any thing in you fase so I`ll make a deal with you..I`ll stay in my world you stay in yours....
oh and by the way ""happily married one""...we didn`t start the trouble last week end..you did...we were pefectly willing to just go to the con have a good time and come home with out any trouble...you were the one that opened your mouth to ang...
so there it is folks...fit hits the shan and I didnt throw it for once...
but I fully expect to get bitched at and insulted more for this post...
oh well...again..try to be nice and get the shit end of the stick...
well..time to let out some agrivation..PSO time...

tuesday:
wake up and do all the fun stuff you do in the morning...
decided to watch some of the anime I bought/won at the con..I started with macross zero cause I had seen dragon half already...to my surprise what I realy bought wasn`t macross zero but a 90 min commertial about all the different macross shows..and only about 10 min of it was sub titled...that pissed my off so mutch I went right to PSO...
I created an online girlfriend for ID(wish I could create an offline girlfriend for myself that easily...)
played till midnight..end of day..
wendsday:
agian..morning crap...go to bank..go to EB..why do I keep buying games I`m not gonna play????
went to ang`s plce picked up her brother and we went to ""sarges""..its a little anime plus store in conneticut...bought shaolin soccer and battle royale..whitch pisses me off just a little cause I went to the dealers room and the florida oriental trading post just to find both of them and all I had to do was take a quick trip to conn.?!?!?!?!
then I got my arm twisted into eating with ang`s family..witch is nice,the food is great.
so now I`m here typing this and PSO is calling to me...
but one more thing...why the hell did they release the vidoe game for ""the Hulk"" almost a full month befor the movie?
does that make any sence ppl?
some one was smoking just a little too mutch I think...
ok,PSO time...

"event","ok,its like 11 0`clock here so I`m gonna try to keep this short since ang has done all the big stuff
just a few things I`d like to point out and say about this week end
first of all I must say ""I`m sorry to all those that I should have spent more time with this last week end...I feel like sutch an ass for not making more of an effort to be around more with the ppl from TBA..
and for those of you wondering..no,it wasn`t cause I was spending too mutch time finding ways to get into trouble..
I didn`t even try to tourcher Rain..altho I think just my being there was enough to get her goat..
any way,I realy apreitiate all the ppl from TBA that helped me out this week end aspeicaly Jen for letting me ""crash"" at her place thursday night....
I`m sorry I didn`t make the time to get to know her or any of the new members better..
I guess I was acualy hoping for a chance to talk to my ""X"" so I did`t think about making time for any thing eles...I need to take some ones advice and get over it I guess...
ok,away from my shame and self loathing for a moment and to the con.
I had a good time seeing old friends and meeting new ones for the whole week end but the con itself left me wanting more...not that its the cons fault or any thing..all the anime they were showing this year is all new stuff from the curent seson over in japan so whats my problem with it you ask?..well...with the new contacts to get new anime that I have found I have all the new shows on my hard drive allready so I`ve seen them all...and didn`t wish to spoil it for those that havn`t seen them...I don`t wann see the look on some ones fase when I tell them that theire fav Gundam seed char getts killed in the 29th ep.
the secound problem was the dealers room..verry little new stuff...but again..not there fault...with the strike going on out west and SARS in hong kong..well,there just isn`t a lot of new stuff being let into the country..so I guess I`ll just have to suffer on till some one admits to my theiry on whats going on...(better shot of getting me to quit PSO)
lets see..what eles..oh yes..those nasty cosplayers...no I don`t mean all of them...I mean the 150pound lulu,and the half nakid yuna,and the overly ""perky"" riku...
some ppl should just not cosplay...
ok,now to the confusing part of my week end...I was nice and on saterday I gave Rain(my ""X"" for those who don`t know)back some pictures I still had of hers...I still have her camera but thats a wholy nuther story..any way,I walked up to her as she was getting ready to leave saterday and politly tapped her on the shoulder and said ""befor you leave here,these are yours""..to whitch she said""thank you"" and I walk away...end of story?..nope...
sunday she and vikki(her ""girlfriend"")are there and have a booth at the con and run a pannel at the con....after they pack up and go down stairs a random cat girl walks up to me and gives me a pair of cat ears...says she thinks I should have these and runs off...now by this point I`m confused..any way..later I find out that Rain,besides making plushies,also makes cat ears just like the ones I was given...now,I`m wondering...did the cat girl buy them and give them to me or did I just recieve stolen property?...I guess since its probably best that I not contact Rain I will never know..but I`ll hold on to them for a while...maybe its some thing eles alltogether...I don`t know..I`m still confused...
lets see..what eles...
well...since ang already covered the traveling feasco I geuss I can shut up now...
gonna go see what trouble I can cause in other ppls LJs now

"event","ok..last night I stayed up till 2 o`clock in the morning playing my new favorite game...whitch is in my mind an extention of my other favorite game...since I made my char in Phantasy Star Online(pso) into my favorite char from my other fav game called Xenogears...ID...whitch by the way is a lvl 121 hunter.
any way..at 6 o`clock this morning the phone rings and its my bosses wife who has the most ear piercing voice I have ever heard...I`d rather spend 2 days with that woman from the nanny then talk to her for 5 min.
and they want me to work today cause a building colapsed last week end and they want me to help clean it up.
I hate cleaning up a mess that I didn`t get to make...if I can`t blow it up I don`t wann clean it up...so needless to say I`m tired and won`t realy get to play pso for the next week cause I`m going to FL for a con on thursday and won`t see my X-box for about 4 or 5 days...damn it...cyclo is gonna catch up to me....so thats my day and a little back story for you..."

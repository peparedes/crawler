Booo summer school starts in 3 weeks, that's way too soon for me.

I'm still looking for a job...I've applied for anything through Snider-Blake specifically Precise Tech. I went up to Aurora Farms on Tuesday with Kristin, Alexis, and Philip to look for a job, I applied at Mikasa, New England Homes, Welcome Home, and Totes...still waiting to hear back from them. I really need money, I have to pay for my car, insurance, and my crazy ass high cell phone bill this month, plus all kinds of other misc. stuff.

We've come up with this crazy new obsession...4 Sqaure. Remember when back in the day during recess you played 4 Square, well we've brought it back and improved it. Its soooo fun, YOU should come play with us!

Last weekend I got to see my cousin's baby. She is sooo adorable! I also got paid for watching the dog while they were having the baby.

Monday afternoon Kristin came by and surprised me. I had no idea she was home. I haven't seen here in forever. I guess she is in the process of moving back up here. Yay! I really miss last summer with her, we had some goodtimes. I hope we can make some more awesome memories this summer.

Tuesday I got my license back, but that's not all I got...I got a car too! I bought a 1999 green Plymouth Neon. I've got it all decked out with fun stuff already, thanks to Alexis hehe. I'm so happy.

I'm still waiting for a call for work. They were suppose to call me this week but haven't. I'll have to call on Monday. It's gonna be really interesting going back to work....hmmmm.

Not much else is going on. I'm just glad that my life is starting to get better.

"event","This afternoon Penny was outside barking so I went out there to see what was going on. When I got outside, I found her chasing a deer into the woods which she does alot. So I grabbed her to take her into the house before a fight broke out, as I was pulling her I looked back at the deer to make sure he didn't run though the woods and on to Rt.91 and get hit by a car...instead, the deer was running back towards us, which was kinda unusual because they don't usually make any contact with people. Luckily I got into the house before it attacked us. A little while later I noticed that Penny was bleeding from her lip, leg, and front paw. I guess she did get into a fight with the deer before I got outside. I cleaned up all her boo boos like a good vet haha!

A few hours later I heard Penny outside barking again. I went outside and she was barking at this big bush in the corner of our yard. Behind it was a baby deer that had to have been born today, it could barely stand up or walk and it was shaking. My mom sat next to it and tried to feed it, but it was too scared from Penny barking at it. I ran and got my camera, I got some close ups and adorable pics of the newborn before it wandered off to find it's mother. It was sooo cute, it kinda looked like a mini kangaroo, hahaha!!

I guess the mom wasn't really trying to attack us, it was just trying to keep us away from her new baby.
Atleast I get to make fun of Penny for getting her ass kicked by Bambi's mom! lmao!

Quite an eventful day.
It's sleeepytime.

My grandma is in the hospital with pneumonia...but i think she's gonna be alright.

I'm feeling a little relieved. I got alot of my ""To Do List"" done, just 2 more big things left and then I'm set. What's left is gonna be a bit of a challenge, but I have nothing better to do so I might as well challenge myself a bit.

I finally got all of my grades, 2.5 for the semester and 2.3 cumm...I'm staying at KSU! Woot!

Paid my tuition today for my summer class, I'm out $792. Geez, college is soooo over priced, I'm so in debt.

Being at home is boring as hell, I wish I was at school or working. I gotta get out of the house. I feel like an animal not doing anything.

I don't really have alot else to talk about... 

I'm out, probably off to play some more Mario Kart even though that's all I've been doing the past 3 days straight...someone save me please!

"event","Hi! Hi!

This past weekend I went home to do some stuff. Friday night my mom and I went to Coldstone Creamery, that was yummy, and we rented 2 movies, 'Closer' and 'Open Water'. Closer really really sucked, there wasn't much of a plot. I'm not sure how it won two awards. Open Water was good, but the ending was kinda unclear. 

Then, saturday we went to my cousin's baby shower, always a fun time. Saturday night, my cousin Kevin came up to spend the night up here to see what college life is like. It was really boring because the campus was dead, I have no clue where everybody went but nobody was around. So we just walked around campus and chilled in my room. Sorry it sucked, hopefully next time stuff will be going on and there will be people around.

Next weekend, Candace is coming up here for Lil' Sibs weekend, that should be an interesting time. Hmmm...somebody save me!

I got my income tax returns...$500, Hell Yeah!!

"event","Ohio weather really sucks. It shouldn't be raining/sleeting/snowing over spring break. Next week it's suppose to be 60 degrees, why not this week when it's spring break?? Damn you Ohio.

It's nice to be away from my family...across the street, I guess you could call that ""away."" Geez, then my little sister shows up to bother me...yeah so much for getting away from her. It's kinda pretty boring living in my neighbor's house. It's really hard to get comfortable and find something to do in someone else's house...even though we are like family, it's just weird. I've been playing with their pets, studying for my business test, and watching TV, and just sitting around ponder what I should do to entertain the situation. It's funny how you can have 900 channel and yet still there's nothing to watch, that would be why I hate TV. Craziness...

So I recently became extremely obsessed with Gilmore Girls. I used to see clips of it or whatnot and think that it was a stupid show, so I don't understand my new obsession at all...but I'm addicted!! I love the fast paced and witty conversations they have...but seriously, what 32 yr old mom and 16 yr old daughter talk like that?? I see the mom talking with a big vocab, but not the 16 yr old. I don't think I could ever have such a sophisticated conversation like they do, even if I tried. I need a dictionary with me when I watch it. Ohhh but I really love the show now...so I have to catch up on 5 seasons, since I decided to just tune in, hahaa! I've got quite a few of the episode under my belt already, so I'm making progress. Silly silly me!

This week I got back into watching Days of Our Lives. It's interesting how some of the story lines seem to be in the same place they were when I stopped watching in August. Then, there's others that changed so much that I don't even know who the characters are or what on earth is going on. Geez,I'm finally figuring things out after watching it the past 4 days, but when I get back to school I probably won't watch it, and I'll have to get back on track in May.

That new show ""The Office"" premiered tonight....funny stuff, it's just like Office Space but 10x better. It's really slow humor, but good. I wonder how it will progress, only so much can happen in an office. OK, enough with TV, cause it sucks! :) Sorry my whole entry turned into TV stuff.

Well that's all for now...
Happy Easter to everyone since I probably won't be able to update for awhile, since my internet at school doesn't work.
Bye for now!"

Good ol' Hudson'ville' is falling apart...drunk bus driver, student protesting to save our HS principal, according to the media it was a ""RIOT"" (riiight), and rumors of violence at school causing 1400 of 1800 students to stay home from school because rumor was students were planning on ""hurting themselves or others."" WOW! 3 weeks of hell...talk about a great community and school district gone wild. It's rather funny how one news reporter described Hudson, ""Quaint shops, polite people, and time passes without a hitch...that's the norm here in Hudson, not (a riot)"" I love how they made it sound like fairy tale land, LMAO! HHS students: don't give up fighting for Howard. We DON'T need a new principal, but we DO need a new superintendent. Check our these sites www.weloverogerhoward.com and www.recalltheboard.org.

Also, the next person that I see spell princiPAL wrong on the message board is going to die. That's really sad that you guys are in high school and keep spelling principal(the person), like ""pinciPLE""!

So I'm on spring break now. I have absolutely no plans...I'm house/dogs/cats/stuff sitting for Ash! I get to live at their house for a week and entertain their pets, hahaha fun stuff! :D I'm also gonna be study for my Business exam that I have right when I get back from break. Grrr!

I'm so angry right now, I could seriously put my fist through a wall. I signed up for my remedial class, it was suppose to be 9am till 5pm today...but the instructor never showed up...drove all the way out there for nothing. Those people are gonna get a really pissy phone call from me on Monday morning! I'm glad I'm not them when I get done with them.

"event","Thursday night Alexis came out here to Kent to chill. We hung out in the dorm, drank Jager and watched Napoleon Dynamite. We weren't happy with the buzz we got so Britt, Alexis, Tristan, and I went to DX for a while. We met this really creepy guy who came up to Britt and kept asking her all kinds of questions. He said that he was from Akron and stuff. He was all alone standing in the corner staring at us, and following us around, it was really scary. Who comes out to a Kent party all alone from Akron?? Seriously, who does that?? Britt stayed at the party with Paul, so the rest of us staggered our way back to the dorm. I made my drunken dials while trying not to wet my pants on the walk back. I made some drunken visits around the dorm, then we went to Rosie's to meet up with Moose and Dave...apparently before we left I made some shocking confessions. I don't remember any of it, oops sorry. Alexis and I got back from our rendevous with Moose and company, watched Dirty Dancing and crashed around 5am. Overall, it was a pretty weird night, everybody was really moody...it was odd. There was something weird about it that we couldn't figure out. Atleast I got drunk!!

Friday we woke up around 9:30 when we heard Britt getting ready for class. OMG, I couldn't even function, it was like a zombie/ out of body experience. Finally around 11 Alexis and I physically woke up. She came to sociology with me...blah, I couldn't even follow what my teacher was saying. The overhead wouldn't work so we got let out 30 min early. We then caught the bus to the stadium to pick up Alexis's car, omg the bus was so packed, I've never seen so many people before. There were 4 people on the bus from Hudson, the bratty little freshman. Alexis went home and I went back to sleep..yay!

Saturday night Britt and I went to watch Pat, Paul, Jenna, and Jeanette at Songfest for their Frats/ Sors. It was pretty cool seeing their dances and songs. It lasted 3 1/2 hrs and it was soooo hot in the balcony, we were dying and getting irritated. The stupid girl giving away the raffle ticket prizes kept saying that everything was ""fun"". Geez... ""well this is a FUN little prize"" and ""that's FUN"" and ""hope you have FUN"" FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN.... God, we were about to strangle her, ditzy brat. There were a bunch of parties afterward but I decided to stay in cuz I was still recovering from Thursday.

Yesterday was Kristin's 20th B-day!! Happy Birthday! Hope you're having an awesome time down in NC. 

Blah blah blah... I have a Child Psych to get ready for tomorrow and an Art History test on thurs...boooo for school

Bye!"

"event","Ok ok ok, I'm updating due to people whining (not to mention any names, Britt), I haven't updated because nothing has happened that's worth writing about. So, now I'm gonna try and find current events in my life to entertain you with....hmmmm....

So I've been trying to hang out with Moose but he seems to be really busy or something...or just doesn't like me:( I don't know what the deal is there. I like him, he's cute, nice, sweet! I'm sick of asshole guys, I don't think he could be an asshole even if he tried. Hopefully we can hang out again, we'll see what happens!

Classes are going alright, I've had tests the last few weeks. Art History- C, Soc- B, and Business- C. The past few days I've been studying my ass off for my Child Psych test that was suppose to be today, but when I got to class I found out that she moved it to next week...damn, I was all ready and pumped to take it, oh well looks like I can prep some more.

Last Friday Alexis and I went to lunch at Chipotle. Kristin was home from C-bus so she came with us and brought Bryan too. I love that kid, he's soooooo funny, it's always a fun time with him!! :) It was so awesome getting to see my favorite peeps. Good times, love ya guys so much! Kristin...I'm gonna try and come visit you over spring break, and if I don't, you know why.

I went to the doctor for the cheese that was growing on my tonsil, it ended up being nothing. Well it was something, but nothing to be concerned about and couldn't be cured with meds...I'm glad I paid $20 for him to tell me it was nothing. Anyway, it went away by itself a few days after. Haha it was really gross!

I bought a mini iPod. Oh its fun to play with! :) I was just gonna get an mp3 player but got talked into getting the iPod since it's better and of course more expensive. You should get one, I highly recommend it!

Ok well I'm out...leave some sugar!

P.S. What did you think of my previous entry? 
Britt...it's about Bob, You should have known that."

"event","Days and months have past since you walked away leaving me all alone
I know that you aren't coming back, still I sit here hoping and waiting
I walk around wearing this fake smile, pretending I don't miss you, when inside it's tearing me apart
I wonder where you are and how you're doing, even though I shouldn't care
And I wonder if you ever think about me
If only I had told you how I felt and showed you how much I loved you
If only you kept your promises and not let me down
If only...
You might still be here today
You said that you had to leave because you didn't want to hurt me
But you hurt me anyway, because goodbye hurt more than anything
You said that we would stay friends, but we haven't spoken since
Now I have nothing left but memories of us
Every night I walk out to where we used to watch the stars, wishing on a star that you'll come back to me
I can't get you out of my mind, no matter how hard I try, I just can't stop thinking about you
I miss your smile...
I miss your laugh...
I miss your pretty blue eyes...
I miss your sweet kisses and warm hugs...
I miss your scent...
I miss talking to you...
I miss everything about you...
But what I miss most is being your friend...
I may have learned how to live without you, but I still miss you more everyday!


*I miss you* :("

"event","Hey hey!
Oh yay for Valentine's day...actually no! I really hate Valentine's Day, I never have a valentine and being single sucks. When we were little Valentine's was so fun, we'd make valentines for our friends and people in our class and it was just a big old party. But now, it's just sad and it makes you realize you are all alone. Anyway, for V-day Moose and I had nothing to do, so we watched movies and hung out...that was my HOT date! HEHE!

I bombed my Child Psych test last week that I stayed up all night studying for...I got a D, I was 1 point away from a C. It's ok though, it was the first test, atleast I know whats to come on the next tests.

Yesterday I had an Art History test...a.k.a the test from hell, but I think at worst I'll get a C, I hope! We'll see tomorrow! The weather yesterday was gorgeous, ya gotta love it when it's the middle of Feb and 60 degrees and sunny out. Then, you wake up the next morning to 30 degrees and an inch of snow. Boy do I love OHIO!

I have a Soc test on Friday, I don't think it's going to be that bad. Today in class we reviewed for the test, and our crazy, red complementing, Croatian, prostitute-like professor gave us all the questions and answers that will be on the test. Who does that? Those silly foreigners, gotta luv 'em! A+ here I come, thanks!

People are really annoying and immature. I honestly hate people in general...I know I sound like a horrible person, but it's true. Sorry! But I love my friends, thanks for putting up with me guys!

Well I'm off to see the______! (use your imagination, insert something funny) Hehe!

Peace out homies!"

"event","Happy Thursday...was gonna go out and party it up tonight but I don't think that's happening.

I pulled an all nighter last night studying for my child psych test and I still think I bombed it. So much for all the studying I did. Atleast I got to chill with Kesha all night and then we went to Rosies to get breakfast at 6am, just like old times! I slept maybe 5 hrs today, but I'm still exhausted I won't make it through the night if I go out to D-Chi.

The sore throat that I've had the past couple of days has now turned into laryngitis...just great! I can talk just a teeny bit, but it feels like someone is ripping my throat open when I do.

Tomorrow I'm going home for the weekend, having a little family get together at my g'parents nursing home. Good times!

I'm out...like a ""whispering"" pine

Later

Thursday night Tristan, Britt, Paul and I went to Delta Chi. It was sooo much fun, I got totally shit faced...it's been awhile. Britt left early though because she didn't feel well. We all had an awesome time, ran into a bunch of people that I haven't see in awhile...good times. While we were there Tristan found out that one of his residents was killed in a car accident earlier that night along with 2 other students from KSU...it was really sad :( Anyway, it was a good night and I'm really glad I decided to go out, since I never go out. Thanks for everything Paul! :D

Saturday morning I went home for the day to build a bookcase for my sister because my mom insisted it get done  and it couldn't wait till next weekend when I was planning on coming home. It was a blast, ahhhh it took me almost 3 hours. Came back that night did my stupid business stock project and then watched Collateral with Britt, Paul, and Tristan.

Today I went with Britt to the mall so she could buy a dress for Formal, that took all day since she went into every store atleast twice and ended up buying 3 dresses. But it was fun spending time with her, even though I live with her. Haha gotta love her! Tonight I hung out with Charlie, it was good to see him again.

I'm out...gotta watch Desperate Housewives woot!

Today is Britt and Paul's one year anniversary...awww yay! I am SO happy for them, they're absolutely adorable. Congrats guys! Love ya!

Tomorrow is my mom's Birthday. Last weekend we went out to dinner at Olive Garden to celebrate. Our waiter was sooooo cute and funny, his name was Brian and he goes to university of akron and is a DJ for WZIP (UofA's radio station) haha it made me think of Paul. Anyway, he was awesome, I liked him alot, and he kept talking to me and joking around and stuff, it was cute. He gave my parents free coffee, hmmm haha! He got a very very nice tip.

Classes are going good. I've got tests in all of them coming up in a week or so. I thought they would be easy classes this semester, but I think I'm gonna have to work a little harder than I thought.

I still need to figure out where I'm living next year...and who I'm going to room with...I really need to get on that before there's nothing left.

Winter makes me lonely. Blahh! I wonder what Bob has been up to and how he's doing??? I've been wanting to call him, but for some reason I'm too scared to. Oh well, I'll get a hold of him sometime in the future...maybe. I miss him now...but I think I'm finally over him...idk...

Valentine's Day is coming up. BOOOOOOOOO! I hate V-day, I never have a valentine. I swear they made Valentine's and Sweetest Day to piss off and depress single people. Does anyone wanna be my VALENTINE??? :)

That's about all.
Peace out!

"event","Yay it's the weekend, just finished up my first week of classes. They don't seem to be that bad, it should be pretty easy this semester. They are nicely spread out, 2 classes everyday. I bought my books...only spent $272, I was really surprised it didn't cost more since I had to buy multiple books and such for each of my classes.

At the beginnning of this week my mom was in the hospital for 3 days because she had an irregular heartbeat. They ran a bunch of test and made sure there were no blood clots and didn't find any problems. So then they took the paddles and shocked her heart back into a regular rhythm...that's kinda freaky. She's back at home now on meds, but doing good. She's still looking for a new job...what fun.

I'm really getting sick of this freezing weather and all the snow...we better have a snow day soon, everybody pray we do.

I'm out

"event","I'm back at Kent...yay, here comes Spring semester, it should be smooth. I got back yesterday afternoon. It's kinda lonely here since Britt isn't here yet. I'm just glad that she is coming back to the dorm. So yesterday when I got back I met up with Tristan for coffee, he isn't an RA anymore and is living in Allyn now...Anyway, we talked for a couple hours...it was pretty interesting, he seems kinda different, hmmm...

It's great to be back, break was forever long. It sucked that both my parents were home all of my break, so I had to spend everyday with them..ahhhhh!

You know what's really stupid, we got in trouble for having up ""miniature lights"" a.k.a. string lights and christmas lights in our room. So we got a letter from whoever inspected our room over break saying that we are violating fire codes, so we have to take them down because they are going to come back and make sure they aren't up. How freaking gay, everyone else has lights up.

Ok so I have nothing really interesting to say...just thought I'd update.

Later gators!"

- Christmas Eve we traditionally went to my aunt/uncle house, I got to see all of my cousins, it was great to see them again...it's been awhile. Christmas Day was pretty good, I spend it with the family. I picked out all of my presents so it was no surprise. I got: Season 8 of Friends, Butterfly Effect, True Star- Tommy Girl Perfume, a few hoodies from AE, cute socks from Gap, Gift cards for Best Buy, all kinds of candy, money...hmmm that might be everything. Ohhh yeahhh, Britt got me these really cute penguin pajamas! Anyway, we had dinner at our house with my aunt, uncle, and cuz. Then, later at night we went to my dad's side of the family (a.k.a. the crazy and loud people, geez you would be amazed how hyper these people are) I hadn't seen them in a really really long time so that was fun. I was talking to my aunt and uncle who just moved into a condo in Stow, when they told me where it was at I realized that they moved into the same condo cluster as Britt's mom...hahah they are next door neightbors, wow what a small world. 

- I got an unexpect interesting call from Tristan a few days after christmas. I haven't talked to him since last year after all the drama broke out. We played catch up and he apologized for everything that happened. I'm not sure how I feel about him and all the crap that happened....it really pissed me off. It was nice to hear from him again and know that he knows what a huge asshole he was to me, but also it was kinda awkward. I guess I can learn to forgive and forget...we'll see about that.

I bet it's gonna be the same way with Bob, I won't hear from him for a year. Then, he'll call me and try to pretend nothing ever happened, and that he never ignored me like right now. I never thought Tristan would call me, he's the last person I expected to hear from....Yet the only person I want to call me, hasn't and probably won't ever again. I haven't been able to bring myself to call Bob. Everytime I try to, I end up talking myself out of it. I sent him an email 2.5 weeks ago and I still haven't heard from him...Kristin tried to getting a hold of him too....I'm convinced he's in jail or dead, or just being an asshole who forgot what the last thing was that he told me before he said goodbye, ""we're friends, and we'll talk once in a while to say hi and hang out or something..."" riiiight, we haven't talked since. I'm done...

- My aunt (meaning my biological family) had a little get together the day before new years eve and had me over for dinner. It was great, I got to see my brother and niece and nephew...I think it was the best part of my break so far, I haven't seen them in a couple years. We are suppose to get together again before I go back to school...I can't wait.

- Kristin came up from Columbus for the week of Christmas/ New Years...we hung out a few times, nothing too exciting. We built a snow fort and went sledding in my backyard, and spend all night till the early morning playing my sister's GameCube that she got for christmas...omg I'm like addicted to it.

- New Years sucked, I didn't do anything because none of my friends were home. So I just chilled at home and relaxed...blah.

- Found out that Britt might not being coming back to the dorm this semester, that means I won't have a roommate....damn it *tear*
Pleeeease Britt don't leave me all alone.


OK, I'm sure you're bored with reading about my life....I sure am bored living it. I can't wait to go back to school, my family is sooooo annoying. Well back to my boring life...staying up till 4-5am, sleeping till 2pm, knitting, playing GameCube, and eating like craaaazy! Later!

Love ya bunches

in Innocence. Pure, sweet and child-like. You most<br>likely look far younger than

reputation preceding you. You are most likely<br>rather aware of the realities of
life. You are extremely good natured and<br>trustworthy. By the same token, you are
a bit too trusting. Be careful, few are as honest<br>and open as you. You might
seem girlish still with a love of dresses, ponies,<br>and things most might deem

"event","Thank god finals are over and I can just relax. Wednesday I had 2 exams, art history and math. So Tuesday night a pulled an all nighter to get ready...ahhhh! I think art history went really good, but I died on my math. Then Friday I had 2 more exams, geography and 7 Ideas, both went well I think. Thursday night I ran into Pam and Jenn so we spent almost all night studying together, I only got 3 hrs of sleep. It was really great to hang out with them again, I missed them and our dorm last year.

Yesterday after exams I packed up to come back home...that can be good and bad. My family is already driving me up a wall. I did some of my x-mas shopping last night and some today, I think I have one more gift to buy, then I'm all done. I'm probably going to spend most of break hanging out, reading, knitting, and catching up on sleep. 

I'm out, catch ya later!

"event","I had a great weekend...

Kristin was home from Columbus so I spend almost all weekend with her. Saturday morning I got up and Kristin came to pick me up so we could go shopping. We went to Jo-ann's to buy yarn. I ran out of yarn for my blanket so I had to get more, and Kristin had to buy some so she could make scarfs for everyone as Christmas presents. I bought the same color that I had been using, but when I started knitting with it I noticed that it was a tad different shade. Now why wouldn't they make the color the same everytime?...oh well, I'll make do. Friday night she was suppose to come over but her headlights wouldn't work, so after shopping on Saturday we took her car into the service place. They ended up being burned out...kinda weird that they would burn out at the exact same time. Then, we came back to school and got lunch and watched Mean Girls. Kristin left to go home so she could go out to dinner with her mom.

Kristin came over later that night. Britt got home from work. And I was just sitting around knitting. Delta Chi was having a party, nothing big just a little party for all the initiated guys. We decided to go over there and hang out with Paul. We all got pretty wasted...Thank god it's about time I got drunk there...and period, it's been awhile. We all had a good time being stupid, Britt and Kristin left Bob a few drunken messages on his machine...oops! I broke down whining and almost crying about Bob to Kristin and all these other random people there, I looked like a lunitic. Kristin understood it all since she knew things were over between Bob and I before I even knew...ridiculous. It's not my fault I miss him so much, I know I should just forget about him, but it's easier said than done. Ya know? Britt and Paul left early like 2:30-3am and drove Kristin's car back to the dorm and went to sleep. Kristin and I hung out at the frat till 4am then walked our drunk asses back home. Got some food from Rosies and then went to bed around 6am...unfortunately we both had to get up at 9am because Kristin had to go home so she could leave for Pittsburgh at 10am and I had to meet my group to work on a math project at 10 also. I was soooooooo freakin tired. Luckily the project didn't take very long, I came back and crashed until dinnertime. 

I had a great night, I'm glad Kristin did too...since most of Kent is pretty boring (compared to OSU.) Don't worry Kristin, we'll be down to visit you sooner or later.

Well I'm gonna go knit before bed...night everyone!

Love, Gen....a.k.a. My Little Tomato (Britt's drunken nickname for me, everyone at the party was calling me that.)"

"event","Last week I went home on Tuesday for Thanksgiving break, since my one class on Wednesday was cancelled thankfully! It was really nice to be home even though my dad and sister both told me to just go back to school because they didn't want me at home...thanks, I feel loved. Anyway, I spent Tuesday night writing my Geography paper so I could e-mail it to my prof before Wednesday at noon. By the way, I ended up getting an A on it.

Wednesday morning I had a dentist appointment...boy do I love it when people pick at my teeth. They said that I've got a cavity so I have an appointment to get it filled at the beginning of x-mas break, also over x-mas break I am suppose to get my wisdom teeth out since at the end of December I won't have dental insurance anymore...we'll see if I actually get them out. So, this x-mas break seems like it is going to be a painful one! Hahaha! Bob sent me an e-mail after work on Wednesday to say Happy Thanksgiving and that he's been really really busy and isn't avoiding me intentionally. I was really surprised to hear from him, well atleast he took the time out of his busy schedule to contact me in some way. I really miss him alot, but when I read the e-mail I got this feeling of not caring at all...I don't know. I hope to see him sometime over x-mas break either going out or at work.

For Thanksgiving I went to my cousin Kevin's, always a fun time had by all. A little bit of x-mas was thrown in to Turkey Day, Kevin burned me the new DMX CD and the new Chingy CD...thanks Kev. My aunt cooked an absolutely delicious dinner, it was a nice change from campus food...ewwww! Campus food makes me sick to my stomach, literally. Dinner went well then less than a minutes after we were done eating all the kids (no including myself, im not a kid, im 20 yrs old) ran off to play with Kevin but instead got into trouble for trying to kick his ass, and they all wound up in time-out. Hahaha, what a perfect dessert! It was really great to see my extended family, especially because half of them will be out of town for x-mas.

Friday I spent cleaning out/ taking apart all the furniture in my sister's bedroom to be thrown away. My mom rewarded me by taking to the movies...to see a movie that she wanted to see, hmmmm. We went to see Shall We Dance with Richard Gere and J-Lo, now that is an interesting pair...also Vince from Will and Grace was in to. It was an alright movie.

Saturday was x-mas shopping day so we could miss some of the crowd. I picked out all my gifts for my parents to give me so it kinda sucks that I know everything I'm getting for x-mas, oh well I'll survive. I got some of my shopping done for friends and family, but I'm stumped with what to get my Dad and sister...they refuse to tell me what they want. I hate when people do that.

A week and a half left of classes, a week of finals, then its home for a month for x-mas and new years! Yay! Hopefully I will be able to get a couple of hours in at work, that is if they need me.

17 days left...

It's beddy bye time...

Last saturday (Nov. 13th) was my B-day. Wooohooo the big 20. Yeah right, it sucks getting old, it was no biggie. I totally could have skipped my B-day and I wouldn't have cared, when I woke up in the morning I forgot it was my B-day...that's pretty sad. My family took me out to dinner at the Olive Garden and Britt came along with us...it was yummy! Then, my mom, sister, and I went to see The Polar Express. It was a pretty good movie, kinda freaky in a way, but good! Thanks to everybody who remembered my B-day, and those who didn't...you suck (I'll be expecting a belated happy birthday from you). I got Mean Girls and Season 6 of Friends on DVD, and a couple little things from Britt. Thanks!

My life has been pretty boring...I've seriously basically just sat around doing nothing in the dorm for the past month. I wish I had something to keep me busy. Blah, blah, blah....hmmmmmm.....

Classes are excellent, except for math. I hate that class, it's such a waste of time. Oh well, you'll have that. Hehehehe I love saying that, I miss listening to everybody use that phrase last year.

I miss Bob soooo much, I can't believe how hard I'm taking this. I wrote him a letter telling him about how I feel about everything between us, I dropped it off at work a week ago. We talk for a little bit, but it was really awkward. Things seemed really different with us. Like being friends wasn't an option and wouldn't work...I don't know. I still haven't heard from him with a response to my letter. Oh well whatever. I'm just tired of trying, and I don't understand how he has changed so much in such a short time.

I've got two days of classes this week. Tuesday afternoon I'm going home for Thanksgiving. Yay! I'm pretty excited to see my family, I'm getting kinda sick of being at school all the time. Blah, blah, blah....

That's about it, my life is boring and sucks, and nobody loves me anymore. 

Leave something good guys.

Love, Gen"

I'm wondering if anybody reads this anymore or if I'm wasting my time writing in here? Anyway...

Last week Bob broke up with me *tear* I'm pretty hurt and upset about it. I really didn't want it to be over between us. I guess we are gonna be ""friends"" according to him, which means I won't see or talk to him ever again...I'm not liking that idea at all, but what can I do??...Don't worry, I think I have a plan. I'm not gonna get into any details about the break up right now mainly because I am too lazy to write it all out, but if you want to know what's going on or what happened you can ask me. 

Last night I was at home to celebrate my Dad's birthday. We went out to dinner at Applebees, yummmm. Chicken Quesadillas rock my world!! I was sitting at the table putting sugar in my iced tea when our waitress came over, I wasn't paying any attention while she took the rest of the fam's orders, but when I looked up as she took my order I realized that it was one of my friends from H.S., Danielle Panzero...wow I haven't seen her since before graduation. We talked for a few about school and stuff, she was planning on going to Kent, but is commuting to University of Akron instead. It was great to actually see someone who a graduated with, it's been awhile. After dinner, I went over Ashley's house to hang out with her family for awhile...I love them SOOOOOO much! Ashley and Andy were chillin and carving pumpkins. All I can say is, Pumpkins and Soft Scrub are an amazing combination. HAHAHAHAHA!! 

Today I had to get up early to help my Dad, and step-bro cut down/ cut up an enormous tree that broke in half early in the summer during a storm. Wow...talk about ""worst home videos of cutting down trees"", we need Tree Cutting and Safety 101, Hahaha! First of all we had a rope tied to the tree so we could guide and pull it down as they cut it. That didn't work out to well, they didn't cut it right and the tree ended up going the opposite direction than we intended and almost landed on my mom who was standing on the other side where she thought she was safe...luckily she got out of the way just in the nick of time. After we got the huge tree down on the ground and started cutting off the branches the chainsaw got stuck in one of the knots in the tree. We rolled the tree over so it would relieve some of the pressure from the branch so we could pull the saw out. As we did that the branch that was supporting the tree up off the ground snapped and sent the chainsaw flying out of the tree and through the air, landing 2 feet away from me. Geez, 2 family member almost killed just because my dad felt the need to play with a tree. Hahaha, it's all good, it was worth seeing all the stuff happen.

Ok, well that's all for now.
I'm out like a chainsaw from a tree....hahaha! I know, that was gay! Atleast I try.

Love ya, Gen"

"event","Hey everyone! 
Yeahhhh...so alot of crap has been going on, mostly bad stuff.

- This past weekend my cousin got married. I was sooo happy, the wedding was great and she looked gorgeous. Bob was suppose to go to the wedding with me but ditched me because he had a wedding to go to too. He decided that he was gonna go to his and mine, but never showed up to mine....ASS! I was furious, so instead I went to the reception by myself and drank through the whole thing since I was so pissed off!!

- I have been sick this week with some sort of cold/sinus infection thing. It sucks, but I am starting to get alittle bit better. Gotta love OHIO!

- My internet doesn't work for some reason. I gotta go to Resnet and find out what the deal is. So now I am forced to go to the library whenever I need to use the internet...sorry everyone who usually talk to me online. I'm gonna try and get the problem fixed as soon as I get some time.

- Things with Bob and I aren't going so well. I haven't really talked to him or hung out, he's been a real asshole lately. I know that he has been really busy and has had some important things to deal with, but that is no reason to ignore me. We are suppose to get together tonight after he gets off work to have a TALK...I have an idea of what's gonna happen, but I really hope things can be fixed....we'll see.

- Classes are going pretty good. I had a geography test earlier this week that I was sooo unprepared for, but some how I managed to get an A on it...Shocker! I have an Art History test next week, gotta get cracking on that so I can pull off another A.

I'm out...
I miss my internet...if ya need to get a hold of me just give me a call (330.608.5351) or leave a comment on here.

Love ya lots."

Classes are going really great. Last week I had 2 exams, Art History and Geography...I got A's on both of them. Woot woot baby! Today I had a 7 Ideas exam, I could have done better...we'll have to see. Tomorrow I have a Math exam, I feel pretty good about it...again, we'll have to see. 

Kinda bummed out because I haven't seen Bob in awhile...well a week ago I saw him. It really sucks though, I only get to see him like once every couple weeks cuz he's always busy working and I'm always doing school stuff. I really wish I got to see him more *tear* Oh well hopefully we can figure something out. I miss him.

Britt and I finally got our room somewhat organized. We rearranged all the furniture, nearly killed ourselves and broke everything in the process but we got it done. We just need to get her couch in here and put the carpet down and it will be pretty much finished. 

I think that's about all...I should get to sleep so I can get up for my math exam at 8:50.

Night, love ya.

"event","Not alot has been going on. Let's see...

I went home on Friday to go shopping to find something to wear for my 2 cousins weddings. I had the hardest time finding something. I didn't want to look too casual or look like I was going to prom. After going to 3 malls in 2 days I finally found something...geez! How hard could it be to find a dressy top? The answer is pretty hard.

I came back to school Saturday night. Bob was suppose to go to one of his good friend's b-day party, but instead he showed up at my dorm. He felt bad about Thursday night and wanted to see me so he skipped the party...awwww what a sweetheart! Britt got home from work around 10:00. We ordered wings and chilled. Britt left to drive out to Youngstown to see Paul. Bob and I watched The Ring and drank. He never saw it before, and I ruined it for him because tipsy me was laughing my ass off at every little thing. So much for a scary movie...it is rather hilarious when tipsy though. 

Sunday morning we woke up, Britt came back from Youngstown and called off work...woohoooo! We went to lunch at Burger King, finally a change. I had been eating Taco Bell all summer...ehhhh! Bob and I went over his house so he could get laundry and stuff done. I took my homework over there so I wouldn't be bored and so I could get all my reading done. I got most of it done. We watched Tombstone and American Wedding. Then he made me dinner, awwww yummm. He made a Puerto Rican dish, I was afraid I wasn't gonna like it and hurt his feelings but it was awesome. We came back to the dorm, hung out and watched Office Space. Then it was off to bed so I could get up for my 8:50 math class...blah! I had a fantastic weekend spending it with Bobby!:)

Classes are going alright at this point, I hope it continues going good for the rest of the semester. 

Gotta run to class

"event","Last night we all went out since Kristin is leaving for Columbus tomorrow. Ohhh boy, what a night it was!

Kristin and Britt went up to Delta Chi around 11:30. Bob and I went to meet them there around 12:30 but when we got there we found out that the party got busted by the cops along with some of the other parties in Kent. Damn, thats the second week in a row that I have been screwed over...I need to get drunk! So Kristin, Bob, and I walked up to Screwy's as usual. Tabitha and a few of her friends came up from Ashland to hang out with Kristin before she left for OSU, so we met up with them. We played pool and hung out...and Bob got drunk off his ass which was funny at first, but later led to problems. He and one of his ""hoes"" were all over each other when we were getting ready to leave, they were mainly just talking but getting kinda close...just a tad uncomfortable for me! That made me really upset, I tried to break that up but they ignored me. Kristin tried and was successful, but got in a huge fight with the ""hoe."" Finally we all go outside and are on our way to the car, Bob starts getting in fights with people. I don't know why but whenever he is drunk he tries to fight with strangers. It was quite a hassle trying to settle him down, get his keys from him, and get him to my dorm. We get to my dorm and we spent almost an hour and a half arguing with him and his two friends about how he couldn't drive home. He was convinced that he was fine to drive, yeah right, he could hardly stand or walk. He wouldn't stay the night at my dorm because he didn't want to keep me up all night, and wanted me to get some sleep for my test in the morning. I told him I didn't care about the test, I just wanted to make sure he was OK. Like it really matter then, it was already 3:30am cause I was begging him to stay the night and not drive home. I would have gotten sleep if he would have just stayed and went to bed rather than arguing with me about it. He totally pissed me off refusing to listen to me about not driving home, he just kept saying ""I'm fine! I'm gonna go get my car and have them follow me home"". Riiight, because them following you home is going to prevent you from getting into an accident. I gave up and just walked away leaving them in the parking lot, I know that was wrong but I couldn't handle it anymore. I left it up to Kristin and his two friends to get him home....safely I hope since they had been drinking too. I trusted Kristin, but not his two friends...they kept telling us he was fine to drive...ummm no, he can hardly walk idiots, and that he was going to get his car and drive to his house, but I gave Kristin his keys and she promised me that she wouldn't let him drive.

I went to bed around 3:30am, but couldn't sleep not knowing if Bob and Kristin got home OK. Finally around 5am Kristin called me to say everything was OK, thank goodness. I was still pissed at Bob for being such an ass. 

I got 3 hours of sleep and had to take a math test at 8:50am. That didn't go too bad, but not too good either...who knows, we shall see the final results on Monday. I was exhausted, so after math I came back and went back to bed for a few hours. Bob stopped by while I was sleeping since he was by my dorm getting his car. We talked for awhile, I think Kristin told him how pissed I was...He didn't come out and say it exactly, but I think he was trying to apologize. 

I didn't get to say goodbye to Kristin last night since I walked away from the drama. So Kristin....
I'm gonna miss you alot, work was a blast this summer, I'm gonna miss all the inside jokes (Britt still thinks I'm crazy when I go off babbling about something), have fun and don't get into any trouble, leave me lots of your awesome voicemails. Love ya!

Everybody at work was really happy to see me except Kristin, haha! Angie had to have been the happiest of everyone, even Bob. Ahhh ""PRECIOUS"" that would be my new nickname because now we are best friends cause I don't work there anymore...whateva bitch! So I worked for 5 fabulous hrs and made a shitty $30-$40. 

After work, Bob, Kristin, and I we went to Delta Chi since I was ready to get wasted, but they were out of beer when we got there...damn all those freshman. I was sooo mad, I've been going through alcohol withdrawal since June. We hung out there for a bit with Britt, then after that we went to Screwy's to see some of Bob's friends and get him drinks, oh yeah hahaha and to see his hoes! Right Kristin?! 

We finally all ended up back at the dorm at around 3am, just to part ways again. I hadn't eaten all day so Bob came with me to Rosie's to get some food, Kristin ate all of the food in my room till we came back from Rosie's and then went home...SAFELY thank god, and Britt came back to get changed and then headed over to Paul's for the night. Since everybody left and I had to get up at 8am, Bob and I headed to bed around 4am, but I definitely didn't actually get to sleep till 6am because Bob wouldn't stop talking....Friday sucked running on 2 hours of sleep, oh well.

Yesterday was Kristin's last day of work, all those people are gonna miss us so. We put the entertainment into that place, and the SMILES!

Most people went home yesterday for the 3 day weekend, the campus is dead. I'm going home tomorrow for the night. Anyway, ughhh, of all the people I had to see...Tristan. I was eating dinner at Eastway and across the way I see him with Autumn and their PDA. She was feeding him, WTF, does he not have hands, is he incapable of feeding himself? They were being all kissy and stuff, excuse me I'm trying to eat. He was wearing his bandana, I wonder if he has taken it off since I last saw him in May? Ahhhh ughhh!

Britt and I need to rearrange our room because we don't like how we set it up, it isn't really cute looking. Also we have no idea how we are going to put the carpet down.

Not much else is going on, just classes and such.

Love ya'll

Yesterday was the first day of classes, everything went alot better than I had anticipated. I think this semester is going to go pretty smoothly. I saw so many people that I went to high school with while I was walking around campus these past two days, it was crazy! I've seen a couple people from McSweeney, the usuals, haha. I got breakfast with Kesha, Jenn, and Shelley today, it was so good to see them. Yesterday I saw Pam working at the bookstore and today I saw her working at Eastway. I miss everyone from last year.

I got all my text books which turned out being all paperback books...college algebra, geography, and 7 Ideas...$250, not bad at all for 3 books. Luckily my prof is letting us use the old edition of the art history book, so I didn't have to buy the new edition or it would have been another $100+.

That's all for now. I'll try to update often.

It was a bitter sweet goodbye with awkward moments (explained with one word: Angie), best wishes (Camden), broken hearts (Tony) and no advice (Kelly). Of course we had to celebrate this happy time...Kristin, Bob, and I went out... grabbed some dinner at Taco Bell, then we stopped at Delta Chi (first party of the school year) to hang out with Paul and Britt for a while, grabbed some frat folk and headed over to Screwy's to play pool. I must say, a drunk Britt REALLY entertains me, aww how I love her!! Unfortunately, I did not drink, we all know how that has ruined me in the past, AHHH, but I had fun anyway! After Screwy's everyone split... so Kristin, Bob, and I headed over to my house at about 3:00am, and ended up sitting/laying in the middle of my kitchen floor talking and stuff until 6:00am...yes we do need help! Had some breakfast and finally headed to bed around 7:00am (just as the rest of my family is getting ready to start their day.)

Today my mom had jury duty and was going to be home around 4:00pm to help me move in at Kent...meaning I had all day to pack and get ready to go. Yeah, well things didn't go as planned. I got a phone call at 11:00am from my mom saying she will be home in 10 minutes and wants me ready to leave for Kent...UHHH WHAT? Yeah, I was not packed at all...geez I was still in bed, I had only been sleeping for 4 hours if that. Anyway, I throw everything together in about 2 hours and we moved all my stuff into the dorm and Britt's stuff too, rearranged the furniture, and all that good stuff.

Tomorrow I gotta go to the store and buy toiletries and little things I'll need for the dorm, then finish moving in and hopefully unpack.

Sunday I'm going to my favorite cousin's wedding shower and back to Kent for good, and according to Kristin, she is bring people over to hang out in my dorm!

I miss all my work peeps in many different ways. Love ya!

I've got 4 days of work (Monday-Thursday) left this week, move in at Kent on Friday and Saturday, then Sunday Erica's wedding shower and back to Kent for good that night. 

Lots of changes in store....
Instead of seeing Kristin 24/7, I will now be seeing Britt 24/7 and probably won't see Kristin till after next summer or the summer after. I won't be seeing Bob everyday either at work, I'll be lucky to see him at all now that I'll be at school...it should be interesting to see how everything turns out between us. No more having fun at school, gotta buckle down this year and not screw up or it's over for me. My sleep schedule is so screwed up right now, I don't know what is day and night anymore, gotta get that fixed before the first day of classes, haha.

"event","Yesterday my sister went to this fish collecting contest at Leisure Time pool. I guess what they did was put 1000 goldfish in the pool and as many fish as you collected you got to keep and take home. My sister got 6 which wasn't too bad considering how many other kids were there...I imagine. I got home from work last night and found this awesome looking aquarium that she set up with her 6 new fish, they all looked so happy in their fun/playful home. This morning when I woke up I came downstairs and looked in the aquarium to find one lone fish swimming about...yeah, you guessed it, the other 5 fish died. Right now, the last remaining fish doesn't look too good, he's swimming kinda funky. I figure he will die too in the next couple of hours. How sad :( But, my sister is gonna go to the pet store today and buy some healthier fish.

Tonight I am going to my 3 day driving intervention program. I'm just so excited, you can never learn too much driving information and meet all kinds of interesting people...blahhhh. So, I will be gone until Sunday night, if ya need me call the cell.

I'm out, catch ya in 3 days or be a pal and call me!

"event","Yesterday I went to Southpark Mall with my mom and sister, ended up buying all kinds of stuff. I got a purse from Kaufmann's, 2 hoodies, 2 t-shirts, and a belt from American Eagle, tennis shoes and jewelry from Kohl's. It was a blast, I just love spending money that I can't afford to spend.

Last night, Kristin and I went to see Anchorman at Macedonia. We tried to get Bob to come with us, but he wasn't at home or just not answering the phone, grrr! Anyway, it was a hilarious movie, I highly recommend it!

Is anybody reading my LJ anymore...leave some comments guys!

That's all folks...

"event","I FINALLY got a letter from Kent yesterday...looks like they are accepting me back in but with extremely strict guidelines. It doesn't make sense that they let me back in after they told me 3 weeks ago when I met with the lady handling my appeal that I would most likely not be reinstated, crazy dumbasses. I'm still not sure how I feel about this, I guess I'm happy even though I was sure that I wouldn't get reinstated, and I was all set to work this year and go back next Fall. Oh well, I just hope that I can follow these guidelines and not screw up.

Now I gotta fill out my FAFSA, I really hope I still have time to do that, stupid people had to wait till one month before school starts to inform me about my appeal. Thanks alot KSU.

Time to go shopping so I can spend more money that I don't have!

Buhbye

"event","Kristin finally bought a cell phone today, WOOOHOOOO! I am so happy, words and motions can't even express how over-joyed I am.

My life sucks, I hate being grounded...how am I grounded when I am 19 years old? I have no freakin idea, but it sucks ass. Whatever...I just want to curl up in a little ball somewhere and be left alone, or sleep!

Bye

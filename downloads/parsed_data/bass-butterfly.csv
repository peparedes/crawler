"event","So I like dropped a bunch of hints that maybe things weren't going to work out between us, but he didn't seem to get it. I guess I was wrong about him feeling the same way.

Well, I don't mind hanging out with him and he seems like an alright guy so I guess instead of hurting him I'll just wait for him to figure it out.

Yeah, I'm a wuss.. I know."

"event","It's been a while. 

I went on a few more dates with my Less-Than-Prince-Charming. He's an alright guy, but I don't think I really like him in a romantic way.

To be honest, he's kinda boring and we don't have much in common. I think he's starting to realize that too so it won't be a big deal if I decide to stop seeing him.

Sometimes there's just not any chemistry and that's why some people are never anything more than friends."

"event","Hey! So ok the date wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but he was hardly the Prince Charming my mother and sister made him out to be. He was ""nice"". That's about all I can say about him. And yeah I can deal with a few dates with a ""nice"" guy, but I really would prefer to spend my life with someone who has a little personality. I don't want a criminal or an asshole or a ""bad boy"" I just want someone who's interesting and can actually entertain me and carry on a decent conversation. 

It was an ok time, I guess. We pretty much just met for dinner. He wasn't bad looking. Average 28 yr old lookin guy I guess. Black hair, brown eyes, decent tan. He dressed nice and smelled nice too. And he pulled out my chair for me. He was very polite and it kinda made me feel uncomfortable cause I'm not exactly the most prim and proper girl. For a while I wasn't sure if my sister told him exactly what I do for a living. On a previous occasion like this they told the guy I was a ballet dancer.. lol.

But yeah that had all been told to him. He told he had always wanted to date a woman like me (or what my family had told him about me) because he was tired of the norm. I wanted to make some remark about him being as normal as they come, but I bit my tounge.

After dinner, we took a walk and I said I was tired and decided to go home. He made some attempts to invite himself back to my place (subtely) but I refused. He asked if he could call me and I said yeah. Another date won't kill me and it'll be something to do.

THE END!"

"event","boring day. i did go shoppin though =D

the rest of the day i just layed in bed and chilled. which was nice. cause i've been working so much and i needed some time for me. 

my mother's been harping on me to go to school to be a dental hygenist like my cousin Patty (i have tons of cousins so you'll be hearin alot about them.. lol) but umm i'd rather be a dancer than stare into ppl's mouths all day. 

i may go down to the tech school and see what classes they offer and if somethin sparks my interest than i'll take some time and take a few classes. it can't hurt."

"event","New layout. The product of boredom.  

My cousin Santesa has convinced me to go on a date with a coworker of her's who she says is very ""nice"". I'm taking this to mean he has like 3 eyes. But you never know. He could be very nice and very cute. But they never are. UGH! WHY?!

There's this goddamn fly buzzing around my bedroom and it's really startin to piss me off. So I think I'm gonna go swat the fucker and maybe if I think of anything else to write about I will."

I'll just have to suck it up and act all happy cuz I don't want a reputation as a drama queen. And the girls are so catty that if you give them the slightest hint that you're bitchy they'll blow it up into some huge scenario and the next thing you know your boss is calling you in the office and ripping your face off for starting shit.

I should of been a doctor. Hah!"

"event","This is fucking ridiculous.

I mananged to get an interview at a securities trading firm (stocks and bonds), which is fucking impossible to do as a sophomore.  So, I had to go down to New Jersey to interview.

I catch the 4:00 Fung Wah bus down to New York on Sunday afternoon, catch a cab to take me to Penn station, then take the 9:00 NJ transit out to Edison, where the compnay is located.  I stay overnight with a friend from college then head down to Trillium LLC the next day for my interview.  

The interview is going well, I'm being pleasant and impressive without being arrogant, showing off my credentials and joking around.  It sort of becomes clear that I'm overqualified for this job, and the guy starts talking about how the job takes a ton of work 24/7 when you're busy, but when you're not busy there's not much to do.  So, he needs someone he'll have a good times hanging out with in the downtime.  Then he (Chris Benbow) makes it clear that he's looking for a sports and beer kind of guy to shoot the shit with.  This I am not, and I have to start backpedaling, stop showing off my credentials and be down to earth, so I start talking about all the rock concerts I've been to, trying to connect with him on that level.  It works a little bit, but long story short, I'm fairly sure that I'm not getting the job because I'm not a sports-enthused frat guy.

This is complete fucking bullshit.  Hey Chris Benbow, if you want to hire someone based on their love of sports, that's fine with me, but don't make me come down to mother-fuckin' New Jersey to do it.  You could have just called me up and asked ""hey mike, are you a beer guzzling, sports obsessed frat boy retard?"", and I'd have said, ""No, Chris, I'm not, I guess I'm not very well qualified for this job.""

Fuck you Benbow, the fact that I like natural philosophy and elizabethan drama should be a feather in my cap, not something that keeps me from getting a job.  Oh, and the guy swears in the fucking interview.  I have no preoblem with swearing, I do it all the time, but show some fucking professionalism, jackass.

Anyway, if I don't get this, it will be the first time that I've failed to get something because I wasn't dumb enough."

"event","I can't see an end to any of this work.  I basically haven't stopped studying since Thanksgiving break ended.  Which isn't a very long time.  Except for the fact that I stayed at school and studied during Thanksgiving break.  Besides class, I haven't really left Dunster that much.  Okay, my cousin's wedding this Saturday and to go out to a party Saturday night.  It hasn't all been profoundly difficult, draining studying, I generally go at a fairly leasurely pace.  But, how can I put it?  There's often nothing to differentiate entire strings of days from each other besides the topic that I'm studying.  Normal people can't be living their lives like this.

I wouldn't have it any other way, I realize how lucky I am, but sometimes it makes me reminisce for...I don't know what.  A time in my life when I didn't constantly study.  God only knows how many years ago that was.  Probably the last time was Sophomore year of High School.  Jesus, that was a long time ago.   Almost none of these classes even matter for my major.  Still, I can't stand the thought of getting less than an A in them.  I think that I might tack up a sign that just says B = F on my wall.  That would be awesome.

So, I'm sitting here, not reading the piece that I need to read for tomorrow's class, which is after the test for another class that I've been studying for since Sunday night, and listening to Billy Joel.  I'm ashamed that I like Billy Joel.  I should know better than that.  Fuck it, he may be the king of soft rock and any respectable rock'n'roll fan really shouldn't like him, but........damn it, he's good.

On another note, my cousin's wedding was a mixed bag.  The priest was awful.  He kept on cracking jokes and he spent a good five minutes talking about the patriots.  The reception was fantastic, though.  Great food, nice hall.  Considering the fact that both of my parents were there, it could have gone much worse.  I tried to divide my time between the two of them, but it was still pretty awful.  My mother was depressed because my father was there and my father was upset because of the whole situation.  Then I and my other nineteen year old cousin got to sit at the kids table, so that was fun.  Then I drove myself back to Dunster because my father was still a little tipsy.  He really needs to stop overdoing it at family events.  

Okay, I'm going to go do my reading.  Then I'm going to wake up, study, take my test, go to class, get home and not think about doing anything for a few hours.  Then I'm going to start my paper that is due Friday.  This weekend I'm really going to need to blow off some steam.  Then next week I have two major papers due.  Guess how many major papers I have due next week that I haven't had the time to even think about yet?  Two.  Christmas break really can't come soon enough."

"event","Harvard/Yale weekend is the best weekend of the year.  When you spend so much time studying and stressing, you need breaks like these.

Headed down to Yale Friday afternoon.  I was going to go down on the bus, but Josh (Simmonds) was coming down also to hang out with Dom, Peter and myself (although Peter ended up not coming as he had some orchestra thing), so I hitched a ride down with him.  Got there, dropped my shit in Dom's room and then ran over to the Harvard/Yale Poker Tournament.  Josh, Dom and myself entered (I gave Josh my Harvard sweatshirt so that he could get into the tournie).  We kicked ass for a while.  Josh was doing very well, but apparently got bored and busted out.  I kept on hitting trips and getting fucked over.  I finally busted out on trip queens.  I went all in and this bastard called me and hit a flush on the river.  Dom busted out a few hands later.  Then we headed back to Dom's room, played some vodka pong, which was fun, but sort of a failure.  We didn't have any mixers and obviously you can't put that much vodka into each cup, so each cup kept on getting knocked over, spilling vodka everywhere.  It was my friend Ben and me against Dom and Josh (so, Harvard against Yale and WPI).  Ben and I kicked their asses (the first of several Harvard victories of the weekend), then we hooked up with Dom's girlfriend, Julie, and some of her friends and went saki bombing.  Saki bombing is highly reccomended, by the way.  Also, tried actual sushi for the first time--very good, you've got to love the wasabi burn.  Then we hit up one of the various parties on campus and called up Tom (Coiner), whom none of us had seen in a while because he is currently working at a theater in Kentucky.  We had put together a care package for him (he's a starving actor, he needs it), which had just arrived that day.  So, we all expressed our undying love for each other and then we left the party and went back to Julie's room.  Then I left there with one of Julie's friends.  We hooked up in her room until her roommate interrupted us and then I headed back to Dom's at about 3 in the morning and collapsed on his sofa.

So ended Friday night.  I woke up Saturday morning at about nine.  I grabbed a shower, woke up Ben, who was staying at Dom's also, and Josh.  We grabbed breakfast and headed over to the tailgate for the Harvard/Yale game.  Yale's stadium is about 3 miles from their campus, so we had to catch a bus out there.  Yale's transportation organization was pitiful; we waited literally an hour and a half in line in order to get a bus down there.  All I'm saying is that Harvard's stadium is in walking distance and if it weren't, we would have organized things correctly.  Anyway, we got to the tailgating, met up with Dom, then Ben and I hit up Dunster's tailgating party.  Had some burgers, some barbequed briscuit, a couple of beers, and then Dom, Julie and I went into the game a little bit before halftime.  I snuck Josh in a little bit later.  So, there I was, sitting on the Yale side of the game.  Now for a little history.  There is no rivalry greater than the Harvard/Yale rivalry and this comes boiling up at the annual Harvard/Yale football game.  Yale, I believe, is ahead in total number of games won, but Harvard has kicked their ass for the past four years in a row (last year they were annahilated).  So, there is a whole generation of Yalies whom have never seen their team win.  Now, at halftime, Yale was ahead.  As the game continued Yale got further and further ahead, so the Yalies were going nuts thinking that they were finally going to win.  Then the fourth quarter came and we started schooling them like crazy.  We tied it up and the game went into overtime.  I headed over to the Harvard side and joined in on a few chants of ""safety school"" (for some fun, go to www.safetyschool.org), then headed back to the Yale side.  Long story short, we beat them in overtime, stormed the field, and showed Yale once again which school is superior.  It was fucking sweet.  Yale loses for five years in a row.  Then we headed back to Yale, grabbed some mexican, chilled for a little bit, and then head back up here.

So, here's the tally for the weekend.

Harvard wins in vodka pong.
Harvard wins the poker tournament.
A Harvard player comes in first in the poker tournament.
Harvard wins the football game.

Yale wins.........nothing...and manages to fuck up the bus system.  We went down to their school, kicked their asses all weekend, then headed back up to cambridge.  Now, its time to get back to homework, which I have enough of that I may only come home for Thanksgiving day and then head back up to Harvard to get a head start on tests and papers.

Anyway, a good weekend and a much-needed break."

"event","Just saw Aerosmith/Lenny Kravitz.

$55.00 for an 1:15 of Lenny and 2:00 of Aerosmith.  Good deal.

Earlier today I remembered that Aerosmith was playing tonight.  I had heard that they were having trouble selling tickets, so I thought that I could try and snag some tickets.  I invited the roomie, who was interested, but ultimately decided not to go.  Ben decided that he'd rather go to the Dunster happy hour.  Josh had a party that he wanted to go to.  I called up a friend from High School who works in the city, but he was getting out of work too late.  At this point I said ""fuck it"" and just went down myself.  Frankly, I wasn't really interested in trying to scrounge up someone else to go with (and it was about an hour and a half before the show, so I didn't have much time) and frankly I wasn't interested in the other options, sitting in my room playing online poker or drinking cheap alcohol at Happy Hour with Ben and company.

So, I headed down to the TB Banknorth Garden (AKA the Fleet Center) and found, to my delight, that they were selling tickets.  The seat was literally the worst seat in the house.  Very last row, directly behind the stage.  I bought it.

Once house lights went down, I moved to a good seat and remained there for all of Lenny's set, then got kicked out by the person who had actually paid for the seat.  I went to a couple of spots where people were standing, watching the show, and got kicked out a couple of times until I finally found a good seat that was actually free (front row, balcony, right of the stage), where I plopped down and enjoyed the concert.

Aerosmith were very good.  Second best show I've seen.  Nothing has topped the Stones yet, though.  Lenny Kravitz didn't suck as much as I thought he would.  Strong set, pretty good retro-rock/funk, not amazing, but solid.  Aerosmith, though.  Steven Tyler can still hit the high notes (although his voice cracked and he started laughing during one particularly high screech), and Joe Perry was in fine form.  I dug most of the stage antics (extra points to Joe Perry for putting his guitar on the ground, tearing off his shirt, and wailing on the guitar with said shirt;  great musicianship it may not have been, but it was undoubtedly badass), and the band seemed to be in fine form.  No major slip-ups, and I felt my face starting to melt during a few of Perry's solos.

Great show...but the Stones are still on top.

You know, something like this reminds me how great it is to live in the city.  There are amazing things happening all the time and they're all just a T-ride away.  Next weekend is Harvard/Yale, and the weekend after that has about fifteen tests/papers involved, but the next weekend that I have free (God only knows when that will actually turn out to be) I'm going to hit up a play or a museum.  I'll tell you this much, it'll be better than going to a cramped party in somebody's room (which is, unfortunately, de rigueur at Harvard)."

"event","Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.  Long story short, I hate English and am 93% sure I'm switching my major to economics.  The things I'm considering doing after college--investment banking, consulting, law school, etc.--are much better served by a degree in economics, plus I hate English.  Well, let me rephrase that:  I love literature, but have little respect for the study of literature.  I don't like the people in the English department (pretentious, goatee sporting fuckers--well, not all of them), and I can't really respect myself as an English major.

This isn't really a freak-out about my future, rather its an acknowledgement of what I dislike in the present.  I could do all of the things I listed with an English degree--that is a fact.  But, seeing as how I'm having a fairly negative reaction to the major, it doesn't make sense to go after that degree.  Hey, if someone has passion for something, they should chase it, regardless of how secure it'll make their future.  But, as much passion as I have for literature, I have no passion for the study of literature.  Plus, economics is cool and just quantitative enough for me.  I can't deal with this profound subjectivity bullshit.  Plus, where before the thought of reading some Ben Jonson or Christopher Marlowe would have excited me, now it sickens me.  I guess I'll always be an armchair Elizabethan dramatist and and armchair Medivalist, and I'm completely cool with that.

Anyway, what else have I been up to?

Saw Hot Hot Heat/Weezer/Foo Fighters in Worcester last week.  HHH was good, very 70s rock minus the guitar solos, so I enjoyed it.  Weezer was pretty good.  Their lead singer goes here and my friend was in a class with him and likes Weezer a lot, so he dragged me to the concert.  Foo Fighters were awful.  I couldn't tell where one song started and one began.  Jesus Christ, Dave Grohl, is it too much to ask that you write me a riff or a melody?  Oh, sorry, I guess that you'd rather bang on one chord and scream every once in a while.  What's that, are you still making a living off of your association with Kurt Cobain, the guy who made rock and roll suck?  Yes.......Yes you are.  Why don't you go pound out something for a group of frat-boy alcoholics to mosh to, that sounds like a good idea.

Anyway.

What else has been happening?

I love my house (upperclass dorms at Harvard are called houses).  My room is great.  Got a good roommate, sweet facilities.

I'm starting to feel like I finally have shit figured out.  At least as much as one can be expected to have shit figured out at 19."

"event","I'll begin at the beginning.

Tonight was the last night of the show I was in, ""This Is Our Youth.""  The show was a great experience, by far the best show that I've done so far at Harvard.  Harvard theater is interesting:  I've met some great, talented people and been a part of some great productions, and Harvard theater can be very very good, but here's the thing--a lot of the time it's artsy, pretentious bullcrap.  A lot of the time half the audience leaves during intermission.  That didn't happen in this show.  I can honestly say that this was the first time I was in a show that got a genuine standing ovation and a genuine encore bow.  It was great.

It was after the close of the show that my night began to get ridiculous.  We struck the set unbelievably fast, had the whole thing down in an hour, and then went to have a cast party.  Now, our producer is a rich, charming british guy, so where else would we hold our cast party except in the apartment shared by a group of rich, charming british guys who vaguely helped out with the show?  The cast was really small, just me and two other people, and we really only had a core directorial/production staff of three or four people, so add in about three british guys and you wind up with a pretty small group.    It was fun, but not really my scene.  This conversation was overheard by myself:

Cast Member:  Hey, where did you go to high school?
British Guy:  Westminster, do you know it?
Cast Member:  Not really, I've only ever heard of Westminster Abbey.
British Guy:  Exactly, my school owns that.
Cast Member:  Oh...
Me (mentally):  Deuchbag

Actually, everyone was really cool, it was a lot of fun, and after some champaign and some saki, it was time to bid a bittersweet farewell to the show.  We all headed home, and I got back to my dorm at about two-thirty.  Ben was up, so I chatted with him, and then went to the bathroom to shower and shave.  I hadn't washed my hair or shaved in a solid week and a half because the director of This Is Our Youth wanted me to be scruffy for the show.  So, I took my shower, then got down to shaving.  I have always used an electric razor because they are more convenient, and so started to part my hairs from my face with said electric razor.  About halfway through, I saw that my razor is clogged up, so I opened in up and ran the water over it to clear the hair from the blades.  I had neglected to unplugg the razor, however, and so, with my hand touching the water running over the razor, managed to give myself a bit of a shock.  I shook it off, closed up the razor, and began to return to shaving when I realized that my razor had stopped functioning.  As I stood there, half shaven at three in the morning, my stomach sank.  Then I realized that Ben was still up, so I waddled over to his room to borrow his razor.

Here's an interesting fact about Ben:  the guy has an almost crippling fear of diseases.  Upon hearing my request for his razor, he immediately replied ""isn't that not good to share razors?""  I looked him in the eye for a good five seconds, came to the understanding that this was one subject not to push him on, and told him not to worry about it.  As I closed his door, I mentally informed him that he was a fucking deuchbag.

So, with everyone else asleep, my only option was the friendly neighborhood 24-hour CVS.  I remembered having seen electric razors on sale there earlier, so I was pretty hopeful that my mission would come to fruition.  I found no such razors, just the non-electrified kind, and I immediately abandoned the idea of learning how to shave with an actual razor as it was three-thirty in the morning.  Frustrated by my inability to find the product I was looking for, I began to entreat the kindly CVS workers for aid.  Sadly, there was actually no one on duty at this particular CVS at three-thirty in the morning for whom english was a first language.  I make no judgements of course, but am merely expressing my frustration with this fact.  Motivated by my inability to effectively communicate with the CVS employees, I left the store.

By this time it was four in the morning, and I wandered down to the only other store open at that hour, the 7-11.  I found no razors, but at least I brightened the clerk's morning when he saw that I had only shaved half of my face.

Accepting the fact that wandering around Cambridge at four in the morning probably wouldn't produce a razor, and recognizing that I had work due tomorrow that I had to do, I returned to my room and proceeded to fiddle with my broken razor for a good ten minutes.  To my horror and delight, after venturing into the bathroom and thrashing the device against the sink, it sprung back to life.

Having adequately shaved myself, I completed my work, slept a few hours, woke up the next morning, went to class, made a phone call about a theatrical internship, then hopped on the T, got picked up by a representative from OAR, and came back into town to interview for an internship teaching environmental science.  I then returned, ate dinner, finished watching Julie Taymor's Titus, wrote a review and collapsed in bed.

Last night Ben and I hit up ""Mather Lather,"" which was a party in the Mather House dining hall where they hired someone to bring in this huge lather machine.  Basically, it was like any other dance except everyone was in bathing suits gringing in the middle of this huge cloud of lather.  Anyway, it was pretty awesome, although we had to walk all the way back to our dorm soaked through and covered in lather at two in the morning.  Yah, that kind of sucked.

What else is going on?

I'm in two shows right now, This Is Our Youth and Abu Ghraib.  I think that they'll both be good.  The show that I was in earlier, Antigone, wasn't so good.  Anyway, I play an Iragi prisoner in Abu Ghraib (don't ask me, really don't, the director believes in colorblind casting...whatever).  Basically, I get the living crap beat out of me and there's always something new.  Like, I go in for rehearsal one night at about 11:30 and find out that we're doing a scene in which a soldier forces me to give head to another prisoner (not literally of course, its more of a simulation that goes on between two other scenes), so needless to say I was totally psyched about that.  Anyway, Abu Ghraib will either blow or be totally awesome.  If I can get my lines down for This Is Our Youth, then I think that that will be good too.

Hmm...what else is going on?

I'm going to declare myself as an English/Literature major.  Right now I'd like to study Shakespeare and Marlowe and romantic era poetry.  I feel pretty happy with my choice, but I could always change my mind.  I figure I'll end up going to grad-school after college and end up somewhere in academia.  Right now, I really don't have any other plan besides that.  Hey, if I decide I want to make money, there's always law school.  Or I could be an i-banker.  Not that I'm really clear on what investment banking is (I don't think that anyone else is either), but from what I understand many people from Harvard go into it after college, you don't really need a specific background for it (just to have connections and be an intelligent, educated person), and you make a shitload.  Actually, I talking out my ass there, the chances that I'll go into i-banking are slim to none, although I plan to learn more about it next year.

Anyway, that's about it.  It's beautiful out, so I'm going to go throw the frisbee around for a bit.

"event","Haven't updated in a while.  So...what's been happening?  Went down to Ohio to visit Tom a few weeks ago.  Drove all night and surprised him at about ten in the morning.  Saw his show.  Very good time.  Tom was excellent, I had fogotten just how good he is.

Anyway, I have my new classes.  Athenian Democracy, Expository Writing:  Shakespeare, Old English, Introduction to Acting, Acting Shakespeare.  This semester feels really good.

I just finished Common Casting.  I tried out for fourteen shows, got called back for eight, and got cast in five.  I still haven't heard back from the student films.  Well, I guess not really cast in five because two of the parts I'm just the alternate for a part.  Which is fine because of the other three two are decently sized parts and one is the lead.  So, I'm going to do the one that I got the lead for unless the films want me and there is a conflict (sorry, the films pay you, not much, but more than nothing).  I was thinking, and I don't know if I've ever actually been the lead in anything.  I usually just get decently sized character parts.  So, I guess I'm pretty happy.  Although it will suck giving up one of the other parts, which is really cool.  He's a cop and it's kind of a riff on the whole law and order tough guy cop genre.  I wonder if I can do both?

Anyway, Amanda, if you read this, I got a couple of free tickets to Far Side of the Moon in one of my classes, but they're probably not valid still.  I forget if you wanted me to get the tickets or not (I think I can get them for 10 or 12 bucks).  Anyway, let me know.  And if you already told me, remind me that I'm an idiot.  I've heard the Far Side of the Moon is fantastic, so I'm pretty psyched to see it.

What else is happening?  Ben and Will and I (and Riad I think) are planning a trip out to UMass Amherst.  They want to see Greenday and I'm up for a trip and willing to see Greenday, so it should be a good time.  We're going down at the end of April.  Although I have no idea how we're going to get there because the only person we know who lives around here and has a car doesn't want to go (Josh).  So, we might end up taking the bus, but that would be kind of lame.

Anyway, there's the update.  Peace out.

Chem is tortuous.  At this point I really really hate it and I'll have to study like crazy from now until Friday to get a decent grade and there's nothing worse than studying hard for something you absolutely despise.  Whew, I'm stressed.  I didn't really like my classes this semester, but at least I'm learning what direction I want to go in.

Primal Scream this weekend was awesome.  Basically on midnight on the Saturday before finals (this weekend) everyone takes a few laps around the yard naked.    I ran it with some people from my building (couldn't convince Josh or Ben to run it).  It was weird because it was a big spectacle.  The band was there playing and people packed the yard so that you ran in a sort of ring lined with people.  The fact that tons of people were there wasn't that weird, but a lot of people had cameras and a few had set up tripods, which is a little sketchy.  Man, it was cold that night.

Anyway, I have a week of break starting the 26th.  Don't ask me what I'm going to do with a week off and nobody else home.  This school is fucking weird.  Maybe I'll go visit Dave at RPI, take the train down."

Then later on we ended up having sort of a guitar fest.  One of the guys next to me, Steve, although he has never played guitar, was playing all kinds of songs on my guitar, he plays the violin and the piano and knows music really well, so once he got the basics down he just transferred over everything that he knew.  Then Will picked up his electric guitar and started going to town on it--needless to say, it was pretty sweet.  

I want to take guitar lessons, but it'll be pricey, which will mean a job.  Which is fine, it's about damn time anyway.

""With the increasing globalization of the world, we know that some Iraqis do listen to American music, even heavy metal, on the Internet, the radio and TV,"" Kuehl said. ""Even during the height of the Taliban, they could get Western music or videos.""

What the fuck does the taliban have to do with Iraqis?

I never really bought the idea that the American populous believed that Irag and Al-Qaeda were fundamentally connected (I give people more credit than that, and the connections between the two are outrageously tenuous at best), despite media reports that this was in fact so, but here is a high-ranking military official who apparently believes Iraq and Al-Qaeda to be the same thing.  More than this, the newspaper didn't catch this.  It's outrageous and disappointing."

Actually, we did finally find a party, but it turned out to be the gay party, which was actually pretty happening, but the guy down the hall from me, Brennan, started grinding with me and then I decided, ""Brenan, man, I love you, but I've got to take off.""  But, Harvard kicked Yale's ass in the game today, the tailgating was increadible, and tonight there were plenty of parties.

Last night was fun, but I didn't get to bed until about 4 and I woke up today when my uncle called at 1:30--he was in town with my cousin and brother, so I got to see them.

You guys back in Hudson should let me know when the shows are this year, I'll definitely be back for them."

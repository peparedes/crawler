I don't take my whiskey to extremes 
Don't believe in chasin' crazy dreams 
My feet are planted firmly on the ground 
But darlin' when you come around 

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes 
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone 
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you 
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away. 

It might seem like an ordinary night 
Same ol' stars, the same ol' moon up high 
But when I see you standin' at your door 
Nothin's ordinary anymore. 

I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes 
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone 
I get carried away nothin' matters but bein' with you 
Like a feather flyin' high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away.

did that by memory sorry if its a lil off lol -much <33 - jessica rae"

"event","It never ceases to amaze me how silly girls can become just because of a boy. And when im talking about girls, I mean me in particular... School was just about as typical as always, after school i hung out with Scott then I convinced him to go with me to the swim meet... This is why i feel like a junior high girl. If you need further explaination, sorry, none will be given. I've gotta get this boy off of my mind. More than likely it will never happen, and I'm just fine with that. Nine more months... nine more. If I constantly remind myself of that maybe i'll continue on my path towards the nunnary. Like i tell everyone, I WILL become the first non-catholic nun. It's meant to be! Haha, and if my dream fails me Stacy and I will live with our parents for a while, then move into an apartment and have hundreds of kitty cats! But then again, I will always be a silly romantic girl, with silly fantasies of a prince charming. I thought i had found him my eighth grade year, but that only lasted til the beginning of my junior year. It's kinda hard to get over, but I somehow find a way to forget. Or at least fill my time with other things so i dont have time to remember it. That's such a long story with so many complications, maybe i'll tell it another day, but right now im full of too many thoughts to compile anything that would make much sense to anyone but myself. 

I dont really feel like opening myself up for heartbreak or a crushed heart, or really anything having to do with pain and my heart. If this makes me sound silly or stupid, i dont really care... 

On a brighter note, I got my acceptance letter to OU on Thursday, I was excited and i still am, but its kinda scary thinking about being so far from home. I've always been the independant type, but not seeing my parents for months at a time is a little scary. Dont get me wrong i cant wait, but somewhere deep down inside a part of me doesnt want to give up Tomball. My mom thinks im growing up, but it feels like quite the opposite sometimes. Who knows, obviously not I... im gonna go to bed now, but i'll leave you with this song.


Though I keep searching for an answer, I never seem to find what I'm looking for, 
Oh Lord, I pray You give me strength to carry on 
Cause I know what it means 
To walk along the lonely street of dreams 

And here I go again on my own 
Goin down the only road I've ever known 
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone 
An I've made up my mind 
I ain't wasting no more time,
cause here i go again."

"event","SUCH A STRANGE DAY! I woke up very late but managed to throw some jeans on and a shirt and run out the door fairly close to my normal schedule. I drank my coffee and drove to school by myself... talk about a lonely morning! It was an alright day overall though, nothing too interesting. I rented movies... and i kinda worked on art. I'm about to head to younglife, hopefully we'll get the number of people there we need to shave Watson's head. 

I'm a little nervous for numerous reasons, Stacy knows what I am talking about, and since i figured she was the only one reading this... i feel a little awkward expressing myself, but i guess since this is a LIVE journal i should have figured. So, here goes...

I think this boy is very cute. I get kinda nervous around him. I fumble words around and feel like an incompetent loser... So thats basically how it goes. I dont really know why talking to him is so hard, i guess i just.. oh i dont know. My cousin is kinda pushing me to get his number/sn but i dont want to do anything that could possibly place me in an awkward situation... Especially since i have class with him for the rest of the year. I mean seriously, i know the worst that could happen and i know the best that could happen, but how often do we set ourselves up for disappointment? I'm going off to college in Oklahoma in like 9 months... should i just stick it out and finish the year without a boyfriend? or should i risk my dignity for a boy who i might not see after graduation?... tough choices ahead.... we'll see.... ahh, sometimes i wish things were simpler. Nothing ever can go according to my plan, which is AMAZINGLY difficult to comprehend, but at the same time GREAT because if i were in control of the whole universe like God, lets face it i'd mess things up. God knows what he's doing, lucky for us, and his plan doesnt have to fit ours. In the grand scheme of things, God's plan is ultimately better for us, not just now but forever! AHhh thank you God for making me realize this! BOYZ SCHMOIZE! Who needs a boy when i've got the greatest GOD who loves me unconditionally for who i am, not what i wear or who im friends with? 

But anyway, back to Earth and all of its wonders? Oh man... well im gonna finsih some homework, but im glad i got all of that off my chest!"

"event","Let me start out by saying that I've never been so tired in my entire lifetime... Between staying up WAY too late and cheerleading, I've worn myself to the bone... mentally of course, because im still fat on the outside unfortunately... but hey it happens to the best of us right? Mental wearing out, that is, not fatness, lol! I have this art project thats due Friday and a government project due that day as well, but ive almost finished them both... no procrastination this time... im suprising myself so much! I need to finish this and get offline but im so sore i can hardly move. Imagine how im gonna be tomorrow, yikes! So today i have a typical day other than the fact that some stupid girl in 5th period yearbook keeps messing up my deposits for yearbook... i have to count thousands of checks and money for yearbooks and ads and it takes forever to sort out and once i get halfway through she messes it alllll up. Im so tired of redoing my work! GRRRR.... But yeah everything else was normal. English i took a long nap with this guy Ryan's letter jacket... i dont know why but i find him soooo attractive. I mean hes not like typical jock type. He swims and hes in band... how cute would that be a band geek with a cheerleader.... ok back from fantasyland. So yeah he definitely offered it to me i was like okay!!!!! It was way cute if i do say so myself. The nap was excellent and much needed, and i do believe its the first time i was actually fully knocked out in a class. I was so gone, lol! Health was boring except Megan and Taylor came in and talked to us and Tally and I jumped rope in the class for a few minutes. I love that class though because Brandon and Alex are in there... seriously its wonderful, because they are the epitome of hottness, like probably beyond that, they are beautiful! haha... i feel gay, so now im stopping. I had tomball practice and we did a few fullout routines, then went to chick-fil-a, worked on art with a million gawking people staring while i worked (want to talk about making someone nervous), and then had a killer practice. I'm gonna be dead by the time we get through it all... i guess ill have to condition the heck out of myself to get the stamina ill need to do this routine... well im off to bed now, or i guess work on homework then bed, i should say.

"event","So here's the deal, Friday I was supposed to go to the movies with Adam and he never talked to me that night. He was on but didnt even talk really when I imed him. I was so mad, but Steph got home and I decided to go over there to hang out with her. We went to Zebo's (for those of you who arent tomballers its a coffee house in tomball, the best ever!) and talked for about an hour. We drove to McDonalds to meet up with her little brother David and chatted with him for a while. Caleb called so we met him at WalMart and caught up for a while but then I had to go home to go to bed. I dropped Steph off at home and went home, talked online for a bit, did laundry, and made cookies for the cheer clinic. That night I ended up going to bed around 2:30 and I had to wake up at 6. We picked up Becky and Brittney, got donuts and went to the clinic. It was a VERY long day and some little girls clung to me the entire time. We ate Subway on the way to the football game. The football game was very disappointing, but much needed to deflate our cocky football players heads. As soon as I got home I took an hour long nap which was much needed then headed to Stacy's to go to the family birthday party. We stayed for a bit then went to Kayla's birthday party and I met some very cool people. After that we went to the football game to meet up with Brandon, and we decided to leave early to go to Taco Bell. We drove there but didnt stay we went to the movies to meet Brandon, his dad, and his friend Collin to see Friday Night Lights. We got some pizza then went to the movie. It was good, kind of disappointing but good. I took Stacy home and picked up Stephanie, we went straight to bed. I woke up today around 2 did a little homework, watched the Texans and Astros for a little bit, then headed to practice. It was alittle tiring but good, we got some choreography done and it looks awesome! I'm so excited Queen B's!!! I'm home now and need to work on some english, art, and i need to take a shower... I guess i'll get to that stuff.... adios"

"event","Hallelujahhhhh, Praise God! I had such a better day today, school was typical, but after school Gabby and I decided to be spontaneous. We went to the park and swung on the swings and went down the slides. It was a wonderful afternoon, I relaxed and got to do my favorite thing in the entire world. We talked about how hott Johnny Depp is as a pirate (Pirates of the Caribbean) and other fun things. She climbed a tree which was HILARIOUS to watch and i took some funny pics. We got on the play set thingy and someone wrote about how hott some girl was all over and we laughed at it. I felt like a little girl again, no worries or stresses about grades, boys, or college. We slid down a few slides and decided to be even more spontaneous, we went to the movies and picked a random movie to see. We got some ice cream while we waited for our movie to start. Then we went in and watched our movie, Cellular... it was soooo good! It was awesome i'm so glad we chose that one! While we were there this guy sits next to us, in an empty movie theatre... it happened to be a spanish teacher and tennis coach at our school, coach chavez. He's such a funny man! So it ended and i took her home and now im home writing about the day. Now I'm gonna go take a shower and get all cozy and maybe watch another movie or do some homework to get it over with! I just found out great news! My bestest friend in the WHOOLEE wide world is home from college today! I'm soooo excited i get to go to CiCi's to meet up with her! Yay!

More Spontanuity, is that the correct spelling, im sure stacy will correct me if its not!

"event","From the title im sure you can make the assumption that it was a bad day. I went to bed extremely late last night finishing an art project and some government homework... I got to bed around 2:30. I woke up at like 6:15 put my glasses on got my coffee (which was WAY too hot to drink) and headed out the door. I got to school and tried to drink my coffee but ended up burning the crud out of my tongue... needless to say I didn't drink it and this is the reason my day must have gone so wrong. All because I didnt have my coffee this morning. I warned yall about my coffee addiction.... so my mood was already crappy, plus i looked crappy because i wore my capri pj pants and a long sleeve t-shirt and i didnt feel like putting my contacts in so i just put my glasses on. First period is cheerleading, and there is a lot of tension on varsity... actually just 3 out of the 4 seniors. I'm the middleman kind of i just mediate... After class our coach took the seniors to her class to discuss this whole PowderPuff drama stuff and i was like hmm im missing class to be pulled into all this drama mess. It took almost the entire class period til we finally finished and that was one of the final touches on my crappy day. The next class was government and it was alright except i have like 2 hours of homework... soooo not cool, but whatever. In art my teacher was driving me INSANE! I love her to death and i'm her favorite, but she was having an equally bad day and it just made things worse. English was fun it always is, i love Youngblood! He's such a great teacher. Health was ok.. boring as ever, but at least we do nothing in that class. We played hangman with some words from the back of the book. I left school and took Gabby home and now im on here venting about my no good, very bad, terrible, awful, horrible day.... I have to go to this football/cheerleader spaghetti dinner thing so i need to go get ready... leave me some messages so i feel loved..."

"event","Sooooo today was my Senior Picnic... it was so much fun and I got to hang out with a good friend of mine I haven't gotten to hang out with in forever, Miss Lindsey Chapline! Gosh i love that girl! I have like a million pics of the day which is always fun because they are just so durn cute! So i get up kinda late today, but i was greeted by my mom with a bigggg cup of coffee... gosh none of you would want to see me if i didnt have my coffee... yikes! Then I drove to school and did my makeup in the car while listening to LeAnn Rimes... gosh i love that cd! I got my senior shirt which is super cute and then talked to Scott and Justin and them and we had a senior class meeting about caps and gowns and all that fun junk we get to buy, by the way i better be getting nice graduation gifts from all of you! We got on a bus and it just so happened Justin (Feil) and i were on the same bus and since i didnt know anyone on my bus we sat together... kinda awkward but oh well it was like a 10 minute trip. We ate doughnuts once we got there and played kickball.... my team definitely didnt dominate but hey it happens. So then all this drama happened about PowderPuff Football and cheerleading coaches... its a long story but the readers digest version is miscommunication about who the coaches would be and someone thought they werent gonna be able to do it, and their parents called and complained and it was just not fun... but it was solved later in the day. Nathan taught me how to ""properly"" take a handoff in football it was fun and then he taught me how to correctly throw a spiral football, and i was a baller at it! haha! I watched baseball and volleyball played on the swings and ate a hamburger and an AMAZING cookie from Carrie's Kitchen... We were there from 9-2 and believe me I enjoyed every single minute of it. OHHH and a few guys thought it would be funny the first 30 minutes we got there to get all the girls wet... so not cool! So needless to say my hair was a fro... and bye bye makeup but its ok i still looked hott! hahah jk. Other than that it was great. I left school around 2:15 and went up to Texas Cheer for Tomball Practice at 3:30... i was really early but i watched Langham Creek practice and tumbled a bit. I had 2 practices today, the Tomball one til 5 and then Texas Cheer Senior Girls practice 7-9. The first practice was hard we ran full out routines, but it was a good one. Texas was fun because we got to do choreography with Bryson, and gosh i love that guy! The counts are megafast but its so awesome and looks incredible! I'm super pumped for our first competition which is Nov. 13th... hopefully i'll see ALL of you there! I got home and Adam called and we talked a little bit, then i got in the shower and now im retelling my day! Awesome, i know! So im so excited about tomorrow and Friday because i get to hang out with Adam after he gets off work. I dont know what we're doing tomorrow but we're going to see a movie on Friday and who knows... but yeah im excited he's so gorgeous! Well have a great day because i will!

"event","Here goes nothing... I decided to start this once again, and maybe for once i'll continue doing it. Today was relatively boring, the normal Tuesday i guess. In cheerleading we went over things for the cheer clinic this saturday, which took about 20 minutes, and the rest of the time was spent reading My Utmost For His Highest. Yearbook I did advertising stuff, like read mail, write receipts, count money, etc. Government was spent checking my phone for text messages and writing some little summary thing. In art we critiqued our concentration pieces and discused our next project... while i ate my fundraiser candy... ooops! It was soooo good i got chocolate covered english toffee! I bet your jealous of me! Then i went to Youngblood's room for English CC and we talked about Senior Picnic and some other college stuff... and for those of you who aren't fortunate enough to go to Tomball High School, tomorrow is Senior Picnic. We go to a park all day and play and kareoke and all sorts of other fun stuff! Im so excited! I went to lunch but wasn't really hungry so i read some more, and then headed off to health. We watched a movie on smoking which was quite interesting i guess but i looked at pictures and played bejeweled for a good deal of the class period. Ashley Creppon and I had to go to our coaches house for this cheer clinic cd thing. It was funny trying to record all these cheers and stuff. I felt so gay! Afterwards i went to Hobby Lobby to get glass for my project and i cut myself about 8 times on the way to the register. I shattered the glass when i got home (on purpose) and then picked it up so noone would step on it. Then i balanced my checkbook only to discover i am -$37... another ooops! Its ok my mommy and daddy fixed it! I do however know how to balance a checkbook and also know that if i get -$ then i have a $17 charge for each thing... yikes! So then i ate dinner and started watching The Prince of Egypt with my little sister... how sweet am i? I need to get going on the 2 art projects i gotta finish though, so ill update later... Oh and I need a man... anyone interested may come by my house and pick up an application. Forms are due by November 1.... haha im just kidding but yeah seriously though... 
                One day my Prince will come!
Faith Hill, Love Ain't Like That

You can't buy it at the store 
Try it on for size 
Then bring it back if it don't feel right 
No love, love ain't like that 

You can't trade it in 
Like an automobile 
That's got too many miles an' rust on it's wheels 
No love, love ain't like that 

Love ain't that easy to define 
You can't build it by design 
It takes its own sweet time 

It don't fall from the sky 
Like a tiny drop of rain 
That hits you right between the eyes one day 
No love, love ain't like that 

You can't put your money down 
An' just roll the dice 
Think you're gonna win it all some night 
No love, love ain't like that"

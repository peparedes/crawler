"event","Maybe I shouldn't be allowed to have friends. I always hurt their feelings. I don't know how, but I always manage to hurt their feelings. I guess I should think a lot more before I talk, not think about what I want to say, but think about how what I say will effect the person I'm talking to, as well as other people, too. That is my definition of gossip--if someone is offended by what I say, that is gossip. Maybe that's a little too narrow, because someone might be offended if I say ""George Bush is president."" But I guess in my mind that's what i'll go by. I can say something if the person I am talking to and the person I am talking about wouldn't be hurt by it. We'll see what happens. It'll probably end up with me talking a lot less. I also have to remember that no matter how I think, not everyone else will think the same way."

I got a disease 
Deep inside me 
Makes me feel uneasy baby 
I can't live without you 
Tell me what I am supposed to do about it 
Keep your distance from it 
Don't pay no attention to me 
I got a disease 

Now, you may be thinking I'm talking about the polymyositis, but no. After looking at it, comparing ""the boy"" to ""the disease"" is not far off at all. And, it made me realize the next time I feel like ""I can't live without you,"" I definitely better make sure that he feels the exact same way. I'll work on a comparing ""The Boy"" and ""The Disease"". That might be interesting, but I'll work on it later...

"event","The more I sit here, the more I think about it. I feel like I've lost my best friend. I used to feel like I could tell him anything in the whole world, but I can't. This is for the best. It has to be for the best. Maybe I should just take his advice and get a hobby, get something to get him off of my mind. And something positive of course. I don't want to avoid it forever, but maybe if I avoid it for a little bit, it won't be as pressing and annoying and stressful. I just don't know what to do. I mean, I've gotten over plenty of boys before, but I've never felt so strongly and then had to let go, but he's not into me, so it's not worth my wasting my time, and to tell the complete truth, i'll never be happy being his friend, I'll always want more and being around him will just be a tease of what I can't have. So, Project Avoid Him has to begin, because I'm going to go crazy if I don't..although some would say I've already gone crazy. 

Plus, my sister drives me nuts. Who says that once she wakes up the entire house wants to listen to her music? I sure don't. It's garbage. It's crap, and I don't like it. Pardon the complaints. I would have complained to my best friend, but I just lost him. Probably why..because I have a problem with complaining too much or just being downright obnoxious and clingy. Or, self-focused. Or maybe I think too much? Who knows? He's gone and I've lost him and I will just have to accept that and when I see him in a few weeks, I'll say hi then and then run away. There's nothing there..why should either of us pretend that there is?

"event","What's the point of talking to someone who just isn't going to respond back? I need to quit dreaming that one day he is magically going to change into a conversationalist and move on instead of making myself look like a fool by talking to a brick wall. So, I should have done this a long time ago. If I write in the journal, then, no one can respond, therefore, I expect no one to respond. And my feelings are not hurt, because of mindless dreaming for things that are never going to come true. I've recently purchased the book, ""He's just not that into you."" I can't wait to start reading it, and hope it gets here soon. But I think I'm also beginning to realize. I'm just not that into him, at least not anymore. It gets old hearing myself talk all the time. It gets old talking about the same stuff all the time. I need spontaneity or some sense of a pulse. Some people are very dull, and those people are just not for me. I think I fall into ""like"" too quickly. I need to work on rushing into an emotional relationship with people. Perhaps, it'd be easier for me to form friendships with those people if I wasn't always looking for ""the one."" Perhaps, I need to let go of my fear or worry of loneliness, and just let ""Jesus take the wheel."" I love listening to song lyrics to get a feel for what life is like and there are some that I agree with and some that I don't. Like the old Switchfoot song, ""It's your life. Are you who you want to be?"" I don't think that's a good way to look at it. I think it should say, ""Are you who God wants for you to be?"" However, I love the lyrics of the song ""What if his people prayed?"" by the Casting Crowns. Part of it says, ""Stop asking Oprah what to do"". I love that line. So, basically, turn your eyes upon Jesus. Let Jesus take the wheel. God is our comforter(our blanket;)) And say, so long self, it's been fun, but I gotta make room for God, which means you have to go. And so does everything else that's holding me back from being what God wants me to be and doing what God wants me to do. Now, God is great, but we have to be patient and realize that it's going to take time for him to answer our prayers, but when it happens, you will know, and it will be a perfect day."

"event","So, school this semester is not quite what I had imagined, at least not thus far. Taking three math classes led me to conclude that I should have multitudes of homework grating my every nerve and leading me to many sleepless nights. However, I seem to have been mistaken. I have had one homework assignment, which consisted of three problems, and then the teacher did not even collect it. Now I've been thinking about life and how I just adore meeting new people and doing new interesting things, so that is what I will do. I'm tired of the friends that call you a friend in front of you, but all talk crap about you behind your back. I mean, isn't that something you do when you're in elementary or middle school? I thought this was college, a time to grow up and leave all the petty chatter behind. Also, by growing up, I don't mean, exploring your body with a choice(or lack thereof) member of the opposite sex. Whatever happened to chivalry and modesty? I know, females became powerful and with that power, they wanted to be able to be sexually rampageous like men. To do this, they became easy and whorish. Now, don't get me wrong, prostitution was the first occupation in America, but it seems in the modern world, it's men doing the prostitution, because all females want is sex. When I have sex, I want a nice diamond on my left hand, to prove to the world that I am the only girl for him and he the only man for me. I mean, even after 10 months of dating, I wouldn't even consider it. If he loves me and believes I am the girl for him, he will wait until we are married. Oh well. Times are rough and times are tough. We will all get through.

I truly think this is the summer of sixty nine. I heard the song all the time while I was in Germany at the beginning of this summer. This has been one of the best of all time. I mean, everything seems so different. Even me, I feel like I have almost gotten preppier or something. It's weird to look at a picture of myself and tell myself I look pretty, and for once, I believe it. This picture was just taken like two years ago. I've learned to love myself and that's foremost what I have to do. I can still be my happy self, but I have to mature into a happy down-to-earth creature that just loves life and everything about it. It's really weird that once I was considering suicide. It's really weird that I took 26 aspirins at one time, but I never gave up. I was too good to die young. I set personal goals and I accomplished them. Not many students can say they had perfect attendance for 10 years straight. I feel accomplished just in that. When we all came back from Germany, we knew we had all changed, and with that change, we became better friends and had inside jokes and realized just how much we all had in common. Then, camping. It was totally fun, despite the rain. I got to hang out with some of my most favorite people in the world. Now, I have a job. I don't like it too much, but I have learned a lot. My boss has a nearly eighteen year old son. I am honored that she wants to introduce me to him, because that says a lot about what she thinks about me in the short time that I have worked at the Family Dollar. She invited me to his eighteenth birthday party. That'll be a little odd, but who knows? Anyway, that makes it sleeping time. I've got a lot of things to do tomorrow. Shopping with Emily. Then picnic and movie with Brady!

That's about 33 hours!!! Work sucks, could ya tell? Yeah..Packed yet? No. Started packing yet?? No! Slammed my finger in the car door today. Ran outta gas at tenth and Ritter. Went to Church. Yesterday, went to see ""The Village"" with Gabe and Emily. Have fantasy football draft tonite at 10:15 p.m. Gonna get Peyton, Mikey, Edge then everyone else. Just hope to get those three. The next 13 days will be the longest thirteen days of my life and God knows it will talk all the strength in the world to pull through, but what does not kill can only make me stronger. Yes, friends will be missed, but cell phones are a wonderful invention and visiting friends' schools is never discouraged. WC's football team will still kick butt. Nothing will change. We will all have croquet, the portal to fun hell, and ""It's bound to be fun and fun to be bound."" We'll remember pizzle, nipples, and Joe being a flaming homophobic ho, but we still love him. Lozano, ""I'll dismember you,"" choir drama, chiasmus, synecdoche. Gabe and his corny jokes. Me and my horribly disgusting jokes. Emily and her pirate infatuation. Ashley and her consistent breaking of the dress code. Taryn and her valedictorian speech. Mike always complaining about how ugly he is when he's not. Kenny, being uber-quiet. Gail, who always liked John, but never did anything about it. John, who was really tall, but afraid of a distance relationship. Samara, who always had issues keeping her loves in town. The pink physics shirts. Stats and the stats t-shirts. Lo! Fat Ho! Lo-Fat Ho. What goes ha ha ha plop. Strip bowling. Padiddle. The Hypothetical husbands and wives, children-legit and illegitimate. Mike's wrestling drama. Ashley, Emily and my choir drama. NHS stuff. The Gabe. Trish. Football season. Show choir season. Croquet and burning at pre-open house. Our senior class president.

How things go with KG every day is how I feel my entire day went. Yesterday, I thought things with him went very well, so of course I was thinking it was a great day and I still think that. But today, I didn't connect with him in the same way when I was trying to talk to him. So, I felt bad the whole rest of the day. I feel sick to my stomach, and I have a headache. However, in choir, Dr. B was as awesome if not more than I thought he would be. I love performing for great people, because it encourages me to be great. Another awesome thing is what Mrs. Clift said, ""Hi-Lites and Connection sound the best I have heard in the past 5 years."" How is that for awesome? Now, if we could get our choreography and outfits and stuff, I think we'll be fine. Actually, I'm only worried about the choreography for the closer. Everything else will meld together.

"event","Today really wasn't that interesting, but I might as well share. I went dumb over the weekend, and totally forget everything I was supposed to do. I forget to type the German paper, and I forgot to do my Calculus. Of course, as a true procrastinator, everything got done before the class began. Many kids in my third hour class, Hi-Lites, probably didn't like what Mrs. Simpson said, but I agreed with every word of it. I am beginning to get really sick of all the crazy little attitudes in there. We're a team, and if we want to be good we have to rehearse. Is that too hard to comprehend? Anyway, English was awesome!! I am a senior in high school and we are having a Valentine's Day Party!! IN English class! My teacher was totally psycho crazy OCD kinna thing first semester, but I think she's on some sort of happy pill and it rocks!!! We get to decorate the little bags and take a class list home and make a valentine for everyone so that people don't feel left out! We're even making one for the little girl that brings messages to our class every day! We get to eat candy and cupcakes:) After school, we rehearsed with the BAND for the first time and it rocked!! I love our band, but then again, everyone does. They make our show soo much better. They rock our closer, and God knows our closer needed some rockin'. 
Well, I have painted my nails a bright red color and I love to look at them! My hair still needs some work, but I'll get that in the morning. Oh, and I found my shoes! Life is pretty good. I'll be back tomorrow!
~Smiles for all..

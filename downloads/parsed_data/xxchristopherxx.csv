"event","well, this kid i work with at guitar center doesnt like me because i have better social skills than he does and i know way more about our department than he does... (and i think he is a fucking asshole) but anyway, he told nate yesterday that he wanted to punch me in the face because i wouldnt repair one of his costumers guitars for him: 1. because he didnt know how to do it and 2. because it was a big repair (shaving down the nut) and we have a fucking repair guy who comes in on wednesday, who fucking rules, and I'm not going to ""steal"" business from a dude i like.

so the bottom line is, i really like guitar center, with the exception of this one fucking pathetic pile of shit, and his genital warts.

i will either just let him hang himself by talking shit to a bunch of dudes that like me, or i will punch out, and then punch him out.

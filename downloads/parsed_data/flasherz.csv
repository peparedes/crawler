"event","Spent the day out in the shop with Alex, building his pinewood derby car.  Last year it was a simple wedge with steering wheel; this year Alex wanted a pencil-shaped car.  I started with the major cuts on the bandsaw (although Alex helped push the wood through it) and then turned him loose with the multi-tool and a bunch of sandpaper.  We finished the night by applying the pencil's body coat.  Tomorrow we'll be adding the tin to simulate the eraser holder, and painting the eraser and graphite.

A few interesting NFL match-ups for tomorrow -- it would be good to see the Cardinals make it for the first time in many years.  Then again, I still have some reservations about the ownership family and the way they handle the team (and some bitterness from losing the football Cardinals some 25ish years ago).

Unions need to get realistic about the long-term prospects of trying to get more and more money for the same job that can be performed offshore for 1/10th the cost; management structure of the company needs to be re-tooled for today's reality."

Why can't our educators simply admit when they've over-reacted?            
                                                                                
I live near the Mascoutah, IL school district where the principal & superintendent attempted to defend suspending a student for hugging another student after receiving high marks on a test.                           
                                                                                
Now this administrator defends her lack of judgment with:  ""The student was suspended for one day for inappropriate behavior in the classroom. The suspension was warranted.""

Nowhere does she talk about any intent -- that the student was threatening other children, or using it in a menacing or disruptive way.  No, the mere possession of a blade found in a pencil sharpener was enough to use the second most disruptive punishment available to an administrator...
                                                                                
If you want to know who is responsible for all the violence in this country, educators should look in the mirror!  After all, if they're willing to suspend a student (considered a VERY harsh penalty when I went to school 20 years ago) for having a broken pencil sharpener or hugging a student, then why shouldn't a child stab a friend for calling him names?  Or killing a dog because it barked?                                                

Is it that educators have become so lazy that they don't want to bother with considering intent, that they just want something as simple as zero-tolerance?

Is it the fear of lawsuits?  Or is it just apathy from an aging teaching force, swept up in tenure and automatic raises from the union?                                            
                                                                                
We should be teaching children to admit their mistakes; that we shouldn't go overboard.  THAT is their responsibility.  Own up to it, admit the mistake, learn from it, and move on.                                                     
                                                                                
I've recognized that cynicism and arrogance are common traits in many school administrators, especially those in the public school system.  It's time for that to change."

Simply put, there should not be a bail-out of mortgage investors OR mortgage lenders by our government for gross negligence and stupidity on either part.  Why should I pay for others' stupidity too, when much of our government already has that market cornered in abusive tax-and-spend wealth redistribution?

I don't understand how anyone can possibly say the government should bail out someone so stupid enough to get an interest-only, negative-amortization, or short-term adjustable rate loan without considering what happens when a) interest rates soar or b) the value of the investment goes down.  If you're too young to know, read a history book or ask your parents - it was less than 20 years ago when we had interest rates in the mid-teens!

We don't bail out investors when the stock market falls significantly and margin calls come in, so we shouldn't bail out people who do the same hedging on real estate.  I don't care if the homeowners lose their primary residence to foreclosure; they were the ones who didn't think about what would happen in a bumpy market.  They over-extended their credit and took on the risk of very high LTV ratios.

If homeowners are indeed unknowing of those risks, then they should be renting because they've clearly not understood what it means to be a homeowner."

The improvement has been tremendous.  He just finished 1.5 oz of breast milk and 1.5 oz of formula and spent 45 minutes awake with me -- just a few days ago he wouldn't eat more than a teaspoon and was sleeping nearly 24 hours a day...  I'm very excited!

There are a couple of tests outstanding -- day 2 of blood & spinal fluid cultures need to come back (day 1 was clear, so there's a minimal chance of something growing in day 2), and they're awaiting the virus tests they're doing.  The initial blood tests showed a slightly high monocyte count, meaning he might be fighting a viral infection.

Aidan's energy level still seems relatively low.  Yesterday, the doctors ordered a battery of tests -- chest x-ray and urine, blood, & spinal fluid panels & cultures -- to rule out a bacterial infection.  Last night, they took a few nose swabs to do some viral testing.  The chest x-ray had to be retaken last night because they found a ""haze"" in the abdoment area on the initial x-ray (heart & lungs looking good).  It may have been the result of him moving during the x-ray; if not, more tests will be needed.

Yesterday afternoon we heard the urine screen came back clean; we're waiting for the doctors to visit this morning so we can get the results of the blood panels & cultures and chest x-ray.  We're in here until tomorrow at least, for the results of the spinal fluid culture.

I'm also a bit concerned that Aidan's heart rate is hanging around 155 at rest and will regularly go to 165-180 when he gets agitated...  apparently (via doc) this is normal for a very agitated baby his age -- to make matters worse they had the monitor configured for a toddler...

"event","I've long said that the insurance companies are the primary reason that the medical care system in the United States is seriously messed up.

I will make it very clear, though, before some of you folks begin spewing the crap about government owned-and-operated, socialist medical care:  THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER EITHER.  Socialized medical care is even more inefficient and merely substitutes one problem with bureaucratic inefficiency (and ultimately costs the average person *more* through hidden taxes).

<lj-cut text=""Exhibit A:  my wife's recent hospital bill..."">
<img src=""http://users.pentics.com/chuegen/misc/del/bill.jpg""><p>
Note the bill.  You'll see charges for $12,218.12 from the hospital.  You'll see that the insurance company paid $3,400, and that I owe $100.  You'll also see that the hospital's contract with the insurance company requires them to give a discount of EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND TWELVE CENTS, or 71%+, to the insurance company.  To get $3,500, providers must bill for $12,000.  If they needed $20,000, they'd have to bill the insurance company $60,000.

Now, that's not really a problem until you consider that there are laws preventing providers from charging insurance companies different prices than uninsured private citizens.  This means that if we didn't have insurance, we'd have to pay the FULL $12,218.12.

Now, that's a pretty untenable position to be in, so the providers have to set up charities to handle the ""discounts"" to the poorest private citizens that they're forced to give to insurance companies.  In this case, should we meet qualification guidelines and not have insurance, we might get $8000 from the charity.  Who gave the money to the charity?  The hospital, as a donation write-off.

But we don't qualify for those charities.  So if we weren't insured, we'd be paying that FULL amount.  Only the poorest of individuals get the discounts -- everyone else is *forced* to have some sort of insurance.

Some of the therapists that we dealt with for Alex's speech expressed the same concerns to us...  they couldn't give us a ""cash"" price for therapy because it was illegal for them to charge me less than they charge the insurance company.  Let's say that one of them looked to get $70/hour for therapy...  he told me that he had to charge me $150, because when he charged the insurance company $150 he received the $70.  He didn't have a charity set up to write off the extra amount.  Why should I have to pay $150 if he only wants $70 but can't charge me $70 without breaking the law?
</lj-cut>

This crap is out of control.  It's time to restore insurance to what it is supposed to be:  a safety blanket in case of major issues.  I'm a major supporter of preventative healthcare allowances, returning insurance to a back-up role."

2. People who, tasked wit hthe responsibility of raising and/or lowering the flag representing our country, purposely allow the flag to touch the ground or floor.  It makes me more angry when that person is what appears to be an illegal immigrant.

3. Finally, those who don't stop and pull over for emergency vehicles travelling in ANY direction.  Today there was a fairly serious fire (drawing 4 fire departments & 10 response vehicles).

"event","...the most classless quarterback in NFL history.

Sure, he might get the other record you're all thinking of (for the most touchdowns in one season), but one can hardly say that he really achieved that record with class.  It's one thing to do it with true sportsmanship, it's another to do it through abusing your opponents.

Most coaches respect the notion of ""garbage time"" -- as Tony Dungy did a number of years ago -- where the primary players are pulled after the game is far out of reach.  When Peyton Manning beat Dan Marino's record a few years ago, it was done with Dungy pulling him out frequently (after the Colts had gone up by at least 28 or so).  Brady begs Belichick to keep him in, Belichick obliges -- I suppose it's his only way of stealing yet more attention.

Belichick, of course, has zero class or respect for sportsmanship...  If the game is 52-0, Belichick will still keep Brady in.

Some might say Brady's already set the record for most classless QB in history.  Belichick sewed the classless coach record up long, long ago.  I'm disappointed that anyone could have respect for such an ass."

"event","Some of you may be aware that my wife <lj user=""computerblonde""> and I are expecting another little one, due in May 2008.  As with our other little one (""Beet""), she once again has been showing the symptoms of <a href=""http://www.helpher.org/"">Hyperemesis Gravidarum</A> (""HG""), except a bit worse this time.  Just as a quick primer, HG for my wife means vomiting 8-12 times a day from 3-5 weeks through delivery (usually at 40 weeks).

<lj-cut text=""The details...  suffice it to say I'm preparing for a second career in nursing."">

Last time, she could keep down canned peaches (in heavy syrup) and some liquids, but very little other foods.  This time, unfortunately, we aren't as lucky...  while she can eat food and keep it down for a while, her progesterone levels are leaving food unprocessed in her stomach, only to come up 2-10 hours later.  Liquids make her vomit within 15-30 minutes, even basic water.  Any smells can make her vomit -- mostly, food smells but also natural body smells, perspiration, perfumes, etc.  Some nights I can't sleep in the same room; sometimes the kids aren't allowed near her.  Food prep for the boys has to be done far away from her, and even then it sometimes drifts and causes adverse reactions.

At about 7 weeks, her OB sent her for IV fluids at the hospital for dehydration and set us up with home healthcare.  Home healthcare (Matria) supplied her with a subcutaneous infusion pump with Zofran, a very expensive anti-nausea medication typically used for reducing the effects of chemotherapy.  While this reduced the nausea, it still didn't eliminate very much of the vomiting and she still hasn't been able to eat or drink.

Last week, for the fourth time this pregnancy, she needed IV fluids.  The home healthcare nurse tried unsuccessfully 5 times to start the IV, and we headed to the ER / labor & delivery.  They were able to put in an IV for 2 liters, but only as a temporary measure.  The next day, her doctor ordered <A HREF=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_parenteral_nutrition"">TPN</A>, nutrients & vitamins fed via pump through a central catheter running in a vein from her arm to just above her heart.

This is difficult for both her and I (her significantly moreso than I).  It means that in addition to the Zofran pump (which has its own pump, tubing, & catheter), she has another tube, pump, & backpack with 3 liters of liquid when full.  If the tube gets caught on something, or one of the boys gets a hold of it, it could pull the catheter out.  The risk of infection is significant.  On a weekly basis, the dressing must be changed in a near-sterile environment by a visiting nurse.

On a daily basis, we have to prepare her next day's TPN:

1.  It must be pulled out of the refrigerator 2 hours before the last bag is due to run out.
2.  2 vials of Pepcid and 2 vials of vitamins must be cleaned, a new syringe and 23 ga. needle assembled, and the liquids injected into the new TPN bag, and associated appropriate disposal
3.  At time to change bag, we clamp and disconnect the old bag from PICC line #1, remove it from the pump and dispose of it all
4.  We clean & flush PICC lines 1 & 2 with alcohol wipes & 10 ml of saline flush (or 5 ml saline + Heparin)
5.  We put new batteries in the pump, clean the PICC connector with alcohol again, and attach the new TPN bag, and start the program for 24 hours

Every week she has an OB appointment (sometimes twice a week).  She gets a blood draw on Monday, test results go to the doctor & pharmacist on Tuesday morning, and TPN is formulated on Tuesday afternoon for courier delivery to our house, where it must be put into the refrigerator.  We review the orders for any changes to vitamins, etc. and repeat the process for the week.

At least she is fairly mobile -- she has a backpack to carry the stuff around.  Unfortunately, she is on another anti-nausea medication, Phenergan, that has a side effect of exhaustion.  After spending only 3 1/2 hours out with us, she was so physically exhausted that she vomited and slept from 11 pm to 2 pm the next day.

Baths are tough, we have to wrap her arm in cling wrap and tape it up -- keeping her left arm out of the water.  It means she needs help with shampooing hair and some cleaning (it's very difficult and nearly impossible to clean your right armpit with only your right arm, for example -- much less shave it!)

...all of this, and it still doesn't stop the vomiting...  remember to grab both bags & pumps on your way running to the toilet!

It also means that she can't do much around the house, either due to physical limitations (can't lift more than 10 lbs. with her left arm where the PICC line is located) or exhaustion.  I take care of what I can...  I get the boys up and ready for school/daycare, feed them breakfast, shoo them off, do my normal day job, pick up Beet from daycare, prepare dinner, get dishes done, get the boys ready for bed, tuck them in, get some laundry done or another odd job, then go to bed myself and repeat.  We have someone coming 2-3 times per week to do cleaning and some odd jobs for us, and some others have been kind enough to prepare food and bring it to us so that all we have to do is warm it up for the boys & me.  She is exhausted, I am exhausted, and we get little time to spend with the young ones...

One of the few things that she can drink -- sometimes keeping it down -- is a frozen soda.  I purchased a used Taylor machine from an Ohio gas station that was upgrading from a 2-flavor to a 4-flavor unit:

<img src=""http://gallery.pentics.com/d/23202-2/IMG_1055.JPG"">
</lj-cut>

This is not only physically taxing on her, but also emotionally & psychologically as well.  Her body *wants* her to eat and drink -- she feels hunger & thirst pains.  It's extremely difficult forcing yourself to eat or drink knowing that you'll be retching in front of a toilet within a short period of time.  I don't envy her.  I try to support her the best way I can -- try to support us all and keep life moving along, but some things fall by the wayside -- our pool is still open, the house is a mess, the Halloween decorations just came down last week, etc.  There are sometimes I do really stupid stuff and talk about something that triggers her nausea.  Mostly, we're holding it together.

23 more weeks to go...  please send some kind thoughts, prayers, etc. our way.

<B>EDIT:</B>  My wife reminded me that I had neglected to mention how the baby's doing -- we had an ultrasound done a few weeks ago and got to see the baby doing a dance in mommy's uterus:

I'm taking her to surgery tomorrow morning (Tuesday) to put the line in.
All should go well tomorrow and it's a pretty common procedure, relatively speaking.  There is a risk of infection, though, in some cases.

This pregnancy is different from our other one in that during his, at least she could keep some liquids down.  This time, no luck -- most liquids last no longer than 5-10 minutes.  Her high progesterone levels are preventing her stomach from digesting food quickly, and Reglan (a drug that tries to speed it up) just makes her throw up even more.

Subject: Thank you for making a laughingstock of our communities                
                                                                                
                                                                                
Dear Mr. Stone,                                                                 
                                                                                
I must say that I am absolutely appalled that common sense and reason have      
been thrown out the window yet again in favor of liberal political              
correctness and fear of sexual harrassment lawsuits.                            
                                                                                
Having grown up in Clinton County and having spent 6 years living in            
liberal northern California before moving back, I had hope that our             
midwestern communities were more personable and cared more about                
developing the closer ties that characterize the friendly people of             
the midwest.                                                                    
                                                                                
Imagine my horror when I heard Dr. McGowen on KMOX explaining how               
a hug caused a detention, and threats of suspension for a student.              
                                                                                
Then, imagine my laughs at the hypocrisy as Dr. McGowen tried to                
explain how football players hugging each other would be okay on                
school property because it was a game, but students hugging to                  
celebrate passing a tough examination (the very reason they are                 
in the school) would be the functional equivalent of sexual                     
intercourse in school for the purpose of your policy.                           
                                                                                
Finally, imagine my outrage as I read that not only did you ask                 
KSDK to leave a public place paid for by taxpayers' dollars, but you            
called police to have them escorted.                                            
                                                                                
You, sir, and Dr. McGowen don't belong in our communities.                      
To hear Dr. McGowen's self-righteousness (""I've been a good administrator       
for 30 plus years"") on KMOX is appalling, and your actions are twice            
as appalling.  You obviously believe that every school district should          
be turned into a politically correct, sanitized zone where students are         
discouraged from developing interpersonal relationships in favor of             
keeping arms' length from anyone for fear that they may offend others.          
                                                                                
This type of response is the very reason that society is rapidly                
degrading.  I thought this area of the country would be one of the last         
hopes for teaching interpersonal relationships instead of promoting             
isolation and fear to human beings.  I'm sorry I was wrong,                     
and I'm very sorry for the parents and students of your school district.        
                                                                                
Sincerely,

In case you didn't hear it (read the link above), Bob Kraft's son went running to the NFL after the game, complaining that the audio carry-overs in the TV CBS feed were proof of the long-time urban legend that the Colts pipe in crowd noise and that the CD was skipping.                                                   
                                                                                
I heard the same audio carry-overs during the broadcast, but they were complete carry-overs that affected the ENTIRE audio stream.  If it were a combination of piped-in crowd noise and the local crowd's cheering, you'd hear only a diminished volume of skipping along with live noise, not the entire audio track being carried over.                                                                 
                                                                                
It only goes to show that New England's lack of class continues to dig further and further into the basement, from the players to Belichick to the ownership of the club.  Shame on you, Kraft, Belichick, and team!"

"event","For a very long time in my life I had long hair. As a young girl I obviously had long hair, mostly because my poor father was very good with his own hair, but rather at a loss of what to do with mine. Besides, all small girls like to have long hair.

When I was taken from him, I was taken from a world of care too. Slaves who are not chosen for... sexual nature, are not visually important. Washing and grooming was essentially unknown to me, and so my hair grew, split and stayed long and greasy for a good many years. 

After all that was over, at some point during my therapy with Sheridon... or perhaps not actually at a session, he said that I was carrying around too much of the past and perhaps should make a symbolic move towards the future. I suppose that is why I cut my hair, in an effort to do as he wanted and to move myself forward. I still kept a little length in the front so I could use barrettes and bows and feel pretty.

Now I have my own daughter, and she wants her hair long. Every morning she comes into my room and sits and purrs (loudly) while I brush her and then we play hair-dresser and see what style she wants that day. She doesn't care for the dresses I put her in, but she loves playing with her hair, or my hair.

I suppose I am wondering if I should change my hair. I am no longer a little girl, or a slave... but I am no longer trying to... move forward... I am a mother now and a wife. 

Mew... I don't know."

She can also stand now, but she's scared of walking. We try and trick her into it, but she only takes half a step before she decides she'd rather get on her knees.

She likes sardines crushed in potatoes and milk. We found this out at a picnic we had under some cherry blossom trees. She had fun chasing the blossom around.

Her hair is starting to get bits of red in it, as well as black... which doesn't make much sense to me... I don't have red colouring, and Von doesn't... but it's very cute.

I do not know what to say.

He was an angry aggressive thing, but when you show something nothing but hatred, what else can it grow up to be? 

I do not believe he knew what to do with the freedom he finally spent his whole life longing for... but I hope in some way, underneath his complaints and growls that he enjoyed these last few years in some way.

He was a hero to me, even when I thought he was foolish. I will never forget the day I had to clean him and offered him an end to it all, how strong he was, how he refused. I can only hope to be like him one day.

He was a legend while he lived in that house, even while we all thought him stupid for it. Through Taeo I learnt Tipol was a legend elsewhere too, his story spread. It won't die with him, I am very sure of that. His life inspired others too, I hope.

He and his family are together now. I hope.

Shrikari came to see me yesterday. She had a long talk with me about her Soul Modification - things she said that other people wouldn't warn about. She kept patting my hand and telling me it was painful and that she was worried about me... because I'm... er... 'such a little doll'. I did not really have the heart to tell her that I've been through a lot of pain before... She looks so good. I cannot explain it. She did not seem <I>old</i> before, but now she seems... young. Different. Her eyes are... brighter, more youthful. She told me herself she felt new. Like some weight she hadn't noticed before was suddenly gone. - I can't help thinking that it would be nice for Tipol to feel that way.

Tipol was not my other visitor. Taeo was. He wanted to look around Von's kitchen now I have.... reorganised it... and taste the food I've been cooking of course. I have missed him so much. It was nice to see him and curl up with him. I do not know if he's forgetful, or told not to talk about it, but he didn't ask any questions so... it was nice just to see him.

Worse things have happened to others, and they've gotten up again, so I can only follow their example.

It is not really a moment too soon, as I do want to be at Shrikari and Memory Keeper Judas' wedding, even if it is just for a moment. I am worried too many people will panic me... but I do want to show my face at the event when it happens.

My own wedding... I think Von and I will wait a little longer. It has not really been discussed since so much has happened, but we cannot have it until after my soul mod... and I cannot have that until The Four allow me. 

I think I live with Von now, in his library. There were not really any plans for that until after the wedding either, but since... I just do not wish to return to the house again. Then again, perhaps I do not... Von, you do not mind my moving in?

"event","I think I have finally stopped shaking from my meeting at the weekend. At the very least, my hair and fur seems a more normal volume now. The metting did go well, and the soul modification was approved, but it was still very frightening. 

Even if I have stood there before, for other reasons, it's <I>The Four</i> you're standing in front of. As well as The Reaper, and although I live in his home for several years now, I still feel very far below his stature.

The meeting felt oddly emotional, even behind my nerves. There was a lot of going through my lifetime, judging me. It was odd, in some 58 years there has been a lot that happened to me, but not a lot I seem to have done. I thought 58 years was a long time, but hearing it summed up in a few words - and preparing to live forever - it seems very short. They seemed to think I coped well with my lifetime, I am unsure if I really agree with that but it is very complimentary.

There was also of course, talk of a few events in Von's life... which was actually quite fun. I enjoyed the learning.

So... they will get back to me with the date of my Soul Modification.

Although I said earlier I did not seem to have done a lot in my lifetime, I know that during my years of freedom I have tried to do some things. I learnt Mortal-Realm English, for example, simply because I liked the strange rules around it, the irregularities and things like that. I like Earth-English, and the people's customs are also interesting and cute.

Which leads me to today, which is Valentine's day in the Mortal-Realm calendar... so I would just like to wish my future-husband* a happy Valentine's day... and a few other things... which I will tell you in private.

<U><B>Memory Meme</u></b> <lj-cut>

<B>What is your earliest memory?</b> My earliest memory is when I was taken to town. While we shopped for food, I saw a stall with ribbons and buttons. I'd been good, so my father bought me a pinkish ribbon and tied it into my hair. I found some string on the ground and spent what felt like hours trying to tie it into his hair in as pretty a bow as I had.

<B>What is the most recent thing you remember?</b> Noticing that Chirps and Feathers baby is getting very big and she should have a name of some kind.

<B>What is your happiest memory?</b> Hearing that Baern was alive again. I have only heard this through the grapevine, apparently he is very important now. It was a big shock that he was alive again, but it was certainly a wonderful thing to have a friend back, especially after the stories of how horribly he died.

<B>What is your saddest memory?</b> Finding out my father was dead. I should have expected I would not see him again, but I had a lot of hope that as I was finally freed, I'd find him again. It was just the most shattering thing in the world to me to hear he had died five years before I was freed.

<B>What is your most painful memory?</b> All of my most recent slaving is horrible to remember. It hurts me so much to remember what Taeo had to go through, and imagine what he went through before. It upsets me so much that Fiore had to realise that way what so many of his kind go throug. All those memories and the things they said and did to me just hurt me physically when I think of them.

<B>What is your most treasured memory?</b> Helping my father make my fifth birthday cake. We got more mix on each other than in the bowl, and while he was mixing up a fresh batch, I stole the butter and icing-sugar mix and hide under the table and ate it all. I did have an awful stomach ache that night, but he let me sleep with him and didn't scold me. He just rubbed my stomach all night. He was a good father.

<B>What is your most serious memory?</b> Oddly enough, it involves Sheridon. He could be serious, or else he would not be a very good psychaitrist. I can't really remember much, but I remember him holding my face and making me look at him and he told me... a lot of things. Like that I was a good person and I had rights and things like that. It was an oddly heavy moment I seem to recall. I think a week or two later he told me he loved me.

<B>What is your silliest memory?</b> I remember being very small and creeping into my father's room. I cannot remember why, I think I was scared, but I remember him looking over the side of the bed at me, and his hair wasn't treated so it was flat and floppy and he looked at me sleepily and... he didn't seem like <I>my</i> father, so I thought I had come into the wrong room. So we were trapped like that a short while, him asking what I wanted and me asking who he was. Eventually I got cuddles, though.

<B>What is your sexiest memory?</b> Um... Von came to see me and he was just leaning in my doorway and smiling with a present for me, and he said ""hello, baby""... and it was really sexy. I don't know why, it was just him, and he's... sexy.

<B>What is your most embarrassing memory? Do you wish you could forget it?</b> If I am allowed this, it's probably admitting the above memory. I do not like having to publically talk about sexual things, even just things I find sexy.

<B>What is your most vivid memory?</b> It is not a pleasent memory to admit, but it was the first time those recent slavers raped me. I would not like to go into detail with that memory, but I remember it very, very graphically.

<B>Do you have a good memory?</b> I think I have a fair memory.

<B>Do your memories affect how you are as a person?</b> I don't know

<B>Do you consider memory a blessing or a curse?</b> I think it must be a blessing.

<B>Do you use any aids to help you remember things (scrapbooks, bus passes, etc)?</b> I did just try and think back on the good things and try to keep them fresh in my mind. I did not have many keepsakes for much of my life, so this was the only way I could remember things.</lj-cut>


My, my father features quite a lot in my memories. Perhaps Sheridon was right when he said no one will ever compare to him in my life."

"event","I must have been in this world a year now, if not a little over...

It seems to have gone so slowly. Most people talk of time flying and passing by in a blur, but everything in that year has been so slow and almost grinding at times. So much has happened in that time though - however long or short it may have been.

I do not know what I was expecting when I came here, but it certainly wasn't everything that has happened to me. Some was very nice, and some was horrible... but I have made a great many friends and I am very happy at this moment in my life.

I would like to see what the next year brings."

"event","I was able to go out a few days ago, to a beach not in this world, but it was very nice to get out of the house. It was a lot of fun to just nap in the sun and walk along the shoreline.

I think I caught the sun on my face, I have permanent apple-cheeks.

However, the best part was not the trip out, although I did very much enjoy it and I am very grateful for it. Nor was it the sunhat I was bought, although again I like it very much and am eternally grateful again. The best part I think was just... when Von said hello. Just because he was there and he had come to see me, I felt so very overwhelmingly happy.

But I do not think I could ever tell him that in words, so I have had to take a while to try and write it here, but even then it is very difficult for me. My father, Sheridon and Baern have all said in the past that I am very distant at times, so I suppose that is why it is so difficult for me; but I would like Von to know that when he smiled at me and called me 'baby' and said hello that I just felt... happy."

I feel guilty that the most expensive things he gave me to remember him are long gone... and when I was dusting my shelves today I found all the books he gave me and it did hurt a lot. I don't know how much time I lost to tears then...

But I hope he is watching over everyone, especially his unborn baby and partner. I'm sure he is...

I never thought I would outlive any of my post-freedom partners."

I really did not think that I would be a pet person, but now I seem to have three birds in my care.

"event","I dreamt of my father last night - it was really a dream. I cannot explain why sometimes I feel my dreams about him are not... as they seem, but they feel different to me. Last night was a dream, I am sure of it, but it made me wonder if I am trying hard enough. I hope I am making him proud of me.

There was something in my paper journal from April which I thought I should publically post. I feel it will not.. have relevance if I do not share it. Regardless of how I know many will think less of me for it.

<blockquote>23rd April:

I know now that I was in a better situation the first time I was slaved. The first time we were all fed regularly and we were allowed the company of the other slaves. We slaves banded together, we were a family; sisters, brothers, lovers... it was a nice atmosphere in the horror and I did not realise at the time how lucky I was to have those things. The recent slaving... the other slaves were cruel to each other, they were all... divided, trying to climb on each other's back to get to the sun.

I remember one time when in the house, the first time... I broke a plate and other slaves crowded around me to try and confuse the slavers. I know if I had done something to cause a lot of trouble in the last slave market then no one would have stood by to help me. No one would have comforted me after a beating either - except of course, Taeo and Fiore.

Regardless... I forgive everyone. I hold no ill will to any of those who slaved me, either time. I do not blame the other Felinoids for how they acted, because I can understand their fear although it frightens me that they would be so divided. I pity them... because... although I am very distant, as many have told me, I think... that perhaps one day I will love, and I do love a lot of people like they are my family and I <I>have</i> loved. I pity that these others just... cannot do that, right now and don't seem to have done so for a long time.

I hope that the other slaves, and my slavers find relief in how their lives go now, or in their next lives.</blockquote>

I really do forgive, everyone."

But I should be making more effort, or it would be a great insult to those who looked for us all, so I am trying my best to leave my room. I was writing my thoughts on paper, and I have written them onto this journal now, but I am too embarrassed to share that publically...

I am having a hard time calming down from the experience, I apologise for that.

I feel terrible that I have not thanked everyone who helped find us. I cannot do it face-to-face at the moment but I am very grateful for everything everyone did to save Taeo, Fiore and myself.



I think I would like to return to my room now..."

"event","I had a lot of fun today, it must be said. I felt... very relaxed, although there were a few moments when I felt anxious. I think Taeo is feeling much happier from today too, which makes me feel happier as well.

I feel I must have done my father proud today... just because I felt happy. I am glad I do not have a lot of expectations in my life, because it means that everything I do, no matter how small, exceeds them.

Although, I am unsure how I got to this point in life... It seems very strange to me that I should live in close quarters with Forces, and that at least two Memory Keepers consider me a friend. I do not feel I am on the same level as most of the people I know these days, and I wonder why they would want to spend time with me... I hope I do not seem ungrateful through my fears, I am very grateful for everything that had happened to me to allow me to be at this point in my life."

"event","I cannot say that I ever thought about having a brother (or sister)... 

A lot of people I was slaved with became like my older/younger siblings in a lot of ways, but they generally did not survive, or now I am away from them and so cannot see them.

Still, although I never thought of having siblings, I seem to adopt a lot of people in their roles. Even now I seem to feel close to Taeo and Fiore as though they are younger and older brothers, respectively.

I have to hope that I am a passable older sister, especially today."

I also apologise to Memory Keeper Von for taking up his time, although I know it was his own choice to visit and help Taeo and myself while we were ill. I know you must be a very busy person, so thank you again.

I am feeling much better myself, although I will sometimes suffer a fit of sneezing. Poor Taeo is still rather poorly though, so I will be taking care of him today. He must be very sickly if I have to make him eat."

"event","I think that time is a very complicated thing...

If I think about it, Felinoids have a short lifetime. Only around 150 years, but that is 150 First Realm years... which is 500 days long. Which is... 75000(?) days, which is a very long time, to my mind.

But now I am in this World, where time is very different and the years are only... some 300 days long. So... do the years change? Would I live for 150 years of this kind of year? Do you really age by years, or is it days? Would I still add up to the thousands of days - or is it hours you age by?

It is a silly thing to sit and wonder about I suppose. I should just live my life while I have it, be it long or short."

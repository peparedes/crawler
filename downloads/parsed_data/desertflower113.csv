"event","I really do buckle under pressure. :/ i wonder why i didn't during APs...
I was reading the interview that alma made for me and I'm glad that I didn't half-ass it. I've written things that I really believe in and want for myself and others...it keeps your mind on the ball. 
""I"" and ""i"" should not be interchangable...and yet...
i think i'm completely free of an obsession(and no, it's not drugs). freedom=liberation=the ability to move forward. hallelujah. 
I am also glad that I finished the entries on the Dalai Lama. Reading them is like re-living it. 
I haven't talked to Mrs. Burgess in a long time :(
Why does college expect you to PROVE that you've learned everything? Isn't going to class enough for them???
Jolly Ranchers have too much color in them and too much dye too. My tongue feels red and sugary. gross. 
Am i a horrible writer? I didn't think I was until this year. It's funny how college affects one's perception. 
I want water. I want to swim. I want to be able to wake up at 6am and not freak out about finals, turn around, go back to sleep until 8...where I will get out of MY own bed, get the paper, and make tea. mmmm tea.
My roommate has promised me that next semester will be much easier to handle. Hell it better be. 

Other than that, I'm in love with life."

I know I go home almost every weekend but I still miss home. Home is where people care about you, where people have time to spend with you, where people stay up for you when you have too much homework, where you can ask for help and receive it...from parents, from teachers, from friends. I miss friends who I don't get to see, regardless of whether or not I talk to them. I go home, but it's not home. I see people here everyday, but I still miss them.

"event","Note: before you read this, please acknowledge that there are two preceding parts to this final flow of words. (see below)


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><P>The first words out of the Dalai Lama's mouth were, I am a human being.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He is. Moreso than anything I have ever seen before. Today I realized how much it meant to me to go see him. </P>
<P>The topic was, once again, finding peace in a world of violence. According to him, the fact that we even address this topic means we need peace. If you're not hungry, you don't need food. If you're not starving, you don't&nbsp;demand it. Therefore, there is some truth to our need ing peace more than ever, because as a global society, it's something that is constantly on our minds.</P>
<P>He stressed compassion. I said this already, but compassion is what leads to internal disarmament. With compassion, our state of mind is more even. It's like when we have a strong immune system, little things don't bother us. The thing doesn't even have to be little. The stronger and healthier our state of mind, the greater we are able to handle irritants, because frankly that's all they are. As human beings, we have the ability to get over things and to move on. I think it's one of the greatest gifts, and for this reason there is progress. We look at things as challenges...disturbances in our life should only be minor, an insignificant bump in the road. </P>
<P>When internally disarming ourselves, what are we disarming? Anger. (yet again yoda comes to mind). All of the wars in this world are an outcome of anger...which is only possible if one is focused on only one cause and blind to the rest. Then we feel we can destroy the cause of whatever makes us angry. But in reality, it's a monster which only consumes us. If your neighbor hated you, and you were mad at your neighbor, and decided to remain in the house, not go out, be mean to friends...you've lost your support, you've given in to your anger, and most of all, you've hurt yourself and have made things easier for your enemies. When an individual feels anger, he mistrusts everything and everyone. You <STRONG><U>cannot </U></STRONG>have real friends if you mistrust them. All around you will be suspiscion, which will only increase other's suspiscion of you...leading to a vicious cycle. If you have real friends, who you are compassionate about...who care about you (which can only happen when you are generous with your kindness) you will be a happier person...</P>
<P>Suspicion is the cause of fear and anger. It is not society that affects an individual, it is the individual that affects society. We cannot allow for this suspicion to continue. If it does, there is no point in external disarmament. </P>
<P>Yes, external disarmament deals with nukes, weaponry, etc. But if we are open to dialogue...</P>
<P>Conflicts occur. The Dalai Lama said that... of course, conflicts will occur. (All it needed was a ""duh"") We're human. It's what we do. But if we are open to resolving conflicts with dialogue...progress will be much easier.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of defenses. Long term and short term. In the short term, we can sheild ourselves, have a strong defense...and if we must...have a strong offense. It is necessary. But this does not look at the cause...correction: causes. To anything, to any attack, there are always multiple causes. We must be able to step back and understand this. Once we are able to, we will no longer be angry...because we will understand, we will be compassionate. We may be annoyed, perturbed, but that will pass...because we will make an effort to work on the causes of the attack. We will care, and that's more of an attack than anything is. </P>
<P>Only then can we be externally disarmed. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Followed by a question and answer session, with questions one would normally ask the dalai lama. How can we all get along and the like. Compassion was the answer. </P>
<P>How do we raise our children? I don't know...followed by...care for them. Show them your love, set an example, be with them.</P>
<P>How does the theory of karma fit into Darwin's theory of evolution? That's too long. Not enough time. The person should read more books. lol</P>
<P>Listening to him made me realize that there is some truth in the phrase ""Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti."" That there were living examples of it. Usually, listening to someone in saffron robes makes me want to punch something. Like, how can people have so much blind faith? But the Dalai Lama didn't have blind faith. He just believed in humanity. I guess that's why I wasn't exactly inspired persay, because it was so obvious...and he doesn't put on a show of divinity...and he emphasizes that he is human. He told us of how, when he was young,&nbsp;he broke a pocket watch in two, out of anger,&nbsp;because the hands weren't moving. But there is something in the man that makes you think, makes you ponder. </P>
<P>Up till this moment, I thought i was becoming an adult...in the negative sense. More practical and&nbsp;without the power to&nbsp;save the world. I should just try for medical school...or pharmacy...have a career, a&nbsp;regular life. That I should completely settle for the normalcy of life. Average citizen, average woman, average mother, wife, employee, middle class tax payer, whatever. </P>
<P>I now know that I am becoming an adult...in the positive sense. I am becoming more practical. I just have to find a way to use this newfound&nbsp;power to save the world. </P>"

"event","<P><U><STRONG>My first impressions:</STRONG></U></P>
<P>As we took our seats I realized that the last time I was in a place that could&nbsp;hold this many people who&nbsp;wanted to see a prominent figure...was at the Bush rally. Now for those of you who could never see me going to a Bush rally, you're right. However, I was under the impression that it was a speech (we dressed up and everything), and although I'm not too happy with&nbsp;our (meaning the the U.S.) current political views, I respect my&nbsp;president and am willing to hear him speak, no matter how much trouble he has doing said activity, because, after all, it is the chance to go hear the president speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus it was an amazing experience because of the people I was with...no matter how gung-ho they were -_-' *no more years!* :P</P>
<P>The stark contrast with this event and the bush rally was that everyone was a lot more mellow. They realized the age and the importance of the figure who they were going to see and at times the hall was pin-drop silent. When Deepika and I went to go sit down, we were apologetic for having to step over people to get to our seats. As per the custom we were told that it was ""no problem,"" but what impressed me, and may seem a bit hippyish to some of you, was that we were ""welcomed"" by the people sitting next to us. Literally. The types of people, at both events, weren't all that different. You had the media, and the dignitaries, and the common folk who came because they believed in what was being said. But instead of the hardcore-redneck-get-off-mah-property hicks, there were the 50-piercings-on-their-face tree huggers. Bottom line: There are <STRONG>weird</STRONG> people in <EM>every</EM> group. <U>But:</U> The hippies definitely are not as belligerent as the hicks, no matter how weird and disconcerting it may seem. You're not going to get beaten up by hippies if you don't believe what they believe. (Sorry about the reference to the sterotypes, I know many of you are not like that...realize that I'm speaking about the extremes). </P> Case in point: There were people outside the convention center with signs saying ""Jesus is our savior"" etc etc. and no one cared...well, maybe one woman, but even she was like ""I believe that Jesus was a great man, but is there really any point for you to be here right now?"" lol. 
<P><U><STRONG>Random Thoughts on the Lama...lol:</STRONG></U></P>
<P>As I mentioned before, just as we were sitting, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and his esteemed translator were just stepping out on to the stage. The first thing he said was ""I hear there are young people here today."" Smiling, Deepika and I looked at each other and applauded loudly. I believe I told you that there was free seating for students yeah? Unfortunately they were all the way in the back, because that was where the majority of the loud applause came from. Just goes to show how much importance is actually placed on the ""future of the world,"" as was stressed by the Dalai Lama himself. *aside: I am getting wearied of referring to him as the Dalai Lama every time and want to call him the Lama. But, although that would be appropriate, I keep getting pictures of Kusco and The Emperor's New Groove every single time.*</P>
<P>The Dalai Lama is an extremely funny man.&nbsp;He could be a stand up comedian for serious people...and completely get away with it. He immediately asked&nbsp;for a moment as he took off his shoes and&nbsp;crossed his legs, after which he laughed because he found this way more comfortable. Now although that may not seem funny, you have to understand that here&nbsp;in front of us, was this 70 year old man, who&nbsp;had the world's weight on his&nbsp;shoulders as both a political and religious figure, yet he was laughing&nbsp;hysterically like&nbsp;Yoda...and that too, about something so trivial.&nbsp;Many times the joke would only bring a smile to one's lips, but would be amplified into&nbsp;belly laughs, simply&nbsp;because of the Lama's contagious joviality (word?). And yes, the Dalai Lama reminded me, <EM>numerous times</EM>, of Yoda. </P>
<P><U><STRONG>Before actually getting to his point:</STRONG></U></P>
<P>Now that he was completely situated, he began by sending a message to the victims of Katrina. ""You must have <STRONG>hope</STRONG>. You must <STRONG>rebuild.</STRONG> You must <STRONG>rise from the ashes</STRONG>."" He cited cities and countries that had been completely annhilated by natural disasters, as well as war ravaged areas of the world and pointed out that they could do it, that they did do it, and that they were stronger for it. </P>
<P>His actual talk was on ""Achieving Peace in a World of Violence."" Sappy, leftist, idealistic topic...I know. Let me tell you, as someone who is constantly disillusioned with the UN, there is no one more cynical about world peace. My conservative&nbsp;friends scoff at the impracticality of the idea, but me? I want to believe it badly, and knowing that it is impossible pains me to no extent.<EM> I am a critic who wants to believe</EM>...I am the best kind of critic, the best kind of believer...<EM>the worst kind of follower</EM>. <U>But:</U> on a personal level, his philosophy appealed to me. It's nothing I haven't heard before...""compassion."" Sammie said it all the time. ""Do we really need a religion? Why can't we all just be human?""&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><U>The Dalai Lama's solution to violence:</U></STRONG></P>
<P><EM>There are two kinds of disarmament, internal and external. <BR>Internal disarmament must be practiced by the individual&nbsp;for it is the individual's tenion and stress that causes tension and stress in a society. <BR>Without this peace in the society, external disarmament cannot be acheived.</EM></P>
<P>more to come...</P>"

"event","<P><U>Friday:</U> I go home and&nbsp;am vaguely told that the Dalai Lama&nbsp;is coming to Tucson. Of course my mother wants to go, and she wil be bringing my grandparents too. Well, with the ensuing ""practice"" and ""set-building"" the details&nbsp;are completely left out. (I came up with that dance in 20 min for those of you that care.)</P>
<P><U>Saturday:</U> morning consists of dance, of course, where once again i waste time. Shruti is absolutely adorable. That morning my mother has spoken to my grandparents who&nbsp;will be coming that night to attend Ganapati Ustav. Our play kicks ass...and ""we now own the MM"" (Golwalkar 2005), though really, it should be the ""PMMMMMMMMMMMM."" Anyways, that night my mother explains to me that we're going to the seminar at the Tucson convention center. I'm excited.</P>
<P><U>Sunday:</U> Here's the plan. Because my mom and grandparents are coming, there's no point in going back to tucson tonight. wtf???? my mother expects me to leave the house at 6:00 in the morning to reach my 8:00 bio lecture. I've been sleeping all day (getting rid of the shitty sick feeling), which, in essence, has been wasting time. ie I still need to complete my English paper and math homework. I'm beginning to care less and less. Sunday night: I go on ticket master to see how much tickets are etc. um....<STRONG>SOLD OUT</STRONG>. So now it doesn't seem like we're going anyway, plus <EM>I'm still in flipping Chandler</EM>...ha, without my homework done either. Whatever. I'm ok with it. I can't sleep since I've been sleeping all day, but i still don't end up finishing my paper...so pretty much Sunday never ended for me.</P>
<P><U>MoNdAy</U>: We leave at 6:30. I'm effing tired. I woke up early this morning to try to pull another Stafford-esque homework...but to no avail. So now it's me with my laptop in the car trying to finish. It's only four pages. <STRONG>shit</STRONG>. My dad's going to try to get tickets by going directly to the box office. meh. I have lost all faith. I think it's pointless. </P>
<P>I miss bio lecture... for the third time. I wasn't planning on going anyway. </P>
<P>At around 10:10 I get a call from my dad saying that they might have some tickets left in the student seating area. (My dad is still in shock over the fact that he spilled coffee all over his chair, and at this point it's all he can think of) Two per student. (If you recieved a phone call from me today at around 10:30 it was for this reason...we wanted at least three tickets) So we trudge down to the convention center...through <EM>ghet-to </EM>Tucson. Guess what? none left. none. I'm too nice to be pushy. So, a bit dejected (I'm not really that surprised) we drop me back off to campus to meet with my English teacher (at the effing CCIT building which took forever to find), after which I go finish my&nbsp;math, eat lunch, turn in my math, and sprint to lab. </P>
<P>On my way there, my dad calls. ""Your mom's on her way, give her a call."" <EM><U>WHAT???</U></EM> I thought we decided that there were no tickets!!!...er, apparently my mom's willing to take the chance. ""Alright Aai (it's what i call her),"" I tell her apprehensively, ""try to get two tickets. Call me <STRONG>only</STRONG> if you get two."" I'm at the lab now and tell professor what's up. She commends my mother's perseverence. woohoo. So i'm cutting my last sleeve of dishes when my back pocket starts to buzzzzzzzzz. ""I've got two tickets Lalita, do you think you can get a ride here?"" huh? are you serious? ""Yes...I just don't want to leave because parking is horrible."" I remember seeing the number of tickets that sold out in today's Daily Wildcat. ""Yeah, I'll try to get a ride there."" The only person I can think of is Deepika...who, drives over from the apartment, picks me up at the UMC, and takes me to the convention center. On the way there my mom calls again and asks if Deepika wants to go too...duh...So, SOMEHOW, my mother gets this amazing floor seat. Not only that, but me and Deepika park illegally, run to the center and are allowed straight in (thanks again to my mom) without having to wait in the ridiculously looong line, something along the lines of 7,300 people. When we get in, the Dalai Lama has just come out on to the platform and is taking a seat. </P>
<P><EM>It was so unexpected, so random, so bizarre, that it is&nbsp;questionable whether&nbsp;the experience even had the desired result...</EM></P>

"event","<P>I'm really really excited for college. Today I spent about three hours at Preeth's house because my effing computer wasn't letting me do the academic tour. Point is I'm <STRONG><U>really really really ridiculously</U></STRONG> excited now. I wasn't before at all which made me sad. I've always thought that one of the most important things about college is being excited about it, and because it was instate...i just wasn't. I thought that I might have ruined my life...etc...and getting shit about it from other people wasn't encouraging. i guess i just really let it get to me because I was so damn dissapointed in myself for ""selling out"" or ""being a slacker.""&nbsp;I don't know...&nbsp;However, the idea of actually signing up for my classes and living in a dorm and realizing that check in is only two months away...<STRONG>yup it's gonna be good</STRONG>.&nbsp; :-)</P>
<P>I think I'm coming down with a cold or something. My throat is itchy...but I can't sleep.&nbsp;I haven't been able to sleep properly for the past week now...however, going online seems to be futile since there are only nine people on...mostly idle with away messages. It's dumb...so tonight i didn't even try...watch, with my luck everyone is actually having some sort of midnight AIM party. Whatever. I'm online way too much lately, every freaking night...makes you realize how tired you aren't, how hard you're not working, how much time you actually waste in your life...and yet it's so damn addictive.</P>
<P>I think i'm going through midnight depression. It's like insomnia with a sadistic twist. ew. i don't like it. Positve thoughts: Oh yeah...guess what I won! So my mom works at Philips and so like a good daughter (bahahahahah) I apply for the scholarship...well, I made the final cut but not the bajillion dollar prize...so guess what the consolation prize is?&nbsp;A new CD system/radio. It's flat so you can hang it up on your wall. It's so freaking sweet. I was happy. I put it together and literally sat there for like 30 min just opening and closing the CD port thingy...it <EM>slides</EM> up like something straight out of a sci-fi flick. sooo cool. soooo not taking this down to Tuscon...lol. </P>
<P>I've decided that girls are weird. But guys are just confusing. It's a wonder that we all get along so well....</P>
<P>I'm sorry, did I say get along well? I must have been delusional for a split second there. Clearly I don't read the papers. :-( </P>
<P>I've also decided that I've tried keeping in touch with people that i want to keep in touch with. AIM, my friends, is a godsend...and those who really matter to me...i've tried. For those of you who are awesome...I've seen around. and the rest? well that depends on how much I mean to you. Sometimes you have to make the effort to talk to someone...I'm done being the ""bitch,"" the one who genuinely makes the effort. Sadly, I'm on the verge of not caring anymore. I wish i wasn't. Crikey. late night bitchiness...that's what this is. Sorry....about that. </P>
<P>Oh man. People are retarded. I feel lame. I just need to talk to someone.</P>"

"event","With this increasingly cosmopolitan society that we live in, foods and other such cultural items that once used to isolate and identify various civilizations have now become commonplace...everywhere. Seriously, some things that are suited to Norway, for example, are not suited for Trinidad and Tobago, and yet if you want Norweigan food in the Bahamas, you can get Norwegian food in the Bahamas. Getting things from India in the US used to be so expensive because shipping things was so damn difficult. But with this globalization and increase in technology it is even possible to grow tropical plants in Michigan. Still, even though I understand the increasingly easier concept of preservation of culture away from the ""motherland,"" is it always so prudent to fight to keep your tradition and culture in a place that is so ill-suited to harbor it?"

"event","What does one do when one feels unaccomplished? 

What does one do when one doesn't know how to react, how to approach something?

What does one do when one feels like they've let the opportunity of a lifetime slip through their fingers...about 13 days ago, actually.

An idle mind is that devil's workshop, they say, so i guess depression is the onset of having a lack of things to do. So i need to do something about not having anything to do. 

Get a job? Perhaps. 
Where? I don't know. 

What does one do when one doesn't feel like anything is changing, when it seems like it's still the middle of April...of junior year...even though there is no possible way it ever could be. 

I think I kinda understood what heartbreak was this year...though it wasn't due to a person. 

I was told that I am a bad listener today.
I don't like listening to people griping all the time about their oh-so-sad life, because damn it, complaining is going to get you nowhere. 
I don't like people griping about things that they could have done something about. 
Some people don't deserve to be bashed for trying their hardest, especially by those who either a)didn't do shit about it or b)did shit about it and are just griping to be cool. 

Hence, I don't care that I'm a bad listener. 

But I wonder, if I were in the same position...would I gripe? If I wanted to blame my lack of success on someone...would I gripe? Would I get mad if no one listened?

I say horrible things sometimes. Sometimes I say stupid things. Sometimes I'm just naive. Sometimes I don't know what to think about people, and sometimes I wonder what they think of me. 

Ambiguity is quite poetic. Hopefully I struck a nerve, brought out an emotion, whatever. If not today, then I plan on affecting the world in some way...so you can't stop it, it's going to happen eventually.

Today I've though of a lot of these things and haven't come to a conclusion simply because I am convinced by both sides. heh. Maybe this is why I understood Kerry. Maybe I now have too open of a mind. The result of that is lack of conviction. Great. I have no conviction.

My annual catharsis? more like my daily catharsis of the past two weeks melded into one. It may not seems like it, but I think too much, talk to myself too often, and daydream constantly. Quite pathetically so."

They had like this 24 birthday bash cuz Sagar had a sleep over last night and then we picked them up from there and took them to Stratum. ha. it was great. I had to go pick up stuff for goody bags and pump gas in my car (the light had been on since last night) so I got to go there by myself. I took 101 and then 60...it was&nbsp;my first time on the 60 by myself. yay. I need a CD player for my little baby...I can't listen to&nbsp;cassettes forever. </P>
<P>Last night we had people over and had like a mini, informal singing party. I haven't had one of those since Albuqueruqe. However, whoever started singing set the pitch freakin high and everybody was streching their voices like crazy. it was bad. </P>
<P>Friday night Alma came over and we finally did her mehendi. finally. and watched Devdas lol...waste of time...waste of a LOT of time, the entire night actually. Her henna looks flipping amazing though. seriously. and i'm not just saying it to brag cuz last night i did it on my own hand and it looks like crap. So go see her mehendi if you have time :). (Alma, you should take a picture of it and send it to me hahahahahahahahha) We started the movie at one and it ended at like 5 and got soooo boring for the both of us. I told her we should watch Amar Akbar Anthony, that GENIUS movie, but the Devdas cover (the book kind), frankly, is ten times cooler.</P>
<P>I drove around a lot yesterday too cuz i had that philips scholarship to take care of. I barely had the $14.00 that i needed to overnight it, which would explain why I had not a penny to purchase fuel for my automobile and ran on empty of two hours. Yes, i know that's not safe. I've already had to have my dad bring me gas while I was stalled in the school parking lot. lol.</P>

now for the not-so-annoyingly-vague update...

My glands are swollen and my eyes are tired and hurting and my neck is sore and it hurts to swallow and i have to go to school tomorrow. I wish i could just stay home. I wish i could go cosmic bowling. I wish that life would be easier. I wish that I didn't analyze everyone and everything to death (i guess that comes with being an AP student). I wish that Diana's professor will get in touch with Professor Eloy Rodriguez and that I'll be able to go to South America. I wish that people would stop being so addicted to drama because most things don't deserve to be blown out of proportion *idiots*. I wish that I could take compliments better...yeah a weird wish...i know...I wish that I could get over this ridiculous fascination with boys...lol...not completely cuz otherwise i wouldn't be ok with myself, however it's a flipping distraction and i feel cheap, which I HATE. I wish that my nose wasn't crooked...hahahaha...stupid low-self esteem induced worthless wishes...might as well wish for world peace...it's that pointless (the sad thing is that i'm excluding many wishes which fall into this category). I wish we had won...sigh, again pointless. I wish people didn't have to go through horrible shit in their life. I wish I had a yacht and that I knew how to sail. I wish that school wasn't almost over, yet I wish it was... I wish that my project will come together for CARSEF and I wish that we kick everyone elses arses. I wish the college board didn't exist. I wish that I could spend time with people who I haven't seen in a long time (i miss you guys). I wish that I could spend more time with people who i see all the time. I wish I was more disciplined and that I didn't have senioritis. *must resist not doing homework* I wish school started later, though I would still probably be late...every single flipping day...I wish I could still dance. I wish I had a higher singing voice and someone to be my teacher. I wish I had no homework. I wish I had monies. I wish I would stop wishing for things, get up and go DO stuff...ha. I can do that. 
I'm out. later"

"event","<P>The Economist is flipping amazing. I just wish I had known about its amazingness before. I mean, not even the times or the post has such relevant articles. I guess that's the difference between international newspapers and those catered to an American audience. Nothing wrong in that...i mean, with such a kickass economy, who needs to care what happens in the rest of world? We'll just see how long that kickass economy can hold us up before we HAVE to pay attn to someone more powerful...(i hope the day never comes)</P>
<P>Speaking of international news...MUN was ridiculously amazing. The Russian/UK alliance was the strongest thing there. *sigh* good times...i've never been such a good munner in my life. Having such a kickass country really made a difference, can't wait till college. However, the entire experience has been quite disillusioning. While writing resolutions, each country is always so worried about their national sovereignty...it's understandable, but then wth is the un there for???? Honestly, like the whole ECOSOC sub-comittee the UK and I&nbsp;made, it should just be a discussion forum where countries can bring things up. Force is not going to work cuz no one likes bringing a third party into it. This is why federations are so shitty. Which brings me to the fact that Russia, no matter what it says, is not in any way a federation. </P>
<P>Moving on to something not so serious or political, I woke up late today. It was great. M&nbsp;&amp; M-azing lol. Then i leisurely did my econ homework and got to school by 11:30, after driving around for 20 min with the windows down, just in time for the WTP mtg. in the corner of the econ room. HAHAHAHAHA...talk about factionalizing. We're actually DOING stuff...which makes me proud. Yes, proud. I said it. PROUD. (thank you btw, it means a lot)</P>
<P>er...why do people think i'm some sort of a intellectual saint? (I'm talking to various ppl online who are comparing themselves to me...and then telling me that i don't have a life.)

it's nearly 11:00 and i have nothing better to do than to be online because i can't sleep. I have a bio exam worth 40% of my grade tomorrow. I have a resolution to actually do my homework in the classes that had been neglected last semester due to undertakings which I have decided that I would undertake all over again in a heartbeat. Though the bittersweetness of said activity would be so much better if we could only apply what we know. 

Okay...here it comes...

I understand that it's been a month, and yet I can't help but cringe and/or want to hit something everytime any reference is made to our performance that fateful january day. If I've discussed this with you, I've probably told you about my rapid journey through the five stages of grief...you may scoff, but to the fourteen (sixteen including Spears and Norman) of us it was a HUGE thing, which deserved grieving. I can't help but wonder if we could have done anything different, or if we had just changed ONE thing, or answered ONE question...(gah). But that doesn't matter. What's done is done, which is why I'm ok with it. Life moves on yada yada yada...and no matter how cliche it is, it's the truth and it has made me a better person. What I did, what I learned, what I went through, was for the sake of the knowledge itself and I did not expect any reward, persay, in return. We have won because of how powerful we are now. In fact, we all pay attention to the same things in the news and are able to analyze and understand that everything cannot be taken at face value. Though I may not be able to say the same for everyone, instead of being brainwashed and partisan, we think about issues and accept different points of view because we want to make the best decision. I love you all and still consider you good friends even if we don't talk all the often anymore. Why? Because we're a team, and we're elite. 
Which is why we need to kick it up 20 notches. Not just one damnit...twenty. What's the purpose of the damn program? To win effing nationals? I don't think so. The purpose is to learn how to apply the fundamentals of our government to issues that play a hand in OUR lives. If we can do that, as a team, as a group of people who freaking CARE, what more do we want? There are so many things we can battle for, so many things we can have an impact on, so many things that we can DO for the sake of our nation. And ya kno? If we're so damn elite, who says we have to go grassroots? We KNOW ppl. We know how to HANDLE ppl. And we can bypass all the shitty stuff and take it straight to the top. I know all of you have some shit that you're worried about or that you want to change. All we need now is a way to implement it. It has to be for the benefit of the nation whatever it is, and we have to do it fast. We've alreay got a club...we just need to change the objectives of it. We can do charity...tsuanmi anyone? We can bring issues to the mainstream...ha. darfur...damn bastards. We can do anything. Have you seen us? Have you seen who we are? Everyone expected us to win damn it...and win we will. For those of you wanting recognition...what's more important...winning nationals in a structured, practiced environment? or actually doing shit to change this country to what WE want instead of letting the preceding generation screw it up for us as they currently are... I do believe the latter holds more importance in convictions and in admiration. In fact, I would much rather gain national recognition that way...instead of some obscure first place win. 
We know what we are capable of. In regards to implementing it...why the hell not???"

"event","<P>Haha. It's true...only asenath, leena, and xu read this thing. :)</P>
<P>&nbsp;Just came back from dance class...although I decided to change my icon because it has the potential to depress me, I've decided that I like it and I'm going to keep it. My padam kicks ass. It's got so many aweseom poses and not that much footwork :). It's so freaking cool. (Padam=name of a particular type of dance i'm learning.)Ahhhh...getting those endorphins going early in the morning makes my day ten times better. </P>
<P><STRONG>And now for the day to drive itself off a cliff...</STRONG></P>
<P>1. Stupid ethics essay.</P>
<P>2. Stupid scholarships</P>
<P>3. Stupid world history that i have to do or can't graduate...lol</P>
<P>4. Stupid other stupid homework</P>
<P>5. Stupid family parties...and india night? :( I really did want to see sanjana dance...</P>
<P>Plus...science research is driving me nuts. My plant is not the problem...in fact it is so not the problem that it's already able to do everything that I want to test. First off, trying to kill bacteria with extract seems like such a juvenile experiment...the fact its been done makes it suck even more. So, two days ago I decide to change the entire thing over and test it as an insecticide...which hasn't <U>technically</U> been done. Now I have to go read up on fruit flies...annoying buggers... though I WANT to work with mosquitoes...yes, even more annoying. However, it seems like i'm going to do the e-coli thing anyway, just because ms. clark needs me to ""have something for HISEF."" bah humbug. *sigh*...Drosophila here I come...or as ms. richmond calls em, Drososophia...like some Russian princessa. lol.</P>
<P><STRONG>And speaking of RUSSIA...</STRONG></P>
<P>I'm really really really ridiculously excited about MUN. Really. I've had to do WMD, chemical and biological warfare and other such shitty stuff&nbsp;for three monotonous years in a row. HA! not anymore! I'm going UNDP/ECOSOC/ILO baby! Economic and Social improvement...hell yeah. I know I know...UN=paper tiger...and positive rights are worth no more than a rupee...but to me it seems more practical than trying to get belligerent nations to form nuclear weapons free zones. Though disarmament of ""dangerous nations"" isn't going to happen with Idiot America* trying to shove it down people's throats. Sometimes we <EM>can</EM> be excessively stupid...</P>
<P>*Yes. I got the <U>American I-word</U> CD...lol apurva. Good stuff that is. I would so love to be called the ""last link of the brink of destruction."" That song is strangely romantic. Me likes.</P>
<P><STRONG>ALLIE SAW BRIDE AND PREJUDICE...</STRONG></P>
<P>Without...me... I was sad. But she LOVED it, which makes me excessively happy. Aishwarya Rai has my name. Mine. yay. I don't care what you think of her, I like her...so there. I was telling allie about sonu nigam and how amazing he is and how i absolutely adore his voice. She said she was too bust watching the movie to listen to the guy sing. puh. fine. whatev... oh shit...i said it. Anywho, I was just telling Allie about all this and Madame Cowger comes up to me asking me ""what do you want?"" Well, I know that she was talking about which test I needed but what I needed at that moment was someone who could sing like Sonu Nigam...seriously...lemme know if you know anyone like that *dreams*...or if you want me to sing any of his songs lol...I freaking rock at them. (Yes i do practice...and not just hindi songs thankyou very much.)</P>
<P>I feel like...going out...and now i can. muahahahahahahaha. let's see if we can con les parents into letting. In other words, I'm leaving now. ha. *Phenomonal Cosmic Powah!*...</P>
<P>Alright sweets...catch ya laterz</P>

I... think I have amnesia and I don't really understand why... 

It's a good thing I broadcast pretty much every goddamn thought I have onto the Internet so that I can remind myself of who I am daily a la The Notebook

antero AND retrograde amnesia like, my mind is foggy and burned out and nothing people tell me sticks anymore, and when thinking about the past I can only recall a very basic rough outline that is probably misremembered anyways, and trying to replay particular scenes or focus on details is impossible

feels like my brain is surrounded in cotton balls

so anyways, storing my identity and basically my entire consciousness and ego externally on a computer like some gay cyberpunk shit sounds sweet at first, but i'm concerned that if I didn't have crappy blog posts and pictures of myself on facebook to stare at for hours every day I would eventually forget who I was and revert to some kind of zombified mindless primate laying around his cage all day scratching and hooting every now and again

NOT THAT I DON'T DO THAT ANYWAYS

but I mean, I would go completely feral without the illusion of being socially active and visible in the public eye that the internet so cruelly provides

additionally, relying on the internet to remember things for me makes me pretty paranoid considering how easy it would be for someone to change information around without me even realizing it... How can I be sure i'm the one that wrote all this stuff when I don't even remember writing any of it??? Spooky!

So, I dunno why i'm like this now or maybe if I was always like this and just never realized it until recently, but this computer aided thinking is a terrible crutch that I gotta get rid of! If somebody decided to HAXX my computer and set it up so that they could remote access my desktop and see what i'm looking at on the internet in real time, they would be able to literally read my mind as I constantly google and wikipedia trifling facts and trivia that i'm too lazy to try and remember on my own

I'm with Prince, FUCK the internet!"

For some reason I was under the impression that it's been much longer. How odd.

I don't really have much to report since last entry, other than I think I must have hit my head really hard between this entry and that one because i've been feeling awfully... concussed for at least the last couple of months

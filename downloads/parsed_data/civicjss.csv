"event","Sorry i haven't written in a few days...its been hectic:

- Gots me a DVD burner, been tryin to catch up on some movies i've wanted. I'm literally going to save myself hundreds of dollars (no..not on car insurance by switching to Geiko)

- Been working a whole lot..gotta make that $$ man

- Turned 22 sometime this past week. Whoo-hoo lol. The way i see it, its all downhill from twenty-one.

- Saw my girlfriend a whole lot, and thats what really makes me happy. My life is simply dealing with the fact that i cannot see her all the time, but its literally waiting, knowing that anything that's been going wrong when she wasn't around will all of a sudden DISAPPEAR when we get to spend that next day/hour/minute/phone call/early morning text message together. Anything, just together.

Just studied for my vocab quiz tomorrow...i think i should do alright. It is amazing to me how much easier it is to remember things i find even remotely interesting as opposed to boring ass shit. Go figure

i love you mary clare.

"event","Today started out great! Here's a quick recap of my day:

8:00am - Woke up and signed onto Ramapo.edu and found that school had been cancelled. Sickkkkkkkness!

8:02am - Realized that i also did not have to work tonight. Double sickk.

8:03am - Thought of all the cool things on could do on a day where i had nothing i HAD to do.

8:04am-4:45pm - Sat on couch, ate, was a complete fucking bum :)

4:46pm - Picked up check at blockbuster, went to the bank, came back.

5:35pm - Sat back on couch. HAHAHAHA

10:22pm - Went back to give ppl at work a hand for a little while (why not i was doing nothing)

12:22am - Got home, day is over. :-D


I'm set to watch M. Night Shamalyn's ""The Village"". I'll be sure to review it in my next entry. Tomorrow is busy busy. School, then work, then possibly drive home to see Ms. Icicle. We'll have to see how awake i am.

p.s. I thought about my gf all day. I sometimes forget how much i do think about her, but im usually busy or on the go or somethin. She's great. Everyone should have one just like her. just not her. That model is mine.

"event","Damn it's really coming down out there!! Fist like real serious snow of the year, and it's January 6th...thats crazy.

I had class today, again, but i wont bore anyone with details of that.  After class i came back here and....yep you guessed it...fell asleep.  I was in super-comfortable clothes so it just happened. Woke up around 12 and started to get myself movin to go see the princess. GOt home aorund 3 and spent a few hours at home with her. I was worried that the weather was going to get bad so i came back early, but not early enough. It was snowing real bad almost the whole ride back but it was cool.

We were talking about rearranging her room this weekend, but im not sure how well that idea will work out. It was kinda like at my apartment, when we had to arrange everything around where the cable jacks/outlets were.  Its the same idea as that for her computer and cable modem.

I caught some of the news when i got back today, and they keep updating this Tsunami thing.  Its real terrible, but like amazing how many people were effected by it. Over 100,000 dead is CRAZY. Makes life feel like nothing if it can be just taken away like that so quickly, and not to mention in such a large number.

Quick note: I hate people who feel the need to draw all attention to themselves for everylittle thing that seems to be going on in their lives. Its annoying and pathetic.

School tomorrow, or maybe not if the snow/sleep/rain whatever it is keeps up.

"event","Hello to all who have stumbled upon the livejournal of me, Phil Camuso.  I felt it was about time to put down on ""paper"" what happens in my life.  Then maybe i won't complain to all of you who have to hear me on a daily basis.

I'm rockin out to the movie ""Dirty Work"" starring the ackwardly classy Norm Macdonald.  I saw him recently doing a short standup routine at some MTV awards ceremony crap thing.  Honestly, the guy hasn't lost anything in all the years hes been in the biz.  Funny as hell if u ask me.  This movie is a classic too man..funny as hell.

So i worked again tonight, surprize surprize. Wasn't that bad though as it seemed to pass fairly quickly.  One thing that continues to get me more and more mad as the days drag on is this new fucking late fee policy.  I swear if i have to explain it to another customer, my head is going to explode. F it.  It's just nice to know that i don't have to work for the next two days.

That totally makes me wonder.....
When i finally get to the point in my life where my ""career"" is set to begin, am i still going to live my life waiting for those days off of work? Or will i love my job, or at least enjoy it enough to be able to not think of when i DON'T have to work next...rather just live and be happy on a daily basis...just a thought.

I know one thing that does keep me strong is knowing that i will see her tomorrow...and saturday, and sunday night too :) Its all about 'us' now, and honestly...i love it. I wouldn't like to have my life any other way right now (except maybe if i woke up tomorrow with my college diploma lol). It sounds so corny but anything i do with her makes me happy. Take this Saturday's tentitive plans we have set for example....
We WERE planning on going skiing with friends, a perfectly awesome idea and it would have been alot of fun, however we probably wont go...for mixed reasons. So instead, i offered to help Mar move her room around, you know just to change things up a little bit. And seriously, im looking forward to doing that with her.  Any little thing that might make her day, i am completely interested in doing.  Sometimes i wonder if im too serious for her, and i know shes in a different stage of her life and may want to go out and party and whatnot...but over all i know in my heart that everything is going to work out just how it is supposed to. And i really think that we are supposed to be together. Just thinking about the fact as to how strong our relationship is right now totally puts me at ease and not to mention a huge smile on my face. I love her.

Ok, back to ""Dirty Work', which should steer me right into dreamland...My DVD collection is shaping up verrrrryyy nicely. Now all i need is that cool swivelling DVD holder to make me look like a Pro (wink wink princess).  Cough birthday present cough all i want cough for my birthday cough :-)

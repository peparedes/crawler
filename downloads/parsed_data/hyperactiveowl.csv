There for awhile I wasn't even flapping I was just tucked into a wet (sorry Herm, too much water there for even your spell to manage) ball bouncing too and fro, and then WAM I almost bludger the witch off her broom.

Ron- shall be somewhere in America.  If you really <b> NEED </b> me, send an owl or something...but don't send Errol, I don't think he'd survive the transatlantic trip, perhaps Harry would let you use Hedwig?  She has made it before I think.

Thought I was going to OR-E-Gun.  But now it seems auntie is going on a holiday as soon as I get there, I got a note today, and some YUMMY bug crunchies (which I ate greedily all up.  Wow auntie can make the greatest bug snacks!  Yellow bugs, and green bugs, and lintgy bugs, MNNNN all mashed up into their purest essance, BUG PASTE!).  Let's see.  The note said something about a fire mountain (cause there are some great hot bugs up there, and lot's of spicy ones, or so she has heard)- but I don't really understand how a mountain can be a mountain AND fire.  And the off to the midwest, over in IOWUH and MIZURE for the obligorty familial visits.  Loverly...have to go the fully monty this year.  Eeesh, managed to get out of those for the last few years, guess my luck ran out.  Oh well, the eating in IOWUH and MIZURE are great!! There are hog bugs, and lot's of corn field bugs....and misqutoes, and I'm getting hungry just thinking about them all...even though I am already stuffed!

I shall try to send some posty cards (muggle cards with pictures), I think the wizarding stores sell some as a joke, but the usually bite or some other such hazard.  Think I can get them to un-hex that.

Later~ Pig

ps- Have a great summer ya'll.

pps- what is this I heard about a rogue snitch? <i> chuckle, hee, hee, hee.  Wondered when it was going to get loose.  Sad I cannot stay to watch the fun the next couple of days.....</i> Well I hope it doesn't interrupt anything important, like an OWL (which would be tragic, well just cause they are CALLED owls, hee).

"event","Funny, I didn't know cats sent mail.  I guess they do.  Cause I ran into an old friend of mine, who had something that needed delivered to Nasty Norris Kitty, (of all beings), so I offered to take it, since I was heading back that way anyways.  And the package was being returned after being refused by the sender.  Wonder what nasty norris was sending, and why it was refused.  Hmmmn.  Strange.  Ah, not worth MY time.  My time was being MUCH better spent.....


Ahhh, the plan went without a hitch.  Ace of a plan.  Now to perch back and watch the fireworks, Aggro indeed!..... Thank goodess I just ate.  Lots of yummy bugs....I like bugs.  Red bugs, and white bugs, and green bugs, and orange bugs, and prilliy bugs, and snarky bugs, and mothey like bugs....YUMM!!!! What was I , oh yeah!  That.  

Now I can record said plan for the betterment of, well, me.  And Ron of course.  Not sure I approve of all what he is doing right now, mainly cause I like Hermy-o-knee.  ~owl shrug and Pig settles in for a nice long entry~ And here it is- 

<lj-cut text=""THE PLAN.  The following is hexed, and voice recorded in owl so no one can break in and read it but another owl""> 

Well I have tried to protect this as best as possible, as I think that all hexes are breakable, no matter how strong they are. So I won't name names, as I want to protect the innocent.  But someone or someones liberated the balls they use to play that sport.  Ron was so mad the last time he played it.  

So I wanted to help.  

For Ron. Sweet kid....most of the time.  When he isn't being a wanker...............
And to get that nasty Norris involved too ~hooting laughter~. I am not sure I know <b> ANYONE </b> who likes ole nasty ceptin older and nastier Filthy man.  at least I think that is his name.  Filtch?  Ah, whatever.  He is of no concequence to me.  HE is too slow and stupid to catch me!  I am too fast.  I think he leaves me alone too cause he knows that I eat up the spiders.  I don't think he likes spiders.  But spiders taste good....then again not many humans like spiders.  Never could understand why not.


So I was 'gifted' the snitch.  I think it is the really fast ball (but nowhere near as fast as me) that Harry <i> always </i> catches.  One of the house elves who owed me a favor make me a special snitch proof basket.  It is hexed and charmed, and location spell proofed, and whatever else that nice house elf did for me.  He said even ~next word said with awe~ Dumbelee-door wouldn't be able to find it.  When he heard the plan he just laughted, and told me that that none of the elves like that nasty norris kitty.  I think she likes to chase and tease them.  Maybe even EAT them. ~said with Horror~ not that I know mind you.  But still! Why eat elves when there are nice yummy things like BUGS out there????....So when he heard where I wanted to hide it, he made the basket out of that catnipe, er whatever that kitty plant is.  You know, what Crookshanks gave me for my birthday.  Same stuff.  Said that it was irresitable to ALL cats, even nasty norris!  The basket held the snitch all nice and tight.  It is even specially weighted so as not to be able to float off.  

Now how to deliver it, I though...so I flew in all out in the open.  Like I was delivering 'official mail', even got an elf to address it for me.  It's done up so that it looks like nasty norris was trying to send it somewhere and it got returned cause the recipient refused the package or something.  Heee-hoooooo.  See since it is 'official' mail, if anyone did see me, they won't think about it, cause no one pays attention to someone working officially.  I mean, how often do any of the kids notice the house elves working???? Really. 

So that is pretty much all I am willing to record.  Not a chance will I spill who did the liberating.  Matter of fact, don't think I know said liberators name.  Too many humans, so little time. ~ponders that that statement could be a certain liberaters personal SLOGAN, and hoots quitely in laughter~ Ahem.</lj-cut>

Wonder what this herb actually is.  Think I want to take herb classes.  Seems to me there is alot out there that I don't know.  Although some of it I could care less about.  Perhaps I just want to know about herby stuffs cause bugs like plants....if so that seems to be a good reason to me.

You know, I saw one of the snaky house people attempting to sneek into Gryffindor's commons room today.  Didn't think they were supposed to even know where it was.  maybe they didn't know where they were, although it seemed blatant to me.  I beleive the Lady told them to 'Bugger off', right jolly of her I thought, was amused to hear her say it THAT way, didn't think she even knew such language....

<P>Went snake hunting in the gardens.&nbsp; Caught enough of the snigger snakes to protect the foodstuffs there for another month or so. Well the last 20 or so snakes that I caught I took inside to eat.&nbsp; I mean, I wasn't wet or anything, but I was getting a wee bit chilled.&nbsp; And they were yummy enough to deserve some attention in my eating.&nbsp; So I found myself a quite corner up in the rafters of a rather large somewhat drafty room..and low and behold it was the snake commons. ~Pig's voice is dripping with false honesty~ What an accident.&nbsp; No one was there to bother me, so I decided to go ahead and finish up eating.&nbsp; Owls have a wee bit of magic.&nbsp; I mean, if you didn't know, you should have.&nbsp; It's pretty obvious.&nbsp; How else would we always know where to find someone?&nbsp; Or where to go?&nbsp; And I am small enough I always get overlooked...that is if I am not bouncing off of the walls....and I wasn't bouncing off the walls, I was too busy eating yummy snakes.&nbsp; The last clawful of snakes (of various type that I had hunted round abouts today) I bit the heads off of first, the heads are quite the deliciy...and then the unforeseen and completely ~stresses this word with a mischievous look in the eyes~ accidental thing happened. I <STRONG>DROPPED THE BEHEADED SNAKES</STRONG>. OOOPS. I thought about whizzzzzzzzzzing down to get them, really I did.&nbsp; But I heard someone about to enter the room, so I left before they made it in.&nbsp; Good thing I am like a bomb. I THINK it was one of the professors, one whose name rather sounds like snakes. But by the time they entered, I was long gone.&nbsp; Although I was tempted to stay and watch, I mean, it may <U>have</U> been an accident, but why not capitalize on it?&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the long run, I am sure it is safer that I left.</P>

I wish things were like the used to be, growing up with Auntie. Traveling all over the world. No worries beyond what type of bug to eat next. Not that I am not happy with Ron or anything.&nbsp; He is a nice boy. I need to belong somewhere afterall...it's just....huh, not only house elves deserve rights.&nbsp; And I shan't let a stray thought of this escape to ANY of the elves.&nbsp; Just because I think it, does not mean they need to hear it, and then avoid me in anger.&nbsp; They could demand it.&nbsp; They don't.&nbsp; They are old enough and powerful enough to do something about it if they really wanted too.&nbsp; And alot of wizards would help them. So it stands to reason that they don't. Want to any road. But like I was thinking, owls should have a few more rights, vacations or something.&nbsp; Then again, we are also old enough, and powerful enough (just think if the owl post went on one of those muggle strikes!) to do something if we wanted too.&nbsp; Some of us do.&nbsp; Not enough, and I am neither big enough, or strong enough to even voice this to those that don't.&nbsp; Then again, if I TOOK a vacation and Ron actually NEEDED me, where would HE be?&nbsp; And that just cannot happen....although it would be nice to be able to buy a treat now and then.</EM></P>"

At least the no-wet part worked, but <FONT color=#33ff33 size=5><STRONG>GREEN</STRONG></FONT>? I think I could handle blue, but green.&nbsp; I'd rather not be green. </lj-cut> </P>
<P>Oh, hey, Crookshanks <lj-cut text= ""An idea"">  If you want, and if Hermioioio, er, haven't quite managed her name yet, will spell your fur too, would you like to join me snake hunting?&nbsp; If she spells your fur so you cano't get wet, it is quite fun.&nbsp; And snakes ARE so yummy.....~sudden thought~ AND we could leave some beheaded ones in the Snake human's common area.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I know the way in, I mean, there is a way in to each of them for the house elves (which means YOU can get in), AND for their owls.....And snake heads are my favorite part....It might be fun...</lj-cut> </P>
<P><EM>Reminder to self: Write Auntie Whiat later.&nbsp; Soon. Oh, if I forget she will fly all the way over here from America and pluck some feathers...Let's not get her mad.&nbsp; Especially not right before your birthday silly owl.&nbsp; She might not send her famous buggles.&nbsp; And that would be a tragedy, no buggles on you birthday!&nbsp; how HORRID.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Another Reminder to Self: See what Ron is up to.&nbsp; Burn on some energy by bouncing off the walls in Gryffindor's common room. Not that I can HELP it, but at least I can find it FUNNY.</EM></P>"

"event","Well, it only took me about a year, but I finally convinced everyone that I deserved a journal of my very own.  I mean really, look at all the other owls.  They have journals, somewhere.  Perhaps it is because everyone thought I was only going to thought scribe things about bugs.  I DO think about more things than just bugs.  Well, ok, most of the time I think about bugs.  Especially when I am hungry.  I am not hungry now.  I just ate.  Bugs of course, yummy yellow flittery bugs.  Note to self: Remember where the yummy yellow flittery bugs are at."

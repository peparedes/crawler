"event","heehee i love that song, the new mace song, i was gonna use the title goddamn its been a long time... but then i thought of that song, his whole new ""reinvention""...tres interesting, by the way has anyone else heard about Jay-Z coming back as an alter ego ""SEan Carter"", I think Danda told me that... im intrigued as to kno wat Mr. Carter will be rappin bout now...hmmm... wat is up wit everyone and new come backs and names... Madonna is Esther or however the facock thats spelled.. and i cant think of who else but i kno theres more mofos wit identity issues... shiet wen normal people have identity crises they buy motorcycles or have affairs, or go crazy and scream at people on subways but no no famous people change there names like oooo i dont have sex wit a camera anymore and pop a cap in anuses no no NOW because i have a new name i am special, I'm gonna do that... maybe ill make my name Tara, just Tara ( haha just JAck!!!...anyway) cuz everyone calls me that anyway or maybe ill pick a religious name like the artist formerly known as Madonna and change my name to Torah or like Imani or sumthin, I like the name Imani, My name is now Imani Shalom Koran, Now I have the spirituality of three religions and am no longer a bitch *hum*... raise ur tin-foil cups to the sun and humm wit me people, we'l start a revolution... ok lmao if u dont kno wat im talkin bout u dun wanna kno...

SO anyway let's give a recap of life... Im outta school for the summer, tres exciting, but I miss my mountain man... yes yes a shaggy beard boy from my school, I wish he would come to me and say ""Imani Shalom Koran, come with me and we shall live with the wild deer and bears and hillbillies, where there r no coastal flooding evacuation signs and eat the grass"" well ok so thats not gonna happen but it would be REALLY funny if it did...ps- in case u were wondering ninny andi recently discoverd signs that said"" COastal Evacuation route"" or some shit liekthat,dude seriously that shit is scary like do they kno something we dont, well thats fine well just be in the middle of like a tidal wave shit and the news will say please proceed to ur coastal evacuationsites, how many people do u htink actual kno about those shits well now ya do, uve beeen warned the end of the world is coming AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!....well me and nicole will survive at least lmao

I started working at two jobs in MAy: a flower shop and Barnes & Noble Cafe, no not ""Starbucks"" Barnes and Noble CAFE, lets clarify now people, pay attention, so yeah the flower shop really blew, I swear to god ive never met such STUPID FUKIN DUMBASSES... I obviously dont work there anymore but the best reason is WHY.. the fukin retard bitch that was my boss would NEVER listen to me and would always ""lose"" my notes... i would tell every week that i had another job and couldnt work certain days and wat would she do fukin call me the next week and ask me to work those same GODDAMN DAYS!!!! like really r u fukin slow do u want me to write out in petals thats wat ill do il arrange all the plants into a big sign like an sos on an abandoned island onl y my sign will be a Y.S.A.B. (you stupid-ass bitch) sign ... grrr WATEVER i only go there once in awhile wen they randomly call me cuz the stupid bitch who goes ther wants to go to Atlantic CIty or something...RAR...

B&N is ok, everyone hates it there though, and the fukin cutomers blow moldy potatoes, i like most of the people i work wit though except Mike, damn he fukin pisses me off hes like 17 foot 20 and looks like a giant retarded green bean, hes so fukin sarcastic and condescending and granted im alil ditzy but iwork my ass off and excuse me if cappucinos do not give meaning to my life, and contrary to popular belief i have a brain, granted its a slightly defected at times but FUK U if I dont always wanna talk about the usurption of political upper class and their fascinating economic manuevers i dont give a shit bout the politics of a fucker who thinks he knows everything, andi hate politics cuz they piss me off, ill listen to other peoples opinions but usually its nto worth it to me to argue wit people bout it, i just care about different things that i htink matter more, watever hes a damn fucker and i cant wait till he leaves to go to grad school for poetry writing and the fine art of living wit a stick up your ass, have fun wit that,... besides him there r some interesting characters, theres this spanish guy who keeps asking me out but he comes on a lil too strong and his personality is not my type,watever i feel bad cuz he sent me a dozen roses to the cafe wen i was having a bad day, tres sweet but i just dun feel him, ah well, then theres two black guys who i think r very cute, One's Emmanuel hes just so nice to everyone and adorable but goddamn it i wish he were just nice to me lol...Emmmaannnnuelll will come to thee from Israelll, haha church song... anyways...

"event","Well right now I should be writing at least one of my 5 papers due this week.  Me being the procrastinator I am, I obviously am not.  Why? because I am an asshole.  SO instead I'm sitting here contemplating the problems of the universe like ooo I dunno what is the purpose of boogers...this is very important to me right now because I have a FUCKING cold... I've been sick so much lately... last week I had a stomach thingy which sucked because goddamnit if I'm gonna be puking my brains out for 24 hours y cant I at least lose weight.  I mean I am not a supporter of puking for hottness but cmon if I gotta do it anyway cant there be some positive effect... nope I GAINED 2 pounds,,, motherfuckers got mess wit me... thats ok, illl get them, Ill eat lots and lots so i LOSE weight cuz apparently my body doesnt like to be ""normal"" oh no it has to be specialll...GR... 

So I've figured out that I'm progressively losing my mind, no really.  I can't remember anything anymore... not my normal ditziness like teehee where oh where did i put my keys OH NO I mean I cant remember things, like ANYTHING... people will tell me things that happen and my only response is DUH? Not even normal forget memories, I barely remember last week...wat did I do last weekend , I dunno... I cant even remember half the people I hooked up wit in the last 2 years... wTF?? it really hasnt been THAT many...and my little niblets its getting worse... and I know wats causing it a) im crazier than a shithouse rat and b) alcohol... it really is killing my brain cells.. it goes in there and the brain cells say *zap*hi mr. alcohol*zap* (cause brain cells apparently speak in zapish) and Mr. alcohol says DIE MOTHAFUCKAS DIE MWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! (yes Mr. alcohol is evil) and they do, and its sad, and it makes ME ANGRY!!!! Cause I'll be told about these hilarious, great, or even tantalizingly retarded things that happened that i WAS THERE FOR, and I cant remember them.  Even last night I was told about various things that happened that I would LIKE to remember because they were cute and would make me happy in the dark little moments of my life... instead no no no no I am trapped... yup its a conspiracy I kno it is... I used to be proud of my ditziness cause its wat made me interesting but now now this is war... I expect that wen I drink massive amounts of alcohol and have blackouts ill have a couple fuzzy moments but when I THINK I remember the entire night and then find out I dont uh oh thats a problem... a real mofoin problem.  I know what your thinking, stop drinking and my response to that is NO... thats wat they want me to do... haha theyll see MWHAHAHAHAHAA.... I think mr. alcohol is making me evil... I dont want to be evil... *sigh*"

"event","SO first I should announce that I am fairly drunk.  Not quite ""drunk"" persay, but at that lovely little alcoholic level where one thinks ""fuck it, drink moreee"" but I dont have more so that's probaby a good thing.  

Anyways, I'm trying to read the bible for my COnversations of the West ( aka basically a history class) class and I'm just having difficuty doing it... I mean its actually kinda like dude this is soap opera drama, Noah and his posse were crazy mofos, I mean this one fucked her and him and they were second cousins and brothers at the same time... but I just can't concentrate so i decided to talk about my night...

SO tonight I hung out with Ninny again ( meaniing we chilled last night going buck nutty in her car, haha so much fun). I love Ninny she is tres fun. She was excited because it was like the first time she got to ride in the front  of a car instead of being a driver or backseater ( fuck you yes its a word). We've had alot of fun this weekend. Between crazy weird deep talks and stalking boys we thought we knew but didnt haha ( I still dont thing there was an old man in the group nin but watEVER).  Then while chilin with her we picked up becky and dropped her at her bf's house.  Then we picked up my gurlie Jen and her bf Scoot and his friend John.  THey are characters and a half.  WE drove around and then came back and drank at my house.  They just left at 5AM... Yeah parents are sleeping like ten feet away and we're drinking in my room... gotta love it.  Jen is one of my good friends from junior high.  We've had our ups and downs but she's an awesome person ( isn't scary that I'm using the word awesome???)... SO her bf is cool, I like him, at least most of the time when he's not setting me up wit assholes or making fun of me lol...and John was mad cool, we had drunken deep talks, ahh the drunken deep talks...However the true excitement today was trying to go to the Metropolitan Museum of ARt... You know when you really just want to get somewhere and get back but everything is FUCKED up, yeah that was one of those days... We ende up taking 6 trains to GET to the fucking museum,... I was HEATED, ready to stab someone up the fucking nostril... but we did get there and I got my assignment done... so with a lovely day like that ofcourse i had a cracked out night... ooo yes... on the way home my friend ciara left me a message saying, dude your voicemail on your cellie is crazy change it.. meanwhile she had set a message for me that I hadn't ( knowingly) changed , so I checked it, thinking that someone was fucking wit mt voicemail.  With the help of myt friend becky I discovered ( dun dun dun) that it was ME, drunken me, on my cellie, a very fucked up message I do not wish to share... then I'm parked infront of SCott's house and I hear an alarm going off and I think It's my car's becaues ninny had just pushed a button... oh no, after spending 5 minutes trying to stop it, and five minutes trying to make my dad help my stop it ( on the phone...) with him screamingat me that this is why he doesnt want me to have the car blah blah blah...I find out that it was house alarm... Am I an asshole, oh yes I think so............................. Ok so now I'm too drunk to finish the story or correct this entry... so enjoy it for all its glory and I'll try to write back tomorrow....

Well I got my car tonight, and by my car I mean my father's..."

"event","Ok just one more thing, well actually two. Ignore the title. I'm really and truly disturbed.  I mean sincerely. I think, *tear* I can't bear it...*sniffle*....dare I say...*sob* I think...I think ...SETH GREEN'S GAY!!!! WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Ok you don't understand. I love seth Green, I think he is the most adorable man on earth, I just wanna nibble him. It goes back to Buffy the Vampire SLayer, yea I used to love that show till it turned STUPID, goddamn what's his name the creator writer guy. So my favorite character was Oz (Sethie-poo). I just loved his character and therefore my love for Greenie blossomed like dainty offendingly neon yellow lily. But now, I'm watching PUNK'D on MTV, and Seth just seems gay. And I know gay. I have many a gay friend. And it makes me want to crawl under my bed and hummm. Yup, that depressed. SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME ITISNT TRUE!!!!! 

ANd the secodn thing is I think maybe I might hate Ashton Kucher. I dunno though.  I mean he's pretty funny on this Punk'd show but he seems like he might be a major asshole. Like one of those dufuses who loves to fuck with people and thinks he owns the world and you just wanna kick him in the balls, stupid fucker... but I dunno he might be a great guy ( yea, sure)... 

Ok NOW I'm goin to bed cause I'm tired and bitter, see Seth, see what you do to me. You make me take out my anger on poor Ashton, I just need ice cream now... NOW I'm gonna get FATTER!!! GODDAMNIT"

"event","SO tonight, this girl lisa that I was hanging out with got pranked on her cell phone.  I mean I'm all for pranking but make it entertaining. None of this duh haha suck my penis heehee. Um dadahuhduh? haha... I mean REALLY, how many brain cells did u just kill thinking up that one buddy.  Can you spell penis?... How high are you? See when MY friends prank we're hollarific.  MY friend Ciara pretends to be a southern bell whore...thats worthy.  Actually its FUCKIN hysterical. I can usually only do the angry prank, otherwise i'm spent.  If I cant say, stay the fuck away from my girl ( when I'm pretending to be lesbian) you odiferous scrotum hair, than I KNOW I shouldn't be wasting these people's time. GR. Yea, and the worst prank I ever got was when these people would just call my phone and not talk. Oh no, I dont mean something clever like mute, or breathing, or raspy little animal noises.  I mean I could hear people laughing in the background and this character on the phone listening to what I'm saying to my friend and giggling. Dude? Get a idea, or a life, whichever comes first...

SO there should be a mood for hugh-over...cause I am. Ever wake up drunk? Well, let me explain how it feels, first you think did I really drink that much, than when you try to count how many beers you had and your brain starts to make farting noises, you know you are still drunk.  Then when you feel the urge to pound your head through the wall, thats when you know you need to go back to sleep.

SPeaking of sleep, I think I shall. 

Ps- How much do I love Jamie Kennedy? Like a fat kid loves cake. Lmao I have no idea where I heard that line, but it cracks me up."

"event","SO, when I'm really pissed off or disturbed I either rant and rave (as you should know by now) OR I lose my mind ( yea the three melting brain cells I have left) and range from sobbing bag of snot to cackling psychopath (and by cackling I do mean cackling *cackly cackle* *eh hmm cough*) So anyway today I decided to share the shiet that cracks me up, why you ask? because I want to BITCH!!! See, I told you, I'm a scary mofo... ... ... BOO!!!

~>THE MOLE YUCATAN: f'in A makes me shiet my pants. Fuckin STeve Baldwin and CORBIN (NOOOOO CORBIN!!!) are my gods. By gods I mean I want to be them, both of them, sex change and all. If you don't know what I'm talking about watch the show, a very dear friend of mine (NINNY!!!) introduced me to the show that has soiled many a panty. *tear sob snot drip* now however... I am sad. Corbin(NOOOOO CORBIN!!!) has been... I can't bear it... EXILED!!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!! NOOOOO CORBIN!!! But watch the show anyway cause stevie-poo and wats his name ( not dennis bitch rodman) are still hella hysterical...

~>THE SPARK.COM: All I gotssta say is LMAO... yea I do so love that webpage. In the middle of the night some watch nick at nite, others eat large tubs of food-like product, still others watch crappy soft porn on cinemax, and still more others fuck their pillow.  I however, turn to the spark. If you dont like the quizzes, or enjoy they're creatively fucked-up questions, you must enjoy they're witty introductions and oooh so funny buttons. Oh I do love those buttons... clicking those clever little gray buttons *sigh*

~>BOY MEETS WORLD: Ok, so I'm slow on the hott shows, but I only started watching it when it was in re-runs. And I love it.  But my FAVORITE episodes are the later days when Eric turns REALLY stupid and is just completely cracked out( ha-ha my soulmate) Everytime he walks on the set I just die, I DIE. But my favorite episodes are the ones where Sean and Cory are having ""problems"" and act like a couple. If you dont understand you suck cause its funnayyyy.

~>SQUIRRELS: ... oh no wait they scare the SHIET OUTTA ME.  I dont care what you say, squirrels are EVIL!!! EVIL I TELL YOU!!! AH!!! RUN AWAY!! Um... I'll save this for a later storytime.

~>CRACKHEADS: Of all shapes, sizes, and odors. Today, one crackhead jumped onto the train tracks and stuck his hands under the metal track where, you know, mice and rats and god knows what else eat, shit, fuck, and wait to MAUL your hand off. He was looking for god knows what, probably his crack-needle (note my obsession with crack...hmm). I also enjoy crackheads who scream at me and my friends on the train for no particuar reason.  I know I kno its actually very sad but C'MON if your chattin wit your friends and are laughing and outta no where you HAR HAR HAR!!! YOu'd laugh to, you'd laugh to. Lastly my favorite crackers ( thats my word for crackheads not white people)  are my friends. TOo much to say... you'll see, oh dont worry you shall see.

~>My babies: My babies are my three precious darlings, Flashie, Tasha, and Jekyll (they're cats DUH ....moron...) They are truly MINE. I'm the only one who can pet them half the time, and I'm the one they sleep with(believe it or not they're skitzier than me... I know, dude?) Well, because I love them I torture them which MWAHAHAHAAA cracks me up. Just now in fact, I was feeeling Mwahahaish and decided to play jump over the kitty, so I did. It was a tres fun game till my big fat cat Jekie-poo decided fuck this and rolled out of the way ( yea, he's that fat) SO why do my little flowers still love me, why because I spoil them with food (hence the fatness) and I'm the only one in the house who will actually pet them, play with them, and let they're adorable gigantic fat asses lie on me and suffocate me closing off air to my lungs as I fall asleep. If you hear headline story "" Fat Ass Cat suffocates young woman"" yea peeps that's me. 

SO anyway these are just a few joys I find in life when I feel like mauling my earring because its partner has decided to take a trip to the world of goddamn lost fucking pieces of cocky, or throwing my dvd player into a pit of boiling tar because it wont fucking let me go down the menu I mean is it so fuking hard for the piece of shiet to let me SCROLL!!!!, or because I'm just having ONE of those days where you want to stab every heafer on the train with a flaming cigarette because they got on two stops after you but they are still sitting in the seat that has just opened up right in front of you but someone standing 10 people away managed to cram their khaki wearing hiney into that sexy little garbage covered neon orange seat GODDAMMIT!!! So, my little kittens find heart, or a cleaver and a shovel, which ever is easier for you. 

P.S.- Dont you love the words hence and maul?"

"event","Ok, so here I am eating my starburst (mmmm yum) minding my own business, TRYING to get over the goddamn ghost and I turn on a Martin Lawrence comedy special.  Now, I like MArtin Lawrence so I think ok let's watch. So, he's talking about racism. And I start thinking bout people acting retarded bout race. How its annoying and it goes all ways and its a waste of time.  I'm tired of being categorized as a white bitch cause I'm white, I mean I am a bitch, but why am i a WHITE bitch. Why not a red-headed wit blond and shit brown highlights bitch. OR a blue-eyed bitch.   Oh no, I have to be the gringa con grandes tetas(sorry cant spell tits in spanish), not chica con oyos azules ( again, spanish is not my best language... i'm not even sure if i said eyes...hmmm ponder) Anyway, my point is racism sucks, Martin Lawrence if you're readin( haha could you imagine) or any MArtin Lawrence worshippers, this is not cause of his jokes ( which I still laughed at) its just the idea. I have friends of all different races and ethnicities because we click not because of race, I'm even attracted to all different races, and I'm still treated like a ""white bitch"".  He keeps saying get over the racism hump, and alot of people still have racism issues (and if that's what you want fine thats your issue and I dont judge people like that, your thing is your thing) but nowadays it goes all ways, because everytime I turn down a guy of another ethnicity on the street cause he's hollarin "" HEY BIG BOOTY GIRL"" or "" TETASSS!!!"" I'm a white bitch. So screw you I am white and I am a bitch, but at least I'm NOT thinkin ""uh uh you dont got a chance cause your black"" ""I'm thinkin uh uh you dont got a chance cause you smell like rotten potatoes and cat turds and are yellin bout my booty ASSHOLE!!"" Ok so thats' my semi-serious rant. Moral: I dont like racism. I dont give it but I receive it ( hmm re-reading that sentence it sounds sexual...but its not, stay on the path this is important). And maybe more people on all sides would get over it faster if we ignored the people who are hung up on it and looked for the people who are pretty cool. Moral 2: If you doubted my dorkhood before, now it's reinforced cause I'm up at 1:30 pondering this shiet while watching ML pretend to be a crackhead ( just like me =) )"

"event","You know what I REALLY hate. Those emails. Yes, you know. THOSE emails. The ones that say blah blah blah, send to 12 and 1/2 people or your true love will never love you.  Yes. apparently these emails have the power to change the world. BY god, we could create anarchy or world catastrophes by not sending these emails.  I dont really mind those ones that have a cute message ( something inventive not duh duh ur my friend heehee) or are funny, or just plain interesting. At least add a nice rhyme, not a rhyme that is in every OTHER letter.  Those I dont mind forwarding because they have something worth sharing. Today, I got an email from two of my friends with one of those creepy stories, something like one day some friends were on vacation and little bobby took a picture of little john and then two minutes later little bobby DIED!!! then when the picture was developed there was a big bad scary ghostie in it!!!!and if you dont send this picture something super-de-duper bad will happen to you!! DUN DUN DUN..... WHY THE F*CK WOULD YOU SEND YOUR FRIENDS THAT SHIEEEETTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean really at least when you get the love bunny from 25 people it has a nice message if no substance or creativity... but this DIE DIE DIE shit a)blows and b) scares the shiet outta me.  I mean I'm one of those people who screams bloody murder when my friend says boo ( or as danielle once did: kicks open the bathroom door while i was taking a piss....dupid bytch) Anyway, why would you send any of your friends such an email especially someone who is a skitzo ( like me). SO the moral of the story my little darlings is dont send these god damn emails and dont believe what they say cause they are a gigantic bubbling crock of shiet. ( How do I know, because when I was 13 I was a dork who thought these forwards could make that special someone notice me... a million forwards later I have found that its a load of stinky poo... so I'm no longer a dork who forwards junk, I am now, just a dork.)"

"event","Yea so, please excuse my grammar and repeating errors in the last journal entry (and in the first one for that matter) LJ and I were apparently battling it out...and LJ won...also I would like to state for the record that I am not talking about any loudmouth in particuar so if you feel that you are X loudmouth and that you happen to know Mr. Joe Needlehead or that you are Joe Needlehead...well you dont and you're not.. Joe Needlehead is just a Joe Schmoe and no, you are not that Schmoe, you moe..."

"event","I always stay up really late for no reason.  At least when school starts again I'll have a reason.  For some strange reason I'm kind of looking forward to school, maybe just because I want to meet more people that actually go to my college, ya know not feel like a LOSER anymore haha... I should just become one of those people who never shuts up, you know those really annoying people you want to kill when your waiting online or to get your nails done, and you can hear them from the other side of the room, and they're blabbing about when their kitchen tile chipped or when joe needlehead never called them back, but then he did, and then HOW BOUT THEY KILL THEMSELVES.... but anyway I should be like that and just talk to everyone, I mean half the school may hate me but that still leaves a couple thousand or so that will be my friends... yea I shouldnt stay up past 12 because I become delirious and start talking about things that dont make any sense. Wow I've only used like two periods in this entire entry... Now I dont even know what the hell Im talking about.  Hey, are we allowed to curse in these things? WELL, I hope so haha. ALright I'm going to bed now, and maybe tomorrow I'll actually do something exciting like I dunno, leave my house, chase a squirrel, something. Last week I went out alot. I hung out with my friend Daniella a couple times who I hadnt seen for like 6 months.  It was pretty fun, but she kept bringing me to hang out with her ex-boyfriends and their crackhead friends. DOnt get me wrong chillin wit crackheads is as much fun as any other group, i just found it interesting that they were All crackheads. And I hung out wit my other gurlies at my house off and on.  The best nite was probaby sat, when we filled the opium den and came back from going out for margaritas and really yummy cheesy rice (mmmm)and drankeded more and talked about masterbation and the birds and the bees (wat am i gonna do wit out my gurlies when they all leave me!!!)  ALright I'm going to bed now, and maybe tomorrow I'll actually do something really exciting like I dunno, leave my house, chase a squirrel, climb a tree, something.  Look forward to my exciting adventures this week, or not."

"event","Ok, first of all, the signing up part of livejournal that identifies our humaness ( however thats spelled) CRACKED me up, oh yea. Well other than that I'm on college break trying to clean out my opium den (and by opium den i mean CIGARETTE filled pig-sty)... most of my friends have already gone back to college *tear* ah how i miss danda yelling at me and smoking wit me, and ""telling"" me when shes coming over, and ninny constantly telling me how retarded I am and both of them making decisions for me, like what to wear, what to eat and all the other stuff that my brain is to fried to figure out. Oh, and just in case your wondering, no, no i am not an ""official"" crackhead, I'm just reatarded in so many ways, lord knows how I survive in school.  I think I use up all my brain cells there. I also miss my friends that have started high school again, cause well I never get to see them, DAMN CURFEWS AND HOMEWORK, my poor ci-ci-ta and becky-meng. AS you can tell I have nicknames for all my friends ( or most of them). Wel, other than that no terribly exciting tales, I kno, how do I live with myself, well I live vicariously through my friends, TRY to go out alot, and read a whole bunch.  SO keep reading, you never know when naked midgets and farm animals may pop-up.  Oh and p.s. my name is T'ara, no not tara, T'ara, or as my friends say TAWA AND i do so love the mood chipper HAHA"

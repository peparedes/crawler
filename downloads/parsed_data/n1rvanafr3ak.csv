"event","<P>It's official, I am officially moved into my new enviornment.&nbsp; Things have just been going down hill since I found out about the move.&nbsp; I talked to my girlfriend.&nbsp; I love her to death, but we both have doubts about our relationship with us being that far away.&nbsp; I would do anything for her, and she knows this, but at the same time I am so far away from her, and I can't be there for her.&nbsp; That isn't fair to her.&nbsp; She needs someone who can be there for her when she needs them.&nbsp; Not someone that she will have to wait to see until they can find time to come back to her.&nbsp; It was the hardest decision that I have ever made.&nbsp; I told her all of that, and it was so hard.&nbsp; I cried as I told her, and she cried and just layed in my arms.&nbsp; I felt so helpless, and at that very moment, so alone.&nbsp; She was pretty much my whole life, and I just never realized it.&nbsp; I never knew how much I really cared about her, until I had to let her go.&nbsp; Until I had to let her go on and find someone she can really be with.&nbsp; Someone who is physically there to support her when she needs it.</P>
<P>Since than I just havn't felt like going out.&nbsp; My guys threw me one hell of a going away party, but I just didn't really get into to it too much.&nbsp; My last day with Julie was the best/worst day of my life.&nbsp; It was something that I don't want to forget, but at the same time I want to forget all of the pain I had that day.&nbsp; I want to get rid of all of this pain I feel right now.&nbsp; I don't want to feel alone, and she was the only person that it feels like was keeping me alive.&nbsp; Not litterally, but with my emotions.&nbsp; It's just so hard.&nbsp; I love her so much, and I miss all of my friends, but right now she is the only person that I can think of.&nbsp; The only person that I didn't want to leave for good.&nbsp; Maybe after I get a decent job out here, and save up money, I can move back there.&nbsp; Back there to be with her.&nbsp; I won't get my hopes up to high.&nbsp; She might have found someone else by than.&nbsp; I can't go back there to find that out.&nbsp; I can't even talk to her on the phone or online right now.&nbsp; It's just too hard.&nbsp; Too hard to know that I just left the love of my life.&nbsp; I was trying to block all of it out.&nbsp; The fact that I knew I would have to do this when I left, and I just didn't want to think of it.</P>"

"event","So... In my last entry... as most of you know... I found out that I may be moving to Ohio.&nbsp; Well, that chance is very well good.&nbsp; My parents found a place out there, and I was there over the weekend, and it was just so lonely out there.&nbsp; I have no one.&nbsp; No one to share my thoughts with, no one to talk to, just no one to go out be a dumbass with, and have a good time.&nbsp; No more music with my boys, no more parties.&nbsp; No more getting drunk with my close friends, and random sex with girls I don't even know.&nbsp; Well, I'm sure that will happen again.&nbsp; Atleast the sex part haha... but there is nothing for me there.&nbsp; Nothing to peak my interests, and I have to move out there if they close the deal on that house.&nbsp; If I do go though, there is going to be one hell of a party that way, no one will <STRONG>EVER </STRONG>forget me."

"event","I found out that I might be moving within the next few months.&nbsp; It's not like a normal move where you move 3 streets away from where you live now, but It's more like 3 states or so away from where I live now.&nbsp; My dad got a job offer in Ohio, so I might have to move with him there, unless my friends want to go in on an apartment with me.&nbsp; Let's hope they do."

"event","I don't use this thing enough.&nbsp; Well, I went out and got all kinds of fucked up the other night, and went on stage for the performance.&nbsp; Did pretty well, and than after that I went out with the guys, and got even worse than I already was.&nbsp; I was so smoked out before we even started the show.&nbsp; After we went out and got drunk and did shrooms, and smoked more.&nbsp; My night was so crazy!"

"event","<P>First entry, and I want anyone who reads this that finds me interesting in any way to add me.&nbsp; I want to meet new people who like to do what I do, or people that have the same interests.&nbsp;</P>
<P>First off, I'm one of the biggest pot heads you'll find.&nbsp; Anything you can smoke out of, I got it.&nbsp; I'm in a band, and we're not bad.&nbsp; That's not just from my point, others have told us this, and it rocks!&nbsp; I play guitar, bass guitar.&nbsp; I broke up with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; Well, it was more like a mutual thing, but I was the one that brought it up.&nbsp; We both felt like we were going out seperate ways, and she felt like I didn't have time for her when it came to my band, which I don't understand, because I was with her all the time, whenever she wanted me to.&nbsp; Oh well,&nbsp; it still hurts and I'm getting over it.&nbsp; I might have brought it up, and it might have been mutual, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt.&nbsp; I just gotta look into my future, and hopefully get this band thing on the go.</P>
<P>Well looks like I have to go to practice...&nbsp; fun fun...</P>
<P>Rock on and keep it real,</P>
<P>Frank</P>"

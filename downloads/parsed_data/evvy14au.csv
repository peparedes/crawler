"event","Sara Bareilles Love Song Lyrics

Head underwater
And they tell me 
To breathe easy for a while
Breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me; but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', 
Imma need a better reason 
To write you a love song today (today)

I learned the hard way
That they all say 
Things you want to hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and
Your twisted words,
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry

Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am


I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin',
Imma need a better reason 
To write you a love song today

Promise me that you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone
'cause I believe there's a way you can love me
Because I say
I won't write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or break in this
Is that why you wanted a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that
There's a reason to
Write you a love song today"

"event","So...I'm kind of sad (in a weird way).  I have been thinking about the future a lot and just how much I don't want to leave Auburn in a little over a year.  I love it here and I love my friends sooooo much; it's not like I'm about to leave. I don't know, for some reason I'm just sentimental about the thought of leaving lately.  Maybe it's the fact that the reality of how little time I have left here is starting to hit me. Well, haha, okay that sounds depressing; I'm going to go visit with my friends now.  Time for Grey's Anatomy...my first time watching (fun time with Margs and Tap). I'm sure I'll really type soon; I know I've gotten lazy with this."

"event","This is just too good not to pass on, if I may humbly say so.  An excerpt from Janet's blog
 
31.4 miles south of Macon on I-75 

Perry, Georgia. Yes that is a sentence/complete thought. Those two words say a lot. I have come to understand much about this haven of the south since moving to Macon nine years ago. The purpose of this post is to explain my sheer and utter excitement upon being informed of some life altering information by one of my favorite fellow bloggers and honorary sons of Perry, Bradleyj. Today was one of those days in the life of a blogger where I assumed that there really was nothing to blog about. All that has changed. I exchanged emails with above mentioned friend applauding him over his current blog material and activity. I confessed some hint of jealousy was present in my own life due to the massive amounts of activity and comments that he receives on a daily basis on his blog. Now to the life changing news I received. He informed me that many of the ""Perry people"" read my blog but do not comment. Some of you are saying ""ok so some people from Perry read your blog, big deal."" To those of you who say that, shame on you...wash your mouths out with soap! The ever so cool thing is that through various parties, pictures, stories, weddings, and the occasional introductions I have been fortunate, and may even say blessed, enough to encounter ""Perry people."" As a side note when one of my best friends married a ""Perry person"" (I'll call him ""Shep"") I knew that my take on these people was correct when I met him. He is quality!

Allow me to enlighten you as to the rare find that I call ""Perry people."" 
Perry people are first and foremost, southern. Not redneck or country. This means that they are polite, well dressed, have impeccable manners, poised, and my favorite thing about them....they are CHARMING. A Perry person does not over take a room by being the loudest or most obnoxious...their command of a crowd is subtle and they draw in people with shear charisma--once again very charming. A Perry Person has a natural ability to make everyone feel welcome, even the outsider...trust me Macon folks...we are outsiders...they just never let you know it. A Perry Person always has a witty story to share about something from their past that just makes you wish your parents had moved you to Perry as a child or that you were by some divine appointment placed on their hall when you went to UGA. Perry people are successful but never brag. They are loyal and close to family and friends. Perry people are God fearing but never cram their beliefs down your throat. All in all these beings are a class act. And I for one am honored to know that they give my futile attempts at blogging a glance whether they post comments or not. 

To the phantom Perry people who read this blog...Thank you for giving my day a glimmer of meaning. Don't be angry with bradleyj for ratting you out...he was just being a typical Perry person by encouraging me.

God Bless America and God Bless Perry, Georgia.

**The author of this blog would gratefully accept ""most"" proposals from any man that could promise her a life in the Perry inner circle. Obviously an appropriate courtship and compatibility are prerequisites. All inquires should be made through bradleyj.

""I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.  And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge - that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.""

You are attracted to good manners and elegance.

In love, you feel the most alive when your partner is patient and never willing to give up on you.

You'd like to your lover to think you are loyal and faithful... that you'll never change.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was insecure and in constant need of reassurance.

Your ideal relationship is traditional. Without saying anything, both of you communicate with your hearts.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage as something that will confine you. You are afraid of marriage.

In this moment, you think of love as commitment. Love only works when both people are totally devoted.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>"

"event","I have been so happy to be back at Auburn and be with my friends that I have overlooked some situations. A few nights ago I sort of had a little melt down- I just cried before the Lord (about some of those situations which had surfaced).  It was nothing serious I was just broken for a few people I deeply care about.  I am telling you this not to get a pitty party, but to tell you about the faithfulness of the Lord.  The next day I heard a sermon out of the book of Galatians.  My pastor talked about Paul's thorn in the flesh and the many opinions that different scholars, pastors, and other people had about what actually caused Paul's thorn of the flesh.  As he read the scripture about the thorn of the flesh he concluded that he thought the thorn of the flesh was Paul's eyesight.  Paul showed concern for the Galatians and instead of them receiving him they began to stone him until they thought he was dead.  The only way he was revived was by a circle of Christians who gathered round him.  He could not survive without other Christians encouraging and praying for him.  We are not meant to walk our Christian walk alone.  Christ is always with us, and He will never fail you.  He has also blessed us with fellowship (just as Paul had).  Paul was concerned for the Galatians and he asked, ""have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth""? (Gal. 4:16)  Paul reached out to Christians who were deceived by Satan (even though there was a possibility he could be hurt by them).  When you truly love others you have to know that hurt will accompany that love.  People will let you down and hurt you, but we must realize that the hurt is worth it if someone is saved, ministered to, or helped in any way because you sacrificed yourself for them (becoming more Christ-like).  We are given the responsibility and the privilege to watch over each other.  You are your brother's keeper.  
There are 4 truths about being your brother's keeper:
1.  You have to put truth above friendship (don't be selfish)
2.  Making a difference in peoples' lives always involves being hurt (love is hurt- expose Satan's lies.  Never approach anyone except unselfishly and out of love.)
3.  We need to express empathy with one another while confronting them (do it with humility)
4.  We are given responsibility from God to watch each other's souls
The Lord gave me this right when I felt completely alone and overwhelmed.  Isn't He faithful (Psalm 18:32)?  I want to model myself, even more then I have been, after Paul; no matter what my (thorn in the flesh) ailment could be, the people I care about are worth the hurt.  Are you willing to sacrifice yourself?  I can not explain to you how much this sermon encouraged me- isn't it amazing to see the Lord listen and speak to you.  I hope this encourages you.  ""Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God...how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?"" Gal. 4:8-9"

"event","Well, I am currently back at Auburn- there has already been SO much that has happened since I have returned.  This will prob. be real brief (I will have to get better at updating this so it's not too much to read or write).  My sister is at Auburn with me now, which is real fun.  I feel like a freshman again in a weird way (due to some sacrafices I've made for her).  We are in the same 8:00 a.m. class on TR, I eat at Terrel on the Hill with her, and I just get to experience the whole freshman outlook through her eyes (getting lost trying to get to class, meeting friends, wondering how to get to Walmart, etc...).  It really is fun though.  She just pledge ADPI, and I am thrilled.  I was a recruitment counselor this year at rush, and I loved it!!!  It was so neat to lead a group of 16 young women through rush, and showing them their first glimpse of Auburn!  The first week of classes has come and gone and I am being thrown back into the fast pace lifestyle of the fall.  I am currently enrolled in 18 hrs. for this semester, which I'll prob. vent about in a few months.  Hopefully, I can stay focused.  I am nerd; I am actually excited about some of the classes in my major this semester(which really isn't my personality).  Anyways, that is a BRIEF synapses on what is happening in my semester so far, just incase you are wondering."

"event","You know, I have not written on this in forever (I would of course choose to do it on prob. one of the busiest nights of the summer).  I really do not know why when I am the busiest I must preoccupy myself with something else to do and get even more behind on what I should be accomplishing.  As I begin/should be finishing my packing for Auburn, I can not help but reminisce on the past summer.  I had a wonderful summer!  It was SO good to be home; the funny thing is home was the last place I wanted to be this summer.  I had plans to go to Colorado, but I am glad God had different and better plans then I had for myself.  Right when you think you have something planned out have you ever noticed the plan's God has for you most likely are complete opposite then what you had in mind (you have a sketched out plan but God has a drawn up blueprint).  I worked with the youth at First Baptist in Perry.  One of my favorite memories from interning is a small discipleship group I got to have with a group of about 8 girls (called Alpha Omega- Rev. 21:6).  The group met once or twice a week and we talked about how to become a godly woman.  I have such a heart for girls, but esp. these young ladies.  It has been so encouraging to watch these girls grow just in this summer alone. It is so funny though because I feel so warn, but in the same aspect, refreshed.  I know that prob. does not make a lot of sense; it is somewhat hard to explain/understand unless you have been there.  I feel warn physically (esp. with our big luau being last night), mentally, and spiritually.  Satan has attacked me SO much this summer.  He has attacked me a lot mentally, which he always does, but he has pursued my mind even more then usual this summer.  Thoughts such as, ""have you made a difference in these kids life,"" ""how do you know everything about the Bible is true, are you sure,"" ""doubt God, are you sure He has the best for you, how good can it be,"" all of which I know are lies, but goodness does he enjoy messing with me.  That is one reason I love that verse from the Casting Crowns song that goes, ""but the voice of truth tells me a different story.""  I guess it is good to be under attack because that means you must be doing something right.  At the same time I have been refreshed this summer by family, old and new friends, and walking deeper with the Lord and being exposed/learning about certain things I never dreamed of knowing about.  One of the most intriguing thoughts about this summer is how fast it has come and gone; it was here and gone with the blink of an eye.  The cliche ""time flys""  has never been more true, and it has made me wonder what does the Lord want from me personally.  Life is soooo short, and in the time it takes me to double my age right now I will be 1/2 way done with my life.  I have so much to learn, do, and live out in general.  We are only here for a short season.  I guess you could just say I am refreshed in I want to live life to the fullest and figure out what God wants to do with my life.  What is His plan for me and how much of it can I know and what will I have to find out as I go?"

"event","Well...I just decided to get this live journal thing after enjoying reading Krisan, Anna, and Lilley's journals occasionally.  They have inspired me to start my own.  Of course, I would join this during the exam period of my spring semester '05; oh well, that's just how I roll!  I started the face book during exams last semester, oh...procrastination!!!  Today was the 1st of the 2 dead days here at Auburn.  Unfortunately for me today was not that productive!  I basically have been moving out, running errands, and ""somewhat/semi"" studying."" Okay, weird, my roommate (Smash) just informed me that we are now JUNIORS in college (I guess not technically till  exams are over with in a week)! WEIRD!!! Are we really that old?!? There is no way! Well...I guess that is enough for my first time on live journal, I'm going to sleep.  Night!"

"event","So, today was pretty cool (i'm gonna try to do the Andrew thing where i keep this journal up regularly)

I woke up at like 9 (no school for me!) then practiced piano for like 2 and a half hours, fun stuff.   Then I went and picked up Kari and we went to the gym, which is nice because she has a membership now and I have someone to talk/whine to when we work out, and she has a reason to work out. 

After we went home and I showered (she showered at the gym) we both caved and went to Sammy T's for lunch. Mmmmm....it's pretty healthy food, just not in the portions we ate, lol.  Afterwards I gave Josh a call, dropped Kari off and went home to jam. 
It's been a while since Josh and I got together, and I always forget how freakin' great he is, gotta love that guy.
We eventually decided jamming was tiresome without a bass player and headed to the mall so he could wail on guitars and I could buy drumsticks and get headphones.  After we jammed again at Guitar Center, we headed to get Josh some clothes cuz he has some senior crap to do tomorrow, some kind of ceremony.  After that we went to Wendy's.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich, part of a side salad and a diet coke.  Josh had  two spicy chicken sandwiches, a large thing of fries and a large Dr. Pepper....why am I the fat one?

newho, then josh came home and we packed up his stuff and I went by Kari's to say goodnite.  I love her......it's craziness, good craziness. 
that's about it, overall a fairly fulfilling day, hopefully my summer will be like this, only with more practicing of the drums, etc;"

"event","Looking back on that post, it could be offensive, let me reiterate:
I doubt many people read this, but judging by the fact that I recently discovered some of you spend more time on LJ than i thought, there are a lot of people who MIGHT read this (but probably won't) that I'd like to consider friends:
Andrew (The Great), Kathrin, Sam, Ben, Taylor
there might be more but if i forgot you and you're offended than you're probably a friend and i just didn't know you had LJ, i don't know why i'm specifying this anyway, but i guess it's just random.

I really do like more people than i dislike, despite all my insanities.

"event","LOL,
I take back all that whiny crap.

Yesterday I went downtown and had a talk with Dr. Sizemore (sp?) the pastor/preacher at Jessica's (and now my) church, Fairview Baptist.  He's a real nice guy and I'm so happy I went.  All the earthly things that upset me before seem so unjustified and people seem so... insignificant?  I dunno, that's probably not the right word.  I'm just gonna live my life the best way I know how.  As far as I can tell at this point, the people who don't care about me aren't worth worrying about and I'll concentrate on keeping the few friends I've got.  What's funny is that, with the possible exception of Kari, there isn't a soul that will read this that I consider a friend.  I'm so glad that I'm free from the state of mind in which I judged other people and was judged by those same people.  It's no one's place to judge another person.  All I can do is love those that love me back and take the rest of life with a grain of salt.
- Sam

P.s.  It's funny how quickly people change to meet arbitrary expectations placed upon them by their ""friends"" that don't love them unless they fall in line.  It's not my job to judge but I imagine there's a special place in hell reserved for conformists and those who give up their free will to the rest of society, and I'll never be that way again."

i just worry i'll leave this place and die somewhere unhappy and no one will be better for having known me.  i love you people so damn much, just maybe i can't figure me out sometimes.  ugh, that made no sense.  Life sometimes seems so hopeless but there's something and someone out there that's gonna make it possible for people like me to make a difference and find happiness i hope i hope i hope."

"event","So it's like me first entry in 2 or 3 months.  Family Guy is back on the air, that's awesome, and I've learned a lot lately.  I'm really thankful for friends, you know who you are, the ones that have been there for me lately.  I'm gonna try and get back to doing this writing thing regularly

Goals for now til college:
1) Get in shape
2) practice, practice practice
3) build better relationships with the people (and deity) that I have long taken for granted.

"event","Ok, so my first audition is Saturday.....AHHH!!!!
There is sooo much to do.  I'm gonna ask Koch if I can use a practice room during band and work on my timpani solo.  I'm not that worried about it, but I need to get that and the snare solo down really well cuz the marimba piece(s) are gonna be kinda rough.  They're good, but rough.  Anywho, I hope they ask me to play some drumset, and I hope even harder that I get a scholarship of some sort. Meh. Hope Hope Hope.  The only way I'm going to WVU is on a scholarship, so I really hope I get one, cuz Troy State would be kind of bleak for performance. Starting to wish I had checked out UNT a little harder, but meh.  I'd really rather go to WVU right now and then to UNT for graduate studies.  After all, this will give me a more well-rounded approach to percussion....at least that's the excuse I'm going with.  So anywho, I'm stressed and sick and coughing and bleh and the couch is calling me to it, so off to bed.

"event","This is incredible.&nbsp; By which I mean incredibly pathetic.&nbsp; I managed to wait until the night before we actually have to go back to school after four days, (count them: 1-2-3-4) without school, just to start my timed write that was due before we left.&nbsp; Wow. Okay, that aside it's 2:10 a.m. and I just finished doing the timed write and memorizing a monologue about lingerie for drama.&nbsp; Good stuff.&nbsp; It's about some jerk Hollywood film producer that wants his sweet Georgia girlfriend to put on some lingerie for him and then, well, yeah.....and she doesn't want to, so he goes off on a rant.&nbsp; Funny stuff, the character is so dumb, but eerily accurate, because it sounds like a lot of guys when we're pissed about something absurd.&nbsp; Meh.&nbsp; So anywho, yeah, off to bed.&nbsp; Went to Andy's shin-dig today (as it was officially christened by both levels of Sam-age, both main and auxilliary an official shin-dig).&nbsp; That was random and&nbsp;very awesome.&nbsp; Got to the gym, good stuff.&nbsp; O, and I practiced marimba for college audtions.&nbsp; My first one is a week from this Saturday, and I am freaking <STRONG>out<EM>.&nbsp; </EM></STRONG>So yeah, off to bed for 2 1/2 hours sleep before more gym.&nbsp; Meh, I'll just sleep in 7th period......and sixth....maybe more, we'll see.

"event","Can't believe they called school today.  Great, though, right? awesome, indeed.

So, for those who don't know:

NEW EXAM SCHEDULE
Exam Review Wednesday January 26  Exam 1 Thursday--Exams 2 & 7 Friday
Exams 3 & 6 Monday January 31 & Exams 4 & 5 Tuesday February 1
Report Cards Distributed Tuesday February 8

That's freakin' awesome, we get another day of review.  That means I am TOTALLY not doing anything until Wednesday night.  Laziness is equal to the amount of happiness divided by the amount of pain caused by the impending laziness.  That's the only freakin' formula I need to remember.  Hmm.. I said freakin' instead of cussing.  That's odd, maybe I'm turning over a new leaf.  I hope it's one of those big, cool-looking leaves, not the gross kind that have been deteorating and have and larvae all over the bottom, that would be dissapointing.  Wow, you people need to be online more.  I have a 17 buddies online, and 14 are away, wtwo are on cell phones, and 1 is idle. *slow clap*.  So anywho, going to Andy's at 3 for pizza and movies...mmm......movies.  Such small pleasure, such great joy.  I'm hungry, but I know we're eating there, so I'll wait, but that means less pizza for all of you, mwa ha ha ha.  Aw, now I feel fat.  LOL. So I'm going to hang with Kari, which is equal to joy, so I hope all of you receive red balloons on the fourth Tuesday in January, tah tah."

"event","So, today was <STRONG>ambivalent - </STRONG>adj 1: characterized by a mixture of opposite feelings or attitudes; (Dictionary.Com)&nbsp; <BR><BR>I woke up 10-ish, called Josh, no answer.&nbsp; I called Dan and confirmed everything, then Josh called.&nbsp; No practice, because his rents say the roads are too bad.&nbsp; Shame, we needed the practice, so Kyle called and I told him.&nbsp; Dan wasn't so lucky and showed up and I had to turn right around and take him home.&nbsp; That was lame.&nbsp; On the way to his house I had a bitch session about the band.&nbsp; I'm a whiny bastard sometimes.&nbsp; It just bugs me because everything I do and practically every dollar I spend goes towards the band or equipment or something.&nbsp; I give rides, organize gigs and all the practices, everything,&nbsp; all I really ask of anyone is to show up, write and play music.&nbsp; Everyone is so talented, I don't understand the lack of motivation.&nbsp; Kyle is a phenomenal bassist, Josh is probably the best guitarist for his age in this state, and Dan's a great player all around.&nbsp; Sometimes it just seems like we're letting it go to waste because we simply refuse to find the time to practice.&nbsp; We could be so great, at least on the local scene, but no, we can't find time to practice, urgh.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Okay, I swear I'm done with that now.&nbsp; Anywho, after that I heard school was cancelled tomorrow (actually now it's today, Monday).&nbsp; Met Kari and Mike and her mom at Pizza Hut, that was cool, first thing I'd had to eat that day.&nbsp; Then Kari and I went back to my house and she hung out and did HW while I worked on cleaning my room.&nbsp; LOL, it took 5 hours for me to organize my school notebooks and music.&nbsp; That's sad.&nbsp; This really must happen more than once every 4 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plus side, It's 2 a.m. and I'm almost about to be done, heh heh heh *pulls collar* that's funny.&nbsp; (hence the heh heh heh).&nbsp; My book shelves are going to be organized *gasp*, so is all my music *double gasp*.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll actually have a place for my clothes to be put away now too.&nbsp; That's <EM>never</EM> happened.&nbsp; <STRONG><EM>EVER.</EM></STRONG>&nbsp; Tells you what a neat freak I am.&nbsp; Not.&nbsp; I'm such a pack-rat.&nbsp; I realized that today when I found about 80 comics that were all 10 years old.&nbsp; I'm going to sell those and my magic cards to nerds at school so I can get some more room in here.&nbsp; After organizing and cleaning in here, maybe I'll actually fold out the couch into a bed.&nbsp; Meh, we'll see.&nbsp; I'm just rambling now, Oh yeah, Kari and I went to Borders and I got Queen's greatest hits and Red Hot Chili Peppers greatest hits.&nbsp; I ran into Jason (old drum teacher) there, which was cool.&nbsp; While I was talking to him Kari went off and bought me the soundtrack to <EM>In Good Company </EM>Since we went and saw that the other night and I wouldn't shut up about the percussion they had on the soundtrack.&nbsp; It's soooo good.&nbsp; One of the songs is all African drums and xylophone, vibes, and marimba......awesome.&nbsp; So yeah, after I cleaned some more we went to her house and watched <EM>Garden State</EM>.&nbsp; Great movie, I highly recommend it to.....well, yeah everyone.&nbsp; Gooooood movie.&nbsp; Okay, on that note I'm still cleaning, so..the end? for now? meh..."

<P>Woke up at 9 or 930-ish to Kari's call, though I don't remember much of what was said, I am&nbsp;<STRONG>not</STRONG> a morning person. </P>
<P>Afterwards,&nbsp;went to work, got there by 10. James (Roberson) said we might close early due to the snow.&nbsp; Not many people came, probably fear of weather.&nbsp; VA people are such wimps when it come to weather.&nbsp; Got to talk to Toby and Rik, that's always a plus.&nbsp; I want to be them.&nbsp; They're the most talented people I know and they're so close to the big time they can taste it.&nbsp; That's the feeling I've been waiting for since I picked up a pair of drumsticks.&nbsp; That's really my purpose, in music, in life, to effect others in such a way that they examine their lives and appreciate them more or they do something about them to better themselves and/or the world.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Anywho, I went to&nbsp; 7-11 and got some hot chocolate and a taquito, an I ate Kari's left over Red Lobster from friday mmmmmm....good stuff.&nbsp; Then James and I watched Dennis Chambers play with Niacin (Billy Sheehan rocks).&nbsp; That made&nbsp; me want to play so bad.&nbsp; Josh and I have been doing this band thing forever and I want it to go somewhere so badly.&nbsp; Maybe we need&nbsp;to try out more people.&nbsp; Or maybe Josh needs to learn all the songs he wants to play, actually, so do I, so that's not a fair criticism....in any case, we need to get our crap together and get something done.&nbsp; We owe it to ourselves as musicians.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Dad called eventually and said to come home because the snow was bad.&nbsp; Big joke that turned out to be.&nbsp; Mom sent me to the store, I picked up Kari and we went grocery shopping at Giant.&nbsp; She's a real sweet-heart, on so many levels.&nbsp; Then we went to Subway, I got a Chicken Pizziola, she got a Turkey sub, then we came back and watched <U>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. </U>Mmmm.... Jim Carrey.&nbsp; Anywho, we liked it, I got in some marimba practice for college auditions, thought some about what I want to do for culminating.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Culiminating, ugh.&nbsp; I don't know if I want to write another book.&nbsp; If I do, it would be more of a method and a history thing with less focus on me writing pieces.&nbsp; I think I would focus on the origins and history of the instrument and the field of keyboard percussion and then include exercises and technique instruction.&nbsp; For my presentation I could learn two pieces of contrasting styles, a classical piece and a Japanese, modernistic style piece.&nbsp; Maybe? meh.<BR><BR>So I took her home, we watched some TV and then I came&nbsp;home and got online.&nbsp; Good stuff. I like my life, I just want to practice more music.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be great to be the best in the world? I think it would.&nbsp; Not just at drumset or marimba or snare, but at percussion.&nbsp; To be the world's greatest all-around percussionist, hand drumming, cymbals, the whole nine yards.&nbsp; <BR>Anywho, I""m off, so toodles and hopefully I'll keep this up.</P>"

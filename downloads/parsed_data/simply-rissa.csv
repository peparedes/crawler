"event","well break is almost to a close. it was not the best break but sumthings happened that made me happier and sum that fucking burned my self esteem. i wanna share waht i learned...

taking a chance on summin that you want. is the best thing to do. when you finally achieve it. you feel so relieved. my parents got divorced when i was going into 7th. my dad hide alot from me. and i found it. condoms and all that nasty shit you wouldnt wanna see your father have. you name it i prolly found it in the first time i went to his house. i confronted him. i told him he needs to hide his life or tell me the fucking truth.felt good to get that off my chest. my lesson to you is when you want summin. go for it.

another thing..you are you worst critic. you`ll never see yourself likes others do. people are gunna point out your problems and you are just gunna have to look past them.everyone is beautiful in their own way. you have to find the beauty in yourself before anyone else can.

another one..life isnt perfect. no ones life is. once you realize that you will be a whole lot happier. my mom n brother think people have the perfect life and always complain to me that they hate their life. honestly i love mine. and i hate them for hating theres. they or anyone out there hasta realize no matter how bad you have it theres one person out there or more that have it worse.

and tha last thing. im always here for all of you. i love to give advice. and wheather or not you are my friend or you`ve talked to me before.im here just im me or leave a comment.

*if you are reading this and think im incredibly stupid or summin dont leave a rude comment. i spilled it out and you have the nerve to leave a mean comment dont do it*

riss"

"event","okay, so mel+samm slept over last night. we were all in my twin bed and samm was falling off the front of the bed, and i was falling in the ""crack"" between the wall n the bed. mel n samm kept pushing me, and i fall all the way in, mel n samm are cracking up and im like crying n screaming cause, my chest was squashed. and they didnt realize that i was sooo far in and i couldnt get out. so i finally push myself againist the wall and move the bed, samm n mel are still laughing and not helping me. i was in so much pain and FINALLy samm goes and turn the light on, mel sees that i fell so much and they help me out finally after taking pic*s of me in the ""crack"" . and my mom comes in and starts screaming at us to go downstairs and sleep there cuz were too loud, HEY! i fell!! we slept in the basement. after that. nothing else happened. i thought sum of you`d get a kick outta that horrible story =(. i`ll post the pics when mel sends them to me.

"event","okaa. that entry before. the poll about being pretty.one comment hit me hard. i felt like that was the only honest one, maybe you guys think i`m pretty but this person, i think i kno who it was, made me feel so horrible that tha face i saw in the mirror had changed. i had self esteem for a few hours and then hearing that i kinda definatly let it get to me. the things that she mentioned were what i was trying to forget bout, they friggen basically told me i was fat, and i was just telling myself that last night! now i know thats what everyone else thinks too. they were like alot of other people think this stuff to, you just dont hear it cuz its like behind my back!!! i can tell this person is actaully a friend of mine, because they told me they have said it before. so i think i know who and im gunna call them tonight and ask them if it was them, if it was you. thank you for being honest. if you are a friend of mine, call me i`d like to talk to you, and if you still dont wanna tell me it was you dont comment on here again because honestly i want my friends to tell me tha truth and not let me think im summin im not, i hate lying.i`d rather hear that i have pretty potenshall(spelling haha) then o yeah you are pretty, when behind my back you  are like i wanna attack her and shes so gross. tho i lie to myself and have lied before. right here right now im stopping. people want the truth they are gunna get it anyway.i have deleted the comment and made the entry friends only.i think the whole journal might be friends only, i really love to get out my thoguhts and i have a horrible say with speaking how i feel and i think i write it better, with these type of issues that are close to my heart it`s gunna be a friends only entry. how can i be confident when people point out all the wrong things!! people needa fucking realize that this is semi public and if they had summin like that comment to say , they shouldnt have posted it like that. i mean i know writing a journal like this is making my life public but i shouldnt read it if you dont care about me.

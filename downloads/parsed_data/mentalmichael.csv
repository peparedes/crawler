It took me 15 months (including my final year at uni when I was applying), 6 months of work experience at seven agencies, and God knows how many hours spent writing applications and attending grad scheme interviews, and I end up being offered a job after a twenty minute chat. Someone up there has a sense of humour.

I start at a major London advertising agency on a global account on Monday (which means I need to find a flat immediately). I'm still slightly stunned, as I walked out of the interview thinking ""that was fun, but it's never going to happen"". I was expecting to have to prepare for two grad schemes this weekend, instead I've been bouncing around the net looking for flats.

Wow."

Just a few of the names in it: Martin Sheen (President Bartlet!) Yvonne Strahovski, Adam Baldwin, Seth Green, Tricia Helfer, Carrie Ann Moss Michael Hogan (Col. Tigh!)

I have no idea how much it cost, but it was totally worth it, just for the fun of being ordered around by President Bartlet.

If you've never tried it before, give it a go. It's a slightly strange, but utterly brilliant show that came far too close to being cancelled, so please watch!

Corporations and settlers flooded through to explore and colonise the area.<br /><br />20 years later, the wormhole from Earth collapsed without explanation. In the sudden power vacuum, alliances formed and fractured. Thousands died in vicious conflicts, until the few remaining factions negotiated a cease-fire. Today, just two years after the end of the war, the sector is slowly rebuilding. Three main groups have emerged to control much of the sector: <br /><br />The Terran Alliance, made up of remnants of the Earth Navy and based on Terra Prime, the largest colony in the sector, <br /><br />The Pegasus Corporation, a new conglomerate formed when several companies agreed to pool their resources (and weapons), <br /><br />The Federation of Free Systems, a nebulous group of smaller players who clubbed together to resist being conquered. <br /><br />The peace is tenuous and frail, but has brought new opportunities for those willing to operate in the wild space between borders.&nbsp;In this new territory, a former mining facility has become a haven for traders, pirates and smugglers alike. Thanks to its position and popularity, the once abandoned Echo Station has become a home to representatives of all three factions, jockeying for influence. <br /><br />New to the station are the Phoenix and her crew, &ldquo;independent contractors&rdquo; who find themselves drawn into the webs of intrigue and conspiracy that fill the station. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Cast list and pics under the cut""><br /><div style=""text-align: center; ""><strong>Crew of the Phoenix</strong></div><img alt="""" src=""http://content6.flixster.com/photo/73/52/32/7352320_tml.jpg"" /><br />Kavan Smith &ndash; Captain Marcus Jones<br />His seemingly relaxed face hides an incredibly sharp mind.

It sucks, but in the current market just making it to the final round is actually an achievement (albeit a very frustrating one). I actually got told by one of them that I was one of the last ones ruled out, but I didn't convey enough ""excitability"" - apparently I come across as too analytical (though one person said I had ""gravitas"" which I find funny as hell!)

At the moment I'm kinda stuck in limbo - some agencies will be launching schemes in the New Year, and I've signed up to a couple of specialist recruitment agencies who seem quite impressed with my CV, but until January nothing's likely to happen. It's frustrating as hell, but it's clear that the entire industry is suffering, and the agencies that are running schemes are massively over subscribed - one place had 2000 applicants for 6 places.

In other news, I'm off to see Avatar with some friends this afternoon. It's in 2D, as I don't want to drive through ice and snow to Milton Keynes to see it in 3D - if I like it, might go back next year and see it in 3D. 

Also, Chuck is airing again in January! For such a great show, there really isn't enough good fanfic, so it'll be nice to get some new episodes.

Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to all."

<lj-cut>
It wasn't great- the post sex scene was pretty painful, and I'm annoyed that Chloe + Scott are sleeping together *already*, but Eli's reaction made up for it (I swear, I'm not shipping anyone in this show, but if I was, it would be Eli + Chloe - cliched, but cute).

The effects were brilliant - shots of the sun from the observation deck were stunning.

The plot was incredibly predictable, to the point that my dad guessed how it would go from the end of the previous episode, but it was nicely done, and deliberately paced without being too slow. The ending, with the last minute shuttle catch, was well done too.

I didn't really like the ending with Rush + Young - it didn't make sense that he knew what would happen, as they still sent the shuttle off with all the supplies - it was trying to make him mysterious, and failed.

Still, it's getting better episode to episode - this could turn into a good show

"event","So, I saw the first two eps. My thoughts, with limited spoilers, under the cut.
<lj-cut>
It's not bad. I wasn't blown away by it, certainly not as much as Atlantis (there wasn't a moment to match the rising of the city), but probably better than SG-1's pilot. The plot worked as a set-up, and some of the characters are quite good - Lt Scott, and Dr Rush in particular. Effects wise, the opening battle was fine, and the ship looks pretty cool. Seeing it in HD helped. Some characters were seriously under-used - you wouldn't know that the IOA lady was a main character.

My big problem is the writing. One scene, between Chloe and Lt Scott, was actually painful to watch. The rest of it seemed to be reaching towards BSG, and not quite getting there. I seem to recall reading that they were bringing in new writers - hopefully this'll result in it improving.

Overall, a decent start to what could (and I'm really, really stressing *could*) be a really good show. As it stands, I'm not convinced.

</lj-cut>

I watched the show with my mum. She watched SG-1, and started to watch Atlantis, but basically stopped post season 3 (wise, wise choice). She asked me how Atlantis ended. I'm amazed by how angry I can still get at that episode!"

Thankfully my stomach has been fine so far as otherwise this might go very badly - as it is we're stocked up with crisps, biscuits and bananas, and there's a bar on board so if all else fails we can drink ourselves into oblivion! 

Met the group we'll (I'm here with one of my best friends, Adam) be travelling south with last night - I'm impressed by the Australian couple in their early fifties - pretty adventurous given that this is a very basic holiday. There's also a german couple in their mid twenties - haven't tried speaking to them in German yet. I was surprised, and a bit disappointed, that there aren't more people our age, but we'll deal - probably go off and do our own stuff in the day and meet up in the evening + for transport - they all seem nice, which is the most important thing I guess.

Bangkok is.... somewhat overwhelming, to be honest. It's very hot and humid - about the same as Hong Kong, manically busy, noisy, smelly... you name it. Khao San road is the main tourist street, and it's packed - hate to think what this is like in the high season. We've seen an incredible amount of stuff in just three days - Golden Mount, iron monastery, Wat Pho, the palace, the national museum Jim Thompson's house, the city aquarium, and so on. It was the Queen's birthday on Wednesday night, which was amazing - they sealed off a large chunk of the city to traffic and put up stages with music and dancing, thai boxing (very brutal - makes British boxers look like wimps), snake charming, and hundreds of vendors. It was good to see something real, outside the tourist bubble. That was the only place we really got stared at - most people you meet are friendly (and trying to sell you something). It's been interesting, but I'm glad to be moving on.

Not to mention the weirdness of the red matter (that was clearly taken from the set of alias) that can both open up a black hole *and* some kind of space-time rift that ships can safely travel through.

I was so skeptical about the angels idea, but it's really paid off - it's not the same show it was back in the early seasons, but I think it's gotten better. The one-offs are as good as they ever were (a depressed, suicidal teddy bear, anyone?), but the overarching plot is much more gripping than last season's. 

The latest two-parter is an example of how good the show can get. The final scene, where Dean tells Sam what happened to him in Hell - that's probably the most powerful scene in the series so far. Makes me wonder if that was what happened to John Winchester, and how long he lasted. I hope that Anna comes back later on, as she was a great character - I kinda liked the idea of Sam, Dean, a demon and an angel!

Lastly, Alistair must die. I hate that guy a hell of a lot more than Lillith, and about the same as I hated old yellow-eyes.
</lj-cut>

The ratings for this season have been good, so hopefully it'll be renewed - it would be a shame to cut this storyline short. Can't wait to see where it goes from here."

"event","Man, I really do suck at updating this thing. For those of you who were worried (you were worried, right?), I'm still alive, and still at Bristol. University's going fairly well, although it's kinda scary that I have 6 essays to go and then I'm going to graduate. That said, I haven't exactly had the best university career, and I do know what I want to do after I graduate - I may be the only person in my year who's actually looking forward to leaving university! I'm filling out applications for grad schemes at the moment, and it's hard - I've already had two rejections, but all you can do is just keep trying and hoping.

And now, a brief summary of what I'm watching and my thoughts:
Atlantis - We've had some good episodes this season, but it's never going to be what it could have been. Hopefully the writers will learn some lessons from it and apply them to Universe - even though I am still very dubious about that one. I read somewhere that Kavan Smith was hoping to jump ship to Universe, to which I can only say ""Hell yes"". If he could take David Nikyl as well that would be great.

Burn Notice - Does anyone else watch this? It's a great show, which suffers a bit with a 'problem of the week' approach, but the actors make it work. Also has some great guest stars - Richard Schiff, Tricia Helfer, and Michael Shanks (not all in the same episode, sadly).

Supernatural - I was skeptical about the whole ""angels"" plotline, but it's actually worked really well. The overarching storyline is far more interesting this season than the whole ""Dean's going to hell"", and some of the one-off episodes have been wonderful. Everyone should watch Wishful Thinking, for the best supernatural manifestation ever.

House - love this. Only on season 3, and I'm confused by all the House/Cuddy stuff that's starting to come in (and apparently gets more prominent in later seasons), but it's still great. 

Heroes - *sigh*. This was such a good show in the first season, but now it's starting to annoy me. They constantly contradict what happened in earlier seasons, which for a guy like me (who remembers every little detail of television shows) is just plain aggravating. Still entertaining, but I don't care about this anymore.

The Wire - Watch this show. Seriously, everyone go and watch this show right now. This isn't television, it's art. Buy it, watch it, and start talking about it. It's initially hard to watch, but once you get into it, it's incredible."

Between evening sessions in London with the other people on the course + traveling home / to see friends at the weekends I'm averaging two full evenings in Bristol a week - it's crazy, I'm exhausted, and I'm having a fantastic time! The downside is that I still don't have the net in my house, and though they're pretty relaxed about surfing at work I'm not all that keen to explain the whole fandom thing so I've basically been out of touch with everything for the last few weeks. Having seen the stuff about the next ep of Atlantis that may not be such a bad thing.

Also - Dark Knight was awesome, but personally I'd rate Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart + Christian Bale as being as good as Ledger.

Saw Die Hard 4 - nothing like the originals but still damn entertaining (perhaps Lucas + Spielberg should have watched it before embarking on the travesty that was Kingdom of the Cristal Skull!)

Lastly, everyone go buy The Wire. Right now. Seriously, it's probably the second best show I've ever seen (after West Wing), and I say that having only seen the first season."

It's official - my journey to the dark side has begun. Shoot me now.

(By the way, the story was ""After the End"", containing both Hermione/Ron and Harry/Ginny, with spoilers only up to the end of the fourth book yet set in an AU after the defeat of Voldemort. It can be found here: http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=619&chapno=1)

In other fandom news, I've discovered that gen Atlantis fic can actually be good, as demonstrated by ""The Therapeutic Properties of Coffee"" http://liketheriverrun.livejournal.com/11390.html . There is Katy/Rodney ship, but it's a background to the friendship between John + Rodney.

The best story I've read in ages can be found here: http://www.kekkai.org/synecdochic/sga/freedoms_just_another_word.html

It's set after the expedition has returned to Earth, and looks at Rodney settling into life on Earth. There is some slash, but it's never described in any detail whatsoever apart from that a relationship existed and the relationship has ended by the time of the story. I never go near slash but the writing on this one is too good to pass up.

Enjoy, hopefully. Don't blame me if you end up wasting a lot of time in the near future."

<lj-cut>
I've been back in Bristol for a week now and if things don't get better in the next few weeks I honestly don't think I'm going to last until Christmas, let alone until the end of the year. Firstly, second-year life is *hard* - cooking, cleaning, dealing with stupid stuff like the trash collection and sorting out the internet in the flat. On top of that, I'm living with two guys who are nice but I have nothing in common with, and I'm spending a good 70% of my time on my own. I've completely lost my appetite to the point where I actively feel nauseous when I eat my breakfast, and I've been ringing home about every other day. Several of these conversations have ended with me in tears (and I never cry - not even at funerals). I'm trying to make an effort and visit friends + join societies, but it's been fresher's week so I haven't had much work + no societies have been running. Most of my friends are in two big houses, and I just don't feel that I can pop round whenever I feel like it, even though they are being very welcoming. Going out with them is fun, but the moment always comes when I have to go back to the flat alone. Every morning I'm waking up very early and all I want is to jump on a train and go home.

My parents have said that I can come home next weekend, but I just don't think that that will help - I just have to gut it out. That said, if things haven't improved in three weeks then I'm definately going to go home for the weekend..

"event","Haven't posted for a while, so here's what I've been up to. <lj-cut>

Well, I spent most of the last 8 weeks working for a salvage company, arranging to collect vehicles that have been damaged too badly to repair. This has taught me that all cheap insurance companies are evil, and should be avoided like the plague - the number of times I spoke to someone who couldn't understand why we'd been instructed to collect the vehicle.... well, it was eye-opening, to say the least. Still, it was easy enough work + the pay was good (for a student). I might go back there next year, if I have nothing better to do / need the money again.

In two weeks I head back to Bristol - I have mixed feelings over that one - I'm not living with my friends, but rather with two guys who I get on fine with but am not that close with - the whole saga of accomodation occupied most of the Easter term last year, and means that I'm honestly not sure I'm going to see the people who were my good friends. After spending time with my school friends it's kinda scary to think of going back there and potentially starting all over again. Even worse, my essays + exams actually matter this year! On the other hand, I think I will probably still see my friends from the hall, albeit not as much as I would like, and I'm looking foward to seeing my other friends, the ones who weren't involved in the whole housing debacle. Even better, one of my best friends from home is starting at Bristol this year, and having her around is enough to make up for all the other issues.

So that's that - it was a quiet but enjoyable summer, with some brilliant moments (Reading Festival was a highlight - to see one of the best bits from that look at this: <lj-embed id=""1"" /> 

Standing there watching that with my friends was just incredible.

p.s. Anyone who is even remotely interested in gaming has got to buy Bioshock - it's more mature, intelligent and thought-provoking than the average show or movie, and has one of the greatest twists EVER. Also, the voice acting makes most tv shows pale in comparison. And The West Wing is still amazing, as is Dexter - an unusual show well worth checking out, and not just because the lead actor has the same name as me (seriously, he even has the same middle initial!)

It only lost it in one scene with a helicopter which turned into a horror-comedy moment, but other than that it held together really well. Whoever did the special effects deserves an award. I should warn you, a couple of my friends came out pretty traumatised.

It's called ""The Most Hated Family in America"" and was about a Christian Church / family who picket military funerals in the US. They believe that the soldiers are dying as a punishment from God for America tolerating gay people. That such a level of ignorance and intolerance can still exist is quite frankly terrifying. The worst thing was watching a nine year old boy holding a sign with the words ""Fag Soldiers"" on it. He clearly had no real understanding of why they were there or what it all meant. To see something like that truly challenges my belief in free speech. These people are free to believe what they want, and to tell people their beliefs, but picketing a dead soldier's funeral.... that's a terrible and difficult thing to allow. I strongly urge anyone and everyone to watch this show if they get the chance.

"event","Well, I just watched it - my thoughts, with spoilers, under the cut
<lj-cut>
It seems like this is another marmite ep - and I loved it. Dominion gave us the lead into the films, this served more as a tribute to the show and to the fans. I liked but wasn't surprised by the Daniel/Vala stuff - that was clearly the way the show's been going (although I really liked the bit where Daniel just snapped and started to vent - it's good to show that side of him. I did think that having Landry there was a bit strange, but it worked okay. A lot of people seem to be raging against the death of the Asgard, but we've known that their race was dying for about 5 series now, so it didn't bother me, and I liked their sacrificing themselves for their friends. I'm a little surprised by the way that Asgard tech now seems superior to Ori tech (contrast that with their performance in Camelot), but I'll overlook it. Not having Jack there was.... difficult. I would have loved to finally see a proper relationship between Jack and Sam, but ultimately I think that Richard Dean Anderson left the show after the eighth season, so it arguably wouldn't have been fair to have him waltzing back in when the show wants us to say goodbye to the current cast members.

 The most moving parts for me were the moment when Thor tells them that they are ""The Fifth Race"", concluding a process that began all the way back in season 2, as well the series of shots interwoven with the cello. The final scene itself was a celebration of the essence of the show - the group ""indeed"" and Landry's ""Godspeed"" had me bouncing in my seat (yes, seriously, I bounced), and the final shot..... well, it couldn't have been better.

Although I'm still frustrated by the forced curtailment of the Ori storyline (I'm still not convinced by the idea of TV films), this was undeniably a fitting end to the show, if not the story. More than that, it summed up why stargate has lasted ten years. Many, including myself, think that Galactica is a superior show. It has tenser storylines, more flawed characters, and less of a reliance on deus ex endings. But if you gave me a choice between the two shows, I'd still choose Stargate. It offers a world of wisecracking heroes and malevolent villains, where you can always believe that good will triumph over evil. It may not be as ""realistic"" as Galactica, but it's a world that I would like to be a part of - and isn't that the whole point?

Bring on the new spin-off, and good luck to all the cast and crew. It's been one hell of a ride.

You can go back in time and erase from the fabric of TV history THREE individual episodes of any TV show you want! The rest of the series(es) will not be altered. What do you choose?

1. It would be Irresistable, but Lucius would survive in Irresponsible, so I'm going to have to go with The Tower *shudder*

2. A third series ep of Buffy called ""Amends""

3. The O.C. third season finale ""The Graduates"". It would almost have been a good way to finish the show, until the last 2 minutes which were just stupid. I get why they did it, but I just couldn't be bothered to watch the fourth season after that.

You can go back in time and revive ONE unfairly cancelled television show and return it to the annals of TV history!* *CHOOSE WISELY, because if you attempt to revive more than one show, the wish will backfire and you'll instead be treated to a whole bunch of crappy made-for-TV ""reunion"" movies full of replacement actors.

I would say The West Wing, but it ended at a logical point so instead I'm saying Angel - it just got better and better towards the end. Joss Whedon did his best to tie everything up, but you could see that the plotlines could have easily gone for another year. That said, the finale was genius

To balance out the historical TV viewing schedule, you now have the power to retroactively CANCEL, at any point during the series, any one show! Alternately, you can wield your destructive might and DELETE one whole entire series from ever having been made. 

Big Brother. Enough said.

LIFE AND DEATH! You can now bring ONE character back from the dead... and, to restore the balance, you must also kill off a character! They don't have to be from the same fandom. 

Fred. If you know who that is, you know why.

Kill someone off? Claire from Lost. In the first series I hated her, Boone and Shannon. 

Bonus tradeoff: you can delete a single scene, relationship pairing or plot arc from any series that gave you hives... AND you can plug in any one [scene, pairing, plot arc] that you never got to see!

Sheyla.

Fred/Wesley. Two series of hoping, and then to have that happen?!?!?!?!?

2 hours later a friend of hers asks her to go for a drive ...she goes..... her friend swerved to avoid a truck....hitting a tree instead her friend was killed instantly....shes in critical condition This is the conversation between her sister and her boyfriend
Sister: omg ( crying )
Boy: what? whats wrong ?
Sister: my sister...your gf was involved in a major car wreck
Boy: is she ok ??????
Sister: shes in critical condition
Boy: i'll be there in 10 minutes
He shows up to the hospital room ...standing outside the door going over the last conversation in his mind over and over as he heard the machines beep and beep and breathing tubes pump
Boy: she wanted to give me something or tell me something
Girls mom: yeah this...
it was an envelope smelling like she did sealed with a kiss in lipstick he opened it..... it said ..... your everything to me....i love you with everything i am and everything i have...i want to spend the rest of my life with you sealed in it was a ripped movie ticket from the first movie they went to and the first picture they took together he kissed the picture as a tear fell from his face onto the picture it looked as if in the picture she was crying then the machines flatlined....3 minutes later she was pronounced dead.

If you have any heart...any soul...or want to be happy you will repost this. if you care for someone ...do not let something like this ever happen Post this in the next 200 seconds and you WILL have THE best day of your life THIS SATURDAY. You're number one *love* Will either kiss you, ask you out, or call you or better. If you break this chain you will have a lousy day on Saturday, and you know you can.

"event","everything just clicked into place.  i realized shit i never thought i would realize before, which is good because the biggest truth is Love Is Blind.  im not fucking kidding.  i wish my friends would see that especially bryan.  that reminds me now you like brittany wtf bro.  WHY DO PEOPLE FUCKING DO THIS?  DO YOU WANNA FUCKING DIE?  DAMN i know i did it twice ppl to two of my best friends but i am sorry for that shit.  i really am.  im gonna miss you bro.  good times, good fucking times.  too bad it might all go down the fuckin drain over one stupid girl...  i hate to see shit end this way.  this summer is pretty cool.  i never thought i would be hangin with nick again.  i dunno whatever happened to our friendship but it is pretty cool that we hangin out again.  some advice for all you whipped mother fuckers- like i said love is blind.  dont hide anything from any woman and if she don't like it TOO MOTHER FUCKIN BAD dont change for no one cuz you will regret it in the end.  only change you for you.  i guess robert is coming back saturday for one day which is gonna be cool cuz i've been clean for a month.  and that's about to change.  DAMN THIS FUCKING MOUNTAIN DEW IS GOOD.  i am so fucking glad i bought it when i was on the phone (i didn't mean to buy it) i was way too fuckin involved in the conversation.  ant it all fine and fucking dandy when a ex gf desperately tries to date all your friends?  no its fucking not.  especially since your friends (most of them actually) will pick your ex gf over u in a fucking heart beat.  which is really sad.  i can name a few ppl tho that would stick in there and be true friends tho.  i have to say nick is one of them but that's prolley just cuz hes after someone else.  how come no one follows the saying... bros before hoes.

btw can anyone tell me how to add pictures?  god damn.  fuck."

"event","wat up bitches.  yeah i know the music sux ass but it is my mood right now, lick my nuts.  when you just broke up with someone u love who isn't gonna have this song stuck in their head?!  i thought so.  this thing was a pain in the ass to make but hopefully it will be worth it.  i don't really know why i made it because i am probably moving around july 7-14 but who knows.  maybe we won't sell the house.  if we don't we are totally fucked.  we will have to make 2 house payments.  anyway life is pretty cool now.  been depressed alot this year over one girl which was a big mistake i won't make again.  yeah i still care about her but i'm trying to get it thru to myself that women are not worth getting sad over...or losing friends over.  most people i know would ditch their friends just for a piece of ass, then come crawling back when they get dumped.  it sux but it is really the truth.  oh well.  i was gonna leave a few shoutouts in my aim pro to all the ppl i wanna say bye to but didn't get the chance, but i don't wanna get all emo on everyone.  maybe just a few haha.  i know you all gonna miss me neways :-D  but i am gonna leave one special shoutout for a person and u know who u are.  this summer has been pretty cool so far but i wanna hang out with the ppl i used to instead of bein wasted all summer.  well maybe i will still be wasted but it will be good times with old friends.  one of my best bros ""went on the road"" for the summer and i guess i will just hang around wit whoever wants to hang out this summer.  damn this is a big ass fuckin paragraph.

i think i still love her."

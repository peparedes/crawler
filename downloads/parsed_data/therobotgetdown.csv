"event","work has been killing me lately..i go in at 8 in the morning and usually dont get out till 8-830 at night..and we have been working 7 days a week to keep up with the work load...i think this is going to be my last week working with this company..i cant handle the stress anymore.

i really want an office job.with a cubicle that i can decorate.

surprisingly ive been happy being single...ive been talking to brooke boston for sometime now but she is going to be gone for all of july and is then moving to georgia in september...so i dont really see that going any where....i think the only thing that keeps me from getting lonely is sebastian...she is the love of my life."

then we went and looked at the new acura TL S series...he has been shopping around for a new car for a while now and he has finally set his mind on the TL.  after that we went back to his house and i watched the format on carson daly for the millionth time.

my ex txt messaged me and started talking to me...and it made me think about a lot of things..but the more i thought about it i realized that janna is an amazing gf and i would be taking a step backwards if i went back out with my ex.

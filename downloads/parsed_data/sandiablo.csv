"event","The Military Man 
The average age of the military man is 19 years. He is a short haired, tight-muscled kid who, under normal circumstances is considered by society as half man, half boy. Not yet dry behind the ears, not old enough to buy a beer, but old enough to die for his country. He never really cared much for work and he would rather wax his own car than wash his father's; but he has never collected unemployment either. 




He's a recent High School graduate;  

he was probably an average student, 
pursued some form of sport activities, drives a ten year old jalopy,  

and has a steady girlfriend  

that either broke up with him when he left,  

or swears to be waiting when he returns from half a world away.  

He listens to rock and roll or hip-hop or rap or jazz or swing and 155mm howitzer.  

He is 10 or 15 pounds lighter now  

than when he was at home  

because he is working or fighting  

from before dawn to well after dusk. 

He has trouble spelling,  

thus letter writing is a pain for him,  

but he can field strip a rifle in 30 seconds  

and reassemble it in less time in the dark.  

He can recite to you the nomenclature  

of a machine gun or grenade launcher  

and use either one effectively if he must. 

He digs foxholes and latrines  

and can apply first aid like a professional.  

He can march until he is told to stop  

or stop until he is told to march. 



He obeys orders instantly and without hesitation,  

but he is not without spirit or individual dignity.  He is self-sufficient.  

He has two sets of fatigues:  

he washes one and wears the other.  

He keeps his canteens full and his feet dry. 

He sometimes forgets to brush his teeth,  

but never to clean his rifle. 

He can cook his own meals,  

mend his own clothes, and fix his own hurts. 

If you're thirsty, he'll share his water with you; if you are hungry, his food.  

He'll even split his ammunition with you  

in the midst of battle when you run low. 

He has learned to use his hands like weapons  

and weapons like they were his hands.  

He can save your life - or take it,  

because that is his job.  

He will often do twice the work of a civilian,  

draw half the pay  

and still find ironic humor in it all.  

He has seen more suffering 
and death then he should have  

in his short lifetime. 



He has stood atop mountains of dead bodies,  

and helped to create them. 
He has wept in public and in private,  

for friends who have fallen in combat 
and is unashamed. 

He feels every note of the National Anthem vibrate through his body 

while at rigid attention,  

while tempering the burning desire to 

'square-away' those around him  

who haven't bothered to stand, 
remove their hat, or even stop talking.  

In an odd twist, day in and day out, 
far from home, 

he defends their right to be disrespectful. 

Just as did his Father, Grandfather,  

and Great-grandfather,  

he is paying the price for our freedom.  Beardless or not, he is not a boy. 

He is the American Fighting Man  

that has kept this country free  

for over 200 years. 



He has asked nothing in return,  

except our friendship and understanding. 
Remember him, always,  

for he has earned our respect  

and admiration with his blood.  

And now we even have woman over there in danger, 
doing their part in this tradition 

of going to War  

when our nation calls us to do so.  

As you go to bed tonight,  

remember this shot..  

A short lull, a little shade  

and a picture of loved ones in their helmets 




 Prayer wheel for our military... please don't break it. Please send this on after a short prayer. 

Prayer Wheel 

""Lord, hold our troops in your loving hands. Protect them as they protect us.  
Bless them and their families  

for the selfless acts they perform for us  

in our time of need. Amen.""  

Prayer :  

When you receive this,  

please stop for a moment and say a prayer 
for our ground troops in Afghanistan, sailors on ships, and airmen in the air, 
and for those in Iraq.  

There is nothing attached....  

This can be very powerful....... 

Of all the gifts you could give a US Soldier, Sailor, Coastguardsman, Marine 
or Airman, prayer is the very best one. 
I can't break this one, sorry 
This is a ribbon for soldiers fighting in Iraq.  Pass it on to everyone and pray."

i have moved into Stacy's house(again) but his time we arent sharing a bed, or even a room....im living with Zander...we have our own beds...lol....i hear him a little when he wakes up in the morning but ive been able to fall right back asleep so no biggie.....

i have 2 jobs, though im thinking about quiting one cause the hours are getting cut back and the check isnt worth giving up a night off....but work is good...im losing weight from walking so much...i wanna get a pedometer so i can see how many miles a day i walk around the mall....ggrrrr...o well at least its helping me lose weight....

my mom is harping on me to pay her back for the laptop she bought me for school, the one im using right now...cause i had to drop out of school to work more so i could afford to pay her rent(this happened before she decided to kick me out)...so yeah thats fun....

and i have been trying to find a place to live....i am staying at stacys only until i can find a place to live...i cannot live here forever, nor would i want too...i want a place of my own with no parents around....plus if stacys leaves this house it would be wierd to be here without her, you know....

Zander finally said my nae today without being provoked....usually we have to ask him to say my name but today he said it...of course he didnt say crystal (c's are hard for kids) but my name is ""tutu""...i love it...i always knew id end up with a nickname and i love mine....i am aunt tutu...i love him so much....its ok that i have to share a room with my boyfriend, hes a cutie and he has the cutest little snore...only he can get away with snoring and not have me want to strangle him...

i miss my friends that are in the service...Sterling and Juan the most...i wish they were closer....i talk to them on the phone but its not the same as hanging out.....i hope that changes soon
i have no man, no boyfriend, the guy i was talking to barely talks to me anymore....we are trying to still be friends but i dont know what he wants anymore.....

"event","THE FINAL INSPECTION 

This is a poem Dedicated to the Marines that have given their life for our country

The Marine stood and faced God
Which must always come to pass
He hoped his shoes were shining
Just as brightly as his brass.
'Step forward now, you Marine,
How shall I deal with you?
Have you always turned the other cheek?
To My Church have you been true?'
The Marine squared his shoulders and
said, 'No, Lord, I guess I ain't
Because those of us who carry guns
Can't always be a saint.
I've had to work most Sundays
And at times my talk was tough,
And sometimes I've been violent,
Because the world is awfully rough.
But, I never took a penny
That wasn't mine to keep...
Though I worked a lot of overtime
When the bills got just too steep, 
And I never passed a cry for help,
Though at times I shook with fear,
And sometimes, God forgive me,
I've wept unmanly tears.
I know I don't deserve a place
Among the people here,
They never wanted me around
Except to calm their fears.
If you've a place for me here, Lord,
It needn't be so grand,
I never expected or had too much,
But if you don't, I'll understand.'
There was a silence all around the throne
Where the saints had often trod
As the Marine waited quietly,
For the judgment of his God,
'Step forward now, you Marine,
You've borne your burdens well,
Walk peacefully on Heaven's streets,
You've done your time in Hell.'

"event","well i have had a great weekend...my friend Chris came up from LA thursday night so that he could spend my birthday with me...Friday we just hung out until it was time to go to another friends house to watch a bunch of movies (my choice for how i wanted to spend my birthday) we watched 4 movies before i was to tired to see anymore...so Chris and i came back to my house and had dinner at 2am...and then saturday morning he left to back to LA becauce he had to work and i hung out with my family...we had dinner (tacos, my choice) for my birthday, it was just supposed to be family but my stepdad invited our neighbors too and it got really loud at my house...it was ok, not the dinner i was hoping for but it was good and i had fun, until i had to goto work anyways....today was uneventful which is better than bad and tomorrow im celebrating one more time by going to the bar with friends to drink my way into my 24th year....i wish Chris was going to be there but he cant, living in LA and all....i definitely enjoy spending time with him, i wish it could be more but i dont take the time i do have with him for granted and thats better than seeing him too much...i would rather appreciate what i have than have everything i want....
one of the best birthdays ever...also on the top of the list is 21(cause thats the one you look forward too, and i got to celebrate it for like 2 whole weeks cause i have a lot of friends that turned 21 at the same time) and 22 was good too(sterling bought me flowers and stacy got me a cake, and i found out i was going to be a godmother) ....anyways... i hope i have more birthdays like this one...

other new news, i dropped all my classes, too much stress to deal with right now....i finally have a permanent position at the mall doing security and im looking for a place to live outside of my parents house....they are driving me batty....ok enough for now...bedtime calls..."

i fell into a real depression right after my break down at work and i finally got out of it this past weekend...medical help is definitely a good idea....
i feel much better now, with the exception of today.....
now i just have to worry about work....because my hours havent been approved yet im not working full time yet and i need to make more money...so im job hunting tomorrow if i feel better.....and i think im going to stop going to school this semester and wait until next semester when i have the work situation figured out...its just too stressful to worry about school and homework and time to do homework on top of what i already have to deal with with work and life....
i need to move out of this house...it is getting worse, i am getting worse staying here....i would do anything and live with just about anyone right now if it means i can get out of here and the chance to reclaim my sanity...so im hopeful i can find a place to live or someone to live with soon, or soon enough....

i have ben thinking about all the things tat are causing stress in my life and its remarkable that i lasted this long without breaking down over it all....im not going to get into it now cause i think i need a nap before i go to work tonight...so im going to go rest and be lazy for a couple hours....."

"event","for a couple reasons.....Lydia is going back to Chicago this weekend and i just said goodbye to her cause i work so much the next couple days that i wont get to see her before she leaves....im going to miss her....she was a great sourse of strength and sanity this summer....my wife has that effect on me...our 15 kids miss her too....she has our favorite with her, his name is ""Bob dole like the orange juice but not from Concentrate""....LOL.....we will keep in touch but its never the same as having her here........
im also sad i really miss Chris....i can see things in me and read me better than anyone ever has....he calls me on my bullshit and makes it so comfortable for me to be completely honest with him.....he also makes me laugh, a lot, when i was there(with the exception of the mini cry fest one night) i was always smiling and laughing....it was amazing....i feel comfortable with him in ever sense of the word....which you think would have been harder to attain concidering we knew each other for like a week and had hung out together like 10 hours total prior to my visit to stay at his house for 3 days...i mean usually theres the awkward period of being in a new place and around new people and not knowing what to do and i never had that....from the minute i walked through the door he made me feel welcome and at home with him in his house....i know a few of you know who im talking about and i may sound rediculous and you may be thinking ive lost my mind and i would have to agree 100%.....ive lost it and am not willing to give up until i find it and get it back....read into that what you will....i have never met anyone like him, hes such a sweetheart....so curtious and kind, funny and simple, hes a total gentleman(opening doors and making dinner/breakfast and always making sure i had what i needed) i didnt think men like him existed before he came along.....and, now dont take this the wrong way, but sometimes i wish i had never met him...because if i had never met him i wouldnt know he existed, i wouldnt miss his smile and kind words, i wouldnt know someone could make me so happy so easily....but at the same time im so glad that i got to meet him, that he came into my life and reminded what was out there, he woke up a part of me that had been asleep for quite a while....he is a great friend and has already given me great advise and taught me valuable lessons in the short time we have been friends....he is so respectful of me and what i want and so careful with my feelings im still kinda in awe that he exists and that i know him......
ok enough ramblings from the crazy girl...but reflecting just now brought a smile to my face so im a little cheered up.....hes teaching me about different kinds of music....like metal and indie groups that ive never heard of....im learning a lot about him and expanding my music selection at the same time...plus im just thrilled that someone is taking the time to teach me something that they care so much about....i could listen for hours to someone talking about something that they are passionate about....anyways
time to get ready for work so ill write more laters

"event","The first day of school our professor introduced  himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know. I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder.

I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. 




! She said, ""Hi handsome. My name is Rose.

I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?""

I laughed and enthusiastically responded, ""Of course you may!"" and she gave me a giant squeeze.

""Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?"" I asked.




She jokingly replied, ""I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, and have a couple of kids...""

""No seriously,"" I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age.

""I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!"" she told me.

After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake.

We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this ""time machine"" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me.

Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went.

She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up.

At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet.

I'll never forget what she taught us. She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor.

Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said, ""I'm sorry I'm so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this
whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.""

As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, ""We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing.

There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die.

We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it!

There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up.

If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty y ears old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight.

Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunity in change. Have no regrets.

The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with
regrets.""

She concluded her speech by courageously singing ""The Rose.""

She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives.

At the year's end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago.

One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep.

Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who  taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.

When you finish reading this, please send this peaceful word of advice to your friends and family, they'll really enjoy it!

These words have been passed along in loving memory of ROSE.

REMEMBER, GROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY. GROWING UP IS OPTIONAL.
We make a Living by what we get, We make a Life by what we give.

God promises a safe landing, not a calm passage. If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it.

Pass this message to 7 people except you and me. You will receive a miracle tomorrow

If you choose not, then you refuse to bless someone else.

"event","We have all by now heard about the woman that was protesting outside the president home in texas because of her son who was killed in Iraq.....here is the story you havent heard yet about how he was killed....


Army Specialist Casey Sheehan - Someone You Should (Have) Know(n)
Casey Sheehan grew up in a devout Catholic home.  He served as an altar boy and then as a key member of his church's youth group for years.

When he was old enough, Casey joined the Boy Scouts, becoming the very second Eagle Scout out of his troop.

He enlisted in the Army when he was twenty years old.  He decided to be a mechanic.  He would undergo Combat Lifesaver training - a class on how to give IVs and treat trauma only second in intense learning to combat medic training.  He was also certified to assist with giving communion to soldiers while in the field.

Specialist Sheehan re-enlisted in the Army in 2004 knowing full well that he could be sent into a combat zone.

Casey Sheehan was a Humvee mechanic with the 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment.

On April 3rd, 2004, forces loyal to Shi'ite cleric Muqtada al'Sadr stormed police stations and government offices in Sadr City (a city of over 2 million).  They knew the Americans would come, and they wanted a fight.  Muqtada Sadr was working them up into a religious frenzy.  And he had his thugs murder anyone who he thought might stand in his way - even other Shi'ite clerics.  His forces were known as the Mahdi Army.

American forces quickly surrounded Muqtada al'Sadr's quarters.

On April 4th, 2004, al'Sadr's Mahdi forces blocked roadways and bridges with burning tires, vehicles and trash.  Visibility was less than 300 meters anywhere in the city.  They began to attack American vehicles on patrol throughout Sadr City - some were protecting Shia worshipers (Holy Arbayeen) while others were escorting city government vehicles. 

A battle raged across Sadr City.  Insurgents assaulted American troops while looters and mobs formed and stormed through the streets.  Word spread quickly across the American FOBs that there was trouble.


Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment were ambushed with RPGs and pinned down and dying.  While fighting off an attack himself, the Commander of the 2/5th, LTC Volesky, called for help.  A Quick Reaction Force (QRF) was formed of volunteers - their mission was to go out and rescue the American troops.

Casey Sheehan's Sergeant asked for volunteers.  Sheehan had just returned from Mass.  After Sheehan volunteered once, the Sergeant asked Sheehan again if he wanted to go on the mission.  According to many reports (and according to his own mother), Casey responded, ""Where my Chief goes, I go.""

The QRF was launched.  Not long after entering the Mahdi area, the QRF was channeled onto a dead-end street where the roofs were lined with snipers, RPGs, and even some militia throwing burning tires onto the vehicles.  The Mahdi blocked the exit and let loose with everything they had.

Sheehan's vehicle was hit with multiple RPGs and automatic-weapons fire.

Specialist Casey Sheehan and Corporal Forest J. Jostes were killed.

A second QRF was formed - all volunteers - to go rescue the first.  Specialist Ahmed Cason was hit in the second QRF - but kept fighting until he bled to death.

Seven men died with Casey Sheehan on Sunday, April 4th, 2004.  

They were Spc. Robert R. Arsiaga, Spc. Ahmed Cason, Sgt. Yihjyh L. ""Eddie"" Chen, Spc. Stephen D. Hiller, Spc. Israel Garza, Cpl. Forest J. Jostes, and Sgt. Michael W. Mitchell.

It was Palm Sunday.

Palm Sunday commemorates the day that Jesus entered Jerusalem.  Back then, the palm frond was a symbol of victory - laid beneath the feet of those of the highest honor and triumph.  Some believe it was this honor fit for a king that forced Jesus's enemies to act and crucify him.

In recognition of Casey, the Catholic Chapel at Fort Hood, Texas (where Sheehan was stationed) named the Knights of Columbus chapter the ""Casey Austin Sheehan Council"".

Casey also received the Bronze Star for his Valor that day.

Palm fronds for the most honored."

well i got my first of 3 insurance checks this weekend that i get to put towards buying anew car....i found the car this car this weekend and i found out the price of it today(i test drove it before it was inventoried and priced) and so now tomorrow morning before work, and with one less hour of sleep, i get to go to the bank and ask them about my loan, because im changing the car and dollar amount of the loan i was already preapproved for...luckily the price is cheaper and the car is better(in my opinion) than the other one....im not going to say the car until i have it in my possession...no jinxes this time...and as soon as i have the car i will take to everyones houses so they can see and i will post what it is here for everyone else.....

i have been having a pretty rough time running the store while my boss is away only because of the people i am now in charge of...and its not so much my sister, the only trouble shes giving me is not knowing things because she's new....and the other girl is new also but apparently she lied and is only 15 years old and is finding it difficult to use her common sense and retain information about how we run this store....i may need a vacation when my boss returns...but other than that everythings ok...at work....i work both jobs today...when i get done closing the store tonight i will have about 45 minutes to get home, change clothes, pack some snacks, leavemy house, buy dinner, and head to work....and then when i get off at 3am ill have about 5 hours of sleep so that i can get to bank before work...YAY, not....but i need the money....

a long time ago i made a myspace account...i didnt fill in any info or anything but i logged on and yesterday when i checked my email and old friend(and ex boyfriend) had somehow known it was mine and started talking to me again(hes in the air force nd we talk sometimes when he comes home on leave) but i think its funny how much we have in common and that he found me online....not that we are going to get married or anything i was just surprised to hear from him thats all.......

i bought a new book today..angels and demons by dan brown(guy that wrote the da vinci code) and ill start reading it as soon as i finish the book im currently reading.....

im ready for school to start also....well as ready as i can be i guess...its been a long time since ive been in school and im a little nervous about going back, but im sure ill be ok and im looking forward to it....

no word yet on the new security job but we will see what happens with it in the next couple weeks.....

last night Lydia and i had a mini movie marathon...i had already seen all 3 movies we watched but she hadnt...we watched Saw, Cellular, and Man on Fire.....Man on Fire was definitely the best and luckily it was last too....we were up till like 230a so thats probably why im a little tired, and she had to wake up earlier than me to work in her backyard so shes probably tired too, unless she decided to sleep instead...i cant think of anything else right now.....imgoing to go back to my book and helping customers(hopefully only a few more today if any)....k bye"

o on friday night, movie night with the guys, we went bowling at rancho, it was so much fun, there was 9 of us, and all the 21 and overs decided to drunk bowl, luckily Fred was there and offered to drive me home so i could get drunk, so i did, not wasted but tipsy, it was fun....waking up early to get Fred to work on time sucked cause i had to work to but it was worth it to have a safe ride home the night before, Fred just ended up stuck at my house cause he had no ride home at that point, thanks Fred....

"event","i know its been awhile since my last update ive been real busy and tired lately.  my bed is not comfy so im not sleeping good which hurts my back which causes constant pain and makes me more tired.  anyways.  im getting my car replaced, my insurance is giving me 4000 for my car so thats good.  probably more than i could have gotten selling it.  i have found a new car that i want but i will need a small car loan to get it so im not saying anything about it yet, dont want to jinx it ya no.  ive bought half my books for my classes next semester(my other books arent in yet) and im hoping my financial aid will be approved and ill be re-imbursed but we will see about all that.  Lydia and i were supposed to be going to Magic Mountain but decided to postpone it till early september in hopes that we will get a bigger crowd to go with us and hopefully Sterling will come into town to accompany us also.  i have been reading like crazy lately, the newest Harry Potter in 2 days, The Da Vinci Code in 2 days, and a couple others.  Work is boring as always, all i do at the bear store is read and all i do at the security job is watch movies, and between buying new books and renting movies im poor, and thats just entertainment during work hours....Diablo is hiring for outage help again, which would help a lot, but since im going back to school i cant work it, unless i give up all extra time and and sleep during my work week, because i have thought of a way to make it work but i would be going straight from school to work and then straight from work to school, so probably wont but might, not like i have a life anyways.  I am on a mission now to find a church to attend, i need it, for multiple reasons one of which is i want to be baptized, but i cant just pick a church, but i dont know what else to do.  ill figure it out.  i havent seen or talked to Stacy much lately, Zander either, i miss you guys.  my sister Candace moved home a couple weeks ago because she is having a baby, probably in the next 3 weeks, she wants a planned c-section, this is her first child, shes 22 years old and no baby's daddy in picture, she doesnt want to experience labor so she opting out of it.  she is having a girl, or at least thats what she was told but a doctor, it could still come out a boy, but i think its a girl.  so now my mom has all her girls back at home, yay mom, and apparently the marriage homefront is getting a bit rocky, dont know what will happen(moms angry and sad) but it doenst sound good for their future.   anyways.  i cant think of anything else right now, ive lost some old friends and made some new, im just trying to change all the bad parts of my life out for good parts.  o, i quit smoking again, hopefully for good this time.  ok, well ill talk later..k bye"

"event","ok, so my day was eventful, a little too eventful for my taste but maybe it'll turn out for the best.  so i had to wake up early today, to take care of business before work, so i was feeling a little tired at 2p this afternoon when i was at work.  I was helping a customer end a sale when i heard what sounded like our store neighbors bropping something that broke(the coffee place people always brop things) but then i heard a horn going off, a car horn, that wouldnt stop.  So it takes a few minutes for my brain to process that what i heard was actually a car accident, and by the sound of the horn a very close one.  So i wrap up the sale real quick and run out side(i work at the mall, and the back entrance to my store is by when the entrance to Red Robin is) right as i walk out the back door i see a truck(what used to be a really new chevy avalanche) smashed into the building.  Then i look to see my car, and i think ""thats not where i parked my car"" and then, ""why dont i see my trunk"".  Yes, i parked my car today outside the back entrance where shop keepers load and unload supplies, etc..  im allowed to park there because of work but customers are not.  so i still havent found out what this lady was doing that put her anywhere near my car, because if she was aiming for the parking lot, she way missed.  Anyways.. so my car is parked, e-brake on, while im working.  this lady doing whatever she was doing when she hit my car, pushes my car 50 feet or so and the only reason my car stops and doesnt hit the building infront of her is because it hits a pillar, a solid concrete pillar.  so tiny wrapup real quick, lady in big truck hits right back side on my little car and pushes it 50 feet into a concrete pillar, at which point she was freed from my car(seeing as it could go no further) and proceeded to smash into the side of Robinsons may's loading area and take down some of it(concrete and brick).  Now im not a pro at this but you have to be going pretty damn fast to hit a car(which should slow you down) and then to hit a building and crumble it.  So i see my car and i see the lady staggering so i call 911 to make sure they have been called, they had, but whoever called said no medical help was needed, so i corrected her and asked for an ambulance for this lady that was obviously not ok.  at this time i call my boss and tell her that the cops are coming cause of this accident and ill need to be outside(away from the store) cause my car was involved, so she lets me close for about an hour to handle everything.  the rest of the story is pretty dull...lady wisked away in ambulance, dont know what she was doing or if she was intoxicated yet(hopefully will find out in police report) i dont even get any of her information until the report comes out because of the new privacy act (or so the cop told me) all i found out was that she does have insurance.  i get the report number so i can pick it up when its ready, i file a claim with my insurance, i get my car towed to fosters(at the other drivers expense of course) and my parents drop off one of the many other cars at our house for me to drive until we find out if they are going to total my car or fix it.  everyone that has seen my car thinks its totalled, which i think is kinda funny, im trying to sell my car and then it ends up in an accident that may have totalled it, im not injured because i wasnt there when it happened but i might still get a new car out of it(well a new used car).  so yeah.  the only people i contacted today were involved in the car process somehow, until after work, when i realized i was still running off adrenaline and went to Lydia's to sit in the hottub and relax.  now im real tired cause i feel like ive been on overdrive all day.  but im ok, ill be great, i will be even better once i find out whats happening with my car (which i do have pictures of, for posterity of course) and why the lady(who didnt speak english by the way) decided to give it a makeover.
k bye for now"

"event","I seriously hate the holidays this year.

First my asshole husband bitched and bitched about how he wanted to get a playstation 2 and that I should only get my (yes my, since he doesn't give a damn about her or wants to do anything with her) daughter one gift this year.  This is her first holiday and first holidays only come around once but he made the excuse that she wasn't a year old yet and wouldn't remember it.  Bullshit she won't remember, she is remember more and more everyday and she is going to know that we only got her one when everyone else got her lots!

Well then we had a bill come up unexpected so we could only get the one gift and all he could think about was that he wasn't getting his damn playstation 2!

How fucking childish and self centered!

Plus he likes to bitch about the neighbors waking her up at night but he doesn't do a god damn thing about it or help in anyway with her.  As a matter of fact last night she was woken up and he fucking went to bed leaving me to get her to sleep!

I am up with her at 8 am everyday and he doesn't fucking get out of bed till time to go to work but he can't take the time to take care of her when she wakes up.  I have to get up after being asleep for an hour or a little more and stay up until she goes back to sleep and then get up with her in the morning.

All he does is bitch bitch bitch about how he is so fucking tired, excuse me but I do believe that you get a full nights sleep and uninterrupted at that.

I am so tired of his attitude, he thinks he is the only person that is tired or hurts.  He asks me how I am doing and I tell him and all I get is ""well I am such and such too"". No I am sorry is there anything I can do, would you like me to watch Amanda so you can get a quick nap, no would you like me to get you something so you feel better?, no just ""I feel that way too"".

Not only that but he bitches too that he doesn't get any appreciation.  Well hello again, do I get any appreciation for what I do?? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  I keep the house clean, I make sure the laundry is done, I take care of Amanda and do I hear any thank yous from the asshole, NOOOOOOOOOOO.  But he expects me to tell him thank you for going out and working.  Well you know what buddy boy, the road goes both ways and if you want some respect and appreciation maybe you should start at home with the wife and child you have.

He expects me to wake him up in time to go to work, he expects me to have a pot of coffe waiting for him, he expects me to stay up and wait on him for when he gets off work.  But does he say thank you, does he get up early to spend time with me?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

OH and get this, he bitches that he only gets one day off a week and that he doesn't get to just sit around and be a bump on log.  Well HELLO! I haven't had a fucking day off since Amanda was born!  Do you hear me bitching that I can't sleep in for as long as I want, do you hear me bitching that I can't sit in front of the tv and do nothing but watch the mold grow, do you hear me bitching that I have to do housework all the time???  NO and do you know why?  Because I know that my life is not my own, that everything I do if for Amanda.  She needs a clean house, she needs someone to get up and take care of her when she wakes up, she needs interaction while up so the tv is only on for noise.

I am almost at the end of my rope and it takes a damn lot for me to get to that point.

He can't even put his dirty laundry in the fucking hamper which happens to be in his closet which he gets into to get dressed.  How long does it take to pick up a few articles of clothing and put it into a hamper that is already there.  It isn't like he has to go walking down the street to do it.  Oh and his chefs coats can't seem to make it up stairs but have to remain on his chair.  Excuse me but you have to go upstairs to go to bed and you can't take 2 seconds to pick up the coat and put it in the hamper?  Guess not.

Oh and don't get me started on his glasses.  He has glasses in his car and on his side of the bed but they can't seem to make it into the house and into the kitchen.  How long does it take to grab a glass that is on the seat next to you or on the night stand next to you and bring it into the kitchen, I mean you are in there after you wake up to get a cup of coffee and you go into the kitchen when you get home to get a glass of water so why can't they go into the kitchen with you.

I am so pissed right now.  I am so ready to throw in the towel.......Amanda and I don't deserve this and yet he thinks we do.  Just because his daddy did the same to him and his mom doesn't mean he needs to do it to me.

Last night I slept on the couch because he feel asleep and not once did he get up and see what was going on.  Not once did he come and see if there was something wrong and that was why I wasn't in bed.  No his happy ass was in bed sleeping and he didn't give a damn.

Not once last night did he ask if there was anything he could do to help with Amanda, not once did he say, do you need to go to the bathroom?  No it was I am being kept up and I am going to go to bed no matter the fact that you have been up longer than I have.

Oh and he says that what I do isn't a real job and that who ever said being a house wife was hard work needs to be smacked!

Yet on the one day he had off my best friend had to babysit him so that he would baby sit Amanda so I could get some cleaning done.  How sad is that.

Well I am done with my rant.  I am going to go and cry now.
Sorry for all the language but I am just too damn angry right now to care."

"event","He tells me don't worry things will work out.  I will find another job I just don't want to go back to work where I am.  Fine that is great.  He tells me that he will start looking for work immediately.  Great I fell okay with that.

But has he?.......

NO on so many levels.

All he does is sleep all day and then stays up all night watching cable.  

Don't tell me everything is going to be alright when you are not doing a damn thing about the situation.

As it is it looks like I am going to have to get a job, put my daughter in day care and still not have anything to live on.  

Good bye apartment, good by cable, good by electric, good by everything because all he is doing is sleeping his life away.  Oh and his mother tends to think I have to do everything so he does get a job.  I'm sorry but I didn't have someone drop a job in my lap, I had to work for it too.

Sorry for the rant but I am pissed right now."

"event","Things with my fiance and I haven't gotten too much better.

He now works some where else that is better but he still won't talk to me.

Yesterday I had to go to the emergency room, I was cramping and not feeling too good.  The staff there were unable to determine what was causing the cramping so they referred me to an OBGYN in the hospital.  I was in the er from 12 am to 5 am and then was up again at 9 to see if I could get into the OB that I wanted.  Alas it just wasn't in the cards.  So I called the OB that I was referred to and got an appointment for 1:30 pm.  I laid back down becuase I was already feeling weak from the 4 vials of blood that was taken from me in the er. After a two hour nap I was up again getting ready for the doctors appointment.

It took me an hour to get my fiance's butt moving saying he was just tired.  HE HAD MORE SLEEP THAN ME and he was tired.  Come on, I am the one that is pregnant yet he is acting more like it than I am.

Anyway got to the doctors and he said that according to the information that the er sent everything is normal at this time and that they were able to detect the baby's heartbeat (YEAH!!).  So I got to go through my first prenatal visit with included being proded on.  Now before I was pregnant I didn't like going in for my physical but now with all that is going on, I really hated it!  Anyway after all that the doctor felt that everything is normal for right now and that he is going to wait to see if the cramping either subsides or increases and in two weeks I get to go back and have an ultrasound done and an diabeties test done.

Now with all things considered having 4 vials of blood taken shouldn't seem that bad, however; the er didn't get all they needed because they needed to send off to a seperate lab.  So here I am having been stuck once already going down to outpatient and getting, you guessed it, 4 more vials taken.  I have now been stuck in both arms and we are not done yet.  I have to go to the lab that my doctor uses and you guessed it give more blood.  Damn people, I am a human not a pin cusion.  Anyway that lab decided that 4 wasn't enough they needed 5.  So by the end of the day I had peed in a cup 3 times and given 13 vials of my blood.

After all that though I did find out that I am 6 weeks along and everything at this time is normal (YEAH AGAIN).

Now onto today, tried to get the fiance up and moving this morning because he had to be in to work at 7.  Yeah that wasn't fun, it took me an hour and 15 mins to get him modivated.  Then he came home in not so much of a good mood because the sluts that live upstairs from us decided that they were to lazy to take thier trash to the dumpster, instead they left it on the front porch.  It is nasty, stinky, and hot outside and they have chicken by-products in a bag in the heat, right where everyone has to come in.  Well he was ticked off about that.  

Well we have been looking for apartments to get out of this dump and away from the slum lord that runs it.  I found one that we could look at today so we took off. Cute, cute little apartment that would very much serve our needs but the land lord wants all the rent and deposit to rent it.  Problem.  We don't have that much and wouldn't be able to rent it until next week anyway.  So as we were leaving I was trying to tell him that we could work some magick and see if that was to be the one that we were to have.  You know, just a nudge in the right direction if it didn't impose on another if they really needed the apartment more than us.

He got pissy with me and all negitive and then started saying it was all 'thier' fault that he should be making more than what he is and that he should be in a better position than he is.  I tried to get him to realize that he was being negitive and he just won't hear it.  Then he wonders why now I am acting like I am pissed off and such.  Well gee lets see.  I went through 3 years of therapy and 2 years of hard work to get rid of the negitive thinking and work on positive thinking because if you are negitive all the time you will draw negitive to you but no he won't hear it.  He isn't being negitive, he is just being practical.  Can we say DENIAL!

So now I am here in another room of the apartment and he is in the living/bed room and neither of us are talking.  Real good for the relationship isn't.

You know today I just realized that maybe I shouldn't have gotten pregnant, because this is just not worth it. The pain I can handle, yeah at times it makes me cry and sick but having him make me feel like I am the cause of all our worries just isn't worth it."

"event","Today has been pretty good I guess.  It is hard to say right now.  When I moved here to be with my Fiance everything was wonderful and fun.  Then he got a job that turned out to not be as good as he wanted and he felt he had let me down some how.  He started backing off and not talking to me, I felt us drifting apart and up until two nights ago we were no longer a couple.  

Last night when he got home he had made huge strides to make things right and it was nice to have the man I love back.  

For me I am on an emotional roller coaster.  Earlier today I was happy and cooking and cleaning and just being myself and then I had to go and watch a movie that made me sad.  I don't know if it is because of the pregnancy or what but one moment I am happy and ready to go on with life and then moments or hours later I am saddened and ready to just curl into a ball.

The handfasting is moving right along.  Last month we were still in a probationary stage where we had to wait 6 months before planning and then a year and a day before making it legal.  However since my fiance and I are living together I talked with my elder and officiant and she agreed that if things are still going on track then we will make this handfasting legal. See since we are living together we are already meeting the requirements of living together and getting to know each other so why not move the legal ceremony up.

Finding out I was pregnant was a real joy, mainly because I never thought I could conceive.  Well here I am and nothing bad has happened but now I have a mix of emotions. Will I be a good mother, will I be able to handle the child birth, will we be able to afford things when they come up.  Stuff like that.  Also I haven't told my family yet so that makes me kinda sad as they can't share in my joy not that they would anyway.

Well enough of my ramblings tonight.  I am hoping that things will start looking up and that we get on our feet real soon."

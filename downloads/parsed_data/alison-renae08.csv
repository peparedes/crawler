People die

"event","don't tell me you understand me and my feelings on what im about to say if you don't because i will get extremely madd at you because like, i hate it when people do that. but just stop and really try to figure out what im saying.

I'm meloncholy. please dont pretend to understand why. I'm in a crowded room screaming out a name, and the wrong person is turning around. My world is spinning in unstopable circles to the point where my grip has disinigrated and I'm hanging on by a thread. But at the same time... I've given up complete control, and now that my personal control has expired, I'm even more so meloncholy, but I dont wanna blow it up, because when I get like this, I dont even know how to talk, which usually comes before thinking to me.

all I need is air in my lungs, and I'm well on my way to happiness. There are so many types of people in the world, even though we're all the same bloddy spiecies, and how dumb is that? I can handle any combo of people thrown at me. Life is a gift not to be wasted, and I'm just now thinking... and it feels like the first time I've ever thought. If you are in a crowded room, screaming so loud that you can feel it in the back of your throat, people should hear you, right?

If only one person turns around - not because they hear you, but because they were listening - something makes that person stand out to you in a way that cant be explained."

this guy jeffery, oh man, im like falling head over <br>
heals for the guy. i don't really know him that much<br>
but the feeling inside of me is like over whelming<br>
i can't stop talking about him, or thinking about him<br>
and wondering what he's doing, and what's go come<br>
it's like so much is going on right now with michael<br>
ormiston, and im like really pissed off, but when i <br>
think of him, it's like everything is perfect, and okay<br>
again, and im just counting down the days until i see<br>
him again [saturday] and i just want to know if he's <br>
going to be worth all of the pain and agony that is<br>
yet to come. im so happy that i feel this way again<br>
i haven't felt like this since i was like, liking michael<br>
like 4 months ago. haha. and that's like amazing. im <br>
just so syked to be able to see him and be with him <br>
and be sleeping a whole 50 feet away from him for<br>
a whole entire week. and to know i ran through his <br>
mind for that one moment when he said bye to me<br>
or that one moment when he looked at me, or that<br>
one moment when we actually talked, is amazing<br>
im so ready for this, and i know pain is going to come<br>
but right now, it's all worth it. im ready for the pain<br>
i'll be able to deal with as i always am, and god will <br>
be there helping me through. im just so ready for this<br>
and btw to everyone who didn't know me and samantha<br>
braasch got in this huge argument for the millionth fucking<br>
time. but it's all over now and we are cool, and i hope <br>

listen to me im tired of you, i don't want to be friends, i don't want to talk to you, i don't want to hear about you, or see you, or think about you, or anything i want nothing to do with you. i don't even want to cross your mind in fifteen years i want away from you. all you do is try to make my life miserale, you try to talk to me and get no where, you try to tell me who my friends are and more than eighty percent of the time you are wrong. you need to get your facts straight and stop talking for people, you need to get your head out of your ass and stand up to the fucking world. [excuse my language]stop trying to make me feel low and self centered, and stop trying to make yourself feel better. i never did a damn thing wrong to you, all i ever did was be there for you and try to help you but you took it and threw it in my face, so now you have nothing and never will have nothing even, if you are ever man enough to try and apologize, im not accepting it, i dont' care anymore, im so sick of getting made fun of by selfish people like you that have no life , and nothing better to do. and maybe if you weren't such a player and cheat on every damn girlfriend you have and have sex with one in the damn move theater, you'd have a better life and mroe people would like you. . . but that's just like what you said to me, i don't know who your friends are , and quite frankly, i don't care either just leave me alone and stop talking about me, stop telling people you want to talk to me stop everything because im sick of it and im sick of you, and im done with it, and im never turning back on these words ever again, this is final , i was deciding to be ""nice"" tonight, and let you talk, but i'll never make a stupid decision like that ever again, screww you michael ormiston i really don't like you.

<br>
okay so like i don't even know what's going on. im like so confused.
but not too sure about what. ugh it's like i talk to one guy and like.
i am like . falling and then i talk to another and the other one
doesn't matter anymore. i don't know .. it's making feel un
comfortable. but i guess only i can stop it .. right? or not . i don't
know. man i can tell you i felt proud of myself tonight. giving someone
advice. i learn from the best, like therese marie, haha, and beverly
maria. it's like what they tell me. i don't really . use until . i stop
think about it twice, and then it comes into play. i love it too. but i
gave someone advice tonight. and i really think i made a difference and
if anyone feels the way i do when that happens, you knwo it's an
amazing feeling [: and that's for sure. i mean come on im not stopping
my self anymore im not holding back, if i have feelings im going to let
them out. and people tell me im BRAVE for it. oh you are brave for
telling him you like him, no, it has nothing to do with being brave, it
has to do with, knowing your priorities, and knowing what you need to
tell people. what if the guy that is totally in love with me and im
totally in love with him. what if i don't tell him and then something
happens to either him or i the next day, i'll never knwo what could
have been. i don't want to live wishing i would have done this. i want
live knowing i did do it. and knowing that i don't regret anything in
my life. and i'll never once regret something if it caused me at some
point to smile. :) yah know ? so yeah. just like a great example
beginning of the year this year i got in this fight with my
bestfriend(S) and it sucked like a bunch it was in december and they
talked about me and turns out it was just one bestfriend it was a group
of us, so i had to say goodbye to that group of friends and soon enough
i started hanging out with others and became more popular and things
and then on the last day of school, we made up, me and my two
bestfriends, and it was like the greatest thing that has like ever
happened to me :] not really but okay, but anyways, but i was thinking
, if that one fight didn't happen i wouldn't be where i am right now i
wouldn't have half the friends i do. if my dad wasn't in the military
chances are you wouldn't be reading this right now. so i mean. things
do happen for a reason and when things do happen the reason it is
happening is THERE just you can't see until you stop and think about
it. and im doing that now, so again i say, don't let lifes troubles
bring you down. get out there and have a life that you won't regret :)
. <br>
<br>
commmmment please :)<br>"

So you've spent the best years of your life studying to become a journalist or a politician or something important that involves suits and big words. Then one morning you wake and someone higher up the social ladder will ask you to maneuver yourself into an awkward position to hold a microphone. Of course you can't refuse! You might as well kill yourself at that point.  

Dear sir who was hiding behind those chairs, 

Everyone was focused on the sour looking lady, but don't fret I noticed you and I'm proud of you for doing that crappy job. I really hope I'll see you in ten years or so as a secretary of state or a badass journalist.

Best regards,

A girl who knows that in a couple of years she has to take on a lot of crappy jobs too to get somewhere in life"

You can learn a lot from people just by listening how they, as recipients, respond to the questions posed by their friends on the phone. Yesterday I was on one of my journeys to the center of the universe, and the train was a perfect place to start my research. I was in a Linnaeus mood and decided to classify them into categories. One of the specimens was talking to his friend (I presume) and for twenty minutes he just kept asking questions but never answered a question himself. So I decided to put him into the shy-boring category. But then in the time lapse that the train hits a railroad switch, the moment when you bump into the creepy obese person sitting next to you even though you tried your hardest to avoid physical contact, that moment, I felt sorry for him and wondered if anyone had asked him how he was doing today.

Or maybe the guy was just related to Socrates and had inherited that dreadful quality of asking questions."

When stand up comedians don't create a proper story line or at least some kind of transition to their next story or joke. If I want to look at someone basically reading all their jokes out loud, I could buy one of those 'how to be funny for dummies' books and look at myself in the mirror.

What's up with the self-deprecating humor lately? Get yourself together soldier.

I want to write about a lot of things; books, films, thoughts, international affairs, your mom but I'm not sure if this is the right place. You see I put off writing in this journal because I don't feel as if I'm writing for myself, but for an audience and I don't want to bore you to death, so I try to make these blog posts interesting. You really don't care about how a bird pooed on my window and that it's way too cold outside to clean the spot so now I'm going to cut an image from a magazine and stick it on my window so I don't have to look at it. 
I don't want to bore you with my personal details. But then again, this is a <i>journal</i> not a column in a fancy schmancy newspaper. I can do whatever I want with this....(if you belong to snor, please erase all dirty thoughts RIGHT NOW). 

Talking about dirty (see that's a transition right there! Take that boring comedians!), my computer screen is so freaking dirty that I have to hire a whole legion of cleaning ladies or gentlemen to clean it. At first, I didn't realize it was so icky, until I kept seeing photos of people with spots on it. I first laughed out loud because I thought they were just ugly until I scrolled down and realized that the spots kept reappearing... yeah. 

See, this is the reason I don't update this journal."

Whenever I look at paintings of women made by 'modern' artists (this one is by Corneille), my first reaction is always: geez, all their models must have been so freaking ugly. But then of course I realize that it's just art, and that they were probably really hot. It must have been weird though to look at a modern art painting of yourself. Just imagine what their reaction must have been. ""My ass looks too big/I'm not blue/I don't have monobrows/I'm not that fat"". But they probably just said: omg that's amazing and then cursed the painter when they were alone.

See, being pretty isn't everything.

But if these painters made pretty girls ugly, would they then make ugly girls pretty in their paintings?"

"event","I'm back. Blahblah. So a couple of weeks ago I saw Once Upon a Time in the West for the first time. My expectations weren't really high. I thought that nothing could top The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. No wait, I actually thought I would just hate the whole film. I never really liked spaghetti westerns (or so I thought, but damn that term always makes me feel hungry). Because, what's so interesting about sweaty men who squint a lot? Just give them deodorant and sunglasses, that will solve the whole plot. Well, I was so wrong. Everything about that film was amazing, except for the fact that Cheyenne dies (oops, spoiler alert, but I think no one on my flist cares, and the people who do care have seen the film already). Why do those broody men who have a mysterious past but turn out to be good guys in the end have to die. Damn. 

In other news, I've been reading Bird Song and it's so awful. The book sounds nice, first world war, tragic love story, <s>hawt main character</s>. All the ingredients for a perfect book, right? Wrong. The characters are fucking annoying, let me show you:
Main character: I can't stop thinking about you! I want to get into your <s>pants</s> skirt and have hot making love time even though you're already married 8D!
French lady: OKAY :D, Ohh Stephen I've never felt like this with anyone before
Main character: ooh cherie let's run away
French lady: : D OKAY
*A couple of days later*

many things going on in my life now. Things like finding out what I am going to have for breakfast tomorrow, where my pink socks are and how to make a  chocolate cake, and emo real life stuff, that I can't keep this (=online life) up anymore. 

It's not like I update this journal regularly, but I would still like you all to know that my life is on a hold for the next 1.5 - 2 years. So I won't update live journal, and you probably won't be able to reach me for a long time. But, just because you won't be able to talk to me doesn't mean that I won't continue stalking you and reading all your entries (and maybe even commenting *gasp*). So don't remove me from your friends lists kthnxbai.
And don't cry. I will be back before you know it. I might travel the world for a couple of years and come back with stories of hairy arabic traders with curly beards who wanted to sell me strange objects, or French people who tried to slap me with baguettes, or that I met a strange man who looked like a vampire in Transylvania.

You guys have been a wonderful audience. Good night."

"event","Today I decided to wear tights and a dress with hearts on it to school to show my love to the world. It wasn't one of my best ideas in my short life span because the moment I stepped outside it started to rain. I'm not talking about oh I'm singing in the rain I'm so happy these small rain drops are so cute. I'm talking about serious Zeus is fucking pissed off/Damn where is Noach's ark when you need it rain. Of course, when I arrived at school it stopped raining. Aah, the story of my life.

But when I was on my way to school I admitted that not only I'm unhealthily obsessed with my historical heroes, but that I want to be like them. I want to be just as great, no, I want to be better than all others. I'm slightly worried about my strange life ambition, seeing as all my historical heroes were insane and geniuses at the same time, they died young and had bad habits. I guess I should take up drinking and prepare myself to die young and/or tragic. I assume that I should also get a sex change seeing as all my heroes are men. I need to work out so that I can escape the island where people who hate me will exile me to, and so that I can keep up with those long daily marches. Oh, and I need to find a soul mate. Hello world, where is my Patroclus? 

Sigh, I have a gazillion things to do. But I know I can do it. Please send me money for my sex change and I'm taking volunteers for my army."

"event","Hello world I turned eighteen today.

<img src=""http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g266/jusdepommes/18.jpg"">

Unfortunately these past years I didn't meet my Prince Charming, I didn't get a letter from Hogwarts, my parents didn't tell me I was a princess who was adopted or a girl from the moon who can't get home, I didn't get super powers, I didn't meet a best friend who would become my side kick, I'm not a descendant from a great historical figure, I'm not destined to become the new Xena or Indiana Jones.

Still, I don't think these eighteen years have been a waste. Even though I like to make jokes about how I have wasted my life it really wasn't. It was great to roll around in the snow when I was three, to make drawings for other people with my childhood friend, to collect spice girls pictures, playing hide and seek, growing up between different cultures and traveling a lot, curling up in my bed and crying until there are no more tears left, learning different languages, making new friends, losing friends, being emo and extremely happy, staying up late at night to study for exams, bicycling through (snow) storms, having different obsessions, pretending to be a writer, playing lots of video games, dancing to cheesy pop songs from the 90s, making earrings out of cherries, carving hearts in apples, looking up to starry skies and realizing that  I'm truly made out of stardust, falling asleep on trains, laughing so hard that I almost can't breathe, watching cheesy asian dramas, meeting the most amazing people on the internet, doing absolutely nothing and reading Anderson fairy tales while a cheesy b action film serves as my reading light because all the other lamps in the room didn't work.

This wasn't a waste. 

Bring on the new year! BRING ON <S>THE Pr0nN</s> LIFE!"

<a href=""http://oxalic.intensify.org"">Oxalic</a>: thank goodness for darwin's unflagging optimism

I'm sorry Sabrina, I used you as an introduction for my blog entry. If you feel dirty right now I suggest a shower. But I did link you. And I think everyone should read your brilliant blog. So there. Please accept my promotion for your website as a prostitute would accept 500 euros for a hard night's work at the red light district in Amsterdam. Just kidding, just kidding. Please forgive my insolent jokes, but everyone who's reading this: visit <a href=""http://oxalic.instensify.org"">her blog</a>. Now. 

So my disciples. Have you all spread my teachings while I was gone? Well, I wasn't really gone. I just went undercover on the internet. I visited websites, message boards, etc anonymously.

I have a secret to tell you all. I'm not really jusdepommes. I was sent here by God, G-D, Allah, The Almighty One, The Big Guy There High Up In The Sky, to keep close tabs on you all. And my mission is almost completed, so I'm going back up to heaven soon. I can already tell you that some of you won't be up there in heaven with ADSL internet. You will burn in hell with a dial-up modem forever and ever and ever. 

My last orders will be to play this simulation: <a href=""http://www.3rdworldfarmer.com/"">3rd World Famer</a> and pass <s>my teachings</s> the link on."

It's Holi today. Why do Hindus always have the best holidays? It makes me want to become one. Or a more realistic plan is to find a friend who is Hindu <s> so that I can beg</s> so that he/she can invite me to one of his religious festivities. I also want a Jewish friend. Purim anyone? I want to dress up as Esther so badly, and make noise with a ra'ashan. Life isn't fair.

Do you guys also hate it when your thoughts go too fast to write down? I mean, you're already writing something but your mind keeps blabbing on about those cool things and you have to hurry up
to write it down or else they will float away.

Or is it just me?

<i>Hoisting high that olive stake with its stabbing point,
straight into the monster's eye they rammed it hard-
I drove my weight on it from above and bored it home 
as a shipwright bores his beam with a shipwright's drill
that men below, whipping the strap back and forth, whirl
and the drill keeps twisting faster, never stopping-
So we seized our stake with its fiery tip
and bored it round and round in the giant's eye
til blood came boiling up around that smoking shaft 
and the hot blast singed his brow and eyelids round the core and the broiling eyeball burst
its crackling roots blazed
and hissed-
as a blacksmith plunges a glowing ax or adze in an ice-cold bath and the metal screeches steam
and its temper hardens-that's the iron's strength
so the eye of the Cyclops sizzled round that stake!

My poster not the guy you pervert! I wonder if he's trying to tell me something...

Some time ago I got tagged by <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/finwen"">Finwen</a> to name ten of life's simple pleasures that you like most, and then pick ten people to do the same. I've been planning to do this (insert number here) things you don't know about me and don't want to know thing. Usually the weird things about me are the things I enjoy. And the things I enjoy are usually the simple things in life. So here's is a list that you don't really care about:

1. I like breathing

2. I like looking up b list actors, people that just walked by in films and had no role at all, or people that starred in crappy b films a very long time ago. I like looking them up on IMDB and finding out if they have played in other films, what they're doing now etc. 

3. I like listening to music and turning the volume up when no-one is around, close my eyes and <i>feel</i> the music around me. This usually works well with classical music.

4. I like bicycling through rain and snow storms

5. I like watching the curtain flutter when the windows are open

6. I like laughing

7. I like listening to the sound of rain drops before I go to sleep

8. I like getting goosebumps when I read literature, hear a nice piece of music or see a wonderful landscape

9. I like being without worries (I worry about everything)

10. I like thinking about strangers that I see around me and wonder if they're happy.

11. I like waltzing to Tchaikovsky's music

12. I like preserving memories

13. I like long msn conversations with my online friends

14. I like chaos

Okay, that was it. I love and hate gazillion things but being mysterious is sexy (:P) so I'll shut up now.
Oh, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/noxangelus"">Mae</a> tagged me to do this what does your lj name mean meme.

Have you ever noticed that when you're on whatever kind of public transport and the phone rings that everyone looks up and immediately thinks that they're the ones who are getting the phone call. And when they realize that it's not their phone they look disappointed and jealous to the one who is having the phone call. Or is it just me? Silly people, they're so afraid to be alone for just one second. 

I feel like taking a walk through the woods tonight with someone. So that we can talk about books, god, where Ariel Sharon is and debate if the light really goes out in the refrigerator when you close it.

I'll probably just fall asleep in my favourite reading chair with a cup of chocolate milk next to me...

Yeah, I don't understand either why he's wearing nylon stocking on his head either. 

Friend: omg, I love 50cent and his music. He's really cute too!! : D
Me: .... the only thing I noticed about him is that he always keeps his mouth shut when he raps or sings. I just want to yell at him ARTICULATE ALREADY >(!
Friend: aaaaww, don't be so harsh! The thing is, he got shot once nearby his mouth and his voice changed and he can't rap as good as he used to
Me: what the fuck?! If his voice changed and he can't rap as good as he used to THEN WHY DOESN'T HE STOP? That's 
just like when an athletic runner gets shot in his legs and has to get his legs amputated. DOES HE STILL KEEP ON RUNNING? I DON'T THINK SO!
Friend: .... 
Me: Yes, you just got PWNED

*sigh* I don't think I'll ever understand rappers

Other things that annoyed me today
*People not knowing who Alexander the Great is. HERETICS > (
*Me finishing my english assignment extremely early in the morning. Trying to get upstairs with my eyes half closed,
trying to relax in bed and looking at the ceiling then realizing THAT THERE'S A GIGANTIC SPIDER CRAWLING ON THE CEILING. After having killed him with some kind of useless ""these are the rules if you want to work in the computer room"" paper and waking up everyone with my screams and jumps on my bed, I couldn't get to sleep. Because I kept thinking about the spider's family who would want to revenge tiny spider's death and kill me in my sleep. OMG THE SPIDER MAFIA!
Random Spider: Don Spider, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home. What can I do for you *random spider kisses one of the spider's legs*.
Don Spider: I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse. 
Random Spider:  I pledge my ever-ending loyalty to you Don Spider
Don Spider: Then go and kill the girl who KILLED TINY <s>Tim</s> SPIDER. 
etc etc

WTF, but then I thought: hey I always keep telling myself that I'll run away and join the circus so why won't I give it a shot?

To keep it short, I couldn't do anything what the guy asked us to do. 
I feel disappointed, it was my dream to runaway to a circus and I have no idea what to do now.

Anyway, I saw Terry Pratchett, Diane Duane and Alan Lee. It was grand! I also got almost hit by an arrow because of those stupid LARP (Live Action Roleplaying) people.
Oh well, I had fun. I laughed at people who looked silly. I bought a couple of cheesy fantasy books and I enjoyed the wonderful scenery (it was at a castle!). 

from <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/applejack"">Applejack</a>:

<b>1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me.""

2. I will respond by asking you five questions. I get to pick the questions.

3. You will update your LJ with the answers to the questions.

4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the same post.

5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.</b>

<lj-cut text=""My funky questions asked by Applejack""> 
<b>1. What is your favorite type of music and favorite band within that genre?</b>
I like every kind of genre. There's always at least one song in every genre that I like. My music list looks really weird. I listen to
Metallica, Edith Piaf, Massive Attack, Frank Sinatra, Moby, Alanis Morisset, Dean Martin, Madonna, Pink Floyd, Michael Jackson, The Decemberist, Coldplay, Black Sabbath, Tori Amos, Itzhak Perlman, Mozart, Beatles, Franz Ferdinand, Keane, Queen, Therapy, The Cure, The Decemberist, Celtic/Instrumental music, movie/game soundtracks and the list goes on and on and on. I'll listen to everything. There's even one song in the hiphop genre that I like and it's called you can't touch this by MC Hammer. 
I usually just like a couple of songs from a band/singer. For example: I love Thriller, Billie Jean, Beat it, Black or White and Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson but those are the only songs that I like which are made by him. I do have a favorite song! It's Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen <3. But I guess my music taste leans more towards alternative music than anything else. 

<b>2. What is your favorite season and why?</b>
Autumn! Because of all those colorfull leaves.

<b>3. If you pull out three of your favorite socks from your sock drawer, what color or what pattern are each one?</b>
My first one would be my first toesock ever. It has stripes on it in different colors and it makes you feel really happy when you 
look at it. 

The second one would be a plain white sock. But it's  <i>the perfect</i> white sock. It has the perfect size because I really hate those short ankle-height socks and the socks are so soft (even after washing it a gazillion times) that you want to wear them all the time. I just love those socks <3

My third one would be a pair of long blue socks which has stars in different colours on them. It looks really funky! 

<b>4. When did you start designing webpages and why?</b>
Oh man. I can still remember the day when I made my first website but in order to tell you the whole story I have to introduce you to AGP aka Phoenix. I met Phoenix at some kind of rpg forum. She opened a topic about tekken pictures and we started talking. I had made plans for my own website. It was going to be about girls in video games and sailormoon. Phoenix finished her first website about tekken and final fantasy avatars and I asked her if she wanted to make a website with me. She said yes and that was the beginning of our first website called: Gaming Girls. That was 4 years ago. I really can't say why I started web designing. 
I just wanted to make a website because it seemed fun and I was really bored.

<b>5. Where would be your ideal place to live when you are older?</b>
Ooh I want to live everywhere. I really don't want a job where I'll travel just once a month. I want to live a couple of years in  different countries. England France, Australia, Japan, US, New Zealand, Scotland etc. Right now my first goal is to move to England. I really want to live there. I don't think that I could live in one country for the rest of my life. Maybe that has got to do with the fact that I'm an expatriate? 
</lj-cut>

Today is the last day that I'm 15. I wonder if I'll still be this annoying girl that I'm right now when I wake up tomorrow."

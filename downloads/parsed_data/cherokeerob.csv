"event","I won my wrestling match last night, which is really great news.  I would have been so ****ed if I had lost all that weight and then lost, especially since I lost it all in one day.
  Even though I won my match and a few other people won theirs, the team still lost.  If we hadn't had to forfeit 2 matches and had 1 disqualification then we might have had different results.
  The referee last night was an asshole.  He so totally was not calling fairly.  He screwed P.J., Robert P., Cameron, Chris, Blake, and me.  I wanted to deal with him as badly I did that lady's voice.
  There was a large lady in a dark pink shirt sitting on the first row of bleachers last night cheering.  Her voice was so terrible.  It was like a screechingbird cry.  I wanted to murder her voice so badly.
  Only 4 more days of school, including today, and then we have a 5 day weekend for Thanksgiving.  The days just aren't going to pass by fast enough.  I'll probably eat like a glut over the holiday and be overweight when I come back.  Then I'm going to have to run some more.
  Michelle can't access LiveJournal from her school because it's blocked.  Too many students were posting things relating to the school, and the school considered it a security threat.
  I'm so glad I can eat again for at least the next couple of days.  Not eating yesterday until a little after 6:00 PM was kicking my ***.  The less you eat the more you cherish food.
  I've got a project due in 4th period tomorrow but I don't how to do it.  The teacher gave us directions but she had so many typos and grammatical errors in them that it's very confusing.  You can tell she typed them up herself.  Also, it's an online project and some of the sites we need to use are blocked by WebSense.  I guess I've going to have to stay after practice tonight and work on it.
  I really need something to eat.  All I had yesterday was a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich, an apple, some water, and a crispy chicken club sandwich from McDonald's.  All I've had today is an orange Gatorade and a few swallows of water.
  Running isn't so bad after all.  I ran at least 4 miles yesterday and was just as hyper as could be afterwards.  Chris thinks I'm some kind of a demon and Crys thinks I'm strange.  I can't help it if I don't get tired easy.  Feel free to let your mind wonder on that last statement.
  Well, I'm going to get back to pointlessly surfing the web and checking my endless list of e-mail accounts.  Until next time, peace out."

"event","I'm sitting here in 4th period just chilling.  Actually I'm bored out of my mind.  We have a substitute teacher today.  Fun fun.
  Our first wrestling match is this afternoon at 7:00.  I'm supposed to be wrestling in the 119 pound divison but unfortunately I'm a little overweight.  Robert and I got out of second period so we could run off some weight but I only dropped down to 120.6 pounds.  I'm going to run some more this afternoon before the weigh-in which is at 6:00.
  I haven't eaten anything today because I'm trying to lose weight, and I've only have maybe 2 or 3 swallows of water.  I am so hungry.  There's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and an apple waiting for me in Coach Miner's office.  I can't eat it though until after I weigh in.
  Robert, the coaches, and I discovered in second period that the scales we've been using aren't trued.  Everytime somebody weighed in, their weight either was ?.0 or ?.8.  The first time I weighed in after running I weighed 121.0.  The second time, like 5 minutes later, I weighed 121.8.  After that, Coach Miner went to get Doc's scale which is more accurate.  When I weighed myself that time I weighed 120.6.
  I'm going to try to get back to work now.  It's not going to make a difference if I do or not though since only about 12 minutes left of class.
  Later people.  Peace out.

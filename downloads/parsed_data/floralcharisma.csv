"event","well I'm at home right now from break, and I've been trying out an anti-depressant called effexor. it's been working freakishly good and I hate that. I want to do it by myself. arg.

anyway, besides that I have finally decided to officially make and start my new-years resolutions. I am going to 
lose 15 pounds (oh don't we all make that resolution), 
stop biting my nails (this has been the standing resolution for my entire life), 
to floss my teeth, 
get my wisdom teeth out, 
get a job, 
exercise 4 times a week at the gym, 
make my boyfriend fall crazy, madly in love with me, 
and create a masterful painting on the giant canvas mom bought me."

"event","I went to his house again last night.
will I learn?

I get the feeling that I am in this for the long run, but that I'm wasting my time. this is getting way too hard for me. apparently, he 
     ""can't picture himself with anyone in the long run right now."" 
I was like geez don't pull my beloved knife out cause now I'm bleeding everywhere. also we were hanging around earlier not doing much, and I said something to the effect of, 
    ""I think a lot of people meet someone in college."" 
maybe this was stupid on my part but I was just talking. he says (really quickly), 
    ""that's for people who don't continue school after college."" 
I mean, why say that to your girlfriend? couldn't you just let me relish in my one-good-relationship ever, and pretend for a second that it might be possible for two good people to like each other and end up together? I KNOW it's a miserable fantasy, but why-oh-why can't I have it anyway?

I can't stand being with someone who thinks he's better than me. but at the same time, he makes me feel like I am worth it. ugh don't even say it, I know how stupid that sounded.

I'm going to go paint a masterpiece now (hey, misery is worth something!). bubye."

"event","alright well last night I did it again. I went out and got completely drunk, and morphed into my alternate ego for the entire night, which I cannot keep doing. my boyfriend was drinking too, but he definitely was not as messed up as I was. and like usual, we talked baout our relationship and what we think is happening, and like usual, I feel worse now than ever. I love him, and thinking about it is really starting to fill my days now. I guess unrequited love probably feels a lot stonger than regular love, if there is such a thing. it's so hard to come by nowadays, you think everyone would love whenever they got the chance. but no. 

he talked to his mentor, and told them that he was worried by his lack of jealousy over me. he feels that if he doesn't get jealous when messed up things happen, that means that he must not love me. I can hear the chains grinding in his head. he thinks way too much. just FEEL, don't think. 

anyway I'm gonna go downtown to clear my head, listen to some good music, and bond with myself. a very important thing that I tend to neglect. anyway,

also on the agenda for things I need to contemplate; 
1. how much longer can this relationship last? 
2. have we reached a dead end? 
3. can it last if one person says I love you and the other admits that their not sure? 
4. how much hurt should I endure for the person I love?"

"event","well staying in town when everyone you know leaves, is hard. I am bored and don't really know what I want to do with myself. I think part of the reason I feel so bad about doing nothing is only because I know people are going to ask me what I did today, and I will have nothing to say. I am always so afraid that I am boring people. I think people feel awkward around me and that really bothers me. I wish I could make people feel at ease instead of making them want to leave. so the gameplan is to search for a job today. I should haev done this much earlier, but with finals and everything, it really wasn't possible. that way I will have money and  something to fill my time for at least a little bit of my week. off I go. 
I hate I get up and want to go to the gym, but I want to take a shower, and since it's late I feel like if I do both then I will be screwed because it will be like 5 before I actually get dressed and then I will have no day left. anyway."

"event","today I have realized some things about myself, although I feel like I am always realizing something, and it is rarely ever good. I've always questioned my self-worth, but the trigger for this new set of emotions is my own fault. a few weeks ago I told my boyfriend I love him. I am one of those people who sometimes thinks that if you love a person you should tell them no matter what. as many people know, it's a very scary thing. and god do I wish I could take it back now. I was so nervous, and it took so much courage, because I've never been the first to fall in love. I am always the smarter, more thoughtful, more loved, more talented, more socially involved one in the relationship, and this one seems to leave me feeling so stupid and vulnerable. but I guess telling a person you love them isn't exactly the solution to feeling vulnerable. so obviously I didn't get an I love you back, and although I didn't want a knee-jerk response that night, I lose more hope every day. and now things between us seem to be just a little awkward. I feel hurt almost all the time, and I am constantly feeling more and more worthless. I completely thought that he loved me and everything had been going so great, and now I've gone and ruined it. you see, there had been some events leading up to that date that made me think he wanted me to commit a little more. and now I realize that he wasn't looking for an I love you, he was just enjoying the sex or something; the title of having a ""hot"" girlfriend. and maybe now he's woken up and seen that I am really quite unattractive.. I almost can't stand to see him anymore. I love him, and it hurts so bad. is love supposed to hurt? is that when you know it's ""bad"" love, or is that just the way it goes sometimes? maybe that's why they call it falling. you fall, it hurts. makes sense. anyway, also in the last couple weeks, I have been very sexually and emotionally confused about everything really, and it's lead me to do some really stupid un-me things. I'm acting insecure and immature, and I just can't seem to help doing these things. what scares me is that he started to like me in the first place because I was specifically not these things, and now I just can't help but think that this relationship can't go any farther unless I stop being depressing and stupid."

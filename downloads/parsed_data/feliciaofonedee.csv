"event","Today was replacement for public holiday so Cherie, Evelyn, Yi Shin, Wei Na, Angelica, Darren, Khang Siang, Jeremy&nbsp; and I went to Kallang Leisure Park to ice skate! We met at round 10.30am at Tampines interchange but I met them at Bedok MRT instead as the train would pass by Bedok on the way to Kallang. I missed the train that they were in so I took MRT to Kallang myself.&nbsp; Reached there with them waiting for me and because of my late arrival, they missed bus11. AH! Sorry guys. Waited for so long before another 11 came. And at around 12pm we were in the ice skating rink! YEAH! We were there for two hours and had super duper lots of FUNN! I skated with everyone and I tried to push Khang Siang down put failed D: he's too stable. But Jeremy was much better to push, I pushed and he FELL! Yesss. Suceeded. I skated with Yi Shin who skates so fasssttt. She is always skating in front of me. Evelyn, Cherie and Angelica was okay. And Wei Na was learning. For a beginner not bad, she fell 8 times only, better than Hua Yeow who fell 16 times the other time he went? So funny. After skating, went to eat KFC which I spilled my popcorn chicken, waste my money ): sigghhhh. But luckily left a few which filled my tummy up, YEAH! Then went to play Daytona and I played the basketball game, it was so fun but we could not break the record): After a while more, we went home. I went to play basketball with TingYing, Ellery and some other school people at 840 and went home at 6pm! It was super tiring ):"

"event","Fear is everyone's friend, coming and going as time passes. Sometimes, they are overcame, but sometimes they are just left there. Until the next time they are faced with the fear again, they panic. Well, let me ask you, whats the point? Isn't it better if you overcome your own fears before you are faced with it again? Like me, I have fear of heights and when we were faced with high elements training during out Adventure Training Camp (ATC), I was super scared as I was not really prepared to climb to such a great height but in the end I still conquered my fear of it! YEAH! Secondly, I have stage fright, especially commanding in front of a crowd. This morning I was super scared, its my first time commanding and I was scared something would go wrong and thankfully nothing of that sort happened. PHEW. I should overcome this fear real soon man so I can put the fear behind and move on! Moreover, these chances are hard to come by, so I must really treasure them! HAHAS. <br /><br /><br />Here are some inspirational quotes to overcom fear:<br /><br /><div class=""main12""><b>Robert Louis Stevenson</b><br />You cannot run away from weakness; you must some time fight it out or perish; and if that be so, why not now, and where you stand?<br /><br /><b>Nisandeh Neta</b><br /> Fear isn't an excuse to come to a standstill. It's the impetus to step up and strike.<br /></div>"

I study at least two hours a day e it science, math or history. I think its awesome. You study for yourself and not others right? YESS.<br /><br />And you have to be honest in this schedule! NO CHEATING :D In my opinion, I think that having a schedule keeps you more organised and let you know what you are doing. The day is also planned out nicely so you would not have to worry about not completing certain task and not knowing what to do next.&nbsp; Well, I think if we get the whole thing worked out, it would be better and you would not be panic about having to managing your time on that day itself. And if you follow strictly according to your time table, I think you would be the one who is benefitting at the end of the day! <br /><br />We are born to love LEARNING. And also, no one is born stupid so well, if we work hard, we will achieve our goals one day :D"

After side by side programme, Si Min and I went down to the canteen to help with the designing. While Evelyn and Joey went to the library to discuss about the math trail. The worst thing was I did not eat lunch that day ): Gosh, I was super hungry and my stomach was growling. And I thought of Gerald, Nicholas and the others who went to subway to eat and so I asked them to help me packet some back to school. They reached school at around five plus with the meal! WOOTS! Its like so filling, I was super hungry so I ate it super FAST, faster than my usual speed! [: And the snapple was niceee. The fact that was written at the back of the bottle cap was cool as well. It was something about strawberries. Then there was the lays potato chips! YEAH, love them. The whole meal was super filling! :D Want to thank Nic, Gerald and Julian for paying for me ;D ahas.

"event","The sec1 council induction camp was just over and IT WAS SUPER FUN! :D We, the sec2 councillors were faciliatotors and we came back for our holidays to do some tying of loose ends before the camp started. We started planning during our own sec2 council camp and then came back for about three times to plan and try some of the games. The meetings turned out well and then it was SEC 1 COUNCIL CAMP! (: The theme of the camp was octupus, objective being one efficient council and the main point of this camp was to allow the sec1s to bond together and not only mix round with their own comfort zone. Well, I must say the camp turned out rather successful as the main point of bonding the sec1s were achieved! YEAPYY! During the first day, after the registration, it was the sec1s workshop help by the high achievers coaches who are mainly coach Ernest and coach Jian Fen! They are nice and cool people man. During their three hour of worskshops, the sec2s were occupied with CAPTAINS BALL! I so love playing captains ball with the councillors. It was like so happy and my team won! But who cares, winning does not matter to me, what matters to me is that we had FUN and that we bonded! Yes, one of the purpose of playing captains ball was to help us spend our time away but another more important purpose is bonding! Since there are so many new sec2 councillors, we have to know each other better and this was the right time to bond. Through the captains ball or rather the whole camp, I made a lot of new friends and also, got to know each other better. After lunch, it was the sec1s another three hour workshop again, but this time the ex-co members had meeting and the rest of the sec2s watched the videos ""Facing the Giants"". According to some of them, the movie was nice and touching but I did not get to watch it due to ex-co meeting ): Well, anyway after their workshop, it was station GAMES! We asked them for opinions for the games after they finished playing and some wanted more games! PHEW, lucky they did not think it was boring. We could judge from this station games that the sec1s councillors are really trying hard to bond. When any of their team members failed to do something, they would cheer them on and made sure that they would not give up. From here, team spirit was shown. After which was I think err, dinner? After dinner was the part that&nbsp; I was looking forward to. Guess what it was ? NIGHT WALK! :D There were altogether about six stations in night walk. Mine was the ONE TWO THREE COMPUTERS, which is the computer lab three, together with EVELYN AND NIC WONG! :D They are fun people man. Nic was super funny he wanted to grab people's legs to scare them and he was like leaning against the wall, trying to scare the sec1s but too bad MISSION FAILED D: Imran was the station beside us and he was so FUNNY! He can be a comedian next time, he kept coming once in a while to entertain us, so nice of him man. And here are pictures of night walk! <br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feliciaofonedee/pic/00002bgx/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feliciaofonedee/pic/00002bgx/s320x240"" /></a><br />MY STATION PEOPLEE!<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feliciaofonedee/pic/00003afc/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feliciaofonedee/pic/00003afc/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />SEE, its FULL MOON!!<br /><br />So here's briefly what we did during night walk. After night walk was wash up and sleep! YES, sleep! But we had a bit of breifing before we slept. I had patrolling duty at night but I woke up late, clumsy me D: But I still woke up and was one hour LATE! AHH! After the patrolling, I tossed and turned and slept and woke up every one hour. So, I could not really sleep and the second day I was super tired. No energy to do anything but captains ball was the exceptional. Since we had another three hours of free time because of the sec1s final workshop, we played our last captains ball game together ): I enjoyed it! Finally after their workshop was over, we went for area cleaning and had a short award presentation before we break camp. Camp was fun and I learnt a lot of new things such as project management and everything. Thanks High Achievers, especially Coach Ernest, Coach Danielle and Coach Jian Fen and also sec1s and 2s councillors and lastly, Mr Kwok and Mr Tay for guiding us!"

Storyline:
Molly, Vicky and Grace are best friends in school but Vicky is jealous of the newcomer Grace, who had just joined them not long ago. Grace also talks to Molly's ex-fling Jason a lot, making people think that there is something going on between the two of them. Molly's mother cannot understand her and whats more disappointing is that her father is not good at pivotal moments. And her prince purple flower, which is a flower in her room, has also deserted her. Prince purple flower represented Jason last time, but now it was nobody, nobody knew about prince purple flower. Molly also kept a diary writing about her problems and secrets, including prince purple flower. But one day when Vicky went to Molly's house, she read the dairy without Molly noticing it and she found out that Molly actually stole candies together with Grace and of course about prince purple flower. And later when Vicky blurted about her knowing that Molly stole, Molly suspected that Grace told Vicky about it. But when Vicky continued about prince purple flower, she knew that Vicky had read her diary. She scolded and shouted at Vicky and her diary was being tore up by&nbsp; Vicky. Both of them cried and Molly was so angry that she chased Vicky out, telling Vicky that she will never forgive her. Their friendship was just broken by this incident. Had only Vicky not invade Molly's privacy, none of this will happen.

Reflections:
I feel that Vicky is in the wrong to even read Molly's diary without permission. I mean best friends trust each other, but Vicky broke this trust between them. Sadly their friendship was broken in this manner. If only Vicky was not that nosey parker, nothing of these sort will happen. So this shows that good friends should always trust each other and not let something which you have done spoil your friendships."

These men may or may not have been diagnosed with heart disease.</p>  <p>Though this condition occurs more often in older men because of clogging of the arteries, there are many complications that can arise in younger men too.</p>  <p>However, the cost of these tests are quite high. Dr Lam told The Straits Times that he believed it might cost about $3 million to screen 10,000 recruits.</p>  <p>""But, it would be money well spent as it prevents men in their prime from dying suddenly,"" he added.</p>  <p>Not all heart experts agree with him though.</p>  <p>Dr Lim Chin Hock, another cardiologist in private practice, said to The Straits Times: ""Even if we did all the tests for every recruit, it does not mean we will be able to avert all sudden cardiac deaths.""</p>  <p>For a healthy individual with no family history of heart disease, the chances of collapsing from SCD are small - estimated as one in 1,000.</p>  <p>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean told Parliament that in the preceding nine years, 19 Singapore Armed Forces personnel had died of sudden heart attacks - including five who collapsed during training.</p><br /><p><u><b>REFLECTIONS:<br /></b></u>I agree that they have to do their checkups thoroughly so that they can be prevented from going for vigorous exercises which might cause sudden deaths. However, they must also produce a medical record saying that they are unwell or else everyone would try to use the excuse of having heart problems to skip vigorouos trainings. Well, they must also keep fit at all times so that their bodies would be prepared for vigorous activities. And they must be aware of their own bodies, if they are feeling unwell, they should not carry on with their trainings. In addition, the commanders should pay more attention to those who have a family background of heart problems. But, judging at the cost, I do not think that it is affordable for all families. So, from here, we can say that this medical check up stuff has its pros and cons.<br /><u><b></b><br /></u></p>"

For me, I pronounce it as ikea, but for some, they pronounce as i-kea? So, which is which? Never mind about that. Personally, I like the hotdog bread in ikea! Its the most delicious hotdog bread that I have ever tasted. The sauce can be chosen and this ranges from tomato to chilli to mustard! In addition, the drinks are self serviced too! If you buy a drink and a hotdog, it would only cost $1.70, which is quite affordable and&nbsp; judging that we can choose our choice of drinks, the deal would be super good (: I would always think that the furnitures in Ikea are cool as they are arranged in such a way that its like the real bedrooms or living rooms in our house. Its creative the way they decorate the whole place. They sell loads and loads of furnitures that you can find almost everything there! And to tell the truth, most of the furnitures in my room are brought from ikea! On Tuesday, a few councillors and I went to ikea to get some things for the upcoming sec1 council camp. Ikea was so big that we took about half an hour to find the things that we wanted.

Storyline:
The author and her friend, Katie, were watching television at her house, and soon, the telephone rang, the author sprung for it. It turned out to be a call saying that the author's father has heart problems and was hospitalised. She was scared and sad at the same time and did what most of us would do, confiding in her friend, Katie. Katie also consoled her and let the author lean on her when she cried. 

Reflections:
Good friends should often console one another and also, being the one that each parties trust, we must try our best to learn how to console our friends and help them in times of need. That to me, makes a good friend, whom you can trust and turn to when you are down. Friends. Why do we have friends? Why do human need friends? Yes, making friends are essential in our lifes, they prevent you from turning lonely and friends brighten up your lifes! However, choose your friends wisely so that you would not mix with bad company. And even though if you come across any bad companies, try to tell them whats right and wrong and who knows; they might change! Thats what friends are for, to change and to lead you to the correct path. So, treasure your friends and love them as God teaches us to love your enemies as you love your friends. (:"

Storyline: 

Just because the author sat with Nikki, she was being avoided. Just beacause Nikki was a white and the author was a black, everyone despiced the author. To the author, there was absolutely nothing wrong with being friends with a white. But others do not seem that way, they humiliate the author, the blacks treats her as an outcast and the whites do not like Nikki. There was this strong racial discrimination between the people there. The blacks sat with the balcks and the whites sat with the whites, no doubt its this way. They only hang out with people of their own race. That was why they despiced Nikki and the author, because they think that blacks and whites cannot be friends. Despite of those people talking behind their backs, they remained as best friends. 

Reflections:

I think that both Nikki and the author are brave, they do not care about what others think about them but still continued to be best friends. Racial discrimination should not happen in the first place, whats wrong with both race being together? I think it would be a perfect idea if they do not seperate themselves and differentiate themselves as whites and blacks. This story is trying to teach us to do what you think is right and not think about what others think about you, if you do that, people would respect you and soon, if you are influential, others might just follow your footsteps as well. Wouldn't this help in contributing to a better world and a better place for us to live in. So, lets not differentiate ourselves using races but do what you think is right and what you think is best for the future."

Storyline: 

In this story, the author's father had a stroke and was sent to the hospital. The author could not accept and thus, bargained with God, asking him to spare his dad's life and he would not ask for anything else. In the end, the author's prayer was answered and his dad's survived. 

Reflections:

The moral of this story is to actually to realise that you have to cherish whatever you have now, and not wait till them to be taken away before you cherish them. Most of us I have to say, incliding myself, take things for granted, we either live in a well off family or was born to have maids or parents to serve them. Little did we know that once this people are gone, we have to depend on ourself! Thats why we have to learnt to treasure things before they are gone. One second they are here and the next, they aren't, just like shooting stars, one second you see them there, the other second you do not."

YEAH, I think I can(: WOAH, two weeks of holidays gone, thats real fast! Anyway, I do hope that school reopens soon, so that life would not be so boring. HAHAS. I am currently in the library with Hui Xuan, supposedly planning for the sec1 council induction camp. Like sorting things out, the loopholes and everything. But, we ended up having to chase people for their proposals, well, not exactly chase, but you know, just asking them to send Hui Xuan the proposal and then sending them to our coach as everything has to be finalised by tomorrow which is the 10th June. Proposal, sounds like some big word to me man, its like only those who are in business would use this so, why are we using this term, I feel so weird. But its like the coach is our boss, looking if our proposals are accepted or disapproved. Now I know how challenging it is to plan a camp. Planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating. Sounds easy, but when we actually do it, you realise that its not as simple as you think it is. Well, to say the truth, most of us have not planned an event before. Being inexperienced planners, there were obstacles here and there. Questions were also raised about our plans and we had to answer them using the best and feasible method. See, obstacles. They are like shadows lurking around everyday, following us everywhere we go and then ""pouncing"" on us every now and then. 

OH and I learned something yesterday from tution! (:
HOW ARE RAINBOWS FORMED?! 
Simple.
The sunlight acts a white light. And when it passes through the raindrops which acts as prisms, and when it passes through the prisms, the white light splits into seven different colours which are the colours of the rainbow. The colours are mainly red, orange, yellow, blue, green, indigo and violet. 
Uh huh, its that simple, now this question no longer remains in my head anymore! It feels so good that something is finally off your head. Now, I can concentrate on the planning for sec1 council induction camp, okay, off I go to check and prepare my proposal!"

"event","<u><b>New Singapore a less friendly city for tourists</b></u><br /><br /><p>AS A long-time admirer of Singapore, may I issue a well-meant warning that - well, bluntly, I think you've been carried away with your own success, and may be riding for a fall.</p>  <p>On a recent visit, I was disappointed to find more to dislike about Singapore than to like.</p>  <p>I formed the impression that Singaporeans have become grudging hosts to the tourists who are their lifeblood, and in a sense, seem to have developed an attitude towards them bordering on disdain, if not contempt.</p>  <p><script type=""text/javascript"" language=""JavaScript"" src=""http://www.asiaone.com/static/ads/scripts/adsimu.js""></script>I experienced this attitude on the street, in the shopping arcades, and in dealings with, for example, fellow diners, hotel reception staff, and specially among fellow passengers on the MRT.</p>  <p>Gone is the Singapore atmosphere I once knew so well, the hail-fellow-well-met friendliness, the welcoming smiles, the general good cheer and spirit of goodwill. The smiles have been replaced by a hard, cold stare.</p>  <p>I must admit my mood was soured from the outset by the music that kept my wife and me awake every night in our first-floor hotel room throughout our five-day stay - music that came and went in waves of noise, and sent me out into the corridor nightly to try to find if neighbouring guests were holding a private karaoke session.</p>  <p>On our last night, we were so racked by lack of sleep, I went down to the lobby to complain - and discovered that the source of the racket was an all-night bar in Kramat Lane where, it turned out, a pimp, and his 'stable' of two tattooed blonde trollops plus his two stand-by drivers were listening to the music and having the odd drink as they awaited calls from their punters.</p>  <p>Imagine my feelings when, promptly at 6am, the music stopped, the bar closed down, and the pimp and his two girls boldly walked into the lobby of our hotel - and caught the lift to their suite where, presumably, they would then sleep the day away after having ruined the night's sleep of their fellow guests on the lower floors opposite the bar.</p>  <p>My 5.30am call to the police resulted in a belated appearance by a sergeant and constable about 10 minutes after the bar closed. Had trouble getting transport, they explained. Hm...</p>  <p>Our hotel was grossly over-priced, and its 'continental' breakfast bordered on pigswill.</p>  <p>Thanks for the memories, Singapore - the old memories.</p><br /><p><u><b>REFLECTIONS:</b></u> <br /></p><p>After reading this article, I realised that more and more people are disliking Singaporeans. This to me is a very bad thing. Singaporeans are supposed to be friendly and nice people, and not regarded as unfriendly. I am quite sure that you all agree with me that we should change our image right? In my opinion, yes we should so that foreigners would change the view of us and not regard us as unfriendly and selfish people. If we change our image, people would come more often to Singapore and it will benefit Singapore. So whats the main cause of people saying that we are unfriendly? Is it because of our service or our attitude, or some other reasons? But be it any of them, we still have to CHANGE. Yes, change. First, we have to learn to be more considerate. Tone down the volume of your music or television at night so that we will not disturb others. Secondly, we have to be more friendly and humble and not boast about everything. And lastly, we have to be nice to others before you get it in return. For example, we can give them a good impression when we show good attitudes and show them respect. <br /></p><br /><p><u><b>GOOD VOCABULARY:</b></u><br /><br />disdain<br />outset<br />pigswill</p>"

"event","<font color=""#ff0066"">From last Friday till Monday, I have been away from Singapore, yeah, I went to <u><b>MALAYSIA</b></u>! :D We arrived at around afternoon on Friday and my cousin's family and my family went to eat lunch at a nearby noodle stall. I ordered some food and we indulged in our delicious food. After that we went to my cousin's house to wait for my cousin to come back from work before we go for dinner at Tangkak with another cousin's family. Soon it was 7.00pm when everyone got ready and everyone went to the restaurant at Tangkak to eat. We ordered a lot of mouth watering dishes and ate and talk at the same time. I played with my little cousin while my brother chased another cousin round and round the restaurant. The adults drank beer even though they had to drive home. I told my dad to not drink so much and he agreed. But in the end he drank 3 glasses of Carlsberg. WOAH, so much for the okay. After that, we went home. Luckily he was not drunk. HHAS. We reached home at around 11pm and we went to shower and we watched midnight MOVIES!! :D at around midnight, I could not keep my eyes awake anymore, so I decided to sleep. NEXT DAY WAS SUPER FUN!! (: We went to attend my cousin's birthday party. He turned SIX!! ((: He is super cute with super BIG eyes, but SUPER IRRITATING. I can understand since he is only six, hahas. It was kinda dead as I did not know a lot of people so I just kept to playing with the little kids who were friendly to get along and also, my cousins (; Thank goodness I had my primary 6 cousin's company. Oh and my brother too! :D Feeling super bored, we went to the shop nearby to buy some balloons and played outside the school compound near my cousin's house. As the door was not locked and we had a basketball borrowed from my six year old cousin's cousin, we played basketball for a while. Which was FUN! The adults talked at the coffee table outside the house. Soon we stopped playing and we went inside the house to watch a horror movie! It was not exactly scary but at least we had something to do. When the show ended, my mom said it was time for us to go home. Sigh, so early. It was only ten plus. But judging that we had to take 1 hour plus to go home, I agreed. True enough when we went home, it was midnight. Normal routine, I showered, read some comics and then went to bed. Continue about the trip next time (: BYEBYE! :D</font>"

I will get people to kill you and attend funeral'.</p>  <p>He said this during a class at his school in Jurong West last Aug 17.</p>  <p><script type=""text/javascript"" language=""JavaScript"" src=""http://news.asiaone.com/static/ads/scripts/adsimu.js""></script></p><div id=""imu11""><br /></div>A Community Court heard that Mr Chin was invigilating the class when Neo made a lot of noise. When asked to leave, Neo uttered the words in Mandarin before leaving the classroom.  <p>The teacher felt alarmed and made a police report. Under the order, Neo will have to observe curfew between 9pm and 6am and do 60 hours of community service.</p>  <p>His father, who is divorced and now has another family, signed a $4,000 bond to ensure his good behaviour.</p><b><u><br />REFLECTIONS:</u></b><br /><br />I think that the boy should not threaten the teacher in such a manner, as we always say, we must always respect the elders. It was quite serious that he threatened the teacher in this way that the teacher had to inform the police about it. This might be due to his family problems as well. So, we cannot totally blame him for those things that have taken place. Well, what his father could do is maybe pay more attention to him. Well, he can exercise some self control too. Before he wants to scold the teacher, count to ten and relax. This will enable him to control of himself and not get into trouble. By practicing this, I think that most of the troubles would be saved. I hope that he would learn from his mistakes and not repeat it again. <br /><br /><u><b><br /></b></u>"

"event","You may be asking how come I had this random talk about the Boys Brigade Headquarters. Well, its mainly because the sec2 council camp is help there. Its a 2 day 1 night camp, from 23 may to 24 may. And having know that its held at the BB HQ, I decided to ask some of the BB guys in our school about that place. And finally, I gathered that the place was old and dirty, in a sense that it is not cleaned up. True enough when we went there, the place look kind of old to me. Wonder how long has the place be there. While we were there, our dear classmates were still studying, or rather listening to forums. So, we sort of escaped lessons as we left school at around 8.15am. The whole day, we were at Fraser Hall, listening to workshops, which were kind of dry, but obviously there are some fun parts that we enjoyed ourselves as well! Our lunch was as 12.30pm. And after lunch, we were super <u><b>HYPER!</b></u> We played, take pictures and did lots of funny stuff. Before the coaches started their workshop, Coach Ernest played with us the pass the parcel game. The parcel was the stress ball and Coach Ernest on his music from the laptop and the game was played. The guys behind wanted to sabotage each other, so they decided to hold on the ball for a longer period of time, and when the music stops, they would pass the ball to the person beside them, letting them suffer the forfeit. The forfeits was actually to say a council cheer, which involves everyone and we have to score a point of 8/10 for the cheer or else the forfeiter will have to stand for the whole of the next session. I liked the last cheer the most, the cheerleaders were supposed to create a cheer that expresses Coach Danielle's CUTENESS :D It was so funny. After that, we went back to the workshop about Project Management. I learned that in order to carry out our project successfully, we had to Plan, Implement, Monitor and Evaluate, otherwise known as P.I.M.E (: When the workshop was about to end, we had the egg parachute competition. We had to make a parachute using the materials that we 'buy' to build a parachute which allows the egg to remain proper, means no cracks should be seen. In the end, each group had successfully made the parachutes, which was then tested out. GOOD NEWS! Everyone's egg survived! ((: Good job people! Then, it was dinner time! We had catering for dinner again. I did not have much appetite, don't know why. So, I ate like three quarter of the food and threw the rest. I know, I know, its wasteful. But, I cannot eat anymore, sorry. The sad part came. Evelyn, Cherie, Jane and I had to leave as we had IP math and english aptitude test the next day, while Evelyn has to go to Canada the next day too! I will miss her ): The night activities were fun, I heard. They played games and the best was at night. It was scary, the whole place was old, plus the girls were freaked out as Eleanore found some freaky magazine under her bed which showed a scary face. But they soon forgot about it. They stayed up late at night and at 12am exactly, they hugged Simin as it was her birthday on 24 may! They were still walking around the aisle at 11.45pm, WOW, I am so jealous :x How I wished I could stay. Blame it on the test ): Never mind. I did not really know what they did on 24 may so I shall end here! : DD BYEBYE! Enjoy your holidays(:"

And tomorrow is <b><u>CHINESE</u></b>, no its<u><b> </b></u>HIGHER Chinese for me, super saddening as the paper is super HARD. So, there is kind of nothing to study since those that the teacher teaches will not come out. But those who take express Chinese have to study the words I think. And I screwed up almost every subject of my exams, OH NO! ): I hope I don't get bad results. Plus, I cannot believe that I walked from the KFC near our school to the all the way to the bus stop outside Clearwater. <b>ACHIEVEMENT: I HAVE SAVED ONE BUS FARE!</b> :DDD Great! I feel so accomplished today, though I kind of screwed up my Science paper. I think I am going to do the same tomorrow, I think its so so so FUN! Though its a little tiring, but its not so bad after all, since the weather was not that hot. I got to go, need to do some practices fro Chinese. MAYBE it will help. Okay, so I guess its BYEBYE! :D"

Why does the Math paper 1 and 2 fall on different dates- I prefer to take them together on the same day, save time(: Though the time for both paper would be long, but who cares, I am totally fine with it because MATH ROCKS(: But the sad thing is here.

I was sneezing and sneezing last night till I cannot really sleep. This morning I was sneezing too. Same goes for the evening as well. AHHH! Luckily, its just the flu, not fever. I shall be a good girl and drink more water to prevent the flu to worsen. HAHAS. I don't want to be sick during exams since its the mid years. Hoping against hopes that I will do well for Mid Years so that I can get into a good class and get into the course that I want next year too!

"event","TODAY, TODAY, TODAY! Today was a super great day! :D After school, straight after DnT, Simin, Yishin, Evelyn, Angelica, Darren, Wey Jieh, Jeremy, Alphonse, Joel and I went to the prata shop near the school. It was like full house when we went there, but the nice uncle was so nice to get us a seat!(: We soon settled down and ordered our food, it arrived five minutes after, fast! I ate the fastest. While we were eating, poor Jeremy went to the bubbletea shop nearby with WeyJieh as he could not eat anything because of sore throat. Blame the bacteria D: After I finished eating, I asked Evelyn to accompany me to the bubbletea shop so I could buy a drink, and i bought chocolate ice-blend-NICE! (: IM CONTENTED with it. When we went back to the prata shop, I got the worst shock of my life! They were having sort of a pearl fight.. Then, I decided to go back to school, the others followed On the way, they shot pearls as well but soon, they FINALLY stopped. FINALLY! Therefore, the journey back to school was quite peaceful. In school, we went to the library. I went down soon to the study corner to do my math homework with Hui Xuan. When I finished, I went to the library to look for Evelyn, Simin, Jeremy and Darren, prepared to go home. However, Evelyn was not there, so we waited for her return. Meanwhile, we used the computer in the library. Jeremy kept disturbing Simin by anyhow typing on the keyboard till Simin had to turn her keyboard away. It was super funny! :D When Evelyn returned, we went to the bus stop together. Alas, when we went to the bus stop, Evelyn received an sms from the supplier of our class tee shirt that he was sending the sample to the school now. Thus, we went back to school from the bus stop. There was only me, Simin, Evelyn and Darren left. We went to wait for the supplier in the canteen. After we waited for about 45min, the supplier told us to not wait for him and that he would pass the sample to Ms Kristy Tan. We were kind of angry as we wanted to get the sample by today, but its okay, we still went home eventually. It was quite late by then &gt;&lt; Anyway, TODAY was a fun day. I thank God for today. -THE END- (:"

"event","Today, I was supposed to help out in the sec 4 and 5s in their NAPHA test but because of chapel plus its briefing for councillors, I was late): And Mr Lian did not mark my attendance, and so I told him that I was present. He told me that my station did not need any help and he assigned me to the sit ups station. Therefore, I ran up to the sit up stations which was in the hall. But I thought they did not need so many people after all as there was so little people there and that there are about seven helpers, including Hui Xuan, there already. Thus, Hui Xuan and I decided to go to the library to study science since we were not of much help anyway. But when we got to the library, the teachers were having meeting and we did not know, so we went in. Alas, we saw people wearing high heel shoes instead of normal white shoes. When we looked up, we saw projectors. We hurried to close the door so as to not disrupt the meeting. Next, we wanted to go to the council room- but NO KEY! So, we ended up going to the canteen to look for people to talk to. Then, we saw Tabitha and Andre sitting with the Ben, the guitar player for chapel, and we went to talk to them- they were so friendly! :D We talked and talked and talked until I saw Evelyn, Jeremy, Eugene and Darren walk out of the drop in centre. Of course I went to talk to them(: Eugene treated me black current drink and we all sat down to drink. I sat on the same chair as Jeremy while Darren was seating on the chair beside us in the canteen. Evelyn and Eugene was standing. Suddenly, Jeremy started to rock the chair. I told him that we would fall but he did not listen to my advice. True enough, I fell down down together with him! Mind you, I was drinking. And the drink spilled a little on Jeremy's leg- he got it cleaned eventually. After that, they all went home. After staying one hour more in school, I went home as it was rather late already. It was a super super super fun day! xD"

It took us about&nbsp;one&nbsp;hour to get to the HTA located&nbsp;quite far&nbsp;away from our school.&nbsp;Once we reached there, we had to wait for the NPCC cadets from Siglap Secondary School to finish&nbsp;taking their measurements&nbsp;before its our turn. When they finished, we had to line up according to our gender, boys and girls. And when we formed two rows of&nbsp;boyds and girls,&nbsp;with the girls in front and guys at the back., we had to stand from the tall to the tallest. Obviously, I was standing at the left hand side as I was one of the shortest(: HAHA. Soon, we got inside trhe room with the uniforms. Firstly, I tried out the white uniform. It was rather nice. Then, they gave me the pants for me to check. Once I said it was okay, they issued me the head dress. It looks quite funny, but we had no choice but to wear it, its too good an opportunity to waste. When everyone was done with talking of new uniform, we went back to school with bus again. The bus had to go halfway through the journey and we had to change bus at some stadium near the HTA. While waiting for the bus to arrive, Mr Yeoh gave out our rank, buttons, glove, crest and collar pins for our uniform. When he finished giving out, the bus arrived and we boarded the bus. It took us another one hour to travel back to school, we reached school at about 6.30pm. I went home immediately after."

It was worth watching. Our school band played most of the songs and about only four songs were played by the St Hilda's Alumni. I liked the emcees of the concert- they were super professional. It was totally from those who are from our school. They put the introduction in a way that it makes the audience want to give them the attention. Anyway, going back to the concert. I felt that the concert was quite all right, no screw ups anywhere. Even if they were, they were not obvious(: Good thing. I found that the song Mission Impossible was the nicest and the most special. The band members put on sunglasses and had a style to play- impressive. There was a twenty minutes interval and so, I decided to bring the tidbits that I bought in. But, the usher told me no food and drinks were allowed. I was like okay and I finished the tidbits outside. And Evelyn wanted to finish her coke within that short period of time. But in the end she put her bottle in Joel's bag- YEAH. She successfully smuggled it in. HAHA. It was 10 plus at the end of the concert and I was dead tired. My eyes are almost closing but I still had to go home): We walked to the Tanjong Pagar MRT station and there, we had to pass by&nbsp; a short tunnel, which was super deserted. Yishin started to scream and Joel joined in the 'fun'. Soon, Evelyn and Simin screamed as well. WEIRD people. We ended up going seperate ways. We had an enjoyable but super tiring night.&nbsp;"

After attire check and taking the water mist gun, our training started under the scorching heat. Because of dragging our boots and leaving gaps when we walked in twos into the parade square, we were being punished by our Sergeant. You will never guess what we did.. We did what we NCDCC cadets called hot earth. Hot earth was something like staying in push up position under the hot sun on the tar road. And so, we did 10 push ups. My hand was burnt, putting it on the hot tar road. Luckily, it was not for long. We then started training with our water mist guns., doing certain foot drills. We rehearsed the whole event once or twice and did some practice on ourselves. I was dehydrated from those trainings. How I wished it could rain, but luckily, towards the end, the sun was not so hot. This was when it turned a bit windy- YEAPYY!:D So happy.

In order for it to work, it has to be plugged into the&nbsp;fire hydrant for the water to come out of the jet. And the water pressure would be to high for shooting. These should be the reasons why we cannot use it, I guess. If u want to take a look at the water mist gun, you could come in to take a look on our weekly training so you can get the whole picture of how it is like."

"event","You must be wondering whats a water mist gun and how it looks like right? So, to answer your little and simple question here. I have attatched a link at the bottom for more information:<br />http://www.made-in-china.com/showroom/rayscx/product-detailqaLmUkprRxPj/China-Fire-Extinguisher-Impulse-Water-Mist-Gun-SI09-01-.html<br /><br />YEAH! TA-DAA! This is the link. HAHA. The water mist gun is a fire fighting equipment. Its otherwise known as WMG, its short form. So why do you think I am writing about it out of the blue? Obviously its because of some reasons. HAHA. Yes, because we, guard-of-honours members of NCDCC have to carry a water mist gun while marching during Founder's Day somewhere in April. By then, we would be standing and marching proudly with our uniforms and water mist gun-wonder how we would look.. Currently, the mist gun is almost as tall as me, slightly above my neck (oh no! I am so SHORT!:D). But its okay, I do not mind. Its heavy too, once you carry it for too long, your arms would have muscle cramp and when you move it, it would be super pain. Looking forward for the water mist gun to arrive on Thursday, so I can maybe show you and most importantly, PRACTISE WITH IT! As people say, practise makes perfect :D<br /><br /><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME~1/PACKAR~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg"" alt="""" /><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME~1/PACKAR~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.jpg"" alt="""" /><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME~1/PACKAR~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-2.jpg"" alt="""" /><img src=""file:///C:/DOCUME~1/PACKAR~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot-3.jpg"" alt="""" />"

Thus, missing the workshop would be a counted as a great loss to us. Gotta go now, BYEBYE [:"

"event","Sorry Mrs Toh that I posted things that hurt you on lifejournal. It seriously meant no harm when I was writing it, I was rather expressing my thoughts but however, I am really sorry that I hurt you in one form or another. From this incident, I learnt alot of lessons valuable to life. Firstly, being careful and mindful about what you say or do. Because, if you are not, watch out for the consequences- it might be really harsh you know. Secondly, do not jump to consequences if you did not make the facts right. People might get hurt about what you said and others might get the wrong impression on the person you 'insulted'. Its sort of unfair to the person right? I mean, being accused by something which you actually did not do. So think twice before you act. Lastly, say or ask things in a nice manner and not through an argumentative way. In this way, you would not get into a fight easily and also, people would treat you nicely in return. Thats all I want to say for this post[: Sorry and byebye!!"

"event","This week, is also known as the common test week. On Monday and Tuesday, we had our Literature, Chinese, Science, Mathematics, English and Geography tests. The subject I feared most was my geography as I was weak in it. That was part of the reason why I kept studying geography on Sunday. I was afraid that I could not memorise what I was supposed to know. As for literature, I was a bit not confident about it. The topic tested was on Act One of Emily of Emerald Hill. Although I read it&nbsp; three to four times already, I still could not get it inside my head! I was paranoid. But luckily, the abstract that was tested was not really related to the book. PHEWWW![: Chinese was another problem. The cloze passage tested was difficult. Most of the words that were tested were those which I did not hear of before! Luckily, I still got 36/50, 41/50 being the highest score in the class. Science was quite simple and I did not have much problem except for the graph plotting and drawing on the last page. And finally, Mathematics.. It was quite easy as well but to me, the easier the paper, the more careless mistakes you would make. Lastly, English. English was not really as much of a problem. But the vocabulary part was kind of difficult for me. Hope I did well for English though. And of course for all my other subjects! Will continue to work hard for the upcoming mid-year examinations{:"

"event","Last Sunday, I went to East Coast, Red House, to eat with my friends and family. We actually planned to go to Jumbo to eat but because there were too many people , we had to go to Red House. We ordered three Sri Lanka crabs, kangkong, tofu,&nbsp;  youtiao, cereal prawn and many more delicious seafood. WOW! It took the food half an hour or so to arrive. I ate almost every dish and one bowl of rice. It was just nice. I liked the black pepper crabs and youtiao. Although it was not as nice as those in Jumbo but it was still acceptable. After eating, my brother and my friends and of course including me, went to the sand area to play[: We made some model of people on the sand and it was high tide. So, whatever we made was being washed away after a while. Everytime our master piece was being washed away, we rebuilt it. It was cool and breezy there. If only it could be my house:x But I know its impossible. My friend also told me that last time when she went to toilet in Red House, she got stuck inside. She banged on the door but no one could hear her as there was a sound of a motor fan at the back. Luckily she got her handphone with her so she called her mom and the chefs went to help her open the door. WOAH! Such a funny encounter with the toilet. When we went home, it was about 11pm when I reached home and showered. Wish that I could go there again.. If only yht next day wasn't common test, we could have stayed later))))):"

"event","On Wednesday, which was the second day that i spent at my grandmother's house in Malacca (Malaysia), I saw a little snake near the tap outside my grandmother's house. At that time, I was refilling the pail for washing the floor. While refilling, I saw something gliding. I was taken aback, wondering if it was a snake. Curiosity got the better of me and&nbsp; I decided to take a better look&nbsp; and bent my body forward to confirm my thoughts. And true enough, right there in between the stones was a little snake, about 10cm long, gliding! I was horrified and told my brother and my aunt who was beside me. My aunt then told my brother to use the stick of the broom to kill it but it was to no avail. I then thought of an idea-HOT WATER! I quickly asked my brother to grab some from the kitchen and within seconds, he poured the hot water on the snake. It overturned and was struggling. I then told my uncle about the snake and he dug a hole in the sand and buried the snake inside. PHEWW! Such a close encounter. I was terrified at the sight of the snake as it was the first time I saw a real snake in my entire life! I hope this would certainly be the first and last time I will ever have an encounter with a snake.. Snakes are FREAKY and worst still-it scares me:x"

"event","<p>Today, we had our yearly crosscountry at Bedok Reservoir Park . It was extremely tiring, but enjoyable though.&nbsp;We had to report to the area near the playground at 7.30 am to assemble. After which, is the short briefing by our new PE HOD, Mr Lian (however way it is spelled) and a short opening message from our principal, Mr Ong. Soon,&nbsp;it was time for the sec2 competive boys to run. We cheered them on and then they did their warm-ups and left. Following them, is the sec1 competitive boys and then, sec2 competive girls. Forthly, it was the sec2 non-competitive boys. Fifth was sec1 non-competive boys, sixth was sec2 non-competitive girls and lastly, sec1 non-competitive girls. I was in the sec2 competitive girls team. The other 4 participants in my team are Cherie, Lynn, Yi Shin and Joey. Through&nbsp;most of the&nbsp;journey, I had stitch. ARGHHHH! Because of that, I was dropped to the 2nd position then 4th then 5th...I walked and jogged throughout the whole journey of 4.3km. It was very difficult to run for the stitch was very very painful. I was running and thinking at the same time, am I reaching the finishing line soon? I was already very tired by the time I reached the 3.0km marking. But something told me to keep running. So, in the end, I was the 22nd. TWO more positions to help the class win points and for me to get a trophie!! I&nbsp;missed my chance. If only I had ran and sprinted through the whole of the last 1km. But its already too late. Crosscountry is over and I got to accept the fact that I did not do my best. Currently having a muscle ache. NAPHA is coming up soon, must train hard to get a gold and this time a gold without regret..</p>"

"event","<font size=""2"">Someday this week, Mrs Toh asked us to stay back to help Eunice&nbsp;wrap our tables with the wrapping papers that she bought and then after which,cover the tables with&nbsp;a plastic sheet.It was to make the class colourful as some of our classmates said that the classroom need to be more colourful in order to create a better learning environment for us to study in.At first,I had some objections to this thinking but soon I started to get used to it as we got to slot some motivational statements and things like that.Thats sounds quite like&nbsp;a good idea to me(: But I find some of the wrapping papers quite funny.For&nbsp;instance my row.Our wrapping papers were the pictures od wedding bells.I find it quite odd though.It doesn't really suit us.But plus the motivational statements that we are printing out,it should be just nice.Maybe we should do more decorations in our classroom to make it look lively and just nice for us to study in it.That should be about it.Write to you about more issues next week!Byeeeee... ...</font>"

"event","HELLO!Back again to post another entry(:Last Friday,I went for my year-end council camp!It was a 26h(2D 1N) camp,which means we were not allowed to sleep.YEAH!We had to assemble&nbsp;outside the creativity hall at 8.00am according to our sub council.When everyone arrived,our seniors took our attendance for us.We were then seperated into eight different groups(A,B,C,D,E,F,G and H).I was in group H,also known as HOTCAKES!:D My group members were Sze-Ern,Melissa,Joseph,Jeremy,Eunice,Vanessa and Fikril.There were three group leaders from the St Andrew JC(SAJC) sports club assisting us too.They are Zi Sheng,Genevieve and another one,whose name&nbsp;I have forgotten:x oopsie.This grouping thing was actually for our amazing race!We were required to go around Singapore,either by bus or MRT or walking,to cover the trail that the SAJC people had planned.But,of course we had to plan our own trail.There were several choices for us to choose.My group chose this route: First stop,Bugis.Second stop,Cityhall linkway.Third stop,Istana Park.Fourth stop,Plaza Singapura.Fifth stop,Vivo City and then it was back to school.(I think the sequence is correct)At each stations,we had to do a quest.The one that I remembered most vividly,was the Find-me station at City Hall.Our quest was to find a person,only given the side view of him.The 1st clue was that the person is in odd level floors,starting from B1.We searched B1 first.When we were about to go up,we saw this person smiling at our group leaders.We found it a bit weird and so matched the side view of him.And true enough,we found him!((:After that,he asked us to buy something one dollar or less for him.In less than five minutes,we bought a packet of earsticks which costs one dollar for him.Mission accomplished!:D As for the other stations,we completed the quests too.Through this amazing race,I knew many more other fellow councillors and&nbsp;most importantly,teamwork.We also came&nbsp;up with a group cheer!The amazing race ended at about 5plus.Next,it was prize presentation(we came&nbsp;in third) and then it was dinner.After the fantastic&nbsp;dinner,it was bathing time .We were not supposed to go to the old block to bathe,so we stayed at the ground floor.The worst thing was that the shower hose was spoiled and there was no pail too.In the end,we didn't shower.When showering time was over,we had a talk about the school core values and then various sub councils head and vice-head are to come out with next year's budget and schedule.This went on and on until the 6am the next day.It was soon breakfast time.As it was raining,we didn't have our morning PT.This brought forward the dimissal time.We were realeased at around 8.00am instead of 10.00am.Two hours earlier!HAHA.Home sweet home FINALLY(:"

"event","HELLO once again!Last week,on tuesday,I had my first year end NCDCC chalet held at Aloha Loyang in Pasir Ris.When I first reached there,I was amazed by the cleaniness of the chalet as I thought most of the chalets would be dirty.On the first day of the chalet,it was more relaxed.The first item was briefing by the chairperson.Followed was a game called wacko.After wacko we played stinger which involves integrity.The game goes like this.Two stingers would be appointed among the participants without the other participants knowing and these stingers have to go around shaking hands and then pressing people on their palms.Other participants would only go around shaking hands.Once you are stung by the stinger,you would die after 10 seconds.At any time of the game,you can accuse anyone of being stinger.If your accusation is correct,then the stinger will die.But,if your accusation is wrong,then you will die.Then,the next game is evolution.Until about 6 plus to 7 plus at night was free and easy.Groups had to prepare for their talent time.After eating dinner,it was police and thief.Pupils have to run around the chalet from one station to another without being caught.If you are caught,you have to go to the forfeit station for some forfeits.After everyone was safely back at the chalet,it was time for the station masters to play police and thief!(I was one of the station masters)Our game was different.We had to go around in groups and then from the open field,we had to run back to the chalet without being caught.Our group was caught two times.But luckily when we were discovered the third time,we ran all the way back to the chalet.The catchers were tired after chasing after us for a while and soon lagged behind.In the end,we went back to the chalet safely.YEAH!That day,I slept at 3am when lights out supposed to be at 11pm:x The second day was more of running around.We had morning PT in the rain and then there was puzzle hunt.Participants were grouped and they have to go around the chalet,looking for pictures they were given.They had to write down the location of where&nbsp;the pictures were when they found it.Next,was scavenger hunt.It was a game filled with obstacles.Groups had to earn their lunch through that game too,given a budget.They&nbsp;had to run out of the chalet to get their quests done in order to earn points.The pount of this game was only to have fun(:Other than that,we had BBQ at night,together with talent time.The skits the groups put up were&nbsp;interesting and some,cool!:D HAHA.At around 10pm,we had night walk at Pasir Ris park,which was a distance away from the chalet.The sec2s had to walk individually and the sec1s had to walk two by two.I paired up withSimin.Each station masters scared us.But luckily,we were the last pair and so only were scared once(:PHEW.In a blink of an eye,it was already the third day.Nothing much happen on that day other than reflections and prize presentation.At around 11plus,most of us went home,exhausted.Ex-co members and camp commitee members had the priviledge to stay one more day in the chalet."

"event","<font size=""2"">Hello(:In a blink of an eye,sec1 has passed,filled with beautiful memories and that means-HOLIDAYS!but..there is still homework.Sad.But anyway this is one of the activities that I do during the holidays- play sports!It keeps you healthy and at least you wont be bored to death stuck at home doing nothing!It was a Saturday on that day and so my friends and I decided to use our time fruitfully by playing badminton at a nearby badminton court near Bedok swimming complex.It was very fun and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.I won my friends for several matches when playing badminton.YEAH!Before we left,we went to the isolated toilet there&nbsp;to wipe our&nbsp;sweat.One of my friends saw a coakcroach and began to scream.'Being a 13-year-old,you are&nbsp;still scared of coakcroaches?'I thought.So,I just told her to go out of the toilet quick after wiping her sweat&nbsp;if she was that scared.And she did what I told her to.I was left with my other friend,laughing at her.Her expressions when she saw the coakcroaches were super funny and one of a kind.Until we went out,we still cant help but laugh at her.HAHA.After which,we went home,feeling all wore out and exhausted.</font>"

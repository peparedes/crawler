"event","Congratulations to Condoleeza Rice who will be the next secretary of state. In an administration dominated by yes men it's nice to see a yes woman finally get somewhere. And of course black women across the nation should look up to her. She's replacing the other token black who let himself be used by the Bush administration, bet he's having trouble looking in the mirror these days.

Watched the acceptance speech. It was hard to understand what she was saying with George's dick so far down her throat. God, at least Clinton had the decency to get his bojos behind closed doors.

"event","just got back from Florida. That state is at war with itself.

Spent the days volunteering with the ""leave no voter behind"" program and the nights drinking in a Gibtown bar. Unfortunately the carnival folk who live in Gibtown did not come out. I guess halloween is every night for them.

Florida is complete chaos. 

On the last day, Michael Moore came to our headquarters to help recruit more volunteers. A bunch of republicans showed up with signs. We were all so passive and nonviolent and the republicans were mad as hell. A couple guys actually threatened my life!

I think that right there is the key to how republicans win. We liberals just need to get mean.

But then again they have reason to be mad, their leader is about to get the boot. We don't need to be mad, things are going our way.

Met a lot of people. Same amount of Kerry supporters as Bush. What really disappointed me was the no shows and believe it or not, undecideds. One lady told me she and her husband weren't going to decide untill they got to the polls. What's going to happen at the polls that hasn't happened for you in the last 5 months? You going to play eeeny meenny miny mo? Or are you going to wait till the media tells you who's winning so you can be a winner too? This isn't like betting on a horse you dumb bitch.

It's neck and neck but I believe Kerry will take Florida and America.

The republicans have already started cheating.

When I was out canvassing, the people who opened the door a crack and left the latch up, or didn't even open the door just yelled ""who is it?"" Or anyone who was rude before I even said a word, those were the bush supporters. They must sleep with guns under their pillows.

But then again the Kerry people are scared too. It was very strange but they wouldn't tell you who they were voting to untill you told them you were on kerry's side and then they felt reassured and opened up. I think there is some very intense voter intimidation going on behind the scenes that exceed any of our fears.

Tomorrow we will hear the words ""president Kerry""

there are simply too many pissed liberals, too many new voters, too many young people, and too many volunteers reaching out to all of the above for this to go wrong.

If Bush wins, it's because he's cheated (already evidence of this in florida, missing ballots, e voting scandal) and if he's cheated, all hell is about to break loose..."

"event","Had lunch with Curtis Harrington on Sunday. He was wearing a black and white Richard Sera painting T shirt of one of the abu ghraib atrocities with the words ""stop bush"". Curtis is 76 years old, I asked him if this was the most important election he'd ever seen, he said by far. He said nixon and reagan were shits but this election is crucial.

He also said he's dropped all his republican friends. I'm beginning to agree with him. One's politics are so indicitive of their personality, more specifically- republicans tend to be selfish. Anyway, no one wants to argue with friends so they either don't talk politics or get rid of the friend. I'm thinking of doing the latter in a couple instances.

Also, I read a lot of personals ads, and a lot of people write ""must be liberal"" or ""no bush supporters please"" They don't just write that for seeking long term relationships ads, they write thatfor casual encounter ads!

You know the country's polarized when the thought that the person you're going to fuck is of the opposite political opinion turns you off.

Me personally I'd love to shag a republican. I'd like to tie Ann Coulter up and teach her a lesson or give Nancy Reagan the first orgasm of her life.

I'd also really like to sexually humiliate W. I'd love to have a picture of me pointing at his cock and giving the thumbs up.

"event","Watched the beheading videos last night. Before I'm accused of being a morbid asshole I'd like to remind you that what I saw was a direct result of the decisions made our elected leader. I think every American should see these videos. Just as every meat eater should tour a slaughterhouse and every death penalty advocate should smell the soiled underwear and burnt flesh while they watch a convict die.

American's don't want to know where their food comes from and they don't want to know the realities of the wars they advocate. Sure we see it on TV, CNN shows some combat, but the whole idea of Iraq seems so distant and abstract to us. No one knows what's real...

It was the most horrifying thing I've ever seen. 

Kenneth Bigley, the british hostage, managed to die with such dignity, again he address Tony Blair personally (that Blair can sleep at night is a monstrous miracle) ""So here I am again Mr. Blair and  your government very very close to the end of my life, you don't appear to have done anything to help me. I'm not a difficult person, I'm a simple man who just wants to live a simple life with his family.""  But knowing that he's going to die soon, he still pleas for the insurgents demands. And what are the demands? Not withdraw your the troops of Britain or America, nothing like that, just let the women of Abu Ghraib prison free. He even seems to show sympathy for his murderers, ""These people, their patience is wearing very very thin, and they're very serious people. Please please give them what they require, the freedom of the women from abu ghraib prison, I beg you. If you do this, the problem is solved."" He pleads to the British people to take to the streets. ""I can't say a great deal more, I've said so many things to you. I've said so many things to you at so many times. All I can tell you is I have a very very short time left.""

Then the young man behind him hacks his fucking head off with a machete.

One man, I believe a turkish hostage... You can hear his body gasping for air out of the hole in his neck as they hack and hack. Beheading a man isn't as quick and easy as it looks in the stupid Hollywood action movies we pay good money to wallow in.

I also watched the video of the latest prisoner pleading for help, this time a woman with Iraqi British citizenship. I suppose next week the grizzly sequel will be released.

If anyone has the balls to take a painful look at one of the many consequences of our war, you can find all the videos on this cheap sleazy website-

http://www.ogrish.com/index2.htm

It's our inability to comprehend death that causes us to make and flock to stupid violent movies like Kill Bill. It makes it pocket sized with it's glossy coolness.

"event","I'm so sick of matt parker and trey stone. I can't stand bad satire. Remember when satire meant you had you had a view point, or at least you were critiquing a specific view point? These guys' only stance is to make fun of anyone who take serious issues seriously.

To say there's no shame in voting if you don't know the issues is a dangerous thing these days. American youth does not need any more encouragement in it's nihilism.

It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to not get involved. It takes guts to take a stand. I agree that actors are to some extent puppets and often voice political opinions to compensate for this lack of importance in the grand scheme. But Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Susan Sarandon are braver than Stone and Parker could ever be. Those two are cowards, they take the easy way out. They'll do anything for a laugh, they're incapable of getting laughs that matter, they crave cheap laughs, not laughs that make anyone think about anything.

A satire is social critique but these dimwits just use important issues like terrorism and war as fodder for their lazy cynicism and lack of any integrity whatsoever. They think they're being cutting edge by making fun of important figures, but  they lack the intellectual curiosity to examine their own subject matter. They epitomize everything I hate about america; complacency, sensationalism, cowardice, and a blatant disregard for anything more than mediocrity.

They're like someone who would go along with anything, war, holocaust, you name it so long as they were allowed to drown themselves in sarcasm the whole way simply because it's the cool thing to do and the easy thing to do.

They're like a throw back to the slaxploitation of the early nineties. It wasn't interesting then and it's certainly not now when the fate of the world could come down to a few ballots on November 2nd.

"event","I've got another job lined up despite my being a half hour late for the interview. I've grown so careless towards work that I feel I'm being unfair to these people who give a shit. I've been running around all week. If I ever write a piece about Fassbinder I'm going to call it ""Sleep when you're dead, die when you sleep."" It somes up 

Wed. night- Curtis Harrington screens his latest film Usher, I meet Ebbie and John Gilmore there. John's very nice. He tells me a french company wants to make a film of his book about his days with James Dean.  He talks about his struggling actor period in New York, ""Fame didn't come easy for me like it did for Jimmy Dean, but I outlived him by a few years."" 49 years to be exact. He looks good, he's in great shape. He's very fatherly towards Ebbie. It's cute.

The movie is a lot of fun. Curtis stars in it. He's a very interesting onscreen presence. The film is obviously very personal, a labor of love. Curtis appears in drag and I must say he looks very good in a wig and makeup.  There's a wonderful masked dinner party scene. Very creepy revolving shots of the masked guests, one of them is a beautiful lesbian played by Anton Lavey's daughter Zeena. He's very insistant on certain images, you're allowed to really soak them up. Gary Graver shot it, famous for shooting Orson Welles' later work and some of John Cassavetes' stuff. I hope Curtis gets the money to make another Poe film.

Afterwards at the Q and A, a familiar voice pipes up behind me. It's Kenneth Anger. He launches into a big speech about his troubled relationship with Curtis. Afterwards we say hi to Curtis. Meanwhile Mr. Anger, who is now Dr. Anger, has unbuttoned his shirt to exhibit his Lucifer chest tattoo for some of the audience members. 

I'm dying to ask this hero of my youth for an interview, so I lurk nearby untill he has some free attention. I introduce myself. He immediately tells me to copyright the name of my magazine. He starts talking a mile a minute about halloween and the fourth of July and suddenly I realize we're alone in the theater. Very weird moment. He keeps talking to me as we walk out of the theater, there's a young man waiting for him. Kenneth asks him if I can come with them. The next thing I know I'm in this young man's car sitting behind Kenneth Anger (in between the theater and the car he shows his chest tattoo to two passerbys)

We go to Curtis's tribute party at a bar on vine. I cannot turn down free drinks. When Kenneth is in the bathroom I ask the young man how he knows Kenneth. He says he doesn't really, he was just sitting next to him during the screening and Anger asked him for a ride to the party. Classic. 

I've met Kenneth Anger briefly on two occassions previously. Once when he received an award at the art institute and once when he was presented with another award at the Castro theater. At the Art Institute he was not in good spirits. He seemed very agitated and lashed out at the projectionist. Outside he had a table of videos for sale. I bought one, he forgot selling it to me when I asked him to sign it. It was pretty intimidated to be accused of stealing by Kenneth Anger, but eventually he believed me and signed it. At the Castro he was in much better spirits, told all the old stories.

So I mentioned the Castro to him and he started talking about old theaters and what a shame it is that San Francisco has demolished all its own theaters. He said the fox plaza office building that I lived across from used to be a wonderful old theater with a wurlitzer. He said when they tore it down he put a curse on it and since then every business in the building has gone under. I start laughing and he asks me why- ""That explains so much, once years ago I spent the night with a woman in her apartment high above the office suites and the sex was terrible, it must have been the curse.""

Kenneth asks me how old I am. I say 24. He says, ""You'd better be careful, that's the age James Dean died."" I hate to be reminded of people who accomplished more than I have and in less time. It's depressing.

We chat for about a half hour at the bar. The young man who drove us has to leave so I offer to drive Kenneth home.  I don't even get a chance to say hello to Curtis as he's surrounded by people the whole night. John Gilmore said the voo doo doll I gave him really freaked him out. I think that coupled with my answering machine message has left me with a lot of explaining to do.

Kenneth and I walk back to the theater to get my car. He talks all about Fritz Lang. I take him back to his place in Silver Lake and he invites me in. I'm thrilled. He asks if I'm a night person and I say yes, he is too so we talk all night and he even shows me some rough footage from the projects he's working on.  He has an impressive video collection of obscure foreign films that he promises to turn me on to. He shows me how to conjure Lucifer. He runs the entire gammit of emotions during the night at one point verging on tears as he talks about a close friend.  I've heard a lot of stories about him but I tell you he is a sweet man with a kind soul, very tender and human.  I was absolutely thrilled to listen to his stories. Here's a guy that I grew up on, the main force behind the second wave of the american avant garde.

At the end of the night or morning depending on how you look at it, he takes me out to eat at a nearby diner. We chat some more, a little about politics, he tells me that time is gradually moving faster and faster but we can't tell because we have no reference point. That scares the shit out of me, the only thing I need more than money is time. I'm suprised at how much both he and Curtis keep up with contemporary film. They know more about current films than I do. Kenneth knows Vincent Gallo and knew the late Elliot Smith. He's so magnetic, he strikes up conversations with nearly every stranger we encounter about everything from Egypt to Porn shops.

Amazingly, he talks very little about himself or his past and he's managed to dodge my interview requests all night. After I asked him for maybe the third time he seems to respond positively but then gives me a very intense look and says in a low deep voice, ""I've got plans for you."" I'm not at all certain what he meant by that, though I'm certain it wasn't a come on. Very mysterious, very cryptic.

I'm afraid I can't  talk about a lot of the things we've talked about as he's made me promise not to. He's a very dear man and a very intense presence. I'm worried about him because his landlord has raised his rent and he's going to have to move out by mid november. He's not sure where he'll go, he's worried he may have to put all his belongings in storage. God I wish I was smart enough to figure out how to play the game and make a million dollars, I wish I could help out artists. So many people deserve better than what they're given. Don't seem fair.

I guess untill America learns to appreciate art and realize how much it affects their world however unconsciously, we'll all have to suffer through. I hope I make it as long as Kenneth Anger has. He's nearly eighty years old and he'll probably live to be over a hundred!

I take him home, we exchange numbers and warm embraces, making plans to go to an erotic art show next month.

Amazingly, even though it's 4:30 AM I have to go to work. In fact I should've been at work six hours ago, but I skipped out in favor of Dr. Anger. I must find a way out of this capitalistic lobster labyrinth, maybe i should try my hand at writing porn, anything to be able to be home for a while. I put in a few lazy hours at work and then run a few errands, by the time I get home it's 10. I'm exhausted. I've been running around on very little sleep for two days. As I lay in my bed trying to take in the night's events I realize it's Sept. 30th, the date James Dean drove as fast as he could out of this life.

There's some email circulating about two draft bills. The email claims the Bush administration is trying to sneak them by while everyone is distracted by the election and that the draft could be in effect as soon as April 2005. However, the bills are not new, they date back to Jan. 2003 and they were both introduced by democrats. I don't think this email chain is something to take too seriously. It's not that I doubt the possibility of the Bush administration resorting to a draft situation, it's just better to wait until a reliable news source presents information.

""The idea there are x number of insurgents, and that when they're all dead we can get out is wrong. The insurgency has shown an ability to regenerate itself because there are people willing to fill the ranks of those who are killed""... ""Most Iraqis consider us occupiers, not liberators."" 

Retired general William Odom, former head of the National Security: ""This is far graver than Vietnam. There wasn't as much at stake strategically, though in both cases we mindlessly went ahead with the war that was not constructive for US aims. But now we're in a region far more volatile, and we're in much worse shape with our allies.""... ""I've never seen [tensions] so bad between the office of the secretary of defence and the military.

That's a lot of breast but I would gladly sit through it, if anyone could do it, it would be Russ. Russ was an especially smart editor. He had a way with montages and cuts that added up to funny visual puns and sex jokes.  Did you know he was hired by Malcom McClaren to make a movie with the sex pistols? It fell through of course, but I heard he got along well with the band. Russ's kind of films don't get made anymore. I miss them.  Breast in peace Russ Meyer."

"event","Friday night- I go to the Egyptian to see What's the Matter with Helen? The print isn't as good as it should be. Timothy Carey is a great character actor. Great face. Harrington, Cassavetes, and Kazan all used him. I wish there was someone like him still around.

Afterwards Curtis Harrington does a Q and A. It's his birthday. Everyone in the theater sings Happy Birthday to him. He tells a bunch of funny anecdotes. Very good story teller as always. 

Afterwards I think I see Kenneth Anger in the audience but he disappears before I can be certain. I give Curtis a birthday gift, a voodoo doll from new orleans and some Poe readings on tape. He thanks me but is cold. He says the reason he hasn't called me back is because of my answering machine message. He calls it ""ghastly"" and asks me why I would subject my friends to it. I can't believe I've offended Curtis Harrington, I apologize, he says he won't call me untill I change the message. I don't think he's written me off completely because just before I leave he says we should get coffee sometime. I changed my message.

Saturday- I see Incident at Loch Ness. I'm sorry but I could care less about mockumentaries. It's such a tired genre. But it's great to see Werner Herzog, he's very funny in it. For the first 30 minutes you think it's going to be great because it hasn't gone over the top silly yet, it's just following Werner around. His wife is a beautiful Russian woman. He's the only actor in the film that's believable, everyone else is ""acting"" like they're in a documentary, but Werner understands how to be himself, everyone else is just acting like themselves.

After the screening I go next door to cinefile where Werner is scheduled to make an appearance. I help them get ready for it. The guy who directed Incident at Loch Ness shows up first. He seems like a dork. Everyone's getting ready for this event and he's bothering them to find a copy of Spinal Tap. During the film it felt like this hack writer guy had just taken advantage of a friendship with Werner, and when I  see the dork at the store I get that vibe again.

Werner shows up- Very friendly, big smiles (except when his picture is being taken), he signs my copy of Herzog on Herzog and tells me I should look online for a copy of his book On Walking on Thin Ice, which he wrote while walking to Paris to see Lotte Eisner before she died- ""It's better than all my films combined"". He signs everyone's stuff and answers all sorts of stupid questions. He tells the old stories. He speaks very movingly about Klaus Kinski, saying that he's not dead at all, that he still feels him alive as ever, keeps refering to him in present tense. 

What else did he talk about- He says he loves Fred Astaire- ""even though he has the most insipid face"". He talks about living in LA- ""I truly love it."" He talks about two films he's making right now, one being about a guy who lived with grizzly bears for twenty years. He also makes it very clear that he did not direct Incident at Loch Ness (You would too). The people from Cinefile bring a big picture of a hotdog and ask him to sign it ""Werner Hotdog"". Werner doesn't get it, he doesn't understand jokes. He was a very intense presence, a remarkable man, very happy, full of life. 

Sunday- I play kickball in drag at the park with the KXLU folk. But by this point I've put in 20 hours at work on top of the 40 I put in during the week, so I'm very tired. I leave early and nod off a dozen times at the wheel. I get a letter from my insurance company today that says my insurance has been cancelled, so it's a very good thing I didn't get in an accident, how embarrassing to rear end some one and have to tell them I have no insurance all the while being in drag. I get home in a daze that I can't even remember and then sleep for 20 hours!

I get a message from Ebbie today, she ran into John Gilmore at a gallery and got an interview with him. What serendipity! It was meant to be."

- Marion Carr Knox on memos regarding Bush's service.

She says her boss Lt. Col. Jerry Killian did say the things in the memo, that he was being pressured to sugar coat reports on Bush's performance and that the future president was receiving special treatment.

It's like in Touch of Evil when Orson Welles plants evidence to prove what he knows to be true.

I used to dislike Michael Moore. I felt like Bowling for Columbine was cheating, that the trick editing and subjective style made it propaganda, That all it did was provide more ammunition for right wingers to use against the left. But by the time Fareheit 9/11 came out I was in full on attack mode, yes I think it's time to sink to their level. It's a dirty job but if we don't do it, we're going to be in for four more years.

When you have blind faith, you don't need proof of anything, whether it be proof of weapons of mass destruction, proof of an Iraq-9/11 connection, or proof that the man you're voting for is honest. He's a man of God, isn't he? The devil knows the bible like the back of his hand. 

Why would a man of God when asked how he thinks he will be remembered in American history by Bob Woodward shrug and answer, ""We won't know, we'll all be dead."" What happened to the afterlife? Aren't you, Reagan, and Jesus going to be looking down from a cloud on the world? Or did you mean we will all be dead (without heaven) thanks to what you call a crusade and they call Jihad? Dick Cheney was almost right, ""A day of great Hell is coming for America"". Luckily Americans will only put up with so much corruption and lies. fuck the polls of ""likely voters"". This year is going to be record turn out for people kicking themselves for not voting last time.

I can not wait to see the look on his face when he realizes he has followed in his father's footsteps to the very end, being a one term wonder, one for the blooper reel of american history. A joke on Saturday Night Live reruns.   

""Nineteen individuals have served both in the National Guard and as president of the United States,"" Bush said, ""and I'm proud to be one of them.""

"event","So after many, many changes in the schedule, I was instructed to show up at Drew Univerity for the New Jersey Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired's annual Summer Precollege program.&nbsp; Mom and I left around 3 PM, hoping to show up by 5 to receive the campus tour and introduction; however, due to heavy storms and traffic all along 278, we didn't get there until about 5:45.&nbsp; We quickly made a mad dash for ""The Commons"" for dinner before the kitchen closed, but with our luck, we missed it by about 8 seconds.&nbsp; So we stole some snacks from another camp that was there. 

At this point, I moved over to our ""Reserved Seating Area"" in The Commons and proceeded to say hello to all the awesome friends who I haven't seen in over a year.&nbsp; I also received some very good news and some very bad news.

Good News: Rosalee would not be attending because she had to go to summer school this year.&nbsp; (Rosalee fell on me at the water park last year, and in her mind that means we were officially going out.&nbsp; Then, she fell on me in the pool and brushed my face with her lips... [which was our first make out session] )
Bad News: The Comission f/t Blind and VI had the Internet turned off on the 2nd and 3rd floors of Baldwin Hall... meaning, no unsupervised Internet access... SHIT!

Mom left after I carried load after load of luggage and computer whatnots to my temp room.&nbsp; (because I was late, I needed to get a key from Public Safety for my real dorm, so they threw me in a ""Janitor-type closet area thing"")

We had a quick rules session, icebreaker, and floor meeting, then we were free until 10PM, so I went with Pete, our floor captain RA, to Public Safety to get my real room key.&nbsp; After moving all my shit for the second time, and rearranging my furniture to my liking, I was pretty wiped out, so I went to bed at about 11:30"

"event","So I received a few emails the other day from the DataCities web hosting control panel informing me that we had a malicious user attempt to brute force our administrative account.&nbsp; I banned his IP address and I thought nothing more of it, as this sort of thing happens occasionally.&nbsp; Today, a ticket gets opened on the helpdesk by a new user who signed up this morning.&nbsp; He asked to have the IP ban removed as it was his friend who attempted to login to his account 3 times, but was typing the password incorrectly.&nbsp; I found this odd, because our system only bans IP's who attempt to login to the administrative account.&nbsp; Not recalling the specific IP, I checked our security logs and found the reason listed as ""Attempting to crack the admin password"".<br /><br />
<div text=""See my response..."" class=""ljcut"">Mr. Font,<br />  <br />  IP addresses are not banned from our web site because for failed login attempts to user accounts. The user at IP address 71.81.107.253 attempted a brute force attack on our LPanel Client Management System on June 18th and June 19th. According to detailed security logs for those dates, the user attempted to crack passwords for the administrative account of our CMS. According to our internal security policy, the IP ban is permanent and will not be removed for any reason. In addition, as this account was created today, I find it very suspicious that you are submitting a request for an IP ban removal from a date prior to the account's creation. I am marking your account for review and am turning this information over to our security analysts for further review.<br />  <br />  <br />  <strong>Casey J. Burkhardt</strong><br />  Technical Support Manager<br />  Datacities Inc.</div>
<br />He then replied and thanked me for the information, but informed me that it was certainly not him and he was not involved with the situation.&nbsp; I did some further investigating and found 13 entries in the account sign up log with the IP address in question.&nbsp; All the sign ups had Mr. Font's personal contact info and domain name.&nbsp; I was extremely pissed off.&nbsp; I cannot stand being lied to.<br /><br />
<div text=""See my response..."" class=""ljcut"">Mr. Font,<br /> <br /> Since the 18th of June, we have recorded a total of 13 sign up attempts from 71.81.107.253 with your personal contact information and domain name associated with the attempted sign up. This indicates to me that the user at 71.81.107.253 is in fact you. DataCities Inc. maintains a very strict policy against abuse and any type of hacking. I will provide you with one opportunity to reveal your intentions with our services prior to sending the letters I have composed to the Miami-Dade County District Attorney and Charter Communication Inc. of the hacking attempts on our CMS.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Casey J. Burkhardt</strong><br /> Technical Support Manager<br /> Datacities Inc.</div>
<br /> Then the ticket activity dropped off.&nbsp; I'm waiting for his response before I send off those emails. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what some people's problems are.&nbsp; I'm now officially more pissed off then I have been for a while.&nbsp; I saw those entries in the sign up log and just became so enraged...&nbsp; I can't stand being lied to.&nbsp; I squeezed a Pepsi can and I cut my hand.&nbsp; =[<br /> <br /> I have a motto that I always live by... absolutely no exceptions...<br /> <br /> ""Only trust once"".<br /> <br /> Fin."

"event","So today was ""interesting"".&nbsp; I went over to Amanda's grandparents for the afternoon and... I laughed my friggin' ass off.&nbsp; I swear to God, she has the funniest group of relatives I have ever encountered.&nbsp; Here are just a few of the items we discussed:

- Cream Cheese
- Moldy Cheese
- D Batteries
- Pool Tiles
- 60+ SPF Sun Block
- Lumpkins
- 10 Year Erections - Penal Implants - Hung Jury - Baseball - Pitching Tents
- South Park
- Amanda's Grandmother: ""Hard-on""
- Hair Dryer Speeds
- Human Albinos are NOT Real

What was really interesting was how I had to hold my tongue and not swear AT ALL.&nbsp; I'm proud to say, I did a damn good mother f*cking job... =D

Afterwards, we went back to Amanda's place and watched ""Crash"" which was really good.&nbsp; Then we migrated to her computer room and turned on ""Black on Broadway"", which was friggin' awEsome!

After I got home, we ended up talking some more on AIM.&nbsp; She's still convinced that I'm going to break up with her... I'm really not... honestly... I'm not... One day she'll trust me =["

"event","So after close to 200 attempts at writing a bit of code to be used in locking a Flash Movie, I FINALLY figured it out!&nbsp; Good thing too, because I was planning on pulling an all-nighter if I had to.<br /><br />
<div text=""See the code..."" class=""ljcut"">//Movie Will Not Play<br />okToPlay = ""FALSE"";<br /><br />//Configuration Block<br />site = ""http://domain.com/"";<br />www = ""http://www.domain.com/"";<br />ssite = ""https://domain.com/"";<br />swww = ""https://www.domain.com/"";<br />errorpageURL = ""http://www.tutpanel.com/domain_validator.php?order_id=########"";<br /><br />//Movie Will Play if URL's Match (http:// http://www. https:// https://www.)<br />if (_url.substr(0,site.length) == site || _url.substr(0,www.length) == www || _url.substr(0,ssite.length) == ssite || _url.substr(0,swww.length) == swww)<br />{<br />okToPlay = ""TRUE"";<br />}<br /><br />//If URL's Do Not Match, Bring Up Error Page and Kill The Movie<br />if (okToPlay == ""FALSE"")<br />{<br />getURL(errorpageURL);<br />unloadMovie(_root);<br />}<br /></div>
<br />Essentially, it only allows the movie to be played on the domain to which it is registered.&nbsp; Comes in handy when you're trying to keep your work from being stolen or copied.<br /><br />Next Flash Project: MySQL Database Integration...&nbsp; That's going ot require some Advil.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Amanda's coming over for dinner tomorrow... I think I may have to tie up my embarrassing ass parents and throw them in a closet... Whatever"

"event","So today was basically a very uneventful and boring day...<br /><br />I've been listening to Brahms' Sonata in E Minor, Op. 38 for the last hour.&nbsp; I give anyone who listens to the complete work, which is about 28 minutes, a lot of well deserved respect...<br /><br /><a href=""http://plasmahosting.net/music/1.MP3"">Movement I - Allegro Non Troppo</a> - 14:38<br /><a href=""http://plasmahosting.net/music/2.MP3"">Movement II - Allegretto Quasi Menuetto</a> - 5:48<br /><a href=""http://plasmahosting.net/music/3.MP3"">Movement III - Allegro</a> - 6:26<br /><br />2nd Movement will be my senior solo next year, but after listening to the entire work a few times, I'm thinking about asking to do a section from the 1st Movement instead.<br /><br />--<br /><br />So today was the one month anniversary of when Amanda and I started going out... Why do I remember that?&nbsp; I have no fucking clue...&nbsp; I feel like I'm on the skit from Blue Collar TV where they whole family gets together to celebrate a 7 day anniversary... Kind of weird.... Whatever.<br /><br />That's really all I have for today...."

I'm really not sure where I should go with this.&nbsp; This isn't really a very significant first entry... is it?

Oh well, I'll think of something better tomorrow."

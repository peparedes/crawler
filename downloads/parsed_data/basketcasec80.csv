Monday, it seemed like everything was okay.  It all made sense, everything I had been told...seemed so perfect.  He was there for me... and then Wednesday...shit hits the fan.  I barely fell asleep last night, I was crying my eyes out.  It hurts so bad...and he doesn't understand.  He'll never understand...

I can't imagine all the people that you know 
and the places that you go 
when the lights are turned down low 
and I don't understand all the things you've seen 
but i'm slipping inbetween 
you and your big dreams 
it's always you 
in my big dreams 

and you tell me that it's over 
wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clover 
and your restless, and i'm naked 
you've gotta get out 
you can't stand to see me shaking 
no 
could you let me go? 
I didn't think so 

and you don't wanna be here in the future 
so you say the present's just a pleasent interruption to the past 
and you don't wanna look much closer 
cuz your afraid to find out all this hope
you had sent into the sky by now had crashed 
and it did 
because of me 

and then you bring me home 
afraid to find out that you're alone 
and i'm sleeping in your living room 
we don't have much room to live 

I had these dreams that i learned to play guitar 
maybe cross the country 
become a rock star 
and there was hope in me that i could take you there 
but dammit you're so young 
well i don't think i care 
and if i hurt you 
then i'm sorry 
please don't think that this was easy 

then you bring me home 
cuz we both know what it's like to be alone 
and i'm dreaming in your living room 
we don't have much room to live 

and konstantine is walking down the stairs 
doesn't she look good 
standing in her underwear 
and i was thinking 
what i was thinking 
we've been drinking and it doesn't get me anywhere 

my Konstantine came walking down the stairs 
and all that i could do is touch her long blonde hair 
and i've been thinking 
it hurts me thinking that these nights
when we were drinking no they never got us anywhere 
no 

this is because i can spell konfusion with a k 
and i like it 
it's to dying in another's arms and why I had to try it 
it's to jimmy eat world and those nights in my car 
but this time im alone and I dont see those stars
I'm not your star 
isn't that what you said 
what you thought this song meant 

and if this is what it takes 
just to lie in my mistakes 
and live with what i did to you 
and all the hell I put you through 
I always catch the clock 
it's 11:11 
and now you want to talk 
it's not hard to dream 
you'll always be my konstantine 

konstantine, they'll never hurt you like i do 
no they'll never hurt you like i do 
no, no, no no no no no no 

this is to a girl who got into my head 
with all the pretty things she did 
hey 
you know 
you keep me up in bed 
this is to a girl who got into my head 
with all the fucked up things i did 
hey 
maybe 
baby 
you could keep me up in bed 
my Konstantine 
spin around me like a dream we played out on this movie screen 
and i said 
did you know i missed you? 
oh god i miss you 

and then you bring me home 
and we'll go to sleep, but this time, not alone, no no 
and you'll kiss me in your living room 
i know 
you'll miss me in your living room 
cuz these nights i think maybe that i'll miss you in my living room 
we don't have much room 
i said does anybody need that room? 
because we all need a little more room 
to live 

my Konstantine

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now 

Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now 

And all the roads we have to walk along are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
I don't know how 

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one who saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall 

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do

And all the roads that lead to you were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
I don't know how 

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one who saves me?
And after all

I said maybe

It's crazy what one day with him does for us.  I'm still smiling.  Let's recap.

-Comes over yesterday around 1-2 (i think?)
-Schooling each other in video games
-Listening to music (DC...hell yes)
-Playing some vball
-Acting like an old married couple
-The jokes last night
-Finding out that he was staying over
-Staying up until 12:30 with him
-Waking up crazy early to go to work and seeing him
-HE CAME AND VISITED ME AT WORK

OH WHAT NOW.  It doesn't seem like much but it's exactly what I needed.

I feel...happy right now.  Nothing can bring me down right now.  

Only good things.  Good things mean no bad things happen.  And no bad things means Ben, Michelle, and other people won't yell at me.  NO BAD THINGS!"

What to report?  Oh right.  I'm sick of bitching about it and hating myself for it.  I'm gonna do it.  Starting right now.  It's time to actually do it.  I'm going to lose weight and I'm going to be happy with myself by the end of the summer.  I don't care what it takes.  I want to do it and I'm old enough to be able to do it.  Maybe it will keep my mind off of something else (right, Ben?)

In other news, she's mad at me and it doesn't even seem like she cares.  Great, just great.  Another person I've pushed away.  It's like no matter what I do, I'm alone.  I just...wish that she wasn't mad.  *beats head on desk* Ahhhhh I just wish..."

How am I going to survive in this house with the nazi without her?  I...*wants to scream* am going to miss her.  It's weird, cause when Alex and I used to fight all the time when I was in like sixth grade, the three years seemed so far away.  Now, I'm almost done with freshman year in high school, she's done, today it ended, and it seems like we never even had some sort of a relationship.  It's weird.  She graduates in about two weeks, that's crazy.  She never has to walk through those doors again, she never has to look at all those people in the hallways...it's just weird...

As I leave here today, apartment 108 
I'll always keep you in my heart. 
Anderson is cold tonight, 
The leaves are scattered on the ground. 
I miss the seasons, 
And the comfort of your smile. 

Sometimes this all feels like a dream. 
I'm waiting for someone to just wake me up, 
From this life. 

<i>As I look out at these fairgrounds, 
I remember how our family split apart. </i>
I don't think I ever told you, 
But I know you always did your best. 
<b>And the hard times, 
They only made us stronger. </b>

<b>As I sit here all alone, 
I wonder how I'm suppose to carry on when you're gone. </b>
<i>I'll never be the same without you, 
I love you more then you will ever know. </i>
So maybe now you finally know. 
Sometimes we're helpless and alone, 
But you can let it keep you weighted down. 
You must go on. 

<i><b>Do you ever feel like crying? 
Do you ever feel like giving up? 
I raise my hands up towards the sky, 
I say this prayer for you tonight, 
Because nothing is impossible. </i> </b>

Do you know what it's like to not talk to you before falling asleep?

Do you know what's been going through my head every time I hear ""Wonderwall""?

Do you know how hard it's been for me to hold on these past few weeks?  

I'm so scared of where I'm headed and I feel like sometimes you don't want to be there.

I've been thinking more and more of what some sort of future would be like with you...but I don't know if you are...

I feel like you don't know how to read my emotions and my actions anymore...

I just want to go back in time three months...

I miss you and it hurts."

"event","""Maybe in another life I could find you there.  Pulled away before your time I can't deal it's so unfair. And it feels, and it feels like heaven's so far away.  And it feels, yeah it feels like the world has grown cold now that you've gone away.  Leaving flowers on your grave to show that I still care.  But black roses and Hail Mary's can't bring back what's taken from me.  I reach to the sky and call out your name. And if I could trade I would."" 

Another one of the many Offspring songs that I do indeed love with all of my heart.  Stupid Brendon, getting me into them.  *flips off IM window*

Wanna know why?

Cause I can't edit my own style.

Fuck me.

Stupid livejournal. 

*goes back to deadjournal for right now*

I'm too lazy to do overrides.

I like style edits better.

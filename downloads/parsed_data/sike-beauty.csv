"event","I just want to know what the gotdamn point of having a private journal is. And befoer I move along with my inquiries, no I'm not mad because someone didn't allow me to read their stuff. Everyone I want to read about has me added, so I'm cool on that.

It's just that I don't think everybody's so fucking important that they feel the need to close their journals to everybody .. when it's on a damn website anyway. Although it IS their perrogative, it's still like what the fuck?

And then they unblock other online people. People they don't even really fucking know.

That's why I say people are fucking sheep.

Following each other all around the damn place and not having a fucking clue as to why they do it. And it's REAL evident online if not anywhere else.

I mean, go to somebody's blog and check their graphics if they're a `good` designer. THE SHIT has the same basic elements and maybe even colors as any other design website. There are actually two people who i really respect for their artistic genius when it comes to web design. two and only two, well three, but she stopped. and i'm not saying shit to be nice because i hardly talk to these people anymore, and as a matter of fact i don't even KNOW one of them. 

<a href=""http://hny.urban-graffiti.net"" target=""x"">Ki</a>
<A href=""http://guerillalove.com"" target=""x"">Essy</a> (I think)
and my twin, neesa.
I used to like Sacha's stuff too, and the designer at slumbeautiful.com.

But outside of that? Everybody's shit is the gotdamn same. Everybody isnt' a fucking artist. 

Wait, I like <A href=""http://nopattern.com"" target=""x"">this one</a> too. Shit is just repetetive.

And what about me?

I haven't put out a graphic in a long time, so maybe heads don't even remember what my work looks like, but the shit ain't remind me of nobody else's shit. It just gets to a point where it's disgusting that I see the same damn brushes on every site, the same usage of the brushes, the same squiggly unnecessary lines. it's jus tso repetitive. 

anyhow. wasn't my original point that I can't stand private journals?that's just an instance of copying too. 

man that's it for now.

another new journal?! what?! damn jamie! i know how you feel. but i just couldn't stick around on <a href=""http://livejournal.com/users/_par"">_par</a> anymore. it still fits my mood, but nah. but for those of you who were like ""Wtf is a damn par anyway?"" par has something to do with ""talk"" in french. yeah, i took that in high school, but i managed to forget everything about it ... but i mean damn that <u>was</u> two years ago. i feel so old now. <s>anyway, could everybody re-add me? i'll love you forever ... i'll even ensure that i stick around on this LJ for more than three months. :) plz?! .. </s>

<b>edit</b>- as a matter of fact, don't even add me. i'll use this livejournal to update and ya'll can leave comments here if you want. i'll just read friends entrie from par to make it easier for everybody.

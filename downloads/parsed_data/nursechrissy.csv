"event","I believe that our soul is here to learn lessons and that there are other souls that help us with those lessons. Some souls teach us the lessons, some souls support us as we learn them, and some are companions along the way. I believe that a person's family is one big soul group- that teaches *and* supports us- and that we find the rest of our companion souls throughout our life. Sometimes unexpectedly.

When you first emailed me, I was looking for new friends. I didn't expect to fall in love. Our souls were so compatible. We'd been through so many similar experiences- we'd both been married to men; we both had children; we both came out in our 30's; we both had been in not-so-great relationships with women (to put it nicely); we've both experienced misdirection and pain and loss. We seemed so well equipped to help each other with the lessons we were working on and to keep each other company along the way.

Since we've met, everything about our relationship has seemed peaceful and easy. Even with the chaos surrounding us, things between us are calm. We don't feel that we need to be everything to each other. We're able to give each other room to breathe. But we can be so incredibly close as well. We can talk about anything. We trust each other. We're there for each other when things are crazy. Your grace and kindness and strength inpire me.

We've always said that we want balance- not necessarily 50/50. Sometimes 60/40. Sometimes 80/20. But then it shifts the other way and there's always balance.

We've joked that our goal is ""boring"". In comparison to how our lives have been in the past, I think we've attained that, but the kind of boring that we have is so much fun. Instead of drama we have dragons. Instead of craziness (the bad kind) we have caterpillers. Instead of fighting we have fairies.

I love you with everything that I am. I love what we're creating in our home and with our boys. I promise to continue to love Jason as my own son and, together with you, raise all three boys to be good, confident, and respectful men. It's so much fun watching them grow and helping them figure out who they're going to be.

I promise to be there for you when you need me. I promise to listen to you. I promise to be open and honest with you. I promise to respect you.

You are my best friend, my confidant, my lover and my partner. Together, we can accomplish anything. Thank you for finding me."

"event","I don't know if anyone still reads this, but...

I have a lot going on in my world and I need to get some of it out.

Rae and I are having a commitment ceremony on Saturday. We've been planning hard and everything is coming together nice.  There are going to be almost 90 people there.  The theme is vintage carnival.  Maybe I'll post pictures.

The other big thing is that my mother is dying. She's been really sick since last December and has only been home for about 5 weeks since then. She's had a staph infection that's been affecting different systems- heart, knees and spine. She had a spinal fusion in January (lumbar spine) and multiple surgeries before and after that to close wounds and clean out her knees and surgical sites. The most recent exacerbation has been in her upper spine and they can't do surgery on it. They're treating her medically and she's already paralyzed below her waist. The infection will eventually take over and at some point the antibiotics will be stopped and nature will be allowed to take it's course. She made me her Durable Power of Attorney for financial and medical decisions. No one knows how things will go. They're keeping her comfortable, so that's good.

So really, really good and really, really bad at the same time.

Talk about balance...

Oh, and I quit smoking. It's been four months now. So... at least I'm not smoking. 

Rae is a huge support and I'm actually doing pretty okay. I'm trying to have faith that everything is exactly as it should be."

"event","Haven't written in a while and don't feel like reading my book on the train this afternoon. I usually read during my commute, but instead figured I'd bore anyone that decides to read this.   

Things are good. I'm happy. There are things to work out, but I really think I'm doing okay. I'm madly in love with Rae and it gets better daily. The kids are doing alright. We have occasional issues but overall they're okay. 

Work is good. There have been some recent changes, but things will even out and hopefully get better.

The most exiting thing that's happened is that Rae painted our upstairs hallway this past weekend. It looks really good. Oh, and Nathan and I are building a dollhouse together. I guess some would consider that exciting. Coming up is the Midwinter Scottish and Irish Music Festival, which we love. Then Rae's birthday. 

I guess life's kinda boring, but that's been my goal for the past few years. No drama. A better term would be peaceful.  

Almost to the train station. 

Peace."

A few days ago I had this complicated situation that involved me speaking with Bill multiple times.  I left him a message. He left me a message. I called him. He called me. I called him a couple more times. Until the situation was resolved. 


Then I had to call Craig about a different issue. He had been calling me about an issue that I had to deal with. Someone else answered the phone and I asked for him, saying who I was. When he got on the phone, he said, ""Chris!""  I said, ""Bill!"" 

Oops. 

He said, ""What!?  Who's Bill?!  Are you cheating on me?  Is Bill another pharmacist?!  You're seeing another pharmacist!?""  I apologized profusely. Told him that I'd gotten his authorization. Said I'd fax it to him. He told me that I better put hearts all over it. I did. 

I like my job. And Bill got a big kick out of it when I told him the next day."

"event","On Friday Rae and I took the kids to the Kutztown Folk Festival. She hadn't been there since she was a kid, Jason had never been and me and my boys hadn't been in several years. We got a late start and didn't get to see everything, but we had a really good time. The food and crafts and animals are all so wonderful. 

The Festival ends at 6, so I had thought that we could go see Star Trek afterwards. Jason was going to be with his dad on Saturday and Sunday and Dylan and I agreed that Rae, Jason and Nathan all needed to see it. I checked movie times and the only place I could find it was past our house (from Kutztown) at 7:20. I couldn't find it playing anywhere near Kutztown. 

We got caught up in the Festival and left later than I wanted to. I told myself that if it was meant to be to get to the movie that we'd make it. I drove fast. Then I got lost. I'm sure I missed the turn because I was driving so fast. I gave up on the movie.

We got to Boyertown and there was this little tiny one screen theater. I pointed it out to Rae. She said, ""Look, it's playing Star Trek."" I slowed down to look at times. Only one showtime. In 5 minutes. I pulled into the lot and we ran to the theater. $3 for all shows. And it was an awesome little old theater. 

I guess I was being present."

She tells me that she hasn't been sleeping well. ""My sister-in-law died recently and she's at the house.""  I believe in this stuff, so say ""Wow. That's rough.""  She goes on,""She comes every night and then dies the next day."" We got to our floor. I wished her luck. What else do you say? It was only a one floor elevator ride."

I loved the movie and Dylan did, too. I need to get the series so he can see it. He was impressed that I could tell him ""That guy? He's McCoy"" and ""That's Scotty"" before the character said their name. ""How did you know?""

I think he would love the series. And I wouldn't mind watching it again."

"event","Saturday afternoon we went to a birthday party for my cousin's daughter.  Well, the one-year-old is essentially still my cousin.  So, we went to my cousin's 1st birthday party.  But that sounds weird.  Technically, she's my second cousin once removed.  The one that turned one.  But her grandmother, Carol- my first cousin once removed- was like a big sister to me- she babysat me and my brothers and I wore her hand-me-downs.  Which makes me feel old.  It was fun.

Sunday was the 41st annual Simon Wolfgang Family Reunion in Pitman, PA.  Simon was my grandmother's grandfather.  It was fun.  It's always fun.  I should write about it at some point.  Rae endured it.  My boys always like it.  Jason was camping with his dad.  We drove up with my brother and were making such good time that we stopped at Roadside America on the way.  We had lunch and the family meeting and then did the prizes and then went to the cemetery.  They put some of my Uncle Jim's ashes in my great-grandparent's plot and put a flag on Uncle Ken's grave.  Ken and Jim were my grandmother's younger brothers.  Ken passed 15 years ago and Jim passed a few months ago.  I got to chat with my cousin Bonnie who I never get to see- actually she's my dad's first cousin (Jim's daughter), so she's my first cousin once removed, but she's closer to my age.  She has 3 year old twins and we shared parenting stories.  

Carol from the first paragraph, is Ken's daughter.  

It was a really good weekend."

"event","Haven't posted in a while... Story of my life. Several things have prompted me to post. I got a message through Facebook from a friend saying that she wanted to hear how things were going, I met (in real life!) a bunch of new people (to me) that are on Live Journal, and I'm going through a bunch of transitional/emotional stuff in my life that would probably be good to vent about. 

I'm going to really try to write more. Maybe I can start slowly...

Rae and I have been in our house for a year now. We made settlement at the end of May and moved in at the end of June last year. Things are going so well. We're all dealing with the changes involved and we certainly have good days and bad days, but the good far outnumber the bad. We still have adjusting to do, but I think in another 6 or 12 months we'll be even better. 

The boys are all done school for the year and thrilled at having the summer off. They each have some half-day and full-day camp weeks at various times during the summer so that'll break things up for all of them- Rae included.

 Dylan's final grades this year were all A's and B's and he did so well with everything. I'm so proud of him. Nathan got the ""most progress"" award in his class. I'm so proud of him, too. And he's starting the alto saxophone in the fall. God help my ears. Jason had a great year, too. He applied to be a school safety next year and got a position. I'm so proud of him, too!  I don't remember when I last wrote, but he broke his arm a few months back and when he got his splint off 2 weeks ago, we noticed the bulls-eye rash and he was promptly diagnosed with Lyme's Disease. It was caught early and he'll be fine. 

My job is good. I still love it. I feel like a good resource for the department. I'm still trying to find my niche in the corporate ways of a giant hospital and maybe I never will. I don't get the politics. I don't want to play the games. But it's a good place that does good things and I like it and am proud to be a part of it. 

I'm going to try to write more often. I swear. Feel free to nudge me if you haven't heard from me. 

Peace."

There are still images below the video and, if you click on the video, you go to the ustream website where there are videos from right after they hatched.

So cute."

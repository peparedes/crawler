"event","Hey well I was gonna make a journal entry and talk about Megan, but it looks like a bunch of people have a problem with that. I guess some people think thats all I talk about and Im pathetic and tha onne of us is going to eventually go to jail. Pathetic ha. Lets talk about pathetic, maybe you think Im pathetic but what about the people tha are reading my journal all the time and commenting on what I do with my life constantly. I would say thats pretty pathetic too. I mean if you people dont have anything better to do besides jacking off at your computer screen all day and worrying about me going to jail then I would say you need to take a look in the mirror and you'll probably see the word ""Pathetic"" written right across your forehead. So yeah....I love you so much Megan. Lets see what you fuckfaces got to say now."

"event","so a few weeks ago i get the word that my name has been brought up for an awesome office job with yorktown parks and rec, so i talked to the people, they sent me some info, and it seemed like everything was just gravy.   Then came the phone interview, and i must say, if anyone gets in the situation where they have to take part in a phone interview....run!  It was more awkward than doing it in person because i don't think that the person interviewing me got a real sense of who i was. I come off very personable in person (that can't be gramatically correct), but on the phone i tend to be more shy i think.  So i was told that they were looking at two other people and that i should hear by the end of next week, which would have been last week.  So now i am extremly nervous that i didn't get it and i know that i should call them to see if any decision has been made, but i am scared that if i call they will be like, oh im sorry we gave it to someone else and didn't feel like telling you.  So I've been putting it off for the past few days, hoping they will call me....but it hasn't happened. So I AM going to call tomorrow, and hopefully i will find out what is going on.  
Wish me Luck :)"

"event","ok, tonight was one of the most fun nights i have had in a looong time.  Vanilla Ice played a free show at my schools student center and i have to say...IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was one of the largest crowds that i have eer seen here, and it was great to see that the student body at AU could actually put their snobbishness (is that a word?) aside and enjoy a good show.  Ice didn't dissapoint, while he played a lot of his new shit, he delivered on the 'Ice Ice Baby' and even a bit of 'Ninja Rap'. You have no idea how cool it is to hear a whole room of college kids chanting, ""go ninja go ninja go"" I couldn't help but wonder if he realized that the majority of the crowd was in kindergarten to third grade when he was popular,  that just made me laugh.  

Peace out.....ice ice baby (too cold, too cold), god that's going to be in my head all damn night"

"event","so yeah, this is my journal, i had one before but i never let anyone see it or know that i had one. This one i might actually use and let people see. I read everyone's anyway, so i felt that i should have my own.  


so hey everyone i will be home in less than a month.  that's right, by this time next month i will be finished with my first year of college, isnt that scary?  i can't wait to be back, but i have so much work to do in the next few weeks that i almost am dreading it.  i don't know, i'll be happy once i get through it all.

that's all for now. i'm bored with writing.

"event","<strong>Greetings my fellow lj readers,<br />I just came&nbsp; back from one of the most electrifying concerts ever at RamsHead Live. Taylor Hicks , the soulful silver haired Pop/Soul crooner from the heart and soul of Birmingham, Alabama..Rocked out to a sold out crowd in downtown Baltimore. Hicks, 30 sang his classics like ""Hell Of A Day"" and&nbsp; ""Soul Thing"" and some new songs that will be instant classics like&nbsp; the energetic toe tapper ""The Runaround"" and the upbeat&nbsp; Michael Mcdonald - esque&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; song ""Give Me Tonight"" ,&nbsp; The warm fuzzy ballad that was intended for the late Ray Charles&nbsp; but Taylor gives his magic touch ""The Right Place"" is an instant classic by that right. also Hicks performed his current radio friendly ballad ""Just To Feel That Way"" and a cover of&nbsp; ""Naked In The Jungle"" made famous by the great Van Morrison was also in the mix .The silver haired crooner came back for the encore wearing a purple Baltimore Ravens jersey.. need I say more!! He was lookin' fantastic and&nbsp; drenched in sweat. I&nbsp; wish I could've gotten closer.. but none the less the man was awesome&nbsp; and sexy!!&nbsp; The 30 year old&nbsp; even played the guitar with a strap with the words in silver writing&nbsp; ""Soul Patrol"".. How awesome is that!!&nbsp; I only wish I had the pictures from my brother's girlfiend's phone up&nbsp; so I can share the pics&nbsp;&nbsp; even though they are not close up ..but you can still tell it's Taylor!!<br />there will possibly be picture but not right now or tonight!!<br /><br />overall his performance was like a soulful spiritual experience.. hope to see him live again!! Taylor was amazing and really , sexy!!&nbsp; letter grade :A-<br /><br />Star grade ****1/2 ( Four and a Half stars)...<br /><br /><br />can't believe my adventure ended and I have to leave 2morrow.. I am happy and sad to leave ,&nbsp; I hate saying Good Bye!!<br /><br /><br />there will hopefully be pictures&nbsp; uploaded soon!!<br /><br />Take Care... peace love and Soul Patrol!!<br /><br /><br />~* Casey*~</strong>"

DownTown Baltimore is gonna be ruled by the Soul Patrol and thier silver haired fearless leader last seasons&nbsp; American Idol winner Taylor Hicks. Hicks who is now 30 will be ""Takin' It To The Streets"" of Baltimore&nbsp; tomorrow evening and wil be performing his originals and throw in a few cover tunes into his Soulful Pop based set list. The Birmingham , Alabama native covered classics ranging from&nbsp; his biggest musical influnces like Ray Charles, Billy Preston&nbsp; and one of the most famous Pop/ Rock groups who dove into Pop/Soul because of thier replacement front man who later went on to a budding solo career in 1982. The band I was refering to was The Doobie Brothers and the replacement front man i was talkin' about was Michael McDonald.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I am too excited I will finally get to see Taylor in person...!!*thud* It's gonna be awesome!!&nbsp; I promise I will post my review of the concert in my LJ maybe as soon as I get back from the concert ..god hoping I won't be too worn out to post&nbsp; !!&nbsp;<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r103/blinkofaneye1981/SoulfulSilverFoxes/TaylorHicks001.jpg"" /><a href=""http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r103/blinkofaneye1981/SoulfulSilverFoxes/taylorhicks01_story.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r103/blinkofaneye1981/SoulfulSilverFoxes/taylorhicks01_story.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Soul Patrol!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />too excited!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Taylor Hicks in person Oh My!! wooooooooooooooo!! *Thud*"

It's just an awesome power and glow that surounds him when he sings on stage. I believe Taylor has some mighty big shoes to fill in which he proved he could. The now 30 year old Alabama native garners a certified Gold single with his&nbsp; Post Idol anthem ""Do I Make You Proud"" the silver haired Soul man.. deems worthy to make a huge splash in the music world. Hicks is bring us back to a simpler time in Popular Music a feeling&nbsp; of relaxation and ease that was popular in the mid to late 70's and mid to early 80's called "" West Coast"" or ""California"" sound that was brought to light by&nbsp; artists like&nbsp; Christopher Cross, Kenny Loggins, Michael McDonald and&nbsp; Robbie Dupree , many more. The Music industry&nbsp; is in for a refreshing breath of fresh air&nbsp; when&nbsp; Taylor Hicks' major label debut will hit stores.. Hopefully by then ""Do I Make You Proud"" would be certified Platinum .&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't wait for his cd to come out. Lets hope it lives up to the hype and expectations we want and Taylor wants us to love.<br /><br />Taylor can't go wrong when he has the full support from great artists&nbsp; like&nbsp; Michael McDonald and John Mayer who contributed songs and&nbsp; Mayer even co wrote a song with Hicks also. It ought to be good. Taylor is also working with some of the horns from&nbsp;&nbsp; the amazing&nbsp; ""Tower Of Power"". The people&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp; Taylor would've loved having met and worked with are&nbsp; acclaimed drummer of the band Toto&nbsp;, Jeff Porcaro who&nbsp;was dear friend of Michael McDonald .Jeff passed&nbsp; away in 1992 and he'll be greatly missed. Also acclaimed singer / writer Chuck Sabatino who also passed away ..i don't when he passed though he was also a good friend of Michael McDonald to . Chuck is greatly missed as well and he would 've enjoyed working with Taylor if he was still alive as would Jeff.<br /><br />&nbsp;see you on the b-side!! later!!</span>"

"event","Greetings everyone,<br /><br />It's a start of a new month and almost not quite the&nbsp; end of summer. Thought I should let you all in the know about&nbsp; the release date for the major label debut cd by the sexy silver haired soulster who won&nbsp; my heart and everyone elses when he was on American Idol. I'm talking about the sweet southren gentleman&nbsp;with the most distinctive voice and smolderingly sexy charm , charisma. Last but not least the killer dance moves,&nbsp; Taylor Hicks. The 29 year old Pop / Soul crooner is flattered when people compaire him musically and&nbsp; vocally to the likes of&nbsp; Five Time Grammy winner Michael McDonald and the amazing Joe Cocker. The silver haired , brown eyed hottie is still on the road with all the other American Idol finalist through&nbsp; some point in Fall. Just after being named&nbsp; the new ""Idol"" Hicks appeared in an ad spot for auto maker Ford for their&nbsp; ""Model Year End Clearence"" the silver haired soulman signed on to do more spots for the car maker ,with a voice and style&nbsp; so sophisticated just give him an ad campaign with a great song to go with it..he couald sell you anything...heck&nbsp; even long distance phone plans..like Michael Mcdonald did with MCI&nbsp;in 2003 and also for Verizon/ MCI business this year. Basically Taylor Hicks is this generation's distinctive&nbsp; voice he's following in great footsteps and making a way for himself to be heard . The 29 year old Birmingham , Alabama native is&nbsp;by all means the next Michael Mcdonald, he wears his heart and soul on his sleeve and&nbsp;shares his love, passion for the music he creates and brings new life to.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The&nbsp; Sexy, Soulful&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop/ Soul crooner's major label debut&nbsp; is untitled for now but the album&nbsp;is set to be released on November 14th*.&nbsp; please remember&nbsp;to mark your calendars&nbsp; for that!!<br /><br />* the date may change but for all I know its November 14th!!<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://digitalhavendesigns.com/taylorhicks/albums/wpw-20060521/th001.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://digitalhavendesigns.com/taylorhicks/albums/wpw-20060521/th001.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://digitalhavendesigns.com/taylorhicks/albums/wpw-20060521/blog64fw.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://digitalhavendesigns.com/taylorhicks/albums/wpw-20060521/blog64fw.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><strong>""Bold...

"event","Greetings one and all,<br />I haven't be posting much on LJ lately...because I am caught up in ""Soul Patrol"" Mania!! I really don't&nbsp; have any new Rob Lowe news except he's working on a new filck in Canada this month ..it's a follow up to the 1999 thriller ""Stir Of Echoes"" called "" Stir Of Echoes : The Dead Speak"". Also ""Thank You For Smoking"" is slated to be on DVD on October 3rd...keep an eye out for that kids!!<br /><br />Speaking of&nbsp; the newly named American Idol... Taylor Hicks, His single ""Do I Make You Proud""? is still rising on the charts...lets hope it's certified gold before&nbsp; the silver haired Pop/ Soul crooner's major label Debut&nbsp; that will soon to be released some point this Fall.&nbsp; The 29 year old Birmingham, Alabama native graced the cover of People Magazine and also named ""Hottest&nbsp; Single Guy"".. the soulfully sexy songster is flattered to be compaired to five time Grammy winner Michael Mcdonald and also has the good looks to easily be mistaken&nbsp; for&nbsp; Oscar winner&nbsp; George Clooney.. I think 2006 belongs to Taylor Hicks and other silver haired celebrities... namely Mr. Clooney and Mr. Mcdonald&nbsp; also Mr. Anderson Cooper. Hicks is currently on tour with&nbsp; the 9 other finalists of American Idol...until mid September&nbsp; or October ...not sure... I will keep you posted on Taylor's Album release date!!&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also catch Michael Mcdonald on Tour with Steely Dan until Early September.<br /><br />Take Care!! *Soul Patrol*!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://DeniseBernadette.smugmug.com/photos/82022101-L.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://DeniseBernadette.smugmug.com/photos/82022101-L.jpg"" /></a><br /><br /><br />I Love Taylor Hicks!!!&nbsp; but&nbsp; I Love&nbsp; Rob Lowe*( *Damn He's Married and 42 , has kids but I still love him) I Love&nbsp; Taylor more than Rob... Taylor is by far sexier than&nbsp; Rob(lol) ... Aww... I can't say that I love both of them and think both are really sexy... But I am more likely to end up marrying Taylor&nbsp; instead of Rob Lowe.:) If Taylor was to ever ask me to marry him..my answer would be ""Yes"" for&nbsp; sure!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://DeniseBernadette.smugmug.com/photos/82021479-L.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://DeniseBernadette.smugmug.com/photos/82021479-L.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />*Thud** Love it when he smiles and has a good time....

"event","Sorry I Haven't posted in my LJ for the last few weeks or maybe months on end. I turned 25 years old last Monday&nbsp; and My Fave American Idol contestant Taylor Hicks is so much closer to being named ""Our Next American Idol"" He's kinda a hybrid of&nbsp; Michael Mcdonald and Joe Cocker...but more like Michael Mcdonald. The 29 year old Birmingham, Alabama native&nbsp; deserves to be named ""American Idol 2006"" because he is just the type of musical talent we need right now. Just my opinion. Hicks reminds me of a young Michael Mcdonald minus the facial hair and the blue eyes.. why he reminds me of him ""Taylor has this passion and love for the music&nbsp; that has been passed along to generation to generation"".&nbsp; Hicks&nbsp; is bringing new life to the style of music that&nbsp; five time Grammy winner Mcdonald&nbsp; has done before him, ""Blue Eyed Soul"" or ""Vanilla Soul"" , ""Pop/Soul"". Here is a little fact: Michael Mcdonald was about&nbsp; 29 or 30 when he garnered his first Top 10 hit in 1982 with ""I Keep Forgettin' (Everytime You're Near)"".I think Taylor Hicks has the ""Heart and Soul"" and Talent to be our next ""Idol"".&nbsp;<br />One day&nbsp; Taylor will garner Grammy Gold like one of his major vocal influences, Michael Mcdonald. I will be shocked if Mcdonald now 54 joins&nbsp; Hicks on stage during the Results night extravaganza. Taylor sang one of the greatest Doobie Brothers songs ever penned by Mcdonald *(*besides ""What A Fool Believes"" which he co wrote with Kenny Loggins) I am talking about&nbsp; The Doobies 1976 hit ""Takin' It To The Streets""..Hicks recorded it for ""The American Idol Season5: Encores"" cd out Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Taylor is so In It ..To&nbsp; Win It*!! *Go Taylor!!<br /><a href=""http://us.tv1.yimg.com/tv.yahoo.com/images/he/photo/tv_pix/fox/american_idol_2006/may09_taylor.jpg""><img style=""WIDTH: 185px; HEIGHT: 332px"" height=""377"" width=""253"" alt="""" src=""http://us.tv1.yimg.com/tv.yahoo.com/images/he/photo/tv_pix/fox/american_idol_2006/may09_taylor.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />Even famous people watch ""American Idol"" in an interview with Brooke Anderson at the End Of April. Anderson sat down with Former West Wing star and 80's Sex Symbol&nbsp;, Rob Lowe.&nbsp; The blonde Headline News Entertaiment Correspondent asked if&nbsp; the&nbsp; attractive blue eyed actor now 42,who was dressed in a buttoned down white dress shirt and khaki&nbsp; pants said he watches the&nbsp; show&nbsp; he's addicted&nbsp; to it . Anderson failed to ask the Sexy star who he was pulling for to win. I hope Lowe&nbsp; is pulling for Taylor...!! It would be awesome&nbsp; to see the&nbsp; 42 year old father&nbsp; of&nbsp; two sport a shirt that says ""Soul Patrol"" or ""Got Soul"". We'll never know we may see Lowe in the audience&nbsp; during the finale either one of the two nights or both nights at the Kodak.&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/he/photo/movie_pix/sundance/sundance_film_festival_2006_photos/rob_lowe/sff06_hollywoodb3.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""http://us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/he/photo/movie_pix/sundance/sundance_film_festival_2006_photos/rob_lowe/sff06_hollywoodb3.jpg"" /></a>&nbsp;<br /> I am still wondering&nbsp; who Rob is a fan of&nbsp; for ""American Idol"" ? so is everyone else Rob, we are just dying to know if you are a<br />&nbsp;""SOUL PATROLLER"" or if you ""Caught the ""McPheever"" "". We'll hopefully find out Tuesday or&nbsp; Wednesday if&nbsp; the hansome&nbsp; 42 year old actor is a Member of ""The Soul Patrol"" or not..lets hope he is and if he's gonna be in the audience either night or both nights.<br /><br />If&nbsp; anyone is asking ""What is the Soul Patrol""? it is a&nbsp;group of Fans who followed Taylor Hicks through his journey on ""Idol"" and outside of ""Idol"".&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe there should be a loyal fanbase for Rob Lowe known as ""The ""Lowe"" Patrol""&nbsp; (lol) ...we'd be pledging our love, loyality and support in whatever the good looking actor does..besides looking perfectly flawless everytime...*guh* who is all with me on this..some one should start a community called ""The Lowe Patrol"" ...that doesn't sound half bad...maybe I should start a group..named that...!!(heehehehe *squee* lol)<br /><br />I&lt;3 Rob Lowe!! and I &lt;3 Taylor Hicks!!<br /><br /><br />well I gotta go!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Peace , Love, Lowe and&nbsp; Soul!!<br /><br />bye for now!! Love to hear from ya'll soon!!<br /><br />~*Casey*~(aka rlfanatic4ever)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />"

"event","<P>well it's has been awhile since i updated my LJ!!) there hasn't been much going on in my life really lately. I 'm really tired and feeling achy..so i can't be on much longer. I don't have any Rob updates for everyone this time as i speak..but don't worry I will keep everyone posted as will my pals at Rob Daily&nbsp; will keep you all informed about Rob. I am so having&nbsp;""Thought Block"" right now.. any how. Rob had a blast at&nbsp;""Sundance"" grabbing all the freebies that stars like him enjoy getting at&nbsp;parties like that. Keep in mind Rob's Birthday is coming up&nbsp;(March 17th) so mark your calendars ..also ""Thank You For Smoking"" comes out that same&nbsp;day as well..*sweet* so do something Rob-Related that day...!!&nbsp;also have fun doing so. </P>
<P>here's a&nbsp; ""Shirtless"" pic of Rob....*woah* *g*</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.geocities.com/holywdbnd/roblowe563.jpg""></P>

<P>I also added another pic..but sadly it's behind a cut...and not shirtless(lol) :(&nbsp; </P>
<P>But I think its rather cute... i hope ya'll can get to this pic alright..this is my first time using an LJ cut..so bear with me!!)</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""sexy Rob""><BR>&lt;img src=http://www.geocities.com/holywdbnd/roblowe539.jpg&gt;</lj-cut><BR>*thats a pic from ""Stroke of Midnight"" or ""If The Shoe Fits""..* I wouldn't mind having Rob Lowe be my Prince Charming&nbsp; at all..because he's so hot, and perfect.. and did&nbsp; I mention he's hot!!) I wish he could ""Give Me Just One Night(Una Noche)""..and&nbsp;that he'll always be ""My Everything""(sheesh..i know it's kinda strange..that&nbsp;two 98 Degrees&nbsp;songs come to my mind..and my fave of the 2 is the glittering ballad ""My Everything""&nbsp;...that song is soo beautiful and reminded me of Rob for an unknown reason)</P>
<P>example lyrics: "" You're the breath of life in me..the only one that can set me free./ You have made my soul complete for all time"" </P>
<P>&nbsp;chorus: You are My Everything/ Nothing your love can bring/ My Life is yours alone / the only love i have ever known/ your spirit pulls me through/ when nothing else can do/ every night i pray on bended knee that you'll always be ""My Everything"". </P>
<P>**If you don't have that song ..download it... or if you don't know what album its on i'll tell ya..that song can be found on 'Revelation(2000)' and 98 Degrees ""The Collection""(2002). It's a great song...it almost makes me cry everytime i hear it. because its a beautiful song.</P>"

Congrats to Keith being named again as CMA Male Vocalist of the Year&nbsp; and also being newly named CMA Entertainer of The Year.I can just imagine Rob Lowe singing what genre would you like to see him try if he did release an album...Country or&nbsp; Pop ..maybe mix multi genres.I am just listening to ""Be Here"" the multi platinum Album by&nbsp; Aussie/Kiwi native Urban. There is no Rob Lowe news to report..he'll be stateside December 17th ..after his run in&nbsp; ""AFGM""..and for all the Keith Urban Fans i reccomend buying ""Be Here"" and ""Livin' Right Now*""(*the concert film Dvd) ..I've been under alot of stress because a friend is leaving after this weekend and i am really gonna be sad for a while..I will get by..!!) later!! no Rob picture this time!! **)</P>"

Not even a week to my show... !! yay!! But on a lighter side when its the 17th of this month... We have one month till Rob is back state side..I am sad i don't have my passport or the money to go to London to see him in ""A Few Good Men""!! Knowing&nbsp; me i have a prior obligation to "" Kapers"" so i wouldn't have been able to go to London.. God ..I&nbsp; miss him... !! we'll be seeing him soon!!&nbsp; God I hope he was named <STRONG>""Sexiest Man Alive""</STRONG> he's been Long Overdue for that honor.. Not Many Guys after the age of 40 look that hot!! For&nbsp; a 41 year old actor who had two dramas backfire on him..I have a&nbsp; great feeling after Lowe returns from the UK.. there will ""Hopefully"" be a Project waiting for him to be a <STRONG>part</STRONG> of!! these are my thoughts and curiosities about the guy!! No matter what he does I still love him... for always i will be ""rlfanatic4ever""!!&nbsp; I Love You , Rob where ever you are!! </P>

"event","<P>Hey everyone,</P>
<P>I am tired as hell and i thought to post in my LJ!! Just listening to that Jessica Simpson song that brings Rob Lowe to Mind. Well nothing new is really going on lately .. I've been really busy with&nbsp; my life in general!! I haven't had a chance to watch My Rob Movies and what not. Last Night I sang my heart out at karaoke at a local establishment.. and i sang two other songs that brought Rob&nbsp; to my mind ""Looking Through The Eyes Of Love"" and ""I Honestly Love You"" when i sang those songs I felt like I was singing them to Rob alothough he's far away in London doing ""A Few Good Men"" .. God I miss him so badly..we all miss him like crazy.. I live eat and think about him constantly non stop.. I felt like he was there in spirit!!</P>
<P>**Hope to see him soon state side.. God I wish i had a way to be in London to see ""AFew Good Men"" .I don't even have a Passport ...oh well ..i am not gonna mull over this!! well we / i have to wait who People Magazine deems ""Sexiest Man Alive"" I/ we hope they name Rob it!! He is looking ""Sexy and Sleek as ever at 41..not many guys can still look good after they hit 40."".Though Lowe had some Floundering moments in his life..he's now a better person and can be taken serious as an actor and not just another ""Pretty Face"" in Hollywood and the world.***If I had a way to be in London I would be there..hell its Friggin' Rob Lowe ..the Hottest Man ever and should be named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" he's been long overdue for that honor!! he's *Yummy* and a **Dreamsicle**!!</P>

<P>**I can still have fantasies about My/ Our ""Sweetest Sin"" **&nbsp; who hasn't fantasized about&nbsp; this guy and about being married or Marrying &nbsp;him!! **Thats why ""Sex Fantasies"" are Great ..when its a fine guy like Rob Lowe he makes me wanna Masturbate"" or ""Fake an Orgasm"" or have a&nbsp; self inflicted ""Orgasm""!! Cant I just dream..for the love of Green M&amp;M's and Triple Shot Expresso's no wonder I Love Rob Lowe!!&nbsp; **uh yeah**&nbsp; there will be more of the more sexier Lowe in My next posting!!</P>
<P>Later kids and good night!! ""Sweet Dreams.."" Knowing Me My Dreams will always be Sweet..if Rob is Involved!! *Yummy*</P>

<P>Hi everyone,</P>
<P>Sexiness equals greatness in my&nbsp; book!! Especially Rob Lowe ..is a compassionate guy who overcame trials in his lifetime..including losing a loved one to Cancer* (* His Mom Barbra lost her battle in&nbsp; 2003&nbsp; shortly after Thanksgiving), and leaving ""The West Wing"" to do&nbsp; other projects like a few made for tv films and&nbsp; two ill fated dramas for two different networks*(*NBC and CBS) since for a couple years the Blue eyed hottie has been outspoken about Cancer Research&nbsp; especially .. with Cancer Patients who had troubles with Chemo Treatments..what really scared the 2 time Emmy Nominee was his father's boust with the treatments..and about the infections you can get&nbsp; from those treatments..Rob and his father Chuck launched By My Side a campaign to teach those who are being treated with Chemotheopy. In 2004&nbsp; Rob took part in the first ever ""World Lymphoma Awareness Day "" a Conference in which he spoke about&nbsp; his dad's battle with Lymphoma. Lowe&nbsp; is using his celebrity status to ""Change The World"" .&nbsp; Nowadays.. Lowe , 41 is currently in London starring in&nbsp; a revamp of the millatary drama penned by pal Aaron Sorkin ""A Few Good Men"",and will not be state side till Mid December from what i heard&nbsp; December 17th. I think People Magazine is overrated in who they pick for ""Sexiest Man Alive"" If there is a way to voice opinions on who is&nbsp; named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" If anyone out there agrees with me ..That&nbsp; Rob Lowe should be named ""Sexiest Man Alive""&nbsp; say I Do!! Even If we email on online Petition to voice our thoughts.. please someone get on the ""Future "" of&nbsp; Rob being named ""Sexiest Man Alive"" is in your&nbsp; hands!!&nbsp; I trust you be heard and Stand Tall!! and Stand Proud!!<IMG style=""WIDTH: 281px; HEIGHT: 203px"" height=209 src=""http://blackandwhiteincolor.photosite.com/~photos/tn/18834_1024.ts1098043255369.jpg"" width=371><IMG style=""WIDTH: 306px; HEIGHT: 201px"" height=722 src=""http://blackandwhiteincolor.photosite.com/~photos/tn/16045_1024.ts1097105226565.jpg"" width=1024><IMG style=""WIDTH: 311px; HEIGHT: 491px"" height=705 src=""http://blackandwhiteincolor.photosite.com/~photos/tn/13444_1024.ts1096039772276.jpg"" width=1024><IMG style=""WIDTH: 357px; HEIGHT: 491px"" height=686 src=""http://blackandwhiteincolor.photosite.com/~photos/tn/16029_1024.ts1097105225653.jpg"" width=589><IMG style=""WIDTH: 185px; HEIGHT: 298px"" height=1021 src=""http://blackandwhiteincolor.photosite.com/~photos/tn/21449_1024.ts1102441193386.jpg"" width=282>* Pics of This Man is worth a Million words*&nbsp; *Guh*</P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#993399 size=4>Hey , I know i have my own journal..now i finally came to my senses to post something in it!! well ..my 4th of July was just great!! and I am counting down the days till ""Beach Girls"" Premires on Lifetime!! I'm soo excited!! Earlier this evening i was watchin and taping ""Nick and Jessica's Tour of Duty"" on ABC!! There was nothing on and my little brother went with a couple friends to see some fireworks!! I stayed home with my dog and cats and watched Nick and Jessica!!! I tried watching ""The West Wing"" July 4th Marathon on Bravo .. the episodes they were showing are the ones with Josh Malina*(* the snotface who replaced Rob Lowe's character on that show) So I didn't watch that!! If that show is ever on I hope there are some episodes with Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn!! </FONT></P>

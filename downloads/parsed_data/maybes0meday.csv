"event","hey guys.. i'm waiting to go out so i decided to update and waste some
time.. life has been pretty good, busy as always. i went to providence
last saturday and loved it more than ever. i'm so so excited to go. i
seriously loved everything about it..i ran into a few people i know who
might go there also so i'm really excited :-) i just hope i like it as
much as i think i do, next year.. and that i don't get a wierdo
roommate. every day i can't believe that we're graduating and
everyone's leaving. i'm so sad, especially about erin probably going to
tampa. i hope you read this loser!! i'm going to florida w/ er on
monday till thursday. we're going to look at tampa (grr) and then to
ft. myers to stay with her aunt. frank is going the same time as us so
hopefully we'll hang out :-) last saturday we all went to long beach to
drink.. not a good idea. we miss you john! it's gunna be a long two
weeks without ya. after our fun ended we still had an awesome time just
hanging out with everyone.. on wednesday we all went to lido during the
day. it was so awesome almost our whole grade was there and not in
school. at first it was kinda cloudy but then it got really nice &amp;
i got burnt for the first time this year haha so exciting. ummm what
else. oo still can't wait for prom, i'm so happy everything worked
out..it's gunna be awesome&lt;3 i'm getting a new digital on sunday
hopefully so then i'll be able to take pictures again..it's been way
too long. sorry for the randomness of this entry. i hope everyone has
an awesome break and the weather's not terrible up here. oh last thing,
ap stats is the worst class ever and if anyone reads this who might
take it next year.. dont!!

<br>
i love this weather! <br>
and everything else lately. <br>
senior year really is amazing. everyone is coming back together and
friends and i love it. i'm finally coming to realize who are my true
friends and appreciating them so much more than ever before.&lt;3<br>
<br>
friday night started with us preing at erin's with her grandpa
upstairs. the guys came a few at a time until everyone was there &amp;
we got so loud playing never ever and telling the funniest stories ever
that gpa realized how many people were actually there, so we left and
went to annemarie's. thank you so much for this weekend! it was so much
fun. she had us all over two nights in a row. lots of other people were
there, it was so awesome being with everyone. especially you, and
sarah!! times ten&lt;3<br>
on saturday i went out to lunch with the girls to chili's then to
anne's for a little. so much fun being with you guys, as always. <br>
at night melissa, tina, liz, michaela &amp; i went to erica's sweet 16.
it was kinda weird being the oldest&nbsp; but we had so much fun. we
even got a candle.. the 16th!! she's so cute&lt;3 we left a little
early &amp; i went back to annemarie's again. everyone was there again,
and i could go on for a while with inside jokes but janet would really
kill me. so i'll end now haha<br>
<br>

<P>i'm definitely going to providence. i'm SO excited. i realllly can't wait to go away. i love everyone so much, but i've been waiting for this for so long. does anyone know anyone else who's going there? hmm i cant wait</P>
<P>i know high school is all about growing up and changing. but it's so sad how some people drift and change so much. once we used to think we could never live without each other.. then the next second you're barely saying hi to each other. the saying ""best friends forever"" is so annoying because it's so not true. ugh i just wish everyone could be friends and normal and nothing had to change at all. i know that's unrealistic. i have my little picture in my mind of everyone coming back from college and being friends again..but who's to say that will actually happen. grr so many memories and everything we've been all been through together. that's just life i guess. </P>
<P>sorry for the randomness.. i'm trying to kill time</P>
<P>oh sorry one more thing. ap stats should die. seriously. wtf. it's third quarter. i'm a senior. i do not care about anything anymore. especially stats!! ugh i wanna drop it so bad but my mom would never let me, and ""colleges will withdraw your acceptances."" ughhh </P>
<P>on a lighter note... &lt;3 </P>"

take a euro test which was really gay. laur erin sarah and i went to
panera for lunch. we didnt have that much time but it was really
fun..&nbsp; after school erin and i went to best buy and wal mart
because we had absolutely nothingg to do and she didnt have to
babysit.. then we went to the gym with melissa &amp; corey. we were all
excited for kickboxing but the instructor girl couldnt make it because
of the roads which sucked but oh welll. this weekend should be really
good.. i can't waittt&nbsp; hopefully something like last :-)<br>

"event","hey guys.. i havent updated in a long time so i guess it's time i do.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;i'll start w/ february break- liz and i took the train down to
baltimore on thursday. we almost missed the amtrack and were running
through penn station w/ our huge vera bradley bags and uggs and
northfaces and looked like real snobs not knowing what we were doing
haha with everyone laughing at us of course..it was funny tho. we took
a cab to loyola where robbie threw a surprise bday party for liz in his
dorm. it was really cute. we ate wings &amp; bagels from home and
watched oc and played beirut then went out to a bar in baltimore. it
was so much fun, until i drank too much and got really sick the next
day. when i felt better robbie took me and liz on a tour of loyola and
i absolutely loved it and now i really want to go there. if i get in
:-/. i really really hope i do. and i really hope i go with danielle!!
that would be so awesome.. later that night my dad picked me up &amp;
we went down to my aunt's house an hour away from loyola. the next day
i woke up really sick so i couldn't visit matt or my cousin. i was sick
for the whole week it sucked a lot. by friday i felt better so i went
to the city w/ annie and lauren. we went to this pub like place for
lunch then i met up with kathy and shannon and a few of their friends
and went up to carmel for the night. we visited danielle then went to
justin's and george's the next day. it was so much fun. i was so happy
to see them. i miss you guys so much. :-(. my cousin came home with me
and spent the day &amp; went out to dinner at orchid. at night i went
to jimmy's with anne &amp; lauren. then work the next day. that was my
vacation. it sucked being sick but wasn't terrible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;this weekend was by far the best since summer probably. friday
night was the senior dance. it was soo much fun. i think almost every
single person there was drunk it was so funny. the skits were funny and
some were cute but i thought they took up way too much time. by the
time they were over, the dance was over. it kinda stunk. i won an ipod
shuffle!! courtesy of mrs. russo, thanks nicole! then saturday i went
prom dress shopping w/ anne and erin and got extremely depressed
because i can not fit into <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">anything.</span> i have the
most demented body in the world and i hate it so much. i have noo clue
what i'm going to do. but w/e. then we went to erin's to pre. kevin
picked us + lauren up to go to dan spieler's. everyone from our school
was there, all grades. it was awesome until assholes decided to punch
holes in the wall so we had to leave. everyone went from there to katie
jordan's which was really fun too, until the same thing happened
again.. we have some realll winners in our grade. then we went to taco
bell w/ a bunch of people then finally home late. today i slept really
late then went to work. i hate working but i love being there. it's so
much fun &amp; i love everyone who i work with. <br>
<br>
where am i going to college? i have noo clue. i got into mt. st.
mary's, scranton, and catholic so far. i'd go to catholic if i didnt
get into providence or loyola.. but i dont want to go to the others. so
i'm just gunna wait. i can't believe that we're actually leaving, and
so soon. i'm really excited but after this weekend i realized how sad
it's gunna be leaving everyone.<br>
<br>
..prom. ive already complained about my inability to fit into anything.
im gunna go to the gym like everyday (yea right) so maybe i'll be able
to find something.&nbsp; but luckily i kinda know who i'm gunna go with
which is a plus. i know we'll have a good time like always but i just
reallly want to be with my friends. and i really want that to work out.
i hope we can all be together. <br>
<br>
i have lots of pictures from friday but my digital is broken and i need
a new one. anyone have any suggestions? i'm gunna get a new one soon
but i dont know what kind. <br>
also.. this is really random, but does anyone have an extra TI-83 i can
buy off of someone or something? i'm kinda desperate. ap stats is the
death of me. and greg daly borrowed mine and&nbsp; gave me his which is
broken w/out a cover.<br>
<br>
everyone has pictures of this weekend up on webshots, check em out. <br>
thanks guys for an amazing much needed weekend&lt;3<br>"

<br>
i dont know why but i'm in such a good mood. i can't even remember the
last time i was actually really happy. i dont have a reason to be happy
either. i practically failed my euro and stats midterms. i <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">never</span>
pay attention in stats and i can't find my glasses so i cant even see
the board if i wanted to. i know im a dork. but yeah, so today after
school i went to bistro w/ melissa and tina anne and pete came to meet
us there. all because i was hungry. it was fun then tina anne and i got
our nails done. anne made friends with seventh graders. the guy who did
tina's nails was gay with the other nail guy and told me not to have
mine done by this girl but i had to anyway so they came out bad. then
this girl who had no eyebrows and a fake everything on her body told me
to have them fixed but i wouldnt because i was scared so it became this
huge thing and the guys were like dont ever go to her but the girl
wouldnt fix them for me. so my nails are just messed up but oh well.
then i went to the gym with melissa and erin met us a little later for
kickboxing. it was so tiring but so much fun. so now i'm here. my mom's
really sick. she hasnt been to work since last thursday. i think she
has the flu or something like it but it stinks bc i hate seeing her
like that. i miss ali. and sarah. so much.&nbsp; i had so much fun with
anne and tina today. i love them a lot. <br>

"event","Wait for the boy who pursues you, the one who will make an ordinary moment seem magical, the kind of boy who brings out the best in you and makes you want to be a better person. Wait for the boy who will be your best friend, who will drop everything to be with you at any time of the day no matter what. Wait for the boy who makes you smile, like no other boy can. Wait for the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats and have no make-up on, but appreciates it when you get all dolled up for him. Most of all wait for the boy who will put you at the center of his universe because obviously, he's at the center of yours.

<P><FONT size=1>yesterday was homecoming so we had breakfast at evan's then went to the school and to town for the parade. everyone was pissed about the really ugly pants but we still did okay. we made our way to the school for the game where the music wasn't working so no one could hear when it started and it was just a big disaster. but oh well it was still fun. after that lauren and i went out to dinner with robbie and mike. it was awesome seeing them, it's been so long. then we all came here to pre &amp; mike dropped us at tommy's where like our whole kickline team + school was. it was awesome. happy birthday corey! and melissa who's bday is today!!! after tommy's we went to megan's for a little wihle then walked home with the girls. the whole day was so much fun but now i feel so sick and have to go to work in three hours. blah. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>this year is so awesome already, i can't wait for the rest of it. i love being a senior. it's weird at times looking down the halls and only seing people younger, but we're growing up. a lot of people have changed and are changing for the better, some for the worst but what can u do. my only semi-hard classes are ap euro &amp; stats. euro isn't hard it's just so much work and stats isn't hard yet but supposedly it gets kinda tough but whateverr. i started dancing again &amp; im really happy about that. our first football game is on saturday for kickline-- come watch us!! hopefully we wont suck <EM>that </EM>bad.. our coach's son choreographed this routine and it's reallyy gay but we changed some of it so it's not too too bad. but yay most exciting thing so far- <STRONG>i got my braces off</STRONG> finallyyy</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=1>tonight started out w/ ali erin lauren &amp; i driving to find tina marissa corey anne and davo drinking at meadow. we were supposeed to meet up with them but we saw cop cars and didn't so we got 40's for ourselves and drove past them getting tickets like 5 times. it was so scary but good times. when they finally got out of the cop situation we all met up at bogarts. it was weird tonight bc everyone is leaving for college and hardly anyone was there. it was sad but still fun. i want to leave right now for school it sucks we have to still be here while everyone's gone but hopefully this year will be awesome. i love you guys more than anything&lt;33</FONT></P>"

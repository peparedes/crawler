I wouldn't think so much the people that really know me, but most people are kind of supprised I don't like olives (ALERGIC = BAD), that I like anime but don't like DBZ (c'mon, it's giant space monkeys trying to destroy/save the world with super kung-fu.), or that I don't like Metallica (I like three songs out of HOW many albums?). As far as books go, I have a tough time. normally if I read a book and it really sucks, it's forever blocked out of my mind. Although for being a King fan, Desperation sucked (Steve, what were you thinking?!)."

"event","*huge sigh of relief...* The kitty and kittens are safe. hooray!!! but backtracking for anyone who has no idea what I'm talking about...

at work, over the last few weeks, we've had a cat that has been coming inside from the apartment complex we live at across the street. She was a kitten when we first moved in about six months ago, we fed it a few times and it was the cutest kitty in the world! But i digress.. but it was coming inside to see everyone and be petted and fed, but we were always careful to put her back outside so she would not be noticed by the prince of darkness who rules the first shift. A week or so ago we noticed she was pregnant, and we were trying to find a home for her before she had the kittens or was found out by first shift and animal control was called.  Things got kind of dicey last night when she started having her kittens inside one of the shop walls. we couldn't find anywhere outside that the kittens would be safe, and if she was put out for the night, they wouldn't survive. we were going to leave her in the wall to have her kittens and hope she didn't come out in the morning before one of the guys could get by to check on her, but we were found out by the second shift social climber (read: kiss ass) and had to put her out to keep us from possibly being fired. not cool. what happened next has completely endeared one of my coworkers to me, he took her towards the back gate, rather loudly complaining about the ""damn cat"" until our resident gremlin seemed satisfied and left, then somehow after everyone left he got her back inside and put her in the wall with one of her kittens that had already been born. Awesome. we were lucky enough this morning that the first shift guy that found her had his daughter with him for some reason and she was instantly enthralled by cute kitty mind control, so she will be coming in every day to feed them and make sure they're alright and to take them home with the mommy when they are big enough. This way, I don't have to worry about the crack head neighbors they are supposed to belong to forgetting to feed them again. :)"

"event","Almost time to walk across the street and go to work... I bet most of you can't say that and be serious. :) Anyways, as bizarre as it is to look out the window and stare at the loading docks in the back of the shop, for us, right now, it works.(we just have really big, dark curtains in the living room.) we only have to deal with expenses from one car right now, which is fantastic, and my commute to work is fine regardless of highway traffic. :)  

I decided last night that before I let all the drama in Hell(work, same thing) make me a basket case, I'm going to try to adopt a very zen attitude towards all the crap that goes on. It's kind of amusing from a long distance point of view actually. You have grown men who gossip worse than a bunch of old ladies (my apologies to any gossiping old ladies, i couldn't think of a better comparison.) and the worst one is the floor supervisor. it would be funny if it wasn't so irritating. But anyway, as regarding the zen point of view, thank you Charlie Crews, They already think I'm a freak anyway, this shouldn't cause any additional problems. :)"

"event","Ugh. status check: work sucks, boss is evil, need chocolate. lots of chocolate. Moving on, ideas for t-shirts keep popping up, but lack of money for a standing inventory forces them to be stored on countless little notebooks for future reference. Really need to keep digital copies. To anyone interested, if you have a good idea for a shirt, lay it on me, I'm willing to work out some arrangement, either pay or barter. Going to Animazement in May, really need to have decent inventory by then, it makes the selling part much, much easier. 

In my defense I'm not really jaded so much as just really in debt."

"event","it seems that everything i post has to do with how stupid the people i run into are or somthing like that. but unfortunately, stupid people walk amongst us, in large numbers. i would think that when you present someone at a fast food restraunt with a coupon, you are planning on using said coupon for whatever heart-disease inflicting tidbit you order. apparently, arbee's doesn't train employees in coupon recognition or function. after trying three times to place my order, two roast beef sandwiches and a pepsi,  and i have a coupon. simple english,yes? apparently not. after finally giving my order twice more at the window, i handed the lady the coupon, only to be asked '' so you want to use this coupon?''. no of course not. stupid."

"event","heads up boys and girls, we have a future darwin award in the making. the week before i posted this, a high school near the machine shop i work at had an attempted takeover by a group of emo kids. apparently, really stupid emo kids. one of them told someone they were going to takeover the school the day before, ad the only thing they were armed with was a handful of knives. depressing. i'm still wondering if i should be disturbed that a bunch of delinquints managed to get knives into a school by taping them to their arms, but  the image of a handful of scrawny, pale kids with knives trying to subdue a few hundred students and teachers, an a security guard does kinda make me giggle."

"event","people are stupid.  not all people, just most. and not kinda stupid, really really really  presidential grade stupid.  people like this need to be fitted with the little doggy shock collars, so everyone with a brain can shock the shit out of them whenever neccesarry.  it's really for their own good you know.  or when that doesn't work, we feed them to pirhanas, big ones. thus once rid of most of the human race, the healing proccess can begin."

"event","It's been a while since my last post; work, job hunting, sloth, all that good stuff.  anyway, nothing incredibly earth-shattering has happened recently.  Although I have discovered something, the harder I try to find or make time to be with my girlfriend, the more shit i have to put up with from my parents and society in general.  it's like everyone walks around with this invisible asshole radar ontop of their heads that tells them where and when to be to piss me off the most and screw up my plans.  i firmly believe my parents and job have the super-sized version.  all that aside it's been a pretty good day so far, considering i've only been up for an hour and a half.  and at the moment i'm sitting beside a beautiful woman on the other computer listening to a very disturbing song i'd swear is about oral sex, or something."

"event","It's been a very stressful week.  between trying not to strangle my parents and trying to keep my car working with all the stuff it has wrong with it, and trying to find a new job, have time to see my girlfriend, and not go nuts; I feel like I have a little imp following me around, and whenever I think I've gotten everything organized, I get stabbed in the ass with a little pitchfork and I hear ""haha, you missed something, dumbass.""  aside from that it's been a fairly good couple of months.  I graduate this week (it's about damn time), I'm in a relationship with an amazing and beautiful woman (who's going to roll her eyes and tell me I'm full of shit when she reads this), and with luck I'll have a new better paying job by the end of the month (hallelujah!!) because anything beats a paycheck that bounces between $80 and $160 a week."

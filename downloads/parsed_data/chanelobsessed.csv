We all know you could see it very clear by the end of the night. Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, did you not try the dress on? Did you not know it was see through? Did you not know that you are supposed to wear a bra underneath?&nbsp;<br /><br />The first thing I want to know is why would you buy this dress when we have the most uglist color green (it looks like moss)&nbsp;ever! Second this is that shoes and clutch don't go. I like your butterfly pin so that you showed more skin but no the dress is just FUGLY!&nbsp;<br /><br />Please never wear something like this again. I mean girl I love you and all but why would you wear this? No wonder you got on the worst dressed list.<br /><br />By the way Jess is wearing Yves Saint Laurent I mean I love YSL but this dress was a fashion no go!<br /><br />My overall rating is 2/5 I like the butterfly pin and the jewlery but other than not its a huge NO!<br /><br /></font><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/chanelobsessed/pic/00006hsc/""><font size=""3""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""95"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/chanelobsessed/pic/00006hsc/s320x240"" /></font></a><br /><br /><font size=""3"">I love Chanel, but I hate the tights. Ok, so I understand if it was cold but if it wasn't then why would you wear this, honestly? I really like how you pulled this dress off is there was no tights at all. I don't really like the whole outfit at all but the shoes. The color of the dress doesn't go with your skin tone. If it was more pink I would like it. This peachy color doesn't really look good with your skin tone. I like the bow it cool (lol).&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall I think I am going to give this a 3/5 just because I like the dress but not with your skin tone and I hate the tights but I love the shoes!</font></p>"

"event","<p>Gemma Ward is my favorite Model, I don't know why she just is!<br /><br />How down to earth is Gemma?:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/chanelobsessed/pic/00001912/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""160"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/chanelobsessed/pic/00001912/s320x240"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/chanelobsessed/pic/000029pp/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""160"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/chanelobsessed/pic/000029pp/s320x240"" /></a><br />Look at that! Gemma is doing her own Make-up! Thats great!!&nbsp;<br /><br />I must admit thought that curling your own eyelashes isn't very down-to-earth because how do you expect a hair and make-up artist to do that? So I guess it isn't all the way down to earth!<br /><br />Anyway....I guess she is is still pretty but she just isn't that down-to-earth as I hoped, well not in this picture anyway.<br /><br />So as I said before that I love Johnny Depp! Sometimes he dresses awful though! Like this:<br /><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""160"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/chanelobsessed/pic/000034cw/s320x240"" /><br />Okay first of all why Johnny, just why? I hate seeing a man in platform dress&nbsp;shoes. The 70's or 80's are over my friend! Plus why do you have the chain hanging from your pants? Its just not good. Its a good thing you have a pretty damn good looking girlfriend Johnny.&nbsp;<br /><br />So the fact that the whole outfit is just awful I have to give you a&nbsp;low: 2/5 because I knocked off points because Vanessa is pretty.<br /><br />I don't want to cristise anymore. I like the way look but not how you dress.<br /><br />More awful dressed Johnny at <a href=""http://www.style.com/peopleparties/search/thumb/person1013"">http://www.style.com/peopleparties/search/thumb/person1013</a><br /><br /><br /></p>"

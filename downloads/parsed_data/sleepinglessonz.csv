"event","Nothing has changed too much in the past month or so.&nbsp; I have moved into my grandfathers house. 
Yeah, it's weird.&nbsp; 

The house is really a dream though right now. I couldn't ask for more.&nbsp; 


I really have realized i need to start cleaning up a bit. 
You never know the stink you get yourself into until you're knee deep. 
 Looking at what preventative steps i have taken to begin that path tonight makes the task at hand seems futile. 


We'll see.&nbsp; 

The cycle never stops, ends, or in many begging pleads, at least slows down."

"event","welp, here goes my first entry.<br /><br />I have so much to say and hope to get it out in this one little blank box.&nbsp; Good luck to me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up is hard to do, you know?&nbsp; When you were a kid you wanted it all, the money the cars, and houses.&nbsp; Everything seemed to be so easy to get in that child's eye.&nbsp; Now that everything is real, it is making everything else&nbsp; just as&nbsp; difficult to obtain.&nbsp; Allow me to elaborate.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While on the climb up the ladder to work towards getting an apt, working two jobs and maintaining a healthy social life is becoming harder and harder.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am one to think that you should play well harder than you work.&nbsp; I know that this is not the proper way to think at twenty two, but such is life and I really do believe i am set in my ways.&nbsp; If you do not pay attention to life, it passes right before you're eyes and you'll end up missing out.&nbsp; This past summer I have figured out what i want to do for the rest of my life and i have never been happier to work as hard as I need to to get to the final goal.  <br /><br />A big first step in the right direction.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have six years of schooling left to go through and I have no qualms with that.&nbsp; Alot of my friends right now are eager to get out off school and start life.&nbsp; Yes, i do wish the same for myself, but i also know that the position i am in right now is a hole i have dug for myself due to the, 'play harder' theory I have set for myself.&nbsp; I am ok with being done school at the age of 27.&nbsp; Well, maybe not <i>ok, </i>but it will set me up in a time in my life where I will be happy to start a new career and chapter for that matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did i mention what I want to go back to school for?&nbsp; No? Well I want to be and elementary school art teacher.&nbsp; I have my associates in photography and digital media from the newly formed 'Wilmington University'.&nbsp; After completing that adventure I realized I have a severe passion for photography, but just in a free lance aspect of the field.&nbsp; I have spent much of my life in love with journalism and photo journalism and thought to go back for my degree in that.&nbsp; I thought harder about it and couldn't come up with any idea of what this girl could do with herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Again here is where my theory comes into play.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the deck at our shore spot, I was drinking all day long talking to my mother about what I was going to do. &nbsp; After going through all of the jobs I had tortured myself with over the years we began talking to a long time friend.&nbsp; She is a grade school teacher downstate in Dewey and was actually my first grade teacher.&nbsp; She loves her job.&nbsp; I, at one time in my life, was a kindergarten teacher in the mornings and loved every second.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then it hit me:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not teach kids the one passion i have always had?<br /><br />I got superly, overly, drunkenly excited.<br /><br /><br />So, over all I have been happy in getting to where I am right now.&nbsp; I suppose.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, I have felt the overwhelming need to find someone to share all of this with.&nbsp; Most of you who care enough to read this probably get the jist of who i am and where i stand when it comes to relationships.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; I'm sorry, i don't know how to explain this with clear, un-creepy words.&nbsp;  <br /><br />I just get lonely in the fall.&nbsp; And after going through what I just went through, i just want something simple.&nbsp; Nothing heavy. <br /><br />Something honest.<br /><br />BLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAHBLAH<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I move in hopefully tomorrow!&nbsp; Everything seems to be in order and i really like the people at the new complex.&nbsp; Josh and I should be happy.&nbsp; I just cannot wait to get out and start something new for myself.&nbsp; Even just for a little bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm bringing Ziggy with me too.&nbsp; That excites me.&nbsp; I thought I was going to have give him away.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br /><br />Alrighty, i have a long day ahead off me tomorrow and should be shovin' off.<br /><br /><br />g'nite moon.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

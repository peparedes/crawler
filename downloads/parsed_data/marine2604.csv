"event","today is stressfull. i have to train these army idiots how to do their own jobs. they want to change everything we are doing and they have barely even seen a mortar attack yet. i hate when people who dont know what they are talking about suddenly think the are an expert because they are older or in this case outrank you. i have only 21 days left here though and i am so ready to be waking up next oto leah every morning like things were. we really have a great marriage and need time to enjoy it together. maybe i will actually be home for x-mas thids year too. 2005 will be better by far than last year."

"event","I swear, I listened to the whole Yellow Card CD Jay bought yesterday.. hella good music. Damn they like hella connect with me.. o_O..

<b>Yellow Card [Ocean Avenue]</b> song: ""Miles Apart""

<i>Now we've all grown up, Gone on and moved away. Nothing I can do about it, Nothing I can say.. To bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard, Looking back it all just seems so far.. So far away..

	We will be miles apart, I'll keep you deep inside You're always in my heart.. A new life to start, I may be leaving byt you're always in my heart...</i>

I think the reason I like that song, is because it kinda has to do with Ben, I mean.. he is still one of my best friends and I do miss him, but yano, there can never be that again and <b>I love Sammy now</b> yet, no matter what.. I won't forget and he will always be in my heart. I don't feel like posting the story of ""ben"" lol.. but if you know it, then you know it.. it really isn't as bad as some of you MIGHT be thinking.. god forbid that.

I don't know what I've been thinking about the past couple of days.. It's been really confusing. I'll post in here again later, if I feel the need to, bye all."

We'll be okay Sammy, we really will. Our little guardian angel will be back soon. Don't worry, I know your sad, so am I.

Hold on to the little bear, and the blanket, because I want them back soon. I have a good feeling about this Sammy. Don't worry we'll be fine. Oh and Emi said she loves you Sammy. ^_^

<P>I got my cable internet back!!! Funny story. You see, about 1 week ago, we had our cable internet shut off.

UGH! So they were telling us if we didn't pay we would get it shut off, so my mom got it shut off. -_- And well, we were planning on getting DSL, seeing as it's the next fastest thing, but until they could come out we were using AOL.. how the fuck do people use that slow ass shit!?!? omg. I could not even handle it, it took like 10 minutes to DL a fucking song!! Well, the next day.. our cable gets turned back on. o_O like out of NOWHERE.. so we're with cable for 2 more days and it gets shut off again. -_- WHATEVER, so we call the SBC company to get DSL ASAP. and we're stuck with gay ass hell AOL again, omg.. okay i'd rather just NOT go online anymore, fuck. So yeah then all of a sudden, our cable gets turned back on again yesterday, thank god man. LOL hopefully it stays, but I think now my moms just gonna pay the bill so I can have cable, coz' dial-up+AOL=FUCKING SUCKS MY ASS. So yeah, I get what I want this time. 'Bout time.

"event","why do things have to change? or come upon you unexpectedly? I hate uh.. everything.. god non-stop crying and being alone is NOT a good mix. Someone make everything all better.. please )=

<b>EDIT 12:31 p.m.:</b>

Yeah so I've been listening to some music.. The Used, Die Trying.. and yeah here's some songs that sum up the way i've been feeling.. -_-

<b>""Words that Kill""</b> -Die Trying

My world's on fire
My life's overwhelming
Just breathe
<i>You're on the next train to life without me</i>
Time had nothing left to show so we found out
A world on fire
A life overwhelming...

<u>Do you believe in the words you said to me
As you take away everything?</u>

<b>""Buried Myself Alive""</b> -The Used

you almost always pick the best times
to drop the worst lines
you almost made me cry again this time
another false alarm
red flashing lights 
well this time I'm not going to watch myself die
I think I made it a game to play your game 
and let myself cry 
I buried myself alive on the inside
so I could shut you out
and let you go away for a long time 

<strike>I guess it's ok I puked the day away</strike>
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
and if you want me back
you're gonna have to ask
nicer than that..

<b>""On My Own""</b> -The Used

see all those people on the ground
wasting time
i try to hold it all inside
but just for tonight
the top of the world
sitting here wishing
the things I've become
that something is missing
maybe I...
but what do I know 

and now it seems that i have found
nothing at all
I want to hear your voice out loud
slow it down
<b>without it all
I'm choking on nothing</b>
it's clear in my head
and I'm screaming for something
knowing nothing is better than knowing at all 

<b>""Greener With The Scenery""</b> -The Used

you took it back
how could you go and do something like that
my fingernail phase
worst has got the best of you
I ask you and I know I need to change
you took it back
you ripped my heart out of my then you put it back
I'm pulling my hair
I let you just a million times
I love you even though it isn't fair 

change
run we go around again in circles
play this game over again.

<b>""Pieces Mended""</b> -The Used

Stay the same
lie to me and try to say you never will.

<i>UGH! You suck, you messed me up! God I used to be fine.. before all this.. )=</i>

Those were just parts of songs that really fit me, like they were the lyrics that stood out to me, that's why there is hardly any ""bolding"" or shit. Goooodd.. someone save me, please? )=

<b>This needs to be over already. -_-</b>

XNOiSE l KiSSESx: Can you like save me? make everything better Hector.. )=
<i>Mectorine: you know if i could i wud id be all ""lets ditch""</i>
XNOiSE l KiSSESx: lol.. imma miss ""lets ditch"" )=

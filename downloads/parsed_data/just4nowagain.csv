So forget you ever thought it was me
Yea...

"event","He SOOO lied...and I KNEW he was lying...but now I know for a FACT.
So, I went out with my friend Melanie early on Saturday night.  By 8:00, I was already a little drunk, and I text messaged him.  Kind of funny, actually, I just wrote, ""already drunk...4 a good time call... ;)  He didn't call, and by 9 or 9:30, I was even more drunk, so I called him.  (not like he doesn't do it, too, sometimes).  Anyway, he answered with ""what's up drunk ass?"", so he'd gotten the message, but didn't call.  Still, obviously when I called, having read the msg. he KNEW I was drunk, and most likely knew why I was calling, so if he was 100% NOT interested, he wouldn't have answered the phone.  Well, when I talked to him, I asked him what he was doing, and he said nothing.  I said getting a drink, and he said no, I said yes, he was, he, still thinking I was implying that was what he was currently doing, again said no.  I said, well you should, and he mentioned that he was thinking about it, but he wasn't sure blah blah blah. 
So I was trying to convince him to go and have a drink.  Once he said no b/c ""it's not allowed""
A few times he said no b/c he wasn't going to go anywhere, he was just gonna take a shower and go to bed, and he didn't feel like going out, and he just wanted to stay home and be alone, blah blah blah.
What was that, about three different excuses?  If you're going to lie, stick to one.  It's more convincingt that way, and you're less likely to forget your lies later.
Fast forward to yesterday (incidentally...my birthday...which he seemed surprised to learn about, saying, ""today's your birthday??  Happy Birthday!!  I didn't know that.""  Um, YES, you did.  WHOLE different story, folks.)
So yesterday, we're talking, and (right in front of one of the other managers, actually, and a passing employee or two), he asks, ""Hey remember that band that was playing up there?"" (referring to a band that played at Bennigans up the road the ONE night HE ever asked ME to go out after work...and we made out, but I SOMEhow summoned the willpower to NOT sleep with him, b/c I'd already been feeling the ""drunken sex intentions only"" vibe from him at that point in the game), and I, a little shocked he said it RIGHT OUT LOUD, was just like, ""Yea..?""
He mentioned that they were playing at Genova's (the bar by his house he goes to quite a bit...that I've been to a few times) the other night.
Two things were wrong with that statement.  The first being that he made it obvious to ANYone who cares to pay attention, (and believe me, for lack of excitement in their own lives, these people hang on EVERY physical and verbal exchange we make), that I had been somewhere that he was to know about the band...and that I knew what Genova's was...b/c it was said in the way you'd say ""Friday's,"" or ""Applebees"" as if the other person just KNOWS what it is.  I wouldn't KNOW what a local bar by his house was.  Dumb ass.
The second problem?  It was Monday.  I knew that Friday night he'd gone out with his friend Dave.  Over by where Dave lives.  Not by Genova's.  AND, he and Dave don't ever GO to Genova's.  They go other places.  SUNDAY night...he'd called (to see if I was mad at him...points for that...though I'm pretty sure he was already a little drunk, but whatever) b/c I kind of hung up on him on Saturday night, and I didn't talk to him AT ALL on Sunday when Chris and I went in to eat, (so she could see him, really).  Points again, for even noticing that I SPECIFICALLY didn't talk to you. Well, Sunday when I talked to him, I asked him where he was, b/c I could tell he was out (1. just b/c he called, 2. b/c he called twice within an hour and 10 minutes, and 3. b/c I could hear background noise.)  Anyway, he was out watching the Maryland game some place near his house...he told me where, but I can't remember.  All I remember is that it was NOT Genovas.  THAT I would remember. 
Anyway, common sense says, ""When, Saturday night?""
And dumbass says, ""Um...Yea, I guess it was Saturday,"" as he tries to remember what the day was.
And the next morning, a pissed off April says (to herself, not him), ""FUCKING ASSHOLE.  HE TOTALLY was lying about not going anywhere on Saturday night.""  Granted, I KNEW he was lying...but to KNOW he lied.  
And it's not as if he's not interested AT ALL...b/c then why would he have called to see if I was mad the next day?  He would have just been happy that I was mad and he didn't have to worry about me talking to him or calling him or something.  So it's not like that.
It's like this:  He's a shithead.
It's like this:  He's a man.
It's like this:  Fuck him.

I'M ONLY HAPPY WHEN I'M WITH YOU
I ONLY FEEL GOOD WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU
AND I'M A MESS WHEN YOU DON'T CALL ME
CALL ME AT NIGHT
WHERE DID YOU GO
WHERE DID YOU GO
AND DID YOU THINK OF ME 

IT'S HARD TO BREATHE
AND MY HEART'S SINKING
I'M SLIPPING FAST
AS I AM REACHING FOR YOU
IT'S GONNA HURT CAUSE

CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER NIGHT
WITHOUT YOU HERE BESIDE ME

I want to review my kisses
On every inch of your body
I want to reveal my secrets
That only you should know
I feel all this pain inside me
That only your lips can make better

So you won't forget that you are mine

DON'T WANNA CARE 
MORE THAN YOU DO
Don't want to be the one
Who's out in the rain
DON'T WANNA GET THAT 
CALL WHERE YOU SOUND SO COLD
So far away, so far away
Like the distant roll of thunder

Its a cave in the darkness
And I'm lost inside you
Don't go

I feel like a childless mother
Longing to hold her baby
If I could review my kisses

"event","So today was ABSOLUTELY F-ing BEAUTIFUL!  I would live for every day to be JUST like today...with a couple of beach months in the summer, a cool month mid-autumn (Halloween-Thanksgiving), and a snowy month for December (Thanksgiving).
Anyway...
I went into work early (sounds dumb, given the previous observation), however, I knew that at 4:00 (my SCHEDULED time), if someone came in to pick up, or if they were letting someone go, I would end up wanting to leave, b/c it was so nice out.  HOWEVER, if I got there EARLY, and was already taking tables, ideally, I'd be motivated to stay.  So I did.  Of course, from 2-3:30 was pretty slow (when I first got there), so I only had 3 tables and made about $30...but whatever, 30 bucks is 30 bucks, and I finished the day with $230 after tip-out...for working 2-11.  (9 hours, for those not proficient in the mathematics dept.)
I'm happy with that.
Ray was Ray.
Started out really blah today...even a little snippy several times.  When I first walked in, I said hi to him (he was in the back), and he said hi, too, then it went like this:
Me:  How was your day off?
Him:  Good (see how he's a great conversationalist!?!)
Me:  What'd you do?
Him:  I played golf.
Me:  Really?
Him:  Yep.

Wow.
A true wonder some other girl hasn't snatched him up already.  I'm shocked his ex won't take him back.
Actually, I'm making him sound completely pathetic and boring, when, in actuallity, he normally is NOT, which is PRECISELY why I was slightly irritated at such a lack of willingness to actually PARTICIPATE in the conversation.
It may have been bad timing, too, though, b/c they were a little bit busy.  Not very, though.
Well, in any case, later he kind of got a little bit of an attitude about a couple of things, and finally, at one point, I think I asked for something, I don't remember, and I didn't like the snappy response I got from him, so I said, 
""EWW...that attitude you've got?  SERIOUSLY gotta get rid of it"" 
I didn't know, but as it turned out, this other girl, Erinn, heard me, and she totally started laughing, which led him to really realize what I'd said, and he said something about it not being directed toward me (it almost sounded apologetic...or at least the closest I'll ever get to it from him), and so I looked at him, and as I did, he looked back at me and I caught the ""I think no one else is looking right now, and I have a second to look you in the eye and flirt like we always do"" look.  His cute look.  His ""make me like him even when all I want to do is gouge his eyes out and hate him"" look.  His look that doesn't seem to stop for 5 minutes, and in reality, probably does last at least a good 10 or 15 seconds (longer than they say is supposed to be ""comfortable"" to maintain eye contact with someone, and DEFINITELY long enough for people to think something if they were paying any kind of attention whatsoever.)
Anyhow, it made me feel a lot better when he gave me that look, b/c I didn't feel like we were totally disconnected like I have the past few days.
AND a little bit later he commented to me as we both were walking into the walkin (me first, this time, so he can't think I followed him in there!), that he got a new watch for me to break yesterday.  This in reference to the fact that SWEARS IIIII broke his last watch.  That was actually the first night we hooked up, and it was how I got him to hook up, b/c I had taken his watch away from him b/c he wouldn't quit worrying about what time it was and having to be at work in the morning.  When we got to the next bar, I purposely left it in my car.  When we were leaving, he needed his watch, and I purposely took a while finding it, so that everybody else would leave while I was looking for it (a PERFECTLY executed plan on my part, I must add), and then joking refused to give it back to him for a while, until, finally, he eventually went to reach for it, grabbed my arm and twisted me around...looked at me for a second ALMOST like he was going to kiss me...didn't, then a minute later did almost the same thing...and suddenly the next thing I knew I WAS kissing him!  YAAAY for me!)
WELL, ladies and gentleman, Memory Lane will be temporary closed due to several unseen dangerous curves down the road.  Please detour to The Present.
Annnnd we're back.
So, I mentioned that obviously I didn't break his watch (as has been my position all along) but I really liked that he mentioned the watch.  It was something I'd actually forgotten about...but it reminded me of that first night. 
He also mentioned while on the line that he was hung over, or something like that, and I said something about that being where his attitude came from, but either way, it meant that he got drunk last night, and STILL DIDN'T call.  What does THAT mean!?!?!?
<freaks out>
Later I said something to him about drinking playing golf or something, and he said he actually didn't have one drink while playing...they played golf, and figured while he was out by the outlets, he'd stop and get a new watch, and then after they drank, and he only had like, 7 beers, or something like that.  I asked why then, he was hung over, and he reminded me he hasn't been drinking much lately, and then also added that he did a shot.  (he CANNOT take shots...that's how I got him drunk that first night...lol)
Anyway, I suddenly find myself freaking out, wondering where they went (it was him and his friend Dave), and what they did, and if he met any girls that he even found attractive there, and WHY HE DIDN'T CALL EVEN WHEN HE WAS DRUNK.
Tonight at work we had a table walk in at 10:20.  We had to take them (even though we close at 10:00, b/c Cindy forgot to lock the door).  It was fine, though, it was 2 guys, and they were really cool, and very apologetic, and even said they'd go.  Something told me to make them realize it was ok to stay, whereas normally I'd be like, ""ok"".
Turns out they're here from NJ/NJ on business (they work for Micros, as restaurant computer company...we used to use them) and were looking for some place to go.  One of them was pretty cute, though, sadly, not tall enough, and we told them they should go to Nottinghams, since they're staying at the Wellesley practically right next door, and that's where we all go.
Well, they ended up asking if we were going to go, so this girl Melanie that I work with and I decided we'd go out with them, and we did.
Why is this good?  A few reasons.
1. They'll probably be back while they're here, so maybe I can find a way to get people talking...even purposely mention the one guy is cute.
2. They mentioned hanging out again b/4 they go back...which isn't until Friday.  So I can make plans with them, and then CONVENIENTLY mention it to some other friends. Maybe I can find a way to get people talking...
3.  Tomorrow I can tell the story of the table that came in that we went out with.  With the cute guy.  Staying at the hotel by Nottie's.  Maybe I can get people talking...and when they think something more happened, as they obviously will, based upon the setup of the story, I can deny it, b/c nothing DID happen, but make it sound like I'm denying it like something really did happen...you all know the tone of voice bad liars use...that's the one I'm talking about!

The whole point is to make sure Ray catches wind of it.  ESPECIALLY to hear that I think this guy is pretty cute, we hung out b/c their hotel was right there by the bar, and we're going to hang out on ""x"" night.
EVEN BETTER...PURPOSELY ask Ray to call me on whatever night that is.  Then, ask the guy to say LOUDLY in the background when he does, ""Honey, who is it?"".  I'll lie and say to the guy that it's my brother, and I just want to fuck with him, b/c I don't want ANY ideas (especially if Melanie comes along), that it's someone from work.  And since tonight we just had a discussion about me freaking my brother out with the thought of me with another guy...hey mike, where did this green lei come from!?!  haha...it would make TOTAL sense to them, and I think they'd go along with it.

Pathetic, I know.
And I'm not 12, I know.
I'm also not a stalker.
Doesn't mean I've never gone on-line to ""Google"" a guy.  (p.s. I thought I was alone on this one.  Turns out it must be more common than I think, b/c Cosmo mentions it ALL the time, so OBVIOUSLY there are many girls out there who do it, which basically just means it must be a girl thing...not a weird thing!)

I have to open the store tomorror at 10 am.  ugh.  I HATE opening.  Oh well.  Ray will be there.  Hopefully I can continue the fact that I'm losing my voice (as is always the case where there is alcohol, smoke, loud talking, or any combination thereof.  I had only one drink, but I guess that's all it took.  Anyway, if I am still struggling with my voice, combined with a comment about being tired, ESPECIALLY if Cindy works (b/c she knows we went out with them), that would lead to questions by him, I'm sure of it!
Why does he make me want to play games?  I don't even WANT to, actually.  He just makes me HAVE to.  
It actually felt good to go out with those guys tonight.  Just to know that I had the option of going out with some other totally random guys that I had just met.  Even though I knew I didn't have any further interest in either of them (though, I gotta admit, the one TOTALLY COULD have appeal drunk...think a little bit Colin Farrell, but minus the chain smoking...actually minus the smoking PERIOD...and minus the ""F-bomb"" every other word"".  Just not tall enough is all.  But, then, as we all know, I do lower my standards when I'm drunk.  And Ray doesn't know what he looks like anyway.
To quote a country singer whom I never did think saw the fame or recognition she deserved, (Mindy McReady)
 
""A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to gettin' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.""

And such words those are to live by~

"event","So I conceived the most (in my imagination) wonderfully devised, carefully thought-out, master-minded plan last night, which, right up until the last minute, I'd whole-heartedly indended to carry out.
Thankfully, I didn't.
Long-story shorter...I'd planned to say (in many more words) via a voicemail to Ray that he was really shitty and basically f*ck him, and I don't need the stress of him and this.  Then I was going to call back today, and apologize for the ""drunk"" phone call, (though, truthfully, I'd had no intentions of being even slightly intoxicated when I planned to make the call), and tell him I didn't mean what I said, but he should ""know what it's like to say things you don't mean when you're drunk"", since he does it all of the time. (RE: his admittance that maybe he said we should get to know each other and see where this goes when he was drunk...don't EVEN get me started on the night at the movies when he was stone cold sober and responded that ""It's not over.  It's just a couple of weeks,"" when I mentioned that I didn't want to leave that night b/c then ""It will be over"". grrr.)
ANYway, I did so, after he was a COMPLETE SH*Thead at work, though he really didn't do anything to me, but I guess just the fact that I wasn't enough to make him happy made me upset.  Either way, he commented to one of the kitchen guys, right in front of me, when asked what was wrong, that he just wanted to ""Punch a f*cking woman.  And I have a specific one in mind, too.""
OBVIOUSLY I knew he was talking about HER, but I was PISSED, b/c I thought that the reason he wanted to punch her was b/c once again one of his attempts to get her back either just completely failed, or went unnoticed, and that made him mad.  Which made ME mad that he would be complaining about that in front of me.
SO, I was pissed like usual, and I gave up my shift, b/c I couldn't work with him.
I went over to Chris's, where I proceeded to rant until my face turned blue, and then a little longer, and she was riding the wave with me over John and their dilemma.  After that we ate at a little diner (a lot of food, too, by the way), and complained some more, then went home, and watched comedy central; though, actually, neither of us watched so much as we actually just stared listlessly at nothing and pretended to be so consumed with the t.v. that we had nothing to spark a conversation.  Truth be told...we both were to wrapped up in our relationship (or lack thereof) drama, and didn't feel much like talking, I don't think.
ANYway, I DID call him last night after I got home, but (AND VERY GRATEFULLY SO), I opted to call with a more friendly concerned tone.
After lightly pressing for a few moments, he finally told me that he was given a summons to appear in court.  She's taking him back to court for MORE child support.  They'd agreed mutually upon the current arrangement...which is $400/month...he gives her $200 every 2 weeks.  Now she wants $700 a month!  ABSURD!  For ONE child!!!  Anyway, sad as it is to see, maybe NOW he'll remember what a bitch she is and that he SHOULDN'T want to get back with her, and that even if he still WANTS to, she clearly does NOT.  I hope he doesn't end up having to pay that much...then it will be extra sweet...He'll not have to pay more...and STILL be reminded of how sh*tty she is!  He was definitely cussing her name YESTERDAY!  Wonder how badly he wants to be with her now!?!  
Anyway, we talked for about 10 or 15 minutes, and I told him I'd talk to him later.
Of course, I couldn't help trying to call him today, but, naturally, he didn't answer.  I left a simple voicemail, basically just saying that I was just calling to see how his day was going, and that hopefully it was better than yesterday, and to call me when he gets it (my message).  That was at 5:30.  It is now 8:00.  2 1/2 hours.  Think I've heard back from him?  Not a chance!  AND, just because I'm THAT predictable, you better believe I just tried calling him again, about 10 minutes ago, and I got no answer again!  This time I didn't leave a message.
I know he won't call me back.  And that REALLY pisses me off.  He can't POSSIBLY be THAT preoccupied with ANYthing, b/c he always bitches about not having anything to do.  And he shouldn't be out drinking, b/c if he was drunk, then he actually WOULD call.
Pretty pathetic, I know.  When a situation is THIS obvious, and still I pursue it, what does that say for me?  Not much, I know.  But I can't help it.  You'd have to see him.  Meet him.  He's so cute.  And he really has a certain charm about him.  In particular it's the way he smiles...especially when he does it like he KNOWS he's trying to charm you and it's working.  Or when he knows you're mad and he knows he's the reason, and he's trying to pretend like you should still be joking with him anyway.  And it sucks.
And I think sometimes how glad I am this hasn't gone any further.
And I think sometimes how disappointed I am that it hasn't gone any further.
And I think sometimes how lucky I am that things aren't different than they are.
And I think sometimes how I wish that things were different than they are.
And I think, sometimes, that I'll just move to Seattle.
No more managers to deal with.
And D.C. just has old politicians.
Seattle has the young men with money.
And I think sometimes how I need a young man with money!
And I think, sometimes, that I'll just move to Seattle.

"event","I think I forgot to mention the kind question which was raised the other day in the dry storage room (the day I was helping him clean up in there).
After him making one of his typical ""poor me, I suck"" comments, I of course, responded with the obligatory (per our agreement), ""I'm fat...I hate being so fat.  Did you see how fat I've gotten.  It sucks...I wish I wasn't so fat.""
As I finished that LAST statement (I wish I wasn't so fat...), he asked, ""Do you?  Do you wish you had bigger boobs, too?""
Ok, he KNEW the ""I'm fat"" thing was a joke.
HOWEVER, I KNOW the boob thing ISN'T.
He has a thing for big boobs.  I know what you're thinking, ""All guys do.""  
But no.
I've asked SO many guys since knowing him, and EVERY ONE of them, WITHOUT hesitation, responds with a ""yes"" when asked if it is possible for a girl's boobs to be TOO big.
He doesn't think so.
He also was kind enough to let me know about a month or two ago that his ex (Nicole) was either a D or a DD, I don't remember.
I couldn't BELIEVE he said that.
I WANTED to say, ""No, I don't.  Do YOU wish I had bigger boobs?""  But there was already one girl standing right there when he asked HIS question.  My question would have been a little too obvious.  Not that his was much better.
What a dumb thing to say.
Don't worry ladies, I DID let him know that I DON'T wish I did, as I've explained to him MANY times before, I am PERFECTLY happy with the size I am now; I've had bigger boobs before, and I didn't like them, and I'm much happier with my boobs now than I was then...the only thing I'd like to have done is maybe a lift...but I don't want them any bigger for sure.

And she didn't sound like she'd be BEAUTIFUL on the phone...I don't know whether that made me happy, b/c she may not be beautiful, or more UNhappy, out of curiousity of what she DOES look like, and also b/c there may be more of an EMOTIONAL connection there, too, if that is the case.
Either way, I walked in the office just as he was on his cell phone with her to tell her when he'd be able to meet her to pick up his daughter. (as he does every Wednesday night).  She said hello?  he said, hey what's going on?  She said what's up?  He told her when he'd be getting out of work, and she said, ok, so you wanna meet like at 5:15 then? He said that would work out perfectly, and then he asked if she was packing clothes for two days, to which she responded by asking if he was taking her through friday, and he said taht he didn't have to be in to work until Friday at 3:00, so he could meet her on his way to work to drop off his daughter, and she said, ""alright...that works!"", very chipper.  
The whole time (with the exception of the hello, she seemed pretty nice toward him.  Not at all bitchy, like he says.  It made me worry there IS a chance of them getting back together.  And hearing her voice made me wonder even more what she looks like, and how she acts, and what all they used to do together, and how they used to be together, and why, exactly, it is, that he is so hung up on her.
It sucks.
It really sucks.
I never cared about it before.
Any of it.
I just didn't worry about it.
And then before he left he changed his clothes today.
He never does that.
Just into like, running pants, a sweatshirt, and a different hat.
I had to ask him why, and when I did, he said b/c he was going to go to the gym after he picked up his daughter.
I couldn't help but wonder whether he purposely was changing into different clothes just for the sake of having Nicole ask why he did, so he could tell HER he was going to the gym, and make her realize he was getting in shape.
Sounds like over-analyzing, I know, but I really have a feeling this whole getting back into shape thing has something to do with impressing her and winning her back.
And it totally sucks.
Because even knowing (thinking?) this, I still can't help but want him.
Tonight after work I went out with a couple of people, including this guy that Josh, one of our bartenders, knew, from having been at our bar a few weeks ago.  He does business in our area every few weeks, so Josh has invited him a couple of times to hang out.  TOTALLY cute.  30.  Has that sort of Matthew McConnahey (TOTALLY spelled phoenetically b/c for the LIFE of me my drunk ass cannot even BEGIN to remember how to spell it for real fight now, though I know that somewhere in there should be a ""gh"" combination!) type of accent going on, which I usually don't find to be all that attractive on a guy, but on Matthew, I do, and surprisingly, this guy, too.
I got the feeling, had I tried, I could easily have gone back to this guy's room with him, but, for some reason, I just wasn't interested; not even drunk.  All I could think about was Tom.... 
And Nicole.
And what she looks like.
And how she acts.
And why he likes her so much.
And why he's so hung up on her.
And whether she'd get back with him.
And what she actually thinks of him.
And why he changed today.
And why he wants to get in shape.
And how they were when they were together.
And what they talked about.
EVERYTHING about HIM.
NOTHING about the guy I COULD have hooked up with.
I just don't understand this.
It sucks liking him.
It sucks more imagining NOT liking him.
It sucks WORSE thinking he might not like ME.
Or at least like that.
It would be good if he said what he meant, meant what he said, and acted like what he said was what he meant.
Instead, it just sucks.
It's 5am.  I have to go to bed.  I'm just getting to bed, and I have to drive to Northern Virginia tomorrow to get my car fixed.
THAT sucks!  
Maybe I'll end up post-poning it.
Not necessarily safe, with a fuel-line leak, and all; but, alas, I think I really need a day just to be alone with myself and my thoughts...sort a few things out.
We'll see.
I'll be back tomorrow, I'm sure!

"event","Monday morning we both worked together.  Things were fine...I started out not talking much to him...more so for the fact that I didn't want him saying that III was the reason people think something.  (Even though HE WAS the one who sought me out to play that game on Friday night...but whatever!  hehe)
Anyway, at around 2 we were pretty dead, so we cut the closers (me) and went down to just the bartender.  However, they wanted me to stick around for just a little bit, to make sure the bar didn't get slammed or anything.  So I did, and I was in the back, doing something (don't remember what-probably not important) and he was back in dry-storage, cleaning it up (again), and called out to me that since he's heard me talking for the past 20 minutes, I obviously don't have anything to do, and why don't I help him clean up dry storage?
YES!!
JUST what I wanted to do.
haha.
Actually, it wasn't SO bad, since I WAS working with him, and we were talking, and joking, and actually having quite a good time.  I especially kept making fun of him being gay (I don't even remember how it came up, THIS time), but he was just joking right back, and I was really surprised to see him carrying on *meaningless* conversation for so long, ESPECIALLY in the presence of others.
Monday night before I left I kept talking about what I was going to do, b/c it was SOOO nice out, and I mentioned that Chris had called, and I'd probably end up driving to VA to meet up with her, since it was a good driving-with-your-windows-down kind of day.  He asked, ""Oh yea?  And what are you two gonna do?""
I said, coyly, ""I don't know...probably have a couple of drinks...just see what happens..."" trying to f*ck with him.
He was like, yes!  really?  and something about were we gonna ask a boy to come, too, or something like that...
I had also mentioned somewhere in there that we may be meeting up with Kara, also, and he commented on having a boy for a threesome, to which I reminded him that, actually, there'd already be three of us girls, thereby making a foursome, if adding a guy, which, technically, would constitute an orgy.
He was happy with that, too, since, as he put it, ""I've already had the threesome...haven't had the foursome yet, though.""
Saying this right in front of the cooks.  Was that smart?  I don't think so.  But it doesn't matter to me.  
I kind of tend to think that he almost enjoys being the focus of their talk...especially since it has him getting laid by someone he sees them talk to every day.
Anyway, Chris and I ended up going out to Murphy's, and, of course, I called him.  As soon as he answered, he asked if I was already drunk, to which I responded with, ""No, YOU'RE the one who calls ME when you're drunk, sometimes I call just because.""
He also mentioned at some point that he was expecting a call from me.  I asked why and he said b/c he knew that I was going out drinking, and he knew that I'd call when I was drunk.  It was kind of funny.  And nice that he was expecting it...yet he still answered...
We talked for a few minutes, and I had Chris talk to him for a minute, and when I asked him what he was doing that night, he said nothing, he didn't have any plans, and when I asked why not, he said something stupid about how he was a loser and blah blah blah.  Well, the deal is, anytime he says something derrogatory about himself, I told him I'm going to say I'm fat (b/c I tell him he's worse than a girl insisting she's fat every day), so he'll realize how ridiculous he's being, and how often he does it.  So, I started to say, ""OHMIGOSH, and...""
He cut me off and said, ""I know, you're fat.""
So I took advantage of the opportunity to say ""Chris, did you just hear that?  He just told me I'm fat! Can you believe that!?!""  Chris, of course, instantly jumped to my side, and only a minute later, our server came by to take away a plate that had only one chicken finger left.  He asked if I was done, and I said, ""Yea, I was still hungry, but I was just told I'm fat, so I guess I shouldn't eat it."" (I was already done long before, for the record)
Tom was getting all worked up, saying I better tell her the whole story, and not make him look like an asshole, cause that's not what happened...and I said I wasn't making him look like an asshole, he's the one who said it.
Anyway, a few minutes later, I don't remember what Chris said, but it was something she said about him, or toward him, and I was like, sorry, she's just a little bitter toward the male species right now.  *He knows the basic background of her situation, and why we were out that night* so he said, yea, I know, men can be assholes, and I said some aren't, or something like that, and he said, ""Well, I'm willing to change that; I can't speak for all the other men, but I'm willing to change.""
I asked him how (unsure what THAT meant) and he said he couldn't say, b/c it was top-secret or some sh*t, and I asked again, and he said he was implementing his plan as we spoke.  I asked how, and he said he didn't know.  Then he said from now on he's just going to be honest...brutally honest, and something else, and I was like, Wow, you're right, that IS a change for you, to which he argued that he's always been honest with me, and I argued that he hasn't, but that, given that we talked round and round about this the other night, was it really necessary for us to bring it up again and get nowhere.  Normally, that's where he'd say no.  Instead, he said, ""What are you talking about?""
I again mentioned the ""Let's see where this goes...Let's just get to know each other...blah blah blah...""
He AGAIN denied it, saying all he's ever said is that I work for him.  Yea, that was HALF of the conversation...so CLEARLY you remember the conversations I'm speaking of.
Anyway, I think I was the one that kind of started to end that conversation, and we hung up shortly after.
I called him about an hour later from Chris's apartment (neither of us felt much like drinking) and we talked for a few minutes.  I don't think there was anything real big in that.
Just so happened that last Thursday's episode of Friends (which I'd missed from being out with Chris...and he'd taped, b/c he, too, is a big fan...I love that about him), was the one where Ross and Rachel almost hook up, but Ross turns her down.
I watched it at Chris's that night, and I called him on my way home and left a voicemail that he was actually the SECOND person I know willing to turn down sex...the other being a FICTITIOUS character...Ross Gellar.
Hmmm...kinda makes you wonder...
Anyway...
Tuesday lunch we worked together and things were going fine, but I was in a bad mood, made worse every time I thought about him and our situation, and what is (or isn't) going on, and what he thinks, and what exactly it is that he's doing here...and yada yada yada.
So, at one point, I commented about being really stressed, and Tom, King of Saying the Wrong Thing these days, asked,
""What are YOU stressed about?  You have no stress.  You don't have any responsibilities.""
Meanwhile, I'm just looking at him, obviously pissed, and asked, ""Really?"" and he was like, ""Oh yea, that's right.  I forgot. You've got it so bad."" (Which I never said...but I am a litte stressed)
That made me more angry b/c it just PROVES he knows nothing about me, or he'd know that wasn't true.
Anyway, I got up and walked away, and a few minutes later he was standing in the back near me doing something, and he commented that I was ""a little sensitive about the responsibility thing, huh?""  I just walked away as he explained he was ""Just trying to ruffle your feathers...apparently it worked.""
Never got an apology.
But he was standing by table 10 a little later, while Jason was talking to me about working this morning (which I have to get ready for, like, 30 minutes ago), and Jason mentioned to me that the schedule has been written for the next two weeks, so I found that to be a PERFECT opportunity to mention my b-day and see if he remembers it.
So I said I didn't request off for my b-day, which falls under those two weeks, and Tom asked if I just found out when my b-day was, joking, obviously, and I said I didn't expect to have to request off 3 weeks early, and he again asked, but with this really cute half smile, and looking right at me, almost in a...I'm trying to make you not be mad, and aren't I still cute...kind of way.
I couldn't help looking at him and smiling.
Anyway, we both left work at the same time yesterday, and I called him a couple of minutes later to see if he'd go have a drink.  I knew he wouldn't, but I did it more to prove that point to myself, to remind myself why I DON'T want to waste my time on him, as I've been having some trouble remembering that lately.
SO, of course, he said he was trying to get home in time to watch the Maryland game at 8 (it was already 5:30...and an hour, hour and a half ride home) and he wanted to go to the gym, too.  Not wanting to discourage the gym, I didn't try to convince him, but said we could go watch the game somewhere.  He said ""MAYBE.  I'll call you later, butI'm not making any promises."" 
I clarified, ""MAYBE we'll go out, but you'll DEFINITELY call either way, right?""
He repeated, ""I'll call either way.""
Guess if he called.
Right.
Actually, it was just as well, b/c I was again already getting mad at him for something he didn't do as I was driving home KNOWING he wouldn't call.  So that made me not want to do anything with him.  And my bad mood was getting worse, so I really didn't want to do anything with anyone.  So I came home, changed into pajamas, and caught up on this live journal thing.  Then I went to bed.  So I wouldn't have gone anyway, quite honestly.  But that's not the point.  
The POINT is, if you SAY you're going to call someone, then DAMMIT CALL.  Even if it's for a minute to say, ""I'm not going out tonight, but I really can't talk right now b/c the game is starting""  I wouldn't have been upset about THAT, b/c I KNOW he wanted to watch the game. (Still would have been upset that again he had a reason not to hang out...but whatever, CALLLLLL)
AND on the way home last night, the first 10 or 15 minutes of the drive we go the same way, and when I first had called, he said he was trying to check his voicemail messages.   But after we hung up, he was on his phone for several minutes...and before leaving work he commented that he didn't have any missed calls (let's see if anyone loves me...nope...no one loves me...just joking around), then said, oh, wait, one person...DAMMIT...quit calling...some bill collector or something he'd said...telemarketer, I don't remember.
He said they called once.
I was looking with him at it, just barely over his shoulder, and I could have SWORN it said TWO missed calls.
AND I find it odd that if the company he didn't want to talk to was the ONLY one that left a message, he wouldn't have taken THAT long to check his messages, and DAMN sure wouldn't have called them back.  And he said he hates talking on the phone.
I'm PRETTY sure there was a call from someone else.  And pretty sure he called them back.
Not saying THAT was why we didn't hang out...I don't think that.  But OBVIOUSLY SOME people he'll talk to.
I dunno.
Overthinking, I know.

I REALLY have to go get ready for work now.  I've been late the past two days.  Yesterday we were ALL late...no opener, and all 11:00's were late, and right at 11 we had 3 tables walk in the door.  They DEFINITELY noticed, and they DEFINITELY were not happy.  oh well.

Time to go let him see I'm mad.  I'm SO not talking to him AT ALL today.
I hate him.

"event","*AND AGAIN not written in real time...in fact, at 6:30am on Monday, I think I was already asleep*

So, we had GREAT sex that morning when we woke up...at freaking 4:15am.  Then he got up to take his shower.
And I did it.
I knew I shouldn't have.
I still know I shouldn't have.
I still can't believe I did.
But I couldn't help it.
I've never been curious.
Never been jealous.
Never worried about ANYTHING that was a relationship, a girlfriend, a situation, or a part of his past (or current).
Just didn't bother me.
Until our phone conversation last Thursday night, at which point I began to realize he was still so into Nicole that he is actually TRYING...ACTIVELY CONSCIOUSLY TRYING to win her back.  
Suddenly after that my mind became a whirlwind of thoughts and images and questions and worries that it only ever was with Craig, and never yet had been with Tom.
Great.
I still don't know EXACTLY why I did it...though I have a PRETTY good idea why.
I looked in his phone at his call history log.
Yes, I did.
I'm not proud.  
And I KNOW I shouldn't have.
But he was in the shower.
His phone was right by me.  
I couldn't help it.
Turns out he HADN'T called Nicole while drunk that night (a plus)  HOWEVER he HAD called her at 9:47 in the morning on Sunday.  Disturbing why?  Because earlier the night before he'd told me he'd been up since 9:30.  Which makes a phone call to her one of the first things he thought to do.  And something tells me it WASN'T because of his daughter.
Another disturbing find?  My number is in there just as my number.  Her's as Nicole.  His Mom's as Mom (cute, too, that he'd called her a couple of times).  His Dad's as Dad.  His friend Missy (whom he's supposed to be moving in with) as Missy.
Mine-just as my number.  
GRANTED, I REALIZE we work together, and there's that whole cautiousness issue...but REALLY...I DOUBT anyone will EVER get his phone and see that I called...unless he gives it to them.  AND...he does have a few other friends who's numbers are only in there as numbers, and not names, which, leads me to think, maybe casual people he doesn't put names for...so even when we DON'T work together there won't be a name.
OVER-THINKING, I KNOW.
BUT REALLY...
You don't just NOT put someone's name in your phone who's number you've been dialing after THREE F*ing MONTHS!
ANYWAY...
THE LAST thing I found that disturbed me...
There was an outgoing call to one of these ""numbers only"" listings at 11:17 pm on Sunday.  That would be somewhere RIGHT in between his phone calls to me.
Was it one of the ones he hung up with me and said I'll call you right back"" for?  Or one of the times he'd lost service.
I mean, really, what WAS SO important...who would he call at 11:17 on a Sunday night?  IN BETWEEN calls to me?  WHILE drunk.  Who DOESN'T even get a name in his cell phone?  (AT LEAST I know it's not Nicole, since hers has a name, or Missy, my other feared threat, since hers, too, has a name).
 
It really bothered me.  I can't explain how, and I can't say exactly why.  But it just did.  It gave me a really weird feeling.  All of it.
I think it was like before I just saw Nicole as a part of his past...I never even thought twice about the fact that he sees her twice a week to pick up and drop off his daughter...but now in light of all of his talking lately, I see her as a part of his life still...and even the thought that on Wednesday he'll see her to pick up his daughter makes me wonder what he'll say, and what he'll be thinking of her...and how she actually feels about him, and how much of a chance there really is of them ever getting back togethr.
It's just a really strange feeling that I can't quite put into words.
And I hate it.
And honestly, I'm kind of glad I looked in his phone.
A little.

Anyway, he got out of the shower, and came back and laid down in bed with me, and turned the light back off (which I'd turned on) and actually laid down WITH me, not just with me.  He rested his head against mine, and it was just very peaceful, and cute, and comfortable.  For about a minute.  Until I started wondering whether he always did that with Nicole.  And whether it meant anything or he was just doing it to try to keep me as close as he needs me for whenever he needs me.  And it didn't stop there.  The entire time he was getting ready, all I thought was I wonder whether Nicole slept while he would get ready, or if they'd actually sit there and talk.  I wondered whether they always had wake up sex, as we do, or whether she didn't feel like it.  What they talked about.  What he did the same.  What he did differently.  It absolutely drove me NUTS.
This isn't as fun now.
It's starting to feel more like it did with Craig.
Miserable.
I left that morning and barely said bye when he did.
I was actually irritated with him for something he didn't even do...or say...just from everything I was thinking, and for realizing it meant I'd always feel shitty around him.
He didn't even seem to notice.
That made me more mad."

"event","*Again, this note is being written after the fact.  I'm PRETENDING that I am writing it at the time it happened*

Sunday we both were off.  I was scheduled to work 4-cl, but I gave up my shift to Lawrence.  That evening I went to my gym to work out.  (although, HALF of the equipment I couldn't even use, b/c for SOME reason I couldn't get the weights to adjust, so I was only able to use the equipment for which the weights were already set to an amount I could use...DEFINITELY annoying)
I went b/c, partially, I wanted to go work on getting back in shape and losing weight, but also b/c it was about 10:30, and I'd just gotten off of the phone RAMBLING to Chris about all of my frustrations, and I KNEW that ""he"" would already be asleep b/c Mondays he has to get up WAY early, so I didn't want to be tempted to call and A. look weak ONCE again, and B. not get anywhere b/c I'd either get his voicemail, or an obviously woken up answer, neither of which would prove to be a situation conducive to striking up ANY kind of conversation, much less INTERESTING conversation, and I'd only be mad at myself for making myself look weak while STILL getting nowhere with him.
I figured if I went to the gym for about an hour, by the time I got home I'd know FOR A FACT he was asleep, and there was no WAY I'd call.
Anyway, I got home at 11:00.  As soon as I did, I started to take the kitchen garbage out, and just as SOON as I did THAT, my phone rang.  I was PRAYING, and when I say PRAYING, I mean BEGGING God to PLEASE let it be him, even though, really, deep down, I knew there was no way it was, and it was probably either Chris calling me back for something, or my brother calling to say he was on his way home or something.
I looked at the phone, and IT WAS HIM!!!!
I was SOOOOO excited! 
Of course, I asked him what he was doing, and he said he was driving home from Pennsylvania.  Translation, he was DRUNK, and THAT was the ONLY reason he was calling.  HOWEVER, he still thought to call ME when he was drunk, even though I hadn't called HIM!  That's a plus, though probably the most twisted, far-stretch of a plus I've ever credited anyone with!
He actually said when I picked up the phone that he thought I was still at work, and he was just gonna call and leave a message, then jokingly asked if I could please hang up and let it ring so he could leave a message.  
*Side note, after I hung up with him, I noticed I had a missed call from him at 10:42.  That time he didn't leave a message.  I don't get why he's been doing that lately.  BUT, he DID call back 20 minutes later!*
So we talked for a while, and out of NOWHERE he asked me how many people I hooked up with last week, and I said none, and he definitely didn't believe me, and he kept asking, saying he knows I hooked up with SOMEONE, and why don't I just tell him, and why can't I just be honest, and why do I have to lie about it, it's no big deal, why won't I just stop lying about it?  (He EVEN brought up the fact that I had lied to him about Lawrence...THREE MONTHS AGO, PEOPLE...and only for THREE days...and ONLY to prove to him that I wouldn't go and run my mouth to the first person who asked about who I'd hooked up with, since, after all, I WAS trying to convince HIM he could trust me not to do that to him...AND, I VOLUNTARILY told him the truth ON my own, without any prompting...but apparently, I'm thinking that must still be bothering him; b/c everyone knows you tell truths you meant to keep quiet when you're drunk.  Well, GOOD.  That makes me happy to think it bothers him, and he thinks about it)
Anyway, I finally took advantage of the opportunity to mention that, no, I hadn't hooked up with anyone, and, in fact, ""the ONE person I'd prefer to hook up with apparently isn't having any of it, so ... no, I definitely didn't hook up with anyone.""
He asked, ""Oh really...the one person you'd prefer to hook up with...who's that?""  (knowing OF COURSE who I was talking about.)
So I said...(Ok, forget protecting his identity here, you ALL know who he is now)
""It's this guy Tom I know.  He's a friend of this guy Ray that works with my friend Nikki."" (A reference to the fact that first it was ""Nikki and Ray"" and now it's ""April and Tom"", as, strangely enough, we both have different work names than our REAL names.
I continued to explain that he used to be so awesome, up until recently, or something like that, and he said that yea, guys all do that...and I said something about that they don't have to...and he said guys are just assholes, or whatever...ANYWAY...
Somehow the subject got onto the fact that EVERYone at work thinks that we're sleeping together, and that it's because IIII mess around with him too much, and blah blah blah, and I was like, REALLY!?!?  You don't do ANYthing, either, do you?  He of course, acted like he didn't.
We hung up a few times, but each time he said he'd call me back, and, surprisingly, each time he did.  (usually b/c he was going out of service or something)  
Anyway, finally around 11:30 or so we were talking for only a couple of minutes, when, out of NOWHERE...HE finally DID IT!
He asked, ""So, anyway... Well do you wanna come out here tonight or what?""
I said, ""Do you want me to?""
He said, ""Well, yea, I mean, if you want""
HOLY SH*T!!!  SLIGHT PROGRESS...AGAIN...I REALIZE he was drunk...but even DRUNK I'M always the one who has to initiate it.  YEY!
So, of course, I took a shower, shaved, got ready, and went up to his place...KNOWING I'd only be there from like, 12:30 or 1:00 until about 4 or 5 cause he had to work.   But I couldn't say NO, and risk him not asking again, b/c he figured I'd say no, or some dumb sh*t like that!

I got there and he was actually awake, even though he told me that he might be asleep when I got there (and I expected him to be) but he'd leave the back door open.  He was in his room in bed writing out bills when I got there.  It was actually a little different this time.  We sat there for about 10 mintues while he finished what he was doing, and then even before we went to sleep we both were just laying in bed kind of talking, with the light still on, like he wasn't just trying to go straight to sleep or something.  Sounds normal, I KNOW...but really...NOT normal with him.  
Anyway, after we'd turned the lights out, we were just laying in bed for a little while, and then we ended up kind of messing around, but only for a few minutes, and going to sleep.  A while later, he woke up, and the same thing.  We actually didn't have sex until like 4am when the alarm went off.  So it was kind of nice that even though I'm sure that IS why he called, at the same time, it's almost like that wasn't the ONLY reason he called...since, by the time we actually had sex, I KNOW he wasn't drunk anymore.

I'm going to cut this one here, and start again with that morning on the next one, again, to give those of you with other things to do a break, and a chance to decide whether you have the time or energy to continue reading right now!"

"event","Saturday went really well at work.
I got in and I didn't speak to him for about an hour or so.  He was on one side of the line, and I was on the other.  Finally, after about an hour, I went in the back to get something, and he happened to be standing right where I was, and said, ""Good Morning,"" (it was 4 o'clock).
I just looked at him kind of with an ""Ok, I'm not really sure why you're speaking to me"" look, and he kinda laughed, and said, ""Oh, what, you're not talking to me now?""
I said, ""No, I didn't think we were.  I figured I'd be like you.  It works well for you.""
He just kinda half laughed, and said, ""Whatever,"" as he walked away, kind of like he thought it was funny and knew EXACTLY why I wasn't happy with him, and kind of like he just didn't feel like getting into it. 
Well, after about another hour or so, we just gradually started talking and joking and stuff, and we were having a good time, just like usual. 
I was the food runner that night, and I had thrown a french fry at one of the guys.  When I did, he commented that ""he"", ""Better come get your girl"".  When he didn't see him standing on the line, he started yelling around, asking where he was, and repeating himself a few times, that he ""better come calm his WIFE down, b/c she was throwing stuff"".
Anyway, one of the other cooks just happened to be on the server side at the time, and when he heard the ""wife"" reference he ran back into the kitchen, asking, ""Wait a second.  WIFE?  What's this?  What did I miss...his WIFE?!?"", knowing that he was talking about me...but they all feed off of each other when that topic comes up.  I was laughing, and telling them to shut up, b/c it really is funny how frenzied they all get about it, b/c they will ALLLLL start talking sh*t about it, and honestly, if it weren't true that there IS something going on, then the whole thing would be even funnier.  Or maybe that's why it IS funny...is b/c it's true.  I don't know.
So, finally he happened to come back on the line, and they started telling him directly to ""calm his wife down"", and he just stood there, kind of half smiling, in the cute way he does, and looking right at me, almost as if to say, ""What can you do?""  He didn't try to deny it, like Craig used to, or act like an ass about it.  Just stood there looking cute.
Later someone must've said something, though at the time, I wasn't around, b/c when I came back, he was just coming back onto the line, as well, and one of the guys was calling the other guy out, asking, ""Oh, whatever.  Bullsh*t.  You didn't just say, 'don't say that to him, man, that's his girl'?""
The other guy kept saying he didn't, and ""he"" (as if it wouldn't be obvious to ANYone who read this by this point who ""he"" was!?!  haha  oh well.  it's to protect his identity from strangers!) just stood there, again, listening and laughing.  So finally the guy admitted, ""Look man, he writes my schedule.  I'm not gonna say that to his face.""
ANYhow,
At the end of the night he came up to me and asked me if I wanted to learn how to play Liar's Poker with dollar bills.  (Personally, after learning, I came to the conclusion that it's more like the card game Bullsh*t than it is like Poker, but, whatever, that's the name of the game, and I can't change it).  So, of course I said yes, b/c it was another reason to stand around with him, talking and having fun.
The look on his face when he'd try to convince me he wasn't lying...especially the look as he'd start to smile...but try to stop himself...it was the cutest thing ever!  (unfortunately, the only person I know to have seen him is my brother, and that was on friday night when he came in...however, I don't expect my brother to get excited over another guy's looks)
Then after, maybe like an hour later, I was still there, and he asked if I wanted to play again, so I said sure, and we both changed out our bills for ones, and sat down at table 10 and played for about 10 minute.  It's a great game for eye contact, as it turns out, b/c you have an excuse to look at the other person to see if you can determine whether they are lying...and also to convince the other that you are not.
So we had a REALLY good time.
It was great.
That night was an independently organized impromptu certified trainers' meeting.  What I mean by this is that it was not organized, or even run by, managers, they had no involvment what-so-ever in it, and it was only decided upon about 3 days ahead of time.  We decided we'd have it at midnite, since we're all night-time people, not ""9 am meeting"" people!  Up until that night, I'd planned to go, but by the time I was ready to leave work, I just couldn't make myself stick around longer to talk about work!  ugh.
So I left.  I Pretended that I'd forgotten about it.
Until 4 people called to remind me.  (Melanie, who's not even a trainer, but heard them asking where I was and if I was going, Erika, who called, but didn't leave a message, Jen M., who called, and DID leave a message, and the fourth person.)
As I called Jen M. back to leave her a message that I'd forgotten, and honestly wasn't feeling well anyway, there was a beep (I assumed Jen calling me after seeing she missed my call, though, due to the lack of a good solid cell phone these days, that can handle being dropped in water, the display screen on mine no longer lights up on a consistent basis, and, naturally, that night was no exception), so I couldn't see who it was.  However, I wanted to finish leaving her the message, not have to talk to her, then check her message to see what she said, and THEN decide whether to try to call her back again.
Well, lo and behold, it was ""HIM"", not Jen!!!!
At about 12:30 am, he called me on his way home.
When I asked why, he said he was calling to find out where I was and why I didn't go to that trainer's meeting (I didn't find out until the next day that Jen was asking HIM where I was, as if HE would know)
ANYway, I commented to him that he got out early (compared to the night before at 1:30, and he said yea, that he'd actually been gone for about 20 minutes.
This is interesting for a couple of reasons.
1.  Why do you care if I was there or not? He NEVER worries about server issues, AND, it wasn't a mgmt issue...we were just meeting at Longhorn, and then heading back to Jen's for the meeting.
2.  IF you really were calling JUST to see why I didn't go, then why wouldn't you have called at 12:10, when you FIRST left, at which point I'd only be 10 minutes late, may still be able to get there, and it would just make more sense, since you were JUST leaving, and therefore curious why I wasn't there.  NOT when you get 20 minutes down the road and think, hmmm...why wasn't she there...I'll call and find out.

SO...what IIIII like to think is that b/c I hadn't called him (as I usually would have),and I'd left without saying bye (which I usually wouldn't have), and we DID have a fun night...MAYBE he actually just WANTED to call...but OF COURSE...he'd NEVER call without a REASON...or unless he was calling me BACK (and even then, sometimes not), so...I'd LIKE to think, that after about 20 minutes of telling himself he wouldn't call (as I would do), he finally decided he could call just to find out why I wasn't there.
Probably a stretch.
That's something IIII would do, not him.
But it makes me feel better to think it.

Well, we talked for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then we hung up, but when we did, I saw I had a voicemail message, which was from him, from when I didn't answer.  I listened to it, and it was SO cute; it was very playful sounding, which is a big change from his normal drab ""hey, just calling to see what's going on...I guess I'll talk to you later"" generic message.  It was something like, ""Hey, what are YOU doing?  Must be something bad, cause you're not answering your phone!""...blah blah blah...something about why I wasn't there, and he'd talk to me later.

It actually showed some kind of PERSONALITY...an INTEREST in leaving a message.  It was really cute.  It made me smile!
Lately, he never makes me smile.  At least not without making me mad before or after.  Not like he used to.

ugh.

I know he's an ass.
I know he pisses me off.
But I don't think he does it on purpose.
Maybe he does.
Sometimes I think he does.
He's really a waste of my time; I'm sure of it.
But I just might like him anyway."

""Take It Like a Man""

Boy meets girl it's a delicate thing
So much time spent wondering
If what you see...is what you get

I keep looking for a friend and a lover
I find one and he ain't the other
Sometimes, I just wanna quit

One wants a maid, one needs his mother
They either want space       
Or they wanna smother me
And my poor heart needs somebody who

Chorus:
Can take it like a man
Steady and strong
Not a lot of fuss and carrying on
True to a promise I can ride in a storm
Take it like a man
Who knows about love
Every little thing that a girl dreams of
Someone wise enough to understand
If you want this womans heart...
Take it like a man

I met somebody the other night
Started thinking he was Mr. Right...wrong
I might've never known
If a friend hadn't brought it to my attention
He's got a wife he forgot to mention, girl
Leave that fool alone
I keep hoping, and telling myself
That somewhere there's one good one left
Cause my poor heart needs somebody who

Chorus

Take it like a man
Well honey if you want my heart
You gotta take it like a man
Take it like a man"

"event","Friday and Saturday night, he and I both closed together.  Both nights went great, although, Friday night did begin with him seeming to be a little stand-offish, and, possibly, slightly irritated.  (He was in the office and heard this guy Josh, that I work with, and I, joking about putting a room divider in the office so ""he"" could stay in there and work, and we could use the other side to make-out.  When Josh went to ask him if he was ok with it, b/4 he could even say what he was going to, he cut him off and said, ""Yea, I know, you guys wanna make out in here.  whatever,"" and didn't really seem too up to going along with the joke.  At least I know he WAS listening to our conversation as we stood outside the door!) 
ANYway, after about an hour or so, he started being normal again, and we talked and joked and laughed like we'd been all week.
At the end of the night, I was complaining about having to roll silverware (I wasn't closing, I was number 3.  Number 3 NEVER has to roll, b/c it's usually all rolled by then, but freaking Erika, *who I love to death* ALWAYS takes 3 hours to do her sh*t at night, and she still hadn't rolled, so that meant we both had to do what was left).  Anyway, so he kept saying he'd do it if I paid him $20, and I kept saying ok, but then he kept backing out of it, like he would....BUT.
So FINALLY I went and threw a twenty and five ones at him and I said, ""THAT'S how sick I am of this silverware bullsh*t!""
He started laughing, but took the money and agreed to roll.  The closers had already been checked out, given that all that was left was Erika and I rolling silverware, so it was just me, him, Erika, and Mike, a manager.  I told Erika she could go, b/c I'd paid him, and I stuck around just to help polish the knives for him.  (and b/c the night was going so great, and we'd been having so much fun, I didn't want the night to be over).  FINALLY probably about 45 minutes later, Mike was already done with all of his stuff, so he left.  Then it was just me, ""him"", and the cleaning guy.
Great.
I'm sure THAT looked good.
Mike already thinks there's something going on between he and I.  I'm sure that didn't help to change his mind any!  oh well, he was the one who decided to leave...not like we asked him to or anything!
So before we left, after we finished rolling everything and cleaning it up, he was complaining that it was almost 1:30, which meant that he wouldn't get home until almost 2:30, and I unsympathetically reminded him that I'd only be home a half hour before him.
SO, when I got home, I thought it would be funny to call and tell him I'd forgotten my housekey at work.  (this would mean he'd either have to let me stay at his place, OR go all the way back to work to let me in, b/c he knew no one else was there).  So I called, and went through this whole explanation (when asked how I have my CAR, and not my KEY), that I don't keep my house key and car key on the same chain b/c it's not smart...and also when asked, that my brother wouldn't be coming home, b/c he'd be staying over at his friend's house, whom he'd come into work earlier in the evening with, as he usually stays there at night.  (which, he doesn't, but ""he"" didn't know that)
SOOO...when he FINALLY said, ""So what are you telling me?"", and DEFINITELY sounded a little irritated, b/c he was tired, and I think he KNEW what I was telling him, I said, starting to laugh, ""I'm telling you...that I'm f*cking with you.  I didn't forget my key, I'm actually at home right now.""
He hung up on me.
Yep.
So I called back.
Dumbass answered the phone.  
I don't know about anyone else, but if IIII hang up on someone, there's a reason, and that means that when (if) they call back, I'm NOT going to answer it!  
But he does.
So I asked if he hung up, he said, he did, I asked why, he said b/c, something about b/c he's tired and something something something, blah blah blah, so I said something back, and he said (I know, sounds like the world's most in-depth conversation, right), ""You played a joke on me, saying you forgot your key, so that was my joke, I hung up on you"", but he was kinda kidding then.  Well, I think it was right before that, (or maybe it was the ""something something something"" that I couldn't remember, but he actually got pretty snappy, and was like, ""ok, what, what do you want?  What do you need?"" You know in that real hurried, annoyed voice.
Ew.
So I asked why he had an attitude, and I think he said again something about being tired, and I started laughing, and I was like, ""Alright, well, anyway, I was just joking when I said I forgot my key; the real reason I was calling was so I could rub it in b/c I'm home, and you're still driving!""
Um, yea.  He hung up on me again.
Dick-head~
This time he DIDN'T answer when I called back!
So I left a voicemail, still not sounding too annoyed, or anything, but just kind of a general, ok, why are you mad, I was just kidding, type of message.
About 15 minutes later, he STILL hadn't called back.
So I called back AGAIN (which of course he didn't answer), and this time left a very CLEARLY irritated message.  Something along the lines of, ""Okay, I was just f*cking with you before, but obviously, you've got an attitude, and you're all mad about it, so that's fine.  If you want to be mature, and not have an attitude, then call me back; if not, then whatever.""
He DEFINITELY didn't call then.
I guess now we know <if there ever was ANY uncertainty before>, that girls are so much more mature than guys.  I mean, seriously, do you REALLY know ANYone who'd get THAT upset over a 3 1/2 minute JOKE that didn't AFFECT them, didn't take ANY time out of there day, and really WASN'T a big deal!?! 

So that was friday night.  Although it is Tuesday, now, I am going to attempt change the date and time info to AFTER my previous journal already written on Saturday, which was done to make up for the entry I missed on THURSDAY, then never got around to writing this one!  And I will break down the four days worth of entries I've missed, so as not to overwhelm those of you who actually have REAL jobs, and don't have the time to invest which is necessary to fully catch up on the drama that is my life.  *At least I can say it's entertaining drama...for myself, at least!  It keeps me occupied*

So Saturday's entry is coming."

"event","Alright, here it is...the run-down on where things stand.

Thursday night, Chris and I went out and had a few drinks.  3 sips into my first drink, my pathetic sober DUMB ass, decided I WANTED to get drunk, just for the sake of being able to drunk-dial ""the male"" and say a few things/ask a few questions that have been driving me nuts.  I now have 2 friends who in LESS than the time he and I have known each other, have MET, talked to, and established a relationship with, a significant other.  And by less time, what I mean is really- less than a month, and less than a weekend (hi Chris).  And ALREADY THEIR guys are willing to establish themselves as being together.  Even my BROTHER, who, God love him, is a wonderful guy, but still...my BROTHER, has been able to establish something with HIS ""she-friend"".  Granted, that one DID take a while...but then, at least they've always talked...A LOT...and gotten along great...and it's never been an issue of one being an ass, or being hung-up on someone else.  ANNNNYway...

I definitely did get a little tipsy, and at around 8:15, I called.  I got his voicemail, but opted not to leave a message, knowing I'd end up calling again shortly, and at least it wouldn't look so bad if I hadn't left a message the first time.  Luckily, I didn't have to, because about 15 minutes later, he called me back.  As it turns out, he was still at dinner with Paula and all of the other MITs who are going to be going to his store.  I knew they had the meeting that day, but I didn't think they'd still be there.  Anyway, they were, so he obviously couldn't answer the phone then.  
So we talked for a few minutes, and he said he'd call me when he left, (he was no longer at dinner, he'd gone up to Outback and was up at the bar there), which he said would be soon.

Naturally, it wasn't soon...or maybe just not soon enough in my drunk mind.  Well, I think I called him back again, or something, I don't remember all of the specifics of the call-backs at this point, b/c there ended up being several.  In any case, I'd already planned with Chris to have her <loudly> in the background ask who was on the phone, and say she wanted to talk to them, just so she could talk to him and see how he reacted.  So she did, and they talked, and he was cool, and she asked his name, and though the first time he jokingly said ""Bob"", he actually did end up telling her it was Tom.  She asked him what he does, and he said he was in hospitality.  ha.  So we talked for a few minutes, and I was joking with him about the fact that Chris and I were up for a 3-some, blah blah blah...whatever.  
At some point during one of our many brief conversations at the bar, he thought it was a good idea to mention to me that there was some girl, I THINK that he used to work with, or something, who I believe had gotten a boob job, or something like that...don't remember EXACTLY his point in his final statement, perhaps b/c I was a little too focused on his comment that, apparently he's been trying to get her to show him her boobs, and she won't, well, actually, she did show him her nipple (a while ago), but that's it, so he was trying to get her to show him.
WHY is it a good idea to tell another girl that?
Strike ONE.
So we talk more off and on through-out the night, and at one point, he has the audacity to ask me what Chris looks like.  Granted, in the context of the conversation, I'd say it was a joke, but then, in light of the new asshole he's becoming, I wouldn't doubt he really wanted to know.
Can't call it a strike, for the sake of giving the benefit-of-the-doubt.
The call there?
Foul!
So, as Chris and I head home, I'm on the phone with him, and we're joking about the 3-some again.  I told him we were seriously on our way.  I made another one of my jokes at some point about him being gay, and he once again said he wasn't and asked why I always say that, and I said, ""Because, you're the ONLY guy I know who turns down sex"".  He said, ""I don't turn down sex"".  (Mind you, he does sometimes, and, in particular, that night he was again making excuses as to why we couldn't get together, and saying he didn't believe we were really coming, anyway.  Which, of course, WE weren't, but IIII would have).  So I asked, ""really, then what are you doing right now?""  And he asked, ""Are you offering me sex tonight?""  I don't remember what I said, or how the conversation went after that...but in some way, I'm sure I basically said yes...and after more talking and joking around, something about us going there...he had asked ""are two of you coming or just one?""  
OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
STRIKE TWO.
DOES IT F***ING MATTER?
So I asked, ""Would it make a difference if there was just one of use coming?!?""  He said, ""well, I'm all excited about the 3-some.  I'm not as excited about the 2-some.  I've had that before"" or something like that.  REALLY.  He's ALSO had THREEsomes before, so THAT'S not a legitimate reason.
I mentioned something then about him being lucky I was drunk at the time, b/c otherwise that comment would have really pissed me off.
Anyway, when we kind of jokingly, but still semi-seriously started talking about me going that night, he of course began making excuses.  His dad was home. (he's only there temporarily...he was waiting until he found out what store he was going to, so he could get a place close to where he'd be working).  Anyway, not like I've never been there when he was, too.  I guess ""the male"" just wasn't drunk enough that night.
So, of course, SOMEhow, in SOMEway, though, for the life of me, I cannot BEGIN to imagine HOW, b/c it's never a very subtle segue that flows with the conversation, he managed to bring his ex's name into the conversation.  I was pretty irritated on many levels with him already at this point, and ESPECIALLY for always talking about her, and mixed with the alcohol, had no tolerance.  So, in a none-too-kind tone of voice, I said, ""OKAY...and THAT's enough about HER.""  His response?  ""Well, you know how I feel about her.""
Right.
So don't worry about how IIIII feel about her.  Not to mention...that's what you have guy friends for.  Not somebody you're ... I dunno, doing whatever we're doing with.
So, you guessed it...
Strike THREE.
Anyway, I responded to that with, ""I know...and I've gotten to know her very well in the past 3 months.""
Well, somehow, this all ended up leading to serious conversation...mostly about him and her.
Before that, I don't remember what he said, but some OTHER DUMB comment...probably one that was insulting, ignorant, or otherwise lacking consideration...and I made a comment about seriously, why don't I just get you a bull-dozer...you can dig your hole even faster.  Right about now, I'm thinking that's not true.  I think he digs his own holes MUCH quicker.
One of his best comments for the evening was when he was explaining how he felt about the situation.  This, AFTER I mention to him that clearly with his hang-up over his ex, he's not ready to move on to anyone else, so why even lie to anybody and say he wants to get to know them, and see where things go, when he's obviously not ready, and clearly doesn't want to yet.  And after talking along those lines for a few minutes, he mentioned that, again, b/c of our work situation, with me working for him and all...blah blah blah, and that he tries...then even clarified, he's always tried...to avoid me unless he was drunk!!!!!
Okay, and THAT'S the game folks!  He's just been ejected!
Are you KIDDING me.  WHY is THAT a good idea to say!?!
He tried to amend his statement when I told him that's what I've said all along, but his amendment was really not much different than the original statement.  So, when he asked, ""do you get what I'm saying?""  I of course, said, ""Yea, you're saying that you only want to see me when you're drunk, which is what I've always told you and you denied.""
He tried to say that wasn't what he meant, just that when he's drunk he's less cautious, and more willing to take the risk, (personally, I still think my answer is a LITTLE more accurate, that when he's drunk he plans on getting LAID...and THEREFORE is more willing to take that risk)
Anyway, again, it wasn't like he said it with the intention of being an ass...and I don't think he MEANT it like that, necessarily, but even still, there are some things you don't say.  AND, if that IS the way it is...I've been right all along, so why would you have denied it.
Anyway, not much longer after, he explained that ""if it was  a different situation, and if you weren't working for me, then I'd probably be attracted to you, and......well, I mean, I AM attracted to you, it's not even a question of that, but ya know, then I'd probably see..."" and I don't remember what came next, b/c he kinda trailed off and I don't think he was really willing to completely finish that sentence.
So, points for saying you're definitely attracted to me, but really, could you THINK before you begin a sentence!?!
Anyway, I eventually ended up asking him realistically what kind of a chance he really thought there was of he and his ex ever getting back together.  This was mostly for my own knowledge. although I presented as an attempt to explain to him that with his foreseeing such a slim chance, why waste his time?  Anyway, his answer was that ""realistically, I'd say probably only about a 15-20% chance...""
Now...I'll let you hang on to that sentence for a while, so you can experience the rest of the sentence in slow motion, as I did.  I heard that, and even though he immediately continued with the rest of the sentence, I heard it SO slowly, as it was nearly impossible to digest completely.  And, quite honestly, I think this is about where those truly nauseating feelings of jealousy...partially for the known, and partially for the unknown...kicked in. 
The sentence continued, without missing a beat, ""...and I'd ONLY say even 15-20% in light of the things I've done recently to try to woo her"".
Yep.  And then time stopped.
Was it NOT enough just to answer the question!?!  Did you HAVE to explain why?  I didn't ASK why.  There was NO reason WHATSOEVER to even mention what you've done recently.  So, I asked (sounding much calmer and more okay with it than I even thought I could pretend to be), ""Really, what have you done?""
He apparently got her a card b/c she passed some test or some class or something she had...he signed from him AND his daughter, but still...NOT the point.  AND...he GOT HER SOMETHING FOR VALENTINE'S DAY...and, as he said, ""just a couple of other little things I've done just trying to kinda .."" I don't remember how he worded after that...but basically, try to win her over.  I couldn't help it...I had to ask at this point what he got her for Valentine's Day.  He asked why it mattered, and I said I was just curious.  He said he just got her Godiva Chocolate Covered Strawberries, b/c it's her favorite thing.  He also mentioned she has a boyfriend.  And he STILL got her something!?!?  ANYway, even more unsettling b/c only a couple of days before I was at the mall, and I knew he'd be calling at any minute, just as I was passing Godiva, and thinking I'd go in and get a chocolate covered strawberry.  I was thinking how when he calls, he always says what's going on, or something like that, and my answer would have been, that I was in Godiva getting a choc. covered straw.  COMPLETELY unimportant, but kind of ironic that the thought had even occurred to me for WHATEVER reason, only to find a few days later that not only is that his ex's favorite food, but also that he got it for her for V'day.  I'm sure that would have been pretty wierd to him had I said that, though, at the time I didn't know it.  Again, it seems irrelevant, and I'm not sure what it is about that that feels wierd to me...it's just an indescribable thing.
Not much later, he was saying something again negative about himself, b/c of what his ex thinks, and I've been waiting for a couple of weeks for him to do it again, b/c it was a perfect segue for ME to say something.  He finally did, and I said something about that just b/c that's what ONE person thinks, and, admittedly by him, for a legitimate reason (he cheated on her and she won't take him back and has a new boyfriend), that's not a reason for such a low self-image, blah blah blah...all to lead into, ""I mean, seriously, I could easily feel the same way about myself for how shitty you are to me, but I don't..."" and b/4 I could finish, he actually cut me off to say he isn't shitty to me.
The thing is, I was saying it to make a point, but, truthfully, I expected him to ignore that point, and just be listening to the over-all OBVIOUS point I was making that he shouldn't let her opinion make him feel that way.  
Points for him, b/c, surprisingly, he actually backtracked to say that he wasn't shitty to me...I said he was...and we started talking about everything...which in the end led to me explaining, ""I'm okay with just hooking up, I'm okay with just being friends, I'm okay with seeing where something goes.  I'm okay with anyone of those 3 scenarios with ANYone...as long as the intentions are clear from the beginning, and you don't lie about it.  But why even SAY you want to get to know someone, or that you want to see where it goes, if you don't?""  
Mind you, a few times throughout the course of the evening, that had been brought up, and he never disputed it, just commented on some other part of the conversation, or whatever.  But suddenly, he decided he never said that.  (a month and a half ago, when we had the same conversation, he did the same thing, not denying it until it was mentioned several times, with him acknowledging it basically, in many ways, (not worth writing all of it...but other comments he'd make basically proved he DID say it), then, deciding later, he never said it.
I tried to remind him he did, about 100 times the first night, and many times since, blah blah blah.
I said, ""how do you remember it, then?""
He said, ""I don't know...I'm ...ugh...I'm just really tired right now..."" blah blah blah.
I said, ""Yea, you're always tired when you have to talk about this.""  He then went on to explain WHY he was so tired, and all of the events of the morning pertaining to his daughter, and when he was done, I complimented him on, ""another not so subtle successful attempt at changing the subject from a serious topic.""
He said no, that we would talk about it later, and I said if he would just take the 2 minutes to finish the conversation, it would be a closed issue, and he wouldn't have to talk about it later.  He again just said, ""WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT later, I promise.  I'm just really tired right now.""
The thing about that is that he will NEVER bring it up on his own, for sure, and if I bring it up again, then I just seem like the one who ALWAYS has to talk about that...and I'm smart enough to know guys don't like having these serious, intense conversations, especially about ""us"" pretty much ever, let alone every time you talk.  So there's a catch-22.   Anyway, as we were getting ready to hang up, I don't even remember what exactly he was saying, but it was something that was irritating me, and I just hung up on him.  Think he bothered to call back to at least say bye, see if I hung up or just lost service, or what the deal was?  Of course not.
So, I guess as it turns out, my shitty horoscope from last week around Valentine's Day was actually a week late.  I did find out the truth on some things, and, good or bad, I did need to know, as it said.  I guess it was my own fault for purposely trying to avoid real conversation that week for the sake of outsmarting fate, huh.
I hate him."

"event","That's all I'm asking for.  Be thinking about me as much as I think about you.  Be wanting to call me as much as I want to call you...want to talk to me, see me, be with me, as much as I do you.  Never will happen.  Never.  This is the reason why he doesn't call.  On his own.  Or, on nights like tonight, even to return my call.
I realize in all the time I've spent writing out these last couple of entries, you're probably thinking I could have also recapped the past 2 days events.  Truth is, I can't concentrate well enough on anything other than what I'm thinking and feeling to be able to remember and accurately recount the events and comments of the past days occurences.  So I will save it for a day that I'm able to do so, in a way that will hopefully help all to understand why it is that I think and feel the way I do right now.
Bastard.
Why is he such as ass?
Why did I not think he was before?
Why didn't I just let myself be totally single.  I was happy with that.  There was nothing wrong with that.  Things were going pretty well that way.  It wasn't until after ""the male"" came into my life that I felt like anything was not good.  I'll remember this next time, for sure.
Gotta make a mental note.  In bold letters.
To bed...for real.

"event","Yes, the ""her"" I am referring to would be ""the male's"" ex-girlfriend.  How, would you like to know, have I gotten to know her so well?  It's really quite simple.  
Because he talks about her ALLLLL the damned time.  And by ALLLL the time, what I mean is he LOOKS for reasons just to even mention her name.
I cannot wait to fill in all of the details of my drunken off and on 2 hour conversation with him last night, however, unfortunately, right now I'm exhausted.  However, we ended a fun, typical evening of joking and flirting tonight with him actually getting mad at me (I think) for the first time and hanging up on me.  Not just joking this time, either, I don't think, and DEFINITELY over nothing...over me joking with him about NOTHING.  You will all see what I mean, and agree with me, I'm SURE when I explain just what it was...along with all of the reasons I have to be mad at HIM, especially in light of last night's conversation.  Chris knows half of it...night QUITE all of it...but most.
He's driving me crazy and I really can't deal with this...in the past 2 days, for the first time EVER, he's actually given me feelings I haven't had since Craig.  And not the good kind, either.  I never wanted to be in the kind of situation I was in with Craig again, for the fact of the feelings I'd get.  Feelings of jealousy...intense, indescribable jealousy...the kind that literally makes you sick to your stomach, lose your appetite, and unable to sleep...that kind of jealousy.   I swore I'd NEVER be into a guy who was so shitty that I felt like that again, b/c it sucks.  And yet, here we are...and this guy actually had enough positive points in the beginning that the negative points he's been earning all seem so blurred, and, indeed, I'm becoming one of those stupid girls who sticks with a guy because ""when he's not an asshole, he's so nice"".  The thing is, I don't think he TRIES to be an asshole.  He just doesn't know he is...or can't help it...I dunno.  ANYway, I don't even know what, exactly, I'm jealous of, but defintely last night's conversation about the ex and his attempts to get her back sent feelings reminiscent of the nausea only Craig has ever induced soaring back to my stomach instantly.  And even still, I'm in that same strange state I used to often find myself in b/c of Craig.  It is indescribable and unexplainable, I don't even know what it is.  Just strange.  And I don't want to go to work tomorrow and see him.  But I don't want to go to work when he's not there, either.  It's not fun without him.  I can't concentrate with him.  How did it get to this point.  It's been soooo long since I let something get to this point, and with good reason.  At Hard Rock, it was so great, b/c I wasn't attracted to anyone there.  I could just go in, do my job, make my money, make a few friends, have a good time, and leave.  
I need to give some serious consideration to my move out west.  Maybe I should talk to Kara.  She'd be a cool person to come along.
I'll explain what has most recently brought on my feelings of frustration toward ""the male"" tomorrow.  
But for now, I have to go to sleep.  Or go to bed.  I'm hoping sleep will come.  Last night when it finally did, it was accompanied by dreams of him.  THAT'S what I need.
I wish I could be done with him.
To bed for now...

""Some Fools Never Learn""


All my friends say
I should leave you alone
You've got a heart like a stone
And a wandering eye
And I know that they're right

I could make up my mind
Not to see you again
But you move through my dreams like the wind
It's no good to pretend
It won't happen again
Cause it'll happen again

Chorus:
Some fools never learn
Play with the fire and you're gonna get burned
It's only love when you're loved in return
Some fools never learn
Some fools never learn

And baby I tried
But I'm just not that strong
Yes I knew all along
But that's not enough
I was falling in love

And you don't know it
But I came over tonight
There was somebody's car parked outside
Damn my eyes
Damn this heart of mine
I drove off into the night

Chorus

Somewhere in the city tonight
There's a girl (boy) and she's lonely like me
She'll be easy to see
And naturally
She'll have that look in her eyes
And she'll be feeling that way

I see it all plain as day
Oh I'll never be
What she wants me to be
Oh but lucky for me

Chorus

Some fools never learn"

"event","I'd like to begin this evening by thanking Chris for unwittingly supplying me with tonight's topic.

Indeed, it was almost over before it ""almost started"", seeing as how I'm thinking it never started...or at least, not like it was supposed to.  AND, just when I thought I was pretty sure I was ready for this to be done with, I found out today that his departure date has been post-poned by probably ANOTHER couple of weeks...if not almost a MONTH even.  ugh.  I just can't deal with this anymore.

Today was great; we were laughing and flirting and joking, as we have been all week at work.  (He COMPLETELY SOAKED my backside...mostly my ass...with the hose today b/c I took his hat...a little unnecessary, but funny still the same, as it's always fun for me to be able to enjoy his playful side.)But does that translate into any after-hours fun-or even conversation-no, not so much.  It'll be SO much easier to be over him when I'm not working with him anymore...having fun, and laughing with him, and, most of all, SEEING him.

Off to bed...up and at 'em early tomorrow morning to be in Northern Virginia (second time in a week) to take my car in to my mechanic...probably an ALLLLL day event.  grr.  But, then, hopefully off to spend some time with Chris and Kara, which would really be nice, in particular since Kara's been out of touch with me for a while, and the 3 of us haven't been able to hang out together in even longer still.

Also psyched about tomorrow night being Friends (one of the last 5 new episodes...and Rachel and Ross MIGHT get back together...), and also the new show, ""The Apprentice"", which, admittedly, I've become addicted to!  More psyched b/c I'll be OFF and able to watch them!  I'll miss Thursday night t.v. when Friends is over.  Pathetic, I know.  But it's like they ARE friends...they've been around for 10 years now...since I was in 7th GRADE!  PRACTICALLY grew up with them...and the show ALWAYS makes me laugh!  I REALLY am a little depressed about there never being any Thursday night Friends...no new episodes...no reliably entertaining television week after week after week.  Ok, that's even MORE pathetic, and I realize that, but, I've come to accept it, and have determined that being pathetic is a part of my destiny.  hehe

ok, to bed for real now!

"event","So, Monday and Tuesday, everything went GREAT at work, ESPECIALLY on Monday.  We were talking, joking, flirting, having a great time...so much so that it was to the point that virtually everyone there that day felt compelled to make SOME comment about the two of us, and more than once was that we should just screw and get it over with.  

I called him Monday night...he left a little after 5, I left a little after 6, so I knew he'd still be driving home, as was I.  We talked for a little while, then he came to the spot where he always loses service.  I told him to call me back when he got service.  He hesitated before saying, ""How about I call you back LATER.""  I instantly became annoyed, but joking said, ""What is with you and 'later'?"" to which he responded *NOT the first time he's used this response* that he just wanted to go home and relax for a couple of minutes.  
Nice.  
FIRST of all...you might as well just say I stress you out...though I don't know HOW, given that we never talk about ANYthing.  I would LIKE to think I'd be a PART of him relaxing.  Obviously, not so much.  SECONDLY, he ALWLAYS complains about hating being at his dad's, or having nothing to do, or whatever (which brings up another point, to be made in a minute), so why the sudden rush to be there doing nothing?  And, lastly, he used to go out EVERY night and have a few beers after work...CLEARLY not in a rush THEN to go home and relax.  Yes, most people would say, ""HEY STUPID, could it BE any more obvious...this is NOT working,"" and I would agree, but people would have to see the way things are the other half of the time, which of course, is what confuses me.  (on that note, VERY informative article I believe ALL men should read in Maxim this month...written by a lesbian about how to please a woman...and ALSO about SETTING A CLEAR DEFINITION of what the two of you are before sleeping together, b/c, as they so, even if you think it's obvious, SHE doesn't...and goes on to explain that ALL GIRLS OVERTHINK THINGS.  
Wonder if he reads Maxim.

ANYWAY...as far as the comment about living with his dad...things are only getting ready to get worse...
He probably moves this Sunday with the girl he's had plans to move in with for sometime now.  SOMEhow I managed to forget that I found out an important detail about a month and a half ago, but, good ol' Ray, he made sure to remind me about it yesterday.  About 5 years ago...he slept with her.  Funny thing is...he said about 5 years ago...before Nicole.  HOWEVER...He also said he was with Nicole for 5 years, and that they haven't been together for over a year now...actually, I think about a year and a half.  To ME...that doesn't add up to BEFORE Nicole.
EITHER way, CLEARLY the two of them at SOME point in time found each other attractive enough to hook up, and obviously they're still good friends if they are moving in together...and FURTHERMORE...this means they will be spending EVERY SINGLE night together.  AND again, I have yet to see this girl, so I have no idea whether she really is beautiful, or if they both just were drunk, and his idea of beauty was altered a little.  Although, he did make it a point TWICE now of letting me know he's slept with her.  And I don't know whether he did it intetionally to make me jealous, or just really is that dumb and inconsiderate that he didn't even think about what I would think.  (what was it that Maxim article said about girls overthinking things!?!  hehe)

ANYway, I've pretty much figured that in few weeks, this will all be completely over for good.
Well, on hiatus, until I do the Hagerstown opening in April.  (IF I do the opening.)
Then it definitely will be over and we probably will neither being seeing nor talking to each other again.

By the way, Monday night, I told him if he'd just call me back when he got service, he wouldn't HAVE to call me later; he said okay, we hung up, and guess what...he never called.  Bet that's a big surprise to all.

Yet, when I walked into work on Tuesday, he was all happy and smiley and nice, and ""good morning sunshine!!!""  like nothing was wrong, so CLEARLY he had NO reason for NOT calling, b/c he didn't appear to be annoyed/upset/irritated about anything.
*sigh*
Yesterday when I left work I called him (he had left the store to run to Bowie) and told him to call me when he left work that night...he seemed hesitant again, and I said it would only take a minute and a half out of his day...he reiterated what I said, and I confirmed, and he was like, alright, b/c I'm gonna have a $300 phone bill this month, b/c 700 of my 800 minutes are talking to you.  (ha...LIE...we've hardly talked at ALL this month.  LESS this month than any other so far, actually.)  ANYway...I told him if that was true, and he could show me his cell phone bill and prove that he went over his limit b/c of me, then I would pay it.  Well, he said he'd call me, and for once, he did...right at 5:30...soon as he left...just like the old days, when he ALWAYS called when he said he would. 
So I was at the mall, in Abercrombie, where it is really loud, and I only had one bar left of my cell battery, and by this time, I'd already had a few hours to think of how annoyed I was getting by him and all of his shenannigans, so when I answered, I said hello, he said, hey-what's going on? I said, nothing, can I call you back, he sounded very confused, and said...okaaaay...and I said bye.

Then around 7 I left the mall and called him back.  He answered, I said hey, what are you doing, he said just getting home...I asked why, and he said b/c  there was traffic, I said that sucked, then quickly said, alright, well, I was just calling you back b/c I said I would, not that I'm sure you were DYING for me to call you back, but do you work tomorrow?  he said yea, why? and I said, ok, I'll talk to you tomorrow...he REALLY sounded confused then, but, as usual, rather than asking questions, just said, uuuu...alriiiight..and I said, okay, bye, and hung up.

The thing is, I didn't intend for it to go that way when I initially told him to call me.  It was an afterthought.  I'd planned on telling him I wanted to hang out that night, b/c I figured it'd be my last chance to, b/c once he moves in with this girl, I'm sure I won't be seeing him anymore, and once he leaves Columbia, I REALLY won't be seeing anymore of him at all.  HOPING he'd ask why, then I'd explain, and HOPEFULLY he'd say it wasn't true, then I could bring up the point about how I don't believe it b/c almost 3 months ago, he said he wanted to get to know me and see where this goes, and so far he still knows NOTHING about me, and it's gone nowhere.  BUT, then I figured his dumb ass wouldn't say what I wanted him to...he'd be too focused on just saying something like, no, I'm not hanging out tonight, I'm too tired, and I just wanna relax...or say he was getting a headache, or whatever, and not really be paying attention so much to what I was saying as he would to not hanging out, which, of course, would only piss me off, AND would also prove that I was right, which would make it stupid for me to ask him to hang out anymore between now and when he leaves b/c he basically would have been admitting he didn't plan on seeing me after...so I'd look pathetic.  So basically, by the time I finished thinking all of this, I was REALLLLLY pissed at him.  Of course, I'm HOPING he's wondering what in the world I was up to, b/c I told him to call, then I didn't want to talk.  Probably not though.  He probably just thinks I'm wierd.  hehe  Either way, he clearly was confused, but still couldnt' even be bothered to ask why.
Whatever.

I'll see him for a minute today, but he'll be in a hurry to leave, b/c he picks up Parker on Wednesday nights after work.
This is so stupid.
I really think I wanna move to Colorado.
We'll see...

"event","I did it.
I called.
Why did I call?
What makes me do such incredibly stupid things?  Partake in such thoughtless, DUMB actions, which are clearly indicative of a most unfortunate lack of judgement.  A brief moment of indiscretion, and suddenly I'm participating in an irreversible, if not certainly regrettable, act.
I'm dumb. 
That's what it is.
22 years thinking it over and weighing the facts, and THAT, my friends, is the big conclusion I've reached.
I'm dumb.
Maybe I can PARTIALLY justify myself by explaining the events which led up to that dreadful moment in time, for which I'd give anything to take back and never have done.
Probably not.
But I'll give it a shot.
I got to work today.  I saw him.
He looked good.
REALLY good.
They always do that.
Why do guys do that?
It's like they purposely look good when you don't want them to.  When you need them not to.  
We passed each other a few times.  I looked at him closer.  He still looked good.  Maybe even more so than the ten minutes before.  
VERY light conversation...I can't even remember about what...it didn't last even 30 seconds.
It happened a few times.
Then I needed his keys.  I asked for them...I didn't know which one I needed, and he didn't tell me which one it was ... for a certain door...and we jokingly argued, yelling back and forth about how there weren't many there and I should be able to figure it out, and then me saying it would be much easier if he'd just told me...blah. blah. blah.  ANYway, we were in the back, and a few people heard us, and one of the cooks commented, ""I swear you it's like you two are married"".  
Yea, not so much.
Granted, I never want to BE married.  HOWEVER, just the comment made me think of how much fun it is when he and I ARE having fun, and joking, and flirting, and other people notice, b/c the attention we pay to each other is so obvious.
Later I threw something at him, he turned around, laughed, and jokingly started talking shit.  
We actually had fun again.
For a few minutes.
Then I got busy with my tables.
And an hour or so later, he left.
And tonight...just a little bit ago...I was weak, and when I got home, I called him.
Okay, not really a justification, I realize this now, and I did before I wrote it, too...I was just hoping maybe AFTER I wrote it it would SEEM more justified.
Turns out I was wrong.  
It still was a stupid thing to do.
Anyway, I left a message joking that I was just calling to wake him up, b/c I thought it was my turn, in reference to the fact that he did it to me last Saturday night at exactly the same time...(I called him around 1:45 a.m. tonight, after I closed, and he'd called me last Sat. around 1:30 on HIS way home b/c HE had closed.)  
However, the first time I called, it rang ALMOST enough times for his voicemail to pick up, but then disconnected.  At first I wasn't sure whether he'd actually tried to answer and something happened, or if the call just disconnected, or what.
Anyway, so I called again, figuring either he'd answer, if he'd tried to do so the first time, or his voicemail would pick up this time...either way, no big deal.
It rang this time 2 or 3 times...then was disconnected...but it almost sounded like maybe he picked up...but no one ever answered.
So, what do you think happened?
I called AGAIN.
At the time, my mind-set was that I was just joking around, and it would be funny to do to him what he'd done to me, and I'd call until I got his voicemail, so I could leave that message so he'd see why I called.  I was just focused on the fact that I wanted to either talk to him, or to make him laugh when he got the message, realizing I was doing the same thing back to him.  
I WASN'T thinking about how DUMB I looked calling THREE times in a row...OR how I shouldn't even have called ONCE...or, more importantly, about the possibility that he could have really ANSWERED and HUNG UP.  
Needless to say, now I'm freaking out.
I'm dumb.
WHY did I call?
WHY did I call again?
And the THIRD time?
UGh.
I should've just left a voicemail saying, ""Desperate and pathetic.  Call me.""
So, I still went ahead and left the message; I had to by THEN, so at least he'd hear in the morning the reason why I called THREE times in a row...but REALLY...is there ever a GOOD reason for THAT?!?  
I'm wondering now whether he's already listened to the message and just not called.  Or if he did hang up on me.  Though I don't know WHY he would.  I wonder, also, why everything is always FINE at work...we talk, joke, flirt, act like everything is great...but after work, it's all me, all the time.  I wonder if he even woke up when I called.  He HAD to have woken up.  Unless his phone was on vibrate.  But I don't feel like it was on vibrate.
My horoscope predicted NOTHING but bad things for me in my love life (the one that really has never existed to begin with) for the better half of the next week, starting with yesterday or today...so WHY, then, would I actually CALL him and attempt to make CONTACT with him of ANY kind, thereby increasing my chances of a really undesirable outcome?
What is WRONG with me?
I'm dumb.
Well, on the upside, I made some money at work tonight.  I tipped out almost $65, but I still walked with $215, going in at 4:00  I COULD have made $250 after tip-out...but some people don't know how to tip!  Oh well.
And after a night like TONIGHT...how do I ruin it?
By attempting to make contact with ""the male"".
UGH...I'm so DUMB.
And so angry with myself.  And with him.  Why can't he ever just CALL.  Would it be so bad?  Actually, maybe he shouldn't call.  There are days when I can really see myself NOT wanting to be with him...AND, better yet, I can almost ALWAYS realize that I don't want to be with him FOREVER, and I have NO problems seeing myself getting over him if I just moved away some place that seeing him wasn't an option.  It's more than I ever was able to do as far as Craig went.  With him, I always knew I didn't want to ever be WITH him, HOWEVER, I could never imagine myself moving somewhere and NOT wanting to come back and be with him for a little bit again.  
Maybe it'd be best if I never got to that point with this ""male"".  Easier, for sure.  
THAT is why I say dating and relationships are all a waste of time.  9 times out ot 10 you are not going to marry the person you are with.  If you don't plan on marrying them, then you just wasted valuable time that you could have been spending out meeting a potential husband, hanging out with friends, doing things and going places you wanted to go, or, just sitting at home on the couch after a long hot bubble bath, reading cosmo, painting your nails, watching ""Friends"", and eating chocolate.  Either way, you wasted your time, b/c you won't be with that person forever anyway, so why get attached, just to make it difficult, so that after all of the time you sacrificed to put INTO that relationship, you can sacrifice ANOTHER six months not wanting to hang out with anyone, or go anywhere, or meet new people, b/c you can't get over the last person you were never meant to be with!
Yep, I think it's better he doesn't call.
If I could just train myself to do the same.
Or move.
Ok, I've got to go to bed.
I think I'm supposed to be in NoVa to meet Chris for breakfast, (to meet her perfect fated boyfriend she reunited with while in Brussels, or whatever country she was in a couple of weeks ago), at 11:00 a.m.  Then I have to work at 4.
And when I get to work, OF COURSE he'll be there.  So I have to allow myself plenty of time in the morning when I wake up to make sure I can make myself look as presentable as possible, in case I don't have time to come home first.  But, before that, I have to make sure I allow myself enough time for my beauty rest.  I don't even know if we're still going.  I haven't heard from her since Friday morning, and I couldn't call her today b/c I didn't get out of work until 1:15.  My brother isn't home right now, so I can't ask him either.
Anyway, I guess I'll find out in the morning...
I'll be back to update how things go with him tomorrow evening!

"event","Pisces Lovescope Previous Week - Next Week  
Week of Feb. 9, 2004 by Astrocenter.com 
In the same way that you should watch out for telemarketers who are trying to make a buck by selling you something you don't need, you need to watch out for phonies who are after your kind heart and tremendous compassion - but who can't offer you the love and support you need in return. The beginning of the week will be filled with a great deal of fluff. The phonies are out in full force. If you are already together with someone, be careful of any promises made. It is not certain that this person will pull through. By the end of the week, however, you will be able to see the truth more clearly. You will have the ability to cut through to the heart of the situation and know exactly where you stand. On Valentine's Day itself, you will be met with a sobering reality. For better or for worse, this down and dirty version of the truth is exactly what you need to hear. 

Well, isn't that LOVELY.
Maybe on V-day he'll finally ADMIT what a jackass he is and, that, indeed, all he wanted was a ""beneficial friend"".
SH*Thead.  
I gave him that choice before.
HE was the one who ""wanted it to be more than that"" and ""wanted it to mean more"". 
Whatever.
Liar.
Men.
They're all liars.
EVERY one of them.
I hate them.
All of them.
Now I'm really pissed.
Especially at him.
It should be realllly easy not to talk to him...b/c now I'm even more mad. 
Thank goodness for horoscopes...at least then I know what to expect...and I know what he's thinking...even though I kinda already had an idea.
But I DEFINITELY won't talk to him on V-day...then he won't have the chance to say something completely sh*tty and ignorant!
Ok, NOW I'm going to bed...enough of this...

"event","Well, in case that doesn't give it away, for those of you who are a brain cell short of having no brain cells...allow me to explain in simpler terms which will make clear to you with no amount of uncertainty exactly what happened today...
HE DIDN'T CALL.
AGAIN.
CHRIS called.
Just to say hi.
EVEN though she KNEW I was at work...called JUST to say HI.
AND LEFT A MESSAGE.
*BTW...thanx Chris!  ;) *
My patience is REALLLLLLY growing thin with him
I'm not calling.
Luckily I got home too late tonight to call...b/c I believe he's already asleep...so if I call, he's not going to answer anyway, and he'll wake up and see that I called tomorrow, and not call me back...and I'll have to start all over being the strong one who doesn't care and doesn't call.
Right now I'm at 2 days.
That's really good.
I ended up picking up a shift tomorrow morning.
Didn't do it for the money ($20?)
Didn't do it cause I wanted to.
Didn't do it to be nice and help.
Here's why I did it.
So I'd be too preoccupied to pick up the phone and call him during the day, since I know he's off all day.  Today, that was easier than I'd anticipated, b/c I was up late last night, therefore I SLEPT all day...until work (p.s. thanks, also, Chris, for the good luck make $$ wish...it worked!)
So now, tomorrow, I work all day, and by the time I get out of there tomorrow night (same time as tonight), I know he'll be asleep again...b/c he has to work Sat. morning.
Sat. morning he works, I'm off, Sat. night I work he's off. Same thing Sunday.
Won't have to see him and not talk to him until Monday morning, when we both work.  Oh well.  
I'm not calling him.
I refuse to.
I hate this.
Really hate it.
I SOOO wanna call him.
So much stuff has happened at work (that no one else cares about, and, honestly, that includes myself, so I won't bother writing about it), but it's all stuff that normally I'd tell him about if I called.  The last two days I didn't have anyone I wanted to tell it to.
Ok, b/4 I make myself puke sounding all pathetic, like, ""oh how cute and perfect were we when we talked all the time""...that's not at all how it EVER was.  And it's not as if ""no one could ever take his place"".  
It's just that there are certain things about work that he and I always agree on, and talk about...or complain about...or whatever...and there's just not much point in discussing certain issues with other people.  Plus, a lot of it was always just an excuse to be able to call him after work, so I could vent. 
Now I don't need an excuse.
I need to remember the reasons NOT to call him.
Like, the fact that HE can't pick up the phone and call ME.
And the fact that I sit here thinking about HIM...but does HE ever sit at home, or drive home, and think about ME?  
DOUBT IT.
Jackass.
Ok, enough babble.
I'm just annoyed.
REALLY REALLY annoyed.
And maybe a little bit bummed?
And the last few nights at work, I've seriously been realllly bitchy and moody.  I hate it.  I BETTER not be acting like this b/c of HIS sorry ass!
Ok, well, off to rest, I have a long day ahead of me.

Sidenote:
It's been very lovely these past few days, knowing I wouldn't see him at work, therefore don't have to worry about wearing makeup, fixing my hair (not that I do TOO much of that...but I'm now down to not doing ANY of that), and, most importantly, not having to worry about skinny jeans, or what t-shirt color is and isn't working with my face that day.  In other REALLY exciting news...knowing I won't be seeing him after work also means I haven't had to worry about which underwear makes me look fatter...OR...MOST importantly...SHAVING!  I'm not disgusting yet or anything...but I haven't had to shave for 2 days!  Oh, it's so refreshing!

Ok, going to sleep now!

"event","UGH.
A**hole.
OF COURSE he didn't call.
Why WOULD he call...since I didn't call him...he had no REASON to call.
Well, for the record, my 20 minutes turned out only to be a mere 8.5 seconds...literally.  This was to my advantage, as well as my disadvantage.  Fortunately, I didn't have to see him AT ALL, which didn't allow me the time to give in, be pathetic, and talk to him.  I walked in to work, JUST as he walked by and said ""Bye Guys"" to everyone.  I didn't say bye.
I doubt he noticed.
But I know.

ANYway.  The downside of that is that, like I said, I doubt he noticed.  So he probably doesn't even REALIZE that I ignored him...completely IGNORED him...for a whole DAY.  So OF COURSE he didn't call to find out why.  Not that he would have anyway.  AND not that he couldn't just call just to call.  Would it kill him?  SERIOUSLY.  AND I STILL don't know why he called yesterday while I was at work, though obviously it wasn't THAT important, because he STILL hasn't called me back from THAT message.

grr.

I seriously hate men.  WHY do I EVEN bother?  He really is turning out to be a COMPLETE waste of my time.  Though I didn't think he would be, and I still like to think he's not.
Anyway, in a couple more weeks I definitely won't be seeing anymore of him anyway.  He'll be moving to Frederick, and working in Hagerstown (sure, NOW he'll work at another store...now that things are already NOT working out enough that there's not much point in us TRYING to make things work out now that we're ""allowed"" to see each other like normal people).  Anyway...
He'll have a female roommate, whom I haven't met, and, incidentally, have no visual image of, so, as far as I'm concerned, I have valid reason to be jealous, b/c for all I know, he could be all about her...and just may come home drunk one night.  
Who knows.
He's a guy.
AND when he starts working in Hagerstown we'll have NO time to see each other anyway...b/c it's SO far away...and he has 2 days off...one of which is already taken every week.  The other ... I wouldn't count on being saved for me.
SO...I'm basically just trying to milk what I can out of these last couple of weeks of whatever this bullshit is that we are (or are not) doing.  At the very least...I'll have a bed buddy for a coupld of weeks.  But, then again...not even that at the rate he's going.
Okay, off to bed. 
I'm soooo tired...
I'm getting too old for this job!

"event","Okay, I wasn't going to do this either, (although, yes, I won't lie, I HAD thought about it), but I was afraid it may be a bit cheesy.  However, since Chris did it, AND said HER friend did it...well, dammit...I'm gonna do it, too.
Here are my lyrics for the day:

Ryan Tyler
""Run, Run, Run"" 

I didn't want it to go this far
I didn't want you to get to me this way
I didn't want you under my skin
I don't need a broken heart again
Don't you know you're tempting me 
With something almost irrestible
I just wanted something casual
I didn't want you to be wonderful

So I gotta run run run 
Get away Get away
Far away from your love 
Don't follow me follow me
A million miles from you baby
It's the only thing that's gonna save me
So I gotta run 


And the other one:

Nickelback
""Someday""

How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able 
To see the signs that we missed
And try to turn the tables
I wish you would unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

Nothing's wrong just as long
As you know that someday I will
Someday somehow 
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday somehhow
I'm gonna make it alright 
But not right now
...

Alright...so there are your thoughts for the day!
Enjoy!  :)"

"event","Well...the countdown begins...5 hours and 9 minutes until I have to see the male for 20-30 minutes...at which point I will be forced to summons all the will power alloted to me intended to last my entire lifetime...all for the sake of maintaining my cool attitude toward him...and ignore the lousy S.O.B.  Willing to place wagers with those stupid enough to bet against me that he STILL won't call on his own tonight just to say hi...or find out why I didn't speak to him and see what might be wrong.  HOW did I EVER think he was wonderful?

A friend of mine actually called from Orlando yesterday wanting me to move into a townhouse with her in Avalon Park...aka PERFECTville.  This came the day after I BEGGED God to give me a way to get away from the male problem without having the option of contiually going back...like I always do.  Anyway...last time this happened was with Craig...EVERYone remembers HIM...and I had the chance to move to Massachusetts...and DID.  Funny thing was...a year later...after I'd moved back...he got the chance to move there, too...and DID.  lol 
Anyway...I was actually considering it...not that I'm not still *and not that I don't love where I'm at...but I've been here for 6 months...and it's time to start looking anyway...AND...I'm getting FAT...I need some warm weather so I can start going to the beach and losing weight*...but the only problem is the work issue.  Can't really work at Waterford Lakes again...SO many reasons THERE...and wouldn't work at any other Orland LoHo...cause there's no money...and I don't PARTICULARLY want to go back to Hard Rock....although, to be honest, I still haven't ruled it out.  Anyway, she's looking into other roommate options in the meantime, and if she finds one, then I'll know it wasn't meant to be!
I've worked out now twice since Saturday...so that's good.  You'd never know it by looking.
arg.
well anyway, I'm off to take my shower and make myself presentable...even if I'm ignoring the guy, I still gotta look my BEST...I don't want him to be RELIEVED I'm not talking to him...lol...I want him to be WISHING I'd talk to him...won't happen looking the way I do now!
Back later...

"event","I had a really great idea for this first entry...kind of to make fun of myself and my situation while simultaneously catching up those of you who are unaware of the basic problems in my love life (or lack thereof).
However, it occurred to me that in this day and age (this being the era of modern technology...hence the online journal for friends and strangers alike to read) it would be too easy for any specifically mentioned persons to identify themselves and their stories while doing random online searches for goodness only knows what else they may have been looking for. (thus turning me into this ""complete freak"" I once knew kind of story...""she was crazy...went online and told our whole story to the world""...yada yada yada...yea.  I don't want to be HER.)
So, I opted instead, to go the regular route of filling you all in on all of the real details in person, or, in most cases, via e-mail or telephone...and not so much snail mail, as that is nearly a thing of the past...although, Chris, I did print out my original copy of this entry, if you'd like, I can mail it to you...there is a chance, *though on a scale of 1-100 I'd rate it slim to none* that it just might make you laugh.  Or crack a smile.
However, those of you who wish to avoid my signature daily story telling sessions (which sometimes ... okay, usually...tend to go on and on, oftentimes seemingly with no point, nor end in sight, as I drift aimlessly on from topic to topic, each without finishing the last, until, finally, you're worn out and can't take anymore)...may catch up on my daily happenings in the cliff notes version to be found on this website...correction...LIVE JOURNAL.  hehe
Anyway, as of tonight...my will power is strong...I will not call the uncaring, thoughtless, inconsiderate, lying, sh*tty male until he chooses first to call me.  Although, I thought for a minute I may have made progress earlier this afternoon when I left work and saw that he had called ME (not returning my call...b/c I never called this time!), but, alas, there was no voicemail message, and, when I called him back to see what he wanted, wouldn't you know I got his voicemail.  And, naturally, the ba*tard never called ME back.  That's fine.  I'm so done with this stupid game.  It's really not even fun anymore.  Seriously.
It's all about getting laid.  Of course, when that was all I wanted 2 1/2 months ago...he had to give me the whole story about how he wanted to get to know me, and see where this went, and a whole bunch of other blah blah blahs.  Yea, WHY couldn't he just be a guy and be happy he was going to be getting sex from a girl with no strings attached!?!  Why did he WANT strings.  Or want to lie about wanting strings.  What was the POINT in that!?!  Well, the one thing I DO know is that now, 2 1/2 months later, he knows NOTHING about me.  Seriously.  NOTHING...Except that I'd never have a threesome and don't plan on ever having a boob job.  Yea.  THOSE are the questions he asks.  And then we talk about work.  Alot.  That's it.  Wow...Good thing we've had so long to ""get to know each other better"".  Suddenly sex with him doesn't feel so cheap and for the hell of it.  It's like it suddenly feels so meaningful and fulfilling.  Like we're completely connected.  Like there's so much more to what we have than just a physical relationship.  Wow.  It's amazing what that 2 1/2 months has done for us.  How close it's brought us. <rolls eyes>
Ugh.  
I mean, like I said, I was ok with it being what it is...if he wouldn't have acted like he wanted to make it what it never will be...because he never tried.  AT ALL.  I hate men.
I think I wanna go somewhere.
Anybody wanna go somewhere?  
I think I have to see him for about 20 minutes tomorrow.  Great.  
I'm ignoring him.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

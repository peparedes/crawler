"event","I'm dedicating this entry to the memory of Raquel--Rach as she perferred to be called taken from us in a car crash Saturday night at the tender age of 14. I will miss your craziness, your bad spelling, your dedication to Kirk, how much you loved Sofi. My thoughts and prayers are with her family her friends and too all the girls on the board. I listened to fade to Black in her memory thou now that song will always have significance to me, It'll probably make me cry when i hear it.
I just wish this was just some sort of nightmare and i could wake up....my heart is breaking so much right now is it possible to love ppl even thou you've never met them???? All i can say is i hope that she's in heaven rocking it up with Cliff and he's taking damn good care of her....cos lord knows she deserves it she was one heavy rocking chicklet i'll miss ya sweetheart R.I.P Rach R.I.P."

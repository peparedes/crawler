"event","Wow LiveJournal, its been a long time since I've written in here. Soild two weeks. Almost a record, maybe. Anyway, a lot of interesting stuff happened to me. First off, Valentine's Day wasn't as badd as I thought. Spent some time with friends, so it was cool. Second, my cousin invited me to play Church League Softball again, so I'm gonna give that a throw and see whats up. I started talking to an old friend. Things are better now. I've grown up some, too. Which is scary, two weeks, and I feel 10 years older sometimes. You'll have that, though. Went on my first observation yesterday. That was awesome. I was at the school that my brother-in-law, RJ, teaches at. The teachers all knew me and were very kind to me. Being there made me wanna teach even more. All the stuff they were going over, I knew. And I could teach it with no problem. Just be around teachers as a future colleague instead of as a current student is so much nicer. I can't really describe it, its just....different. So, anyway, on to my main point of this post:
I talked to Julie tonight. Lately, we've been a little distant. I've been to the house once since I went drinking with them. And we've talked every now and then online. But its not like it used to be. We are both so busy now, with studying, friends, me working, and her being more involved with Phi Sigma Sigma, that we haven't had much time to hang. So I sent her a message tonight. We talked a little bit. She told me how she is happy now, and things are going good for her. I told her that I was happy for her and that she deserves only the best. (Now, for those of you that don't know Julie, everything I said is 100% true. And if you argue with me, I'll kill you.) Anyway, back to the story. We talked a bit, then Julie said something that almost made me cry.(Now, I'm a big strong man, and I don't normally cry. But this got me emotional, so back off.) She said, ""im sorry if i ruined things with us"".(Sorry Jewelez, had to quote you). Hold the phone a second. I'm still talking to her and she wants to apologize. I think not. Sweetie, you are Italian and you are beautiful. The only thing you need to apologize for is the corrective surgery every man has to get after one look at you because his jaw hit the floor too hard and BROKE! Anyway, there was nothing to apologize for. And I told her so. And I'm gonna tell her so again, right now. 

Julie, there is nothing that you need to apologize for. You didn't ruin anything. If you had, we wouldn't be talking and I wouldn't be writing this wonderful story about you. I know we haven't spoken much lately, and that is because I am a badd Squishie. Badd Squishie, badd. But seriously, I want you to know that I was never once mad at you. Everything that happened was my fault, not yours. And I just want you to know that no matter what happens, 'I'll always be here for you, kiddo.' You've helped me so much this year here at Clarion that I'll never be able to repay. And you are a fool if you think one lecture from you is gonna make me run away. Thats not what friends do. I appreciate everything you've done for me. I just hope that someday, I'll be able to return the favor. You are a jewel, Jewelez(nice choice of words, ain't it ;)!) You are a true friend and an absolutely ""uber""-terriffic person. Don't ever let anyone tell you different. 

So you get the picture, right? Even when Julie thinks she did something wrong or ruined something, it wasn't her. It was the other person. That person being me. So, anyway, now I'm super-happy that I've got my friend back and she is happy. And even though we are still busy as hell, I will always find time to spend with her. Because, without her, I wouldn't be here right now, suffering through college. Julie is an inspiration to me. A beautiful girl, a ray of light, but most importantly, a good friend. 

Well, ladies and gentlemen. It is getting let. I have a few things to do before I go to bed. So I will end this post here and leave you with this thought: When travling through life, its not where we end up or how we got there that defines us, but instead, the people who rode along. Good night."

"event","Well, what an interesting time of year. February. Supposedly the month of lovers, you know, with Valentine's Day and all. Which got me to thinking, I wish I had someone to spend that day with. That would be cool. But alas, I have no one. I will most likely spend Valentine's Day alone, or getting for the day after when I have my observation. I really wish I could meet a girl to spend time with. I mean, I am spending time with this one girl, but we are just friends who get bored. She's cool. Good to talk to. She got me thinking a LOT about someone else(Tiffany, surprise surprise). Still don't know if thats good or not. I just hope that she is o.k. I saw her over the weekend. I wish it were on better terms. The only thing I wanted to do was put my arms around her and tell her everything would be o.k. But thats not my job, nor my place, to do that. Such is life.

I remember when I was there for my friends. When I supported my friends and sympathized with them. Where am I now? Sometimes I'm no where to be found. That isn't a good thing. Maybe that's why people quit turning to me in the first place. I wasn't reliable. 

I started listening to this Christian band my cousin introduced me to. They are called Mercy Me. I was surprised at how good they were. When one of my friends heard it in my car, they asked why I was listening to it. I said, ""Things change, so do I."" I'm thinking that religion may not be such a badd thing. But I don't know. I'm looking into it. We'll see how that goes. 

I'm more open now, I think, than what I used to be. More mellow, too. I realize that time here is short, and you never know when it will be taken from you. You also never know what life may bring you, but it is guarenteed to hold some surprises. Kat's story is a funny one to me, but it also showed me that life has its own little bag of tricks. And it doesn't mind throwing one at you every now and then. 

Here is a hypocritical thing to say, but here it is anyway. A while back, I got myself into somethings that could get me kicked out of the program I am enrolled. The sad part is, I don't care. Some people are upset with me for doing them, and some people encourage it. Fact is, I feel better when I'm doing what I want. A bad way to run from things, but the euphoric feeling I get is unparalleled by anything else in my life. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough. But I strongly believe that when I am under the influence, I'm detached and not as depressed. Therefore, I may(note the word ""may"" and how it in no way relates to be definate) choose to become a regular. I don't care how I act or what I say. The only thing I really care about is the detachment from reality. And until something else does that, or lifts this moderate depression, I may consider making such activities part of a regular routine. 

I accordance with the last section, may I just add that I love the taste of Jack Daniels........

I have my car back on campus finally. I spent so much money on it. I hope nothing else goes wrong with it. I'll be uber-pissed off. But, its good to know that I have transportation if I need it. Sad thing is, I don't have many friends, so I don't have anywhere to go. Haha, I'm such a loser. 

Well, its off to bed for me. I'm not real tired, but if I don't go to bed now, I may not want to go to class. That isn't a good thing since I've missed every class this week. Until next time, remember this: its not only what you say, but how you say it. Peace......"

"event","Wow. My life. Nothing but a roller coaster. What goes up, must come down. First law of physics. Things were going really good, then they went badd. Now, I couldn't even describe it. I wish I were more out-going. Oh well. I had a nice talk with Tiffany tonight. We straightened some stuff out. She opened my eyes a bit, too. It was good times. I told her that I wanted her to throw my ashes in a garbage can when I die. She was more into throwing them behind the rink where we used to skate. We'll see how that goes. Anyway, I'm gonna stop this post because I am boring and I am really tired. Until next time: Stop being a pussy. Get out there and meet someone."

"event","Well, I've had an interesting weekend so far. It started on Thursday because I was baked, hammered, and miss class on Friday from staying up to late. It was fun. I got to break into my bottle of Jack Daniels and have a good time. I spent time with a good friend. The only downside to the whole thing is I guess some things happened and I gave off the wrong impression or something. Don't get me wrong, I like her, but I know better. I don't have a shot in a relationship right now with anyone I don't think. But thats my fault. I just wish things were back to normal. I don't like sitting around thinking about what next time will be like. Let me tell you something. If you are under the influence of some substance, be it alcohol, marijuanna, pain killers, you should not try and be close to someone else who under the influence of one of those substances. Things could get weird. And it sucks. Sometimes, no check that, all the time, I do the dumbest things. Things I know I shouldn't do, things I know have consequences, but I still do them. I've got a lot to learn about college. Then there is last night. I got confused, then angry, then sorry. It sucked. Drinking vodka didn't help at all. Talking to her would have made everything better, but that wasn't going to happen. Time to move on to other things. I haven't learned my lesson by now, which is sad. But the day will come when I understand why I get shit on sometimes. That probably isn't whats happening, but its my perspective of whats happeneing. I'm the one thats making most of the mistakes, so its prolly all me, but oh well. I totally skipped Friday. I played Designated Driver all night. It was fun. I wish I had been drinking, though. I needed something that night. Hell, what am I talking about. I'm so fucked up, I need something every night. There is a time and a place for everything, though. Thats what the weekend is for. Anyway, I'm bitching too much right now, so I'm gonna go clear my head and maybe I'll post a little something later. So until next time: I'm sorry if I've disappointed you. I'm sorry if I've disappointed anyone. It wasn't my intention, but then again, we all know I'm not much more than a fuck up anyway."

"event","O.k., so I'm back in Clarion. At first, I thought it was going to be awesome. But there is something missing. Other than my roommate, anyway. A feeling....maybe of belonging? I didn't feel it in Greenville. But I don't feel it here, either. Maybe that's because I just got back and I have adjusted yet. Well, I'll have to work on that one. Anyway, I spent some time with Jewelez, Bridgy, and Bob tonight. What a blast. There is no one that can put a smile on my face like Jewelez and Bridgy. Its good to know I have friends down here who accept me for me. Its hard being around Jewelez sometimes. Don't get me wrong, she is an AMAZING person. But when you have feelings for someone, you do everything you can not to let them get in the way of your friendship. Over break, it died down. I talked to her, but I didn't see her. So it was easy. Seeing her, though, that makes it rough. She has a totally stellar personality and a body that makes me weak. Now mind you, I can say no to anyone, anytime, anywhere. But she just has this way about her that makes me not care. I don't want to say no. Yes, I know. I'm whipped and I'm not even getting any. But besides the fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous and is a BLAST to be around, there is one other thing that makes her so monumentally attractive. She is simply one of the nicest people I've ever met. From day 1, Jewelez was there, no matter what I needed. Even if some things were an inconvience for her, she did them anyway. She took time out to make sure I was o.k. She knew I was having a rough time with the whole Val thing and being at college for the first time, so she made the time to check in on me. With everything that I've gone through this semester, Jewelez is the reason Im' sitting in Clarion right now. If it wouldn't have been for her, I would most likely have transferred or dropped out. Thanx Jewelez....I owe you big time!

So, I'm in college. I am in debt and forever will be in debt. I hate it. Such is life. Being in Greenville brought a startling revalation. When you graduate from a small town like that, you don't belong when you come back. So, I'm tired of trying to belong. Making something there thats not. That part of my life is over and I'm moving. If people want to keep in touch, fine. If not, don't expect me to call you. I'm glad I have Hillary. The little part of my sanity that will never go away. She was my anchor to reality for so many years, and now, she is my anchor to the past. She reminds me of who I was and helps me remember what I can be. Having a friend like Hillary is something that I will cherish forever. No matter where life leads me, she'll be there. I didn't get to see a lot of people over break. But the only person I regret not finding time to see is her. I am going to make a promise, though. No matter how busy I am or how far away I go, I will always be able to do two things. I will never lose contact with you for any extended period of time and I will always find a way to get to you if you need me, just like you always did when I needed you. Thanx for everything you have done for me, Hill. You have impacted my life for the better. 

Well, enough of my deep thoughts for one morning. I need some sleep. I have an 11 o'clock class and I still have to buy books. Until next time: the word ""Italian"" describes many beautiful things, first and foremost is you. Ciao Bella."

"event","Let's all hope this year is awesome. One thing that bothers me about people talking about 2004 is they haven't lived in 2005, yet. And what they did in 2004 was what they truely wanted at the time. At least, thats supposed to be how it works. So instead of saying how I want this year to be better than last, I'll just tell you what I want. Its much more fair; everything could always use improving. So, anyway, the first thing I want is good grades. I want to be able to have a job when I graduate. I also wish luck to my friends. Some of them need it, and some of them are lost without it. I want to make time to relax. There hasn't been much of that for me lately. Sometimes I just feel so tired. I want to drink more. I know people think its dumb, but I'm tired of fighting my problems or my fears. I would rather drown them in poison. Haha!<-(You don't have to tell me. I know I'm funny) I hope I have the chance to learn more from my sister. With age comes wisdom. Unfortunately, my sister and I had to grow up too fast. There are still a great many things she can teach me. I want to learn how to ignore people and learn how to say no. I'm tired of doing every single thing people ask me without getting anything in return. I hope that I learn how to control situations better. I want to feel comfortable with someone. Feel like I'm at ease, not working at anything. Just be carefree. 

Off of New Year's ""resolutions"" or hopes though, I had a good time with my friends from work. I wish I would have had someone to kiss when the ball dropped. Hey, maybe I can make up for it later today. Doubt it, but who knows. Anything is possible. I did drink. One can of beer, but thats all we really have except wine(blah!). I'm waiting two weeks anyway. The three day weekend is going to kick ass. I hope I don't remember any of it. But who knows. Anyway, I'm off to do some work. Leave me some or call me. I could use some New Year's cheer from anyone willing to offer. Until next time: I hope everyone made at least one resolution that they will keep. I did."

"event","No matter how much I try, I just can't put things out of my mind. I guess I just stay up too late and think about things. Anyway, there are a ton of things I was thinking about and a ton of things I wish I had never done in my lifetime. There are a great many things I wish I could talk about. Many things I wish I had done. So many things I wish had gone differently. It is the never-ending quest to give your life some meaning. Anyway, I said somethings yesterday or today, whichever, that I shouldn't have said, but things I'm glad I did. I'm glad that I told someone how I felt. I'm tired of hiding feelings. I always do what I think is right for others and my feelings always end up getting pushed to the back burner. I hope she sees that she can do better than what she has currently. I hope she sees that there is someone who can treat her better. We talked, and I know she's not happy. I can make her happy. Happier than what she is now. Anyway, I should prolly end this now, before I say more than what needs said. Most of this post, but not all, is mindless rambling From someone who is dead tired. I am certain of one thing, though. I could treat her better than anyone ever has, if she would just give me a chance.

"event","Wow, I waited like 4 days between posts. Very uncharacteristic. Not really. I just wanted to make sure that people were going to listen to me and not leave stupid ass comments. They did, and I'm glad. So, Christmas went good. I got some clothes, some money for my transmission, and an X-Box. Totally stoked about that. Been playing that thing way too much. Its pretty sweet. I've also been making a lot of money at work. Hopefully, by the time I go back to school, I will have given my dad enough money to get my car fixed that week, so when I come home that weekend or the next, I'll have it. I miss my car. So good on gas and its got a CD Player in it. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about a lot of stuff. Why be a hater? I know some people on this earth are worthless, but why spend time hating them? Its just wasted energy. Right? Then I remember it feels good to be angry when people piss you off. I guess you don't have to hate people, just be pissed off. I shouldn't use the word hate. Its too strong. Sometimes it may be fitting, but it leaves you with regrets in the end. I've also been thinking that a lot of what I write in here is just babble, but it helps me vent. Thats what this thing is for anyway. I went back and read most of my entries and some just don't make sense. I'm sure that when I'm done with this one, it will sound a little odd. Thats o.k. though. I've done something thinking about New Year's, too. I can't get hammered and I am sad about that. Yet another New Year's I spend not being plastered and another one I will spend not really doing something that makes me happy. Until 11, I will be working, then we play D&D. That will be fun, but no kiss when the ball drops, no liquor to make me smile and feel warm. Nothing. Then, New Year's Day, I get to play again. At some point between the time I go to sleep and the time I wake up, I'll drink, and possibly get plastered. I just think it would be more fun to be plastered heading into a New Year. 

Speaking of the New Year, I should prolly make some resolutions. I've got two easy ones. First, I NEED to start working out. I'm gonna end up all fat and gross cause all I do is sit around and eat. Second, I must get my grades up this semester. I'm lucky enough to have my sister buying my books again, but if I don't get better grades, its over. Yes, I know I'm a spoiled rotten brat, but she works hard for her money and she pretty much raised me. Out of every parent I've ever met, she is the best. I'm glad she wants to take care of me and help me make something of myself. Means a lot to me. Never really got that kind of support from anyone else. I'm sure there are other resolutions I can make for this next year, but I don't really care. I should be nicer to people, but fuck that. Life isn't fair and people aren't nice, so why try? I'm all about not wasting my energy on unimportant endeavors. I am all about wasting my energy on someone, though. And regardless of whether it gets me anywhere or not, I might just try it anyway. Anything is worth a shot. Besides, I don't have much to lose. I could also resolve to make friends. That might be something important. Maybe even worth considering, but its not a priority. Also, I should stop intentionally ruining people's lives. Wait, I don't. Damn, I thought I was on a roll. I know I've heard that somewhere. Oh well. I resolve to be happier. I resolve to be wiser and see things how they are and not how I want them to be. It will save me a lot of pain and anguish to listen to that last one. I resolve to make Clarion as much of a home as possible. I don't belong in Greenville, anyway. And there is only one group of people that really want me here to begin with. So, this is now just a town I visit. And Clarion is my home. 

Resolutions get boring after a while. The cool thing about them is, if you break one, you only break a promise to yourself. That I can live with.

I've been doing a lot of contemplating on the word trust. I realize that trust needs to be earned. Someone had my trust at one point, but they decided to blame certain things on me that were slanderous and entirely untrue. So trust is now gone. I may chose to start from scratch with everyone. But we'll see. I will definately be more careful about entering relationships, though. If I can't trust the person I'm thinking about spending time with, then it really isn't worth it. I don't want them trying to deface my character just because they are mad at me. I know that I wasn't the ""best"" person in the world all the time. I admit that to people. In school, I could have been a better person to a lot of people. But one thing I was respected for was I did anything to protect the people I cared about. Then I had that used against me. Makes you wonder about the human race, doesn't it? Would we be where we are today if the bible were different. If Eve hadn't been a bitch and fucked Adam's life up hardcore? Sorry, that sentence has a double meaning. Anyone that figures out what the fuck I'm talking about there can talk to me. But only if you're a non-hater. This is a no-haters club. Meaning any hater that posts will be subject to occasional scanning of the comupter by third parties and even potential hacking by a genius. Or more-likely, I'll just post evil and hateful things about known subjects. I'm just childish like that and love to have fun. So, until next time: have a safe and happy new year. And if you are one for drinking, throw one back for me cause I'll be at work. Don't drink and drive."

"event","Well, you're always going to have critics, right? And there are always going to be people who can't be like me, can't deal with shit themselves. Too badd for them, I guess. But hey, its Christmas Day. The day of forgiving. Well, I can't go that far. I can forget, but not forgive. I've been thinking about stuff all day. And I'm wondering two things. First off, why do people open their mouths and yammer at me about shit they have no idea about? Must be the pretty face. Can't find anything nice to say to me, but they still have that urge to talk to me. I wish....but one can dream, can't he? The other thing I've been thinking about is, why is it that people feel the NEED to read my livejournal if they are just going to get pissed off or defensive about something I've said? There is a real simple solution to their problem. See, if they didn't read this, they wouldn't have anything to be upset about. For a bunch of people who want nothing to do with me, they sure make it a point to keep up on my personal life and make comments about what is going on. Oh well, my fan club I guess. You'll have these things, I suppose. At first, it was entertaining. Then, it became aggrivating and upsetting. Now, its just plain annoying. Tough luck for me, right? I just have to get used to dealing with twelve year olds. I mean, I am gonna teach someday as long as my grades get better. Speaking of which, that should be real fun trying to pull them up. I know I'm intelligent, I just find that I'm not very motivated. I'm thinking thats not a good thing in college. I got a 2.4 GPA this semester. Not good. I need somewhere between a 2.8 and 3.0 average to be a teacher. Time to start bustin' my ass. I don't feel too badd about my grades, though. I know someone that did worse. Actually, I know a lot of people that did worse. But I know a few who did better. That bothers me. I need to get better grades. I'm better a better person than my actions show from senior year and first semester at Clarion. I can do better in school. I can do better for myself outside of school. I can make better decisions. 

I've noticed something about myself. I'm very fickle. My mind changes about things way too often. Sometimes, I think college is important and I need to buckle down and get good grades. Other times, I just have this feeling that tells me its not important and I can't make anything of myself, anyway. Now, I sure as hell know that isn't true. But still, sometimes, you just feel that way. I have mixed emotions about my last relationship. There are times when I've said it was a good thing, and times that I regret it. I've been thinking about how I actually feel about it, and its a toss up. For every item I can put in the ""good"" column, there is one that I can put in the ""bad"" column. Is that normal? There are some relationships you know were just garbage, and some that you kick yourself for getting out of. This one though, I think I'm indifferent right now. Undecided. That bothers me. I should be able to look back and say decisively that ""this was a good thing"", or that ""it was a bad thing"". I can't do that yet. Interesting, but disturbing. 

I'm not as alone in Clarion as I thought I was. I mean, yea, there are the guys in my hall who are totally sweet. And my sister(and my savior) isn't far away. But now I realize that I have her soroity to go to if I need something because of Jewelez. Its nice to feel loved, and there ain't no better friends on earth right now than the sisters of Phi Sig. Speaking of Jewelez, I've prolly said this a thousand times, and I'm prolly gonna say it a thousand more. She is the best friend to have at Clarion. No matter what I said, who I pissed off, Jewelez was right there, backin' me up. Now, I dunno if anyone knows anything about Italian women, but they are definately the kind of woman you don't EVER want to piss off. EVER! I am totally stoked by the fact that she has my back. And I feel sorry for the poor shlub that pisses her off. I've seen her angry, so I'm totally happy we're friends. Things may get crazy when we hang out, but she is definately one of the best people I know. And then there is my RA Joe. What a clown that kid is, but he is funny as fuck. He lives like 6 miles away from me, but going to Clarion was the first time I met this kid. What a farmer. I got respect for the guy, though. Being an RA ain't easy. And some of the shit he says about the people that come to visit me is just fucking priceless. I wish I had a recorder so I could catch it. 6 South in Nair Hall is the sweetest place to be. The people are amazing, the good times NEVER end, and the best part is, we'll all be together next year. 

I've been thinking about the mistakes that I've made in my life. Unfortunately for me, there are too many to count. I realize that no matter how hard I try to do the right thing, I always end up doing something wrong. I need to stop trying to make everyone happy. I live my life so that others will be happy. Fuck that! I need to start doing things that make me happy. Going to sharon to see Tiffany for no apparent reason than to look at her, that made me happy. Yes, seeing Keri was definately worth the trip as well. ;). Doing the nocturnal thing, getting up at 4pm and going to bed at 7am, that makes me happy. Spending time getting hammered with friends, or just spending time with friends, that makes me happy. What doesn't make me happy? How about defending my life to people who have no business sticking their nose in it. Arguing with people who don't have a fucking clue what the problem is to begin with or haven't been told everything. Taking things off the internet for people who don't have respect for themselves, let alone anyone else. Hey, thats all behind me, though. From now on, I do what makes me happy, fuck those people who aren't important. I am Squishy, dammit. Wow, that is definately a story for another time. Anyway, its almost 7AM, and I need some sleep. So, until next time: what is the craziest thing you've done lately?"

"event","I wish I lived in a movie. I jsut got done watching ""The Girl Next Door"". Talk about every guy's dream. Total must see. Anyway, it got me thinking. In the movie, the kid falls in love with a porn star. Ya, I know, total bullshit. To top it off, the kid was a geek until he met her. She ""changed his life"". Anyway, it was a typical movie plot for the most part. But it had more twists and turns. It didn't just show Two people coming together, getting driven apart, only to get back together in some touching way. It showed the work a relationship takes. And how much effort has to be put forth in order to maintain that relationship. Totally true, I might add. There is some good shit in that movie if you look closely enough. I mean, the movie had the fairy tale ending and all, but it was still good. And almost true. See, here lies the problem. I've been in that kid's situation. I had someone that changed my life when I met her. We were together for a short while, then we split up. Difference between me and the kid in the movie is my ""dream girl"" didn't live next door. Things were hard. I dunno what happened. We've grown apart since then, at least, thats what I've noticed. So, I'm alone again. Nothing new there. Just makes me wonder, where is the girl that is gonna change my life? Where is the girl that is going to make my jaw drop and make my world stop? Well, the hunt goes on, I guess. Oh well, Its 6:30AM and I'm real tired. So, I'm gonna head out. Night."

"event","Ain't that the way life goes? You get dealt a shitty hand and have to play it anyway. Well, I'm making due with what I got, but it ain't much. Hopefully, soon, something better will come along. Until then, I'm out. I did two things I didn't really wanna do. I tried to talk to someone that I've had friction with, but that didn't go so well. I may as well give up. I'm tired of feeling like the bad guy when all is said and done. I shouldn't feel that way, but there is no point getting into that. People will just get pissed off and bitch at everyone but me about it. Which is another interesting point. I hear that there are alot of people that have some sort of problem with me or stuff that I say. The only thing I am going to say is this. Quit your whiny ass bitchin' and complainin'. If you've got a problem with something I've said, you talk to me about it or don't open your fucking mouth. Another thing, if people don't like what the fuck I'm saying, then stop reading this damn thing. This isn't for those of you looking to look out for someone unless that someone is ME. So mind your own fucking business. If you wanna read this and have some kind of notion as to what I've been thinking about lately, thats fine. But I swear to GOD if I get one more fucking threat or if I get told what the FUCK to do with my own livejournal one more time, I'm just gonna turn this fucking thing into a GOD DAMN bash session. I'm sure that will piss off my whole fucking hometown, but I don't give a rat's ass. Christ, freedom of speech people. I'm allowed to have a fucking opinion and say my fucking piece. Now that that is over, on to the second thing I wish I hadn't done today. Someone was having a relationship problem. Unfortunately, this was someone I'm friends with and someone I care about. Instead of doing what my heart told me I should do, I did what my brain wanted. My heart wanted me to tell this person that she could do much better and that she should leave him. My heart is selfish. My brain, on the other hand, knew more about the situation. So I did what I could(which wasn't much) to help them figure things out. I hate it when I have that kind of conflict. There is something I want, but yet I pass just to make sure that the other person is happy. You would think that after being burned so many times by that philosophy, I would abandon it. But no, I'm a stand up guy, so I do what I can. I may not agree with what my friends want to do, but I support them regardless. Without my friends, I wouldn't be here. Sometimes I wish I didn't have that thing called a ""conscience"". Sometimes, I just want to tell it to fuck off. What I want to do and say would make me feel so much better, but my stupid conscience won't allow it. Not even in something like this, whether the entry is public or private. I'm and extremely private person, so the only way to make sure I keep my conscience happy is to just ""think"" about what I want to say and do instead of actually doing it. As much as I support people being able to say what they want, I realize that some things just can't be said. Some things complicate things too much. When you've got something good going with someone, you don't say what you really want to say. You don't want to jepordize what you already have, no matter how much you want something else. You just live with. Yes, you will regret it eventually, but some regret is o.k. Just not too much. I can't wait to get back to school. What I really want for Christmas is found there and nowhere else. I guess I'll just have to wait, right? Hopefully it won't be too long. I've spent forever looking, so I guess a year or two more couldn't hurt. Until next time: ""Se conosceste soltanto che cosa ho ritenuto per voi....""

By the way, I know you'll read this. You never called me back about going to Perkins. I would have appreciated a phone call saying you didn't want to or didn't have time tonight. Thanx. Don't expect me to be so pleasant if you aren't willing to return the favor."

"event","I am a very accepting person. I tend to think that I'm very caring, even a little generous sometimes. I'd like to think that I am understanding. Terri calls me the ""All-Knowing Jacko"". Well, I don't know everything, but I do something about a lot of things. I learn more and more everyday, too. I'm not booksmart like the rest of my family. In the commonsense area, though, I'm pretty good. I'm not a genius, just intelligent. I may not have the answer for everything, but I've found that I'm really good at helping other people find it. That being said, I am the dumbest smart person on Earth(Props to Will Smith for that amazing line). I make bad choices. I do things without thinking. I can't see the bigger picture for myself. I can help everyone else with their problems, but I can't seem to figure my own out. For example, Val. I gave that girl almost a year. What am I left with? Nothing. No girl. No friendship. Nothing. I want my fucking year back. It was a waste. After everything we went through, she goes off and gets engaged to Chris not even two months after we split. How fucked up is that? She bitches at me about not having respect for her, but what respect has she shown for me? ""Oh, Jack, you weren't good enough for me, so I'm going to go get engaged to the first dick that comes along."" So now, why do I care? The answer is, I don't. It just goes to show how childish people can be. Oh, and thanx for blaming everything on me. I'm the most terrible person ever and you were only doing what I told you. I'm so commanding. Anyways, on to things that actually matter. I'm working my way towards getting my transmission back. I've saved $200 in tips, which is pretty good for me. Especially since I've only been saving since Friday and I didn't work on Tuesday. I can't wait to have my car back. The freedom that little POS gives me to just get the fuck away from everything is awesome. Sometimes, you just need to escape from reality for a little while. I haven't had that freedom much lately, but when I get my car back, I'll make sure I keep her nice and healthy. And working is fun. I think this summer will be more 35-40 hour weeks so I can have a butt load of money for next year. It will be easier that way. Besides, I don't do much at home except for play D&D and sleep. Those three things are my life now: D&D, work, and sleep. Other than that, I don't do much. Who would have thought? Its cold out and I'm being a lazy bastard. I guess you'll have that. I can't wait to get back to school. So much I want to do. So many things I want to get away from. I like Greenville, I just feel like Clarion is my home now. I kinda feel like I belong there more than I belong here. Oh well, I'm sure you'll have that, too. Anyways, I'm off to watch either a movie, or more episodes of firefly. Until next time, remember: He knows when you are sleeping. He knows when you're awake. He knows when you've been badd or good.....Well, I guess I'm fucked this year!"

I can't wait to get back to college. I'm bored sitting at home, working all the time. I miss my friends, too. I have a few friends up here, and they are great people, but I'd rather be at Clarion and have them come visit. My friends in Clarion kick ass. I think that sometime during my sophmore year or that summer that follows, I'm going to get an apartment. I don't like living on campus, and I don't like coming home. I'd rather just live in Clarion, have people come visit me, and have my own private place, where I can escape if I get tired of the outside world. 

Speaking of being tired, thats how I feel. So I'm cutting this post really short. Good night all. Until next time: Italian women are God's gift to mankind."

"event","Aight, I gotta get back to what this thing was meant to do. I spent so much time defending myself against worthless, stupid, immature people, that I didn't really say anything. Thats why all my posts are hidden. But thats over with. Here is what I think now. First, I don't belong in Greenville, anymore. There is nothing for me here. I have stuff in Clarion. I have a life there. I have friends. I have friends in Greenville, too. But so many of them have changed, that its almost not worth coming back to see them. Its prolly not all them, either. I've changed. But I like who I am. Right now, for the first time in almost a year, I'm happy. Call me heartless, but I don't care. Thats how it is. Phi Sigs are the best people in the world. My sister was one and all her sisters were sweet as hell. The current crop of Phi Sigs are just as awesome. Few of them have taken me in and are watching over me, making sure I don't get into too much trouble. Next semester will be better thanks to them. I have a place to escape to for a little while. Which is awesome. 

I am lonely. Can't hide it, everyone knows. It doesn't bother me really. Its just there. I feel lonely a lot. I could be in a crowded room, and feel all by myself. There are sometimes when I don't feel like that, but a majority of the time I recoginze it. That's life, I guess. 

I hate people who are overly dramatic or think that just because they were once the center of someone's world, they always will be. Sorry, but I don't really care if you're happy. I only care about friends. And thats only a select few friends. Other than that, you're concerns aren't important to me. I admit that at one point I wanted to be the certain of the universe. I got over it. I'm not. I don't like being in the spotlight anymore. Its not for me. I had my time when I was younger, I don't want it now. I guess my point is that I don't want to be around people like that. I want them to leave me alone. I'm sorry if I've hurt anyone, but I'm not going to tell you that. I've been hurt, too. Where's the apology owed to me? Huh? Where is my ""I'm sorry""? Yea, that is what I thought. There isn't one, cuz the same person that bitches at me about other people doesn't realize what they did to me. Oh well, I'm done being nice to people. From now on, unless someone does something for me, I won't do anything for them. 

Now, everyone that reads this wants to know if there is anyone *special* for me. Its been the biggest question I've gotten from anyone, next to ""Are you o.k.?"". So, yea, I have my eye on somebody. Who? I dunno, you'll have to figure that out on your own. will I do anything about it? Prolly not. I'm just not that kind of person anymore. I'm having too much fun being me. If I had the oppurtunity, would I take it? In a fucking heartbeat. But I dunno if I wanna make the first move next time around. The last couple of relationships, I made the first move. I dunno if that is always a good idea for me. Maybe I should let girls do some of the work. Prolly a bad idea for me, but ya know what, I don't care anymore. If I'm not good enough for a girl to come up to me, or initiate anything, then I don't need them. Right? I want someone who wants me. I would treat a woman like that like a freakin' goddess. Its been along time since someone has wanted me. Actually wanted and maybe even needed me. I don't know. I'm a clown to think about stupid shit like that, but ya know what, tough shit. 

Anyway, I'm home and I don't belong here. But I definately don't belong in California right now, either. So as much as some people might hate it, I'll be in Clarion all of next semester, and maybe even the next year. We'll see. I enjoy Clarion right now. There are some sweet people there who actually care about me. So, until next time: its true what they say, home is where the heart is."

At 11:00, she gets online and asks me to come to the Phi Sig house. Yea, so I go over there even though it is FREAKIN' COLD outside. Insanity! Anyway, I'm there from like 11:15 till 8AM!!! Yea, I was there all freakin' night. We made some food, helped Bridgette right a speech, watched movies, studied for Jewelez American Gov't final, and just had a fuckin' blast. That house freakin' rocks. I love spending time with those two. They crack me up and make my day all better. Anyway, I come home around 8 and go to sleep. I didn't wake up till around 3:15. That was awesome. Good sleep even though it was light out. I woke up, did some cleaning and some studying. I was proud of myself today. I got my work done. Yay! Haha, anyway, I've got a final at 10, so I need to get some sleep. Until next time: I am your Squishy, and you shall call me Squishy! Haha, just for Jewelez."

I hung out at the Phi Sig house last night. Definately not what I remember. It was still fun though. Hanging out with Julie and Bridgette until like 2 or 2:30 am was a blast. Those girls are hilarious. Last night was definately what I needed. Definately took my mind off of some shit. I'm definately planning on spending more time at the Phi Sig house next semester now that I am welcome. Not having any finals to worry about today and tomorrow are definately sweet. I have one final on Thursday and then I can go home. Although, right now, I don't want to. Hopefully, I can pick up where I left on when I come back in everything but grades. I've met some pretty sweet people in the last couple of weeks and had some really good times. Nair Hall rocks! Anyway, I'm sure things will be cool when I come back. A lot less to deal with and I'll have my car. The only downside, 6 classes. That bites the big one. Guess I'll just have to suck up and deal, huh? I can do that. It will prolly be easy. I'll have some friends in my classes, so I can get a little bit of help with shit. That will be nice. I don't think I'll be going home every weekend either. I'm going to try and find a job down here. That means, MORE PARTY TIME!!! My main goal next semester is to get all drunkafied and forget at least three or four weekends. Haha, I set such high standards for myself. But you know what, its part of college. Sorry if I'm a disappointment to anyone, but you all know that I'm a big fan of alcoholic beverages. Until next time: If you can't find me, I'm out in search of a still beverage with which to relax."

But I did sit down and play games for like two hours today. It was kind of nice. I just sat down and spent time with friends. It was was a weird feeling. But a good one. it has been a long time since I have actually spent time with friends. Speaking of friends, Megan Baker has been a really good friend as of late. I'm glad things never really went sour with her. Her and Julie have helped me so much the last couple of weeks. I'm really glad they understand what I'm going through. Maybe not understand, but they have been there for me. They like few others. And even though people would blame me, they do not. They are not judgemental. Anyway....some things just do not matter anymore. I'm facing my demons now. I'm conquering them instead of letting them conquer me. Julie and Megan let me know when I falter. They have helped me to understand how to deal with such a tragedy. I can not ever thank them enough. 
On to other news, not that there is much. I'm finally starting to get comfortable in Clarion. Maybe I won't be leaving after all. We'll see. Most of the people here treat me o.k. I'll just have to wait out this semester and next. Then I will decide. I hope things end up better for me. I don't want to seem cocky or brash, but I deserve better. Looking back on my life, I first think that I was an asshole. The more I look at it, the more I realize that I put so much time and effort into things and don't expect anything in return. I've treated people so much better than they have treated me, and I still suffer for it. Never again. I'm older and wiser. I will make better decisions. I will be more careful. I wish that I could tell you all what is wrong, but the time isn't right. I must learn to deal with it before I can learn to share it. Rest assured in knowning that although it is painful, I am not alone. There are a few people who care about me and are helping me. To them I say thank you. Until next time: sticks and stones my break my bones, but memories of this will shatter me like no other."

"event","Sometimes, life throws you a nasty curve ball. This week was such a pitch. I lost a good friend, I dealt with something on my own, and I learned to rely on myself once again. As of right now, Val and I are no longer speaking. Too badd, she's a good person. Even with as angry as I get with her, I can't say badd things. We haven't talked much lately, but I'm going to miss having her on campus to talk to. Its really too badd that she doesn't want to handle this like adults, but you'll have that. In a way, I can't blame her. And in another, I'm furious with her about it. Its just a natural part of life and things go on. I really don't know what to think about it. I can't decide whether I should be friends with her or not if she does change her mind. I'm literally split 50/50. I guess we'll have to see if it ever happens, right? I've learned a few things this week, too. First and foremost, only rely upon yourself. You don't get let down as much. Second, there are people who care. You just have to know where to look for them. Third, Some things just aren't worth it. If people are upset with you, give them time. Life isn't long enough to be mad at some people. Fourth, Julie Hendrickson is the best person alive at Clarion. That girl understands everything and can help with absolutely anything. She's like a counselor, a guide, and an anchor all rolled into one. Since day one, Julie has been helping me with problems that I have. She is so easy to talk to and so understanding. I'm sad she is leaving the dorm, but, as she says, she'll ""just be right down the street."" At least I don't have to go far. Cuz with finals, and next semester, I guarentee I'll be calling her for advice. Its weird. I'm not used to going to someone for advice. I'm used to giving it. I'm not in a position to do that now. Its just different feeling so lost in life. I'm glad I have some really good friends to keep me on track. Oh, I almost forgot. The fifth lesson I learned this week is when I come home for break, I have only two things to do. First, I work. A lot. Second, I play D&D. No one ever wants to hang out at home, so I work all the time. Maybe thats a good thing. We'll find out. I have four days on my upcoming paycheck, but I get paid for 41+ hours. That is definately sweet. What is not sweet is working a 13 hour shift, 8 hour shift, and a 12 hour shift in four days. Than, in the middle, you have the Thanksgiving I had to top it all off. It was crazy. Like, Saturday. I was at work from 11:30am till 5:30 am Sunday morning because I don't do anything but work and play D&D. Hopefully, over X-mas, that will change. I doubt it, though. I'm sorry for anyone that reads this next part, but I have to say it. I'm tired of trusting people. In most cases, it just doesn't work out for me. I'm really trying to, but I have no faith. I've made so many plans and had them broken that I feel like giving up. I've had so many friends turn their backs on me, its not even worth it anymore. I love my friends dearly, but something has to change. Either they quit breaking promises to me and actually do what they say they will, or I stop associating with them. Whether its hanging out or just returning a phone call. I'm sick of it. From now on, no excuses. Someone that lies to me goes directly on the shit list. If they are already there, thats it. A person cannot live their life wondering if their friends are being honest. I don't have time for it. I don't want to sit around all night waiting a call that never comes, or making plans with someone who has no intention of going through with them. I'm an adult. So are most of my friends. They should at least have the balls to call me and say something. I'm not pissed about not talking to anyone or hanging out with anyone. I'm pissed that everyone leaves me hanging, thinking we're gonna do something, when I could try to make plans with someone else if we weren't gonna do anything. I'm getting too old for that bullshit. And I'm too honest with my friends for them to do that to me. Oh well, such is life. Its now 6am, so I'm going to go to bed. The Steelers are on in exactly 7 hours, and I can't miss that. So until next time: Be true to yourself. Live happy and love deeply."

I hear that everywhere. Its true, but why? I mean, some people, like me are impatient. Hehe. But seriously, sometimes you can wait and wait and wait, and they never come. Or sometimes, there is someone else there filling that spot for them. I had a nice, long talk with a female friend of mine tonight. She's moving. Not far away, but still. I don't want her to go. She was my bright spot during the day, and now, she's gone. I'm glad I can still talk to her on a regular basis. Anyway, the conversation was interesting. I'll keep somethings in mind from now on while I'm in Clarion. Anyway, my only night of fun and relaxation is over, and it was good. Didn't do exactly what I wanted to, and didn't see everyone I wanted to see, but its o.k. Hopefully, I'll see them before  I leave. I don't wanna spend too much time on this post because I have to be up at 8:30 or so. So I will try to post tomorrow after work.

"event","Well, Thanksgiving is almost here. What have I got to be thankful for? The few friends that I have who I know actually care. My health, even though I'm sick right now. My job, which will hopefully get me my care back. Other then that, there isn't much. Its just another one of those days where everything closes and you can't do a damn thing. Pisses me off. Oh well, holidays suck, new subject. I was reading everything I could today online in peoples' profiles and in their online journals. Almost everyone is looking forward to seeing someone over break. I'm happy for them, I guess. They've got something good and they are holding on to it. Well done all! You deserve a round of applause. *Pause the applauding to cease* And now, the number one most annoying thing about my life: Whenever I think that something good may happen for me, I find out that there is always someone else. I'm tired of being ""The Friend"" to people. I mean, yea, its nice knowing that people wanna come to you and talk about stuff. But I need more than that. Life is short. Like Metallica says, ""Carpe Diem, Baby"". I want to seize the day. Have fun. Laugh a little. Be with close friends. Instead, I'm stuck in Clarion with one friend who I live with, and another who doesn't really care to talk to me. Always too busy or something. It's alright. I totally understand that everyone on campus, but me, has a life. I just wish that some things were easier to forget. Feelings are the hardest things to forget about and the fastest things to surface when you think. I hate it. Most of the feelings I'm havin' are just old feelings re-emerging. They just won't go away. I know things can't change now, but for some reason, I think that they may. Its bullshit, but its still thought. I'm the person who is most guilty of thinking, ""What if....?"" I think about it all the time. Doesn't matter what, I always ask myself that question. The hardest thing to do is think those things when you know, no matter who you are thinking about, whether its something old or new, is that that particular person does not and will not feel the same way. At least, in my case, that is true. I'm not that lucky. I'm not lucky enough to have someone care about me. I'm not lucky enough to have someone worry about me and love me the way that i worry about and love them. Emotions are cruel and evil things. They toy with your head and destroy your heart. Now that I am alone, I see things more clearly. I don't like it. I liked my judgement being semi-clouded. I liked the feeling that I wasn't and didn't have to be alone. I liked knowing that no matter what I was doing, there was someone out there who was thinking about me while I was thinking about them. I miss phone conversations that lasted all night and falling asleep on the phone with the person you were dreaming about. I miss group activities where you know that your other was looking at you, even though you may not be paying attention. And the times alone, where you could just sit, hold them, and stare at the stars. I miss car rides where we could talk. I miss all the moments that were romantic in an odd sort of way. I miss having someone's eyes to gaze into and get lost in. Most of all, I miss the hand to hold on to, no matter where we were or what was going on around us. I'm not pointing anyone out in particular, just observations of the things I miss about relationships. But, as with everything else, I must realize that it comes to an end. You have to pick up and move on. Dwelling on the past is no an option. My only salvation can be looking towards the future. Until next time: Absense is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, and it enkindles the great. Good night."

"event","Aight, so I went to those plays tonight. They were definately freaky. Its a good thing I like plays, or I wouldn't have understood them one bit. I have to write a critique on them, which blows major balls, but I'll survive. I get to go home this weekend. Go me! I just hope that I am able to do something with people. I get bored sitting at home at 11pm, when at college I never go to bed until 1 or 2 in the morning. I don't really care who I hang out with, as long as I get to hang out with someone. I get so bored on the weekends. Its terrible. I really hope that next semester I find a good job in Clarion that I can actually deal with. I hate running home every weekend for money. I'm so glad that Thanksgiving break is coming. I can't stand college right now. Too much to do. Its just getting to me. I've been playing Halo 2 WAY TOO MUCH lately. I guess it is because I have nothing better to do. Oh well. Its fun. I haven't talked to Val in a while either. Its kinda different. She's made some friends up here now, so she doesn't need me anymore, I guess. I knew it would happen eventually, just didn't know when. Which leads me to my next point, if I even have one. Adjusting to life is hard. Its like being at bat in a baseball game, and ""Life"" is the pitcher. Every 30 seconds is different. Sometimes, its a fastball. Then, out of the blue, you get a knuckleball or curve. Then, back to the fastball. And he'll usually finish you off with a change-up. It takes a lot of concentration, disipline, and patience to adjust to different things in life. None of which I have right now. It seems like all at once, the whole world stopped caring about me. I know this isn't really the case, but seriously, there was a point when Val was my world. She doesn't need me now. Tiffany, too. Same thing happened with her. I try to maintain friendships, but it doesn't work. At first, I thought, ""There is definately something wrong with them. I'm nice guy. They just aren't trying."" Now I know its not anything that is wrong with them. Its something wrong with me. There is something that I'm not doing right. And I don't know what it is. Its more than just those two, but at 2 o'clock in the morning, they are the only two I can think of. I've noticed that in every one of my posts, or almost everyone of them, I talk about being alone. Its weird. I'm not really alone, but I feel like I am. Like right now, I could be hanging out with Spew, Uhl, and JayDee. But I'm not. I'm sitting here, writing this. There are lots of times like that. The guys in my hall are cool. Well, most of them. Not many of them invite me to go do stuff, but some of them do. Its more than I can say for my roommate. I can't remember the last time he went to do something and asked me to go with him. Its always me asking him if he wants to go. Am I not good enough to go hang out with? Whatever. I'm not concerned about it anymore. If I'm still going to Clarion my sophmore year, I'm moving into Reinhardt Villages. Then I won't have to worry about a roommate and not being included in things. Maybe out there, I could shut myself off from the world and get things done. We'll see. That is still really far off yet. No promises to anyone about anything for then. If I'm here, I'm here. If I'm not, not many will miss me. Its a win-win situation for me, really. If I move to Cali, then I'm away from PA, and I can be me for the first time in a long time. If I get a place at the Village, then I don't have to share things with anyone. I can be secluded and be happy. Anyway, I have class at 9am, so I'm going to hit the hay. Especially since by the time I am done writing all this, it will be 2:15am. Hope everyone is enjoying this, for better or worse. Let me know what you think by messaging me on AIM or ICQ or by posting a message on here. Holla at ya'll late. Until then: Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."

"event","Wow, I've been a bad boy. Its been forever since I've written in here. Well, not forever, but it sure as hell seems like it. Anyway, I'll update you as much as I can about what I've been doing. First of all, Halo 2 is badass. As of right now, I own it, which means if I get an X-Box for Christmas, it's all mine bitches. Hahahahaha. Anyway, I beat it already, with the help of my good friend John Marango. I hated the ending. Such bullshit. Where is Halo 3? Oh yea, I get to go to a play tonight for theater. Yippe skippy. I'm so excited. NOT! I'm missing Suessical this weekend to go to this thing. Unfortunately for me, going is required because I have to write a crtique. Speaking of class, college sucks major balls. I hate it, I think. I mean, some parts are cool. But like I've complained before, I just don't think I was ready to be here. I should have waited. Maybe not always the best option, but I think it may have been the right one for me. I guess we'll just have to find out. I don't think my sister will be buying my books next semester because I suck at my classes. Oh well, shit happens. Gotta learn to completely take care of myself sometime, right? I guess we'll see how that goes. Did I mention that I think I'm going to move to California? No, not the one in PA. The state. The awesome state that is run by Arnold(I'll be back). Yea, I'm thinking about looking at some colleges out there. I need to get away. Seriously, I can't stand PA anymore. There is just too much menial shit that I can't take. Most of it could be avoided simply by moving. Now, I know that its not good to run from your problems, but I don't really care. I guarentee, my problems won't catch up with me out there. Especially if no one knows where I'm going to school at. I think that sounds like a good plan. I know that some people, including my family won't like it. But then again, this is my life. And I will live however the hell I feel like. So begins the search. Today, after class but before I go to the play, I will spend my time looking at going to California somewhere. I may decide that it is not the best move for me. And then again, I may decide that it will definately kick some major ass. I've always wanted to go out there anyway, so maybe I'll go visit one or two of those colleges over the summer. The mere thought of going out there, with no one that I know from high school around me, and without having people know exactly where I'm at is exciting. Exhilerating, even. When I came home, no one would know. When I leave, they won't know where I am going. If they want to talk to me, they'll have to figure out how to get ahold of me all on their own. That could be fun. Find out who my real friends are. We'll see though. I'm sure that I'll be stuck in good o'le Clarion for the next four years. But its fun to dream. Maybe I'll have a talk with my sister about this one. All this talk of moving has got me thinking. I don't think its such a bad idea. I'm gonna call Greenville, too, and find out if anyone from our high school went out there. I hope not. I don't want to be around people from high school. Its time to start over. Time to make a new life for myself. I know that I sound like a mean, hateful bastard. But I'm not. I love all my friends. I just think that in order for me to do things right for myself, I've got to get away from things I'm used to and comfortable around. Anyway, its just a dream. Most likely, a dream that won't happen for me anyway. And then there is my social life. Haha, non-exsistant. I mean, I do hang out with some people, but thats only occasionally. And there are only a few I stand to be around for any length of time. Then, there are those who I try to hang out with, but can never find time to hang out with me. Maybe I should take the hint? If there is one, anyway. In posts that none of you can see now, but that some of you have read, I wished I was a kid again. Well, I take it back. There is no sense wishing for something you can't have. Those were good times. And I was happy. But I'm different. Not changed really, just different. Emotions affect me differently now. The people in my life have changed me. They didn't change me for the better, they just changed me. And not all of it was them. Some of it was me. Anyway, I need to find new ways to make me happy. Takes a lot of work to do something like that, but I'm sure I'll find some time to try. The worst part about life right now is the feeling that everything I'm doing, I'm doing alone. I miss the times when I had someone to turn to to take my mind off of things. Someone to spend time with when I wanted to tell the rest of the world to fuck off. Someone I could call and talk to, and be happy just because we were talking. Those times are gone, though. 

Wow, how about me getting side tracked. I'm such a goon sometimes. Anyways, Thanksgiving break starts Tuesday night after class. I'm thinking about going home Monday night, though. Tuesday can be a day of rest and relaxation for me. Yea, right. But a guy dream, can't he? If I did that, I'd prolly end up doing work for my dad. Maybe I'll stay at someone else's house that night, just so I don't have to. No, that would make me a terrible son. Anyways, I'll prolly a little something later for you to read. But as for right now, I need to shave, BADLY!!!! So, I'm gonna bounce. Leave me comments, I like them. Until next time, remember this: No matter what stipper tells you, there is NO SEX in the champainge room!"

"event","""Hi everybody!"" ""Hi Dr. Nick!"" No, don't get your hopes up. I can't recite entire episodes of The Simpsons or I would be totally sweet and everyone would love me. Some of you that are reading this now are wondering, ""Jack, what happened to all your other posts that you had before this one?"" Well, thats a very good question. Let me tell you a little story. You see, I realized this weekend that I was being a complete fool. I've been trying to rediscover who I used to be, because I'm not very happy with who I am. In the process, A LOT of memories came flooding back into my head. A lot of good ones and a lot of badd ones. I'm not even going to waste time sorting out which were which. It doesn't matter. And don't bother trying to figure it out, either. You'd be wasting your time because no one knows me right now. Anyway, instead of putting in here what I may or may not have felt, I've decided to just do a re-cap of the day and maybe a small psychoanalysis. We'll see how all of this goes. This LiveJournal may turn into something more, but who knows? I certainly don't. So, for starters, the Pittsburgh Steelers kick ASS!!!! I've been a big fan of Bliztburgh since I was but a wee-little boy. My grandma is the one to thank for that. That woman was a genius. Anyway, I was stoked today that Pittsburgh beat Cleveland. Not as big a rivalry as it used to be, but still pretty damn big. They are definately the number 1 team in the NFL. Can't call this a fluke baby. Beat the only two unbeaten teams, then went to their arch-rival's house and stomped on them. They went to the Dawg-House, stole the Dawgs' bone, and then beat them with it. I love the Stillers!!!!! I saw Cynthia Frazier Saturday night. I haven't seen her in a grip. That girl looks amazing, as usual. She has a sweet car, too. Makes me jealous. She's got good looks, definately got the brains, a sweet car, and she doesn't mind teasing me. What more could you ask for? Maybe a date when she comes home? Doubtful. But, this is America, and I am free to dream. I didn't post over the weekend because I wasn't in the best mood. For everyone that knows me, that is nothing new. I'm working on it, though. I really am. The first step will be getting over this cold. The second step will be to find something that makes me happy. First one is easy, the second isn't. Such is life. Good things come to those who wait. I saw a few people over the weekend, so that was kinda cool. Wish that I would have hung out with more people, though. I was definately bored most of the weekend. Grrr. At least I have work to keep me company. Hehe, and my boss loves me, which is why I still have a job. So all is well in that respect. Anyway, I took some Nyquil to fight this cold, so I'm about ready to zonk out. I'll catch you all on the flip side. Always remember: Be You, do what you do. Nothing is better, Dr. Pepper!"

"event","OK, so maybe I was wrong about Hall Wars. I thought it was supposed to be fun. We get out there and we have one too many kids. I signed everyone up or else they wouldn't be out there. I've been looking forward to this all week. And all I can hear is Little Ryan bitching about me playing. I'm pretty sure that Joe didn't want me to play either. SO what did I do, I said 'Fuck it!' If they don't want me to play, then I won't play. If they lose, I don't wanna be sittin' here listenin' to them bitch because ""I"" blew the game. Most likely, one of the would have blown the game and they just would hvae blamed it on me. Either way, I don't want to have to deal with it. Not in the state I'm in. I'm sick, slightly injured and very, very unsure of myself about somethings. The last thing I want is for a couple of assholes to be bitchin' about me. Whether I'm blowin' this all out of proportion or not, I don't care. This is my space to bitch and 'put my thoughts on paper'. So thats exactly what I'm doing. I emailed Tiffany today. That kinda made me happy. At least I can think that she got it. I think I'm looking to much into this, though. As much as I want there to be, I don't think there will ever be anything between us. I hope that I am wrong, but experience says otherwise. I wish I had a crystal ball that could look into the future so I could see what will happen between us, if anything. Just to know. Just so that I could relax about it. If I knew we were going to be together, then I could sit back, relax and think 'Hey, it IS going to happen someday.' But I don't know that, and I sure as hell can't predict it. And that is what I don't like about life. Not being able to predict things. I mean, sometimes its cool. But when its something like this, and its tearing me apart, I just want to know. I can't relax unless I know for sure. The whole date thing I talked about earlier seemed like a real possibility. Something that might actually work. It woudl be something that would show her that I was for real and that I was going to be there all the time this time. That I could be there anytime she needed me. All she would have to do is pick up the phone and I would come running. I was trying to talk to JP about it earlier and he tried to compare it to him participating in the tug-of-war competition that we are having on Saturday. There is the mark of a kid who has never been in a relationship, let alone found someone he cared so much about. Well, what can you expect? He wasn't around to see us together, so he definately wouldn't have a clue as to how I'm feeling. That gets me thinking. I wonder how many people actually do know how I'm feeling? I mean, people say they know, but do they really? Could anyone possibly understand what goes through my head when I talk to her? Could the imagine the speed my heart races when I see her? Could the comprehend the emotions that flourish in me from just being around her? Does Tiffany understand any of this? Does she or did she ever feel the same? How do you explain something like this to someone? I thought about letting her read this. She doesn't have the URL yet, so I could always keep it from her. But that would mean that I might not ever get the chance to say how I truly feel. And if she does read this, she may feel differently. She may seclude herself from me for even longer. Would she be upset? Understanding? Accepting? Would she return my feelings? Just too many 'IF's and I'm not sure what to do. Well, I'm thinking about going and getting some dinner because I hear that meal is important. Maybe I'll write again after I get back from my sister's tonight. That will be a nice reliever from this hecktic(sp?) campus life. Until next time: Toga! Toga! Toga!"

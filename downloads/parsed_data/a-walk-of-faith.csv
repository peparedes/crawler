"event","Well, it's been quite a while since I last updated. I was reading some friends' journals and decided to join the party. I don't really have much to say. My summer is going ok. I hate working. My Lookouts' boss quit, and my UTC boss is a douche bag. Not to mention, I don't get nearly enough hours. Pisses me off. Also, people in Media Resources get paid $6.25/hour, while I get paid $6/hour to do ten times as much work. Is that fair? Fuck No.

Anyway, I went on a vacation with Jim and Clayton to Minnesota. It was ok. Went to a Twins' game which made me happy. I think that saved the vacation for me. I enjoyed not being home, but my options in Minnesota were A) sit on my ass B) sit on my ass C) play golf -OR- D) sit on my ass. Sound fun?

Well, I have to be at work at 9am for Freshman Orientation. Fuck."

"event","Well, it's been quite a while since I updated. I get to thinking about why I haven't. Is it because I'm lazy? Partially. Because I really don't have time? Could be. Or is it because I have life outside of the internet? Most definitely.

Nothing really big has happened to me in quite some time.

I bought an iPod Shuffle today. It was somewhere around $120 with tax and a 2-year warranty. Not too shabby if you ask me.

I've also been thinking about trying to get a job at which I will earn more than $6/hour. Key statement in that sentence is ""I've been thing about trying to..."" which proves that I truly am lazy.

I'm pretty excited about tomorrow. I'm going to see the Braves take on the Phillies in a 1:20 afternoon game. It will be major fun. I'm going with my Dad, Uncle, Cousin, 2ND Cousin (My Mom's Cousin), My Uncle's Dad, and one of my Uncle's friends. We leave in the morning around 10ish. I think I may hit up the YMCA before I meet them to leave.

Ok. Now it's time for bed. Night All."

"event","I'm not sure how long this entry will be, but I felt like doing it.

I've realized, no matter how cool I thought I was then, that there is a big difference between high schoolers and college folk. Maybe it's a maturity level thing, I don't know. Friend-wise, I am enjoying college a lot more. School-wise, I'd rather be in high school... classes are easier and are mandatory (which might not sound like a good thing, but it gives you a reason to be there rather than skip it and fail).

Another thing, for those of you high schoolers reading this (with the exception of a few), don't tie yourself up in a relationship. You and your ""other"" will go to separate colleges and will not be able to keep it together.

Right now, I am in a relationship and am very happy with it. :-D

That's all for now.

Bleh.

Final note: Prom is overrated."

"event","Well... it's been a long damn time since I last updated.

Here's a recap of what has happened since I last wrote in here:

-Friday, April 15 - Christian had a party at his dorm. There were a shit-ton of people drinking and partying and doing crazy shit. RA's and cops come, everyone scatters. The only alcohol that survived was my bottle of Absolut that I put in a random drawer near the stove. I had a few drinks at Christian's, but it didn't hit me until I got back to Annie's. That was bad. I licked a wall, gave a pep talk to a fish (Why? I don't know), and did plenty of stupid shit.

-Last week - UTC started their finals. All of mine that I took fucked me in the ass. Oh, man... they all SUCKED! I definitely won't get initiated this semester.

-Friday, April 22 - Annie and I went to Knoxville to visit Clayton and because she had something to do for her sorority. We partied a little Friday. It was crazy. Some guy managed to get a keg in the dorm. That got busted up by RA's as well. Clayton ran from an RA too. I had to take care of Annie. It wasn't so bad.

-GOOD NEWS - Housing here at UTC is all fucked up so some people didn't get a room, but I was one of the lucky people that did. I'll be in Boling #211. It's going to be fun.

That's it.

"event","Today was a long and eventful day. I woke up at 6:30 to get ready to run the 65 Roses 5K. As soon as I woke up, I could feel my throat hurting, so I decided not to run. It was $17 to enter, but I figured it went towards a good cause... some charity for cystic fibrosis. I say it's a good charity, because one of my friends died last year after a life-long battle with cystic fibrosis.

Around 10:30, I went to Lee's house for a Bloody Mary Breakfast. It was a lot of fun. I got to see a lot of alumni. And I got some pretty cool shirts to boot. From there, I went to T-Bones where we had a day party. It was so much fun. I ate 8 goldfish there. I couldn't taste them so it wasn't so bad. The first seven were easy, but the last one almost made me gag because I took it straight without water. I actually kept one of them, and went to Walmart and bought some stuff to take care of him. I can't think of a name for him.

As I was leaving Walmart, my Dad called me with an idea for tonight. His idea was to go to the Cleveland Speedway. So, I accepted his offer. It was a lot of fun. There were a TON of rednecks too.

Dammit... my throat still hurts. ARGH!"

"event","So... yeah, life is pretty stressful at this moment in time. My pledge period is almost over. I think I'm going to try to stick it out. Finals are within a matter of weeks. And I am so unprepared it's not even funny. And some other shit that I'm not going to even touch with a ten-foot stick. For those of you reading this, the shit that I'm not going to touch on isn't what you may think it is.

On a lighter note, I have a meeting tomorrow afternoon with the people from the Lookouts. It looks as if I'm going to be a ticket take this season. It's not my preferred choice of where to work, but as long as I get to work at the ballpark I will be ok. BellSouth Park is my second home during the summer.

And on an even lighter note, IT'S BASEBALL SEASON! I am so excited. I'm doing a fantasy baseball league on Yahoo. My team name is Phi Delt Fury. They're awesome. The draft was last Friday at 10, but, of course, I missed it. I did wind up with some fairly decent players. Like Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, and Tony Womack. A-Rod is the #1 player in the league. I don't like him normally, but he's definitely a benefit to my team. I won my first matchup, 4-0. I think we can take it all. I hope so atleast.

I'm gone."

"event","I'm really starting to get frustrated with this whole fraternity bullshit. They're always asking me to do favors for them, and run errands... and it's starting to really piss me off, especially, when you don't do something just right and they decide to be a fucking asshole about it. A lot of people wouldn't put themselves through what I put myself through. I don't know how much longer this is going to last. 

Anyway, our philanthropy week is this week. It's called Grand Slam Week. Also, we're having a 3-day party this weekend called April Madness. I can't wait for that. I get to work a lot this week too. I don't have an off day for the next 2 weeks or so.

I'm gone."

"event","I had a pretty good birthday... could've been better, but it could've been a lot worse. My worst birthday experience was on my 16th birthday. Instead of celebrating and doing the teenager thing, I went to a funeral. It blew. I only went for support of the rest of the family. I woke up as usual, went to work, went to class, and back to work. I got to see my lovely Annie today. It was so great. I get to see her perform tomorrow night. I'm feeling the L-bomb getting ready to drop, but I won't let it. I do not want to get in the habit of saying that. Maybe a few months or so down the road, but not now. I already told her about my feelings, but I don't want to tarnish the significance of those three little (but VERY big) words. Anyway, back to my story. I went out to eat with the fam at Outback... that was the third time in a row that I've celebrated my birthday at Outback. It was great. I GOT CRABS! Alaskan King Crab to be exact. Get your mind out of the gutter. After dinner, I was Drive-a-Phi. That was ok. I made $4... WOOHOO! I started around 9:30 and didn't finish until 3:15. That's less than a dollar an hour. Well, I'm going to bed, because I am only probably going to get three hours of sleep because I have to get up at the asscrack of dawn for a roadrace. It's going to suck, trust me, I know it will. Goodnight all. Much love to everyone!

On Thursday, the 31st, which is my Dad's 50th birthday, I am going out to eat with him and some other people. It will be fun. After that, I'm thinking about going to Voodoo to dance the night away. However, I'm beginning to have second thoughts about it. It seems like everyone either has no money or just doesn't want to go. I don't ask for much. I just wish some people would realize how important my birthday is to me. I don't even want presents, I just want to be able to hang out with my friends. It better not rain on Friday... if it does I think I may cry.

"event","If you could be granted one wish, what would it be? I would wish that everyone could stop worrying about little things and just be happy with everything around them. There are too many people out there that clutter their lives with petty bullshit.

If you could spend one night alone with anyone, who would it be? The answer should be pretty obvious on this one, but for those of you that don't know, I would want to spend the night with Annie... not that I don't do that already, but tonight is one of those few nights where I will be sleeping in my bed because she's in Nashville doing what she loves... color guard.

If you could permanently alter one thing about your physical appearance, what would it be? I would want to be tan.

If you could posess one supernatural ability, what would it be? To be able to read minds.

If your mate could do one thing to ensure that they would love you forever, what would it be? I don't know.

If you could live anywhere in the world, all expenses paid, for one year, where would you live? Somewhere where it is warm. On the beach. Probably somewhere along the Gulf in South Florida. I would like a house on the beach with a bar on the back porch, some tiki torches, palm trees, and a hammock... also Annie would have to be with me. I wouldn't want to be there without her.

If you could ensure that your children would never have one experience you've had, which would it be? If I ever have kids, which someday I will, I will be sure to name them something to where they can't be made fun of. I grew up listening to Mike Hunt jokes... funny the first time, and really damn annoying each time after that. I don't mind it so much now, just as long as you're not a dick about it.

If you could ""unknow"" one thing, what would it be? I would erase the Clayton-Lauren visuals out of my head, as well as what I know.

If you could ask God one question, what would it be? What is your plan for me?

If you could take away the vocal cords of any person you know, who would it be? My ex-girlfriend Jamie... she's pretty cool, but her voice gets on my nerves sometimes. 

If you could have a movie romance with any fictional character, who would you choose? I don't know.

If you could kiss someone you never have, who would it be? I don't want to kiss anyone other than Annie. I know this sounds like I have to say this, but, really, I am completely happy with her and would not want to be with anyone else."

Keep her coming every night.
So hard to keep her satisfied.
Kept playing love like it was just a game,
Pretending to feel the same,
Then turn around and leave again.""

Repair your broken wings,

Spring Break has officially started, but not for me however. I have work in the morning at 9. I'm going in an hour early so I can see the wrecking ball tear down North Stadium. It will be marvelous. I cannot wait for Monday. Annie and I are planning on leaving at 7am. I will probably spend the night at her dorm on Sunday, like always. I seriously cannot wait until we get to Florida. I love Florida. It's one of my favorite states... even though I've only been to it once. I went to Jacksonville two summers ago. It was awesome. Fort Walton Beach is in North Florida on the Gulf Coast. I hear that it's supposed to be around 70 degrees when we're staying there. I hope it gets warm enough to swim. Even if I don't swim, I will still enjoy myself. I love being around Annie. She is awesome. I can be myself around her. I don't have to hide anything like I did from Lauren. There's still a bunch of stuff that I did that she doesn't know about. But, no, I didn't cheat on her. As big of an asshole that I may be, I will never cheat on my girlfriend, wife, whatever. I'm not that kind of guy, and I never will be. I think I'm going to lay down and wait for someone to call me. Hopefully since it's Spring Break, everyone has gone home, or is away in Florida, or Mexico, or a Spring Break hotspot. As long as they're not here to call me and ask for a ride, I will be alright.

Peace Up... A-Town Down!"

"event","Man, I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off. -Tyler Durden

The first rule of Fight Club is - you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is - you DO NOT talk about Fight Club. Third rule of Fight Club, someone yells ""Stop!"", goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. Fourth rule, only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule, one fight at a time, fellas. Sixth rule, no shirt, no shoes. Seventh rule, fights will go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule, if this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight. -Tyler Durden

A condom is the glass slipper for our generation. You slip one on when you meet a stranger. You ""dance"" all night, and then you throw it away. The condom, I mean, not the stranger. -Marla Singer (from Fight Club)

Walk blindly to the light. Reach for his hand. Don't ask any questions, and don't try to understand. Open your mind, and, then, open your heart. You will see that you and me are very far apart. -Blessed Union of Souls

Life is one big road with lots of signs. So when you riding through the ruts, don't complicate your mind. Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy. Don't bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality . Wake Up and Live! -Bob Marley"

I was one of the two Phikeia's who were on duty for Drive-a-Phi, which is like a taxi service for some of the brothers who drink too much and don't want to drive. I only gave rides to 4 brothers, and 1 pledge. I made $3.06... WOO WOO! It was a lot of fun though. I never imagined going through a McDonald's drive-thru could be so entertaining. It was great.

Today I'm going to Nashville to work one of Annie's competitions. I'm nervous about working it, because I have never done it before. I hope I get to sell tickets or something easy, like concessions. I can't wait to see her. I only got to see her for about 5 minutes yesterday, and that was nowhere near enough. Gah.

I got to go collect some dues from some of the pledges. I'll tell everyone about the rest of my weekend later. Probably Monday."

"event","This past weekend was quite a doozy. It involved a lot of alcohol, a lot of driving, and a lot of rain. Luckily, they didn't occur all at once. It all began Friday night. I had to work from 5 to 6, which wasn't bad. After that, I crashed at my dorm for a while... I talked online, played the guitar, and napped as well. Around 9:30, Christian calls me saying he's at the Rave and wanted to know if I wanted to see Constantine with him and some of his friends. Since I had nothing to do, I went. Good movie. After the movie, I went back to my dorm so I could go to bed since I had to be at work at 8:00 the next morning. Right as I'm about to hop into bed, Josh calls me saying there's a party at the Leeroy's house. I went, not expecting to stay long since there was mostly just beer. As I get there, someone introduces me to the wonderful concoction of Kryptonite, which is cognac and Hpnotiq mixed. The taste of it was quite revolting, but there wasn't too much of an aftertaste. So, I drank the last half of the bottle. And I was GONE! I don't remember much, except for falling down one flight of stairs, and then doing a headfirst slide down the other, after which I hit my chin on the marble floor. That sucked. Well, it didn't at the time because I couldn't feel it, but there's a big knot there now. Somehow I made it to the kitchen where I passed out on the couch. All I've got to say about that is ""Thank God for ADPi girls."" They saved my life. They made sure I passed out with my shoes off, and when I woke up, I had a nice big comforter on me. However, I was hungover like a bitch, and was an hour and a half late to work. I made it to work and did my job and no one said anything about it. The first half of Saturday sucked real bad since I was hungover. I felt like I was going to vomit at any given moment.

I left for Nashville to see Annie's competition around 6ish. I made it to Independence High School with ease. The directions were on the money. I saw a few units do their thing before Chimeras went on. Apparently they changed a lot of their show. I noticed. It was good. There were a few drops here and there, but nothing really bad. I enjoyed it. Also, they got a score of 76, which was higher than everyone else there, I think. After the show, they held a clinic for high schoolers. That lasted an hour or so. From there, we went to Wendy's to get some latenight food. After we ate, we went our separate ways.

I went to my aunt's house and she went home. My aunt gave me good directions to her house, and she helped me through it all over the phone. Once I got there, I went straight to bed, because I was exhausted. 

Sunday morning was nice. I got to sleep in. That felt good. We went to Jersey Mike's. I saw a kid named Hunter from church camp there. That was kinda cool. We ate and went back to my aunt's house. I printed off directions to Mount Juliet Middle School and was on my way. I got there alright, except Mapquest sent me in the wrong direction on Mount Juliet Road. It wasn't so bad. I stopped being a guy for a second and stopped to ask for directions. I made it right as Annie's practice was over.

We stopped at a gas station to get some snacks for the road, and then we drove back to Chattanooga. It took forever. Also, it rained a good portion of the time. I hate rain. I thought I was going to hydroplane. But I didn't. I made it safely back to Chattanooga and all was well.

I get to do it all again next weekend, too. Except without the drinking and hangover. WAHOO!"

"event","Yesterday was quite possibly one of the ""longest"" days I've had in a while. I woke up at 6:30 in order to be at work at 7. That blew. We didn't even have to be there until 8. After that I went back to my dorm to catch up on some z's. Intro to EHLS was crap. I hate that class. Dr. Stern talks about all this bullshit that we have to know. Instead of Intro to EHLS, the class should be Philosophy and Computer Science, or something to that effect. The class is all about Dr. Fanning and what he likes. Once class was over, I had an hour break before I had to be back at work. We didn't do much because my boss meant for us to work from 2 until 4 today. I got off at 3. Kara, Annie, and I went to Hamilton Place for a while. That was fun. After that, Annie dropped me off at the McKenzie Arena because I volunteered to work the TSSAA State wrestling tournament. I worked concessions for 3.5 hours. At first I was confused and didn't know what to do, but I got the hang of it. They let me off around 8:45. Once I left there, I went to visit my favorite old lady... Mrs. Mary. I got some drinks for the night from her and headed to Annie's dorm to pick up some of my clothes. Before we went to Voodoo, I had 3 drinks and I FELT GOOD! However, after dancing for about 20 minutes, the buzz wore off. That was ok though. I was having the time of my life, not to mention, everyone around me probably wouldn't remember me in the morning. We stayed until about 2am. Then we went back to Annie's dorm. She took a shower, and I basically climbed into bed and passed out because I was so exhausted.

Annie's so amazing. I don't know what I'd do without her. Another thing, I can't wait to go back to Voodoo."

I'll tell you why, because paper can't beat anybody. A rock would tear that shit up in 2 seconds. When I play rock, paper, scissors I always choose rock. Then when somebody claims to have beaten me with their paper I can punch them in the face with my already clenched fist and say, ""Oh, shit! I'm sorry. I thought paper would protect you."""

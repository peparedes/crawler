Hachibaba, it has been a WHILE! I went through a bad breakup online, met my true love offline, turned twenty, made Dean's List at school four semesters in a row, wrote a lot, drew, got addicted to the Internet, got tendinitis, made new friends, talked to people, worked at McDonald's, joined a new a cappella group, learned about lacrosse, and finally saw Die Hard. I even reconciled with the stupid and embarrassing parts of my childhood, for the most part.

Anyways. Chief reason I came back is for the sake of writing. I will be on here seeing various groups. I don't intend to spend a ton of time on here, due to the aforementioned Net addiction and my ongoing battle with it. But I am back.

Later, nobody!"

"event","WHOA. 'S been a while. I got stuff done, got a Live Messenger profile, became addicted to Repo the Genetic Opera, developed my love for anime ever more, and spilled milk on my laptop. (sniffle) But besides that. Cole and I recently discovered that peanut butter was not, in fact, invented by George Washington Carver - or at least, the peanut butter we know and love today was not. People had come up with similar ideas before. With the cotton crops dying everywhere, Carver's research in finding previously developed ideas and suporting his own ideas for crops like peanuts, soybeans, and sweet potatoes, were a godsend. But enough of that. Here's some inventors I believe deserve credit.

PHILLIP E. MEYERS and ROMMY REVSON: Inventor and patentor of the scrunchie
JENNINGS COX: Inventor of the daiquiri
MARY ANDERSON: Invented the first windshield wipers

BRIAN WALKER: Invented the air-zooka

"event","So life is going pretty great right now. I have a BF who is just as nerdy as me, I made Dean's List, I'm trapped at home with a bad cold but at least I don't have the flu like half the kids on my floor at school. And I just had a major revelation. I was watching bloopers from Season 2 of House, and as I looked at Jesse Spencer, it occurred to me - as it usually does - that he's utterly gorgeous. The thing is, the actor I really have a crush on is Hugh Laurie. And so do most of the girls I know who watch the show (Lauren says it's one thing she and her mom agree on). Why did we ignore the obvious choice of Jesse, the hot blond Aussie dreamboat, and go for Hugh, the stubbly British blue-eyed snarker?

I think it's because Jesse is so beautiful, everyone ignores him and goes to look for beauty in the unlikely places (Robert Sean Leonard's nice-guy 'tude, Hugh Laurie's dreamy eyes, etc.). There are characters in comics, books, movies and TV shows who are so gorgeous and such obvious fangirl bait that we take their beauty for granted and get a crush on someone else. We still have a crush on the gorgeous one, of course, but everyone does, so there's no reason to fight. People fight over their character crushes because they have the feeling they were the first to notice how amazingly hot he was. If everyone knew from the start that a character was gorgeous, there's no reason to fight. We all just share the love. But as everyone knows, peace is boring. So we go find characters to fight over. Whether this same theory applies to fanboys is still unknown. They tend to fight even if everyone knows the character is hot.

Of course, there will be some fangirls who fight over characters regardless of this standard. But these tend to be young, inexperienced fangirls who will mature later and start to follow the rule without even realizing it.

There's other characters like this, too, besides Chase (Jesse). These are all just based on my personal experience when watching fangirl-fights:

Peter Petrelli (Heroes)
Mohinder Suresh (Heroes)
Yuki Sohma (Fruits Basket)
Light Yagami (Death Note)
Will Turner (Pirates of the Caribbean)
Tamaki Suoh (Ouran High School Host Club)"

So I'm on a self-enforced hiatus from the forum (I'll read it in my spare time, but I won't post for another 34 days, and then I'll be on sporadically at best until Christmas break). I've been getting slight pain in my wrists for the last week or two, and I'm beginning to worry that I might have carpal tunnel syndrome, however mild. I say it's the manufacturer's fault for making people have to pay extra for those cushions on the keyboards. But on to today's real issue.

This is a message to all Hollywood executives, and a few people on MTV. MAKE ORIGINAL MOVIES. NO-ONE WANTS A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET REMAKE. THE SAME GOES FOR ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. THE ORIGINAL MOVIES MAY SUCK, BUT AT LEAST YOU'LL GET CREDIT FOR TRYING. SO QUIT STEALING OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS AND REUSING THEM, OR I'M HAVING YOU ARRESTED FOR CRIMES AGAINST POP CULTURE AND QUITE POSSIBLY HUMANITY.

"event","So I'm at college now. And everything is pretty much hunky-dory. Jill lives on the floor above me, my roommate is a cool person majoring in Criminal Justice, and the people in my dorm are all really nice. There's also a great bookstore, a market right nearby, and I missed a mandatory meeting without getting in any trouble for it. I just have one little problem.

I'm an undecided major.

I wanted to be in the Hartt School of Music - I love singing, and musical theater is a passion of mine. But the school is just too damn demanding. I asked if I could, say, major in English and minor in Vocal Performance. They said no. It's too hard to switch between the colleges. If you want to be in the Hartt School, you have to sell your soul to music and music alone. And I'm not sure I want to do that yet. I have a lot of interests - and I want to exploit them all, in that selfish little Honors-kid way. I love music, sure, but I also love to write, act, play piano and guitar, learn about mythology - I could go on for hours. And I don't like feeling guilty or inadequate whenever some music kid posts on a Facebook group that those who can't handle the Hartt School are ""pussies"", or seeing a kid with a much busier week than mine because they need to take all those extra classes for their major. In my opinion, I'm just one of the few students who's being truly honest about entering college. Half of the kids here, probably more, are going to change their majors at least five times before they graduate. I'm just leaving out one step by taking time to see what I really want to do. 

So listen up, Hartt kids. I know some of you have asked me whether I major in music when you saw my guitar or heard me singing in the hall. And I know I told you the truth - that I'm a blind woman feeling her way through Braille manuscripts of my possible life. But how many of you are sacrificing your other interests for the sake of your major? An English major may be generic, but there are possibilities to get involved in music without majoring in it.

To all my homies without a major - don't let the others get you down. Be happy; you are being more honest about yourself than they are."

About a month or so ao, I made a little chibi clay figure of Deidara from Naruto. (I'm aware of the irony; that's a quarter of the reason why I did it.) I haven't baked him yet because I'm still trying to decide whether I should give him arms or not. Anywho, I'd started another figure - this time of chibi Orochimaru - after showing the Deidara figure to Lauren. I started making Orochimaru down cellar because she was sleeping over that night and we wanted to watch reruns of Naruto (hence, my yen for sculpting), and I needed extra details on everyone's favorite hebiyarou. After Lauren left, I brought the paper on which I'd been sculpting upstairs so I could finish later.

Today, I realized that the paper, Deidei-kun, and the pieces of Oro-san are missing.

;-; I've been looking, but I misses them.

On a side note, I'm steadily getting over my laryngitis. I can hit G above the octave again. Yay."

A few hours ago, Heath Ledger was found dead in an apartment. Cause of death is believed to be accidental overdose on sleeping pills; according to family members, Ledger had had pneumonia problems prior to his death.

I always liked Heath Ledger. As well as being really attractive, he was a great actor - never shoving his way to the limelight, just appearing there when he deserved it. He didn't need to make himself seem any particular way; he just was the way he was and never lied for the sake of publicity. My thoughts and prayers go to him."

And to add to all this, our friend Mr. Falwell tried to connect&nbsp;these innocent groups&nbsp;to 9/11!&nbsp;The attacks&nbsp;happened because of people just like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson - religious extremists, willing to kill innocent people to prove their point, however absurd, horrible, and stupid that point is.&nbsp; Mom always told me never to trust anyone who gets overzealous about ANYTHING.

I've stopped questioning my religion&nbsp;simply because&nbsp;of who follows it, since like the people I was just trying to protect,&nbsp;the extremists&nbsp;are&nbsp;saying and doing what they believe is right. But I DON'T LIKE THESE PEOPLE. I believe that God may forgive them, but it would take a long time to rid these people of their hate, prejudice, and fear.&nbsp;"

I love her.&nbsp;<br /><br />We don't let Treusy upstairs anymore because if she finds anything that feels or sounds even remotely like cat litter, she pees on it. We're not sure of the real reason she does this, but that's my theory. We've tried everything - a second litterbox, different litter, the spray bottle. She still makes messes. I have been patient and cleaned up a lot of these messes for around ten years.<br /><br />Tonight, she peed on my backpack. I was very upset - disappointed, mad, scared that we might get rid of her. I started to cry because the emotions were too much.<br /><br />I'm crying again because my parents just told me that when I leave for college (in more than a year), they are going to give Chartreuse away. They don't want to put up with her messes anymore. They did it for this long because I love her and refuse to get rid of her. I know she's badly behaved, and most owners wouldn't have kept her this long. But I love her too much to think about getting rid of her, even if I do still have a year of her. What if her new owners&nbsp;are mean to her once they discover her problem? What if she ends up living outside again? Why can't she just be a good cat? What will I do without her? Why can't I stop thinking about this?&nbsp;I love her too much.</p>"

"event","<p>WHOA. Okay, this is really freaky. My current character in New Wind is named Lannique Veri. I came up with the name Lannique by myself in the middle of the night, and I thought it was completely original. I was wrong. I got 488 results on Google for ""lannique."" One of them happened to be a name analysis site. I went to the page and clicked on ""Lannique.""<br /><br />The name analysis matches me perfectly, except for one part about a liking for fine foods leading to a liking for alcohol. I like expensive food, but I hate the taste of alcohol. All the rest of the analysis, though - feeling emotions too deeply for my own good, using music to channel my emotions and achieve balance, belief in one true love, liking to make others happy - it's me, completely! Could I have come up with Lannique because that's my dream name, or my true name? I realize I sound really fantasy right now, but still.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.just-think-it.com/sbn/933.htm"">http://www.just-think-it.com/sbn/933.htm</a></p>"

"event","I would like to take a moment to discuss the characters on TV I've had crushes on in the past, and why. This is mostly the result of me reading TV Recaps on televisionwithoutpity.com, but whatever.

Kenshin from ""Rurouni Kenshin"" - My first ever anime crush. He was a complete&nbsp;sweetheart, but also a deadly murderous guy when someone&nbsp;needed protecting. He also had&nbsp;really pretty hair.&nbsp;^_^;; I like guys with long hair.

Soujiro from RK - I can't think of one RK fan who didn't love Soujiro. So cute and smiley and angsty and mistreated... You just wanna hug him and cry!

Danny from ""Danny Phantom"" - ...I was 14, okay?! Besides, he was really cool! Ghost-power was so underused a few years ago! Everyone's all like ""OMG, robots, samurai, and guns"", but ghosts are very underrated. And again, slight obsession with hairstyles. Danny has awesome hair.

Alucard from ""Hellsing"" - Since Alucard's a given at this point in my life and my LJ, I won't mention him. (pause) Damn. Well, what most of you don't know is, at first I didn't have a crush on him. I think I mentioned before that Alucard was one of the few main&nbsp;characters in anime who could be a non-bishie and get away with it. Well, after seeing the OVA and the manga, I can still say he is not a bishie. But he is so damn cool, indestructible, and delightfully sadistic&nbsp;that he is unbelievably sexy.&nbsp;More so in the OVA than anywhere else. Yum.

Dr. House from ""House, MD"" - I don't really have much of a crush on House, seeing as the fact that he's old enough to be my dad is kind of a turnoff. But I do like him a lot. House is kind of attractive. And amazingly smart, which I like in most people (like Rene and most of my guy friends). His sarcasm, general distrust of humanity, and lie-detector abilities remind me a lot of my own dad. Also, his eyes are soooo pretty.... (long pause)

Hiro Nakamura from ""Heroes"" - He's just so adorable! He's the only one in the whole series who actually LIKES his power from the start. I love how happy he gets when he's done something he's proud of. I've always thought that nerdy otakus and book-lovers like him were the cutest things ever. (coughYomikocough) And of course, being a nerd myself, I feel a connection to him. He's so sweet and kawaii!

Mohinder Suresh from ""Heroes"" - Yes, nearly every guy on Heroes is amazingly hot&nbsp;(even Sylar is somewhat attractive), but Mohinder is a different kind of bishy. Even though he doesn't have superpowers,&nbsp;I love him&nbsp;anyway. He's awesome. And uber-hot. My guys-with-long-hair fetish comes into play yet again, as well as a certain attraction to guys with British accents. But also, even though this sounds corny, I love his dedication to finding everyone and saving them from Sylar, and he seems deeper than most of the other characters, what with his connection to his father and sister.

That's all I can think of. Hopefully at least a few of you will come up with some complete deeper meaning to my liking of these guys, but your deductions will be faulty somehow. Trust me, I know it."

"event","<p>So I've been spazzing out for the past four days because I couldn't find my graphing calculator, my purse, or (worst of all) my cell phone. My parents were most pissed about the cell phone because they'd have to keep on paying for it even if I wasn't using it. I searched the whole house for it - every place it could have gone. I found the car keys, a few missing pieces of my mind, and some fuzzies, but no phone. So my parents punished me with No Anime Club.<br /><br />Today, I was very down in the dumps about my lack of cellular phone. I was just looking up a few sites where I could get a replacement phone when Dad walked in - carrying my phone!!!!!!! I was so happy that&nbsp;I&nbsp;actually wanted to do&nbsp;my homework! I danced and squee-d all around and spazzed joyfully. So tonight I can finally sleep easy.<br /><br />In other news, this little bit of hilarity popped up on Homestar Runner. Sever your leg, please, sir. It's the greatest day.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.homestarrunner.com/drivethru.html"">www.homestarrunner.com/drivethru.html</a><br /><br />Cole has started making up his own songs on the piano.

Apparently, I went to the Humane Society, and found him sitting on the front desk and volunteers and employees stuffed into the kennels. XD Sounds like an Alucardkitty, alright.)&nbsp;<br /><br />And lastly, I have discovered a new contestant in the Longest-Tongue-EVER competition. OROCHIMARU'S TONGUE MAKES GENE SIMMONS AND ALUCARD LOOK LIKE THREE-YEAR-OLDS MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE! It's so <em><strong>scary</strong></em>... I betcha he can groom his eyebrows with that thing.

IT WAS AWESOME! Lauren and I hugged each other and stared wide-eyed whenever Alucard did something particularly awesome, and Lauren kept on freaking over the amazing detail and beauty of the art.<br /><br />As to the show itself...Dude! The art was beautiful, the voice-actors were kicking utter ass, and the characters were much more believable! Lauren was happiest that they'd worked on their accents (all except Crispin Freeman, because Alucard has no accent). It was also completely dramatic at times, but still knew how to work in really funny moments (like Seras's dream...or Seras waking up from her dream and checking if her boobs are healed, and then figuring out that Alucard is sitting on the bed watching her XD)&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of characters... Alucard: Still a sexy beast, but now more noticeably so. Integra: much more feminine, while still retaining that leadership that knows no gender. Anderson: Screw what I said in an earlier entry about his accent! Steven Brand got much more into his character this time around; Anderson is so insane it's scary!The biggest and most impressive change so far: Seras! She's so much less annoying and whiny and bitchy and so much more kickass!&nbsp;<br /><br />Brynnie's best quote:<br />""Awww, daddy's little girl!"" (my comment when&nbsp;Seras' eyes went red and she did an Alucard smirk right before pwning a crapload of ghouls)<br /><br />Best quote in the show:<br />""Why didn't you just drink the blood, you idiot?!""<br />-Alucard berating Seras for not becoming a True Vampire when she had the chance<br /><br />Gotta go.

"event","<p>...... It's time I came clean. I'm sick of living this lie. I need to tell the truth so I can&nbsp;make peace&nbsp;with myself and my anime fandom.<br /><br /><br /><br />I still like Pokemon.<br /><br />The show is still pretty stupid in my mind, but every so often, I'll catch myself watching one of the new episodes. I never had the heart to throw away my cards. And I STILL love the movies, no matter what people say. But I don't like how they keep making new Legendary Pokemon. They're freaking LEGENDARY. Shouldn't there only be a few Pokemon who live forever?<br /><br />You see, the real reason I'm still a fangirl is because of Mew and Mewtwo. Those guys were the COOLEST.&nbsp;I even memorized he entire first Movie, word for word, action for action. I was THAT obsessed. I think the reason I love fight scenes so much (Kenshin and Shishio, Alucard and Anderson, Yomiko and Ridley *mangaverse*, etc) is because of the fight between Mew and Mewtwo. I even made my first Mary-Sue for them! (An eleven-year-old named Caroline (""Cat"") Castino. I have&nbsp;a bajillion&nbsp;fanfictions about Cat and her big sister (Kit) fighting alongside Mew and Mewtwo stashed up in my room.) I was obsessed with them well into the eighth grade, so great was my love.<br /><br />The real first thing I liked was Mew. A cute little fuzzy pink kitty-thing that sat on a windmill and behaved like a curious child. Being ten, I was hooked. But as I grew, Mew became cool in other ways. Yes, he was a fuzzy pink kitty still, but he also had amazing power. Something THAT cute can take on something as cool and powerful and almost-evil as Mewtwo - and make it out without a scratch? That is freaking awesome.&nbsp;(Though I still can't find anyone else who agrees with me that Mew is a boy.)<br /><br />And Mewtwo? He's the REASON I like anime bad guys. He was just so cool.&nbsp;His voice was awesome, he was powerful beyond belief, he could TALK, he could build a working cloning device&nbsp; (and a castle!)&nbsp;in 3 weeks&nbsp;- and he made being strong and intelligent look like the easiest thing ever. I mean, the&nbsp;guy made a devastating storm, bad enough to close down a whole harbor, just by spinning his hand in a circle.&nbsp;But&nbsp;the other reason I liked him was that I&nbsp;felt kinda bad for him. He wasn't really evil, he was just sick of being used by humans as a weapon/lab rat. (Well, lab cat, but you get the idea.)<br /><br />My fandom having been expressed, I have toned down my obsession a LOT. Ask Lauren. But every now and then, I find myself missing my old fandom. I mean, it was my first anime. It deserves more attention than I give it at times. But everyone still thinks Pokemon is stupid. I can't argue with them because deep down, I know it got old after about&nbsp;five seasons and twenty sets of cards. But what i can't explain is that I don't like the NEW stuff. It's the old stuff, the movies and the first two seasons of the show, that first got me interested and that I still love.<br /><br />...I am SO glad I got that out of my system. </p>"

"event","<p>New Year's and Christmas were uber-fun! I got a crapload of Nightmare Before Christmas stuff, tickets to Spamalot, a freakin' CELL PHONE (oh yes, you heard me right), and bracelets and necklaces and a lot of money. I intend to save part of the money for AnimeNEXT and spend the rest on Hellsing-related items. OK, fine, the OVA. Can you blame me? Lauren ordered it before I did just because she knew it would piss me off. Grah.&nbsp;<br /><br />As for New Years', Kimi (my oldest friend, we've been friends since kindergarten)&nbsp;invited me over, I learned how to play racing games, and Kimi attacked me with a remote-control helicopter. At about 10:30, she got an idea and went like ""wait right here."" Then she ran upstairs. When she came down, she was wearing a fluffy white tutu, black hooker boots, and a tiara. My response: ""Oh...my...God."" So then we got me into her leopard-print top, a beach sarong and brown cowboy boots. Then we danced. A Lot. To whatever music we felt like. The list included ""Die Another Day"", ""Eat the Rich"", ""Walk This Way"", and most memorably, ""Funky Cold Medina."" We lit off firecrackers at midnight. Fun.<br /><br />Today was the first day back at school after a long and lazy vacation. I flipped out to everyone about my fork-bracelet from Terry and my Anime Insider from Mom and Dad. Lauren loved my Jack Skellington keychain. But today was very mood-swingy for a few people. Lauren, for instance, had her day go from awesome to shit in three seconds flat. And Cole found out that he can't quit band even though he really wants to. As for me, I was pretty happy and relaxed most of the day, and was honored by Shayna because she did that comic of me doing karaoke. She also did an amazing drawing of her character, Kellie, doing an Alucard pose from Volume 2 - one of my favorite Alucard poses (keep in mind there are a lot).<br /><br />When I got home, Terry was playing Linkin Park. Since music influences my mood very easily, I ran upstairs so I wouldn't be able to hear it. Then I came back down to work on the comic I'm doing about my New Year's Resolutions. Since i was starting to feel a little blue already, I logged on here and looked at my friends page to see if anything interesting was there.<br /><br />Something was.<br /><br />This webpage really brightened my day. It's one of the few things I've laughed out loud about for a little while. And yes, the article here is Hellsing-related, but that's because it came from a Hellsing livejournal group. The website is kind of a Wikipedia parody, and this is their article on Hellsing.<br /><br />First, the description of Hellsing wih a few well-placed quotes.<br /><a href=""http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Hellsing"">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Hellsing</a><br /><br />Then, their description of Alucard.&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Hellsing#Alucard"">http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Hellsing#Alucard</a><br /><br />I agree with them: ""God of All That is Awesome"" sounds quite a bit like Alucard. But I think that title may already belong to Chuck Norris. And you know what THAT means....<br /><br />WE MUST HAVE A SHOWDOWN OF AWESOMENESS!!!!</p>"

First, it was just a minor headache. Then I started getting really cold. Then my throat felt funny and i got kind of tired. It got so bad that Scott actually ended the game early.

I did, but I couldn't turn on my side like I usually do when I'm sleeping, because at that point my stomach had started to feel bad.<br /><br />Starting at 5 PM and going on till 9, I was barfing my guts out.

It was like a musical, but wiht wayyy more comedy than musicals normally have. It's like ""Spamalot"" meets Pirates of the Caribbean.&nbsp;<br /><br />The guy who played Frederic, Jason Michael Snow? He looks EXACTLY like a long-haired version of Scott! (Tho' Shayna says he's too short...) And MAN. Andrew Varela, who played the Pirate King, is SO COOL. He's like a singing Johnny Depp! Other awesome stuff included Mabel's entrance (who wouldn't want the one they're gonna&nbsp;marry to just sail in on a hot-air balloon from Hammerspace?), the vacant smiles of Major General Stanley's daughters, the freakin' PARROT (""GET IT OFF! GET IT OFF!!!""), and the dancing Caribbean policemen. I can't even attempt to do the Tarantara they did. I tried in the nook yesterday, but Shayna was like, ""No... you're too white."" Ah well. She and I will be making Pirates of Penzance jokes for a long time. ""Wait... that means... you LIED!"" and ""Quiet, peanut, the<em> men</em> are talking....!""<br /><br />Also, my mom and I have seen a pattern emerging when i go to the Goodspeed. In one of the first few plays I went to, ""Red, Hot and Blue"", there was a wedding scene at the very end. The main character, Nails Ducane, threw the bouquet - and I caught it and won a CD. Then during ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"", Milly accidentally threw her ladle. Once again, I caught it. And now, at Pirates, Ruth threw a gold chocolate coin at me. Coincidence?

"event","<p>Sooooo.&nbsp;This journal entry will consist of two parts: an entry I've been meaning to post for a while now, and my day today.<br /><br />Part A: A few days ago, as I was getting my PJs on, I realized that my PJs for that night - a black tank top w/ a shelf bra&nbsp;and a grey skort - looked a little like Envy's outfit. So I tucked part of the tank top under the shelf bra and added black socks. Not bad!&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the next few days, I kept on tweaking the outfit. I looked more realistic with&nbsp;a normal tank top, tying the rest of it up with a scrunchie. I also tied two of my dark brown stretchy socks together to make a headband (I don't own any black stretchy socks). I showed it to Cole, who didn't really get it (he's only watched FMA AMVs and the OVAs on YouTube).<br /><br />Me: All i need now is an Ouruboros tattoo on my left thigh, and a green wig.<br />Cole: And you'll be... Greed?<br />Me: O__o Envy! Greed's the one with the fur thing on his coat!<br /><br />(How he mixed up Greed and Envy, I'll never know.)<br /><br />The only problem I have is my hair. Much as I wish I could have any anime hairstyle I wanted, I can't suddenly sprout a palm tree out of my head. I tried getting my hair wet, but I ended up looking more like Kimbley in his prison days.Now I'm wondering if i could pull off Lust. I do own a strapless...<br /><br />Part B: WARNING: THIS PART CONTAINS GIRL TALK. DO NOT READ IF YOU HATE ICKY STUFF. (I would do the link-in-post thingy i've seen so many people do, but I don't know how.)<br /><br />I woke up at 3 in the morning with the second-worst case of cramps I have ever had (the first worse was the first time I ever got cramps). I stayed awake for about an hour, writhing on my bed,&nbsp;using the heating pad,&nbsp;waiting&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Maximum-Strength Pamprin to kick in and wishing i could just go to sleep. Sometime after 4:30, I finally did. But MAN. Looking back, I think I was way worse off than normal. I had these really weird dreams that in the morning I couldn't remember. The only other time that happened is when I had my kidney infection (during which Mom said I also talked in my sleep). Also, when I woke up at 6-ish, I was sweating all over. Seriously, my PJs were completely soaked. Mom realized how bad it was immediately with her mom-senses when she came upstairs to wake me up. She and I discussed whether I'd be able to go to school (yes) and whether I would get sick again later. Then she let me go back to sleep for another hour.<br /><br />I got to school okay, and except for a little pain during history, I was fine. But I still wonder why I seem to get cramps so much worse than the girls I know. Maybe I should ask my doctor about it or something.<br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","Hellsing Ultimate OVA trailer in English. <br /><br />I'll say that again for anyone who doesn't believe me. <br /><br />Hellsing Ultimate OVA Trailer in English. <br /><br />ZOMG. <br /><br />Crispin Freeman is back and still amazing! He's doing wayyyy&nbsp;better as Alucard than in the TV anime!&nbsp;Victoria Harwood really missed being Integra (I can tell by how good she was). I didn't hear much of K.T. Gray (aka Seras), but judging from what i did hear, she's doing a much better job - more emotion in the acting, less emo in the Seras. Steven Brand did pretty good as Anderson again, but his accent needs polishing. But overall.... I've got chills and am just barely restraining myself from going into spazzy fangirl mode at this very moment. <br /><br />HELLSING IN ENGLISH. <br /><br />It's becoming so much more REAL in my mind now.&nbsp;I felt like the Hellsing OVA was never gonna come to America. I had almost given up hope. But now... the possibility and the eventuality is so tangible, it's scary. It's almost intimidating. Will it be too cool to watch? <br /><br />Yes. <br /><br />Do I care?&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes. <br /><br />Will I watch it anyway? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Of COURSE.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.hellsingultimate.com"">http://www.hellsingultimate.com</a>"

"event","<p>Sooooooo Justine had a b-day party last night. Which I attended as well as Shayna, Scott, Zeke (gasp! they're in the&nbsp;same place?!),&nbsp;Ivanna, Catherine, Marissa, and Lauren.&nbsp;Apparently,&nbsp;Justine&nbsp;is even younger than Ivanna and everyone knew this but me. And also, she lives in the same house my friend Sydney lived in when I was a kid! Dude! And it's sooooo pretty, she's got her Christmas stuff out already and the fire was going and wow. Didn't expect such beauty, really.<br /><br />We went to a Chinese restaurant near Loews avec Justine's grandparents and mom. Anyone else think that Chinese restaurants smell disgusting? I do. Justine lectured me about Wonderland; Shayna and Ivanna gave her Halloween stuff we found at Wal-Mart, I gave her a&nbsp;gift-card, and Scott and Zeke gave her earrings. Scott told me later that he picked out both pairs. He will have no trouble with women in his life at this rate.&nbsp;Justine actually started crying after&nbsp;Lauren and i sang in harmony to her. She&nbsp;said she was really happy to have so many friends. Then we all went to her house&nbsp;and we chilled. With a ferret and a mouse.<br /><br />How cool are we, huh?<br /><br />Scott mentioned in the car that he and Heather may break up. That'd be a little unsettling, because I like Heather and it seems like she and Scott get along great. I used to use them as a model for long-distance relationships working out.... I guess not.<br /><br />I think I left my bag at Justine's. I'll call her later.</p>"

"event","<p>As posted by gouka-san, they are doing construction on our school and they put up a new wall in the cafeteria. The people at our table were upset at losing the windows, so Mr. Papa (the vice principal) said we could draw just one. Shayna drew one (with Godzilla outside it). Then the seniors started drawing, and pretty soon we were all drawing on the wall.&nbsp;<br /><br />The seniors drew a little border, and Shayna drew a little Mexican hopping over it. I drew a Jack Skellington and a Domo-kun, which Shayna promptly changed to ""Domo-kun, MD"" due to his faded right leg; she added a cane and an angry vein sticking out of his head. Lauren drew a girl pointing to the fire exit, and a girl wondering if they knew there was a hole in the ceiling. Then Justine drew an angry chocolate bar whose name escapes me. It was all good fun... until the car ride home from Anime Club, when I learned from Scott that the wall was now un-paintable for the construction guys because permanent marker bleeds through. (Cory says whitewashing the wall first&nbsp;can help, but if that's true, why didn't the builders know it?) Mr. Papa took the heat, since he's the one who told us it was okay to draw on the wall.&nbsp;All we got was an order not to draw on the wall anymore.&nbsp;Once again, all was good...<br /><br />FLAME ON.<br /><br />Today, when I walked into the lunch room, I saw that more had been added to the wall. On our side. And it WASN'T&nbsp;anyone from anime club - it was FILTHY SOPHOMORES AND SENIORS. Someone named ""Alyssa"" tried to take credit for Lauren's amazing artwork! (Thankfully, that was scribbled out, probably by Lauren herself.) Someone wrote the word STUPID with an arrow pointing to Domo-kun, MD! Someone scribbled out Shayna's drawing of Luke from ""Hellsing"" getting eaten by a doggy, and wrote next to it, ""That is SO disgusting!!"" And worst of all...<br /><br />DEVYN (who I know and greatly dislike) WROTE HER NAME IN BIG LETTERS ALL OVER SHAYNA'S WINDOW!!!!!<br /><br />That window is a piece of history! It's the window that started it all!!! And DEVYN just goes and RUINS it! On PURPOSE! How DARE she take credit for Shayna's work! That girl has messed with me for the LAST time!!! (She probably even knows she messed with me... she knows I'm in Anime Club. Bitch.)<br /><br />I already wanted to do something extraordinarily painful to her, but now I want to cause her pain, kill her, and resurrect her so I can kill her again! Then I'll kill her unborn babies to make sure they don't pass on the stupid gene.<br /><br />FLAME OFF.<br /><br />(breath) On a lighter note, we're gonna have Movie Night soon. I'm thinkin' Cowboy Bebop. Or Conqueror of Shambala, if we haven't all seen it already.</p>"

"event","Our computadora broke. Badly. Dad took it to the Geek Squad and they said it was unfixable. Not good. We're using Terry's computer in the meantime. Hope he doesn't mind.<br /><br />School-wise. Not fun in the homework department. I seem to have this major-league problem with getting my assignments done on time. I almost cried in English. Twice. I think I might talk to Miss Porter or someone about this, cause after a teacher catches you crying, they treat you... differently. Like you're weak or different. They treat you with caution.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a lighter note, a new campaign of New Wind has started. My new character ROCKS. I'm a Green, which is like an elf and a plant mixed together. So people freak out over me like I'm Elphaba (""No offense, miss, but you're green...""); also, I have no blood, only chloroplasts, so when this guy stabbed me, I bled green. Sweeeet. OH! And I can regenerate by going out in the sun!&nbsp;<br /><br />""A regenerator... a&nbsp;PLANT regenerator!""<br /><br />Shayna and Ivanna joined in, and Cory decided he was going to be a Void (magic repelling being) who worships the goddess of pain, Seken. This is because my last character, Cailian Ebony, the elven bard/retainer of Helen (muse of peace), was freaked out by Voids and attacked by worshipers of Seken twice. Shayna couldn't decide what race to be, so Scott grabbed her sheet and wrote ""Rat Thing"" in the spot that said ""Race."" Ivanna was more of an observer than a New Wind participant; we could have made her a female orc with agoraphobia and a fetish for smelling feet, and she'd have been fine.<br /><br />Highlight of the evening (for the other guys):<br /><br />Scott (reciting events in game): Ivanna notices something shiny. Being an elf, she's the first one to notice it.<br />Me (mock offended): Oh, so the elves are Jews now! (slaps hand over mouth, suddenly remembering that there are two Jews and one ex-Jew in the house)<br />Everyone else: KYAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!<br /><br />Oh God... I can't believe I said that. Thankfully, no-one took offense; they all just laughed, Shayna hugged me, and Scott's mom cracked up in the other room. To think that I said that! Little Miss Anti-racism! Dude!<br /><br />At school today: Lauren lent me Yami no matsuei Volume 3.&nbsp;Scott&nbsp;became a manga critic during lunch.&nbsp;<br /><br />.........<br />...............<br />....................<br /><br />I think calling it ""soft-core porn"" was a little extreme. Just a little, but still.<br /><br />And only <u>Hisoka</u> <em>really </em>looks like a girl. Muraki's too broad-shouldered to be a girl!<br /><br />Besides which, what was he trying to prove when he kept trying to show me that not all shounen-ai is sexy? Is he offended, or is he just trying to figure me out?<br /><br />HE CANNOT STOP MY LOVE FOR SHOUNEN AI!!!!"

As I admired his talent in gothic-looking art, I noticed a thumbnail for a picture of Alucard.<br /><br />The picture that loaded following my click was an absolutely breathtaking picture of Alucard, strolling toward the screen, his guns held out on either side, blood staining his usual fanged grin.<br /><br />But the drawing was not an original work of Mr. Lupin, which he clearly stated at the bottom:<br /><br />""ALL CREDIT FOR THE PIC GOES TO YUKARI-SAN!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;You must visit Solid and Etc.....&nbsp;wonderful works.....""&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />His words gave me the means to find the greatest gallery of Hellsing art I have ever seen since I first became a Hellsing fan.

"event","So. Anime Club has three times its former membership. We are now officially popular. At least among the freshmen brave enough to join.

Our club should be called ""United Nerd Nations."" Dude, that should be a separate club at the school - in fact, it'd be our sister club! But I digress.

Shayna made a Ryuk-stick to pass around (half of us gushed over the sexiness, the rest of us were all like, ""Keep that disturbing thing away from me"") so we wouldn't be like Eris and Loki had had babies noise-wise. And we introduced ourselves (Scott is the King of Nerds now, apparently), Lauren listed a fraction of the anime she owns (it took up the entire board), ad I attacked Scott for saying ""Believe it."" (Then Lauren said ""sit"", so I fell down. Most people got the reference and laughed.)

My moral dilemma is this: I just discovered that someone has uploaded the first episode of the Hellsing OVA onto YouTube. I really wanna watch it... but I'll own it in less than two months... but it's so tempting... but it will spoil the surprise... GRAH. I'm gonna write a comic about this later.

Now I'd better go. I have a report to do that's gonna kill me if I don't do it."

That last entry was an autosave from Tuesday, I think. But here's a few things from this weekend I need to tell:

GSA had a movie night and showed ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" It's nowhere near as disturbing as I recall. We went to visit Terry at his college. Gave him an Ice-Bat Uglydoll, a pumpkin, and a vacuum (he really needed it XD). His college is really big and pretty. It's more like a small town than a college campus. And with Terry around, we became more bickery than ever as Cole tried to show how good he was at annoying me now, and as I tried to verbally murder Cole. Mom and dad were astonished - we haven't fought that way in ages.

Fun!

But what the title is all about is this: I posted on the AnimeNEXT forums about how I have finally come down to either being Yomiko again next year, or being Secretary Sheska from FMA. (She's Yomiko's daughter - I know it!) It should also be noted that I use Sloganizer for my signature on the board; the phrase I sloganized is ""Steven Blum"". As I posted the message, I noticed what my sig now read:

""My Steve Blum is mine.""

Me pointing out lots of stuff like how eerily this one costume looked like Dream from <em>The Sandman.</em> Scott buying Lauren a whip for her birthday (extremely appreciated by Lauren). Danny then attacking people with the whip. We went into Borders at one point, too, and I hunted for Mightwish CDs, found one, and since I couldn't buy it, I just rubbed it all over my chest. Then Scott bought it 'cause he's a jerk with money.

"event","Oh, poop. I typed in a saved entry and it didn't go to the day I really typed it, which was at most three Saturdays ago. Well, here's the real thing I wanted to post today...

My friend Scott called me at 8:30 last night. I was busy, but I picked up anyway.

""Hey Scott.""
""brynn, I just had the best idea ever. I need your help.""

His plan was this: he had a leather coat, black pants, black gloves and boots, a gray fedora hat, and one of those black faceless Halloween masks. He was gonna wear it to school tomorrow. In the middle of lunch, I was supposed to turn on the CD player he brought, which was stuck on Queen's song ""I am Invisible Man."" He had a dance all prepared and needed me to hook up the sound. I told him that he had gone clinically insane, but so had I, because yes, I was gonna help him. 

Today, I woke up with real motivation. Scott came on to the bus in full costume. All through the morning, people asked him ""Who are you supposed to be?"" He didn't answer them, and I walked up to them and said, ""I can't tell you all the details, but during lunch, he's going to pull the craziest stunt he's ever thought of."" Most people knew it was Scott (he's too tall to be hidden easily), and they know him as the one who actually goes through with crazy stuff like this.

Unfortunately, the staff made him take off the outfit. The faceless mask scared them because he could've been anyone. I was disappointed - the punishment would've been so worth it. Oh well. School is still cooler with him there to act on insane whims."

"event","I love Hellsing! I won't lie! I love Hellsing almost more than... peanut butter, and that didn't rhyme! Woo!

So, yeah. I want an alucard costume! My new ambition is to own that long red coat, kick-A hat, patterned gloves... oooooooh, it's so cool. and Alucard is the one anim character i know who can be the lead guy, be unattractive, and still be the coolest ever.

I discovered this world-class series at Shayna's house, after Anime Club. I had heard about hellsing for a while now, but never acually seen it. My quote and hers throughout the show:

""He's so cool!""
""I know!""

So now I'm a Hellsing fan. Yay.

"event","Yes, I know it's been a while since I updated. Yes, I know I've been going to that heathen site, Myspace.com. Yes, I know it's a bad image for the site. But none of that matters right now.

I saw Date Movie. It was hilarious. I liked the scene where they were about to have a Kill Bill Fu battle. I saw Fame. Greatest 80's movie trying to be a musical ever. Really. But they cut a lot. Also, (and all my fellow anime peeps will be proud)...........

I've discovwered Hellsing.

Scott was wrong. I liked it. I saw, like, the first seven episodes before before it was late and I finally said to Shayna, ""I think we've seen enough Hellsing."" Man, I get nervous even typing that sentence. It feels like if I try to type it, I'll end up with that uberly awesome gun of Alucard's pressed against my head. Or worse, Seras's hugeass missile-laucher type gun. The scene where she got that gun was my favorite. And now my energy is requiring Dance Dance revolution to get it out. Twitchy.

"event","About last entry: they found Shannon's mum's super-valuable sword collection. Not the crap kind you buy in a magazine - real swords. So, that's all good.

In other news, Mom and Dad found the book and papers showing names they were considering for me. They were weird. My dad wanted to name me Rocco or Hogan if I was a boy, and Carissa or Rikki if I was a girl. He loved the name Ellery Bryn for me. (Where's the other N? I dunno.) Mom wanted to name me Claire or Brenna if I was a girl, and Quinn or Riley if I was a boy. My parents were overly influenced by Ireland, in my opinion - not that that's a bad thing. I wouldn't have minded being named Quinn or Carissa, I suppose, but Ellery sounds kinda funky to me. 

Also, found a geneaology book of my dad's. Lemme tell ya... there is nothing weirder than seeing your great grandma's name in a book. (I'm named after her - her name was Margaret, which is my middle name.) So that is all. Lay-tair."

"event","Whoa. Just whoa. This girl I know, Shannon, who lives near my friend Lauren? Her house just burned down.

Yeah. Everything's gone. The family's fine, but they don't know what happened to their cat. There was a smell of gin and vodka, according to Lauren, who's known Shannon for a while. Whether or not this had to do with the fire is unknown. But geez. I've never heard of someone remotely connected to me having their house burn down. What happened from my POV was this: my dad, my brother and I were driving to the chiropractor when a fire engine went by. I pretended to have my seatbelt on, then when our appointment was through, we went to Blockbuster. As I was looking in the horror section, Dad's phone rang, and he handed it to me, saying it was Mom. Mom told me to call Lauren right away, but she didn't say why, she just said something bad had happened. I called Lauren.

""Hello?""
""Hey, it's me.""
""Hey. Oh my God.""
""What?""
""Shannon's house is on fire.""

So yeah. Kind of a shocker.

"event","So erm, yeh, havent filled this in for ages. erm. yeh, went to thorpe park. got very sunburnt, saw kill bill 2, was fab, worked a lot. meh. OOOOO saw derren brown, fuckin awesome. Erm, then the week sucked. Stupid newspaper printed some shit bout a new drug for Multiple Sclerosis, and my dad seems to be convinced its gonna be some fucking wonder drug that'll cure my mum. I don't like to be all negative but we kinda went thru this wit beta interferon and this drug is totally still in testing. It's jus totally gay cos he seems to think this is gonna make her be able to walk again and im really worried that she believes him. Fucking Daily Mail. Infact I think I shall write the editor a very strongly worded letter. Lol. Saw Denz this friday, had people over, they did this really really funny thing on distraction where u had to fit as many clothes pegs on ur face as u could, i have never seen anything quite as funny. Have to try it out and take photos! Went out for a meal wit Denz saturday, it was nice :-) was early tho cos had to work thismorning which wasn't near as bad as i thought, kinda nice bein alone in the store, chilled out. could go smoke wen i want and stuff. Oh, stuart got accomadation list thru this week. I can't live wit him :'(

"event","saw denz again today, he's pretty. watched the end of the irish film we were watchin in media, had a much happier ending than i expected which was very cool. that was the only lesson i went to, me and hattie justified not goin to photography, fuck knows how but we did. Crazy things going on in the world of men. Would quite happily tell them all to go to hell and become gay. Meh. I spose denz is very cute. Argh! I dunno. We'll see...
Thorpe park tomorrow!!!! YAY!!! so cool! im being all mum like and making a picnic! hehe! It's gonna be well good! Work was dull, although the crazy man from the balti cuisine came in and bought a trolley full of eggs that i found well funny, it had about 40 boxes full atleast, i told him to take the trolley over there and bring it back later hehe."

"event","well! Thought i was gonna be wide awake today cos got like nearly 9 hours sleep, but no. dragged self from bed at 10am, slapped on minimal make-up hence looked like poo. Went to film studies which was cool, chattin to Andy (film teacher) bout Greg Araki movies...is it possible to be a fan of his films without being a pervert? well if not then label me a perv. And my film teacher. After that I had a bizarre yet amusing conversation with weird Matt from photog about his job as a fishmonger lol. He wants to do ""something no one else CAN do"" for his final peice for photography, turns out he's been doing photography since he was like 10, i think his dad's pretty down with it so yay for him! So when I got home, my bro was all ""can u do my homework for me?"" and i did. like the fool i am. Only on the condition he drove me to college to hand in my work and then drove me to the pub thisevening. Broke my no napping rule and fell asleep for like 2 hours thisafternoon...oops. Oh god i'm so boring and old its depressing. Oh well, so was all like ""arggh!! seeing Denz!"" parents made me eat dinner wit them and interrogated me about mr denz and wen i sed i was thinkin bout telin him i wasnt interested my dad was all liek ""noooo, dont do that!""...okay dad...
Got to pub, was jus me, lucy, lauryn and mr james, was pretty cool wen denz got there cos normally lucy is wit dan and me and la are by ourselves but it was reversed! mwahahaha! Have decided to give Denz a chance, he's terribly cute and has such soft hands :P i dont know...im so shallow it's unreal. Ooo saw some people from secondary school so went and sed hello, was a bit weird. Lauryn gave me a lift home which was cool, talked about friday and how we're gettin to Thorpe Park and stuff...have a terrifying feeling they're gonna drag me on all the rides...may have to pack some valium in my handbag friday morning."

"event","i awoke to a card from my aunt saying ""congrats on being the first budden to go to uni""...a) i HATE my surname, b)i'm not at uni yet.
So off i strutted to college for another fun day of drawing circles; hearing bout my sociology teachers past career wit sainsburys; and watching nuns abuse children.
Stuart and Andy abandoned me after first lesson and went home so i had 2 and a half hours to kill til my next lesson, so i ended up playing shithead wit britta and a load of strangers who i decided i dont like. theyre rude and fuckin mean to eachother. then there was all this craziness goin on wit rumours being spread and shit, so i thought ""eek"" and ran away from scola as it has nothing to do wit me yay :D...makes a nice change not to get caught in the middle of these things (see lauryn, I'm learning). After lunch, photog was boring as ever as everyone fucked off to the computers and stuff, although came up wit a cool plan involving records and cds for my final peice...should be good hopefully. Media was wikky as found out i got 101 marks for my coursework, which means i need 35 marks in the final exam for an A over all...36 marks is an E :D yay! Spent the rest of the lesson watching a depressing film called The Magdalene Sisters, t'is about the nuns in ireland that used to pretty much enslave girls and treat them like shit and stuff. pretty bad. James is blatently ignoring me, which is fun. he was sitting opposite me in media and wouldnt even glance in my direction. dont really care...although i looked at him today and thought...""man u r sooo pretty"" i guess u never know wots gonna happen in the future...i shall content myself wit ""Denz"" (or Scazz as Britta refers to him as ) for the time being. OOh, then popped in to work to get a drink and they said ""cat, u look like shit...go home and take the night off..."" dunno whther to feel offended or grateful to be honest...
So here i am. sitting at home motivating myself to write an essay on the swinging sixties. Am a little sad cos my mate is pretty down right now (cos her fish died) and I don't have a clue what to say to her. Except that fish wasn't good enough and we can go buy her a much better one soon. At a big fish shop where they play music and sell alcohol. So yeh, I'm gonna curl up wit a good movie tonight and chill...can't remember the last time i had a night in...must be atleast a month ago.

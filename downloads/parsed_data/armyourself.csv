"event","One week. I'm not so excited.

A violin, ""The Shepherd's Dog,"" anything Sarah Silverman, and some rollerblades. That's it. I'm not feeling very materialistic these days.

I've been doing cartwheels lately."

"event","I took pictures today for the first time in ever. I won't post them here, as they're already on my Myspace. Yes, my Myspace. 

And honestly, will someone please tell me what is up with the new Silverchair video? Whatever happened to that darling little sixteen year old anorexic boy that I remember? I'm so behind the times.

The majority of my days are spent writing and working out and feeding stray kittens and writing about feeding stray kittens and working out. Occasionally I'll smoke a cigar and think about growing old. I'm terrified to grow old. The idea of losing more friends, more family, makes me feel sick to my stomach. Knowing that it's inevitable is almost too much.

Aside from that, life is great. I like watching Sarah Silverman and playing with my dogs and telling people that my birthday is coming up and eating lots of sushi. 

My birthday is coming up."

"event","Man, sometimes this curiosity just gets to me and I'm overwhelmed with the strongest urges to start talking to him again. Just start talking - say anything. More likely, spill out some horribly unsophisticated, insipid joke that he probably wouldn't even remember as being one of ours in a feeble attempt to show him that I haven't entirely forgotten about the mess we had both, at one point, been so helplessly enveloped by. It's probably better that I don't as our conversations would surely be so surface anyway, and not at all how I imagine they would've been had we continued our liaison. But things get in the way. More appropriately, <i>I</i> got in the way. Me and my appetite for something better. 

At least I know how to do my own Livejournal scheme now."

"event","Today is my best friend's birthday again. It feels like it came around so soon. Three weeks ago was the two year anniversary of her death, and today is the day she would've been entirely legal and I would've nagged her into getting drunk with me and it would've been our first time ever drinking together. But since she had to be a jerk and die I'll probably just end up drinking alone and talking to her pictures."

"event","I agonize over crooked rugs and dusty furnishings and to this day it's done me no good. Sometimes I slip into this trance-like state when someone's talking to me and all I can think is, ""The spacing between those candles is all off,"" or something to that effect and by the time I realize I've stopped paying any attention to whomever I'm speaking to, they've since walked away.

Lately I've been infatuated with the idea of ""expressing myself,"" but honestly I have nothing to say. At least nothing of any importance or magnitude or even cleverness. This has led to other expressive outlets - one such being a tree much taller than myself made of bottle caps ticky-tackied to my living room wall. I've also begun to garden, or more appropriately suck the life from every living thing within twenty or so feet of me. Whatever works, I guess."

"event","Sometimes everything goes white and all of a sudden I'm standing there alone wondering what the hell I'm doing. How is it even possible that I'm still here existing when they're gone. How is it that I can smile and laugh and clean the kitchen and wash my hair and get angry and none of it has anything to do with them. 

I get scared. Maybe someday I'll get to a point where I'll go months without saying their names and maybe someday I won't even cry, I'll just be wistful and nobody will remember how passionately I loved both of them, and I did."

"event","He is bad, he is bad, he is bad but we danced in the middle of the street and he sang Oasis' ""Wonderwall"" in my ear but his voice sounded more like the Ryan Adams version and I imagined him sitting on the sidewalk with an acoustic guitar and that smile and it almost fit too well. And when I asked what he was thinking he just turned his head, took my hand, and we walked back to the party. I can still smell him on my shirt but that is all I have because I cannot get involved with a boy (especially one as charming) who has the potential to hurt me. And this boy, oh he has potential."

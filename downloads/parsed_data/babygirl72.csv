I know i havent even known you that long, but you know how sometimes you just meet someone and right away you can tell what a great friendship you are going to have? Well that is you. I've never been as happy as i have been lately, and its because of the great people like you in my life. And alot of those people i wouldnt of met if it wasnt for you. I feel like ive known you for ever, when really i havent.  I have had so much fun hanging out with you,even if we are just watching Lindsey Lohan movies! haha.

Came home and slept tiill 1:30, then Dave asked me to go to Charlston Falls with him, so i said sure. Cleaned my car and off to daves with my doggy. Dave made me a mix CD i actually really like it! Its the first Mix CD ive ever got! haha. So anyway, I got us kicked out because i went off the trail to let my dog drink some water. This crazy lady like gave us 20 question and even searched my car. I have no clue why. So we went to some other place and as soon as i walked out i got stung and it hurt like hell. I had my phone and my dogs lease in the hand of the arm that got stung threw them both on the ground, my dog went running, Dave tried to catch him but it wasnt working. But Marley came back to me. He is my baby. So we left shortly after that because my arm hurt and i was pooped. So i came home long enough to eat some food, like 10 minutes i was home when Parisa asked me to come hang out, so i did. We went to the mall for a minute to get her pay check, then we went to the movies and saw Wicker Park. It was great. No one was in the theater but us so we could talk and all that stuff haha. It was awesome. Parisa is so cool. We just sit and talk about randomness. So then i came home and here i be!

I realized tonight how really happy i am. I love everyone around me. Everyone who is in my life right now I want all of you to know how happy i am that you are. I cant say ive ever felt this good. Its amazing. 

Thanks to everyone who cares about me.

Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you
Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you

And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two do you?

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you"

Chanie - I REALLY miss you, i never get to see you anymore and i hate it. Your such a great person i wish i knew what was going on with you more! <33

Brian B. -Even though you only talk to me when you randomly have something to tell me. You are still awesome..im glad we ran into each other and actually talk, your a good person. I hope we become better friends. And randomly go eat at O Charleys ha. <333

Erik - I actually didnt think me and you would even last as long as we have because two smartass dont usually mix well together, i think its your fault im loosing my sarcastic/smartass side. Ive been slackin since i met you! But you are such a great person, im really glad we met, its nice to talk to someone with as many opinions as me. Plus you make me laugh. You are going to do something great with yourself..You defiantly have a good head on your shoulder as far as ive seen? <333333  :)

Rosemary- You are someone that im so glad i wasnt all shy and didnt speak up to you that night at El Diablos...And we should still kick him in the balls for dissin on your shoes!! But your are such an amazing person, I love talking to you, because we can talk about the most random thing and it be like a normal conversation about the news or something haha.  Im gonna be so sad when you leave because i didnt get the chance to really get to know you and hang out with you and be best friends forever!! oh sorry haha. But im gonna have to come down and vist you and go window shopping for sure. You are such a great person and are going to do so much with your life, i can tell. Its always a relief to meet someone as genuine and nice as you are. Thank you for giving be the chance and getting to know me, through all that drama and stuff. <3333333 x 80 how cant you love someone that much when you can talk about boys all night hahaha

Mandy - Im soo glad we got to talk again, I had so much fun sitting around with you talking about girlie stuff haha. Even if it does take us forever because we have A.D.D. haha But that was a good night, i really needed that. You are such a good person, and you really deserve so much. I hope you end up so happy, because its what you deserve. <333 We are so going to hang out more. 

Jeff- ahh..I cant even start to say anything about this one. Sometimes i just wonder what to do with myself when your in my life.  Its so weird how i can hang out with you, not doing anything but sitting around watching TV, and just be so happy. I dont get it.  I keep trying to figure out if you are good or bad in my life, because sometimes, i just want to stab you, but then sometimes i just want to kiss you. I dont understand this one bit, and honestly i dont want to think about it either.  I just wish for one day you would hang out with me and talk to me, let me actually get to know Jeff..Because really i dont know all that well, and i hate it.  You have came into my life for some reason i cant figure out..some day i will though. In the end i hope we get to be close friends..because i do know you are a good person, and you have a place in my heart because you changed me for the good and ill forever be thankful to you for that. You made me feel like i was so beautiful and ive never had a guy make me feel that way. Even though im sure it was just sweet talk since your a male and thats what they do ;)(just a joke) I can now say that i have some confidence in my self because of you.  Me and you are good when  we are together..I cant say there has ever been a time i didnt enjoy hanging out with you. And Wow i have a lot to say to you..I guess you can tell you put a mark in my life. Well...moving on...ha

Ash - I wish we hung out more still. I have fun when i hang out with you even if we are just sitting at your place being bums. You are a great person, im glad we got to be good friends. Youve helped me through alot and i thank you for that. I hope everything is well for you..i miss you! <3333

All the people i've met at show and havent had the pleasure of really getting to talk to or hang out with - You people are so nice, seriously i cant even explain how awesome it is that after everything, some of you still take the time to get to know me. I hope i get to be good friends with each of you. 

Kyle - I know we hardly ever talk, but I know your a great person, which is why i try to talk to you as often as i can. Get to know this guy who seems to be so great.  We are going to have so much fun on the 11th. Haha, im gonna talk your head off in the car!! Just you wait!!And im sorry for alot of the things that have been happening.  Thank you for not judging me and actually trying to talk to me. It is very much appericated. <33

who elses..

Oh well poop.

I think everyone in my life is truely amazing, and just because i didnt put you down here doesnt mean that, these are just the people who are major in my day to day lifes right now. 

I love you guys so much. 

Ill write more later."

"event","So last night was just, awesome. After a crappy sunday at work, i wasnt even sure i was gonna go out. But i did. And im so glad i did. I went to Lava and hung out wiht Cooper most of the night(go figure) and for some reason i lost track of time and didnt leave untill it was closed. So i was uber tired and Cooper told me to come stay the night at their place if i was tired, and so did Mikee. So we invited Bigner and Jason(whos car is the most amazing thing ive ever seen by the way mmmm) to come over. We all just sat around and watch some race but i feel asleep untill Cooper woke me up. After that i couldnt go back to sleep, so after Bigner and Jason left and Mikee locked him self in his computer room..for some reason.... me and Cooper sat up till like 6 in the morning having girl talk haha. Its always fun to have girl talk with boy,er,man i mean,that guys amazes me with everything. Its funny how when we first met he was always so quite and now he just talks and talks to me. But its awesome. Cooper is one of the most amazing unique guys ive never met. So last night was great being able to sit and chat withhim all night. Finally i fell asleep at like 6. I woke up at noon and left. Mikee and Cooper let me borrow all their PS2 games. Its sooo awesome. Im never leaving my house because of all the games they let me have haha. I didnt say bye to mikee or cooper when i left because they were both asleep, and those boys sleep alll day. 

So now i have to go to work, hopefully this night will be better.

I have off work Friday - Monday, so anyone want to hang out???  :)

i swear im fun to hang out with. 

I love you guys."

I wasnt going to, but i thought, eh, might as well. So I get to Mandys and we waited for her friends and just chatted it up a bit. Then when we got to the fest it was almost over so we just watched all the drunk people haha. Then we didnt have anything to do so i called Jeff and we were gonna go over there, but i really didnt want to..so i called him and told him i wasnt comming. So instead i went and sat at Mandys with her for like ever having girl talk haha. We both have A.D.D. so every time something happen we would both forget what we were tlkaing about it, so needless to say it too for every to finsh one story haha. But it was nice, i dont really ever get to talk to someone, in person, about my problems. And i love listening to it was nice to talk to her about whats going on in her life. So it ended up being a good night, its good to hang out with Mandy, i need to start getting out more often. 

More people need to start asking me to hang out dammit. 

:)

Also...Jeff reminds me of Telly on Kids hahahaha."

""Will someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That your're deserting for better company?""

Yea anyway. 

Im feeling kind of sad today. Im not sure why. I went shopping and hated it, which is weird because I love to shop. So somethings on my mind. Maybe its the fact that im afriad im gonna leave and not be missed. Or that im not gonna leave and never have the life i think i could. 

Im not sure. Maybe im just feeling alone? Maybe i miss Jeff? Or Maybe its not that i even miss him, i just miss the thought of being with someone.  

Maybe im sad because I feel like all these people who call me their ""friend"" really arent? Maybe its because im sick of sitting at my house. And i just want to hang out, but everyone else has thigns to do, i never have things to do.

What is it what is it.

"event","So i came home from work today, which is awesome because i didnt really feel good.
I've been trying to relax the past  couple of days, its been nice.

Thursday I worked then came home and planned on just sitting in my bed all day because i wasnt feeling good, but i went out to dinner with Mom and my brother instead, then was going to go see a movie with Heidi but she bailed. So I went over to Jeff's. Yea i didnt hear the end of that from my friends. Anyone i talked to on the phone while i was there just kept saying""WHAAAAAT!?"" and asking me if we were talking again and blah blah blah. I was just like, dont worry about it, its nothing. IT was actually kind of funny to hear all my friends say the same thing when they asked me what i was doing and i responded with""im at Jeffs"". But yea we just watched some football, it was such a boring game. So we turned it off and watched Pool Hall Junkies, which is umm one the coolest movies ive seen.  It was nice to just sit around and hang out with Jeff, because thats one thing i miss, is just hanging out with him. He made some Cinnabon pop corn mmmmmmm but i didnt feel good so i only ate a little bit.  but mmmmmm anyway. I left there at lie midnight and came home and chatted on the computer for a minute then went to sleep.

Friday I just went to work then came home and layed on the couch alll day. Finally got up and too a shower and went to run some errands. Yet again i forgot to put my paycheck in the bank, but oh well.  I got a new credit card on friday haha, bad bad me. But oh well.. I went to Best Buy and they had all these DVDs on sell haha. I bought KIDS, Requiem For A Dream, and Kill Bill 2. Then i bought Atmosphere -Overcast and Maroon5-Songs About Jane.  And i must say, its seriously such an awesome CD because when i listen to it i just relax. I think im in love with it. 
I was suppose to go Kyles, but i bailed out. I didnt feel like dealing with people, stupid people at that. This is just starting to get annoying. But oh well. Kind of wish i would of gone but i needed to stay in anyway, i havent been feeling too good lately.  I talked to Mikee last night about me moving. He gave me some silly reason as to why i should stay,like him, and Cooper, and Coopers huge no no. I told him those were good enough haha. Besides him and Cooper, mostly Cooper because im going to marry him.....er..nothing. But Cooper is moving to L.A. at some point anyway,and Mikee i dont get to see that often anyway. But then he told me if he thinks it'll make me happy to go. I mean really, look at my life here, yea i know some great people who make me really happy, but no one ever calls me and wants to hang out, no one ever comes here to see me, i just work and sit at my house most of the time. I hang out with Mom more then anyone else.  Its just starting to wear on me. Its poop.

So today i let someone work for me which is awesome since i feel like poop. Plus Mom and I are going to get a dress for me to wear to a wedding. I have to buy a dress everytime i have to go some place where i have to dress nice because i HATE wearing dresses. I have this huge hips so dresses make them bigger. Then we are gonna go get Carrabbas mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i cant WAIT to eat there. Then maybe tonight ill stop by the TollRoad Festival, anyone want to go with me? Its right by my house :)

Well off to shower.

I love you guys."

So ive been talking about moving to Florida since like July. But well first i met someone so i put it on hold, but he didnt want to stick around, so now i dont need to stick around. So i was all set to move, then hurricanes every where, so now thats why im still here. So basically after all these hurricanes are gone, i'll probably back my stuff and leave unless there is a reason i shouldnt. 

So if anyone could please tell me some good reasons as to why i should or shouldnt good? Please give me some pro's and con's. :) i know in the end it only comes down to me, but sometimes its nice to hear other peoples opinions.

Im sure no one well comment, but its worth a shot. 

I have a lot of negative thoughts in my head so i can only think of reason to leave, and im sure there are some good reason to stay, im just too blind to see them..

I food ran and everyone stood around and did nothing while i ran all their food and did their side work ...all night. But yet no one tipped me out good. Infact one person didnt even tip me out said she would get me back. FUCK that on Sunday when she food runs see if i tip her out.  I was so pissed. I yelled at all of them when i left that they better not expect me to run their shit while they stand around and do nothing next time. And walked out. FUCK them. I almost cried i was so pissed. 
Then i almost got hit by a fire truck, im begging to wonder if that would of been a bad thing or not. 

i want to burn my work down.

So then I come home and all i want to do is just relax. But no, thats too much to ask. Instead i get drama. You know what i dont like drama so enough with this drama. IM DONE. Everyone is acting petty and stupid, none of this is going to matter in 5 months is it? no, so why have this huge thing about it? honestly...Cant we all just be civil with each other, you dont have to like everyone and everyone isnt going to like you, but atleast everyone can be adults and just learn to be CIVIL.

"event","So this weekend wasnt too bad. I got to relax most of it so that was nice. 

Friday- worked all day, then went home and sat around, then went back to work to hang out with everyone. But i didnt stay too late because I had to work early Saturday morning.

Saturday - went to work...work was good, made just what i needed too and i was in a good mood because that night was my tattooo!  I got off work early so i called to see if Fud wanted me to come in earlier, so they told me just to come in at 6:00.  I got there and he told me to come back in a hour, i didnt really care. But Ash had to go some where so i just took her back to Taryns then went back to Blue Byrd. I walk in and they told me that Jeremiah was gonna do it instead. At this point i just didnt care, i was kind of mad because i wanted Fud to do it but whatever i knew Jeremiah had done some of Jeffs and Mandys tattoos so it was cool. Was there for like and hour and half although the actually tattoo only took like 30 minutes. It wasnt too bad for the most part. Jeremiah made me feel comfortable because he kept joking around, so that was nice. Some parts of the tattoo hurt way worse then others. Since i got it scripted, which i let Jeremiah pick out the writing, and its actually really good looking, i love it, im getting my next one in the same writing, but since it was script the outline hurt because it was longer, and when he was filling in the C that really hurt. I dont know why that side hurt so much more then the other, Jeremiah said people are like that. *shrugs* I think it mostly had to do with the area too.  Im pretty  satisfied with out come. Looks good. I'll post a picture some time. After that Mom took me out to eat, but i had to leave because i had such a headache from making squishy faces when i was getting tattooed plus i was sore. So i went home and just laid around. Ive been real wore out lately i dont know why. 

Sunday - Woke up and took a shower and then me and Mom got breakfest(yea i hang out iwth my mom alot so what?) Then i went to go pick up Erik. We got to El Diablosat like 2 30 and no one was there we all just stood around. I was the only girl for a bit,then Rosemary came and she kidnapped me and we went to get smoothies. Got back at like 3 :30 and the door still werent open but a lot more people showed up. So i just mingled. Then finally they opened the doors i dunno even know when like 4? Spent most of the night sitting there with Erik and other random people who would stop and talk to us. Got to see Surcease, which is Byrons band. Got to chat with him for a bit, saw Holly Pollard, which was weird haha, chatted with her for a bit. Tim came later on which was awesome because i love him. And I got to meet Dibbs brother which i didnt know was the singer of Suffocate Faster. Got made fun of by all the boys after that. It was actually pretty funny, even though i was the one getting made fun of...wait that shouldnt be funny. Jerks. Got to see Kyle and just kept telling him how AWESOME he is. I cant wait!! weeee! Met some new people, like Molly, she seems awesome we are in a club. Met some other people too but i dont know if i ever get their names? eh.. All in All was a good day..Went home after and chatted online with random, Jeff called, chatted with him. Then went to bed i was pooped. Sitting at that door all night..woooo that wears you out! Slept good though. 

now its monday, labor day, im sitting at my house, about to go to work..woo hoo. We're gonna be dead its beautiful out everyone is cooking out. Oh well.

Don't you hate when you look back at things that have happened and wish you would of said something but you didnt? This has been bothering me alot lately. I've been finding myself doing this way too often. So this one is to you because its been bothering me. And you know who you are. 

Do you remember the time you asked me if i thought you were hot and i just laughed because i thought it was sillly? Well i wish i would of told you how amazing i really thought you were. Inside and out. 

And the night when i dropped that big news on you that i found out that day? And you asked me why im always smiling and i said because its better then frowning? Really it was because every time i was with you i just smiled because i dunno, you made me smile. 

Also,I loved how you always made me laugh. You truely are a great person. And every time i drove to you place, i got butterflies in my stomach and i dont know why. For some reason i would get so nervous just to go and sit at your house with you. And i still can't figure that out.

And every time i would say stuff to you about you treating me this way or that way. In the end it never matter, and i would forget all about it the next morning untill you would call to say sorry. Which was very sweet of you, but even if you wouldnt of done that i probably wouldnt of bothered with it because for some reason i would always just forget. But i think you had to understand that im very protective of myself. I just think that was my way of seeing if you really cared or were just playing games. Ya know i honestly dont know why i did that because its not like me at all. 


There is alot of things i didnt ever say that now i wish i could. As much i want to be mad right now and just think of bad things. I find my mind full of only the good stuff. And no matter what i care for you so much as a person. And i will be there for you ever need anything. Dont ever hesitate to ask. I wish it never would of turned out this way. I wanted us to in the long run atleast be friends. Who knows now. It's funny, I wanted you to go away so i could take the time to forget about you, and now i cant even talk to you because i dont even know what is going on anymore. 

I hope all is well. 

I do miss you.

""people come and go in our lives almost in rotation, even though some people rotate out, there's always another who comes into your life at the right time, when you need them most. when you've outgrown a person, no matter how hard it is, or how much it hurts, there will eventually be another to take their place. not take their place in your heart or memories, but to fill the void. it's hard to let go of something you are used to, and they become like a bad habit, that just keeps getting harder to break. but eventually there'll be an epiphany, and we all BREAK FREE! ""

"event","So i hung out with Mom tonight. We went out to eat at my work and then to Target. I told her about my whole, how i feel on the inside but how i think being two different things situation. And how i dont understand how i can feel so hurt by him, but yet care so much about him. And how its been messing up my whole life lately. And she basically told me that sometimes you can't help how you feel on the insides, and that more often then not your mind is usually wrong and you should follow your heart. She also said that maybe in long run we'll meet again and be friends. And that people come into your life for a reason, that every single person who walks into your life, never leaves without leaving you with something learned, or something gained. And that maybe he came into my life to show me something and i havent figure it out yet. Or that maybe he came to help me learn something, or so i can avoid certain things in the future because of this. And how she has never hated anyone shes ever dated, no matter how much they hurt her, because it takes too much time to actually hate someone, when you can just not let them hurt you like they have before, and just let them go. And even if your still friends with them that you know you arent letting them hurt you like they did. Same goes with anyone you have relationships with, boys,girls,lovers,friends.  Which is true, why take the time to hate a person when you can just let it go and make sure you never let someone hurt you like that again, or that person. She made me feel a little bit better, although the only converstation almost made me cry. 

Im just real hurt by this whole situation. In the end i want to know that we could be friends, because i did care alot about him, I just needed time to get the feelings that i had for him out, and then know that if i ever needed anything i could go to him, and he could come to me for anything.  I just needed time. And now this, now he hates me, and im not even sure what i think of him, i dont like him at all right now, but yet if he would come to me and need something, i would be there for him, and if i dont like someone i wouldnt do that for them. Which doesnt make sense.  I just need to get away from this place, i need more distractions. I need something to get this all off my mind. bleh

I've just been real confused lately about my life. The things i do, the people i see. Im not sure what i want to do anymore, or who i want to hang around. Im not sure about  much of anything.  Im just sick of always been at home, im sick of ohio and really sick of dayton. 

I just want all of this to go away and stop being on my mind."

"event","It amazes me how a persons head, and a person heart, and feel two different things. Like when you mind thinks about all the things wrong with a person, and your heart feels hurt but deep down you know you still care. It's like no matter how many times i tell my self i hate them for what their doing to me, I cant help but care about them.  Its like love and hate go hand and hand sometimes, like your cant truely love a person untill you have hated them. Or something. And I think now more then ever im seeing how much your heart and your head can feel two different things, like when people say to listen to what your heart tells you, i always thought that was kind of silly, because how can it be any different then what you think? But it can. Your mind can think all kinds of hate, while your heart thinks all kinds of love. *sigh* Sometimes i just wish life could be more simple. Maybe even more black and white. So it would make more sense. 
My heart is hurting right now, and i know why and i hate them for it, but through it all..I'll still tell others what a good person they truely are. And soon enough my mind will not hate, because i cant hate. Its rare I hate anyone. It just takes time to get over things...right now it seems this time its taking too long. 

Im not sure whats going on with me right now. I can feel soo happy but yet so empty at the same time. 


le sigh


i love you all"

"event","So today was good. Got to sleep in, which always rocks, then went with Taryn to get her paycheck then to Hoagies. And Hoagies always makes the day better. Hoagies is by far the best pizza ever and i dont know how people havent ever heard or ate there? But we took Crystal and we took her Hoagies virginity and she LOVED it. Like always.  So then i came home and took a shower and it was off to Cincy! I drove alllll the way to Beechmont to hang out with Lauren, and then her Tom and I went to see my dearest cooper. He just had back surgery poor guy. It was nice to see him, although he was all drugged up and out of it. But anyone who knows me knows me, really knows me, know that nothing could change that every time i see him its always the best feeling ever. I would marry that boy if he ever asked me. Even if he is so much older then me, it doesnt change anything. So we left so Lauren and Tom could eat. I didnt want to eat so i just came home. I was suppose to hang out with Rick but i didnt feel like doing much i was getting tired. Plus i have to work the morning so its best i came home. But anyway, tonight and today turned out to be a good day, it nice to just be out and having fun not sitting in my house or being in dayton at that. 

:)

I love you guys."

"event","Also, i keep thinking about him. I dont know why. I think its starting to set it that im alone, I keep thinking about being with him. And i think i even miss him, i dont want to fucking miss him. But i think i do. I just want to hug someone and be loved. Why is that so hard for me to have? And even when i think about me dating someone new,thoughts of him come back into my head...I dont even have feelings for him anymore..nothing, not even a friendly feeling...so why the fuck am i thinking of him!  This doesnt make any sense to me. I cant even figure out my own head on this. I just wish i would of never let myself get attached, because now im screwed. My mind is such a clusterfuck this doesnt make it better. I just want him out of my head, i want him gone. I want to forget everything. I want to not even know him anymore. And thats alot for me to say because I take everyone that comes into my life like it was ment and i dont regret anything or anyone in mylife. But this is something i think i wish wouldnt of happen. He has completely turned me upside down, and played games with my head that now im all screwy. All this time i was so sure of men and what they wanted from me, and how they worked. And now i dont even know. I couldnt ever figure this man out. And now im blank.  Im so confused about everything. I dont know why i let him infect my life..All the times i told myself not to get close..but i did. Maybe this is all for the better and I'll figure this out. But right now i hate him and wish i wouldnt of EVER let him into my life  the way i did. Because im all mixed up and its driving me crazy.

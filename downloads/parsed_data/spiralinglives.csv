  My journal is basically 'Friends Only' for several reasons. One, because most of my friends' journals are and I want them to have that privacy. Secondly, because I've seen some of the problems with having a public journal. Soooooo, if you want to friend me, tell me a little about yourself. I also don't post a lot...either in my journal or anyone else's...not because I'm not interested, but because I'm basically lazy. LOL  So please don't get offended if I don't.
  The same rules apply here as on everyone's journal...no hotlinking, and if you use something from a friend's journal, ask first and give credit. They really put a lot of effort into their sites, and deserve the credit."

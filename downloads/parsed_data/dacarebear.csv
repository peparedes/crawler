"event","<p align=left>my birthdays tomorrow. not excited all of a sudden, in fact i'm feeling really depressed, the same way i felt last year and the year before. i don't know why, other than the fact that everyone forgets my birthday... every year... I just want one person to remember and suprise me and be thankful that i was born... that probably came off as being conceited and stuff, but look at it through my point of view. I have low self-esteem and a fluctuating mood I have no control over... o yea plus I'm extremely sensitive and have emotions that tend to go on overdrive... You <i>think</i> I can contol but that my friend you are mistaken. Now I sign off and go sing happy birthday to my self as i cry myself to sleep. 

<p align=center><i>Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me-e
Happy birthday to me...</i>

I'm trying to catch up on all the movies I never saw. My mom got me unlimited movies for a month so im going to see as many as I can. Its been awesome having rick home, but he leaves thursday morning:( The good thing about that is I won't have anymore bite marks on me... I guess he won't either;) We are a violent pair... Joe, ricks brother always finds us in contorted posistions (joe calls it weird kamasutra) where we are laughing, slapping, hitting, and notoriously biting each other. good times, good times. Im going to miss that, so if I come up and bite you, im sorry but i cannot help it. I bite. I'm teething, and unfortunatly it is going to last a long time. I always have to have something in my mouth ( eww and not in that way sicko) right now it is my lip, which might i have is bleeding b/c i keep biting and sucking on it... ooooooooops. my bad. anyway, im bored. i'll update sooon. oh yeah, i have my senior pix tomorrow... they are going to be horrible. my school pix always are. whens brittany going to be back?!?!

"event","So I'm back...5 days later. My cousin, Tripp, is 4 weeks old, and is the most precious thing I've ever seen. He truly is, I'm not even saying that because he's my cousin. I babysat him a lot which was fun. I nicknamed him Squirt b/c he does that a lot... u feed him, u birp him then...SQUIRT... he spits up... kinda funny actually. any way... where my uncle lives is in the Martin Luther King District... an almost all black neighborhood in which 4 houses down from theirs is a crack house and a few blocks away is the red light district (for those of u who don't know what that is... its where all the black prostitute or ""dem hoes"" stand waiting for a customer...) I found the most awesome store on the face of the planet. It is my Mecca. Its called Loose Lucy's, its a hippie shop with really awesome clothes. I got a bunch of stuff. My Uncle is the announcer for the Charleston River Dog, a minor league baseball team with a lot of hot guys that are relatively younge. At one of the games I picked out my favorite players (hehehe) which were numbers 7,8, and 9. The next day at the game number 8 was up in the booth where my Uncle was sitting before the game getting his stuff in order and number 8 goes to my uncle and I quote says ""Who was that hot little thing with that lady you were talking to last night"" when my unlce told me that i was like ""YOU BLEW IT!"" this kid was only 18 and worth a couple million... damn... o well... im over it. My mom and I were talking about my horrible comp cards (for modeling) that are now like 3 or 4 years old with my aunt... a friend of hers is a model. my aunt took one of my cards to her and her friend wants to take my card with her when she moves to atlanta, ga and give it to her agency which does work in charleston, sc, atlanta, ga, and all over california! i'm so excited! Cari's going nation wide! on the way home today my mom and i stopped at an outlet mall. we went to the ""music 4 less"" store and i finally got the new hanson cd... which might i add is quite good... and i got an older one for 4.99... awesomeness... ok... thats all for now."

I eventually found my ddr cd and so we hooked up our (adam and I's) ddr (dance dance revolution) mats. it was soooooo funny. camille is so cute! she looks like a lil raptor when she dances... her dances look like a combination between an irish jig and a disco. her right arm always springs up into the air... don't worry we have it on tape. im so exhausted from all the dancing. Adam - i kicked your ass and u know it!! anyway... i had an awesome time and were doing it again some time before i leave for costa rica (billy its Coh-sta Rica not Cost-a Rica!) Rick called, he was being all pissy... grrr... so i told him i'd call him 2morrow b/c he was puting me in a bad rude and that i was being rude to the people who were at my house, that made him a lil pissier. argh.

Anyway, it's been a pretty cool week (if u subtract the school part which in its entirety keeps draging on and on and on and on) I hung out Jimmy most of the weekend and someday during the week. We went to Starbucks which was yummy. Tomorrow (friday... thank God...) after Jimmy gets off work we are gonna watch/rent a movie. hooray for movies... I haven't seen very many if I really think about it... It's sorta sad and pathetic. I live in a place where there is a place like blockbusters on every corner practically (at least a place where i can get somekind of mooovie) and a tv with God knows how many movie channels and I never watch any movies... it's probably because I'm <i>always<i/> sleeping. 
I love the guitar. I wrote a complete song for <i>The Impatients<i/> and it totally rocks for a first band-made-song if that makes any sense... anyway... i took a quiz on how Jewish are you... my non jewish friend got an 80% where as I, the Jew, got a 55%...

"event","I <3 RICK! It's been a week of hell in our relationship, but after a lot of contemplation, we are still together. I feel it is the right choice. I tried to figure out what is best for me, and whats best for me is to be with him even though I haven't seen him in 5 months... I'm getting tired of people asking me why I'm still with him. And here's my answer ""because I love him and things like that just don't matter. it's when I see him that make things worth living for."" 
Wiz is over...thank God...It was a lot of fun though. I love Mrs. Ruben, she is so funny and makes me happy even though she yells... a lot. lol. Set strike was exhausting... I we were all at school for 13 long ass hours on a SATURDAY! Well, thanks to the wiz of oz, I know have all my leadership community service hours done! woohoo!
I got a new CD today, the new Lost Prophet cd... which is really good actually... So yay for that! Um... yea... it's been a crappy week but everything is a lot better now. so thats good. things aren't perfect, but i'm used to that... i'm gonna go... but i'll try to write again soon.

"event","don't know where i left off but i'll start off with Rick and I... next week is our 11 month anniversary... I <3 Rick. Well, my brother got married 2 days ago. thats a funny story. Friday was the bride's maid luncheon, so I a bride's maid went. there was free food and what not yada yada yada... later that day was the wedding rehersal... afterwards was the rehersal dinner, this is where the ""fun"" began. I knew exactly what i was gonna eat... I tried it a month ago and had my heart set on it. I ate it and it was incredibly good. I had a house salad, salmon in pastry, and creme brulee for dessert.  I knew I ate too much, I always eat waaaaaay too much. I had a tummy ache:( I told my mommy. By the time we got back to the hotel it was between 11 and 11:30... I went right to bed because I wasn't feeling good. I woke up at a little after 6 and started puking my insides out. Keep in mind this is now the day of the wedding. I called my mom and said ""mom... i'm throwing up"" well she came and brought me 7-up... big mistake... i threw that right up. It was to the point that I had nothing left in my stomach to throw up. I finally had to go get my hair done at 8:45... I felt like CRAP. So... I got my hair done, it was a combo of a Miss Texas pagent winner and some one from the 50s or 60s.... so we left the hair place 
(with my hair that had enough hair spray to be declared a bomb shelter by the gov) we went to Kathleen's house (my now sister-in-law) and got ready... I was weak and shaky.we were getting ready to take a picture when all of a sudden i was like ""I gotta go..."" I ran to the bathroom where i started throwing up... in the toilet and on my bride's maid dress... perfect, 2 hours before the wedding. luckily it dried... and I made it to the wedding. I have no idea how i made it through the wedding without throwing up or passing out. About 5 minutes before the ceremony was over I broke out into a cold sweat and almost ran out of the church to throw up. Luckily I didn't and made it. My Aunt and her bf, went to get me gatorade and some medicine... which 20 minutes later during the wedding party pictures at the river park I threw up all over my shoes and dress. Luckily my grandma had followed me there just incase something had happened and I needed to go back to the hotel. I laid in bed (except for when I had to throw up) for the next 18 hours... I missed the wedding reception and the wedding brunch the next day. that sucked... I missed the brunch because I was rushed to the emergency room. It was the first time I had ever really gone to the hospital. I was there for several hours. I don't really remember what happened... I got there and they hooked me up to an IV and drew some blood out of my other arm, then I moved to a room right next to it. I was sooo cold I was shaking... they put me in heated blankets but I was so cold they had to put newly heated blankets on me. after the first IV was done they put the anti nausia med in... then put a second iv in... shortly after they put more anti-nausia med in... it wasn't more than 5 minutes later when I started shaking I was so cold, it was to the point I was convulsing... I don't remember what happened after that. i only remember my dad coming and my mom going (switching shifts for the wedding brunch) and the nurse rushing to find something to relax me... thats all i remember... the next thing i knew my dad was asking me some questions of somesort and making me drink gatorade... i was having trouble drinking it... thats when i truely went blank... the next thing I knew I woke up in the car in the garage and someone was helping me to my bed where i slept from 5 or 6pm to 9 the next morning (today) I couldn't go to school today and I'm still really dizzy from all the medicine they gave me at the hospital. I can drink now where as for the past 2 days i couldn't keep anything down. I ate my first solid meal today (a pop tart) i was sooooo hungry. I hadn't had anything to eat since friday night. well... thats about it. hope everyone is better than I am."

I folded probably around 500 letters, completed probably around the same number. The funny thing is, there is a total of around 2500 letters that need to be sent. But the cool thing is, I'm getting paid, i get to use a cool folding paper machine, and cool stampers, and i get my own office area/ conference room:) I feel special.

Good music is hard to come by these days.
In a world filled with synthetic devices and evil marketing people, true music is dying. Music in the 60s and 70s was music. The 60s and the 70s was a time of music and drugs. Whether the music led to the drugs or the drugs led to the music, it doesn't matter at this moment, true music is leaving. Well thats what I think at any rate. I'm not condoning drug use for music.

I was so upset about him not calling on valentine's day, that was the one day I expected to hear from him. He said ""you know I love you, right?"" which then led to me saying ""sometimes, I just don't know,Rick."" He doesn't always show he cares about me and that he loves me. But deep down I know he does when he acts the way he sometimes acts. I got an e-mail from him that almost made me cry. He appologized and I understood. He said the sweetest things.

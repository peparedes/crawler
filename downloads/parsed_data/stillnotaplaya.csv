I don't really know what to write here anymore, maybe i'll start doing it again since a couple of my buddies left that use this *cough* Kyle/Mailman *cough*
Anyway, Craig is now my hero for meeting Ron Jeremy
oh yeah, if you notice that i have deleted you off of my friends list now or in the near future, it's because of these 3 reasons
1) I don't care what you did, or what you have to say
2) I don't know you, so I don't care what you have to say
3) You talk too much, so undoubtedly, I don't care what you have to say

i'm fatherless
i'm lonely
all my friends are gone or are leaving in months
i'm crying
fuck you all
I hate everyone
-thanks for calling me and telling me you weren't coming to my house tonight, we only waited for like an hour to see what movie you were bringing, then we finally put Fast and the Furious on, everyone left like half an hour into it, Daredevil arrived after they left. I waited until 12:30 figuring you might take her home then come back and watch it, but you didn't. The movie sucked ass anyway, or maybe i just wasn't in the mood.
-your best friend for like years is gone away for 3 months, is back for only 2 days, and you skip out on him, your a homo, and if a certain someone is making you that way, well maybe you should fucking open your eyes.
-one of my good friends told me she was coming to see me from Ontario last weekend, probably the time i needed her most, she called me when she arrived at the airport, she stayed like a week, she may even still be here, think i've heard from her once......nope
-i spent a full year wasting my time with a chick, she gets cheated on by her ex-b/f like 2-3 weeks ago, i spend 2 full days w/ her consoling her. I find out like 3 days later she's back with the guy she told me she hated and wanted to die while crying for like 2 days straight. Then to top it off, she super promised she was gonna call me, yeah, she never called
so honestly fuck you all
who needs friends when you got enemies like this
i'm spending the next couple days at my house, alone, i'll leave for work, don't fucking call, i don't want to talk to you
i complain too much, i'm a hypocrit, a waste of flesh
yeah, this is the gay shit that people put in there fucking journal
reply to this if you bothered reading it, and tell me how gay i am, or how much of a fucking loser i am.
and then honestly, someone sucker punch me when they see me next, i want to beat the living shit out of someone, try me, see how tough i really am
I'm 20, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin, if reproducing in the only reason i'm here, then i guess i shouldn't be here

okay i've seen 3 movies in the past two days
About Schmidt - 4.5 Stars
Basic - 3 Stars
T3 Rise of Machines - 3.5 Stars
All really good movies, T3 was surprisingly amazing. Basic was really really good, it always had you thinking. About Schmidt is life changing, the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is cause it was a little slow at times.
Doug's Rating Style:
5 stars - movie is fucking amazing, go out and buy it/rent it/see it on the big screen, whatever you do see this movie.
4.5 Stars - same as 5 stars only don't be in such a hurry
4 Stars - Worth buying even if you don't collect movies, and defenitely worth seeing. Pretty much a must see sometime.
3.5 Stars - Worth buying if you have a movie collection or are a movie buff, defenitely plan to see it in the future.
3 Stars - Okay, well maybe if you have a movie collection, and one of your favorite actors is in it, then you buy it. A movie most people should see
2.5 Stars - Go rent it, buying may be a bit sketchy, if it looks like a movie you don't usually like, then don't rent it unless there's nothing else better there
2 Stars - Only rent this movie if it's your type of movie deal
1.5 stars - something was horribly wrong in this, but maybe there was a good actor or something in it
1-0 Stars - Don't ever watch this movie, ever......
I've seen a lot of movies, and i mean a lot, so if you ever wondering about a flick, i've probably seen it. Feel free to ask.
I can't believe i rambled on this long, i'm going the fuck to bed before the sun comes up and i can't get to sleep"

"event","so last night i decided i was going to drink for the first time in a long time. I headed over to Mailman's w/ my 24 beer. well actually it was down to 20 by that time. So I started drinking, and toking. By my 12th or 13th beer, and my 4th joint, i arrived at the bar. It was slow at first, but then things picked up. I saw the girl that i was hopelessly in love with for over a year that fucked with my head big time at the bar, and shot her down, not once, not twice, but 4 times (she's super poison) i was pretty proud of myself after that. Though I realized that all my friends that were supposed to be at the bar, were gone by 1, and the bar doesn't close until 2, so i got in a pissy mood, it wasn't there fault i guess, the 3 main people i wanted to see at the bar, one was sick, one got like sun stroke that day and the other stayed until almost 1. But it was cool i chilled w/ other people i knew until i headed to Mailmans. I told Mailman and Cindy to leave the door unlocked, which they did, but Matt and Kristy arrived after they went to bed, and before i got back and locked the door, so me being drunk, knocked on the door for like 30 minutes and rung the doorbell. Then finally, I was like fuck this and went and started hammering on there bedroom window. They unlocked the door, I came in checked the fridge, 3 beer left, i was like sweet, drank another beer watched some tv and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning, with no hangover. Went home, then went to town, chilled w/ Mike from like 4-7, went out to Lindsays and swam in her pool for a while, once everyone left there was just Lindsay, Helen, Johnny and me left, so the girls tried to be teases. Me being 20(and been through the stage of being teased over and over again already) and them being 17 or 18 both w/ Boyfriends, I just ignored them, which i think kinda pissed them off cause they started getting more and more frisky. hahaha So anyway, i got back to town, and remember the girl i asked out like 2 weeks ago and she told me she wasn't ready for another relationship, and i told everyone she was full of shit, but no one believed me, well i saw her and her new boyfriend together. and the funny thing is, it didn't fuzz me a bit, i actually laughed at it. the new boyfriend is an old old friend of mine, and i know he'll treat her right, and she's a nice girl, so i'm happy for them. I doubt he knew i asked her 2 weeks ago and to give her credit, it was too early for me to ask. So anyway on the way home I had to do super evasive driving to miss a racoon, which puts me up to like 50 animals in the past month i've seen on the road, this was the closest call by far tho. Oh ya and Brand New where do they come in this. Well i bought the CD Your Favorite Weapon off of Mailman today, and i've listened to it like 3 or 4 times already. It rocks!!!! Soco Amaretto Limo is probably my fav off of it. Followed by Mix Tape and Jude Law something something. 
Anyway this is long enough, peace!
PS. Hey sexy ladies, i'm available, have all my teeth and can count to 100! hahahaha"

"event","Well I haven't update this the past couple of days, why, cause well the past couple days have been a haze, a purple haze to be exact, me and Mike have been celebrating me getting back into uni quite a bit this week. Maybe too much. Anyway, i've been working, or chilling, or gettin stoned w/ Mike the past week so there isn't too much to talk about. 
Tonight on the other hand, I went and saw the Action Set rock the ceildh's roof. Chad tripping over his amp falling on the face and keep rocking out made my night/week.......and then me and Matt (defenitely a cool customer) went and saw an Asian FUCKING Midget!!!! We were perfect actors when we ran past him and looked for Puff the Magic Dragon hat. Anyway, I can't wait to see the next action set show.
I met up w/ a few people I've talked to on icq/msn or LJ, let's see if i can remember all the new people that i had a conversation with. Let's see I talked to Chad, Matt, Jill and Crystal. Who all seem really cool, i met some other people but didn't get a chance to really talk to them. I got to meet some people that I haven't seen in a while, aka, Jeremy and Robyn (Seese ima gonna kick your ass!) which was totally sweet, of course I forgot Donnie Darko.
I bought a couple of DVD's, I bought the original kings of comedy, already seen it, but it's effing hilarious, and Beware of the Blob, the sequel to The Blob, I just finished watch the blob and it saddens me how much people have desensitized (sp?) in the past 31 years. People got scared shitless from a fake red thing absorbing people and a lot of screaming. Nowadays mofo villian's gotta look scary, have scary talents, talk scarey, walk scarey, own scarey shit and have scarey weapons. Villians got a hard life nowadays.
Anyway I hope I see those people again in the near future. and i hope to see the Action Set in the really near future.
I heart Chad
Jeremy smells..........really good
Matt you and me will search for the elusive albino midget right after Chad shows us where the gnomes live (I hear they hang out a lot cause the midget is the only person who can fit in there ""home"" and doesn't like the light btw its gotta be a cave of some sort)
Action Set rock can't wait for another concert
Waiting in Anticipation for Kyle's return so i can hear a New Romance rock it out once again.
oh ya Mailman if you still read this, Everest is a hill, and only a hill, don't let anyone else tell you differently, hahahaha

"event","So Prom was a rocking good time, My date looked hot as hell, but hey that's a given.....right guys?? We went to one of her friends places for pictures, then to another place for more pictures, then to another place for dinner and more effing pictures. So anyhow, after all that shit was done, we went to another friends place for a pre-party, I kept it on the low down and only had a beer. (If i ruined someone elses prom by getting caught drinking, i'd never forgive myself) So anyway we got to prom, they actually played good dancing music at the prom, good mix of hip-hop, rock, slow songs, but they had a little too much raver-type music for my liking. At my prom we had a shitty band, whoo! If it was a good band that woulda rocked, but it was shitty. I think a DJ is better for prom cause you get a larger variety of music, everyone gets a taste of what they like, and i like almost everything so i win no matter what! My date hates dancing, but we got out for all the slow songs, and she even asked me once for a hip-hop song, don't worry i got her out for lots of dances, wither she liked it or not! Me and another girl (old news type) got out on the dance floor, we were usually pretty good dancers at the bars but at prom we clicked, I guarantee there were no better at the prom, we did some shit that you would think we rehearsed or some shit. So anyway, we leave the prom like 15 minutes before it ends, and i find out that my best friend from like age 7-14 did a micheal jackson skit during the song Billie Jean (which was playing as we left) and he's done them before and i hear he's really good at them and i missed yet another one. All cause my dates, friends date who is a effing idiot, he wanted to leave after like an hour just so he could go drink, and he was getting mad cause he wanted to drink before hand, but it was his own dumb fault that he locked the keys in his car, so i had to drive him to his house, then back out to Pomquet, then back to St. Andrews, i was ready to fucking choke the guy by the end of the night. Anyway enough bickering, so we go out to prom party at one of my friends house, it was just a small one with our close friends. We get to drinking, and for some really weird reason, before I was drinking, i just knew i had to ask my prom date out, So anyway, after a little bit, I finally got a hold of her away from her female friends and asked her out, well she told me the same thing the past 3 girls i've asked out, i'm not ready for another relationship....Crash and Burn!!!! But i've gotten used to it, at least now i can say i tried. Hey maybe this one actually isn't ready for a relationship and isn't gonna go start dating someone else a week later.....hahaha who am i kidding. So then the drinking began! I drank a pint in 3 drinks and then people kept on giving me drinks of rum, i was double fisting rum and cokes from like 2 until 4, that when i hit the beer. i don't know how much i ended up having. My count at the end of the night was 8 beer and probably a quart or more of rum, but i think someone may have stolen a few out of the cooler. Just as the sun was about to come up, I hoped in my friends jeep and we hotboxed the jeep. I was so fucked by that time, I can't believe I remember the whole night. After the jeep, i just decide, hey it's like 5-6 in the morning, i never ate anything yesterday, i'm pretty drunk/stoned, i'm going the fuck to sleep, so I did, i fell asleep in my car, woke up around 11-12, Got my keys from the parents, drove home. Went back to bed and woke up around 4. Went to town last night, I know this is gonna sound redneckish, but i'm a bit redneckish. We had a smokeshow, (burnout competition w/ cars, only there's no real competition, it's just for shits and giggles) It was awesome, I saw my prom date there for like a minute, but never got a chance to talk to her. Anyway if you like motorcycles watch Biker Boys, I was surprised, it was actually half decent acting in it. Anyway peace"

Doctor gives me this stuff and tells me don't take this before you drive, cause it makes you very very sleepy and will put you too sleep. So anyway last night I take one at 1 AM cause i wasn't tired, 3 AM rolls around, still not tired, take another one, still doesn't affect me, so I just laid in bed and dozed off eventually. Anyway last night I went to the Italian job with Mailman, Cindy and Cindy (sounds like Newhart, this is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl) I give it 3.5 stars, which is pretty high in my books cause i may have seen like 5-10 5 star movies in my life and i've seen a lot of movies. So anyway today has pretty muched sucked hardcore, I went to work at 9, and for some reason I got all depressed about not having a lot of my friends around. It was a first for me, i've missed my friends before, but i've never really gotten depressed about it. Maybe next week i'll road trip up to Hali to see Jeremy and he can introduce me to the rest of the band, it'll sorta be like hanging out w/ A New Romance, only it'll be hanging out w/ The Action Set or maybe i'll take Robyn up on her offer and go visit Bridgewater for the day. I miss all the small things we used to do together. The stupid conversations like Barold. Touring down the strip cranking tunes, Doing stupid shit like falling down in public places, Even the ""fist fights"" me and Kyle used to have. I wish i had Kyle's computer so i could watch that again, hahaha, if he still has it. I miss watching the guys jam, and just chillin at Kyle's watchin Sportsdesk. We had a lot of good times this year, do we still get to complain about Brenda even though we won't be below her anymore?? At least I won't have to shovel your driveway, but i won't be able to try and get stuck in it anymore either :( Anyhow, i think i'm gonna go play some xbox, haven't done that in forever, peace out"

"event","Today, well technically yesterday, was the best day of my life in a while. First of all I got the CD player put into the car so for like the first time in 2 months i got to listen to Dashboard, Taking Back Sunday, Refused, Boy Sets Fire, Jealous Sound, etc. etc. etc. It got me super pumped up, i'm sure if anyone saw me driving from work they woulda thought i was crazy cause i was like singing at the top of my lungs to the songs i knew the lyrics too, especially Cut from the team by Taking Back Sunday (why you ask, cause me, Kyle, Matt, Dave and possibly Mailman drove done the tour singing that as loud as we could one day during like rush hour) Anyway the music got me into a really good and hyper mood which is prolly why this is gonna be so long. Anyway once i got home i called Cindy, chatted w/ her for a bit and asked her to the movies tommorow night well technically tonight (haha isn't that annoying) and she said yes, yay for that. I think i might ask Mailman and his Cindy to come with. I wanna see the Italian Job. Then I went to work and made like almost 100 bucks so that's awesome too. Which reminds me, if anyone thinks the wildlife is diminishing, come for a drive w/ me sometime. In the past week i've seen 6 deer, 1 bear, 1 skunk, 1 racoon and 1 porcupine all alive on the road. That's including 3 cats, 1 deer and a 1 racoon today alone. There getting way too tame to, the deer i saw today i slowed right down and started like ""crawling"" towards it in the car and i got within like 5 feet before it took off. The 2nd cat i saw today was just sitting on the yellow line, i didn't know what it was so i backed up and i noticed it had fur, and it was still there so i thought it was dead, but then it looked at me and i realized it was a cat. I pulled up beside it and it still didn't take off til I opened the door and told it to shoo (I didn't want kitty to get hit by the next vehicle coming the other way) Anyway this is way too fucking long so i'm out, peace"

I dunno if anything is going to become of us, it's waaaaaaaaaaaay to early to tell, but it'll be nice even if we only become just better friends. anything else is just a bonus. I'm gonna call Kev soon in Edmonton, if I knew Dave and Kyle's # i'd probably give them a call tonight too. But I don't so they lose! Today was uber boring, I watched Racing and Golf, and then i went into town and played some pool at Chris' house, I got worked, but his cues and his table is a little fucked and he knows how to play it, a couple games were close. But i think he ended up winning all of them. Stupid table the ball curves if it's going really slow so precision shots are hard to do. Anyhow, enough rambling on for me. Peace!"

"event","Hey everyone, i'm decently stoned and really tired so this could be super short and i could ramble on forever, either way it's prolly not gonna make much sense. I woke up super tired, but went to work anyway, worked for 11 hours, including travel, which puts my sunday-friday total to 50, tommorow is my day off. Anyway i got home and was debating sleep or a movie, so i went and watched Ben-Hur, really good movie, not a big fan of Charlton Heston but he was really good in the movie, it was amazing quality for an 1959 movie, the movie was super ass long, so i watched like 30 minutes of golf or something, then went to bed until like 7:30, i then went to town, hung out w/ the crew at webb's for a bit, went to Cheryl's to pick up mike, went to pool w/ Gavin, Sean, Mike, Chris and Caroline, owned the table, then went w/ Gavin, Sean and Mike and got pretty stoned. We drove around a bit, then I came home and wrote this shit. Anyhow this is getting too long, Peace, Oh ya another frickin deer jumped out in front of me and i cheated, i had a few of Mike's smokes tonight. PS the title means i feel like a zombie"

"event","Well I just got home from town and well it's about 100 fuckin degrees in here, my Dad loves having the heat cranked. While i was in town I hung out w/ some of my friends at Webb's, found out that I may be going to the prom which is gonna rule. Also while i was at Mailman and Matts place i heard some Refused songs, there a band I haven't really sat and listened too but now i think i may have too. Also i've decided that im going to quit smoking, so even when i have nothing to write in this thing i can log on and write about how that's going, I've got one more in the pack and that's for the drive to work, wish me luck! Well I gotta get up for work tommorow at 7, which sucks so i'm gonna head er out
peace"

"event","Well my boss called and woke me up at 12, just to tell me I have to go to work at 4, and she wanted my work information from yesterday, and since she woke me up, I stuck her for an extra 2 hours and managed to pull out a 20 hour day. Yesterday I saw more wildlife on the road then i usually do in a week or a month. On the way to Lismore a frickin bear ran out in front of me, first time for everything I guess. Then on the way back to Cribbon's a deer jumped out in front of me, then again on the way to Cribbon's another frickin deer crossed the road in front of me. Then when I had to take the trash out a pig drove by....hahaha. Anyway i'm just chatting it up w/ the Mailman talking about the bed situation. And this entry is way to fucking long so peace."

"event","Well what to say for my first entry, I guess i'll start off by explaining my livejournal name. It's Still Not A Playa, which is a song by Big Pun, I got bored of putting in emo song title names and getting rejected over and over again. It's my favorite hip-hop song at the moment, and will probably be for a while. I'm not exactly sure what to put into this at the moment, but i'm sure i'll get better with time. Well I worked a whooping 18 hours today, well that includes travel and shit so i'm pretty burnt out, i'll probably sleep until like 2 tommorow afternoon and then I gotta run a bed into Mailman's apt. I guess the single bed I lent him isn't big enough for two people, but hell I hate sleeping in a single bed myself, can't stretch all the way out. Anyway that's all i'm puttin in this for now, i'll be adding shit as shit goes down."

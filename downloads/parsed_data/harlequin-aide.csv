"event","I got an e-mail from Shelley today offering to help me pay for a ticket to go home for Christmas.  I thought that was just about the nicest thing ever. She totally got the fact that I only got the new car because 1. a car is a necessity and 2.it was a good deal and 3. I had no savings to go out and even buy a junker and had to go the financing route.  So no guilt trip about the car, just a really sweet offer to help.  Maybe we will beat that whole dysfunctional family wrap after all.  Now if she can work any magic with mom and get her to pony up and offer to help, I will be forced to build an alter to Shelley and worship her as the deity she is - because getting mom to help out would be a divine miracle."

"event","So today was the first day at the new job. I have been relegated to the role of glorified errand girl until they can get me into an ""official"" training program.  It's not like this is rocket science or anything (although I do have a very slight understanding of the subject thanks to a former flame, but that is a whole other topic really).   I spent most of my shift being a good little helper and sitting in consultations watching others work.  There is a nice friendly warm vibe there at least.  I like the supportive, happy environment.    I will like the job better when I am fully trained and can start seeing clients, because then I get paid on commission and I would prefer to make more $$$

So yesterday the guy and I went to the auto mall because my lease on the Saturn Barbie car is set to expire Oct. 9.  Regardless of the money and the job situation, I had to deal with the car issue  - I mean I considered avoiding it but the reality that they would find me and take the car back seemed rather sucky .  We went to find out how much payments would be if I arranged to buy the car after the lease ends.  Turns out I was gonna get fucked big time in that deal, the pre determined price was 10690 to buy it.  But if I brought it in for trade anywhere in the next year I wasn't gonna get anymore than 7500 tops.  That damn retail wholesale thing always confuses me but it seems like such a racket with cars. And the payments were still gonna be like 300-ish.  So then the guy tells me I can get a brand spankin new 2003 Saturn VUE (that is the cute lil SUV) for less than what I was paying per month on the car, with 0% interest and no payments for 60 days.  And first I thought the sales/finance dude was just full of crap, but we grilled him with every question my guy and I could come up with (that's a lot between the 2 of us) and it still seemed as if the car man was being straight with us and not trying to pull a fast one. Now I only brought my guy with me to make sure I didn't make any hurried irrational decisions, because I <i>would</i> buy a car without thinking it through, I <i>have</i> done it before.  But after a test drive and a short amount of paperwork, neither of us could come up with a good reason for me not to get the new ride. So I left the lot with a new vehicle and waved goodbye to the Barbie car.  And the kicker is that I <i>wanted</i> to get a VUE but thought with the new job and stuff there was no way I could get one.  The no payments for 2 months will save me 700 that I can use to get my finances back in order while I acclimate at the new job.  Now I felt a little odd about the timing of it all, getting a new car after 5 months of unemployment, but I had to deal with the expiring lease - and it all turned out much better than I was expecting.  I am officially a Californian - I now have a car bigger than I need partly so I am able to see better, sit higher, and represent larger while I am rollin down the highway.  But I just keep reminding myself that the payments are cheaper than what I had so I feel less like a shameless selfish consumer. But its so cute and stuff wanna see ? OK...

"event","Motivation - 

 A late night/early morning disagreement with the boy started with an argument and ended with me crying myself to sleep (again).  He was forced to evolve from an  indignant, insensitive, idiot to a concerned, caressing, caretaker in a single conversation (again).  I have really begun to honestly tell him things I am thinking and feeling.  If I keep up with this honesty he may just end up afraid of me after all.  It's not too many guys that will let you tell them that you find them intellectually inferior, arrogant and embarrassing without so much as flinching at the potential insult of it all.  Of course I would suggest it is his arrogance that keeps him from accepting any of my judgements/opinions/insults as a possible reality.  The cause of the argument (once we got past the name calling), and most likely the cause of me crying myself to sleep once again, is the reality of my employment status.  Or rather, my lack of a job is to blame for all  of this drama.  
My lack of a job is undoubtedly responsible for my lack of finances.  And that lack of money is hurting my ability to feel independent, worthy, successful, accomplished, productive and just about every other positive word I can think of.  But the key element that is missing right now is motivation.  Now if I wanted to I could blame some of my lack of motivation on my joblessness and maybe that would be fair given the depressive state that I have sunk to.  But the reality is that I lacked that real impressive ""go-get'em"", ""show what your made of"", ""get out there and do it"" whatever-ness that makes others so successful. And that missing piece makes me an ever evolving failure, or at least it makes me feel like one.  And this is honestly something I have discussed with those professional types who listen but never really fix anything.  So when the guy points at one of my biggest ""self admitted"" flaws and blames it for everything that is wrong between us, how am I to argue with that?  Of course that last question is rhetorical, because although he whipped out the zinger that should have made him the winner in the battle I kept on fighting until I was satisfied that I was the winner - but this is all tangent anyway. 
 So I pose this quandary?
Where does motivation come from?  How does one get it or get more of it?   

I figure I have spent days, if not weeks and months of my life trying to figure out this motivation thing.  I have asked other people and have never found an answer to be satisfying.  I can blame depression for wanting to sleep all day and live in a dream world without the complications of finances and career failures.  But when I do get up why don't I try to make the house as clean as possible, why don't I want to stop watching TV and go outside and do something, why do I have a million and one excuses for not going to the gym.  Why do I procrastinate so much?  Why am I satisfied with just getting by, not going the extra mile, not trying harder? 

The only thing I do know about motivation is that right now doing something just to avoid an argument is no longer enough motivation for me to do it.   If it was I would be too busy trying to live up to someone else's unreal expectations in order to dodge the disagreements and I wouldn't have time to wonder about all of this - but that's a rant for another day.

The guy thinks that when I get a job, that things will return to normal and all of the drama will go away.  I am not so sure that it will, maybe it won't be the drama that goes away - because I don't know how to fix this motivation ""problem"".  Maybe the thing that goes away will be him."

"event","What's in a name?

 Lately I put so much stock in creating user names and identifying myself with something as intangible as a word on a screen.  I feel like it needs to be a real representation of who I am, what I am about, and all those other deeps things I like to think about and avoid trying to answer.  And I get so worried that others will look at it and think I am an idiot, a dork, silly, blah blah blah - (this is where the DR. would say ""we'll get to the self esteem issues later, let's just talk a little more about you for a few minutes..."")
I spent hours trying to come up with some sort of witty name for my journal.  In the end, I decided to just go with a word that seemed to best describe me. I came across it at about 2 am while randomly looking up words in the thesaurus that I that could aptly be used to describe me.


Harlequin -  A conventional buffoon of the commedia dell'arte, traditionally presented in a mask and parti-colored tights. 
A clown; a buffoon. 
 
Among the many synonyms I found in the Thesaurus are the following words or descriptions:
Changing, versatility, instability, restless, agitated, capricious, dramatic, wit, joker & zany

Harlequinade  n. 
A comedy or pantomime in which Harlequin is the main attraction. 
Farcical clowning or buffoonery. 

Ok so it was about 2 am and my gauge for creativity and originality was not working as well as it should have. Given that the term harlequin <i>could</i> be used to describe me on both my best and worst days, I decided to name the journal my Harlequin aide.  Get it?  It's a little play on words there. (and harlequinade was already taken - so much for originality) Yeah, it lacks the some of the creativity, wit and deepness of statement I was shooting for.  But most of the time I lack the creativity, wit and deepness of statement (and purpose) I am shooting for.  So it's kinda cheesy, slightly witty, trying too hard, and I am stuck with it (how ironic that I cannot change the name chosen to reflect my ever changing personality...).  I guess all in all it is fairly fitting.  And it's growing on me.  It kinda represents how I feel about myself both definitively and metaphorically- it's not perfect, not what I was hoping it would be, but the more I look at it it's not as tragically flawed as I thought it was.  As for the name, the forecast is for slow and gradual acceptance with a good chance of periodic loathing and disappointment.  

What's in a name?  Well metaphorically speaking, I guess I am.

So,  uhm anyway, hi... What's in a name?

What's in a screen name? An introduction, a beginning, a representation of a complicated world, confusion, indecisiveness, a place to hide...a place to start.

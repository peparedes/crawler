"event","Yes, I've started the countdown.  I kind of felt guilty starting it before, but now, I'm done.  There are so many feelings associated with moving.  I'm so sad to leave this place behind (no, it's really true).  I've made some great friends, got involved in an amazing church, was blessed to be part of the Hanover Wind Symphony...  I'm really gonna miss NYC, the mountains, and the shore.  I won't miss the crazy drivers or the ridiculousness of keeping up with everybody else in town who's richer than you.  But despite my insistence that I hate NJ, I really will miss this place.  

But, I'm soooo excited to go back home.  I still feel like a loser moving back in with my parents, but I dont' really care.  Some of my good friends still live at home.  It's not like I'll be totally mooching.  Once I get settled and find a good job, I plan to pay rent.  At least a little bit...  I'm soooo excited to see my family, and hug my nephew, and walk through the woods behind my house, and have my old room back, and just be HOME again!!!

Feels like just yesterday, I had these big dreams of moving to a new place and finding myself, being someone new and better, having a great adventure.  And you know what?  I really have.  It's just weird that it only lasted two years and now it's over.... it's like life, fast forwarded.  I guess that's the cool thing about my job.  I get to start over completely every year or two.  

Well, here's to the next big adventure!!"

"event","Because being at home makes me feel nostalgic...

Your senior year in High School is supposed to be ""the best year of your life."" Let's see how much you remember. I know for some it might be hard for you to go back that far!

Year: 2000

1. Who was your best friend?
Lauren Jarrell and Greg Steele

2. What sports did you play?
none

3. What kind of car did you drive?
none.... my mom's minivan when needed :P

4. It's Friday night, where were you?
in the fall, marching at a football game... other times, maybe the movies or Lauren's house

5. Were you a party animal?
haha

umm no.  i was in the band crowd

7. Ever skip school?

9. Were you a nerd?
yeah. just a little bit.

10. Did you get suspended/expelled?
nope

11. Can you sing the alma mater?
no, but I could play it!

12. Who was your favorite teacher?
Umm I don't know... Mr. McKinney probably (what a hottie :P)

13. Favorite class?

Beaver Area High School

15. School mascot?
Bobcat

16. Did you go to Prom?
Yep, with Greg

17. If you could go back and do it over, would you?

18. What do you remember most about graduation?
Being really sad and thinking how I might never see most of these people again

Nobody

23. Where did you go most often for lunch?

24. Have you gained weight since then?

Ahhh high school.   Funny how I don't speak to anyone from high school anymore.  At all.  Unless you count Greg.  But I don't count him because we went to college together too so he moved into the college friends category.  :P

K.  That was all.  I'll actually update this in a few days probably.  :P"

Conscientiousness:

"event","I haven't really updated in, um, forever... so here's a few tidbits just to satisfy your curiosity (cuz I know you've been dying to know).  This weekend I hung out with Sharon all day on Saturday.  It's just so nice to have someone you can spend ten hours with and not run out of things to say.  I am so thankful for a friend like that.  Sunday I went out to dinner with a few nanny friends.  We went to the Black Horse in Mendham, which is always excellent.

Last weekend I had to work, since both parents are doing monthly National Guard drills again.  Blah.

Work.  Well, don't get me started.  I'm very frustrated and ready to be done.  Some people are just hard to work with/for.

Band is great.  We're working on some new stuff on our website (okay, the webmaster and director are... not me, per se).  They want to put up some professional photos we took at our last concert, as well as some sound recordings.   They will also be taking individual photos of us this week and putting those up with a bio of each of us.  So check me out sometime soon. ;)   www.hanoverwinds.org.  They do all this cool stuff right when I'm getting ready to leave.  :(

Last week I played my euphonium at church with a bunch of other musicians.  We are doing 40 Days of Purpose during Lent, so we had a big kickoff service with all three services combined into one.  It was a lot of fun playing, we had some great music.  Fast upbeat stuff as well as old hymns and great praise tunes.  There was a big screen that they were broadcasting it on, and apparently I was on there a couple times.  So many people came up to me later and said they saw me, and they didn't know I played an instrument, and what was that thing anyway?  Haha....  Good times.

I think I need new glasses.  My eye has been twitching for over a month (off and on, not constantly), and I thought it was from lack of sleep or being stressed, but now I'm beginning to think it's my eyesight going bad in that eye.  The twitching stops when I take off my glasses (although then I get a headache from trying to focus my eyes).  And I don't have vision insurance, so there goes my next paycheck, at least.

Guess that's it for now.  I'm just counting the days till the end of summer.  :/"

I'm in this program called MyPoints, which is free and gives you points for just clicking on emails, or for ordering stuff from all kinds of sites through their site.  I also have their credit card, which is where I get a lot of my points.  And when you get a certain number of points, you can get a free gift card!  I always order a Barnes and Noble gift card, cuz I love books, and it's a special treat since it's free.  Free books!  So far in the past few years that I've been in the program, I've redeemed gift cards for about $150, all at Barnes and Noble.  Do you know how many books that is?? I just found out they also carry Panera gift cards so I may get that next time...  Anyway.  I just ordered the set of three Christy movies (the new ones) from Barnes and Noble and only had to pay $6 for them after my $25 gift card.  How exciting is that?   So if I get my friends to sign up and earn some points, I get extra points.... and you get gift cards for free.  ;)   If you want in on the action, let me know!"

"event","Okay I have been wanting to write about this for awhile now.  But now I really have to say something.  These Muslim riots are just ridiculous.  I will say that to disrespect someone's religion like that is wrong.  They shouldn't have made those cartoons in the first place.  I'm not condoning or encouraging making fun of others' beliefs.  However, the way that many Muslims are taking this is even worse!  It's just reprehensible that they are out there killing people and destroying property just because they are offended.  That's ridiculous.  I've read a few different articles about this, and I really like <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1156609-1,00.html"">this </a>one.&nbsp; ""Freedom means learning to deal with being offended."" &nbsp; Yes!<br><br>For example, Christians are ridiculed often in our society.&nbsp; Take TV.&nbsp; Recently, NBC started to run a sitcom called The Book of Daniel, which obviously was pointing fun at Christians and essentially labeling them as hypocrites.&nbsp; I'm not denying that there are hypocrites in the Christian religion, but don't lump us all together.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp; That was very offensive to anyone who could honestly call themselves a Christian.&nbsp; But were Christians burning NBC's studios?&nbsp; Were they putting out hits on NBC execs and writers?&nbsp; Bombing TV stations who played the show?&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; We sent out petitions, wrote letters to TV stations and to NBC, and boycotted the show.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; The show is no longer on.&nbsp; Nobody was watching it.&nbsp; <br><br>Today I read <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/02/12/italy.berlusconi.reut/index.html"">this </a>one.&nbsp; Italy's Prime Minister called himself the ""Christ of politics.""&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; That offends me greatly.&nbsp; How dare anyone call himself Christ?&nbsp; That's horrible, it's blasphemous, and makes me cringe.&nbsp; But I'm not going to go try and kill him.&nbsp; Firstly because it goes against my beliefs and is just wrong (imagine that).&nbsp; But secondly because it's called free speech!&nbsp; He's allowed to say it.&nbsp; I'm allowed to be offended.&nbsp; <br><br>Freedom means learning to deal with being offended.&nbsp; Deal with it, without resorting to violence and destroying other people's property and lives.<br>


EDIT: I've done a little more research, and I guess I didn't really know what was in the cartoons before.  But I believe they weren't written to make fun of Muslims; rather, they were political cartoons pointing out injustices in the Muslim world.  I will condone that, as it is true.  So scratch that part about the cartoons shouldn't have been written.  They should have.  The truth is hard to deal with sometimes.

EDIT 2:  Here's another perfect example.  The recent Rolling Stone magazine with Kanye West on the cover portrayed as Jesus Christ.  Excuse me?  That disgusted me, to say the least.  Absolutely horrendously wrong.  How dare they?  How dare he?  Extremely offensive.  Worth killing people over?  Absolutely not.  As one of CNN's bloggers pointed out, in our culture, we value human life.  How about they respect OUR values for once since they insist we respect theirs?"

"event","1. My roommate once: kidnapped me complete with a blindfold, hands tied, and holding a rifle (from colorguard) and walked me back into the woods where she said she was going to kill me.  But really, she just took me out to eat for my birthday.  :p

2. Never in my life have I: been kissed.  Sad but true.

3. The one person who can drive me nuts, but then can always manage to make me smile: both my kids.

4. High School was: a long time ago.  I was such a different person then.

5. When I'm nervous: I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

6. The last time I cried was: today during Bible study.  Going over old wounds is hard...

7. If I were to get married right now my bridesmaids/groomsmen would be: uhhh.  Beth would be the maid of honor, and then Jeannine and Meredith.

9. My hair: is pretty cool when it wants to behave

10. When I was 5: I loved playing on the seesaw in my kindergarten class

11. Last Christmas I: was soooo happy to be home

12. When I turn my head left, I see: Claudius, in his usual spot right next to me on the bed.

16. If I were a character on Friends I'd be: probably Monica... but not so clean

17. By this time next year: I'll most likely be in a new job and a new place and maybe my own apartment?

18. Current Relationship Status: single 

19. I have a hard time understanding: the way many parents treat their kids.  There really should be a parenting class before new parents are allowed to leave the hospital with their baby.

20. One time at a family gathering: I remember one family reunion at a state park near my Pappy's house... there was food... and lots of old people I didn't know... and wading in the river.  

21. You know I ""like"" you if: I flirt with you.  Yes I do in fact flirt.  It mainly comes in the form of joking around.  If I never joke around with you and try to get you to laugh, I probably don't like you.

22. If I won an award, the first person(people) I'd thank is/are: my family

23. Take my advice: If God brought you to it, He can bring you through it.  

24. My ideal breakfast is: a blueberry bagel with cream cheese and a Dunkin Donuts iced mocha latte with sugar

25. If you visit my hometown: I'd be jealous cuz that's where I wish I was.

26. Where do you plan to visit anytime soon: NYC next weekend with Lindsay :P

27. If you spend the night at my house: you'd see the craziness that is my boys

28. I'd stop my wedding if: you mean right in the middle?  or beforehand?   If I found out my fiance had lied about something, then I would probably stop it... for one example.

29. The world could do without: terrorists who think blowing up buildings, other people, and themselves will solve anything (especially when they do it in the name of religion)

30. I'd rather lick the belly of a cockroach than date: an arrogant, cocky jerk.  I couldn't name one right now but you know what I mean.

31. Most recent thing you've bought yourself: Dunkin Donuts iced mocha latte.  I'm addicted.

32. Most recent thing someone else bought for you: Jill had us over for lunch after Bible Study today, does that count?

33. My favorite blonde is: who do I know that's blonde?  If you're blonde, then you're it...

34. My favorite brunette is: you know, picking favorites never helped anybody...

35. And by the way: the Steelers are sweet. In case you didn't know.  (going with Beth's answer.  Cuz it's true.)

36. The last time I was high: I went snow tubing!  That mountain was not real high, but it counts.

37. The animals I would like to see flying besides birds are: people.  I would so love to fly.

38. I shouldn't have been: insulting people this weekend just for laughs.  I didn't mean anything by it but that's what I do when I want to fit in.

39. Once, at a bar: this creepy dork I grew up with offered to buy me a drink (it was my 21st birthday).  I told him no thanks.

40. Last night I: really wanted to stay up and watch Ben shave his beard on Letterman.  But I was too tired from this weekend.

41. There's this boy I know who: is a really awesome friend despite all the crap I've put him through.

42: I dont know: how to whistle.  Well, technically, I know how, I just can't do it.

43. A better name for me would be: lazy butt.  Cuz that's what I am.

44. If I ever go back to school I'll: hahahahahahahahaha!!  Go back to school?  Are you nuts?  Okay, actually, I am taking a class next month on photography, and I'm kind of excited.   :P

45. How many days until my birthday? : 70 days exactly.  yay :)"

"event","So tonight at band I was discussing with cute stand partner the fact that the other two members of our section have had babies recently. (Well, Dan's baby is due next week... Matt's was in the fall.)  So Mike said, ""Man, I'm feeling left out.""  Then I said, ""Yeah, Mike, we better get started.""  hehehe...  Then he got all red (I think I embarrassed him... he wouldn't even look at me) and said, ""Whoa!  Not so shy over there, are you?""  I was thinking about saying, ""I didn't mean it like that!!!""..... but I did...... So I said, ""Take it however you want to!""   lol

"event","Well not much is new.  Except that weather this week, man that was weird.  Saturday night we lost power for awhile because the wind had knocked some trees over, cutting power lines.  Too much rain and wind!  There are trees down all over the place.  I really haven't seen that many trees down ever.  It looked like a hurricane went through.  Some people were without power for days.  It happened again overnight Tuesday.  The boys didn't have school on Wednesday because the school had no power.  Woo that was a fun day.  Crazy kids.  Crazy weather!  And today it was sunny and almost 60!  So weird.  I'll take this weather though, it's perfect.  I think it was only for today though...

Tomorrow I'm going bowling with Nanny Alliance.  And Sunday is a Steelers party at Bethany's for the NJ Nannies.  Yay!  I am sooo excited for the Steelers game.  Kick some butt, guys!  And Sharon is coming with me, yay! She finally gets to meet my nanny friends!

Umm what else....  Oh band.  Of course. :)  Band is my refuge.  I love it sooo much.  I feel like I'm such a dork, but I don't care.  I can't even explain it, really.  It's just the one place I know I belong.  I feel so comfortable sitting there in my section, my euphonium on my lap.  I know my place, you know?  And I just love making music.  It's such an amazing feeling.  I'm going to be soooo sad to leave this band.  :(  But, oh yeah.  We're making a professional recording!!  Like, one that will be sold on Amazon.com, you know?  We do a CD every year from one of the concerts, but just sell it to the members of the band (yes I have both of them from the years I was in it).  This one will be professionally recorded (our director knows someone) at our May concert, which we're doing with Paul Cohen, a great saxophone guy (yeah, I know, saxophone.  blech.).  Hehe...  But... so cool.  I'm going to be on Amazon!  Look for me later this year.... :p

I'm watching Princess Diaries 2.  I just love this movie.  It is sooo much better than the first.  The guy who plays Nicholas, mmmm.  I love him!  Just thought I'd share.

Okay I guess that's about it.  I'm rambling about nothing now.  Thanks for reading.  :p"

"event","So.... not a whole lot of stuff going on.  Last night was our first band rehearsal since the beginning of December, and it made me very happy.  :)  Trombone player- no go.  I don't know why he keeps catching my eye, but other than that first time we talked, he hasn't been overly nice to me ever. Actually he's seemed like kind of a jerk whenever I try to talk to him.  So, I guess he was just being nice and giving me a compliment on my playing that one night.  I'll take it.  And stop overanalyzing.  :p  (And start daydreaming about cute stand partner once again.... lol)

Andy asked me if I was planning on leaving when Lea got back (February) so I said no.  He said good, that they really want me to stay at least through the summer.  So I told him I wasn't sure when I wanted to leave, but maybe at the end of the summer.  So there.  That's out there now, even if it's just a big maybe.  I guess the big talk can wait awhile now, since the end of the summer is still about eight months away. (I need to give at least six weeks' notice according to my contract.)

Oh!  Christmas!  Okay... well I did a whole lot of shopping... that was pretty much it.  I got to see Meredith (twice!  I ran into her at the Grove City outlets, and then had lunch with her the next day).  And one night I went to Greg and Amber's along with Heather and we played Scene It Movie edition, which was sooo much fun.  I won the first game :p and Greg won the second.  Cody didn't come... I never emailed (okay I'm a jerk) and he never called Greg back after Greg left him a message (apparently he's never home?).  I don't know what my problem is.  I keep making this way more complicated than it needs to be.  Sigh...

And I got a new computer last month.  Yay!  As my dad said, Dude, I got a Dell.  Haha, yes he did say that.  Oh, more of Christmas!  Sorry, sidetracked too easily...   I got some way cool stuff, including a beautiful amethyst necklace, a thistle necklace, a really nice Eeyore watch, a nature sounds cd/radio/alarm clock (wahoo!), a paint by number kit, a pooh and eeyore rug (which claudius has taken over), a couple Eeyore bean bag animals that I collect, a couple bells which I also collect, a couple shirts, a picture of my sis and I at Central Park, a book called 14,000 Things to Make You Happy (or something like that.... I'll have to start writing some of those in here.  They're great), (checks box still sitting on my floor....), and The Procrastinator's Planner for 2006 from Jeannine.  Does she know me or what?  Haha... I should really start using that... Maybe tomorrow.

Hahahahaha did you get that?  I crack myself up.

Don't you love it when I update when I'm tired and giddy?

All right I'm going to stop now and go to bed.  So much for getting there early.  :/"

Wow.... I don't remember a whole lot of 2005.... I don't know what happened to it! That's pretty sad.

You know what makes me the most sad out of that list?  I didn't stay up till sunrise ever in 2005.  Not once.  I guess college is really over.  :("

Your feelings are likely to seem somewhat repressed at times.

You are apt to be much more practical, rational, and conscious of details.

You are a sprite of the Air: Fun loving and<br>childish your naive nature only enhances how<br>truly cute you are! You may come off as too<br>childish but only because your not burdened<br>with all the rules and regulations of<br>adulthood. You are carefree most of the time<br>spending your days playing tag or naming all<br>the clouds you see in the sky. You are<br>generally kind to everyone because you have<br>lots of love and happiness to share! Making<br>friends comes easy because they strive for the<br>innocence you possess but be careful, being as<br>nice and kind hearted as you are people will<br>try to manipulate your nature if they have not<br>already. Don't ever let anyone mold you to<br>their standards although I doubt anyone could.

Like fire, you have a hot<br>temper and you can be warm and loving as well<br>and angry and wild. It all really comes down to<br>what you are feeling. You have a lot of close<br>friends who you are very protective over, and<br>with your temper probably some enemies too. You<br>are not Miss Popular in school since you are<br>your own person and don't want to be forced<br>into behaving this or that way. You are the<br>untamed wild horse, the kind that everyone<br>wants to catch. But you don't want to be tied<br>down for the moment and just keep going with<br>your little crushes. Your will is strong and if<br>you set your mind to do something, you will<br>most likely succeed. But beware, your friends<br>may not always accept your mood-swinging<br>behaviour. Even if you don't mean to be mean,<br>they can still feel hurt. You just need to<br>start thinking some things through before you<br>do them, and not always jump in with so much<br>courage. One day you may be hurt because of<br>that, but then again, your element isn't fire<br>if you start to analyse situations before you<br>act. After all, your nature is to shoot first<br>and ask the questions later. Rate and message!

Its hard to say your okay,
in the midst of hurt and strife
you seek and find and persevere
through every stage of life

you wonder what the future holds
how sucessful you will be 
but you often fail to tell yourself
""i believe in me.""

You seek to find acceptance
you conform to their new ways
you lose hold of all your values
and slowly drift astray

your passion soon becomes
something very hard to see
again you fail to tell yourself
""I believe in me.""

you search for joy and happiness,
but somehow come up short
you didn't seek gods will this time,
or wait for his report

He wanted you to ask him 
""What is it that i need?""
so simple was the answer,
""just believe in me."""

"event","""Lord, I've so often wondered,
  why people have to know pain,
Why, when they need the sunshine,
  do You often send them rain?
I've tried so hard to percieve it,
  why things happen the way that they do,
That I've often felt so hopeless,
  fustrated and furious,too.
But somehow I've come to realize,
  at last I finally can see,
That You have given me my life,
  and how I live it is all up to me.
So You can't be blamed for my sorrow,
  You cant be blamed for my pain,
And I need to stop hoping for sunshine,
  and instead see the beauty of rain.
For someday I know I might be there,
  standing happily next to Your side,
And I want to be worthy of heaven,
  and to leave only good things behind.""

And, surely you shall be OK, as you receive and allow.

a wise man wrote this on a friends journal and i felt so captivated by it and its meaning that i thought i should repost it for all to see and reflect on its words. i know first hand that the heart lies and it also hurts badly but not only to the person whos owns the heart and the one breaking it, but also the people who have stood by and watched that heart grow and learn just to see it torn in pieces...i know i may be rambling but yeah its been a long day..."

He said: ""Just think it over, and write me a list,
""So we can figure out what we both deserve.""
She hardly could believe it, that their love had come to this:
Dividing an' deciding his and hers.
But she grabbed a paper napkin, an' asked the waitress for a pen.
An' one by one, she wrote down what she wanted most from him.

""Honesty, sincerity, tenderness and trust.
""A little less time for the rest of the world,
""And more for the two of us.
""Kisses each mornin', 'I love you's' at night,
""Just like it used to be.
""The way life was when you were in love with me.""

She reached across the table an' placed it in his hand,
An' said: ""You know this isn't easy for me.""
As he thought about the new car, the house an' the land,
An' wondered what that bottom line would be.
An' a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind,
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find:

""Honesty, sincerity, tenderness and trust.
""A little less time for the rest of the world,
""And more for the two of us.
""Kisses each mornin', 'I love you's' at night,
""Just like it used to be.
""The way life was when you were in love with me.""

Well, he fought back the tears, as he looked in her eyes,
An' said: ""I don't know where to start.""
An' she said: ""Everything on that list in your hand,
""Is hidden somewhere in your heart.

""Honesty, sincerity, just like it used to be.
""The way life was when you were in love with me."""

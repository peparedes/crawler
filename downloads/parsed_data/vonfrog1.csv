"event","All right.. As you all know, I work for the local news again... It's been a while since I've posted so my ranting is a little back logged.. But this time I have a compound rant... So a few months back a 13 year old kid and his mother were raped at gun point, then the kid was forced to have sex with his mother after the gang rape occurred. The assailants were all teenagers themselves in their early teens. then a few weeks back a 15 year old boy was raped in a Wal-Mart public restroom, during the day! 

Okay.. My heart goes out a little for these people because of their tragic episodes, but what kind of population of non-self respecting or honoring pussies have we become!? You're pointing a gun at me and you want me to do what to my mother? Shoot me instead! you're going to violate me in unimaginable ways? Forget that.. Either you're going to kill me in th process or you're going to lose a fuckin' eye! What happened to self defense, kicking and screaming? You'd rather be emotionally and socially scarred, not to mention, probably physically scarred, for the rest of your life by some pervert? What the fuck is wrong with this picture. 

I'd rather be dead then have to deal with that nightmare. Hell my thought process is that the forensics is already all over the place... That's right asshole... Shoot me... Then you'll spend the next 10 to 20 if not life being someone else's bitch... 

then there's this 15 year old kid in the public restroom. I cut the video that was provided from the security cameras of the rapist leaving the bathroom. It was a busy time of day! there were people all around. How could you stand by and let some guy fuck you in a public restroom without making a sound? I really don't understand that. Fight back! Scream! Punch! Kick!

I ranted this point to another guy I work with. He went on about how the kid was probably embarrassed. And when a gun gets pointed at you, you freeze up. All right.. I probably understand the freeze part. But shock only lasts so long until adrenaline takes over. And it's not like these kids went in, got their rocks off and left.. They spent hours tormenting and violating this woman and her son. At that point, rummage for anything that you can bash, cut or stab with! Bite and kick! Scream for goodness' sake!

At 13 and 15 you should know better. This is how I feel. You should have some level of self respect, honor and self preservation. Your body is YOUR body. Never let anyone violate your body. These are lessons we should be teaching our kids from day one! My daughter turned 1 last week.. And I promise that I Will do what I can to ingrain the idea of independence, honor, respect and preservation into her very being. you should do the same."

"event","All right.. So it's been all over the media.. The latest school massacre and the memories of other just like it... So now it's back to one of my favorite topics of, ""Don't forget to spank your kids!"" I'm sick and tired of hearing, ""Well they were bullied and it was just a matter of time..."" Well you know what? Shut the fuck up! You know what... That's a cop out way of looking at it.. It's not the media, it's not other kids it's the parents... These kids have problems and the first thing they do is put a hole in the first innocent person they see... If that kid had been spanked and taught to take responsibility and the ability to redirect negative energy that shit would have never happened... Been bullied and had problems my ass... I know plenty of kids that lived far more fucked up lives and are very highly socially adjusted. Everyone's buried the good old fashioned fist fight, they've pushed the idea of sex and hormones being a sin and a thing that you should be ashamed of and that it's okay not to stand up for yourself and push the responsibility on other people... This has got to stop or more bad things are going to keep on happening. Shape up! Our kids need guidance and vigilance.. They need to learn independence. We are raising a future of pussies. This sheltered, plastic molded, seat belt wearing, padded and protected life-style that we have created for our kids is destroying us. We need to quit making excuses for our problems and start dealing with them. So what if a girl dumped you or someone bullied you, big fucking deal! Do like any red blooded human would do and drink yourself blind for a few days then get your shit together and get back on track. And since none of these kids learned responsibility, future mothers and scientists are dead... Someone's sister, brother or lover is dead. Children of parents who did what was best are dead. And to all those psychologists, parents, law makers and teachers who ever said, ""Well they were picked on and shouldn't be held accountable? There's this soft piece of flesh between my nut sack and asshole.... Hum on that!

And to those misguided maladjusted youths that decided or are going to decide it's easier to put an end to someone elses life instead of becoming goth/emo and writing music/poems about it, get over yourselves! You should have stopped and thought about your actions. No heartbreak is ever worth killing over and life can be far worse. Shut up and ride it out or get off the train by yourself"

"event","Okay.. There's no shortage of things to bitch about, It's just that I'm too freakin' tired to bitch about them! Hell.. I'm even too tired to rub one out... you know it's a bad scene when you're forced to neglect even the necessities. School.. Work... Living with the in-laws. The stress never stops. Oh yeah.. And for those of you out there that know what I look like. I did cut my hair. Yup.. It's short.. Then people ask, ""Why did you cut your hair?"" Because change is good sometimes. Plus I think I look pretty swank with short hair. Now if only it'll finally grow to that shaggy stage that is still brushible and looks cool.. Or my favorite... ""Did you get a hair cut?"" No dumb ass... My hair happened to fall out in this shape... what the fuck did you think? Any way.. I just needed to post here so that everyone out there knows that I'm still alive.. As far projects, jobs and hobbies.. I'll fill you in later."

"event","So here I am.. What.. About 5 months in hiding? Well I'm back... Sure I don't post as often as I'd like, but I like leaving my audience in suspense for my next cruel words to the general public. Lois has been born and is 4 months now, I'm back in television and I'm almost done with massage therapy. Things are looking up. So now... For a while I worked at a Kohl's... I was in charge of the toy section from time to time.. Let me tell you what... I'm paid to clean up, not clean up after the White trash and Wet Backs that roam through the store... THE TOY SECTION IS NOT A DAY CARE!!! And random shelves are not for your trash and empties. Put back shit where you found it and for God's Sake, Spank your children! If I have to witness another tantrum throwing little shit screaming at the top of their lungs, I'm going to intervene.. or at least say something. I'm sick of PC. I have the right to offend, just as every one of those over sensitive baby boomers have the right to be offended. Any way... I'm going to leave with this quick thought, ""When you're out and about, do yuo ever stop to think about the other people around you? Like what they're doing, who they are, do they have kids? You know.. the other human beings that we bump into day after day... well you should.. And hug everyone you know constantly..."""

"event","Okay, so all of my readers are going, ""Yeah, so you've returned and ranted, but where the Fuck have you been for the passed year."" Well I'll tell you. I think the last anyone heard from me was that I had started building sets for a theater in a place my sister dubs, ""Cold-White-ville,"" A.K.A Sullivan Illinois. The place is 97% caucasian because they like the chinese resteraunt on the corner. Any way. Around Christmas of last year I was canned from my postion there. Or should I say POSITIONS. 3 full time positions at the same place and I wasn't getting anything done in a timely manner. Whatever! 

Any way, Sarah and I moved back to Calfornia and into her parent's house in January. We found out that we are pregnant. The baby is due the end of this month. It's a girl and her name is Lois... And yes Godammit, she will be a Dodough! I've gone back to school for my massage therapy certification while I'm working full time for a remodeling company. We're currently doing okay. That's the sum-up of my where-abouts as of late. 

I can't say I'm happy with living at her parent's house, but I am happy that we're getting some help with baby stuff. Now if we can just get them to stop smoking inside once the baby gets here, things will be fine. Well I hope I've put your wondering at ease. I'll be back on soon with a really good rant soon."

"event","okay.. I just got home from school and all I have to say is, ""I KNOW THAT MODEL COMES STANDARD WITH A BLINKER YOU JERK OFF!!!"" I mean come on Dammit! People, know how to drive. You had to take some kind of compitency exam to get your damn liscense, right? When in the far left lane, you move over to the lane on your right as soon as possible when you see someone driving up your ass! It's the correct thing to do.. That's the fast lane! Not the, ""I'm already going the speed limit, so you're going to have to deal with me not going any faster than this."" Lane. It's for the people that want to take the risk of going faster than posted.. Oh and it's also the lane you go on to pass other people on the freeway! Also... Check your mirrors, THEN LOOK IN YOUR FUCKING BLIND SPOT BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT LANE CHANGE!! I think I'm gong to start carrying a megaphone in my car, so when someone does something stupid, I can yell at them properly. And don't give me that Damn excuse that you don't understand english. If you don't, I'll treat you like a moron, by slowing my speech down and talking louder at you! Because that always works right?

So get a hands free or put the phone away! Turn the god damn music down. Take all those stupid ass sun beaten stuffed animals out of your rear window. Quit putting on the make-up and doing your hair and fucking drive! And not just put your wittle foot down on the widdle pedal to make you go! Use courtesy, common sense and intelligence when you drive! God dammit!"

Researched and studied for my test on Monday and took a nap. Surely that didn't take 16 hours. So where did my time go?

"event","That's right Peeps! the Frog is back and badder than ever. Yeah, I'll admit I betrayed you for a while and had my Myspace moment. But I like the feeling of this blog better. Forgive my weakness.

So I'll get back into the swing of things with a good rant. And to start off with I'm going to say: All you Pansy ass middle aged parents that want to hold your children's hands through everything are turning your kids into a generation of panty waists! Look... With your Fuckin' Padded this, sterilized this, safety harness this and plastic molded that, we are thinning the gene pool of any self reliance and self sufficient mentality that may be left. 

Oh I'm sure you're thinking, ""I'm doing my best to make things easy and safe for my children!"" Well you know what? You're succeeding! In fact you're doing such a good job that your kids don't know how to do things on their own anymore. They're not learning how to handle the real world. It's still all about survival. If your kid chokes to death on a swing set? I'm glad that stupid gene didn't get passed on to a new generation! and remember: a certain level of germs are actually healthy for you!

remember the play ground you grew up on? Molten hot, black asphault with hot steel bars jutting up out of the ground. You survived right? The idea was that you'd walk away learning something about life and how to learn that if you're going to climb to the top of the tower and fall, rub some spit on that raspberry and get back on again when you're ready. And don't cry because it was your own stupid ass fault that you fell off in the first place! 

okay, So what sparked this tantrum? I'm going to school for massage therapy. It's at a vocational college for the medical arts. That's means it's not just massage therapy. Well I heard in the hallway a girl was complaining about how she's going to get a note from her ""Daddy"" demanding that they allow her to use notes on her final and practical. I almost shit my pants! then she went on to say how she's going to sue for unfair treatment if they don't! All I have to say is that if you don't know your shit by the time of the practical, I don't want you to have anything to do with my well being.

Quit over-coddling your kids! It's not healthy! LIke I said.. All about survival!

Oh! Here's an article on this specific subject.

I may not know too much about one specific subject, but I can hold my own when someone asks me what the origami unicorn at the end of ""Bladerunner"" means. And believe me baby... Me and THAC0 are in like Flynn! sometimes I do ""Overdork."" Now I know that everyone out there has their ""Overdork"" moments, but being able to draw the line is what makes us all Dork Lords.

        I have here some examples of ""Overdork,"" That I'd like to share. Which overdorks are you guilty of? Just being guilty of one or two isn't really an overdork. But prolonged offenses may be. 

-You have 10 dice that have 6 sides and 30 others that don't.
-You verbally wish you could use so and so force power.
-You know the name of the Chick Tract that gives D&D over to the eternal damnation of HELL.
-""Kaplah"" is part of your daily vocabulary.
-Correct the last sentence... I dare you.
-Your THAC0 has been so low, you couldn't even hit yourself!
-You can name any card in your deck off the top of your head.

We're talking about Samhane, All Hallows eve! The one day out of the year when the dead return to the Earth! So what's all the costume and candy all about? You disguise your kids so that the dead don't steal them. And the treats are so that the dead take the food and don't come in to the house. Screw all this, ""I wanna be Batman"" business. Educate your damn kids will you!? Grab all the fake blood you can and storm the streets with the dead come back to life. Though, it is a real treat to see all those sexy nurses, nuns, cheerleaders and cat-girls...

But that was yesterday. another uneventful Halloween come and gone. Today however is Dia de los Muertos. The day set aside to remember the dead. But according to some redneck the other day, ""That's some spick holiday aint it? Why would I need to know that?"" Eat shit you uncultured FUCK!!! I hate the Mid-West.

So tonight, remember someone close to you that has passed on. Feliz y dias de los Muertos."

It's a little pamphlet full of destructive, fanatic, slippery slope PROPAGANDA. I'm sure a few of you out there have unwittingly picked one of these up while browsing at your local book/religious/second hand/ma&pa shop. I'm sure the people that own these shops don't know how destructive these little nuggets of anti-common sense are. So for you're enjoyment, I have one of these masterpieces, done up in true MST3K style, about the dangers of playing D&D... After all.. we all know that playing D&D will lead us all into the ETERNAL PITS OF DAMNATION!!!

"event","This weekend was fairly uneventful. It was the first time, in a long time, I had all my time and worries to myself... This doesn't happen very often. I stayed in. I didn't go anywhere, I didn't do anything. I just did the dishes, cleaned my room, watched movies until all hours of the night, kept to myself and thought. I did get some things straightened out. I'm not usually the hermit, but it was nice. this Monday started up nice and smooth. I hope things keep this smooth until next Friday. 

On other thoughts. A lot of people from the passed had resurfaced earlier last week. Not like one or two old friends and comrades. I mean seven people from the passed few years that have not really kept in touch have suddenly re-appeared. Hearing from all of these old acquaintances is a cheery surprise. I like knowing how everyone is doing. Also, some long awaited questions have been answered; and some new ones have risen. But at least everyone is no worse for the wear. I hope more friends IM or call.

The change of Autumn has taken hold. 
The mornings are turning crisp 
and dew rests on every surface possible. 
The yellows and reds have returned to the plains.
Take the land and lay it to rest
for the frost and snow is almost near."

I need to make it back to California or Nevada. the midwest is starting to get on my nerves. People here don't touch each other. They're apologetic and they feel that not accepting something that you've offered is actually polite! What the hell! I watched a group of people have a conversation today for about an hour (I was on lunch) No one even stood inside any form of someone else's bubble! they all stood about the same distance from each other, and whenever one of them would move, the rest would shift around as to keep the same spacing.

I've taken it upon myself to hug at least one person a day here. though this hasn't been a new mission in this area, I am renewing the determination with which I am pursuing it. People here don't touch and it drives me nuts. even when sitting at a table next to someone. And if you hug a young girl that you're familiar with... you're obviously trying to fuck her! *sigh* 

People here also feel the need to justify there heterosexuality all the time! and if anything shakes their belief about anything, they get mad at it. People here are really weird. though I do like the fact that everyone will stop to give a quick hello. I've been here for a year now and I'm still in culture shock. But at least I can sleep in tomorrow."

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/K/Koshari/1072669473_otTheDevil.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""The Devil Card""><br>You are the Devil card. The Devil is based on the<br>figure Pan, Lord of the Dance. The earthy<br>physicality of the devil breeds lust. The<br>devil's call to return to primal instincts<br>often creates conflict in a society in which<br>many of these instincts must be kept under<br>control. Challenges posed by our physical<br>bodies can be overcome by strength in the<br>mental, emotional, and spiritual realms. Pan is<br>also a symbol of enjoyment and rules our<br>material creativity. The devil knows physical<br>pleasure and how to manipulate the physical<br>world. Material creativity finds its output in<br>such things as dance, pottery, gardening, and<br>sex. The self-actualized person is able to<br>accept the sensuality and usefulness of the<br>devil's gifts while remaining in control of any<br>darker urges.

To bring forth the sun

Call forth the Earth and stop me

Taste the breeze

My arms are wide open.
Take my hands

Laugh for your sorrows.

<TR>
<TD>Based on the results of this test, it is highly likely that: <BR><BR>You prefer your romance and love to wild and daring rather than typical or boring, you would rather pursue than be pursued and, when it comes to physical love, your satisfaction comes more from providing a wonderful time to your partner than simply seeking your own. <BR><BR>This places you in the Lover Style of: <B>The Liberated Lover</B>. <BR><BR>The Liberated Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and forms the kind of free-thinking, sexually-exciting, self-confident lover that society once condemned but that a liberal-mind cherishes and exults. The Liberated Lover is a treasure to find, though it can sometimes be difficult to do so because they are often already engaged in relationships or are in high-demand if ""in the market."" <BR><BR>In terms of physical love, the Liberated Lover is possibly the most thrilling and demanding of all, with the one potential drawback being that it is possible to feel 'overmatched' at times by their prowess and selfless giving. Given trust and understanding, and the right lover, the Liberated Lover can be a delight in bed. <BR><BR>Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Exotic Lover (most of all) or the Carnal Lover, or the Suave Lover. <BR><BR>Congratulations! <BR><BR>If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback!

My co-workers are fed up with my boss, my boss is a drama queen and doesn't appreciate his girl friend, his girlfriend is in denial that he's a cheating pig whore and the mid-west goes from quaint to depressing then quaint again. Earlier today sarah was watching ""Ocean's Eleven"" and I got so home sick for vegas that I almost cried. 

In happier news, Joseph and the Amazing Technocolored Dreamcoat"" opens tonight as the last show for Summerstock this year. We're all really worn out and ready to go home. Building forts and castles is slowly losing its charm here and I'm looking to move on. Up-root and trudge on once again. 

*sigh* I wish I had something really witty and entertaining to say that would lift the spirit and inspire artistic ventures. But, for the moment I'm really burnt out and exhausted. I find myself being tired a lot lately. Wait.. I just thought of something to say... Here goes...

I breathe deeply
and exhale the poisons from my soul
in a scented cloud of smoke.
I drink the waters of serenity
and wash the anger and hatred form my eyes with it.
I step through the doors of peace
and peel the grime that has settled on my flesh from time.
I will retreat for a moment
only to be reborn 
with a new sense of direction and energy.
I must recenter myself,
refocus my vision
and reclaim my vigor.
I am ME, 
I am wonderful ME 
and I will reclaim wonderful ME!


In short.. I'm going to smoke my hookah, have a cup of tea and shower. I have to get ready for opening night."

What the fuck, right? So Sarah and I are thinking on moving back to the west coast, because we're both a little home sick and this mid-west bullshit is really getting on our nerves. (no offense to those in the mid-west) 

So I've met some really nice people around here. People sem to recognise me where ever I go. I guess it's not hard to miss the only dark guy for about 20 miles. Plus I have resumed my title of DORK LORD. Sure it may not be RPG's anymore, but hey, I gotta find my army where I can. Though I am glad that some of my comrades have kept with me. And bless Sarah for turning out to be a good GM.

I've also met some people that enjoy Hookah and tea evenings with. So if things keep goin in this direction, I'll probably stay, but if not, ""HELLLLLO PALM SPRINGS!!!"" I'm pakcing up my shit and going back to sunny California.

Whenever I mention my hookah to anyone here, I get the ""I don't do drugs and neither should you"" speech, or the ""Smoking is bad for you"" speech. Or the people left to hang out with are too young to solicit my ideas to. 

I've already been warned once about my conduct with young children. I have a problem with answering too many questions apparently. Not that I don't mind scandalizing the youth of this sleepy little town. Oh yeah... Did I mention how sheltered a lot of these people are around here? I live in a community where the population is 97% white, and that's only because there's a really good chinese restaurant on the corner. The parents around here are in denial about how much their children know, and if anyone shows them otherwise, they complain to whoever they need to, to eliminate the problem. 

There's no one around here that appreciates Role Playing, Video Games, Anime, Cheezy Movies, or SCA events! How am I supposed to get my DORK fix!? I'm feening bad. The withdrawals are murder... I need a hit man! I need a hit! Just one FUCKING HIT!!! sorry... I got a little carried away... Any way. I'm going to go home and do nothing for the rest of the day... because that's what there is to do around here... Nothing... 

I need a club... I need a Ren Faire... I need the box set of Cowboy Bebop... I fear the Lord of Dorkness has been overpowered. I may be defeated..."

But yet, I still keep pushing on. I guess the job is keeping me happy, and I'm learning a lot of skills that will get me on the good side of plenty of other workshops(tucks welding under belt), but the people in this area are something to be desired. They're nice and all, but I'm still the odd one out, and awkwardly tanned-of-skin. Though I have recently discovered that men of my complexion are in demand... GO ME!!! So here I am. I have sort of settled in with Sarah as my significant room mate once again and working back into sharing my bed with a constant person. I do miss Vegas and California terribly, but I may be able to get into the swing of small town life. I don't think this town will be a permanent situation, but this side of the U.S. holds lots of promising opportunities. and the parties this summer will be absolutely smashing. I don't know how many of you out there in LJ land are associated with theater, but I'm sure you know how us show folks are."

Though I work approximately 80 hours a week, I'm still very satisfied with my job. Most of the people are pleasant. Though the culture shock hasn't warn off yet. This place is still very different from Las Vegas. Last call is at 1am, everything else closes at 9pm and nothing is open on Sundays. I feel a little lost. And for all of you out there that keep in touch via cell phone or letters, I'm not ignoring you. I still love all of you, I'v just been so busy that I barely even have time to shit.

So I takemy own advice and do what it is that I need to do. I get offered this job in Illinois y a friend. The benefits of taking this job are quite acceptable and I send in my resume. I'm almost positive that the job is in the bag, but that means moving quite a bit aways from lots of people and obligations as a maternal figure. Birthdays... Barbeques... Moral and emotional support. 

I have taken my own advice and I am experiencing wonderful me. But, at what cost? Everyone seems proud and happy for me, but, I'm stil not sure if I'm doing the right thing. Taking this job will send me down the career path I've chosen as my trade and it opens the doors for the rest of my career plans, but I feel like I've just abandoned everyone that I really care for.

I pray that everything will be okay and that the fates are giving me a chance. I pray that everything will turn out the way I want them to."

"event","I fly into LAX on Sunday the 15th to go visit some friends in Palm Springs. The visit went well. I arrived, hugged everyone, had Sushi, Dorked it up a bit and everything was merry! then it's time for me to come home on the morning of Wednesday the 18th. I get up, get dressed and out the door about 15 minutes late. The time was 9:45, and my plane was going to board at 12:18, then take of at 12:45... Plenty of time right? HELL NO!!! L.A. from Palm Springs is about 2 hours away. That means that I should be arriving at the terminal at about 11:45 to just in time to grab my E-ticket, step through the metal detectors and onto the plane at about 12:15. That's only if everything would have gone to prefection. But the recipe for my shitty airport experience went something like this... 

Preparation: Take a 1.5 litre bottle of Aquafina and ingest liberally then wait. To begin: Start with some, I was already 15 minutes behind schedule; add in a little, could have gotten out of the car and jogged faster than the damned Oregon drivers crowding the highway; sprinkle a pinch of, finally pulled up to the airport drop off at about 12:05 but couldn't find the fligt number or airline info that I had written down; Fold in a cup of, Finally got my E-ticket after standing in a line for 15 minutes, full of grandiose, yuppy, baby boomers, that didn't know how to work the FAST TICKET terminal. Finally, let set in a security check point line at about 12:25pm. (Now, I'm not sure about the last time any of you guys have flown, but did you know that they make you remove your shoes and belt as well as emptying your pockets now?) When ready to serve the first course, shake vigarously and run with belt and shoes in hand to the furthest flight gate and step aboard the plane at about 12:42, just in time to slip on your belt, slouch your butt between two enormous, smelly and loud rednecks, then silently snicker at the handful of poor boobs that missed the plane, that weren't quite as lucky as you were...

To begin the second course of my experience: Start by getting delayed and taxi around the runway for 45 minutes longer than planned; Then Remind yourself of the mass quantities of liquid you consumed in the preparation stage with a painful urge to urinate and snub that abilty to releive yourself due to the fasten seatbelt sign. Shake vigarously and continue to inhibit relief by adding turbulance and the continuous Fasten seatbelt sign. Continue to shake for 45 minutes while remembering to be agitated by loud smelly (and by this time, very ignorant) rednecks. Let sit for 5 minutes after landing at about 2:35; when ready to serve, let stand for another 5 minutes then rush off to the nearest potty room for releif.

For the final course of my experience;
Preparation: Wander around the baggage claim and passanger pick-up area at about 2:45, muttering and cursing because I can't find my ride home. To begin: we're going to need generous portions of lack of communcation and Fresh, leaving my ass stranded at the airport! Next we're going to measure out and level off me not being able to get a hold of anyone but my vehicleless (and for the most part clueless) mother; Mix these ingredients up with the idea of calling a cab and set aside until proper communications can begin; Now, we're going to take that pre-prepared wandering and add more of wander around the baggage claim/passnager pick-up area, but this time we're going to look suspicious to security, too; Now, let's get pulled in to the back room and given the 3rd degree about what I was doing and where I'm going, etc, etc, etc... Then mix together and let set on a hard plastic bench get released and put on a cab to be taken home in time for me to get to work about an hour late...

Any way, they start hanging out on a regular basis, like going shopping and having a few drinks. Suddenly, she says, he starts making moves on her. She was complaining about how she can't ever find a guy that just wants to hang out. Well here's a news flash and this is what I told her as well, ""It's like the conversation between Harry and Sally. If you put members of the opposite sex in a social situation where they're going to be spending 'Hang out' time alone they cannot just be friends. It will not ever happen! There will always be that underlying lust or infatuation for one or both members of the party. 'Just being friends' does not happen in a prolonged, secluded situation between members of the opposite sex!""

"event","I'm sick! Not just a cold or a simple cough... but out right SICK! You know the drill: cold sweats, aching muscles, constant unproductive coughs that plague your moments of bliss that is sleep. SICK! I had to blow off a movie date in the living room because of it. Angry angry angry! I can't function when I'm sick. I had to stand around at work all day like this and pretend that I was in working order, because like a good portion of the rest of you, I used my sick days on screwing off and hang-overs... Don't tell me that you don't know what I'm talking either. 

Though, all I have to say is, ""May the Gods bless the sweet ambrosia nectar that is known as NyQuil!"" A cup of Theraflu and a shot of the red coma liquid is all it takes to find rest. Sure I slept a bit, but why am I up now only 4 hours since I took the stuff? I have no clue. I'm up and I'm ranting. *sigh* I don't know... I guess I'm up because I have a lot on my mind and not even the comatose, death grip that NyQuil has can't escape my agitation. 

What am I agitated about may you ask? Well... the answer is Drama... lots and lots of drama... I seem to make it for myself all over the place. if I were to write a book about it, it'd read like a smutty, mid-day soap opera. My two favorite supporting characters would constantly be planning the untimely demise of the other, the voice of reason never has anything reasonable to say to the main character, the sage voice of wisdom doesn't know how to apply their own philosophy and the antagonist is the only person that doesn't have emotional instability. Could you imagine the hijinx?

Or perhaps the main problem is that I'm 24, living back at home, putting off school and beating around the bush with with major decisions that would have big life changing impacts. could it be the Nyquil talking? Maybe I'll go back to bed and rest my weary, achy muscles after a nice cup of tea. I can tell I need rest, but I can't be\ring my mind to do it. I can see why people become pot heads and lushes. It just makes it easier to sleep when you need to."

"event","I really worry about this world's future sometimes... Today I asked some kids what they knew about Independence day. You know what they said? ""Ummm.. I think it was a pretty good movie..."" Like I said.. I am frightened... All these stupid parents caught up in political correctness and walking on eggshells about offending other people have made their children spineless ignoramuses. It frustrates me to no end. After I tried explaining the declaration of independence to these fools, they looked more confused then when I said the 4th of July had nothing to do with fireworks. 

Then when I mentioned Thomas Jefferson, one of the idiots finally spoke and tried to throw a little intelligence in for their defense and said, ""Isn't Thomas Jefferson the dude that invented the light bulb?"" Nice try doofus... Yes Jefferson was an inventor and the ""Dude"" that invented the light bulb was named Thomas.. but we're not giving points for the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon... Thank you for playing... (and these fuckin' kids are supposed to be our future defense, world leaders/politicians, parent, teachers and so on and so forth?) 

In udder disgust, I hung my head in shame for the current pre/post-teen generation and banished the messy haired, wannabe skater, pop-punks from the store. These kids have no honor... no self respect or any respect for that matter. Though my biggest gripe about these poor shits is that they have no semblance of the ""playground rules."" None of these damn kids today would last one moment of when I was a kid... molded plastic...seat belt safety.. political corectness... 

All right.. I'm going off on a tangent... It's late.. I'm tired and I need to get up early.. I'll finish this all up later...."

"event","So what about polyamoury? That's been the question on a lot of people's lips. A lot of people have explained it to me as having a close circuit of multiple lovers... and then a few have described it as having affairs with both sexes... I think I get the gist of what it is, but I'm still a little confused as to what the real meaning is, so I looked it up. Please take the time to click the link below.

"event","I have spread my wings and fled the bonds of monogamy. Though now that I have... I don't quite know what to do with myself. Yes I like the idea of being available to any lonely soul that needs a shoulder... a hug... a kiss... comfort sex. The thought is definitely appealing. But, what about the deep yearning or that comfortable person to build experiences with? That person that you spend years getting to know? The quirks that you learn to deal with? What about them? I guess that's the trade off right? Comfort is by no means a reason to stay with a person.

I don't know... It's easy being single. More time, more money, less drama. I kind of miss having someone to share my bed with from time to time, but, I think I'm going to enjoy it for a while before I settle down again."

"event","There's one thing that baffles the hell out of me... and that's these, wannabe health conscious crazy nuts that think that just because you wash down a quarter pounder, large fries, cookies, chicken nuggets and a regular burger with a diet coke, you'll be okay. These people sicken me! What goes through these people's minds? In fact... What the hell is up with all these healthy junk foods? Low carb Hershey's and Coke? Sugar free Red Bull? I think that if you're trying to be conscious about your health, you have no business choking down any of these items. And what kind of miscreants give in to these marketing ploys? It's disturbing how many people believe that just because this junk food that they're swilling on has no carbs, or no sugar that they don't have to worry about their health. Well guess what! Even though these items seem healthier, you still need to get up off your chunky butts and move just a little.

And do me another favor while you're at it. Quit feeding your kids nothing but McDonald's. Cook a God damned meal and eat like a family with the T.V. off from time to time. Then spank your kids when they misbehave. That way, when you decide to bring your A.D.D ridden, socially dysfunctional children into my store, I don't have to threaten to spank you for your bad parenting. I do customer service! Not daycare! I can't wait until I have kids, so that I can teach them to beat the hell out of your misbehaved, maladjusted, misguided and spoiled little shits. People... I swear! Kids don't raise themselves to be bad members of society!"

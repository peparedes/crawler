Okay, I was worried about the break-up, as I was spoiled for it.  But dude, that was a wonderful episode.  Despite the enormous amounts of Ted having sex.  Definitely the only episode of the season so far that I will be watching and re-watching again and again.

Also, I am a freak.  I like it when my OTP are broken up and it's obvious they still have feelings for each other.  I am a drama-slut.  The pain!  The angst!  The longing looks!  The sexual tension!  Some of my favourite scenes from S3 are of Brian and Justin before they got back together (see: the returning of the bracelet, OMG).  Likewise in 507, the last scene.  So awkward.  I hurt.  I love.

The breakup scene was SO GOOD.  Justin being all brave and rational, Brian being all hurt and, ""You're making me fucking nervous"".  It kills me to see Brian so fucked up, but he does it so beautifully. :x

But I think my favourite scene of the whole episode was the Brian/Michael fight.  God, I never thought I'd prefer a B/M scene to a B/J scene (I think it's because the fight is all about B/J, hee).  I thought Hal and Gale really outdone themselves.  You could just feel Brian's anger and pain, and Michael's exasperation.  Michael's ""Who wouldn't?!"" and Brian's reaction to it hurts so good I almost can't take it.  Also, at the beginning of the scene, when Brian says, ""Good, Professor.  You recognize the subject and can identify it by name!"" really cracked me up.
Plus, Angry Brian = OMG SO HOT

Rewind, watch.  Rewind, watch.

Not so fond of the Brandon storyline, but I still have faith.  And Brandon is actually pretty charismatic, I think, though of course he suffers from a comparison to Gale.  Brian calling him, ""Twerp,"" was awesome, though.  Even though Brian pisses me off, I still want him to win.  Sigh.

I'm really looking forward to 508.  :x

ETA:  The song!  I forgot to mention the song in the end credits!  Brilliant, brilliant choice.  I don't know if I've said this before, but whoever picks the music for QAF is my own personal Jesus."

"event","I was going to be a spoiler virgin for QAF season 5.  Uh, yeah, that didn't exactly work out.

But this is where I'm drawing the line!  No watching screeners, no reading exact dialog!  This spoiler-whoring has to stop.

I read Keira's Big Spoiler Post.  Oh, Fandom.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for big Season 5 Spoilers"">

Oh my god, people, take a Xanax and relax!  Maybe I'm just an optimist, but I'm rather happy with the ending.    I think a wedding would have been way too much.  My only peeve is that it is kind of cruel to the fans to dangle a wedding and then turn the tables at the last minute.  I'm kind of relieved I know what will happen in advance.

I'm particularly bemused at people who moan about wasting the past years of this life to this show.  Uh, what?  I imagine that they are exaggerating because I doubt that QaF was anyone's ENTIRE LIFE.  But even if it was, if you enjoyed being in the fandom while you were, how did you waste your time?  Why should it matter how it ends?

Also, I'm so sick of people bitching at Justin, it gives me hives.  I adore Brian, but I tend to defend Justin.  Because I love him, but also because the whole fandom worships the ground Brian walks on, and Justin constantly gets bitched at every time he does something that Brian might not agree with.  Justin is a person, you know.  A very young person with feelings and neuroses and fears and hopes, JUST LIKE BRIAN IS.  And I wonder about all those who condemn Justin for leaving, did they read what comes before the whole 'Marry me' thing?  Brian is an asshole to Justin through most of the season.  When Justin leaves, Brian does nothing (that I know of) to try to get him back, and if it wasn't for the Babylon bomb incident, maybe he never would have done anything -- which makes me want to smack him so hard.

So anyway, what I'm trying to say (not very eloquently) is that I completely understand the whole 'Justin leaves' because, honestly, staying in Pittsburgh?  When you're on the edge of success?  Brian was right in encouraging him to go.  Imagine the building resentment if he had stayed (""I gave up my whole career for you!"").

But that doesn't mean I'm not crossing my fingers for Brian to decide to follow him to NYC at the last minute.  And if not, well, I fully expect many a good fanfic where he does."

And I'm sure it's been discussed before, but they are totally <lj-cut text=""ripping off QAF"">ripping off QAF.

Come on.  Two characters who are considered as rivals for the affections of a third person.  These two rivals get together to make an autobiographical comic book about their lives and friends.  Hmm, where have I see this storyline before?

Ok, so:
Zach=Michael
Seth=Justin,

...and best of all, Summer=Brian.


Oh my god.  Summer=Brian.  I'm going to be obsessed with this idea all week.  THEY ARE SO THE SAME PERSON, ONLY ONE IS A 17 YEAR OLD STRAIGHT GIRL AND THE OTHER A 31 YEAR OLD GAY MAN!

Let's see:
1)they are both really hot
2)they are both label queens
3)they are both rich
4)they are both bitchy

...and, er, I'm running out of examples.

But now I totally want to see them go out shopping together, and mock other people's bad taste."

"event","I really want to stay relatively Spoiler-Free for QAF S5.  I already know enough.   I enjoyed the latter half of S4 a lot more than the first half, which I mostly believe to be related to the fact that I didn't know anything about them, after being ridiculously spoiled for episodes 401 to like 409.  And the end of the season had so little B/J!

But it's SO HARD!  All those cut-tags are killing me.  I don't want to abandon this journal because I'd miss out on fic, and OMG WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT FIC?  There's no way I'll be able to resist until the premiere.  It's so far away. :((("

I'm still in awe that professional rugby players from a major team would be willing to be so blatantly homoerotic.  Gotta love the French.  And gotta love rugby.

I figure if I want to watch Spanish TV, I might as well watch something I know already so I don't get frustrated that I can't understand everything.  As it is, I get about a third of what's being said, but it's good practice and I find it entertaining.

Spanish Brian has the most ridiculous voice ever.  Actually, they all do (except Michael, who weirdly sort of sounds like his English self) -- but Brian's... it's just too much.

Watching 305 right now:  ""No hay nada noble en ser pobre.""  Oh, Brian.  You'll change your mind by the end of the season."

Although my lover lives
In a place that I can't live
I kind of find I like a life
This lonely
It rips and pierces me

I love dissatisfied
I love to feel there's always more that I need

You're where you want to be
I'm where I want to be
Come on we're chasing
everything we've ever wanted
I replace you easily
Replace pathetically
I flirt with every flighty thing
that falls my way
But how I needed you
When I needed you
Let's not forget
We are so strong
So bloody strong

Come on home
So come on home
So come on home

Blue light falls
Upon your perfect skin
Falls and you draw back again
Palls and this is how I fell
I cannot forget
I cannot forget
Come on home
come on home
But don't forget to leave"

Man, I had such a blast.  Drag Queens (including the infamous Mado Lamotte, whom I want to be when I grow up), strippers, half-naked boys, half-naked girls, loads of good music, loads of dancing, and <i>loads</i> of drinking in bars and outdoors concerts.  I flirted with some hot girls.  I easily got rid of some annoying guy who was being a bit too affectionate by telling him I was only into women (which, sadly, isn't true). I wish it was Pride Weekend every weekend.    

I need to make some local gay (or gay-friendly) friends so I have people to party with in the Village more often.  All my queer buddies are out-of-towners and now they're all gone, back to their small towns far away from Fabulous Montreal.

During the parade, I spent like three hours checking out guys and trying to decide if Brian would fuck them or not.  Yeah.  You know you need to get a life when you spend your time picking out casual sex partners for a fictional character.  I'm so pathetic."

It's just, GOD, it makes me want to scream sometimes.  Are these people on <i>crack</i>?

So I loved 4.14.  Hysterically.  Between Brian hallucinating Justin on the side of the road, the wedding cake, the 12-step meeting with the cows, and OMFG, Brian asking Justin to move in with him, I was a mess. <i>""I've been waiting for you to ask me that since the first time you brought be here.""</i>  Oh Tiny Justin!  The love!

But then I go and read some threads on <lj user=""queerasfolkfans""> because I'm bored and still high on the finale and can't think of going to sleep just yet.  Yes, I know.  I should have just picked up a book instead.

But anyway, there's this discussion about how people can't understand why Justin lets Brian lead his life for him, how Justin isn't his own person and obviously is very stupid because he'll give up his career to live with Brian.  And then, complaints about how Justin is weak and can't think for himself.

*FROTHS AT THE MOUTH*

This coming from B/Mers!  Don't get me wrong, I love me some Mikey, and I love his relationship with Brian, but you think <i>JUSTIN</i> lets Brian lead him around?!  Hi, have you met Michael Novotny?  Granted, little Mikey has made huge steps to improve himself, but come on.  This is the person who was basically at Brian's beck and call for half his life.  He was the poster boy for codependency.

And how can you even say that Justin can't think for himself?  HE'S MY TINY JUSTIN AND HE'S SO BRAVE!  God, I can't even begin to list the number of times he's deliberately done things that Brian didn't agree with.  Hello, Dancer at Babylon?  Political Activist Poster Boy?  Vigilante Gang Member?

People need to stop hating Justin.  Justin-Hate makes me angry.  And I need to stop reading posts that are clearly titled 'thoughts from a non B/J fan'."

But I'm not a Brian/Michael shipper and will never be.  And besides, the lyric ""Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance floor, Michael you're dancing like a beautiful dance whore,"" is really kind of laughable.  Yeah, I like Michael.  He can be cute.  But he's no 'beautiful dance whore'.

So much fic, so little time!  My life is taking a turn for the ridiculously busy.  I'll have to catch up over the weekend."

"event","I'm a poor university student.  I do not have cable because that seems rather unecessary, as opposed to, say, eating.  Yet I am seriously considering tweaking my budget and subscribe to cable TV for a couple of months -- just so I can watch season four of QaF.  Bad girl!

I mean, I figure I could download the episodes.  But usually it takes a couple of days before I can find them online.  Plus, quality is an issue, and I have that TV sitting there doing nothing...  Oh, QaF, why must you tempt me so?  The really silly part of this story is that I had Showcase fo four years when I was doing my undergrad, and I only started watching QaF last summer.  I had access to it all that time and didn't know!

Then again, it's probably better that way.  I didn't need another obsession at that time.  Hell, I don't need one now.  But in the words of the great god Kinney, ""It's too late now.  There's no turning back.""

I've got to get to bed.  I've got shitloads of work to do tomorrow, and hitting 'refresh' on my friends list and on bjfic.net (why do I bother?) isn't doing me any good."

"event","I'm kind of pissed at the makers of QaF for putting Cure's 'Lovesong' in the scene where Justin and Ethan have sex for the first time.  Because, damnit, that's one of my favourite Cure songs, and it would be such a <i>perfect</i> B/J song, if it hadn't been soiled by Justin/Ethan sex.  Somebody should make a B/J vid with that song to reclaim it for the OTP!  I would, if I knew anything about about vidding.

<i>
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

How ever far away
I will always love you
How ever long I stay
I will always love you
What ever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you

Fly to the moon

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

How ever far away
I will always love you
How ever long I stay
I will always love you
What ever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you</i>

Also, <i>Lovecats</i> would make a fabulous B/J vid.  And <i>Mint Car</i>. Christ.

I'm a music obsessive.  It's true.  I buy more CDs than I can afford, I attend more gigs than I have time for, I buy music magazines and read band biographies and I develop huge crushes on musicians.  I collect setlists and autographs from the concerts I attend.  I have more band t-shirts than any othet type of clothing. My brain is full of useless knowledge about my favourite bands.  Whenever I'm bored in class, I scribble lyrics of my favourite songs in my notebooks.  I've even been known to write rockslash.

Seeing as I'm also a QaF obsessive, it's only natural that I spend a lot of time daydreaming (in class, on the subway in the morning, while doing the dishes, in the shower...), and making up vids in my head.  I have a dozen songs in mind already that I'd love to turn into vids.  Mostly B/J, sometimes just B, sometimes just J, and even a gen vid or two.  It's kind of pathetic, really.

But I think it's a good thing I don't know how to make them because then I'd probably spend all my time doing that, and my thesis would be forgotten.  I already spend too much time in fandom as it is!

Grad students who are trying to finish research proposals shouldn't be allowed anywhere near QaF."

"event","I don't know if I'm hallucinating this, but I'm pretty sure that I've read a number of B/J fics (of varying quality) featuring Justin finding out that Brian had bought the drawing of him (from the art show episode in S1), and Justin being all ""OMG, Brian bought it, he loves me so much, all this time and I never knew he had it!""

And I was just watching 110 (further proof that I have no life), when Justin is giving Daphne a tour of the loft, and Brian is all grumpy and 'Yo, bitch, pour me some guava juice', right?  And I noticed that the drawing is there, in the background of Brian's room.  I actually paused and rewinded a few times to be sure.  So there you go!  Justin's Naked Brian drawing, in full view for all to see.  So it definitely wasn't hiding in the back of Brian's wardrobe.  Well, not after 110, anyway.

Also, that episode reminded me of my hate for Dr. David, and my confusion at all of Michael's entourage going 'you should totally move in with him!'  Are these people <i>blind</i>?  I'm so glad he's gone.  And I have lots and lots of love for Ben.

In other news, I live in a building full of crazy people.  And not crazy in a good way.  There's this couple having a fight across the hall right now, and I really don't need to hear any more of that woman screaming ""Mon osti de gros chien sale!""  And when it's not my upstairs neighbor singing in his bath, or the next door guy listening to wrestling at obscene volumes, it's the downstairs couple having lots of loud sex.

I really need to get out of this shithole."

"event","So, first entry in my all-new, all-fangirly LJ.  I probably won't be posting a whole lot here, because honestly, I'm all about reading the fic and so far not so much about writing it.

So anyway, I was watching 214 today.  What's not to love about that episode?  It has toppy!Justin, and the scene in the Jeep when Michael, Ted and Brian get arrested still makes me laugh out loud, even after watching it like a hundred times.  ""Little Mikey's jealous!""  And ""Officer, I would be more than happy to drive these two gentlemen home,"" while falling all over himself.  Oh Gale, I love thee.

Also, is it wrong that I think that a hungover, spent-the-night-in-jail Brian is unbearably hot?  I could watch him sprawled on that bench, clutching the metal bars all day long.  And I'd probably need a bib."

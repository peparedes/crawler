"event","i am so hungry and bored at the moment...  So I'll record some cheery (or just random) stuff into my journal.  HURRAH!!!  Stream of consciousness from Lauren, what could be better?  Anyway, as I said, I'm hungry, and I really want to eat but it's still only 5:16.  I have to wait a half an hour.  Then steak!!  Hopefully good cause it may be bad.  If bad, i will come back and eat like a crazy vegan- 2nd supper or somethin like that, just like i had brunch in two places this morning- FUN!  so, YEAH!  I think I am crazy cause my schedule is insane.  I didn't plan on auditioning for choir, but somehow it just happened, so I'm in chorus, and then i didn't plan on audiitoning for chamber chorus, but deanna was just like you should audition for chamber chorus!!  So i was like, ok, I have nothing better to do, but that makes my schedule chock full, esp since I haven't scheduled my equitation classes yet.  I still want to be in chambers cause it would be fun- pretty music from all over the world, and I have so missed being in choir!  I have already learned so much so hopefully both choirs will be an extremely enriching experience!  And if I die from exhaustion, who cares for I shall die fulfilled!!! hahahaha!!!!!  Anyway, I won't die, cause i'll just decide not to do some work if i need to and still do well in everything and be just dandy.  But, i need to be more ambitious, and actually try, and study, and all that crap cause i need to get into vet school!!  Cornell here i come, hopefully.  I've already planned out my schedule so that i cna have all my requirements done and apply my soph year! SCORE!!  Now I just need to execute this master plan and be one of the select few to be accepted, HURRAH!!  But, that means work, but then I could just relax and go abroad and not worry about such things junior and senior year.  That sounds like fun.  I'm not an ambitious person, typically, I don't care about competition, cause who cares, but i really will try hard to get into cornell!!  ANd it's fun to be ambitious about this!!  So anyway, i'm no longer trying out for a cappella this year : (  But next year I'm all over it!!!  YEAH!!!!!!  OK, I've wasted exactly ten minutes with this nothingness.  Let's see if I can waste some more time.  Oh no!!  I'm getting lightheaded at the lap top!!  i shall put my head on the keyboard and see what letters come out!  yh  ONLY 2!!!!!!  Oh well, y and h must mean something.  Like tea leaves or soemthing.or, it could just be a shortened version of....  wait for it... <br><br><br>YEAH!!!

The people who did this to Zanzi are absolutely disgusting.  How can anyone completely neglect such a beautiful animal?  
Here's a pic of her  before, when she just got off the truck from Canada.  She came at the same time as my horse Fjona. She was a PMU rescue who wasn't bred.  The stupid people bred this poor mangy, pestilence filled, emaciated mare!!!!!!!

I went out to the coop this afternoon and heard cheeping =D. Rainbow
has been sitting on eggs for about 26 days. Duck eggs take 35 days to
hatch, so i was surorised. When I looked under her, I found a chick!!!
One of those sneaky chickens laid an egg, even though we *thought* we
had taken all of the chicken eggs out. OH well, so I am handraising

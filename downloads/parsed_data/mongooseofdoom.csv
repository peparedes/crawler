"event","So yay for weekend fast approaching, nay for Calc exam tuesday, and yay for paintballing. I hope that last one's a yay at least. I'm all for paintballing online (Quake), but if this kind is going to turn into udayan-threshing...NO. At least it's another excuse to visit Davis again, which I thoroughly enjoyed last weekend. Dex and the closet hospitality made me a stronger person, resistant to as many gay jokes as you can dish out. If you smile at a boy, tell them you're from Frisco, you guarantee yourself problems. Oh well, I've changed to hometown San Mateo as Lynn requested..so YAY. 

I'm so confused as to why I'm not tired right now. I was zombieboy like two hours ago..GRRRR how come this shit never happens when I need it to. Let me see what Spring is like."

"event","Wahooo for pushing myself to go to Calc. Cutie professor wasn't there but we had a decent substitute. When it's my favorite professor you're substituting for, you better bring the goods nah mean sucka. You could see the entire class become hostile toward her as she entered and starting giving us handouts, but a few inside jokes and she was quickly on our side. I almost snapped at her for asking why I was doing my notes instead of the assignment, but I keep forgetting this is college. IT AIN'T NONE OF HER DAMN BIZNEZ. I remember those traumatic days in the library where the mass-copying was a covert operation and we always had to tell the librarians that we were here on a field trip and it would be over shortly (actually, that was mine. what was yours? please post!)"

"event","weeeeee, i have quite a bit of work to do for english + calc, but i have time. i'll say the exact same thing 2 hours before everything is due so why does it matter when I say it? hey look jonbaby has connected wassaup ooops wrong window. I had a conversation with Dexter just now, and he brought something up that I've been feeling pretty strongly about. When we were all back at Carlmont, I think we became so close that it pretty much solidified us as great friends. I remember when I first moved in to the dorms and made friends, I was thinking how I could ever feel comfortable with these people. it's homesickness + my destitute social capabilities BUT i'm slowly getting over it. thank you college (it's a life skill I needed to acquire sooner or later). I was won-won-won-won-wondering about you. I love Jennifer Louise. I need to do laundry, but I'm lazy. Sleeping in did not help me one bit, i missed history again. I should have used that time to clean this place up. I Sux0r. JEEEENIIIFER LOUISE YOU DONT KNOW ME BUT WERE COUSINSSSSS."

"event","I feel perfectly normal if I don't move anything except my fingers, BUT DAMN. Yesterday was SUPPOSED to be recreational soccer with a group of guys/gals from the dorms WTF DOESN'T THAT MEAN PRACTICE IS CHEATING? Tom and I show up and see the opposing Team to Beat (bad name choice if you lose) practicing bicycle kicks and penalty shots? Not cool, since I hadn't played soccer since September up till that point. I also don't like how ""wear blue"" for your jersey was motivation for the other team to go to kinko's or something and have custom ones made. I think you see where this is leading -> we got owned. Well actually not that badly, and I set up our only goal! I don't think I stretched out properly because I currently have no movement in my lower body and I roll to all my destinations or inch forward (the sac state tortoise almost beat me to calc, I hustled to save myself from further embarrassment). Did I mention my internet works now?

WAH WAH WAHHHHHHHHHH I have my compsci exam on wednesday of next week, but the good news is it's only 4 questions. or is that the bad news? not too sure but I have the frown-upsidedown capability so it's good. and this searing pain through my legs? it's just because i'm lovestruck RIIIGHT. 

OH OH OH and bloc party hasn't scheduled their may SHOW!??!?! WTF it's ok me still <3. ok pain getting to head must /quit"

"event","Well Well Well, what have we here? Anyways, this day has been forever....... and a day. 
I woke up at like 6:30 for no apparent reason. Well, I guess it was a good thing because I have had to do so much cleaning. You see, on saturday my mom hurt her foot, so today she went to the doctors and found out that she broke it! So she isnt supposed to do much, therefore I pretty much have to do it all. Its not that big of a deal, but I feel all grown up. Well, actually not really me and my brother had to go to the store for my mom and shoot we couldnt find anything we had to call her like 5 times.
Good thing the day is going to end soon. Another reason it probably took so long is because I cant wait for tomorrow. Im going to one of my favorite places on earth(No its not Disneyland)SIX FLAGS!!!! man I love that place. 
Well good bye"

I think it will be alot of fun. And also because it is spring break, but the bad part is I will be gone during my whole week off. oh well it is worth it I think. I hope!
Anyways today at school I had to give this speech thing, I was kind of nervous about it but it was alright after I got up there, Im just glad I got it done and out of the way!!!
That is about all that has been happening at school, well besides stupid teachers putting a tone of stress on you all the time. Well that is about all I have to write about so that is all for now.

"event","well as you have probably read in other peoples journal, I went to fine arts this weekend! It was alot of fun. I competed in 5 things, 2 bands, a small human video, a large human video, and a large drama. so now that you know what I did I will tell you how it started. On friday I didnt go to school at all, then at about 12 we left the church. We probably arrived at the hotel at about 2 or so. Then we were all bored so we made this hilarious movie. Then it was time to go to the church. Once we got to the church, I started feeling a bit nervous because for our drama we had to perform I had to memorize this verse and I was so scared that I would forget it! And the fact that our band was performing the song that I was the most nervous about first. But it was cool. 
Then the next day. First I had to  do my small human video, Then after along time and after lunch we did our christan band song. Right after we did our large human video. Then it was time for them to announce the winners. Our large drama made it to the next round so during summer we will be going to Texas!!! It wasnt till after that it hit all of us that we made it! then we were all going crazy, it was fun. then we came home,and I went to church yesterday. well stay tuned for next times broadcast!"

"event","Hello everyone! well, I havent wrote in this for awhile because of a couple af reasons. 
 First reason- are stupid computer wasnt working

 Second reason- I went to Arizona for a funeral
so now I will tell you what I have been doin. On Tuesday, it was my moms birthday so my family went out for breakfast. Then we came home and packed and we were on the road to good old Phoenix! (We were staying with the man whos wife died.) That night, me and keith watched black hawk down. It was a good movie!! Then the following day was the funeral so that was a little depressing. But it was much better after, beacause we went shopping!! Then on Thurs. morning we left. It was an alright trip but it was well worth missing school! Unfortunately I had to go to school today, but it was okay! In language arts we had this hilarious sub! It was so much fun. Tonight I went to Jr. high night, and now I am at home 
           much love, LaRanda"

"event","Hello, well i would up-date you about everything since the last time I wrote, but its just the same old stuff, so I will just tell about my day!! OK, well today I was in a wedding. IT was for Micheal & Erica, they are both good friends of my family and we have known them for a really long time. Anyway, I had to get up early to go get my nails done, then I had to go get my hair done. By that time it was almost time or me to be at the church so I got ready and went. Then we were there for like 2 and half hours before the wedding started taking pictures and doing all that nonsense.  Then it was the wedding and me and Heidi were the candle lighters (I know, I know, not a big part, but hey I'll take what I can get). Then after the wedding the reception was at the Wheel house, and so we were there for another 4 hours.We got to see some old friends of ours so that was really cool too!!
all in all it was a very nice wedding. Now I am tired so i am go to bed."

"event","Well, I have wrote in this for a couple days! I will say all the things I have done since saturday -k- ok here it goes! On Sunday i went to the church a little bit early and prayed with some other people, and then it turned into this big long service thing. It was pretty cool. Then the rest of the day i pretty much slept and went back to church. On Monday, me and Heidi had to go to the school early to earn off our strikes from asb. It is really boring to. So then I just had a pretty normal day. Tuesday was the same I went early and had another normal day. Wednesday the same thing. Then I went to church and del taco after it was pretty cool. And today surprisingly I didn't go early but I did have a normal day. Wow I have a very repetitive life. Well, school is kind of stressful right now because Im stupid and don't get anything in math at all. But other then that all is well. So I think I covered most of it, well the boring part at least!! Ok bye bye

"event","hello! yesterday i didnt get the chance to write in this because i went to see the movie ""The passion of the Christ""! it started at 10:30 so i didnt get home till 12:30, almost 1 or so. it was a good movie. but it is hard to explain it. you kind of have to watch it to understand it because although it is a good movie it is bad in the same sense. and it is a very sad movie but yet at the same time it was a very happy movie because as you know with out all that stuff happening to christ, we wouldnt be here. ok now i sound like my dad! anyway, it was scary to half the movie i was closing my eyes and covering my ears,(i cant handle that kind of stuff). now, about my day today. i was very tired so i skipped first period because it was only p.e. and since it was raining i figured it was ok to miss. but then i had to go for L.A. and so now i am at home being bored so that is why i am writing in this. ok well thats about all for today. adios amigos!

"event","i was in the office last night. shopping around on Second Life when Sir calls me on the intercom.

""I want you to bring Me a tea, take a shower, draw me a bath and light some candles.""

i knew what that meant and a smile came on my face. Sir was about to play with His girl.

When i brought Him His tea He also demand that once he was in the bath, i should not only light the candle but prepare the toys, lay on the bed and relax.

i was excited.

i took the floggers out, lay them nicely on the dresser, next to the nipple clamp, and while He doesn't use it because of practical reason and also because i am too new, i took the single tail out. When i took the paddle out my skin tingled with anticipation. i was already slightly aroused.

Didn't really go as i imagined.

When Sir came out of the bath He explained it would be a short but intense session, to test my limits.

O/our bedroom is quite cluttered so having the ""right"" position to do this is not an easy task. He asked me to sit on the middle of the bed, facing the wall.

i do have physical limits, medical one. i have artritis and back issues too. i knew i wouldn't be able to keep that position for too long but Lord I did not know it would be that short.

While testing the position i received a hard flogger blow on my nape. That was not a good way to start, i tensed up right away. In the few minutes following i received a hard blow on my shoulder blade followed by one (it was an accident) on my ear/side of the head. i saw stars there...

i know Sir didn't do this on purpose, He never meant to hit me there and knows that is a dangerous area but the position i was and He was in made him hard for Him to aim well.

I did use my safeword then, the pain on my head was too much to handle. i hesitated to stop completely at this point as i knew my mind was not in at all. i would have been smarter to stop but i decided to continue.

Sir massaged me a while, He knew my back was aching from the position i was in. He then had me laying on my stomach and continued with flogging. i did have to use my safeword again, he was testing my limit afterall. The paddle followed and i am surprised how long i was able to endure it.

Because W/we were testing my limits and trust me those limits were tested, i was not turned on at all, i was tired but not turned on. i was not floating either. It was intense alright.

It's hard to put feeling and emotions on this, i see it more like an experimentation then something i should feel..."

"event","Being new in the lifestyle is like a new corset, it requires a period of adjustment. 

Sir Tzer and i had a long talk last night about my previous entry and He agreed that if pinching my nipples trigger something but nothing will follow that act, it is a cruel thing to do to girl.

i explained my position and compared it when He first moved here.. He wanted to see everything and do everything at the same time but eventually Newfoundland stopped being a novelty and He didn't need to cross in the middle of the street to go see the amazing store He never seen before. He understood my position towards the lifestyle and that every time He mentions an aspect of it, my mind start racing towards : ""i can't wait to try it.""

Also having such bad experience in my past and my long period of chastity, i have much to discover in my sexuality.

Glad that became clear now."

"event","It might just be frustration that is making me write this but i sadly see a pattern here. 

Long before i became a girl this situation did appear to be a bad habit where One makes insinuation that playtime will happen today but yet another day in chastity just passed by.

Yesterday was the same and today will be also. Although no words of playtime was given today but looks in innuendos were, yet its pass 11pm and W/we had a long and busy day therefore Sir will soon hit the sack...

i hate this. i have so much to explore and have been so horny in the last few days. Heck, since W/we bought the nipple clamp and Sir made me try it, I have been as wet has a hot summer night. W/we bought a new toy, assisted to a meeting where a girl had a scene done on her by multiple people including Sir, got my nipple played with more then the dog went out for a leak and i am expected to stay a good girl. not touch myself and keep my mouth shut.

i will do just that but it does reflect on my mood and i am unable to hide my feelings, my face is an open book. i am so confused on what i feel at this moment. i feel angry, fooled, rejected, used but not appreciated. Tears started coming down my face as soon has i hung up the intercom phone. When You called, i was hoping You'd order me to prepare myself but it was to ask something so irrelevant and futile, i felt embarrassed, almost humiliated.

i am discovering my sexuality with You, i have put this in Your hands and yet it seems so unimportant to You.

i hate this, i hate myself for needing and wanting this. i hate hoping, it leads to deceptions...

"event","i have just finished viola johnson's book that Sir Tzer asked me to read. Reading through the years of the Leather Community is an historical route i believe every sub should take by reading her story.

The will power behind this woman impress me beyond words. She had the will, the patience to fulfill the dream she had and never lost hope nor respect for the lifestyle she had chosen.

i wish i had that..."

"event","When i first started ""dating"" Sir Tzer i knew He was in this lifestyle but didn't know much about it beside the preconceived idea about it, i even remembered having one hell of a fit when He came back from Kink i threw a fit about the scene He had. At that point He was still bottom.

In time, i learned more about the lifestyle and started experience with being a girl in Second Life. i was a virtual sub for Sir Tzer, collared and all but it was in a virtual world, not in Real Life. i could not picture being a sub for real, being so opiniated and having the temper of a hot summer night tsunami on PMS....&nbsp; O/our life was pretty much vanilla.

i admit i was curious about it and recently my curiosity became more intense. When Sir Tzer decided to take another sub in Second Life, since I decided to let that role go, and at first was okay with it until i saw her kneeling at His feet. I lost it. No one should adore Him the same way i do.

i was never a fan of pain however i did much enjoy when He played, tug, twisted and pinched my nipple. That realized made me think i might enjoy pain more then i could ever begin to imagine.&nbsp; i then asked Sir Tzer to do a scene with me.

It might have been nothing for a lot of lifestyler out there but for me, it was the best thing i ever been through. The pain was more the bearable, it was fueling, empowering even.

Taking into consideration the way i reacted, Sir Tzer decided to explain why i would be a good sub and not a Domme as i imagined...

The decision was made, i would give it a try and serve the man i love the most.

i have to admit i am afraid to be in this for the kink of the pain and i am afraid that my egoistical side might not be able to make it but W/we will see i guess...."

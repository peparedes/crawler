"event","i'm so sick and tired of being a stupid loser. well i guess i'm being punished. i don't deserve anyone. men must look at me and think i'm one stupid female dog. well i'm used to being alone. would someone tell me why i'm so ugly and what is wrong with me. I can never figure out why men don't want to date me or ever ask me to be their gf"

"event","well Hopefully this will be a better year for me in the love department. i hope i will find a guy for a friend and maybe more if i'm lucky. why do guys like to screw with your heart and they leave u with a poisioned mind. and every time a guy comes along, i can't feel that i can trust them. it totally sucks ass. i hope that girls who have loving bf's never have to go thru the pain and deal with a man's stupidpity,being a jerk, suffering male PMS,  men will never know what it's like for a woman to deal with it every month, and they are creeped out when u even mention the word tampon. i don't get it. If women didn't have them men would not be born. it a natural thing but some men are wimps when it come down to personal matters, for example ""commiment"" they are very scared of the word for some reson. it not like women ask to get married on the first date. so guys should stop being  sorry saps and get some balls to tell women how they really feel about them. well i think i'm done for now ."

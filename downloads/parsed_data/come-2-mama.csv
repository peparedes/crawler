today my wife made really shitty waffles so i got sooo fuckin angry and upset and emo so i died my hair black I and then i chucked my son at my new plasma wide screen tv and made a giant bonfire in my front lawn and burned all my clothing while screaming the lyrics to ""the rules"" by ben kweller. my gay ass neighbor, mrs. nancy (but since today i like to call her 'mrs. nazicrotch' hahaha) told me to put the fire out, it was scaring her lips. so, i was like ""pssh fine i'll put it out"" so i took a glass of water and poured it onto the giant fire and it didn't go out so i was like, ""whoops! the fire didnt go out! i guess you can go home now!"" and mrs. nancy was like ""ok...""  and she scampered home and i stayed there on my lawn staring at the clouds go by until the sun went down and it started to rain, and my fire went out."

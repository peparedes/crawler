Maybe I should fill y'all in a the happenings?

mathletes have a full lineup and we are going to Minneapolis on Aug 23rd for 16 days to do a record. we're working with producer Jordan Schmidt (sing it loud, all time low, morning light, jamestown story) and basically, we're going to be your new favorite band...

...or maybe your kid sister's favorite band.

I'm really excited about this. It's nice to have something to look forward to for once. Greg will not be joining Chris, Ryan, Brian, and I in the studio and Ryan has to leave after a week, so only me, Chris and Brian will be there for the entire recording process. We will be making a little youtube video while we are up there aside from partying, exploring sex world, and roller blading through mall of america in our ducks jerseys.

This friday Ryan is joining Chris and I at Milwaukee's warped tour and I would be lying if I said I wasn't stoked. I'm going to go broke.

Aside from this happening this summer has been pretty uneventful. I haven't really kicked it with anyone I thought I would. I guess people got shit to do. Also, females be buggin'! Get it together.

I went to soul veg yesterday with faggy Ryan and we ate too much. I feel gross. I talked basketball with a cool dude on the red line and fell in love with a black girl. Too bad I was talking to the dude..."

"event","I am nervous and restless like a motherfucker. 
I don't really know why. I end up laying in bed awake all night not really thinking about much at all. I need to start sedating myself in order to sleep.
I hope good things are around the corner for me. I think I need to do something big. Something that is very unlike classic me. I need to shock myself. Perhaps, I will feel better.

Last night Chris and I sat around working on the best song ever written. I will just leave it at that. 

Saturday is ROH. PUMPED.

School is shitty but it has its moments. I don't really think I've done any actural work yet. How I manage to get great grades is beyond me. I really could give a stroke about any of this.

I've had throwing bricks by Ceremony in my head all fucking morning.

I'm going to throw this fucking bottle as hard as I can, hope it hits you in the teeth and make you learn your lesson. 
It's dog eat dog in a place like this. 
This hard luck life sucks so I use my fists. 
I've got a chip on my shoulder. 
I'm on a losing streak. 
There's a cloud of contempt hanging over me, because it's dog eat dog in a place like this. 
Every man for himself so I use...

met some alright people thus far, but i think i have enough friends at this point. 

school is a bore...let's move along.

been thinking more and more about when i finally went to leave this city. sooner rather than later  i hope. i need to get my act together and make a big change. i feel like everything around me is just an attempt by others to hold me back. i guess it's a really paranoid way of looking at things, but it's how i feel. 

been feeling different lately. 2008 has been CRAZY so far. honestly kids, i wish i could blow my load all over you all and spill the beans about the latest haps of Mr. Lange...but i'll save that for another time.

nights of no sleep and time with friends. sitting around eating cereal with chris and watching curb your enthusiasm.

my bronchitis is back this winter and it's brutal. mainly because i had the flu last month, so now my lungs feel like they are about to collapse every time i take a breath. 

brian mailed the british office to my house for my birthday. that was really nice of him. i am seeing that brown d00d tomorrow.

wish i got to see everyone once more before they headed back to their schools and veronica before she goes to rome.

in other news, the sand doom beach gang video on youtube will be at 10,000 plays in a week. that is really fucking crazy and i can't understand it one bit. 

well, i am going to go take a shower, listen to some testament, and kick it with chris and black ass tim on the couch for a while."

"event","I am on lunch right now at work. I am pretty tired.

When I get home I have to start getting things ready for when we shoot Saturday morning. Hopefully I can squeeze a nap in real quick. Brian is coming in later tonight, so we can get the ball rollin' bright and early.

Saturday will be a big day. Sunday requires an additional location, but hopefully the day will be a little more relaxed after Saturday is wrapped up. 

All I know is that I will get my drink on tonight on my porch whilst listening to crooked fingers.

After this weekend we will have literally half a dozen scenes left to shoot. FINALLY!

The 2 dinner scenes at Brian's parents house, a couple scenes of me at Kristine's apt, a couple of scenes of Will at his computer, A PEE-PEE SCENE, and the most difficult scene of them all...duh duh dunnnn...THE GREEN SCREEN scene with Cuauh. 

Most of that shit is in later episodes anyway. The first couple can be uploaded without a problem. I can't even remember how many TOTAL scenes there are in all 6 LOL episodes. If I had to guess I would say somewhere between a shit ton and too fucking many.

After this is completed, don't expect nothing from the 4 of us for a while. We might do something small like the Cummy Larry bit or the Furious Wiener featuring yours truly as the Furious One. I still have the rough draft of Ep 1 sitting around at home where there is a shaving accident and a nipple tainted with HIV positive blood ends up in Furious' cereal!

I can't wait to see my friends this weekend.

To everyone I haven't seen, I apologize. I told everyone that this would happen. Spreading myself thin as hell, Jack. I still want another person for a super fun role on Sunday. If anyone is down, they should holler at any of us. Otherwise, we will just have someone shemp it."

Their only concern is my level of pay at this point. They feel it is too high and he doesn't know what kind of raise he could give with the position at this point. I told dude flat out. I was all, ""dude, I don't need a raise. I'll take the job and worry about money in 6 months."" Honestly, I will be making MORE money anyway because the Supplement department has a huge labor payout whole we get the shaft in grocery.

The point of the potential job change in a month is that I get to sleep in. No more 6 AM or 5 AM shifts. I would work 9-5 everyday and have weekends off. Every weekend off. Sweet cream dick lick!

Land of Lincoln is at the 75% mark right now, which is cool. I just want to move on already. I am not saying that I am tired of it, it's still fun.

TWO NIGHTS!

EMPTY BOTTLE
Boris & Michio Kurihara

Man, I will do every single drug on the planet before, during, and after these shows. I am pretty stoked taht Boris has a split with Doomriders coming out soon.

So this weekend we are going to be angry and over-worked with the Land of Lincoln. i work tomorrow morning and from there I will be joining the crew to get some exterior shots done at the park near my house. I hope everything goes as planned and by the time I arrive there is a good chunk of footage in the can. I can say do some lines, spit my rhymes, and straight bounce. From there we are going over to David's. He was nice enough to let us use his house WHILE he is away for the weekend. That is the nicest thing ever. Too bad I am going to jerk off on everything there. Including my friends...as long as they get in my way. Major cummage, daddy.

I am really nervous. Actually, nervous isn't the right word. Scared. Yes, scared is more appropriate. I am scared that everything will go wrong and we won't get a thing done and everyone involved will go back to their colleges before we are completed. We really took on a large task when you think about it. We decided this would be an easier route than doing Crazy Eyes, which is half true. Granted it does not require make up, special effects, or substantial amounts of money, but it does take up a lot of time. There are scenes that require a huge cast, and our locations and time are limited. Because everyone involved are friends of ours we are catering to other people's schedules, which would be different if this were a real film with actual $$$$.

With a runtime of approximately 2.5 hours, we are essentially making Titanic this summer. Titanic without a boat. 

Sunday morning, before work, we are shooting some stuff at my house. Hopefully we can knock out most of Mickey Bonez's scenes, as well as a cameo by the one and only Christopher Hatem. I can't wait for this, the Land of Lincoln might be on TRL soon once the teenie boppers catch wind that Lovem is a part of this. I had an idea to dress him up as a shitty metal guy to be Mickey's room mate.

I tell you what, doing the Stavros scene is going to be a trip, baby.
Owww Have Mercy!

Later, all."

6 days of non-stop shooting and we are through.

Are we completely done? Not yet. We are just done for the week. 

We will resume in exactly 2 weeks. Until that time there will be much editing to take care of.
We literally have hours and hours of footage. Good takes, bad takes, bloopers, straight actin' a fool...all kinds of stuff. Many of the nights were spent completely exhausted. We pretty much tortured ourselves much of the week. Most of our shooting days were between 8 and 10 hours of straight work. We were lucky if we took a 5 minute break to eat a PB&J or some chex mix in between set-ups. We've been fortunate enough to have so many positive responses from everyone. To anyone who has helped us out in any way during these last 6 days, you can count on me to help you out with anything you need. To have people waste their days off work, or their leisure time, just to stand around all day in the heat, moving microphone stands, working with lighting, or even shooting is a pretty spectacular thing.

I loved shooting all day and watching the dailies at night. When something turned out shitty, we kicked ourselves and knew we could just do it again tomorrow, but when something turned out amazing...god, the feeling that came over me was indescribable.

I can safely say that a good 70% of the scenes are completed as of now. That is 70% out of a couple of hundred pages of dialogue. I think that is a pretty remarkable thing. We kind of learned as we went along. I can write out a laundry list of problems that were thrown our way during this last week, but somehow, everything worked out.

I am anxious to finish. Now that I know we are close to done, I don't want to stop. At the same time, I want to sit and relax for a minute. Maybe just to ground myself and realize that we are just a bunch of kids having fun, sleeping on floors, trying to make a sitcom and that I need to return to the real world in 2 days. 

If nothing comes of all our hard work, the memories will be worth it. I feel closer to these guys now than I ever have before. We have stories to tell and enough inside jokes to last for years.

Thanks, guys.

Thanks, friends.

"event","This is pretty much my first day back from Shorewood. We all returned yesterday and crashed. We were all exhausted from shooting, shitty diets, bad sleeping arrangements, and lack of sleep overall. Today we had a light day...we only shot for about 5 hours. In that period, we got a ton of stuff done. The last 4 days have turned out excellent. I hope the remaining 4 are equally awesome. We should be cutting some type of teaser trailer in about a week, but sadly the first episode is lacking a scene that we might not be able to shoot until next week at the earliest due to scheduling. 

I am pleased with everything.

It's all been worth it.

Thanks to my partners in crime and the Tasch family for housing us and letting us make a mess. Thanks to Kevin, Guillermo (not!!! :) ), Eddie, Sam, and Liam for all of their help.

I feel like sleeping for hours, but we filmed some scenes this afternoon and we completely ruined my kitchen. There is milk, oranges, and fake vomit everywhere. I need to go mop. It's going to be nice to actually have a quiet evening at home for a change. We have really gone into this thing balls deep and I don't know how those other guys are feeling, but I am tired. It's worth it though. We are having a blast.

Later, friends."

"event","I am at work trying to print out all of these updated Land of Lincoln scripts. I have this one boss that is a nerdy looking faggot and I think he was getting suspicious about what I was printing out. I mean, this printer is sort of loud and printing out 195 pages worth of text is a bit suspect to say the least. I only printed until page 95, then later I will go back and print the last 100. I am slick, daddy! 

Over the last week we added a new character. Two characters actually. One is Mickey Bonez, Brian's friend from High School and full-blown loser. He and Brian never left their town and went on to do anything great with their lives more than a decade after graduating High School. Mickey is the lead-vocalist of a metal band named SEXUAL INTERFORCE. They are making their comeback after their drummer was just released after 6 yrs of prison.

The second character is Stavros, Brian's next door neighbor. He is of European descent. He appears to be unemployed and resorts to yardsales and sexy car washes as fundraisers.

The week of July 8th - 16th, we are shooting a ton. A ton. The first couple of days will take place in Shorehood at Brian's house with his family. The rest of the week will take place at my apartment which Gual and Brian's characters are using as their apartment. Anyone that we talked to about being an actor might not be needed this week. We are trying to knock out all of our scenes first, but who knows. If anyone is available, you are more than welcome to drop in and say what's up or if you are handy with a camera or a boom mic...you can help out!

Monday the dudes got into chat together and we finished up Crazy Eyes for good. We added some Troma-esque crazyness and mailed it out to Lloyd Kaufman. I got an email from him this morning, but he hasn't received it yet. I am sure it will arrive either tomorrow or saturday. Man, I really hope he likes it. I don't know what it means if he likes it, other than it would just be cool. Really cool. 

Anyway, I went through a couple episodes last night and wrote down all the scenes for the episodes and what we can film first. For example, in Ep 6 there are 42 total scenes and 28 of those scenes we can easily shoot during the week of the 8th-16th. I am basically keeping track of all the scenes that either involve just the 4 of us, or are interviews that don't require fancy locations."

I did this once before (I think), but I am doing it again anyway. Here is my buddy Sam's sitcom, Joe Blows Kids.

Here goes the 20/20 special report on Joe Blows Kids. Gual is amazing in this. 

Ok, now lets fill you all in on Robert Alan Lange's life!

My boss got fired today. That is good news. He was an idiot, but he did make me laugh. He just made bad decisions as of late.

Robot Mosh in a week. I can't wait to see Arsis, Decapitated, Necrophagist, An End To Flesh, Beneath the Massacre, Black Dahlia Murder, The Tony Danza Tap Dance Extravaganza, A Life Once Lost, and Veil of Maya. 

I wish Mickey was going :(

I am going to the tattoo parlour Friday night to finally get some shit done. I've put it off for so long. Mostly because I think it makes your body look sinner...

Sike.

Land of Lincoln is completely done being written including two great new characters that are minor roles. They are both equally amazing and I wish I could play them.

Casting seems to be going well. I am sure we're still going to have to do most of the work. Oh well, it's all good.

A good chunk of the shooting will be going down July 8th - July 16th both in Shorewood and at my apartment in Ravenswood. It should work out pretty cool. William's birthday is the 7th so we are all going to party it up for the big guy and I am going to fu- er give him a big gift!

That night will rule. Chances are we will be in Shorewood that night since we want to knock out the Shorewood stuff first. Filming the Tasch family dinner scenes are going to be the most fun ever.

Sending Crazy Eyes out to Troma in a few days after some back and forth talking with Mr. Lloyd Kaufman. We'll wait and see how that goes. 

Along with shooting LOL (hey, that's new...i will not call it land of lincoln anymore LMAO!) we've got some cool ideas for extending An Evening With The Living Dead as a full length. Right now it's not long enough. I love the story the way it is now, and I think the changes will be good.

In fall '07 expect Furious Wiener 5 minute shorts to make their debut on the internets. I have one episode done. It's been done for a while now. We are just trying to do so much already that we don't want to spread ourselves too thin.

Right now I am going to go sit in the living room and make the final changes to Crazy Eyes."

This is currently my favorite picture on Earth. I want to marry you.

The last few days have been alright. I drank some beers and saw some friends...not so bad.

My nephew graduated 8th grade yesterday. 8th grade. I can't believe how they have grown up. It's cool, though. I dig. He's not that shitty of a kid. He likes metal and skateboards, so that's fine by me.

After I leave work in a couple of hours I won't be doing shit for the rest of the day or all day tomorrow. If anyone wants to see me, you know where I will be.

If I don't go out I might just hang out around the house writing music or something. 

I think I might go see Eagle Vs Shark Friday.

Ring of Honor in 11 days!

I had the most fun at work this morning messing with this guy named Josh on my team. Turns out this dude grew up in Brazil because his parents were living there before returnign to America. I felt like messing with him and creating a running theme that I can add on to throughout the day as a fun way to pass time. I began filling him in on everything he missed in America in the early 90's while he was in that dump Brazil.

First of I had to fill him in on the entire LA riot Fiasco. I told him about what happened to the black guy by the white cops, then how those sweet ass black dudes bricked that hillbilly in the face and danced. Then everyone stole tvs and set big fires.

Also! I had to fill him in on the OJ Simpson trial, as well as the infamous white bronco chase that took place while the 1994 NBA FINALS were taking place.

Other awesome things he missed:

The Bulls 3-Peat
Jordan sneaker craze
Mario Go-Kart
Sega Channel
Hulkamania runnin' wild
Contra
Bubble Bobble
Megaman
Charles Barkley Shut Up and Jam

I've said it before and I will say it again...
I would kill to have a job at character development of some shitty Pro Wrestling league. God, I would do such a great job! Lobsterman has always been one of my favorites. Look at this fat fuck!

I think I would be a manager if I could. I have the gift of gab on my side. I can't be Bobby The Brain Lange, so maybe I can be ""Sweet 'N' Sour"" Robbie Lange. Man, I would probably walk around with some type of wand, maybe I would call it my powerbar, and I would use it to make my man win. 

I guess I can always be Ichabod Slain. I would totally do the sleep hallow thing.

Anyway, enough stupid wrestling talk!

I leave for New York in a day. There are a lot of my friends I wish I could have seen before this, but I will be back shortly. I miss my bros more than anything. We will party hard in a week. 

All 6 episodes of the Land of Lincoln are complete and I am really excited to start. I will be shooting some footage while I am in NYC for the show. The guys will be taking care of some other shit while I am gone. This summer is going to be fun. Brian not moving out was a monkey wrench thrown into our plans, but I think we can overcome. Listen fellas, next saturday day/night, after I return, let's get down to business. Maybe we can review my footage or just build a fort in my backyard? Let me know, William, Gual, and Brian.

We need some roles to be filled, preferably by friends who are willing to do anything for art! 
The roles are not that lengthy, they are as follows:

any missing characters (ie Rob, Will, Brian, Gual, Nick, Kitty, Robin, Gabe) are not listed because they have been filled, duh!

	rich - He comes to audition for the male lead in the film
	frank - He comes to audition for the male lead in the film
	jason - He comes to audition for the male lead in the film
	zach - He comes to audition for the male lead in the film
	casey - The final choice for the role of ""Lincoln"" in the film. Casey is gay...literally
	michelle - minor female role
	april - The original female lead in the film. Requires one small Bra shot.
        liam - minor male role
        amanda - The replacement female lead. A party girl like no other.
	sound guy - Minor role. He is fired by Brian and later replaced by Gabe.
	extra diane - Minor female role
	extra frisbee 1 - Dude playing frisbee with his buddies.
	extra frisbee 2 - Dude playing frisbee with his buddies.
	extra frisbee 3 - Dude playing frisbee with his buddies.
	lighting guy - Small male part. 
	crew member 1 - Small speaking role, may require only one day of shooting.
	crew member 2 - Small speaking role, may require only one day of shooting.
	extra 1 - Very minor role
	extra 2 - Very minor role
        Dr. Greenberg - We need a fat friend, or a friend that will be willing to pad his clothes to look fat for this role. The role is minor, but is quite funny. Whomever is casted for this role will probably get to wear eyeglasses and a big fake beard! Also, I will shag you.
	lloyd kaufman - Hopefully he will be played by himself. If not, we may need a friend to step in and act like the craziest old jewish man you can ever imagine! Don't worry about over acting, he is really like what is written.

There you have it, kids! Pass the word to friends or whatever. We would really prefer working with people we know personally simply because this isn't a major production. Well, we are not planning on pressing dvds or anything. They will be online and hopefully nerds laugh. 

Email me @ xthemusicdiedx@yahoo.com or comment on this post. If you want to play a role, even if it is a small part, you will be guaranteed to have the most fun of your life! If anyone wants help out in any other way, whether that is holding a boom mic, holding a light, or just helping us with locations would be amazing. Most locations are easy, but we might need a decent looking ""office"" for Dr Greenberg and Kaufman, possibly. Not anything fancy, a home office would suffice. If anyone has a parent that wouldn't mind letting 4 kids shoot in a room for a few hours, let me know. 

Anyway, I will see you kids when I return. If I am MIA this summer, I will be working on LAND OF LINCOLN. If anyone wants some of Robert Alan Lange in their lives, they should help out. Otherwise you probably won't see me ever.

Love, peace, and chicken grease.

"event","I am here at work right now updating this piece because I have 2 amazing things to share.

Well, not really amazing. One is amazing, and the other is just stupid.

Firstly, yesterday I had to calm down a shitty customer on the phone. She was 42 years old and she told me that her boyfriend was giving her a rub down when he found some cellulite. She told me to go and get a box of waffles for her and read the ingredients...I did.  The ingredients are simple as hell. No wheat, no dairy, no eggs. Probably the healthiest waffle you can eat, I guess. The last ingredient in the waffles is guar gum. She stopped me and said, ""why do y'all put that shit in there, it's bad for you. It's giving me cellulite!"" For anyone who doesn't know, guar gum is a thickener/binding agent. It's a plant-based food that is used in bubble gum or anything else as an egg replacement. I told the bitch, I says, ""look bitch, these are healthy, man. If you have cellulite, it's definitely not from guar gum. Maybe it's from the other stuff you put on your waffles? Ya know, butter and syrup?""

She goes, ""oh yeah, maybe. I doubt it, though.""

""Well, I'm sorry. I am not a doctor, so I can't really say for sure. If you want a refund you can bring it back, but I'm telling you with 100% certainty that guar gum does not cause cellulite.""

""I don't know. For about a month I binged on Haagen Daaz Butter Pecan Ice Cream...""

""I hate to be the one to break this to you, but there is your culprit. Maybe you shouldn't eat so much ice cream.""


The end. She started off pissed them I made her love me.

The second thign that happened to me, happened about a half hour ago and it was amazing!

I was walking to work sipping a coffee, kind of stari ng at the ground while I walk, like I always do when I see a vagina on the ground!

It was a picture from a magazine of a big, gaping vagina. I said, ""Hmm, what is this pussy on the ground???""

I looked up and noticed that every car on my side of the street had a graphic sex act torn from an adult magazine and stuck to every windshield.

I thought maybe 5 or 6 cars would have it. I was wrong. It stretched from Armitage & Sheffield all the way down Sheffield to Clybourn. That's a little over 2 blocks.

That totally made my day. Sometimes life is pretty great."

How will I be remembered?

I was taking a break at work and I went to yahoo to check my email and I saw a headline about a boxer dying. I read the article and one of his friends had the best quote ever for him! I am not poking fun at this dude's death by any means, but man, if you are going to die it would be worth it to have your friends hype you up this much!

I am jealous.

I wonder what my dudes and dudettes would say about me when I die?

Here is the quote with my name in place of ol' boys...

""Robert Lange lived an 'X Games lifestyle,' "" his promoter, Gary Shaw said. ""He was a true warrior. He did everything hard and fast. He loved anything to the extreme. He was the kind of guy in the ring you never had to worry about quitting. I don't know how many times he would say, 'They'll have to kill me first.' "" 


Someone remember to say something sweet about me, ok? I will do the same for you."

I spent most of last night working on homework and studying for my finals. I ended up taking a break to watch Class of Nuke 'Em High and took some notes on it. I love that film so much. I want to make a Troma film so bad. It makes me think of a couple summers ago when Will and I wanted to go volunteer on Poultrygeist. We would have either got fed up and quit, worked hard and got IMDB pages, eat cheese sandwiches all day, and definitely get STDs. That's a definite. An absolute truth.

My wisdom tooth is killing me. They all came in fine except for one...it is still cuttign through. Man, does this shit hurt. No wonder babies cry all day. Faggots.

Tonight is BYAM's show. Should be fun. Afterwards I have to go and get some last minute studying done. Finals tomorrow....blah whatever.

Last night's show was awesome. The entire card was sweet and the whole thing ran over 4 hours.

Colt is still my favorite dude ever by far. His final match was a total comedy fest. The fans threw streamers into the ring (like in Japan), so Colt grabs them all and runs around Adam Pierce in circles, leaving him entangled in paper streamers. 

Then, in the biggest highlight ever, Adam Pierce is there flexing his muscles and talking about how big he is. The smaller Cabana looks worried, but goes to lock up with the big man anyway. Pierce stops him and holds his hand up over his head, while pointing into his open palm and saying, ""No. This is where the power lies!""

Cabana whips his head suddenly to the crowd and exclaims, ""A TEST OF STRENGTH!""

I almost shit my pants at that. All in all my day was pretty sweet. I mean, I left work and drank a million beers at Irazu with Josh, then more at his house while we watched the Bret Hart DVD. 

Last night I got worried that I wouldn't be able to attend Robot Mosh Fest again this year with my bros for some fun! This is because ROH announced their next show on June 23rd with Marufuji, Morishima, and in a rematch of last years match of the year runnier up: Bryan Danielson vs KENTA!

If I had to choose between robot mosh and KENTA/Danielson. Metal would lose no contest. I was already thinking about how I would have to break my friends hearts.

This morning I checked the mosh dates again and saw that it's the 29th and 30th of June...NOT the 22nd and 23rd. I was off by a week. I am happy now. All is well. I can attend both. 

The other night I couldn't go to Milwaukee due to van troubles. It really sucked. I wanted to be there bad.

At least I will see Chris this weekend for a quick and painful slam jam.

I didn't get much sleep last night. I really want to go to bed, but I promised Justin we will BBQ and have Whiskey. We also have a sweet documentary about the rise and fall of the slasher film.

No, this is not a Gang Green appreciation entry, although it should be.  I love this band and I forgot how much until recently.  First off, look at that photo. It's pretty much the best band shot ever. I mean, dudes are like 13 yrs old, spelling their names out with cocaine. Amazing. 

I mostly started thinking about them because recently the Robot Mosh Fest 07 partial lineup was released and it made me think about how much fun Me, Mickey, Chirs, Will, Brian, and Gabe had last year. Especially when we all got those sweet neon hats from the dollar store and wrote skater slang on the brim, which we wore in traditional skater fashion.  I just wish I had my Preschool album with me, so we could have blasted the track, ""SKATE TO HELL!"" because that is an absolutely amazing song.

It sucks outside today.

I just had an energy drink, so I am really worked up.

I have a test in 20 minutes that I haven't studied for. 

The other night I went to a huge beer expo reppin' the whole foods and sampled like 500 beers. We got really drunk and it was the most fun I have ever had getting drunk and paid at the same time.

This Friday I am going up to Milwaukee to see Between You and Me for Chris' release show. I don't know if anyone else is planning to go or not, but I will be up there.  His band is also playing chicago in a week or so. 

Saturday is totally Ring Of Honor and Chicago Ridge will be laid to waste. It will be great seeing Colt one last time. 

Troma is looking for screenplay submissions for Lloyd Kaufman's next film. I wish I had other ideas for horror/comedy that didn't just involve zombies. Wait, a second, why would I ever wish for that!? We should just send crazy eyes. It has a hobo eating a dick, a kung fu dude and a ninja kicking each others torsos off, and a fisherman who baits his hook with his own semen. hmmm...hello, Cannes!

I can't wait until Kaufman screens Poultrygeist here in Chicago. It seems that his only booked screenings coming up are in Europe because he will be there for Cannes anyway. 

I was in the store this morning to get an energy drink instead of a coffee and I saw a new coke product that I had to write about because it is just dumb as shit.  It's called Coke Plus and it's essentially diet coke with added vitamins and minerals.  You know because I want all of my vitamins to come from my pop. Also, I want to ensure that the vitamins are of poor quality that will not be absorbed by the body.  Also, I want to make sure I get all my vitamin D and calcium because I am drinking a hunk of shit product with artificial sweeteners that are linked to brain tumors. You know, it's win-win.

I am going to become a billionaire by approaching every junk company ever and telling them they can make Funions better by adding vitamins.  Maybe dust condoms with vitamins, so when your random skeez yummies down on your gobbadee gook, she can get iron."

Today didn't really work out as planned. I thought I'd get episode 6 done of the Land of Lincoln, but it sort of fell through. Gual and Brian ran late looking at apartments and it just didn't make sense to try to get together. It's ok though, I have a ton of homework to try to finish up anyway.

One said homework assignment is a BIG paper where yours truly compares the emergence of Ronald Reagan as president of the USA and the rise of American Hardcore Punk music as a means of grassroots rebellion. Pretty gnar, huh? Yeah, I know what you're thinking, ""Mr. Lange, you can't write your way out of a nutsack!"" I disagree completely! I am an excellent schoolastic writer! Actually, I take that back. I am an ""OK"" writer and an excellent ""bullshitter."" Top notch bullshitter. Sometimes I think I should be a used car salesman. Honestly, when it comes to school I can get by lookin' like top tits while everyone else is a mop bitch.

Since I've been brushing up on my hardcore history again and mostly reading everything I can about Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys it made me miss being really young. 

When I first bought a guitar at age 14. A hunk of complete shit it was...and an even worse amp. I wanted to be great, but I was realistic about it. I knew that I never would be. I decided to imitate everyone else who was already in a band that I liked who couldn't play for shit either. That's when I started learning punk and hardcore albums in their entirety from start to finish. The first was the the s/t Ramones album, which was a piece of cake. After that it was boogadaboogadaboogada! from the Screeching Weasel. After that I thought I was the best guitarist ever. At this point (with images of naked womens chanting my name) I borrowed a bass and wasn't happy with learning only the guitar parts to albums, I wanted to learn the bass as well. After meeting a dude in high school that would give me drum lessons after practices I learned the guitar, bass, and yes the drums to three of my all time favorite albums...

Descendents - Milo Goes To College
Descendents - I don't Wanna Grow Up
Black Flag - Damaged

To this day, if I have all three instruments and a four track I am sure I can still lay down the entire album if I wanted. Those albums are etched into my memory and are just so important to me.

It's pretty crazy how things have changed. I don't even like music anymore. Well, I do and I don't. Writing music structurally is amazing. I have never been a ""jam"" guy. It's everything else that surrounds music that I hate. I am a much better player now than I was then, but in those days I thought I was hot shit. Even at age 16 I wasn't playing covers to look cool or talented, I just wanted to learn the instrument and become good enough to write on my own. Then I learned theory on my own, so I could do things beyond power chords.

Sorry to bore my 3 readers with the recollection of my teenage years. It was just a really cool feeling that I had inside and I needed to document it."

"event","Got a sweet new icon. What a great game. I miss the golden age of videogames. I am not too big on the current state of gaming. Maybe I will be one day...just not yet. What I do love is how the kids from the nintendo generation have grown up and you now see these little retro-nerd video game hints thrown into pop culture. For example, I was watching ROH and I saw Jimmy Jacobs bust out a move he calls ""the contra code."" I was happy as hell. Oh yeah, dude also has a move that's a jab at myspace called the ""Top 8."" Genious.

Gabe started working at WFM with me. Pretty sweet. I might have to request to do some closings or something so we can drink 40s in the parking lot or smoke dope from an apple maybe. Or we can polish each others Jordan's after we pummel a lesser being into pulp-matter.

I am seeing Mono friday night and it's going to be great. Their last show was so good, but it makes me think of Mickey! He was there with me! I let him borrow my AN hoodie. I bet he could still smell me in his clothes and hair. I bet it gave him a stiff one. I hope.

Abba-Zaba is indeed the best candy in the world and it is my only friend.

I cut most of my classes today. I decided to sleep in. Fuck it, I'd probably just get shot there anyway.

I was watching the news last night and the shooting reports got me thinking...

In one particular news report they visited the myspace and facebook accounts of the recently deceased students. Then the news man would read off the interest column of the page and say something along the lines of, ""Amber will never play volleyball on the beach ever again.""

I am glad that I wasn't shot by anyone...yet. Man, if they read my shit out...could you imagine!?

""Robert Lange will no longer pretend to get fucked by a man ever again."" 

""Port-A-Potties around Shorewood, IL will remain in tact now that this young man's life has tragically been cut short.""

Pretty soon the country is going to get worked up into a gun and security frenzy all over again. I already have beaten up at least 3 Koreans. It might have been more.

Ain't no big thang in 'merica. Yo, all we do is shoot the shit out of everything anway. We breed this kind of idiotic shit.

I'm just waiting for the copycat killings to start. It's inevitable.

I gotta let you friends in on a secret. I haven't showered in a couple of days! I am the grossest guy ever right now. I wanted to do it last night, but I ended up playing guitar for a few hours. Then I mic'd my acoustic and used my reverb and bigg muff pedals going into my bass amp and did a cover of ""sometimes"" by My Bloody Valentine in my own room. I was doing something else entirely when I realized that this was how he created most of the noise on the track, so I figured out the 7 chords that make up the song and played it.

Thus, no time to shower.

I should go and do that. If I don't, maybe I can get sent home early from work tomorrow for cleanliness.

Until next time, kids..."

For those who have seen Grindhouse, this is basically the Italian film that Rob Zombie stole his werewolf women of the SS idea from. This movie is actually terrible and sweet at the same time. It's basically about a foxy nazi scientist that likes to perform experiments on nude girls. Oftentimes, she feeds them to a sex-crazed beast-beast man who lives in a cage. He rapes them and devours their flesh. 

I really hate Rob Zombie. I always have. Not only did he flood us with some of the worst music imaginable...but now he is making horror films. He is going to ruin Halloween. 

If Eli Roth was making the Halloween remake I would get a wet dick over it.

I am kinda bored. Just sitting around at home watching Curb Your Enthusiasm and listening to music. I miss my friends. I really can't wait for summer to come.

I finally watched Die You Zombie Bastards last night and it is the craziest film I have ever seen.  My favorite scene by far is the scene where the 3 sexy twin female scientists are on Hell's Island trying to find a rare animal. Two of the girls are in their tent looking over documents when they realize their ""sister"" is gone. They go to the shore in search of her. They find her swimming nude in the water. They scream, ""hey get back here. We have important research to do!"" Ol' girl says, ""It's too hot for research! Woooo!"" The other girls agree and remove all of their clothes to go splash and play in the water. 

Another memorable scene is when the evil bad guy, Baron Nefarious, seeks pleasure from his zombie girl slaves. He pulls out his MASSIVE, mutated cock and lays it on the table. He them orders the zombie girls to pound it with hammers.

I watched an interview with the director. It took him 4 years to film everything. Mainly because he wanted to shoot 16mm. I can't even imagine working that long on ONE THING. Wow."

"event","I really should dedicate more time to writing music. I really haven't had any time to even pick up a guitar in the last 5 months. It's not just school and work (though those are major factors) I seem to be completely out of ideas. Well, ideas that I like anyway. After spending last summer kicking it and having a blast, I wrote the 11 songs that became the ""you shine like july"" cd. I am still really proud of those songs. The whole writing process came so naturally. I wrote two songs, created a musical theme, next thing I knew, 2 songs became 11. 

I have been working on a few tracks that are sitting here on the hard drive waiting to be finished. We'll see what happens with that.

I should have posted this earlier. It's Sam's short little zombie film. He made it in a couple of nights and my music is all over that shit. This is for my friends who haven't seen it yet/don't know Sam. If you don't know Sam, you are missing out. ENJOY!

In other news, Colt Cabana's last ROH show is going to be the 28th here in Chicago Ridge. He just signed a developmental deal with WWE. I am pretty pumped for this shit.

Saturday Episode 5 of the land of lincoln is being written. Man, I swear this one is going to top all others in terms of laughs. It's also full of penis. Lots of penis. I'm not kidding.

This weekend is also Sam's birthday party. I am sure he is having some people by so I am going to try to swing on in if I can. Should be fun. See some bros and people I haven't seen for a minute.

Monday night I went to a house show. I haven't been to one in a long time. They are always a good time. My friend Dan decided that he wanted to barbecue and drink beers while a bunch of bands played in his house. I showed up and there were already a ton of people there, hanging around outside, drinkin' all them beers...you know, the usual. Dan's band, the Methadones played last and they were all a big mess. Dan's house sounded better than most clubs I have been to recently. Afterward, we all hung out in the kitchen and shot the shit while people drank outside. All in all, a really awesome night. My friend Mike who plays drums for the Methz convinced this drunk ass old guy Nick that I was in Bad Religion. This dude was totally stoked on me being in Bad Religion. This dude is definitely going to be used in episode 5 for laugh material.

Since Monday I've had a bunch of Screeching Weasel and Methadones songs in my head. On that note, I will leave you all with a little bit of rock and roll.

Next Sunday I have to work really late, so that means on saturday I can go out and raise hell. If you know me, I don't like to go to bars on saturday because that's when every chad and heather go out and are annoying as all hell. I think the bros will begin work on episode 5 of the land of lincoln. I can't wait until we finish. Filming shouldn't be too bad at all. Well, maybe like 30% of it will be. That's not so bad, though...

This spring/summer should be fun. I have like 2 months worth of vacation time I can use if I really wanted to. Hopefully I can go take a vacation. We can film all summer, drink all them beers, and raise all kinds of hell.

I can't wait until Brian and Gual move in together. 

If anyone wants to see Chris' band at the end of this month in Milwaukee hit me up.

I don't have a car, but I will probably take the train up there. If anyone is down, let's all go together. If you have a ride hookup, that would be cool, but it's not necessary. It's between you and me (is another dude) record release show and veil of maya and an end to flesh are playing as well. Pop rock and metal for the masses...fine holiday fun.

"event","Before I get into the real deal important shit I want to share something pretty funny. Eddie Griffin wrecked the fuck out of a million dollar ferrari earlier today. You can check out a video of it here. http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070327/od_uk_nm/oukoe_uk_comedian_ferrari 

He was driving it around as part of a promotional event for the release of some terrible film. Griffin sucks. He has never made me laugh once.

Wrestlezone reported earlier today that UFC has bought PRIDE for just under 20 mill. Pretty crazy. At least they are keeping the company around. All of the fighters contracts and dvd libraries are now property of UFC. PRIDE will now be renamed PRIDE WORLDWIDE. This shit is gonna rock MMA big time. I knew UFC was going to blow the fuck up. I called it a long, long, time ago. Once they began hyping up fights and building storylines up and encouraging fighters to talk shit on each other it got the public pumped. That is not the traditional way of doing things. Martial Arts is based on respect. UFC is borrowing a lot from how the WWE hypes a big event. Granted Pro Wrestling is a work and is not based in actual competition. It is still highly effective in building up public interest for their huge shows. UFC made a wise choice of choosing to feature their product in a unique way.

Anyway, if you want to read the story, it's here http://www.wrestlezone.com/article.php?articleid=177026862

Lastly, Chuck Liddell was subjective to 3 random drug tests recently because he was incoherent and actually fell asleep on a texas television show recently while reviewing the film ""300."" Absolutely hilarious. As it turns out, Liddell claimed that he wasn't drunk. He was out late that night and had the flu. He took a sleep aid, as well as a large dose of nyquil. He then only got 3 hours of sleep before having to appear on the morning show. The segment is hilarious. I found it on youtube. Peep it.

I got this link from Mickey, because he is my pop punk news source. He pretty much knows everything about pop punk, pleasing men, and being a totally righteous dude.

Basically the lead singer of that shit band Mest is in jail for murder. Two faggots got into a fight, one faggot died. The other is in jail...getting fucked by tough guys in his faggot asshole. delicious.

Brian, Will, Gual, and I wrote episode 4 of the Land of Lincoln the other day. I went back and read it the next day and I really enjoyed it. I just hope some of the shit that we put in there because it is funny to us proves to be funny to others in the long run. Especially any scene involving Gual whether it is him saying, ""you're kidding!"" or rubbing an ice cube on Brian Tasch's sweaty body.

I did laundry last night, so now I have clean clothes.

This morning I was walking to class when a very tough Nu-Metal girl came storming past me and giving me an evil look. She was wearing headphones and mouthing the words intensely, in a soundless shout. I laughed out loud, I hate kids. 

If I had a giant crane I would probably pick up stupid people and put them in the ocean. Man, a giant crane would be sweet. I would probably mostly just use it to pick up my friends houses when they are asleep and move them to remote/strange locations. I would move Gabe to Spain and watch him wake up in his robe to retrieve a mornign paper from his doorstep only to find spaniards everywhere. Maybe I would put an art school next to him. He would switch into battle mode and a whole country would be vanquished. Art would cease to exist.

Mostly I would just take all of my friends...all of them...every last one and move their houses to my block. Damn, that would be great. A boy can dream, can't he?

yo, buy this shit May 9th...support Boy Armageddon as the gayest dudes to ever live. On tour this summer on the fags of the underground tour with Cold Peter, crucial faggot, and Faggots! at the house party.

Thursday night I went out with a bunch of friends to get drunk. I was feeling festive, so at the delight of absolutely no one, I decided to run as fast as I could and dive into the bushes in front of my house...4 times. I bet I am going to get Monica fined for my actions.

When I woke up yesterday I had cuts all over my arms and legs including a 4 inch cut on my shoulder. Then I felt bad for fucking up the bushes. Later that day, I checked the bushes out and you could hardly tell that I had laid them to waste the night prior. Those mothers are strong!

I got my CW3000HD receiver yesterday. That thing is built liek a tank. I have a computer sitting in my living room that can do everything except serve me drinks and blow me (that's exactly why I need a legion of monkey-butlers). I am going to go home and try to figure it out today.

This morning at work a girl came up to me freaking out because she found mouse droppings in some display crates. She wanted to know if it was fresh or not. I told her that she was in luck because I know everything about rodent feces. For some reason she believed me...

So now that I know she is an idiot, I felt like I needed to roll with it. I pretended to pick some up with my fingers and squish them and roll them together and sniff at my fingers until I said to her, ""yes, this is new. I would say by the smell and texture that this stool is only a couple of hours old. The rodent is still around. be cautious. I told her that by the texture I could tell that he was feeding on grains from the bulk department and that he might be living in a bin or a bag of grain. 

She was like, ""oh my God! Where's Rich? I have to tell him!"" 

A bit later Rich walks up and is all, ""hey kid, Rachel told me dat dere was some mouse shit around dere by produce?"" 

I said, ""oh yeah. I took care of it.""

Then he goes, ""She said you rolled it in yer fingers dere and that you were some kind of expert about shit!?""

I said, ""No, I tricked her.""

Rich says, ""So you didn't pick it up or you are not an expert?""

""Neither. I was just clownin' around. You know, Yassa bossin'?""

He just looked at me and said ""yassa bossin'?"" Laughed...and walked off."

I'm at work when I should be outside drinking beer on my deck. Instead, I am drinking a stupid Odwalla drink. I used to like the free gifts that vendors give me daily, but now they are kind of played out. Give me something useful already...like some of that 'dro.

When I get home I am going to take a nice nap, maybe play some zombie music on the old synthesizer, and probably watch whatever pro wrestling pay per view is on tonight. Yup, geek.

Why is it that when stores have to pick non-offensive, friendly music that will be played throughout the building it is always 80s music? Why? What makes the 80s so special? Fuck, the 80s. Seriously. There was nothing good about the 80s. All we ever play in this dump is new wave shit. Just once I'd like to have a ""MAIDEN DAY."" All Iron Maiden...all day. I would love to shop in a store that played Maiden. If you think about it Maiden isn't really that offensive. It's pretty grandma-friendly metal in terms of brutality and evility (that's not a word).

this post is going to be pointless...you are warned.

I want the FIGHT Network more than anything else in the world. Even more than the hottest BJ. THE. HOTTEST.

It's not in American yet, except for some internet subscription channels that are still impossible to hack. It is available on Bell ExpressVu Canada, which I can ""acquire"" if I so desire. I would have to reposition my dish amongst other things. 

The other night I wanted to watch FIGHT programming so bad that all I did was read about their content for a couple of hourse. Then, I emailed Dish Network and told them that if they started to carry it I would become a subscriber (yeah, right!).

I wish it was easier to mount a dish on my roof. I mean, my landlord was cool enough to do it for me the first time, but I really don't think he would want a second dish drilled into his brick. I wish they sold really stable tripod mounts that I could just sit up there....without being knocked over by the wind. Having BEV and DN would be killer. Oh well, I guess I have to wait until Dish starts to carry it.

I am acting in a shit film today...should be ok I guess. 

I am still really sick.

This girl I work with got her DNA ancestry traced at www.dnatribes.com. It sounds really cool. They can trace your DNA back 500 years. I would do it for kicks, but man, it's like $200 bones. Fuck that, I'd rather spend it on lines of white powder."

"event","So last saturday we began structuring and writing our warriors-esque project tentatively titled ""SANDDOOM!""

Although, the filming would not take place until some time in 2K8, it is fun to write now and see waht we can come up with.  We still can't figure out a name for our gang, but we've figured out the names for some of the rival gangs.

Here is a short rundown of what we've got going on...

The gang consists of Richie (the leader), Vinnie (the tuff), Pestario (the ladies man), and Rene (I think Rene is supposed to be the brains). Richie used to be in the Bladez (a rollerblading, fruitbootin', drug-dealin', bench grindin' type of bros that think they own the beach). Richie is a terrible skater and is kicked out. He forms his own gang in an effort to take down the Bladez and protect the beach.  However, there are a number of obstacles that stand in his way. The rival gangs that our heroes will encounter are the sharks (a gang of bros with shark fins patroling the waters), the spikes (a volleyball gang that compete in various beach volleyball tournaments), Sizzle Beach, U.S.A (a homosexual gang that control the beach house and the bathroom stall gloryhole). I believe that are a couple more gangs but I can't seem to think of them right now.  

Rene leaves the gang in an attempt to better himself partially to please his older brother, who is a businessman and looks down on the gang life.  However, Rene does not know that his own flesh and blood, his own brother is the mastermind behind the Bladez operation! 

We had a lot of fun kicking around ideas that night.  I am most excited about the splashfest the guys ahve with each other before the sharks show up! 

I want us to get a website up and running.

I am going to stay the night with my folks today. It should be pretty nice. I miss them."

Work sucks today. I was goign to call off because I was tired. Then I realized that I would be just as bored at home. Besides, at work I get to have people tell me how I look 17 now with my haircut. I am going to stand outside of a local high school next to a camero and be on furburger watch. Maybe I will have a tattoo on my arm of MY CAR with my name above it. Man, that would be tooooooo rad.

I am supposed to go to the cid today with BHilk and Justin for margaritas and burritos. Man, oh man. I want it NOW.

When I was showering yesterday I realized something sweet. I was checking out my hair and then I slicked it back and I was happy with the results. I would be a welcomed addition to any mafia or bike gang. However, I am now capable of a far greater look! I was able to copy Morrissey's hair circa 1992. It was pretty sweet. I almost kissed the mirror. I asked him if he needed a lift home. Ok, I don't know what that meant.

alright see ya."

I thought I lost my cat today.  Cookie was wandering around, but Ash was nowhere to be found! For about 2 hours she was gone until I went into my bedroom and heard a slight whimper.  It was then that I noticed the rascal had been sleeping in my dresser drawer. Oh, you! You're a naughty pet! I love you, but you're naughty!!!

Sorry for the last part, I watched Tommy Boy last night.

I felt like a girl last night because Brian called me and we talked for an hour almost and immediately following that conversation Josh called me to complain about professional wrestling. I wish I got to spend time with the dudes saturday night in shorewood.

I miss kristine.

I figured out mostly all of Girlfriend In A Coma on the synthesizer this morning. I am such a big dork. 9 AM on my day off and what am I doing? Eating cereal in my underwear and playing smiths songs on the Juno106. Sounds pretty rad, though.

Still don't know how I will get up to that betwixt yo thighz show saturday.

I want a shirt with a wizard on it. Scratch that. I want to be a wizard. One day I would like for my group of bros to have a scetch comedy show just because we could dress foolish all of the time."

"event","the Altar record is really good. It is the best drone cd i have ever heard.

this weather is killing me. give me 2 more years in chicago...i am for sure breaking out. fuck it.

last night i ended up watching a bit of television. first i saw a commercial that (i suppose) was trying to speak to me. it was a college setting and some dude was trying to get with this lady and she wasn't having it. she jumped up and said, ""hey man, you need a condom! if you think having a piece of latex between our hot bodies is worse than spending a night alone...see you later. thanks for the pizza. bye!""

then the guy was all ""oh hey! wait!""

what a hunk of shit. first off, they shouldn't be airing this kind of junk on tv. they are making kids think that sex is ok for them now and totally a must when they are in school. true, college is a big retarded fuck fest, but kids don't need it shoved down their throats on tv. man, we need to clean up television. where is nancy reagan when you need her???

the fun was only beginning!

the new season of the real world was on. the show is taking place in denver this season and it's full of really crappy people except for the biggest black dude i have ever seen. i like him best. naturally, white girls don't talk to him. but secretly i hope he plows all of 'em...bad.
there were these two girls on the show that are kind of close, i guess. both skanks really want this guy that is all hunky in a gay way. he plays em both. he makes out with one and then slams the other. it was pretty sleazy tv.

then the girl that got slammed was really sad because she was drunk and how she can't hurt her friends feelings, etc.

what does she do? lies to her friend and says they just made out. 

ah, girls...

i wanna talk to chris about the episode because i am sure he has seen it. we have sat on a couch before and watched at least an hour of a real world together.

that show started as an experiment in sociology. let's take 7 people from different backgrounds and put them in a modest environment and see what happens. maybe we will learn something about social interaction? now, it's become ""let's get some really hot people and watch them fuck! maybe we  can film then, too!""

come on nancy reagan...

it wasn't all terrible tv. i did catch simon pegg's BBC sitcom, ""spaced."" i thought it was well-done. 

some guy at work ran up to me and was so excited taht he was stumbling just to tell me that there are pictures of britney spears' vagina on the internet. who cares? 

fuck your played out vagina, skeez."

"event","yesterday was my nephew ricky's birthday, so i spent the evening with my family. he has gotten kick ass grades so i bought him a really nice element board. then, steve and i wrote a really sweet techno song together. words can't describe how happy i am that my newphews are so into music. 

i am realizing now more than ever before just how much they look up to me. it's almost frightening, but in a very cool way. i just don't want to fuck up my life too bad or be a negative influence on them. i like to think i am a great uncle and role model to them.  i am sort of the glue holding my family together right now. Sometimes it gets really tough, but i know i have to be there for them.

other than that, life is pretty good. i mean work is busy, but i am not unhappy. school is almost done and i am getting good marks. 

i watched a guy yell at his girlfriend for like 15 minutes because she was looking at me. i thought i was going to have to fight some chad on the orange line over it. i was all prepared to say, ""yo, your lady ain't fine. i don't care.""

then on the brown line, 6 puerto rican and black girls were going fucking crazy! for real, they were running around punching each other and just being nuts. they even beat up one of their ""plumper"" friends that had on sweat pants and beat her down. while she was down they totally pulled her pants and underwear down. it was sorta gross, but whatever. i was just in awe of these crazy skanks. i have never seen anything like that. it lasted for 20 minutes!

my phone should be here mid-week. they have been giving me shit and i have been too busy to call them.

whatever.

people can still call me.

i am sick of seeign so many faggot geeks outside of bestbuy every day waiting in line for some nerd device. i can't think of anything i love enough to wait in line for. i can't even stand in line at a grocery store without walking away somewhere. i get that from my mom, i guess.  

seriously though nerds, knock it off. i hate seeing your dumb collapsable chairs and overhearing you talk about lame shit. 

also, everyone should stop shopping at my store. we're full...no more room for you and your needs. 

i am also tired of hearing about the kid that got tazer'd by that cop. i saw the video and it was pretty rough.  the thing that i really hate is that when things like this happen people choose to acknowledge certain parts of the story.  fact is, this kid was breaking a rule...a stupid rule taht too many schools enforce, but it is actually for the safety of the students. if you are in a lab or school facility and have no proof taht you are a student, you are in violation. The cops actions were ridiculous, they kept tazing him and yelling ""get up or we'll zap ya!"" 

here's what i think. this kid, probably very overpriviledged like most of us americans whether he realizes it or not felt like he was being singled out and thought it was unfair that he had to follow this rule. he decided to use this paltform to voice his opinions about law enforcement, security guards, or even the republican party. he was not co-operating, he was causing a disturbance. i don't feel bad for him because he asked for what he got. the cops were wrogn in every way. they should have just removed him by force and maybe take him to a dean or scare his rich-ass and put him in jail for a few hours with some tough blacks.  

here's what i am getting at...if you are being hassled by a cop (i have been before) always follow instructions.  Play it cool, keep your mouth shut. answer with a yes sir, no sir, i am sorry, sir.  acknowledge why they are stopping you and don't challenge it. if you are being issued a ticket taht you feel is unjust, don't voice it, you will just end up regretting it.  you can always fight it later. don't be a moron and call a cop a ""pig"" or tell them that they are ""abusing their power"" or even some bullshit about the patriot act.  be cool...be smart...you think this cop gives a fuck? no way. when it's over with you should have their badge number memorized and go take care of business that way.  you'll be safe and you won't get your penis zapped or your teeth broken.

fucking idiots.

"event","This morning while I was walking to work I saw a guy standing on the corner of North and Sheffield stumbing into the street and drinking a Corona.  It was obvious that he was out drinking all night. As I walked by, he looked dead at me and just mumbled, ""wasted"" while trying to keep his balance.

Wrestling was really fun as always.  Beforehand we drank beer and listened to Chris' new song.  Damn, that band is going to be popular.  I am going to be sitting on my couch eating cereal in my underwear and watching fuse when i see his video.  Then I will think to myself, ""this is my best bud!I've seen his dick!""

Because I have...we all have.

I miss my bros. Next weekend at Kristine's should be really fun.  I actually have Sunday off, so I am going to get down as long as nobody cries.

I went out with Eve and Andy the other night, it was really fun.  I am going to miss them.  There was a gay Capt Morgan promo at the bar brought to you cortesy of some stupid insta-tan bitches with dumb hair and fake everything. 

Stupid skanks.

JORDAN, TONY, AND JOHN AREN'T MOVING ANYMORE!

I just found out and I could not be happier. They each fell in love and don't want to leave.  John got a big raise and is in love with money, Tony met a girl that wasn't scared of him and now he is in love, Jordan fell in love with latin inches (aka KAPTAIN KEWL bka ME)

I heard rumors for a while about Bell's beer not being available much longer in Illinois.  I talked to some folks and turns out Larry Bell had a fight with his distributor in Illinois and said, ""fuck it, no beer!""

Now, the town will be dry.  I've been freaking out and buying two hearted everyday.  If any of my bros want to stock up and need the discount, let me know.  I will gladly help a friend in need.

They are thinking it's going to be gone for about a year.

I almost wish I was able to go to a halloween party last night, although seeing Chris was better than sex...sex with Chris was better than being able to fly!

I was on the train Friday night after the bar and I saw a bunch of dumb teenagers and their gay costumes.  I even saw one faggot dressed in a store-bought Napolean Dynomite costume...geek.  I got to thinking about what I would be that wouldn't cost any money...not even thrift store stuff.  I would just get an egg box from work, a large one.  Then I would cut a hole in it for my head and for my arms.  Then, I would get a big sharpie and write ""cock"" on each of the four sides.

COCK BLOCK

yup...I would just go to all the really stupid parties, especially if I had gone to Urbana full of 60% scum and get in between a jock and a lady and ask if they wanted to watch tv or play monopoly."

There was some really great bad brains and black flag footage, too.  When they covered the Boston scene and SSD's ""The Kids Will Have Their Say"" I almost exploded in my chair. I am such a nerd.

I ate some really good curry, too. Kicked it. Watched Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a little bit of that Mighty Boosh.

Me, Will, Gual, and Brian need to get together and have a produckshun meetin'.

Me and Boots Electric Hatem are getting down and dirty tomorrow. If anyone wants in, call me. I am off Monday and Tuesday. Yummy down on that chunky dick snot, posers.

I bought the Moog documentary used the other day at reckless because it was just too damn good NOT to buy it. The DVD has sweet bonus material like additional interviews and deleted scenes...standard shit.

BUT! It also has the demo version of the Minimoog virtualsynth that was put out by Aluria I believe. I can't wait to install that, along with one of my MIDI synths, I will have the closest replica to an actual Minimoog without spending $2400.

William ""Junebug"" Church, did you ever find the full minimoog program? I found a torrent a while back, but muhfuckas aren't sharin'."

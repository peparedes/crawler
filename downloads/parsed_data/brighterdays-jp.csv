"event","Pictures for the party are on the site (www.graspingsand.com).  This weekend was a wonderfully long and hectic weekend.  The party was really great.  Ezel from San Francisco played some really old school acid house.  For the first time I heard the song ""Scacid"" which was ska and acid house mixed together...crazy song!  He also played ""Higher State of Consciousness"" and the crowd went crazy.  Jones went on at 2 and spun till past 5 am.  His 3 hour set was tight and in the end he was drenched in sweat and the crowd wanted more.  I don't know the names of the tunes he played, but he put on some anthems which were amazing!  

After the party I went off to Sendai to do some photo shoots for the All Japan Kudo Martial Arts Tournament and now I am finally going to bed....so the grammer or structuring of this log may be a bit messy.  Well, Not only were we blessed with a crazy BrighterDays, but my Senpai, Alexei Kononenko, who I respect very deeply won the all Japan Full Contact Fighting Category in Sendai.  What was even more amazing was he won the entire competition with all ""Ippon"" (the oppenent is knocked out or gives up).  This is extremely rare!  I can't wait to be at 50 percent of his level!  Anyway, he wants to teach me surfing and fighting and I want to learn both, so I will have to go up to Sendai one of these days for an extended stay.

Tired so I will end this one short. 

Thanks for those who were able to show up for BrighterDays.  For those who weren't able to check out the photos!

Thanks and peace,

"event","Yo!
Correction first:  DJ Ezel will be spinning, not Ezal(accidentally spelled it like the crack-addict from the movie ""Friday"" hehe )

Can't wait for the party to kick off in a few more days.  I will be posting pictures of the party on the site again!

Also, video clips of Martha are up on the site as well...really funny!

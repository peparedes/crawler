"event","I ate my sandwich perched on the beach. It was good, very tasty. Especially after being a cat for so long. That always gets me in a fish mood. I wished I could have had a nice glass of wine with it, but it wasn't my place to go snooping around for this Hugo's liquor. When I was done, I wrapped the blanket tighter around myself, and stood.

I spent the next long while walking up and down the coastline. It's lovely in the morning, and I found some shells that would make for a killer necklace. But then the sun started to get higher, so I started to head back.

Maybe Orlando and the Brat will be willing to go do something fun.

As I near the house, though, I see a figure laying unconscious on the beach. I rush over, and to my dismay discover it's a naked Orlando. ""Orlando? Orlando! Wake up!"" I poke him, then shake his shoulder.

'Hey!' I hear a voice shout, and instinctively know it's Viggo. Fucking piece of shit!! I did <i>not</i> need this right now!"

"event","Dad came alone to pick me up at the airport. He was moping really bad. He could barely say hello. Mom before I left told me that Dad had got a new boyfriend. But she also said that he was really sad about something--which is why he didn't call me. I wonder if they broke up?

Dad won't talk about it. He took me back to an empty house, with pretty much nothing more than a ratty old couch and a small bed. He gave me the room with the bed, and what I can tell from the surroundings this was his studio.

He goes into one of the empty rooms, and locks the door. And no matter how hard I knock, I'm not being let in. So I go out to the kitchen area, and find Dad's cell. I search through the lists of contacts. Bean. I know that name! It's Dad's new best friend. I dial the number, and wait for him to pick up."

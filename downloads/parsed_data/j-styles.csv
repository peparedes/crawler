"event","hmmmm. i thought i had something half way interesting to type about when i clicked the little post button but perhaps i was misled. 

i cannot seem to wake up fully this morning. woke up at 8. had coffee. puttered around on the internet. layed down with the dog on the couch and that made me snooze and now i'm just still half brain dead. 
what i should be doing this morning is finishing up math homework and writing thank you cards and exercising but instead i've slept. ate liccorice. and sat in front of the computer. hmmm. not exactly what i call productive!

i tried to go bowling on saturday night but there were no open lanes so instead i watched chris and his friend jeff play shuffle board.

im in the process of trying to work up the nerve to get into the dentist. 

i've also been having really vivd dreams lately about stuff that is not pleasant. i am trying to just shake them off. but i definitely think that it says something about where i've been mentally. some of my bad dreams have been about chris. and when i reflect on it, for the past few weeks/months (i have a hard time with time lines, things tend to blend together) i keep thinking about/focusing on a really terrible incident that happened with him at the end of last december that almost caused us to break up. how much i've been thinking about it, in fact, leads me to believe that i certainly never fully forgave him. its still there, effecting my opinion of him and my daily interactions with him. 

last night at work around 6 a homeless dude came in and asked me if i would give him the pizza at the end of the night and i had to tell him there was no way that i could do that. its not because i'm heartless. and actually, a few years ago i got to be familiar with Jerry, a dude who hung around the streets near my house and i used to bring him whatever slices i could at the end of the night. the difference here though was this guy coming to the shop and asking in front of other customers and other employees. i couldn't very well sneak it to him that way. anyways, he did look at me like i had no heart though and was like, ""well, you should really tell your manager that you guys should give your pizza to the homeless at the end of the night"" what am i suppose to say to that? i don't know. it was an upsetting situation for me. it caused me to reflect even further on how much crap i have and yada yada. im going to have to find some way to find peace with my conscience. 

that's enough. i swear i'll productive now."

the list goes on. and last night i was feeling like the bad consumerists. so maybe i can find a way to donate some clothes or ""stuff"" to people who ""need"" (?) it more than i do...

i slept until noon again today. it really just makes me feel like such shit to sleep that late. however, when chris leaves for work at 8 30 and i'm home alone with nothing to do until i go to work at 5pm it sure does pass the hours of the day to just sleep through them. wow, that sounds pretty pathetic. truth though!!

i don't really have any major new years plans. for the first time since i've lived here someone actually invited me to a new years party. which is pretty rad but i doubt i'll go. house parties aren't really my thing, especially when under age drinking is going on. certainly not because i disapprove of their drinking but because i don't want to end up being help responsible for any of their stupidity! so, i don't know what i'll do. chris' friend jeff will want to hang out i'm sure. i just hope that nobody wants to try and come over to OUR house because i haven't thoroughly cleaned in ages and i hate my hell hole of a house with everything falling apart and old. yah. 

i'm doing my best to not spend loads of money which is really hard for me. see, lately, my wallet has felt like one of the coin purses in games that as long as there is something in it, the money multiplies. i've been working more than i had in the last three months and a lot of night and a lot of shifts all by myself so my tips just keep adding up and because i'm always working or sitting around at home feeling sorry for myself i'm not spending any of it! i need to remind myself that this won't last. as of monday i go back to school and yah, that means less working. it's especially going to hit home when we make that first car payment. and all of my check from my student loans will be going to pay off my laptop. because i'm in school now there is the slight chance that i'll get a refund on my taxes rather than owing like i did last year but i'm sure that chris will end up owing so that money will probably just go to pay HIS taxes. its so fucked up. we just just barely go above the line of being ""ok""...ya know. we're certainly not poverty level but at the same time, we aren't fucking rich and we end up paying sooooo much in taxes. gah. 

my dog keeps barking at everything and anything and most likely nothing. its really irritating the crapola out of me!"

"event","oh the joys of cooking. 

i had stir fry veggies that needed to be used up and I knew i wouldn't want them for dinner before they went bad so I used my handy dandy vacuum sealer that chris and i got for christmas and cooked up stir fry and sealed it in bags for the freezer so i can just take it out when i want it.

and miiiiiiiiso soup! yum!!!!! i've never made a homemade pot of miso soup before, actually. but i had all the fixins and the instructions are just so darn easy i couldn't resist! i made a huge pot so i know what i'll be eating for the next few days. 

and baking tofu. so much cheaper than buying those pre baked little packages that are like 5 bucks each at the grocery store and i can seriously devour them in under 5 minutes. 

my next mission: learn how to make homemade veggie burgers to keep in the freezer with my handy dandy sealer! i haven't found a recipe that fulfills all of my requirements for the perfect veggie burger yet so i think that i'm going to have to improvise. but maybe with a very small batch in case they are gross. not that anything i make could ever be gross cause i'm a master chef, but you know...
i'm thinking lentils, black beans, carrot, what other veggies? i don't know...onion and garlic obviously cause that goes into like everything i make. i've heard of people using split peas in their veggie burger mix before because its a lot easier to integrate than real veggies. oh! chick peas! yes...cause we need the uber protein.

anyways, this entry is totally borrrrring. i really don't have much to say. work at 2. i'm really ready for school to start back up. i've been staying up all night and sleeping until between 10 and 12 for the last week or so and its really messing up my bodies schedule or whatever. i need to regroup and refocus and get back to work. yup."

i have spent crap tons of money these last few weeks..or week..or something. i don't really know when all this money spending occurred to be honest! i know that last night i spent $60 on buying these god damn thank you cards that grow into flowers if you plant them. why? i don't know. they sounded cool and i was at home, bored out of my mind, shopping on the internet. bad idea, folks!! 

thankfully, my dad still owes me $200 for my school bucks and i've got a grip of actual cash in my wallet from all the tips i made while working the kitchen shifts all day every day. 

jesus, between two stores, this week i spent $320 on groceries alone. granted, i hadn't been grocery shopping in a long time and trader joes had my favorite dried pineapple which is never in stock so i bought like 6 packages of it and at 5 bucks per pack that adds up pretty quick. and fucking natures didn't have my favorite hair stuff in stock so in order to get a product with the same effect i had to buy two different products that both cost the same as buying the one. 

on wednesday i went to the evil evil shop, Vanilla, evil because i can't go in there without spending a grip of cash. seriously, since they opened a few years ago I have spent so much money there that I actually get an employee discount now when i buy stuff. so i saw this really neat candle there, and chris' sister in law had put candles on her xmas wish list so i just picked it up and bought it and didn't think twice about it. well, when i got home i realized it was a fucking 30 dollar candle and i was like, oh hell no!! i put a 20 dollar limit on everyone's gifts this year so now the candle is just sitting on my desk, probably never to be used! ugh!

anyways, that's my rant about money. luckily pretty much all the bills are paid so it's sort of money that lying around but i'd really like to have put all that into the savings account. ho hum."

Dharma Bums-Jack Kerouac (as well as On the Road because no, ive never read it and feel like thats some sort of sin of my generation)
Gentlemen of the Road-Michael Chabon
Out of the Silent Planet & Petraland both by C.S Lewis (the first two books in a trilogy. Chris has read them already and says there are some highly religious ideas in the books which I think is to be expected if you decide to read C.S Lewis. He says the plot more than makes up for our heathen disliking of religious undertones)
The Brothers Karamazov-Fyodor Dostoevsky
Ines of My Soul-Isabel Allende (i think its sort of a memoir style book...i dunno. i like her fiction.)
ummm. The Year's Best Science Fiction (dorky but i love SF short stories)
Rant-Chuck Palahniuk
Living to Tell the Tale-Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Seeing-Jose Saramago (this is the sequel to the book Blindness which i LOVED.)
and then some comics..

speaking of my boss, while i am incredibly grateful that i do HAVE a job, i still hate my job. its kind of screwed. i have got out of my way on multiple times to make sure that the labor rates stay as low as possible. this means that i work alone, completely alone, a lot. sundays, i open up the restaurant and run the front of the house by myself from 1 until 4 30 pm. on tuesdays i cook and run the front by myself from 2 30 until 4 30. fridays its from 2 until 3 30 and on saturdays from 2 until 3. now, most of those days it's only for an hour or so but still, if we get slammed i'm screwed. so yesterday, i got soooo pissed. we have this new prep guy/dishwasher but he seems to be under the impression that he doesn't actually HAVE to do dishes, like he's above that shit or something. so he leaves at 2 and the kitchen manager leaves at 2 and i'm supposed to be there until 3 30 by myself and we got incredibly busy. it wasn't a normal friday because no one was working so we got this late after shopping, lunch with family rush at like 2 30 instead of the normal 11 30-2 business. the fucking prep guy left like 4 tubs of dishes for me to wash and the back prep area a wreck!! i ran out of silverware halfway through this time and it's like, you can't wash silverware unless you go through all the bus tubs to separate it. i didn't have the time to go through 4 tubs of dishes!! i was ragin' cajun..lemme tell you. but there isn't anything i could/can do about it because like at all restaurants, the cooks/back of the house are kings while the front of the house are the lowly peons..which is totally whacked because unlike at most restaurants, we split our tips equally with the back of the house and yet its our personality and customer service skills that earn most of the tips. not like tips are even halfway decent here anyways. we make around 5/shift in tips each...which people are flabbergasted by. why bother being a waitress to make that little in tips. i'm lucky cause i still make my old wage from when i was a ""manager"" which was a shit wage for being manager but pretty decent for just doing the normal employee stuff. 

anyways, i'll try and remember to be grateful that i have a job at all!!!"

ok. i finally finished my fucking speech. this is how i know i turned in the worst rough draft ever. it took me all afternoon and all night yesterday and most of this morning to get it to the point where i could actually feel like it was an A piece of work. I made a killer visual aide though. 

i know. all i ever talk about anymore is fucking school stuff but thats because that is what is taking up the majority of my time right now. i dont have the energy or time for any sort of social life. 
it's only going to get worse next term, too. I've got 17 credits next term along with a pain in the ass work schedule so we'll see if i survive. in case you're interested, i've got my 2nd term of spanish, math 243, soc. 201, writing 122 and a library sciences course that im only taking because i really think it will help me when i get around to wr. 123..or maybe im taking 214. i cant remember. anyways, im totally bummed out because i really wanted to take this gender communications class because while i dont need it for me degree i really think it would be beneficial and sounds super interesting but i just dont have room in my work load and then i was going to audit the class and just go when i had time but its at the same time as a class i need so that wont work either. super bummed. 

i havent been getting along with chris most awesomely it seems like. Maybe its just because im too tired to actually enjoy being a relationship right now but he's really bugging the crap out of me!!! Last night i was sitting on the floor talking to the little cat that just got spayed and he came an kneeled and then farted right in my face and i FREAKED OUT. it was so rude. its not like he came over specifically to fart in my face but he just doesn't care at all when it comes to me. He wouldn't do things like that to other people...Just because you live with someone and feel comfortable around them doesn't mean you shouldn't do little things like step away when you have to pass the worlds smelliest gas!! Boys are SO DISGUSTING. Anyways, things have just felt really strained. 

Umm..that's it. I should be getting ready for work. Boring stuff."

"event","i feel like people are talking about abortion all around me lately!! so, here are some lyrics for you lovely readers because the topic has been making me feel all funked inside:::

i opened a bank account when i was 9 years old 
i closed it when i was 18
i gave them every penny i had saved 
and they gave my blood and my urine a number
and now i'm sitting in this waiting room
playing with the toys.

and i am here to exercise 
my freedom of choice.

i passed their hand held signs
i went through their picket lines
they gathered when they saw me coming
they shouted when they me cross
i said, why don't you go home
just leave me alone
i'm just another woman lost. 

you are like fish in the water
who don't know that they are wet
as far as i can tell
the world isn't perfect yet 

and his bored eyes were obscene
on his denim thighs a magazine
i wish he'd never come here with me
in fact i wish he'd never come near me
i wish his shoulder wasn't touching mine
i am growing older waiting in this line
some of lifes best lessons are learned at the worst time.

and under the fierce florescent
she offered her hand for me to hold
she offered stability and calm and
i was crushing her palm
through the pinch pull wincing
my smile unconvincing
on that sterile battle field that sees
only casualties
never heros
my heart hit absolute zero.

and lucile your voice still sounds in me
mine was a relatively easy tragedy
the profile of our country looks a little less hard nosed
but that picket line persisted 
and that clinics since been closed
they keep punding their fist on reality
hoping it will break
i don't think theres one of them
lives a life free of mistakes.

its ani. duh. lost woman song. and yah."

so whine whine whine whine.

i went to bed at almost 3am last night and woke up at 5am and i'm pretty tired but i have to go and take a spanish test and its cold here i'm not feeling very good about myself at the moment but i guess that's not so unusual i hate fighting with my dad and i hate the holidays and WHINE!!

lol.

i have made the most awesome of friends in my physics class. she like, wants to be friends with me for real or something cause she said she wants to hang out outside of class which is amazing to me because i think i am the most annoying person every but ROCK. and i got a 97% on my test i took on monday which is freaking fantastic.

"event","i had a nervous breakdown at my dad's on saturday night...just this combination of being THERE and exhaustion and the girlfriend and her family. I freaked out and cried at an obscene level and I'm sure made my dad feel like crap about things that I never meant to make him feel like crap about...it was awful. 

I've just been very overwhelmed lately. That's what it all comes down to. I can't keep up with my life. Plenty of people do what I do every day (and more) but for some reason it's just so hard for me. Right now, all I can do is try and keep my head above the water when it comes to school and work and everyone else has just sort of fallen to the wayside. 

The onset of darkness certainly doesn't help. It hasn't even really been cold yet! Just the fact that it's dark when I get up in the morning and dark by the time I'm done with school and/or work... it gets to me really quickly. A couple of winters ago I did tanning to try and keep my mood elevated and it seemed to help some but I really wasn't sure if the benefits outweighed the risks so I never continued... perhaps in really small doses though it could be good and not give me tumors!?

OK. I should really do homework rather than update my LJ. I just painted my toe nails hot pink. I'm kind of bummed out because I found this totally awesome vegan nail polish at this upscale skin/hair/makeup store and they are going out of business and now I don't know where to buy it from easily because they don't sell the brand on sephora!! /sadness.

goodnight."

"event","exhaustion!! i have to give mad props to people who not only work and go to school but have kids as well because i only do two of the three and im on the verge of dying!!

today was donners last day of his school. he has graduated from six weeks of dog training. i think after the holidays we'll do some more training classes with him, maybe more of actual commands. gosh, i feel like we could complete the same course again still learn so much. my good dog works so hard in his classes. i <3 him.

have to go to dinner at my dads which i really want to do but am dreading at the same time because a) as usual, there is nothing i want to eat there...i'm going to bring some of my own food, damnit!! b) i don't want to see denchi c) i have SO much homework to do and it takes an hour to drive out there and an hour to drive back and a couple of hours there and that leaves no homework time!! and d) i'm fucking tired.

so that's all for today. its really been school, work, homework, school, work, home, repeat endlessly for the last few weeks. i really want to go visit my friend in hawaii over new years. I would only need enough money to buy a plane ticket but even that is stretching it right now."

"event","i was SO angry with tha boss last night.

story time! i worked last night (normally a night off for me) to cover for the kitchen manager so he could get a tooth pulled. so it was kind of a long day already cause i worked my normal shift in the afternoon as well. so, we had a cleaning company come in last night to do a deep clean on the place and everyone was like, oh, you won't have to worry about them. just lock up as usual and someone else will come by to shut off the light and let the cleaners out when they're done. at around 8 30 the boss calls me, just after i had left the restaurant and was like, ""oh! i have an emergency. can i get you to close up for the cleaners."" so, me always so eager to please and be helpful was like, ""sure, whatever."" so i wait and wait wait. at 10 30 i drove up there and they looked no where near done so i came back home, took a shower and get ready for bed so i could just go up there and then come home and sleep. finally, it's fucking midnight and i still haven't gotten a call to go close the place up so i drive up there to see wtf is taking so long and all the lights were out and the alarm was set...which means boss had to have gone up there and done it. umm..ok, so i waited around until midnight to do something that you apparently decided you could do!!! omg was i ever angry. 

the worst part of it was, i had to be up at 5am for math class today and now i have to go to work from 10-3/5-9. fucking tired!!!!!

so yah, that's my work rant. it felt like old times where that place completely ate my life and i was always miserable and over stressed and over worked. i'm so glad that's not my life all the time anymore and i don't intent to be so helpful in the near future!!"

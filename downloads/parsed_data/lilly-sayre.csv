"event","Here's my version. You can read Austin's at: www.livejournal.com/ekaastraarya Though his is a bit distorted :p

Well, like he said, he got there late, around 11 pm. I was mad, because he was suppose to be there at like, 9/9:30. Leave it to men to get lost like that. We ended up just talking and hanging out by the pool. Around 12:30, the parents, who were talking by the Nastold cabin, decided it was time to go in, but they let us stay out until 1. We talked really well, like we'd been used to sitting and talking together forever. For 15-20 minutes, we sorta attempted to cuddle, but it was kinda impossible with the pool chairs we were sitting on, and the fact that past injuries were haunting us. At 1, we ended up going our seperate ways, though he did walk me to my cabin, which wasn't that far from the pool :p

Saturday was a long day, full of stuff, so I'll break it up like he did. I was up before him (no surprise there) but he didn't take too long to come out. We just hung out around the cabins, waiting for his dad to return from a run, and decide what we were going to do that day. We intially decided to go to breakfeast, walk down the strip (that was probably my millionth time going down it, urrrrrrrrrrrrg), go by a stream, then to New Found Gap (it's a pull off on the mountain where it has a spectacular over look, and a little climbing thing off to the side) then go to Cherokee, NC. We ended up doing all but the latter, cherokee. 

Breakfeast was fun. Everyone, except me, of course :P, was acting like a kid. Mallory and Amy were playing around, so I shot one small piece of cereal at her, nothing major. But that started Austin off, flicking cereal at Amy and Mallory. Amy retaliated by throwing a piece of bacon that she droped at Austin, who then threw it at Mallory, who then stuck it in his juice. I then took it out, and left it on the napkin. Though, Austin wasn't done. He took the wet bacon, and threw it at Mallory, who flung it at the guy at the table next to us! I was a bit embarrassed, but he found it hilarious, and we were laughing forever about it. 

The strip wasn't that exciting. It was miserably hot, and there wasn't much to do. We had two hours to go up and down a strip I'd seen a million and one times. Though, Austin and I had a good time just talking, holding hands and goofing off. 

Then we went to the stream on out way to New Found Gap. I slipped a few times, just like everyone except the guys. Whatever happened to girls being graceful? :p Anyways, Austin threw a rock at me, and then I was going to too, so i chased after him and almost fell on my face! But then, he was balancing on some rocks, and he told me to throw some rocks at him to see if he'd fall. I'm not the best thrower, but I got some good ones in there. He caught a few, and I came close a lot, but I did manage one good one to the leg. Then he threw on at me, missed on purpose, so when I turned around and bent over to pick it up, he threw one right into my butt! What a braziant (sp?) act!

Then we headed up to New Found Gap, eventhough we were all sweating and hot. He decided it'd be fun to jump off things, but I guess it's a boy thing :P But then we went off to the side, where they have this thing with steps, and on top, you can climb over some rocks, and up a small trail. We did that, and finally had a few minutes together. It was really peaceful. It was all quite, and the surroundings were beautiful. 

After that, we went back to the cabins, because we were hot and didn't want to go around more shops in Cherokee. Austin and I ended up going swimming while Mal and Amy took a nap. We had a lot of fun, though he was rough when he tried dunking me, and stuff. We just had a blast splashing around and goofing off together. 

After we took showers, and hung out a bit, we ended up leaving for Cades Cove. Cades Cove is a motor nature trail, basically. You see animals. Like deer, bear and turkey. (We actually did see a bear both times we went). The first time I went, it wasn't too bad, I had a lot of fun with my uncle and my aunt, but this time it was pretty boring. Austin and I ghetto texted message each other to have a private conversation. We used his cell, and typed out a message, passed the phone, read it, cleared it, and replied, repeating the whole process, lol. We also held hands a lot in the car. At one point, my sister and I had to get out for a family shot, and then when I got back in, I sat in the middle, right next to Austin (we were in the very very back of the van). Btw, it's a long drive to and from Cades Cove. On the way back, we were really getting bored. Thanks to Amy, and Paula Abdual, we started dancing in the car, lol. We were just having a blast. All hyped up, and not giving a crap. Then, as my caffeine high ran out, I ended up sorta leaning/cuddling up to Austin. Then, I just didn't care anymore, and sorta rolled over, and fully cuddled up to him. It was the single most greatest thing that's ever happened to me, it seemed. He was so loving, gentle, caring, everything. And he acted like no one was around, and that made it feel really awesome. Oh, and he used his caring voice, the one he uses when he's really sweet on the phone, or when I'm upset. I loved it. We did this until we stopped to get some food. We hadn't eaten since breakfeast that morning, and I'm sure everyone was hungery. I know I was. I ate my entire plate of spaghetti in like, 3 minutes flat, lol. That was fun, too. Austin was really really really hyped up. And Amy can't communicate, lol. The waitress asked her if she wanted a large or small box, and amy was like, ""yeah"". lol. it was great. After that, we just went back to the cabins and went to bed. It was pretty late, close to midnight. 

Sunday, the last day, was alright. We ended up going to a pancake house, that didn't have the best pancakes, hashbrowns or oatmeal, lol. My waffel was pretty good, but HUGE. And I wasn't that hungery. After that, my sister wanted to shop, so we ended up doing some stip malls, then an outlet mall. We had some time alone, and that was nice. Though, it was kinda sad, since we knew out time was running out like sand through your fingers. I was actually able to open up, and talk about my feelings in person. I've never been able to do that before. It's amazing, how this relationship has progressed in the last 11 months. But after we left the mini outlet mall, we went to an A&W, and that was the last thing we got to do. We were all hot and a little melancoly, at least Austin and I. We made out goodbyes there, and went our seperate ways. At least for the next month and half, two months. 

Out of all the trips, this one had to be the best, even if the shortest. I had such an awesome time, and I'm sure he did as well.

And if any of you were wondering, Mallory is my sister, and Amy is her friend."

By third period, i was insanely short of breath, my heart was racing, my speech was rapid and slurred and I was freaking out. I ended up going home early, and the doctor said it was probably a reaction to the caffeine in midol, but I've never had a problem with caffiene before. Another thought was the diuritic in the midol stripped the potassium from my body, and that put me into shock. I don't know what it was, but I was really freaked out. But I'm better this morning."

"event","Last night I found out the lady who runs the children's church at my church (children's ministry is really big at Zion), resigned. She's leaving. And never coming back. A lot of people are leaving the church. It's really sad. And from the looks of the new schedule, the two ladies who do the nursery are leaving as well. For the next three months, the saturday's im scheduled, I'm alone. Which isn't technically legal. I think you're suppose to be 18 to be alone with the babies. Or any children like that. Meh. We havent had many lately. But it's still sad that everyone's leaving over land dispute. In a nutshell, the pastor sold some land belonging to the church (we're planning on expanding over the next few years) and didn't consult the elders or the financial advisors, and made his own company or something, and ended up making a profit off the land. (He said he was giving that money to the church). So a lot of people are upset about it and leaving. It's pretty sad. 

Other than my church falling to pieces, life's been alright. Can't think of anything exciting that's happened. Cept I got some girlscout cookies. mmmmm. lol."

THe kids are alright, though Katie, the 4 yr old is a bit of a head strong pill. J.J., the two year old, he's alright, though he's hard to understand. He seems to keep to himself a bit, but is quite hard the quite down for bed. But that's kids for ya. 

I haven't heard anything new on Walgreens yet. I'll call Briana about it soon and see if she can ask her mom what's going on. I'm running out of money! (Which was apparent when I over charged my debt card and they deducted twice from my savings account. ooops, hehe).

I finaly got my last check from Target. Only took me a week and a half to locate someone to help me. And low and behold, they had it at the service desk the whole time. 

School has been going alright. I really need to get my butt in gear with the Economics though. I just need to type everything out. Other than that, I should be good, as long as I get an A on the test on Friday. And my physics test. And English. Too many tests!

Since I had just gone to the bank, my wallet was out in the seat, along with my cell phone. I also have this habit of pulling too close to the gas pump. well, as I was attempting to get out, one of my shoes fell off. I thought ""oh well, i'll put it back on when I get back into my car"". Well, when I'm done, I go to open the car door. But..... I locked my keys in there. Along with my wallet which has the roadside assistance number and my id numer, cell phone and shoe. Yes, my shoe was still in the car. So I had to walk inside and ask for a phone, with one shoe. And I sat out there for half an hour waiting for my dad. With one shoe.

Possible job pending at Walgreens. The manager needs to call me back. I went in for the second half of my application to fill out (which can only be done at Walgreens), that's a good sign. 

i also have a pending job for monday nights. A lady at church knows someone who could use a babysitter on monday nights so she can return to school. She might be calling me about that.

Today, I helped catch a girl who was about to fall over (passing out again). She had passed out once already, and i was going to take her to the clinic, so i went and got her a wheelchair, and when she stood to move herself into it, she started falling. A guidance counselor helped me. It was really scary. I dont know her name, but could you all pray for her? She mentioned having surgery over christmas break, and I think it was to her knee, but I'm not sure. (she had crutches). I just hope she's ok."

It was a complete accident. She came out of no where. I'm so glad she's ok. She just needs a few weeks kennel rest, and she'll be fine. She's a year to two years old, and from the looks of it, was an abandoned house cat (the x-rays showed she had bones in her belly, birds and/or mice). Some of the neighbors in the neighborhood that I hit her in said they thought it belonged to a guy who just up and moved, leaving her behind. Well, she has a nice loving home now, though I wish it wasnt because I hit her with my car (twice >.<). I thought I'd tell everyone my exciting x-mas eve story."

Soooo, state law says if you work more than 4 and fewer than 7, you are REQUIRED to get one 15 PAID rest break. 

If you work more than 7 and less than 11, TWO rest breaks are REQUIRED BY LAW.

More than six hours, a lunch break is required. (half hour, unpaid). 

Soooooo, lets see. Last weekend, when i worked 7.5-8 hours (i cant remember). I didnt get my first 15 until 40 mins before my shift ended, and that was only because i sassed off to the head that was there. Otherwise, I wouldnt have gotten it. And then, of course, I got the lunch, but that's unpaid.

And then today and tuesday, I belive it was, I got no 15's. And today, I worked 6 hours and tuesday, it was 6 also, I believe. 

I said i wanted to work no more than 25 hours a week, soooo I'm working 35 next week. 

They expect me to put this job before school, family and church, which i refuse to do, but then again, I must. Tomorrow, I have to miss church again. Sunday, I must miss my cousin's birthday party. 

Oh, and did I mention that I'm not treated with much respect? I know I'm at the bottom of the food chain, but lord have mercy, I'm not to be treated like dirt. 

When a job leaves you so sore, you can barely lay in your bed and you come home crying almost everyday, you know something's wrong, yet my dad still wants me to keep this darn job. I'm in over my head and want to quit so bad. I hate it with a passion, and no one sees this (except the two greatest Aunts in the world, my aunt shiela and aunt bobbi).

I hate being expected to act like an adult, but I'm treated as a child when it comes to decision making. Decisions <i>I</i> should make for myself. I'm old enough to do that now.

"event","*sigh* I did it again. I blew up at someone I love. 

I yelled and argued, over something not too serious. It's just been a lousy week. 

I got so angry and upset, over just 3 hours. I guess it's my punctual/perfectionist coming out in me. 3 hours late.... an no warning.... *sigh* i need more control.

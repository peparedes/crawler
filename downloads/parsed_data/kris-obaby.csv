"event","Ok, i guess i should update, its been like weeks since i have because i kinda swore off of this thing, but whatever.  I can't sleep for some reason.  Every night for the past month i've been having trouble staying up and tonight i just don't want to go to sleep.  Oh well.  I'm so excited for the next two weeks:

Fri. May 13th-Prom
   we have a limo but no more hotel because it costs too much, instead, we're gonna just go to      afterparties and stuff till 5am

Sat May 14th
   Band Banquet, i hope everyone goes =\

Sun. May 15th
   My 8 month anniversary <3

Saturday May 21st
   Military Ball, and may i say, i am very excited b/c i bought the most GORGEOUS dress

Wed. May 25th
   Seniors' last day of school =( i'm probably gonna cry that day.

So there you have it. An update on my life for those of you who care.  I have so much on my mind right now but none of it is suitable for an online journal for everyone to see.  Nothing bad, just confusing.  Oh well, ::sigh::, i guess i'll go watch TV until i fall asleep.

"event","i had such a good day  yesterdat that it's worthy of an entry.  

i woke up at 8:00 and went to mcdonalds by 9:00, i got two free breakfast sandwiches ontop of the deluxe breakfast that i ordered, so i went to nellys to give them to her and cindy.  that intended 15 minute visit ended up being a visit from 9:00 am to almost 6:00 pm.  it was so much fun though.  we watched spanish porn(not really though) and hung out with a south american rich kid.  i have to visit nelly more often, so much fun and i brushed up on my spanish skills =\ 

then i went out to dinner with boy at tarpon bend.  it was fun, even though i had tomatoes in my chicken wrap.  we went back to his house for like 10 minutes and then i went to chili's to see nic and the ace people.  they're so much fun, i wish i had a job there.  from there me and nic went to the carnival and met up with snot kaitlin, pooks, bailey, ed, and later tyler.  we rode one ride like a million times b/c the carny liked us and then we rode  the ferris wheel.  it wasn't as bad this year (scary, i mean) because i got over my fear of ferris wheels last year when me, nic, fien, and chase rode it at the president's fest.  All three of them made me ride it last year and i was gripping onto that damn pole so hard.  Well, we got cotton candy and then i drove kaitlin and snot home and nicolette slept over.  fun times.  like i said, yesterday was SOO much fun! 

well, hope you liked my update. check for another one next month. lol.

"event","hmmm...i forgot what it's like to update in livejournal. its actually oddly exciting.  anyway, i'm having a good break, or at least until tonight.  i decided i would get started on the homework that my english and history teachers couldn't resist assigning,that is, until i looked for my history notebook and couldn't find my notebook.  i swear for the life of me that i put it in my guard bag and it stayed put until i got home from practice.  but, the next minute, my mom cleaned out my guard bag to take out the dirty clothes and my notebook is now suddenly  disappeared.  you probably don't care...alright...

anyhow, my break's been pretty good. i've spent a lot of time with boy and a lot of time with my family. i called yeff to hang out tonight but he never called me back. jerkface...

i still can't believe im updating.  

guard = pain in my ass (i can't wait to graduate) I go to check my email today for the first time this break, and (no disrespect to the email writers) my entire inbox was flooded with emails about more mandatory guard crap and reminders of the 8 hour practice i have breathing down my neck.  yuck.  

tomorrow's new year's eve, so like always, i'll spend it in miami somewhere with my big cuban family.  At least this year i'll have someone to kiss at midnight =)

Well, i <3 u all, and don't expect this updating nonsense to happen everyday.

"event","i got back from vacation saturday. it was so much fun.  i wouldve had alot more fun if i could've invited another friend's family, but i still had fun with my brother, his girlfriend, and my mom's friend's daughter's who are my age.  (confused yet?) i really did have a great time and it was the first time in a while that ive gone away and not wished that i was at home.  the cruise was good to figure out my personality and who i liked, didn't like, got along with, couldnt live without, and all that mumbo jumbo.  i got a nice tan out of it all too 8D . went to practice today and missing a week sure screws you up.  oh well, ill make up for it in the next few weeks to come.  THERE'S ONLY A FEW MORE WEEKS OF SUMMER LEFT AND I HAVE TO READ FOUR BOOKS AND WRITE TWO ESSAYS!!!! side note-sorry to the people i didnt tell i was going away for a week.  i left my cellphone at home on the charger and i had 18 missed calls. oh well,  now you know.  i kind of wish i was back on the cruise again, it was all new people and a fresh place to start....whatever...im gonna go read or call somebody or something now.  update later.

My favorite part was seeing my beautiful future husband, riley smith. i swear, i am going to marry him. if you dont know who he is, watch motocross on the disney channel or hes the cute guy on the tv show raising dad.  the rest of the weekend went something like this: hair done, nails done, military ball, shitty time, drove around, mcdonalds, got grounded, little cousins party, hw.  and yesterdya i left school early because i was on the verge of puking my life out. and i stayed home today.  and im about to eat some food, so i have to leave now, because food is more important than anything in the world...well, not more important than riley smith.

"event","i never knew being a girl could have so many downsides:
(listed in order of worst to least worst)
1. birth
2. periods
3. cramps
4. bloating
5. tight clothes
6. fuckin boys being fuckin stupid
7. fuckin boys causing problems
8. friends of the SAME SEX! CUZ THEY SUCK!!!!!!

i wish i could be a boy, or eliminate all of my friends that are girls, cuz girls=drama=hell!!!! friends that are boys are so much better...wait, i take that back, friends that are boys usually end up liking you...or you liking them, causing uncomfortableness and chaos.  i just want no friends. i wanna stay in a room with a refridgerator filled with my favorite foods (twizzlers + taco bell + fries), and ryan wall for sexual purposes (hey, a girl cant just NOT get some!)  anybody else wanna be my sex toy? hell ya...basically, friends suck.

I still havent signed up for my classes next year. that cant be good. i need to go tomorrow no matter what.  maybe i shouldnt take precal cuz i have a 71 in algebra 2!!!! i studied 3 goshdarn hours for a test we took on monday, took it, thought i did goodk, then today she tells me i got a 65 on the damn test,bringing my 73 to a 71. damn it man. 

anybody know how to do all that fancy schmancy html stuff that makes ur journal all cool and such? i would really appreciate if someone helped me out... i g2g, ill probably come on later tonight and update some more.

(you cant put any bad words or profane things cuz they'll delete it when they screen it.) i miss chase so much.  i really need to see him soon or ill go nuts.  i have this huge math test tomorrow that i need to get an a on or else i have no chance of bringing my grade up in that class.  im so worried. i have a 72.5 in that classs (meanwhile others who are smart have 13%s and 25%s) and i wanna bring it up to a high b or even better an A.  yeah, i know its a long shot, but a girl can dream, cant she? wow im such a loser, im dreaming i get a's.

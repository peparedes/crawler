Where I'm concerned: When I'm listening to certain songs, I exactly remember the day or the moment that created that special memory I'll connect with it to the end of my life. How the air smelled on a sunny day, what clothes a person wore. When I was 15 there were certain songs that gave me the feeling of being not alone, that could express what I wasn't able to express. That's why music always had a special place in my life. It never was only sound; only words - it was so much more. And that's not even touching the visual side. Then if you're hearing something like this about yourself - even if people didn't understand at all what I originally meant with the song - it's the most precious thing"" - Trent Reznor.</FONT></STRONG> </FONT><BR></EM>"

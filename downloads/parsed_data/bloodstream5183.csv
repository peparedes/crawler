"event","My Life, is different, but my feelings are still the same. Sitting in one place and only having one thing to look forward to tomorrow-work. I feel betrayed but yet I feel like I have accomplished something, I have a job, I'm going to school, and I'm getting my life straight....but at the same time....there is something so much more that means something to me, my home...There is only one thing that i wish i had...and that is all. it seems that everyday is the same for me...I go to work, I eat and I sit around and watch tv, and to me..i feel like I should be doing something so much more than that. I want to change things, and  the way I live.. I hate waking up every morning knowing that I am 300 miles away from my family, friends, and of course the one and only love I have - Brandon. It has been 6 months since I  have been gone..and it feels like a year..and to think that I'm probably staying here until school is out...it sucks...My future seems to be the only thing I look forward to...not right now. Everything has a meaning, and I know the one reason why I was...but now..I have no reason. I've been lied to...I was suppose to come home this summer, a promise that my father broke, and not only did he break that promise but he broke my heart and not only  heart but everyone else in Georgia that loves me and just wants me to come home. People wait not only people...my family asks me everyday almost "" We miss you.....We just want you back....WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME DANII?!!"" Do you know how much that hurts me to know that I was the one person that kept so many people happy and not so hurt..and now those people...they are hurt from me. I feel like not only my dad has let me down...but I let myself down, I let all those people down....and that's what means the most to me.Why am I up here? I seem to no longer know...what can I not possibly do down there that I did up here? 
 It seems every time i try to explain this to my dad he just doesn't care, like its all about him...and never about me. i've done so much for him , i passed school, i got a job for him...and the only thing i wanted in return, he blew off as a joke. why can't he take me seriously...i'll never know. but besides all this...i don't know what i'm going to do. thanks for reading. 
love you, Danii"

"event","Here's my lovely week. My dad checked himself into a rehab...again. He came home yesterday and the only thing i could think about is how long it will last. God, i have sucha horrible headache. Why do i seem to be so sad? no one said life wasn't an  easy game to play. I'm just confused, no longer do i have the desire to think about all the bullshit that has happened to me in the past couple of days. I'm tired, tired of the bullshit, the lies, and most of all...tired of getting my hopes up. I don't know what to do, i feel like i need to go to a shrink. and at least for them to give me a pill to numb the pain. im through, through of lies, and being controlled.and right now, deep down inside, the only thing i really feel right now is sad....i want to fucking cry."

The Ponytail Parades 

three sleepless nights
this isn't how its supposed to be
but you are so good at taking your time
to get back to me
i will wait for you forever,
if you would just ask me
i thought that i could change you
but you changed me
but it doesn't feel right
holding someone else's hand
together on phone line
and living at two opposite ends
its scares me to think that you could find takers other than me and better than me
but you're head is elsewhere and im talking enough for both of us
when will you see it's not so easy for me
your careless and whispered insulting and bruising
and i thought that you said 
things were improving
these laces are untied
but my feet are still walking away
(i fall from you eyes, your eyes i trusted, you said forever)
i never thought that you could say these words 
is this really happening? 
i never thought that you could say these words 
is this really happening? 
(don't say...) 
i never thought that you could say these words 
is this really happening? 
(don't say that we can...) 
i never thought that you could say these words 
is this really happening? 
(don't say that we can still be...) 
i never thought that you could say these words 
is this really happening? 
(don't say that we can still be friends) 
erase my name from this page
how can you take all these days (what is inside of me what have i done) 
and tow them away (is this the only way that you will notice me) 
as i sit here waiting for you (dead words for closed ears all this is sung for you)
i stay upnights (if you are still pretending this is what's right) 
until stars leave the sky (why cant you look at me can you only see)
knowing what my dreams can take away ( sides, your side, can take away) 
walk away from me this night is done



I listened to this the other day, and it reminded me of micheal. how he might see things. and in the same way how i see things. im sorry micheal . smile..for me..."

"event","I'm back from Georgia finally. it seems like everyone is moving on with things. micheal seems to be happy...and has met a new girl...im happy for him. he needs someone whos better than me..and obviously she is.....and donnie told me about him and terran , i hope things work out for him and her. im so glad everybody has found someone. i am so sorry mike for not calling, my message you left on my cell got erased and i got back to georgia so i wouldnt have long distance calling anyways. 
 i was planning on going to the concert but it seems mike has some new girl that i assum he likes so yeah. i mean......i guess what i want from him..is to be happy...and even though he was happy with me i think he deserves a lot better. i mean....i did get jealous when he was talking about that girl but i guess its for the best. he deserves someone that will make him happy ...and doesnt do drugs.

my sister had her baby , its a boy. and im a aunt! im so happy. i see it as the most beautiful baby in the world. until i can have mine lol. anyways im so happy for her.

me and brent are like really close friends now. its really weird, i mean hes going through a lot of stuff right now and i guess im like the only one he has right now. i mean....to actually be there for him and two others i know about. but for some reason i feel im the only one he really talks to about his relationship problems.i just want him to be happy.

i've hanging out with a lot of my older friends from south than my friends from north. i mean i actually think its better for me. because terrie is going through a lot of shit right now and i seriously dont want to get involved with it, but as a friend...i must be there for her through thick and thin.

I was thinking about commenting mike on some of his journal entrys but i decided not to. i think it would be better to not try to say much to him.....to at least make him happy. i dont think i make him very happy anymore. 

i think going to north carolina was i good idea for me. i see things a lot different now. i mean im actually thinking all the bullshit is over, well i mean i know its not over but it's improving. and thats all i want to see right now . ... im thinking of not righting journal entrys on livejournal anymore and start putting them on myspace because i dont think livejournal is very secure. i dont knwo i guess i just dont trust it...and like anyone reads these journals of mine anyways....except someone...

i have very exciting news and yet upsetting news. i dont think i can tell anyone and i dont think i want anyone to know. not even kat knows........i think people will just flip out on me and everything will go bad again.

sooner or later though i will post this news, but until i know for sure i know that some people have moved on with their lives.....thats when i will say.
until then i must go and update a lot more on stuff. later - Danii"

All day we looked for pot. well i called bean, and he said he could get us some, and that he was at brandons house. so me and kat go over there and, it was so weird being in front of brandon out of all the nights where i thought about him. and how i use to think of ways to upset him. i sighed. me and him are cool now and i guess friends. me and marie talked a couple of days ago for like 2 hours and it was great we talked about the weirdest shit but it was great. i have been so blazed this summer. anyways. well we left brandons house empty handed but later on me and kat met up with bean  and bought a 20. but of course i always get a little extra. anyways we went to the sand plant and smoked a blunt and a couple of bowls and went swimming. then we went back to kats house and smoked more pot and went swimming. then we got out, got dressed smoked some more pot and then went over to ziggys house. there we ate food and smoked some more pot. then we back to kats house and hung out and ended up smoking acouple of more bowls because we were pissed because we lost the keys to kats car. so i decided to go to sleep. then the next morning i woke up and smoked a cigarette and three bowls. then we went to ziggys to eat some food and went back to kats house to smoke a blunt and then go swimming again. then we got out and got dressed and smoked some more. then we went back to ziggys, ate more food and went back to kats in the rain to watch harold and kumar go to white castle then i had to go home so by then my high wore off and i decided to write this journal. well i must go. later - Danii"

I have been very upset and sad about micheal leaving.....and it was very stressful for me to let him go...
i had been thinking before he left that....how i wouldnt be able to stand being with him when i can't see him..i cried.then i went to terries house to get stoned and think it ouT. later on he called ...and i was wasted..and that made me feel so bad.....and i told him that i didnt want to be him during the long distance relationship because...it would be hard..i didnt want to hurt him..and he said he was fine..but i could tell in the sadness in his voice , he wasnt fine.after the call...i was so upset. i felt like i had just did the worst thing ever in my whole entire life. then later on when i was feeling the worst..donnie shows up..and then ""wants to talk to me about me and him "" when i knew right there and now that i wasnt in any condition to want to talk to him. then he startedtalking and actually cried in front of me..and made me feel even worse than what i did.then i cried again while he was doing something. then he came back and shoved a lot of shit in my face , asking why i dont want to be with him. and i told him the i didnt want him and that i just broke up with micheal. and he asked me if i wanted to be with him and i said i did but hes gone....and he said then what do you want and i told him i didnt know and then he started bitching at me a lot more. and i got very pissed and upset and i started shaking really badly and chained smoke the rest of the night. there is just so much stressed upon me and i dont know what to do about half of . i dont know what to do right now. but all i did do is right this stupid journal entrie and think a lot of shit out. well im gonna go...later.-Danii"

"event","Hm, i waited pretty much all night to talk to mike because i felt like i couldnt sleep if i didnt talk to him . so i waited he finally called at like 5 o clock in the morning and i was in the shower. ( yes i take random showers like around 3 o clock in the morning) anyways he left like a message on my fone and it was pretty cute and i felt like i had to call him back so i did. then we talked on the fone for like hours it seemed like..until my fone went dead then i called him back on my cell fone.and told him to call me around twelve. surely that he called and i was asleep and didnt hear the fone ring. but then he called back around one and i finally heard it . i talked to him pretty much off and on . he stoped by last night to see me and we had our first kiss, i t was grea tyou should of been there to see it.....like larry did lol. j/k. anyways, yeah i was so happy to see him last night and i seriously did not want him to leave but i also didnt want to get in trouble so i had to. i went to brookes house to day and chilled with her for like 15 mins and headed back home. 
 I'm suppose to go to my dads house today and leave Sat. to go to North Carolina. anddont get me wrong i am going to love it up there i get to see some old friends and shit like that but i am really going to miss micheal and all my very close friends. but yeah. instead of staying at my dads tonight i think i might just go to kats and like try to go to a movie with mike. i want to see him SOOOOOO bad before i have to go , ill like explode or somethign if i dont. but yeah. im waiting for him to pack stuff up and stuff. i dont know why but i want some Arby's really bad. i think im going to try and get my dad to have lunch there . 
 Kat came by the house today and stoped by why i was packing up and she seems like she really wants to hang out and i really want to hang out with her. it seems like a month since i have seen her. which is kind of weird because i use to spazz out if i didnt see her in a minimum of two days. so yeah its kind of different. but i seem ever since i moved and she ot a car and etc. that im glad we arn't so close. i mean yeah i missed hanging out with her all the time....but after a while i noticed that we were pretty much blindly getting sick of eachother. but anyways.
 I LOVE EVERYONE AND I WILL MISS EVERYONE! i will call pretty much eveyone everyday just sothey know im ok. because like kat and meranda and so forth they know my past with my dad ...and it wasn't realy good and the fact im going to be with him for like a week......well lets just say it's a scary thought. lets just be glad i dont have a gun or anything like that. because im sure in the past time when i have stayed with him i would of like shoot myself or something.but anyways....im still deciding if i want larrys subs or Arbs...they are both so good...and i want both...but then again i havent had Arbys since school has been out and i use to eat arbys at least 2 a week...so maybe i should eat there for a change.

 I feel like everyday me and mike are getting closer, and i find that a really good thing because i have had any doubts about this relationship at all...and every other relationship i have had this year i have doubted. i think the only that was serious was with howard and after he got way into drugs..i just thought there was no hope.
anywyas, im really happy for a lot of people. i feel kind of bad for brooke because me and her were like always the single ones in the group together and we were so proud of it..and now that i have a boyfriend...she feels so lonely. and when im gone this week shes going to be even more lonely because iwont be able to walk to her house everyday and talk about a lot of shit and stuff. not to mentoin her birthday is on monday and i was so up to like surprising her with a birthday wake-up and writing her a song on bass and shit like that but a lot of stuff has gone by and i have been pretty busy. i pretty much already written her a song, but it like all in my head i need to write it down. maybe on that 3-4 hour journey to N.C. i can copy it down and sing it to her on her birthday lol. i know it sounds weird but thats what she wants me to do. which also kind of freaks me out but i love that girl to death you know?


then i wanted to go to kasies house today wecause i thought it would of been a lot easier to see mike but she doesnt have any transportation so.....it wouldnt really work out and i dont want to end up going there and something happening ....its just i dont like to go over there because of certain people. and the problem with guys hitting on me all the time over there and shit like that and i know if i go over there im going to get drunk and im not going to ruin this relationship with mike because i think i would have to like runaway and never let anyone see my face again or something . it would just be a horrible thing to think about and i dont want to lose mike. i think i am really really lucky to be with him and he thinks the same about me. i really to tell you the truth dont want him to go to Jacksonville, but i know it is for the best so i have to just live with it.but yeah  i got to go. my dad is on his way and i have to get a lot of shit togethe rand sutff . i lvoe you guys. later .

"event","OK, where to start. I'll start off with yesterday afternoon before i went to Kasie's house. I ate a great dinner with my loved family and then i was off. I got to Kasie's house and someone was there.....Chris...I don't have a problem with Chris but I don't realy trust him. Me and him have had our time.....but out of it all, I didn't really want to see him, I think it was because I said someone else on my mind. Me and Kasie sat around and watched homevideos of her when she was like 4. It was so cute I wanted to keep them.lol. Then Mike called and said he was on his way. At the time I wasn't sure what time it was and when it would be possible to see him but i didn't care , i wanted to see him and out of it all he stoped by. He gave me a few things which was so sweet of him and i got a picture of us. i think the picture could of been redone but it didn't matter to me, as long as i had a picture of me and him. I'd show it to you guys but im not quite sure how to do that yet. After Mike left, Chris stayed for a couple of mins and then left to go home. I was glad there was no reason i should of felt comfortable in his presence. After he left I kept thinking about Mike and was wondering if he was going to call me tonight. I realy did want him to but he didnt. which was ok....i'm sure he had a lot on his mind. Well, Kasie's neighbor Ben came over and we all watched porn and i smoked the rest of Ben's K.B. When I got smoking Kasie tried to get me to help her look for some alcohol but i was kind of out of it, but i tried to help. Then Me and Kasie Decided to watch Jackass the movie and play skateboarding videogames.( which i admit is lame and stupid ) lol. I started at 11 , with a whole pack of newports and ended the night with none. It made me so mad this morning when i woke up because i wanted a cigarette so bad, so i smoked a black n mild instead. Then i ended up going back to sleep and waking up with two bronco cigarettes :( which is gross, because i believe bronco are like the grosses cigarettes anyone could put to their mouth besides Doral. eh. Well, I finally got dressed and so forth and decided to hit the road. Anyways...i was waiting on a fone call. Out of it all, i have had a pretty good time. I saw the one person i wanted to see, and i had a great time too, but until tomorrow. I'm out. Later. - Danii"

"event","I've had a very short day. I woke up at 4 in the afternoon. It was weird. My mom knocked on my door all 

worried about me. I think she thought I was doing drugs again. I don't mind that shes worried about me 

though. I mean it's good to know someone cares about you. I weighed myself today and saw i have lost 5 

pounds in like a week,it was kind of weird too.


 Brooke called me at like 11 in the morning and I felt so bad because I told her I would meet up with her  

to bum a smoke from her, and like I was pretty much a bitch when she called, but it wasn't her lost. I got 

what I deserved...nothing. 


 Then, Kasie called wondering what I was doing today. While I was asleep, I told her to call me later. 

Finally I woke up, and like 5 mins later Kasie called back. I talked to her for about 10 mins about what 

we were going to do today because I wanted to hang out with her...but I also wanted to see Mike . ( but i 

didn't tell her i wanted to hangout with him). About 15 mins later Mike calls me up asking whats up, and i 

was happy because i didn't think he was going to call. 


 I really do think if he didn't talk to me last night and keep me company I would of like lost it or 

something. Since me and Donnie got in a fight. ( which i'd rather not talk about because i respect him and 

promised him i wouldnt tell anybody). but anyways, I really hope to see mike tonight. He suppose to stop 

by Kasie's house tonight to come see me. I really hope hes seriously coming to see me, it would make me so 

happy.


 If only he knew how much he makes me feel. I can't really explain it but Jasmin said she understood. I 

feel that me and him will become pretty close. 

 Anyways, I think I'm doing a lot better, and made a right desicion about Donnie. I think if I never met 

Mike. I would of made the worst desicion of my life. It's hard to explain, because none of you know what 

I'm going through right now. But thats how bad things were going. I looked at my sides today to see if the

scratches are healing, they're doing better but it will be a little while before all the bruises heal. 

I hate to have marks on my body ,they remind me of bad things in my life, and the consequences i get for 

making the wrong desicion. Because lets face it, lately i haven't been makeing a lot of good desicions, 

but i do think i have made one good one (to call mike). 

 Kasie seems to be having some trouble, i was plaining on getting drunk with her tonight. But if mike does 

show up i dont want to make a bad impression. but i might just have a couple of shots, which wont hurt me 

at all. If anything i need a few shots. 

 Me and Jasmin have seem to have became real close. We talk to eachother pretty much everyday now. We use 

to hang out like all the time. So its kind of like old times , but we have to be a lot more careful because

her mother like always has her eyes on jasmin. And second....i dont want to make her parents think im a 

bad influence. 
 
I talked to Brandon the other day. He was so shocked that I called. He kept telling me that i was so 

pretty and shit. which was the wrong thing to say with me. I mean we didnt even officially break up, he 

just decided not to bother me anymore but stop calling and think it was over. he said the only problem 

between us is my age. i mean hes 17 years old. yeah there is a 3 year age difference so what? but i really

don't want to get caught up in my past like i was. 


I mean i wasn't really happy. not that i am now... but thats because im alone. and to not be alone takes 

time unless you want lust. and i dont want that. i want 

love. i know that i have my whole entire life to find the one person i love and that  i havent even been 

through half of my life. but to think about how happy i would be....and to not feel so bad...i would love

to be in love right now. to spend the rest of my life with one person....makes me feel so great.


 Well I pretty much wrote about everything that has happened in the past 4 days . lol. i guess ill talk

to you all later. love you all .

"event","OK, my ear offically hurts right now. lol. its aiight though ill live. yeah i had a pretty rough day. i don't even think i want to talk about it. i think the only thing that made me feel happy was talking to mike. hes so sweet. anyways, i dont know what to do about a lot of shit. i just need to slow down and stay calm. i guess so much stuff has just happened at once. i've been really tired and i havent eaten very good. *sigh* i dont know what to do. i mean i try to eat and i try to sleep. but i seem not to. and its weird after i talked to mike a ate like pretty much half a hamburger(which is a meal to me) and i haven't ate a whole meal in at least 3-4 days. and now that i have finished talking to him....i think i could actually get some sleep . well im gonna go i have so much i need to update on. night. - danii"

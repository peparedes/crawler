"event","My weekend has been pretty damn cool, other than a few minor bumps in the road.

I had practice Friday. It was great and my passes and serves have been totally rockin. I only missed 3 out of my 25 serves in practice. The only bump with that was I blew a blood vessel in my arm (I'm loving the broken blood vessels lately) and its purplish-yellow now. I still play on it though.

After Friday's practice I went home and took a hour-long bubble bath. It was lavander (my favorite scent) and it was REALLY hot. I couldn't have moved out of that tub even if I had wanted to.

After I got out, dried off, got dressed, and almost fell asleep on the couch Nic showed up. He and I chilled until 10:30 and then he headed home. It wasn't a long visit but he and I were both so tired that we just layed there and cuddled and talked. I think it was actually the best time I've ever had, just listening to him talk to me and being next to him.

Nic left and I stayed up for about 30 more minutes then I decided to crash and it took me about 8 minutes to fall asleep versus the usual 30.

Today I woke up and walked out of my room into the kitchen as usual, made some oatmeal and plopped down at the kitchen counter to eat and talk to my mom. My dad walked in and showed me his newest gun (he has about 15 lol) and my mom was all pissy because the guns are so expensive. Last time he had got a gun she told him every time he got a gun she got new jewelry. So we went to the jewelry store and mom got a new gold ring with a...I forgot what its called....a purple stone. Yeah...and then we went home. 

Once we were home I played my guitar, broke a string, got pissed, and made then take me to the shop to get strings. So I ended up getting new strings and 2 CD's *laughs*. I got Black Sabbath and Dave Matthews Band. 

After that I asked if I could go shopping so mom and I went to the mall and I got
1. an adorable black dress from Hot Topic, its short and pleated and it has bondage straps and X's on the front pockets and its safety pinned all over
2. A purple fishnet shirt
3. a black beater with studs across the front
4. a new Spartan coat (GO MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY!)
5. 2 new buttons for my hoodie
6. 7 pairs of earrings

Yeah, life is good sometimes."

"event","Well then! Ben came over last night, it was...weird...to put it kindly. not the best time I've ever had but yeah, it was cool.

My dad wouldn't let me leave the house so I went crazy and trashed my room and other stuff. It was not my best moment. After that Chelses, Lauren, and I went to Midnite Video and rented Jeepers Creepers 2, American Wedding, and Freaky Friday. We only got through JC2 and part of American Wedding.

After everyone left I got online and talked to Nic for a while, I miss him so much! He's not coming home until Friday, which sucks really badly but what cn you do? I told him not to worry about it and to have a good time.

Thats about all that happened yesterday. All thats happened so far today is a couple of crazy dreams and I played my accoustic to my moms friend over the phone, yeah, whatta par-tay.

Must dash,
Jamie"

"event","I did wonder if I had a thing for a guy I met in Florida, but now that I've talked to Nic I realize I don't. I really like Nic and I just could not break up with him no matter what. I wonder sometimes if he feels the same (like he really likes me) or if he is...I unno, but I still like him.

The basketball game was great, Nic didn't come but it was all good. I hung out with all of my friends and I got up once to go stand with my friends and I guess my cousin considers that ditching, maybe I did it more but hey, they could've followed me so it doesn't bother me. 

We've had 2 snow days in a row, 8 inches of snow, and so far its been as boring as watching educational TV shows. Gah.

Well I g2g, talk to all of you later. Bye!"

"event","So my chittlins, how bees it? Just kidding. Hmm. Man, on Friday I had the flu. It was gruesome. I threw up so much that I burst a blood vessel in my eye. My whole eye is turning purple. I'm scared I'ma go blind.

I got my guitar. It's the bomb diggity. I can play a part of Ironman. Hey, I'm proud. My goal is Billy Talent. Cross your fingers for me.

School sucks dogs for quarters (Detroit Rock City, awesome movie, get it if you haven't!). I have to copy the whole constituion by tomorrow morning if I want to pass Social Sciences. Gah.

On the bright side, Nic might (MIGHT!) come over tonight and if he does he might come to the basketball game with me, Lauren, and Chelsea. Oh fun!"

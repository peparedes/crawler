I'm not going to beach week, I don't give a fuck about it anymore. 

We say I love you just about everyday.  Sometimes the words are wispered as we fall asleep at night; sometimes they're spoken at the end of a phoen conversation or accompanied by a quick kiss as we rush out the door.  The words are always there, but sometimes we forget to thing about how much they really mean.  Everytime you hear me say those three little words, I want you to remember that they're coming from the bottom of my heart.  I want you to remember that I love you for everything you are and for everything I am with you. I want you to remember that you're the best person I've ever known adn I feel so lucky to have you in my life. I want you to remember that true love is forever and there is no love truer than the love I feel for you.  I want you to remember that you're the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me,
my happy ending,
my dream come true,
my friend and my love all wrapped up in one.
I love you

I don't know what to say, I have a boring life, and I really don't feel like writing every detail of my boring day.  All that needs to be said is 2 hour nap today was AMAZING. I am gonna do that everyday during break. 

everyone's gifts are wrapped so bad, danas yours is by far the worst wrapping job i have ever done i am so sorry. Hopefully it will make you laugh, I had to use like three sheets to cover it all. I'm pretty bad.

"event","metal health today, yes! except not really because i spent the whole day going aroudn to doctors offices and gettin xrays and junk. no one knows whats wrong except that its something wrong with the rotator cuff, i could have told them today. so then i got to go to tryouts to tell greg i couldnt swim for two weeks, he was accepting of it and is just gonna take my uss times. It makes me really happy because yesterday i just felt stuck like i couldn't find a good solution, i love swimming and the people too much to not be on it but it hurts to much to swim right now. So in two weeks we get to re-evaluate how i feel, but i still get to be on the team, yay! I can't imagine just not swimming again, that was too hard freshman year. I just hope it not a serious problem and in two weeks it will be all better.

I'm tired of inviting myself places. I understand occasionally i have plans, but it is still nice to be included. I understand now finally, no one else was good at managing their time so i won't either, i get it. great way for senior year to be...

"event","this week has been hell, but no day has quite been as bad as today. Teachers are smart and they like to swamp the seniors the last week of the quarter so we fail and they have alot of work and our grades die. Monday, it was so long ago i cant even remember. its only wednesday and i cant remember monday thats how busy i was. OH yeah i went to cassells after school for 2 hours to spirit wear stuff for swim team then i get hoem and have an insane amount of hw, and i have to do spirit wear for crew too. 
tuesday was my birthday and it just made it ok. thank you everyone. i love all my friends, you made my birthday great. and the flowers were gorgeous and they made my birthday ten times better. thank you. you make me forget all the shit going on.
AND NOW TO TODAY... i wont even go into school and how i couldnt stay awake not even during our seminar. it all begins after school when i go to talk to my counselor which actually was helpful because it kind of destressed me and we got things figured out and it made me happy. but then i went to anatomy and failed the retake of the test i got 40% on...ahfjkfd i get home from school and all i do is work on that stupid government project. i hated that thing and i was stupid to wait to start till alst night but i got it in at 10:40. 
tonight shawn and i got in the biggest fight i think we have ever gotten in. it was the worst thing of my life and i cant handle thinking about it. it hurts me so much, i was mean and he was even more mean. it kills me. i can't even put it into words. But then i went outside, in the freezing cold, all bundled up, and watched the eclipse, i swear i just stood there for 10 minutes. something has never been so gorgeous to me or so fitting. <i>it was the perfect ending to a crappy day</i>  it makes me feel so small, and it was 10 minutes where i actually wasnt crying or stressing, i was watching something i had absolutely no control over, and it was amazing. i couldnt fuck it up, or make it made, it was how it was, it was perfect."

"event","So as much as i went into last night dreding and complaining, I actually had fun. Not so much at dinner, especially since gillian was 30 minutes late. And i wasn't feeling great so my stomach couldn't handle the Indian food, which i usually love, but just didn't want last night, I think I ate two peices of chicken. It would have been fun if I felt better and if well i was closer with more people. So i got home around 1 I guess and ate pizza, that is me. 

But at the dance I did have fun. We have gotten a lot closer in two weeks, so it was almost better last night then at his.

So, last night i met his dad. I had already met him mom and she is the cutest little asian mom. she's really short like me, i love it. But he had freaked me out to meet his dad because he had told me all these stories. So then we are there are his dad asks when my curfew is, my parents really hadn't set a curfew, they asked that i called if i was gonna go to an after party, but they didn't really care too much. So he asked and i had no idea what to say and in my head i was like oh shit what should i say i shouldnt say no curfew but i dont want it to be to early, and 12:30 just came out of my mouth. see the reason i didn't know what to say is because scott told me about how his dad didn't trust him and was all anal and checked things out (he's a military dad). meh, but i still didn't get home till around 1ish which means scott got home after 1. oh well."

Went to Dave Matthews Concert with Traci. We met two guys there. They are cool. IT was the best one yet. He played amazing songs. I can't even put into words how amazing it was. incredible. that is all i have to say.

Leo's back. That month away fucked us up. I don't know whats going on. He's always playing football lifting at the gym or with his friends. I give up. He says he still has feelings for me. And he says he just always likes to take things slow because he wants to know the relationship will last more then 1 month. I don't know what to think. He has all these things he needs to do before he goes out with a girl. It just doesn't seem normal. thats my life for you. just when you think you have it good something has to fuck it up. Who knows.

I mean yeah he made up for it this morning, but still. 
I miss him most when I am alone. I miss him most when everyone asks me about it. I miss him most when i hear love song or i listen to his CD. I  miss him most at work. I miss him most when he's the first thing i think of when i wake up.
I should be happy though, he is coming back. I get to see him again. I'm so afraid he's gonna meet someone else. That is always how my life has been. I have so many doubts, and i should just be happy he's in my life and that he will come back.

To everyone who lost someone this past week, my heart goes out to you. Everyone is watching out for us now.

It was great. Saturday I went to the pool with gillian and got tan, but unfortunately gillian is not burned. maybe it will turn to tan, I hope so for her sake. then i had to work, and I didnt want to because i was suppposed to be at the varsity banquet since i lettered. But no, no one would work for me. But Leo came to visit me even though he wasn't working, so he stayed the last hour and ordered food and gave me some once i got cut around 930. I couldn't believe he did that, he hates work, he never goes in when he doesnt have to. So we went to twon center, but left after a while. And he took me to his old neighborhood where there is a lake and we layed ont he dock and talked alot and yeah and it was great, except i got pretty cold. He makes me really happy. HES A FUCKING SURFER! what woudl be more perfect for me?? but the sad thing is on the 20th he leaves for hawaii for the Billabong invitational, where he could get signed and become professional. So at frist thought you think awesome! yeah but no, he'll be gone till the 19th of July. Thats one fucking month. I don't know how i'll deal with it. I hated not seeing him for one day. And hawaii is so far away I don't know how we will talk because its insanely long distance. AND he'll be aroudn all the hot surfer girls, and i'm not. :(  So i need to be distracted during that month. The worst during that month will be when I am at work. It's ok thought, I'm gonna make the last week he's here the best it can be. Damn school will get in the way."

<P>Friday was good. I had a fun time shopping and hanging out with 3 guys all night. It made me laugh. It made me happy. It felt like summer.</P>
<P>Saturday was the perfect day most of the day. I went to the pool, hung out with Gillian and Juila, It was great. Got some sun, went swimming, perfect start to the pool. And then it got even better, around 3 Dana and JIMMY came to the pool. I was so happy I can't even put it into words. HE IS SO FUCKING HOT. His hair is the perfect length, and it has a little bit of curl at the end, and he had soem facial hair. God I just wanted to fuck him when i saw him right then. Then we went driving aroudn aimlessly together, smoked some black and milds, I love the smell of those. People say smoking is a turn off, god that made me want him more then I already did. We listened to great music it was just great. Then we went to town center and we were walking around, talking about our lives, and funny stories, got in an argument about the Yankees vs Red Sox. It was fun, we were laughing. Then we were talking about us, <STRONG><FONT size=4>AND HE HAS A FUCKING GIRLFRIEND</FONT></STRONG>. her name is natasha adn they ahve been dating for 2 1/2 weeks. and it gets better, she is leaving in a month or so for college, IN MINNESOTA! so autoimatically i think awesome she's leaving, they will break up. BUT NOOOOO, he says he doesn't know if they will break up. WHAT THE FUCK, why would he stay with a girl that hasnt been a really serious relationship if he will only see her once a fuckign year and he can see me like every weekend. So he doesnt know if they will break up, he doesn't know what will happen with us, he said he still has some feelings for but ""they aren't like 9th grade"" well thanks that really cleared it up. NOT REALLY.&nbsp; So yeah, of course I'm still gonna hang out with him, I don't wanna loose him totally, but it sucks. And I hate my life, and I hate him for doing this to me, even though i don't wanna deprive him of being happy. But why can't he be happy with me. Am I just all of a sudden his fall back girl? after everything we have been through. We have known each other since what 2nd grade. We have made it through so much, and all his moves, and deaths, and getting in trouble and distance. What does she have that I don't have?? I wanna be the only girl for him again. <STRONG>THIS KILLS ME.&nbsp; </STRONG>Part of me wants to think that of course they will break up, and i will have been there through everything, so of course he will want to be with me. But my life hasn't worked out that way yet, why would it work out that way now. And again, am I just his fall back girl or what. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some jealous bitch that didn't want him and kept turning him away but still wanted him to love me and now that he has a girlfriend wants him. I never stopped wanting him. I never stopped having feelings for him. Does he know that. I tried to tell him. I guess there is nothing to do but wait it out. It sucks, and when i think about it, it&nbsp;makes me sad and depressed and angry, but what can i do, hire a hit man to kill natasha.&nbsp;I wish. I hope she's ugly, with ugly hair too. <EM><FONT color=#ff0000>I HATE MY LIFE AND IT HATES ME</FONT></EM></P>

"event","My friend told me that a moment of clarity would come. A perfect pristine glorious moment when nothing can be touched. She said that that moment would come and everything would be just as it should be. And at that moment I would know exactly what i want. But if i don't know or i dont ever ger that moment of clarity. Or what if it doesnt come for days or weeks or months. Am I just supposed to drag people down with me. Make them just as confused as I am thats not fair, is it? THey already have the strength and peice of mind i long for. They don't deserve to be brought down to my level.
My friend told me that day would come when I wasn't confused and When I would be patient. She told me I should remember that day and never forget the serenity of it. But what if I don't remember that day and soon after I forget. Will I have learned from my mistakes or gained from my achievements? ""Patience is a virtue"" someone once said. Maybe they were in the same position as me.
My friend told me to go get closure. But what if I don't want this to be the end. Maybe this is only the beginning. How am I supposed to know. Does this take me right back to that moment of clarity? It is one big circle. A never ending circle. One moment of clarity and then a moment of confusion. Maybe we never know, and that is the excitement of life.
It's my grandpa's 80th birthday in a few weeks. I hope when its my turn to turn 80 I can look back and laugh. Maybe by that time I will have figured out this game of life. Maybe I won't, but I want to be able to look back at the scrapped knees, banged heads, High School Drama, and broken hearts, and know it all turned out the way it was meant too. Because everythign happens for a reason, whether it is good or bad. And that is just what i need to remember, whether I have clarity or patience or closure, or none of those, everything happens for a reason. Enjoy it.

After I wrote that, I got that moment of clarity I wanted. Things may not make perfect sense still. But I'm ok with that, and i said i don't have control over my life, and maybe I don't, but that just makes it more exciting, so i should stop trying to control it. I'm happy. I am happy. I just wish that this person i know could be happy too. I know you're not necessarily depressed, but I want only good things for you. I <3 you, you know who you are..."

""There's a part of him that was a cultural revolutionarey and part of him that was a classic song craftsmen."" Danny Goldberg

So how does it feel now, when you're driving down the road at night past Blockbuster and Applebee's, and, just as Trapt's ""Headstrong"" fades out on the radio, you hear those first strums of ""Smells like teen spirit""? Is it awesome? Does it totally fuckign rock? Or does it feel a bit jarring and sad? When anything by Nirvana comes on the radio, you almost have to pull over-still. 

This isn't religion we're talking about, it's pop culture: prepackaged, market-tested, owned and directed by massive corporations that exploit the desires and neuroses of a young and impressionable public. Still, memory lingers, just like the word itself in the chorus of ""Come as You Are"" And, that gohst is out there. Whether it's sad, pissed off, or exuberant, it's not going away until we do."

So then her dad was at the kitchen table and we were talking and having a conversation about J Lo and how he likes ""Jenny on the block"" and i realized when we were leaving when he was like drive carefully, blah blah blah that it was like I was like the guy taking Gillian out on a date talking to her dad waiting for her. It made me laugh. and then we DIDN'T listen to music in the car, really... And I wanted to run into some people accidentally at town center, but we didn't, of course, luck never works out like that for me... Jersey Girl was actually good for a Ben Afflec movie. It was sad but it was funny too. It doesn't suck, I promise. I just remember walking back to the car after the movie laughing alot, I was probably being retarted, what else is new. And really that was the highlight of my weekend since i babysat Friday night.  Oh yeah I went to a night on the Oaktown before i went out with Gillian Saturday for about 30 minutes. I just got food because my parents had bought a ticket for me. THe food was actually pretty good, it was macaroni grill. I saw madame pisano and she was all her normal self, happy and crazy, and peppy, so i got that way too because i was just in a good mood, who knows why...

Before Today I didn't even think about this kind of stuff, before today I was so happy just being <STRONG>me</STRONG>, and just having time for <STRONG>myself</STRONG>. And I guess this wasn't just an earth shattering realization today, and that everything changed in one moment today in third period. I guess it was more of a gradual change, and i finally just realized it today. And I'm not saying I'm not happy anymore, I am, I'm really happy, and its true and genuine, but now theres something I want to add to it. Something that makes me laugh, and smile, I smiled today just thinking about everything, I smiled to myself. I can't remember the last time that happened. And I know this wouldn't be one of those things that after 2 weeks I'd be done, Its one of those things that makes me want to have a fun time, and be a better person. I just wish I had the courage to tell you exactly how I feel. I wish that maybe, you could tell me how you feel, and it would be what I want to hear. I have a feeling this is going to be harder then it should be, and I have a feeling I'm going to get hurt in the end. But above all I just want everything to work out great. Just this once, can everything work out for me.</P>

And then the read of the day was just so so. And then I went to Crew practice, and that was ok, normal again. Alot of running, but i didn't stop once. But then I gave this guy a ride home. He's a sophmore, his name is Jim. He's cool. We talked the whole way home, it wasn't all weird like sometimes it is when you don't really know the person. We talked about movies, and Carson, and all this other stuff. And he likes Italians, haha, and he said he wanted to meet my dad since he gives me alcohol. He doesnt do drugs, he drinks some. AND the best part, he watches the OC and doesnt miss an episode. AND he's a skiier and is tryign to get sponsered. It was a fun car ride. He told me my name was cute?? I guess thats good??

Justin invited me to go skiing again this weekend, we would have left thursday night and come home sunday night. But of course I couldn't go because of damn crew practice. So, instead of skiing I went to Crew practice Friday and Saturday. BUt on Saturday while we were out on the water it started POURING!!! not just a slight drizzle, it was raining cats and dogs (haha I've always wanted to say that). And the wind was blowing and we couldn't hear each other and we'll it was not pleasant rowing conditions. SO we decide to go back in and as soon as we get to the dock, and I'm not kidding, the sun came out. SO then we just turned right back aroudn and went back out on the water to continue rowing. But we were sokign wet and then you get moving pretty fast and it gets windy so i was so cold. So then I didn't wanna get my seat in my car all wet so i took off my sweatshirt and sweatpants and wore shorts and a tanktop home that were only semi-wet. OHHH it was an adventure. I could have jumped in the river and been less wet. 

I don't really feel like writing about the rest of my weekend in detail. Friday night I went out with traci, and today I bummed around the house and went and saw the Passion with my mom. It was really really graphic and kind of disturbing. I didn't cry, i almost get kinda teary at one part, but other people were crying really hard. I can totally understand why they were its really hard to watch, even if it wasn't Jesus it would be hard to watch. I'm glad I saw it, but I think its one of those movies I only want to see once."

I HATE HER!!! she makes me feel uncomfortable. so that was over late so i didnt get home till about 1140. Then I ate and just kinda hugn around the house until i went shopping with my parents, and then i needed to go to the mall to replace my sunglasses, and i ran into gillian and varun and aaron there and i made aaron uncomfrtable and it made me laugh, alot. hmm then i was late for regionals, but i didnt really matter, because i wasnt swimming anways, so i went and got THE WORST PARKING SPORT EVER! i had to walk a mile to get there, not really a mile but yeah i had to park in the golf course parkign lot. But then I got really happy there because I saw Steve from Langley and I haven't seen him in forever. And it was nice to see him. I had the biggest crush on him in 8th grade. haha and then at the swim meet he was like oh you drove i'll just get my alternate to swim for me and we can go out somewhere and i was like too bad i have no money and he was like ohhhh welllll *hint hint, i'll pay for you* but we didnt because we both knew it was all a joke, but it still would have been funny. THen i came home and there was this truck on fox mill road dumping water all over the road, and my car spazzed out and my steering wheel didnt do anything, but i was going 5mph so it couldn't have been hydroplaning, well it could have but 5mph, ah shit it was scary because i couldnt stear and i thought i was gonna shit something, so i managed to get it to go to a neighborhood to calm down and make sure my car was ok. A little bit of a spaz attack, but it wasnt my fault. I couldnt have done anything to prevent that, i was going slow enough, if i was going any slower i would have been stopped. So then I went over to Gillians, and we watched 13. GOOD MOVIE! kinda makes you think a little, and kinda makes you hate some people. But really really really good. definitely go rent it. And oh man i just realized its 12:22 and I didn't watch SNL and i missed weekend update and I'm sad now :( BUt it was a long day, but an ok day I guess, and tomrrow I have to study for AP History Test ALL day, and it's gonna suck and I'm dreading it. KILL ME NOW! </P>
<P>I made Lauren's lj all pretty and not ugly and boring. YAY! and it's exciting now. too bad i forgot how to do alot because i havent done it in forever, so it took me a little while to remember everything. I'm so proud of myself. GOD I'm such a lj whore.</P>"

I guess this is when the paranoid side of my personality comes out where I want to know whats happening and have everything planned out. YES, i do like to live in the moment, but i like to know atleast where im going, I mean i'm nto gonna plan out everyday of the rest of my life, I just wish I had some kind of track, some kind of idea of what I want, or where I'm going, and once I get there I can be spontaneous and live in the moment and party and have the college experience. 
I don't think I have ever been able to put some of those thoughts down, and it just feels better now that they are written down. 
Thanks for listening, if you actually got through that."

"event","<P>I'm so mad, so frusterated, I can't even put it into words. I know there are lies and deceptions going on, I can tell some people are thinking one thing and saying another. I want to not care, but I do. I wish every single girl on the planet would stop ditching their friends for guys and then try to explain later. I wish i wasn't the only one at oakton not coupling off. I really wish that I would just get back what i give. And I don't care what anyone says, when it comes to guys, girls will ditch other girls, because i've seen it happen way to many times. And I don't know how i'll handle it, but go out with him, really do it, im telling you too, just things will be different. Theres so much more going through my head, but I dont want to type it, because as pissed as I am right now I really don't want to get in a fight. I don't need drama, thats the last thing I need. ughhhhhh catherine maybe we need to have one of our talks and it will make me feel better, tomorrow districts :)</P>
<P>Tonight was the first night of districts, it was ok, it just lasted forever, and it was so hot I thought I was gonna pass out. But i did drive myself to school so i would have a car after school for districts and everything, that was fun except i froze my ass off walkign in from sutton.</P>
<P>HAHA oh man so today at districts Ben stole my cell phone and started calling everyone on my phonebook, and half the people called back and were like ""WHAAAT"" and then he called rachel who he lives next to who was driving his brother to check up on them. Isn't ben such a good brother. And through all this i decided again, i really need a guy. Because i got picked up and spun again by a guy. YAY, this is like twice in 2 days and 3 times in a week. Guys make my day, but then they make me want to feel loved.</P>
<P>I'm tired of putting up an act, I'm tired of not being able to open up, I'm sick and tired of not being able to be genuinly happy, Just for once i want to laugh without hesitation, smile without thoughts running through my head, and go out without being lonely, sad, or depressed.</P>"

"event","<P>Donnie Darko...hmmm... it makes me think of him.&nbsp; Not because we watched that movie like every night one summer, but because he is donnie darko. Because he has the capacity to love so much he would die so that you can live. Because people think he is crazy and messed up when he is smarter then anyone, and probably knows more then we ever will. Because he respects girls but still wants sex. He is my guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was the week from hell, sort of, i had 3 midterms and 2 other tests. But really i didnt study for any of them, so i think i failed the 2 midterms, i know i got an A on one, and one test i did good and the other who knows. I hate the last week of a quater, but it's ok because it's a 4 day weekend. </P>
<P>I had the SATs this morning at herndon. i love that school. I wish i went there. The people there are so different and so much more laid back then at oakton. I like the swim team better too. But i love my swim team...CATHERINE!!! YOU MAKE ME SMILE!! haha. but jeff is better then greg! oh but speaking of swimming last night i had a swim meet. Lori and Caitlin were there, 2 of my friends were there!&nbsp; I was so tired though because we had to wait at the pool for 2 freakin hours before we even got in the pool and the heat sucked all the energy outta me. But then at the end of the meet, this guy, who i swear is def one of the best freestylers and has no fat on his body, started hyperventilating and gettign sick and they had to call the paramedics and take him to the hospital. It was scary, but they said he was gonna be fine. But OMG we killed mt. vernon! we swept in so many events, even in the 500 free which is hard to do because its so long!! I lapped a girl like 3 times in it! It was amazing! But it was nice because they didnt give up and they kept swimming. And they didnt have a bad attitude. Districts are next weekend, its gonna be crazy. </P>
<P>i get my license monday. WOW. its gonna be insane, but it was so funny, last night lauren was like monday katie! and i was like what the fuck are you talking about what is monday! and then she just looks at me and i was like ohhhhhhh yeah my license. Atleast i think it was lauren i cant remember now. If it wasnt lauren and it was someone else who is reading this right now I am sorry. leave a comment to refresh my memory. Im just a little dumb.</P>
<P>I think Kerri is doing her brithday thing tomorrow. I have to go buy her a gift. Im so lazy. But I promise it will be good.</P>

"event","Oh God this weekend was amazing. It was the best weeekend in sooo long. I laughed soooo hard. WE had so much fun and there are so many funny stories. It would be such a long blog if i tried to type them all. Lets just say there were some funny falls, some with the ski patrol, and lots and lots of funny stories. Oh god i laugh just thinking about them. That trip made me so happy. I loved the 4 days break to not even think about school and have such a fun time. It was good to relax and take a little mini vaca.

There are new development with the car drama... I don't think I am going to get the dodge intrepid now, but don't fear, my parents have a back up plan THANK GOD!! My grandpa works at a car dealership in NY so hes lookin into cars up there for me and he has connections, my grandpa knows everyone, no joke. And then this weekend my dad was talkign about going to car max to look at cars. And we decided that i am gonna stick with automatic, just because traffic is so bad here. And me and my mom were talking about getting a honda cr-v because they are so cute and good cars and my mom likes those. But really I'll take almost anything. but yay, i am kidan excited about goign to shop for myyyyy car. haha."

<P>At first I thought this day was gonna suck because there was no snow but i was soooo wrong. So school was just so so but then I get hoem from the pasta dinner and my parents tell me that my aunt that lives in NY, not the one that is here that was gonna give me here celica, is getting a new car and is willing to give me her dodge intrepid. Yeah it isn't as&nbsp;cool as the celica, but shit dude its a really good car with barely any miles on it that i can get in 1 month!! Then I get a call from Justin asking if i could go skiing this weekend, but I was supposed to babysit for my cousin saturday night. SO i made some phone calls to my aunt and she said it was cool so my mom is gonna have my cousin come chill at our house and im gonna leave friday night around 830 after my swim meet to go skiing and stay till monday afternoon. And it's with all my friends from summer, like kevin, and brittany, and justin. Oh man it's gonna be fun. And justin's family owns a cabin and were gonna have the cabin up in PA and its like an actual ski resort and its all nice and shit and I'm so excited and they got alot of real snow there this week. AH YES! could this day be any better, a car really really soon from NY, which means I might get to NY to get it and drive it home :) and a ski trip. HOLY FUCKING SHIT ITS ABOUT TIME THINGS START GOING MY WAY!!!!</P>

NOT IF THEY HAVE A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND. I don't get how people can have the nerve to say i wish a guy felt that way abou tme when obviously they do and there are other people who try and just get hurt or ditched or used. So to all the people with couples, be happy and don't feel sad for yourself. period. I am done with my rant."

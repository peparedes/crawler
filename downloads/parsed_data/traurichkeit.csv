I love Christina to death and dont want to lose her...but if shit keeps going the way it is right now...its going to happen and im going to be the one hurting feelings.

On another note...besides all that bullshit...everything has been fine...hanging out with Bif and Aura (yes they are the only 2 friends I have near where I live...sad...isnt it).  Been hangin out at there house doing the reefer, playing video games listening to music, you know, shit you do when you go to Bifs house.

You<br>long to be able to reach out and tell someone<br>everything, and all of your problems... But you<br>have no one to tell, or they just don't seem to<br>want to hear what you have to say.

You've started to hide<br>and bottle up all or your problems and<br>feelings, hoping that maybe they just will go<br>away... You want company, but at the same time,<br>you're scared of it. Your sanctuary is your<br>room where you can just be alone and try to<br>throw away all of your aching pains. You're<br>dark and mysterious and people like you for<br>that reason. Even if you think you're all by<br>yourself in the dark, someone is always there<br>with you.

Korn has parted ways with guitarist Brian Head Welch, who has chosen the Lord Jesus Christ as his savior, and will be dedicating his musical pursuits to that end.  Korn respects Brian's wishes and hopes he finds the happiness he is searching for.  Jonathan, Fieldy, James and David are personally closer than ever, and are currently in the studio working on their 8th record, the follow up to their highly successful Greatest Hits Album.  The record is due to be released this coming September.

I am in shock...I dont even know what to think.  But they have been my fav band since I was in 4th grade...im going to respect Heads journey as much as the band does...

I feel really lonely right now too...some times I thing that there is no one out there for me...sometimes I do...but so far no one...I hope I find someone...I am lonely and dont want to be lonely anymore.  I just want someone to love and someone that will love me back...like Yoshi and Cwerky...they love each other...why cant I have what they have.  I guess it just wasnt ment for me.

Alone for the rest of eternity...

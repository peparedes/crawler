I'm all alone. now caitlyn has mike. mike likes caitlyn. i should just give up now. i have no one. it's ok. i guess. no one likes to be let down. i should just let it go. what the fuck am i babbling about. i should just shut up before i talk myself into a hole. that's it. i need alex to write back he's the kind of person i need to talk to right now. alright lates"

"event","hey whats up? well let me see. Sarah is a bitch all the time, and I can't really be like HEY LOOK YOU'RE BEING A BITCH, because she doesn't quite know she's being a bitch. I think it's just i wish she could always be the same friend she used to be back in 8th grade, but I'm pretty sure that wont happen. And i dont know if im jealous that she's friends with Jaime, but im sure as hell not happy about it. And i know it's totally unreasonable of me to even question who she's friends with but I do, and I honestly just can't help it. It must be jeaulousy, or maybe it's just fear that she'll stop hangning out with me and I'll have no one. OK enough worrying about that. I'll just have to wait and see what happens. Do i like Jason? Hm good quuestion, maybe I just want someone to be with. Even though i just stopped ""going out"" with ben. But I didn't even consider that anything because he lives in Mashpee. Yeah, i really don't know, I'm way to confused and/or lazy to think about it. Cigarettes? When the fuck did that become my annoying habit. I feel liek such a hypocrite for being a bitch to Sarah about it. But honestly i don't even care anymore. If i smoke cigarettes then oh well. I guess I do. I'm starting work at MacDougalls on saturday. Finally i can get some god damn money. School is ok. I'm really happy it's ending soon. It will be a huge relief. Well now that I've vented, I better go.

"event","wow, nothing special ever happens to me. Im worried about Emily. Not because i feel bad, or anything like that. She just means a lot to me, more than anyone probably understand, i know more than she does. And i know Shannon and Cassie aren't great friends to her, and i know she deserves more, but i couldn't say that to emily. it would crush her. I really hope i can find a way to get to her, she needs to stop hiding things from me. I know she's depressed.. why wont she just tell me. its not like I can't relate, because i can. I'm geniunely excited that tomorrow is Friday, maybe  I can make something out of this weekend rather than doing nothing like last weekend. But i did have a shit load of fun with Jaime and John at Uncle Larry's. I can't understand what is with me sometimes. Like sometimes I'm such a bitch for no reason, and sometimes I'm wicked nice. It's like why Can't i just be one thing, and stick to it. Maybe it's cause i try to hard to give people what they want, if someone asks me to yell at someone i will, i dont really think of what that person is feeling, That;s so shitty of me. You know what else surprises me among the billion other things. How weird Sarah is. She can be so much fun, and really sweet, and a great friend and thats what i love about her, But then she can be a complete bitch, and totally have no regard for anyone else except herself. Whats up with that. I have so much fucking shit on my mind right now, I really dont even want to think about it. ah maybe ill make a habit of actually writing in this once in a while, That would be good. Well later then."

"event","Tonight was science fair judging, surprisingly enough, it was actually fun. I talked to some people I never really get the chance to talk to, and it was nice. Different, but its unbleivable what cool people are out there and you never really get the chance to have a good conversation with them. And when you actually do, everything comes into a different perspective. I love it."

"event","Well I hate school more than anything. Ms. Lans today to me and Andrea was like, ""Well we moved Shannon because we feel that Shannon has more potential she isn't living up to in this talkative class with you girls"" I was like are you a joke? Then after school Mr. Giardi like flipped on me and started yelling at me cause I yelled at him cause he put a trick question on an already wicked hard test and I was like you and Ms. Lans make me want to kill myself, at the end of the day because of you i want to die. That school is ridiculous, the teachers think they're so perfect? FvCk that, they work at Falmouth Highschool, what does that make them. It just makes me so mad, i told my Dad i was like I am so going to Tabor next year, and if i dont get in I'll go to Mashpee Highschool anywhere but that school. I really hate it."

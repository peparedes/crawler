yeah yeah yeah. i am listening to the latest and most awesomest song by tim mcgraw... ""can't tell me nothin'"" awesome song! it hasnt been on the radio yet, but if u go to CMT.com you can listen to EVERY song that is on his unreleased cd. all of them sound good ;) its supposed to be his best cd, but i doubt it b/c in my oppinion... his last one is too hard to beat. o and hes going to be in a movie in october.. something about foot in lights? he plays a mean character. lol. i only know all this b/c my mom is like the biggest mcgraw fan in HC. so.. yeah. 

anyways, FOOTBALL GAME TOMORROW! w00t w00t. lol. im excited. i love football season. its the best. i got alott of HW to do before tomorrow though so im about to stop typing. OH! today... when i was at the store, i took a pic w/ my phone, and i went to 'my pictures' to check them out, and i found some REALLY ODD pics. its like a forest and stuff and then a car? weird. i think someone did it at CC but i was like whoa at 1st when i saw them cuz i had a dream i was walkin through the woods, and it was the 60's the other night... and the pic was black and white and it was in the woods... (in the 60's pics were black and white) and it was in the woods. so i was like whoa! lol but just now i saw a car that looks like katies so? mustve been at hart state park. i just put that together! smart.

well i guess i should probably ttyl. if anyone is goin to the HC game tomorrow call me... 436-7273. ttyl. - mike"

gah i am so sick of school. and i still have 11 7/8ths years of school left. or somewhere close to that! i decided on a new career path. i want to be a dentist. i think i would make a good dentist. lol. i would either be small town or big city dentist but idc. i think it would be so fun to fix peoples nasty teeth. so... whenever u get a cavity and ur older; look my practice up in the yellow pages. ;) 

but yeah... i asked this person who works at UGA how many years it will take to get all my dental and med school stuff and she said 8 years. so... i b like 26 or 27 b4 i even start! lol. o well. it will b worth it so much! yeah anyways, i dont really feel like typing right now, so i guess ill go do my HW. well im outta herre. ttyl"

but as far as that goes... i think im going to back off that this yr. i mean i need to get serious. i know im not a senior or anything but still, i need to really try to learn instead of watchign the clock tick in class. i have set new ambitions this yr. this might seem like a lame update, but its how i feel right now and this is my journal so im going to put that in here! 

back to normal... umm... i dont think i have much else to say except i did awesome at CC the last couple of days... really i am pulling through quite strongly. alott better than MS! in ms, i sucked! now im really good. i have gained alot of speed from track though, and endurace.. iono where i got that now. haha

oh well, i came in 6th place. not bad. i decided im not going to make this year a weak year for me like the last have been... i am going to set my mind to exceed my expectations... not mrs. rogers, or anyone else's but mine... and i hold high expectations! i dont see myself as being the fastest person on the team.. by any means, but i do see myself in the top 5. w00t w00t.

whats uppp, n2mh just listening to some musak. i am reallly blah today. im happy with a hint of blah. its just... boring. i woke up and wanted to go to anderson and no one will take me until tonight :(! so im not happy about that. oh well. BL00P! i love bl00p. its such a happy word to say when ur not happy. so is w00t. ugh.. i got this odd bump on my ear right now... i think its a mosquito bite :( i hate them dang thangs. i mean why cant they go get a life and go suck someone else's blood? like a snakes... a snake does not help me in any way! so why cant it just bite one of them? but n0o0o0 it has to bite innocent humans a spread diseases around like west nile :( 

oh well. i guess if i was a mosquito i'd bite everything i saw. well im not sure about that, but... almost everything. i'd bite trees! it wont hurt them! they are big and strong, and they have no emotions... see what boredom does to you? it makes you talk about what you would od if you was a mosquito! and it makes u write long/meaningless entries like this. 

well i got cross country @ 4:00 so im gonna go for now. its 3:06 and in hungary... austria hungary. i mean... hungry** my bad. i get them confused. talk ta u lateerrrrrr gators."

i had my first cross country practice of the season today and it was fun. we ran 2 miles though and i feel so slow compared to them fast big kids. lol. i said big kids... rright? yeah, well i am slow. i was pretty good in MS, but now... its like... whoa! 2 miles on the first practice... thats insane. im ms, we ran like 2 laps on the first practice! crayzeeness! 

i just read a thing about stalkers... i wish i had one! i think it'd be soo fun! lol. i mean... knowing someone is watching you all the time.. you could sit down at home and make funny faces and stuff to make the stalker think you're crazy... then you could dance, and sing... then the stalker would be like... whoaaaa! lol. 

yeah... just my thoughts though. well ima go

im happy as can be but im kind of bummed out about this... my mom is making me go to sleep at 11:30 this week b/c im used to staying up till 4:00+ and she wants to get me back on track for school. :( i dont like going to sleep early, so that is why i brainstormed and developed a faultless plan!... go to my room about 11, play playstation till 11:45 and then i make my move... i go out and do whatever i want b/c i can! 

geez though... a bed time! LAME! no one has a bedtime anymore! geez. i cant wait until school starts to get this mess over w/ b/c when school starts.. mike dont have a bed time! dumb though... i have one a week b4 school starts, but i dont have one when school starts. odd. 

ohh well, i dont care b/c im not living by that time anyways. so w/e. lol. ohh and if i went to sleep at 11, how could i go outside!? i go outside at like 1:00 or 2:00 and talk on the phone or walk around. i like it at night. its calm, the wind is perfect, the noise level is minimum, and its just so calm and relaxing. i love it. and... its quiet enough that you can think... i mean normally you try to think when people are talking, music is on, birds are chirping... at night, all u hear is crickets! and them mofo's dont bother me. so... 

i wish ashley would come home b/c i need to go to walmart and im not about to ask my mom or dad b/c i HATE going to walmart w/ them. they always have this gigantic list of stuff to get and they make me help them... 'mike, go get the laundry detergent, i'll get the cheese!' nO! whats the purpose of going if i cant go get what i want? okay. this is going no where. everything in this entry i mentioned is completely meaningless so if you read it all, give yourself a pat on the back. ;) well i am gonna go. peace out hommes."

im listening to the second best song ever composed; the eagles - lyin eyes. i lovvve it. the first best is 'tequila sunrise' by the eagles. they are now my favorite band. i know they are soo old and stuff, but you cant tell me the eagles suck. b/c they rock! i am so happy! i have no idea why... im just happy as can be! im happier than a little kid at the zoo...

anyways, im excited... cross country starts monday. im looking forward to that alott! i love CC! it rocks. i like running at cateechee the most b/c its fun once you get down that hill and you are by that bridge! i like it b/c theres a little house there... its like you come out of the woods and theres a little bridge and a house in the middle of no where... like the old evil womans house in 'hansel and gretel' i liked that story alott when i was little. it was the coolest.

i am really bored now though. i got to get up in 5hrs and 49 minutes and go to work... :(  but in a way thats the most awesomest thing ever! i need $$ bad! so... i finally got an opputunity to make some. i havnt worked in like 2 weeks. its been crayz. 

im really tired but i dont want to go to sleep. i feel like people are watching me when i sleep so i hate sleeping. when i sleep i always have wierd dreams that make no sense. i guess im weird. well... i am weird according to a few people. but thats okay!! i like being labelled as weird. its better than most labels. wait... what am i talking about? i dont care about labels. im just so sick of that! i no longer believe in labels! whoa... that sentence is too weird, therefor i cant not label myself weird as much as i dont want to. 

another thing i dont believe in... evolution. i do NOT believe in evolution at all! i hate it. i just got all thinking about stuff i believe in b/c this amish reality show commercial came on and made me think... they have different beliefs, what are mine!? so.. evolution. i dont believe in it. i mean some of it i do, but i dont think that monkeys changed to humans over time. its just too odd. i know that they are the most advanced creatures close to human kind but the thought of monkeys morphing into humans is highly unlikely in my oppinion. 

really, i could go on and on about my beliefs and its not like anyone reading this even cares, so i guess i'll stop that mess. its 12:30 and like i said, i gotta be up at 5:30 so im going to go watch some friends dvd's and watch my eyelids. im out scout."

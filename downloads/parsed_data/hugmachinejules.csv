"event","Okay, so I'm bored.  It's 12:30am.  I took one Ambien at 10, and another at 11, and I am still awake.  WHY AM I STILL AWAKE?  I'm sick.  I should get a good night's sleep.  GRAAAARGH.  I don't like it that my midnight friend, SAMANTHA picks this night to GO TO FUCKING SLEEP and I'm stuck here, awake, all alone, awake, with no one to talk to.  SAMANTHA...GRR.  I WILL GET YOU.  Why would she leave me so?  Ah!  I'm dying!  So this is what Sammi did, or lack of Sammi.  It made me write my first Livejournal entry.  Whoopee.  Am I supposed to feel some surge of joy?  Cause I'm not.  I actually feel, as I'm writing this, like that character in that movie and everyone leaves but he's still trying to finish his joke and he's telling the punch line to an epty room of NO PEOPLE and he's talking from a balcony and it was this fancy party but everyone left and he's still there, trying to finish the punch line of his joke...  That's how I feel.  I'm calling to an empty room, but no one is listening because no one is there except the janitor because everyone else is fucking ASLEEP.  GAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! I'm reading the stoned writing of a friend of mine right now...she's the only one who is awake right now besides me.  SAMANTHA SHOULD BE, TOO.  GAH!!!!!!!!!!  I want to sleeeeeeep but the Ambien didn't fucking work and so instead of getting the full eight hours of sleep I planned, I'll get about five, goddammit!  Yeah, I
m a bit annoyed right now.  Just a bit."

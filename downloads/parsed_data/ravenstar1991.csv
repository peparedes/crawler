My step mom Betsey went in for a triple bipass surgery today at 7:30 so things around here are a little crazy. 

Keep her and my dad in your thoughts and prayers please. This was very sudden and extreamly unexpected. 

I'll keep everyone updated on how things are going when i find out more information.

"event","People irritate me!  It's Sunday and my only day off this week. So I decide that I'm going to get up early and start my laundry. Considering that between the other 2 tenants in my fucking building the washer and dryer have been tied up EVERY DAY this week. So I start my shit in the laundry. At about 1:30 I lay down thinking that I could use a bit of a power nap. I wake up at 3 to hear that the dryer is still going..... hmm. So I meander down stairs to see that someone has eusurped the washer and dryer and my shit is no longer in them. AHHHHHH. At least they folded the stuff instead of just throwing it around... but REGUARDLESS! I had it first damn it. I have like 10 loads of laundry that I have to do to and I only get one day off to do it. I'm so talking to my landlord about this shit. We are supposed to have one day a week that we do our laundry... not 5 or 6 OR 7. and to top this all off the water and electric that are used for the laundry are on my fucking bill. AH. I never thought i would get this pissed off about fucking laundry. Inconsiderate people really piss me the hell off."

"event","Well we just wanted to let you all know that we finally got our Children's Miracle Network bracelets.  We only got the tye dyed ones for now.

I am hoping you all would support us in raising money for a wonderful Charity.  If it wasn't for CMN, our miracle Bekka would not be with us today.

We are selling the bracelets for $1.00 or more for donation per bracelet.  All the proceeds stay right here in Erie, for Saint Vincent's.  They provide life saving medical equipment for all the babies & children that are born sick or become sick.

Please email me or Bryan and let us know, if you would like to help us support such a wonderful Charity.  Again, because of them, they were able to keep her alive after the wonderful nurses at St. V's brought her back to life.  

Thanks Vicki.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~***************************~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That is from basicly my sister inlaw and she is talking about my 1 year old neice Bekka. I'm gonna help her with this and post on here.

Anyone who wants to buy one of these bracelets let me know and I'll personally deliver it for you. like she said the bracelets are 1.00 a peice but any donation can help. This organization has done wonderful things for her daughter and other children across the country. 

Please share some holiday spirit and donate for a good cause. I'll collect and deliver to anyone who wants to buy them. For yourself, a loved one, a friend or even just because.... every little bit helps. 

Leave me a comment on here if you would like to help out.

"event","Well i see that it's been quite some time since i have updated this and i figure that it's about time as I have much to talk about and i want to let people know that i'm still alive. 

I'm about 4 weeks intot the semester and thus far I have a 4.0 which is great for me and is the first time that I have really excelled in all my classes. I love my schedule this term, all of my classes are great. I have Arson Investigation, Juvenile justice, Shakespear, and Intro to Moral issues. The only class that is a little tough is Moral Issues because it's a saturday class from 9-12. But I'm doing good in school and should graduate May of 08. 

John and I are doing swimmingly. I'm happy with him and he makes me smile, not to mention that he pushes me to do the best that i can in everything that i do. He makes sure that I study every night and helps me when he can. 

I'm working 2 jobs at the moment, I'm back at West and still at Ollie's. Both jobs are going great and the income is awsome. Because of this boost in pay, i'm going to be able to get my own apartment next month and should be moved in by Nov 1st. This is an exciting thing for me because I will finally be on my own and that's a great accomplishment for me. I am finally totally out of debt and have started working on rebuilding my credit that i so neglegently distroyed over the last 4 years. But it's getting better. 

Life in general is great and I'm in a good place in most of my life. I have even regained contact with my mother who i haven't talked to in almost 10 years. It's a little weird but she too has changed and we are slowly working on rebuilding our relationship. This is a huge step in my healing process because so much of the pain, anger and hurt that i have built up over the years stems from my interactions of lack there of from my mom. 

The only sad thing in my life right now is my father. His condition is worsining every day and he has been put on oxygen to help him breath. It kills me to see my dad like that knowing that there is nothing that I can do to make it better. He trys hes best to make me feel like i'm helping but i know in my heart and in my head that I am going to loose my father sooner then I want to admit. Thinking about it makes me sad. I want my dad to be at my wedding, to see his grandchildren, and while he may get one of those, I know the other may be out of reach. I can only pray that I will get the time and that it will work out in the end. Pray for him for me please.... or if you don't pray, keep him in your thoughts. 

Outside of this life is good as i said. I hope that all of you are doing well and that life is treating you well. I will try and update more often. 

Hugs to everyone.

"event","I know not exactly a normal title for a journal post,but relivant none the less.

I have become very aware of just how some people are unable to forgive and forget. No i'm not refering to any of my friends, this on is for family. I'm in a situation where i'm happy with the person I'm with and my parents are trying to sabotage my relationship (again). It's really annoying. 

On another note. I have a head ache.... karens Birthday... bar hopping.. etc... you get the picture, it's self inflicted. :)

My friend Frank is doing a whole lot better! I went to see him in the hospital wednesday ( i got him a really cute frog to keep him company.... we named it crash :)) Hes much more responsive then he was before and that makes me happy. Its good to see that his spirits are up, even though he knows he was an idiot and that he's gonna get beat when he's better. But that's good news.

To relate to Molly... I know what you are going through with your records search darlin, I have a younger sister out there somewhere that I haven't seen in the better part of 20 years. I have been trying to locate her but because my dad gave up his parental rights i'm not able to access any of her records or anything. Kinda depressing. 

Other then that things are going well, I'm getting ready to adjust my class schedule again this term, I'm dropping a course because i have way to much on my plate. 

Hope that everyone is doing well and that you are all enjoying life :)

My first day of school was monday and everything went well.... except for the fact that i found out that one of my close friends from school was in a very serious car accident sunday morning. He's pretty beat up. broken arm and leg, over 400 stiches, 3 fractured vertibrae, a bruised spleen, major head trauma, and other problems as well. I have spent a lot of time over the past few days at hamot in thier ICU department spending time with him. Never before have i been so scared, i have lost a few friends in accidents and came too close to loosing another one. Anyone who has been in a bad accident or knows someone who has knows what kinda stress it causes. Pray for him for me.

"event","Another Birthday come and gone. I had a blast last night hanging out with my sister who also gave me some really good advice about this whole situation. 

I have come to realize that someone out there is unwilling to let the past die, I don't know who it may be, but none the less they are unwilling. It's funny how one person with cruel intentions can throw a group of people into a tail spin. I have also come to the conclusion that some things are better left to die. I know it is a horrible way to put things, but alas, that's basicly what it is. I'm not going to jepordize anymore of my friendships over this. So from this point out that aspect of my past and my future is dead. It hurts me to no end to say that.... but as you will it so shall it be. So goodbye, and best of luck to you.... may the sun always warm your face and the wind be always at your back. 

To the rest of my friends. From this point on, my journal too shall be friends only so if you would like to add as a friend, the do it soon, because i'm changing it over by the end of today. My friends are still my friends, none of you are included in this, and no one else should be involved. I will still hang out and chill and everything else, and yes things will get better and yes things will start to heal, and yes someday soon I will be alright. :) I am not afraid anymore. I have come to the conclusion that life is too short and that i can't spend my life doing this. So as i said before I'm done.... today starts a new day.... the first day of the rest of my life........ and man o man, is it gonna be a hell of a ride. 


Hugs to all.

He walks you say sit down it's just a talk 
He smiles politely back at you 
You stare politely right on through 
Some sort of window to your right 
As he goes left and you stay right 
Between the lines of fear and blame 
And you begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

Let him know that you know best 
Cause after all you do know best 
Try to slip past his defense 
Without granting innocence 
Lay down a list of what is wrong 
The things you've told him all along 
And pray to God he hears you 
And pray to God he hears you 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness 
And I would have stayed up with you all night 
Had I known how to save a life 

As he begins to raise his voice 
You lower yours and grant him one last choice 
Drive until you lose the road 
Or break with the ones you've followed 
He will do one of two things 
He will admit to everything 
Or he'll say he's just not the same 
And you'll begin to wonder why you came 

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend 
Somewhere along in the bitterness

School has 2 weeks left to try and kill me and trust me it is coming close. I have two projects due on monday that i haven't even started to work on yet. Bleh. I'm pretty sure that i'm screwed next semester because the state only gave me 500 dollars in financial aid. :) Dad said he's gonna try for a plus loan and while his attempt is worthy of praise, i know he won't get it. SOOOOO.... here i come to take out another unsub loan to throw into my pile and drownd myself in school debt a little more. 

Right now i'm looking at the clock going ""it's quarter after 10 and i need to start getting ready for school"" Meh, not really worried about it as long as i'm outta here by 10:30 I'm golden. :) 

So what does everyone have planned for the summer? anything interesting?

Anyways I know that it has been a long time since i updated last but i have been a busy girl. I'm working at Ollie's (Grand Opening May 3) and getting ready for finals. Not to mention that i'm also working my ass off with Drum Corps. There is just so much to talk about but not nearly enough time. 

Last night I went to see train with Mike, Chad Monica Christopher and Molly. And I can honestly say that it is the LAST time i will see them in concert. My taste in music is much heavier then them and frankly i'm sick of hearing the same songs over and over again. Sorry Mike and Chad, I just really didn't like the show. I thought their stage presence was horrible (not to mention having to wait for almost 40 minutes between the Comedy Replacement Opening Act and Train to start. Which i guess kinda boggles my mind see as how there wasn't exactly anything that needed to be torn down or set up. It was just to long of a wait. 

Okay.

That's over. 

Other then that Life is good, i have a trip to Rodchester with the Thunderbirds next weekend, and the most exciting thing that i'm realllllyyyy looking forward to is::::

On June 2,3 and 4 I will be in Boston for the STAIND show..  WOOOTTTT!!!! Can you tell i'm excited? My friend Karen and I are driving over for the show becuase we wanna go on a road trip. :)

"event","Well it's time for another update. 


Today is monday, and quote my last entry on my feelings about monday.

This week promises to be exciting. I should be getting my refund check from my taxes this week. I also start working at my new job on tuesday and for the rest of the week. My schedule is nice 8:30-4:30 on tuesday and thursday and 5-9 on wednesday and friday. So it will be nice. It should make the week go fast because we are steel setting (setting the shelving in the store) and then after the steel set is done, we have to stock the store, all in all its going to be a good time, the staff and the management team are great and i'm working with a few people that i know. 

Then the thing i'm looking forward to the most is my trip to harrisburg with the thunderbirds. We are leaving saturday at 9 am and will be back some time on sunday afternoon. I can't wait it will be a great trip and we are going to sound awsome. 

Other then that i'm just working, going to school and sleeping, there is some studying in there somewhere as well. But i hope the week goes by quick. 

Hope everyone else has a great time.

"event","So today is Monday... oh how I Lothe mondays. They are simply the worst day of the week..... cause from monday, friday saturday and sunday all seem so far away. 

I'm imbarking on an exciting journey this week. I get to write a letter to the dean of EUP telling him why i want to declare a second major in forensic chem. Then from that point the substance of the future of my education lies in his hands.... scary huh. With a simple flick of a pen he can simply tell me no and give no reason other then ""Because I said so"". This response will determine the path of the rest of my educational goals, because w/o the second major I become ineligible for my Masters Degree, because most of the grad schools require a BA or BS in Science to enter into their programs. That would crush me. I know that i have set some really high goals this last term, with wanting to make deans list, and starting to think about persuing a second degree as well as masters school. I know that when all is said and done I will be in school till 2010 or 2011. It seems like a long time but in fact it is small patatos compared to my ultimate goal which is to work in a federal CSI lab as an expert forensic scientist. I have a lot of support from both my family and my friends, everyone seems to want me to succeed... but i have my doubts. It's all riding on this response to the declaration of the BS in Forensic Chem. 

Anyways. This weekend was fairly uneventful, friday i worked then went home and to bed... saturday mike and I bummed around the house most of the day watched a movie, then i went out with some friends for a little bit, sunday i worked (until the mainframe crashed and they had to close down my line group) then i went up and hung out w/ debbie and brayden for a little bit, deb and I went to rack n roll for a drink then i went home and crashed.

The Dr has me taking muscle relaxers for my headaches now, and let me tell you i have gotten the best 3 nights sleep i have had in like 6 months because of these damn things. they are like gold. I take on I lay down and w/i 20 min I'm out and i sleep the whole night, I don't wake up tossing and turning, i feel rested and refreshed when i get up. It's nice.

Other then that life procedes as normal, exciting at some moments and dull at others. I can't wait to start my new job, i'm looking forward to the end of the semester, summer will be exciting. 

Good day to all.

"event","Alright well i realize that it's been about a month since i updated my journal. And well i have some time to kill so i guess i can update. Right now i don't like life. I'm not a happy person lately. I have been meditating recently and well i have found that my focus is gone. I don't know what i'm doing anymore and it's frustrating. I'm trying so hard to be everything that everyone wants me to be but in the process i'm forgetting who i really am. That makes me sad, and angry. I wish i could just do what i want to do and not have anyone give me shit about it. ARGH. I'm sorry this is such an angry post but i feel like flipping out and well this seems like the place to do it. I'm tired all the time, i'm always eating wrong, if i eat at all i feel like i spend my life either sleeping, studying, going to school or going to work. the only bit of respit i get from this aggravating lifestyle is the few times i go out to concerts. And whats worse is that it's having effects on other things outside of school. Mike and i never see each other. Never. Other then sleeping and this is bad. 

I know that i have a responsibility to school and work and family and mike and my friends.... but damn it i can only be pulled in so many directions before i snap and ladies and gentlemen, i have snapped. Figuritivly of course. I have finally reached the breaking point where i am two steps from saying fuck everyone i'm in this life for Number 1 me. I know it seems harsh, but damn i just can't keep pleasing everyone with out getting something out of it. 

This is the first part of the private entry i posted right before this. I'm not posting that cause i don't want to hurt anyones feelings. 

Life is crazy. I'm tired. Ready to quit.... but I just gotta keep on keeping on. 

Peace.

"event","Well this has been an uneventful weekend. 

Kinda

So friday night i worked... till after midnight. Bleh.

I went home, slept and woke up to go to work saturday morning at like 9... they suspended me at 12 for not asking a customer if there was anything else i could help them with. Bullshit all around. 

So i went home, then mike came home. We then proceded to find SOMETHING to do. We called clay... he had a show.. we called paul and suzie, they were both working. Sooooo then we decided that we were going to go out and go shopping with Chad and Monica. We went to sams club, petsmart, and walmart... then we had taco bell for dinner ( i am convinced that tacobell puts LSD in their taco meat.) After that we went for a drive around the dock (i didn't know they had torn down the waterfront... that depressed me a little bit.) after that we went for a drive to the pennisula... exciting. After that we went home. I went up stairs and meditated and mike sat and watched TV. Like i said exciting. 

Now here is the reason i think taco bell puts LSD in thier tacos.

I couldn't sleep, i kept hearing noises and seeing things and stuff. When i finally fell asleep at like 4:30 I had a horrible nightmare that one of my friends was hurt, when i woke up, i looked at the wall and i saw blood running down the wall.... I FREAKED! Mike woke up and he had a dream about me getting eaten by some green blob. Interesting.... but here is where it gets weird.

When i was online yesterday I was talking to my friend Travis... my good friend travis, and i found out that he was in the hospital at 4:30 or 5 in the morning because his lung partially collapsed. Not cool at all. It made me kinda weirded out because of the dream i had. So now i'm worried about him and his health. Grrr. 

Well that was my productive weekend. 

Exciting huh?"

Any takers.... we can get all bundled up grab some cheep sleds from wal-mart and hit frontier park..... it would be fun to go out and act like we are all 10 years old again. Afterwards we can retire to some local establishment and have drinks, or hot coco. I know i'm a dork.... but it would be interesting. 


On another note. I have decided to drop my psych class because(8854984<--Thank you Captain Kidd) the work load is to much for me. I'm taking a lot of classes that require a lot of reading and book work and i just don't have time to study for it. I don't want it to hurt my GPA. 

See the numbers my Cadre Member(ROTC Teacher) decided to invade my journal. 

Other then that i'm looking to have a good time this weekend. Mike has saturday off and i'm just kinda looking at studying that day and getting ready for the exam that i have in government. 

I hope everyone has a good weekend.

"event","So... NO SHIT THERE I WAS

driving to edinboro on 99 when this asshole breakchecked me....

before you ask, no i didn't slide into him. 

But upon hitting my breaks there was a flood of light from my dashboard.

THE.....
Check engine
Change oil Soon
Check Oil pressure
Check Trans Fluid
AND 
Check Power Steering Fluid lights

All came on at once.

This made me think.... ""Hmm hey it's been about 6500 miles since my last systems check""

So i immediatly took my car to wal-mart.

They checked the oil, and he says to me....
""you are damn lucky your car is still running""

OK then... Kelly needs to pay more attention to her car.

*Headdesk*

Other then the oil, i needed a new air filter, and oil filter... the trans, and ps fluids were both fine the sensors just went screwy from the other lights. 

Needless to say 30 dollars later, my car is better. Runs better, isn't jittery, and isn't making that annoying ticking sound anymore. 

YEAH!!!

I'm done for now, i'm sure there will be more exciting stories from my life...... soon.... until then.

Hugs to all.

""i'm not supposed to be scared of anything but i don't know where i am, I wish that i could move but i'm exausted and nobody understands. I'm trying hard to breath now but there's no air in my lungs there no one here to talk to and this pain inside is making me numb. I try to hold on from loosing control no one can help me cause no one knows....""

I don't know why the words from that song hit me so hard, but they did. I find in kinda strange. Maybe it just a general preception. I have never been one to admit my fears ""i'm not supposed to be afraid of anything."" I think i'm in a place in my life where there are a lot of things that are happening that are terrifing me. The situation with my dad being the main one. It kinda feels like i'm lost. But i'm pretty sure that is what is making the connection. 

In other news. I'm feeling better today... the swelling in my face is almost totally gone :) and i'm not black and blue anymore. Life is getting back to normal, or however close to normal i can get. 

I have to get to class.

"event","well i have been on my diet for one week. 

My starting weight was 220 and as of 9pm last night i'm down to 202. Not bad for one week. My dietrician says that it is very normal for someone to loose up to 20 lbs their first week because of the water weight. I'm happy, i feel good. I feel like i'm doing something good for my self. My weight goal is 150. I think i can do it. I wanna be there by september. I will be there by september, i'm gonna go back to school next year and TURN HEADS. :) Not that i don't already :) My claim to fame, a dr's visit with a Blood Pressure of 176/94 WAY TO HIGH, decided it was time for a change. Well ladies and gents changing time is here. And the only person that is pushing me is me. I'm doing this because heart problems, lung problems, and diabeties run in my family and i don't want to be 25 and having a heart attack. That would not be cool at all. Change while your young, while you can. Nothing was stopping me but me. I have my goal and i WILL get there by september (come hell or high water and i see them both in the distance.)

Another thing that is motovating me is the bet i have going with a few of my ROTC cadre members. That if i can meet and exceed weight and PT scores (2 mi in 21 min, 75 sit ups in 2 min, and 25 pushups in 2 min) by the begining of the next term..... they all have to wear kilts around the Batallion for a week. They are still planning my fate if i don't make it. But i will so it's all good. I think it will be funny to see some of these big strong army men reduced to kilts. Yes.... funny. 

Out side of that, i have a lot of studying to do... i have a quizy in my PA crime codes class on monday that i have to get to work on, and i have a chapter in my government book to read and outline. :) and 6 hours before work. and I still have to get a work out in. 

So off to my busy day I go. I will keep all of you up to date on my progress and this will probably be my normal sunday post. I'm excited and I know i can do it. It may sound like 220 to 150 is a hell of a drop, but i'm doing it for me. And I'm doing it right and I have 35 weeks to get it done.

i'm at school... my face is looking a little better, i still look like i have been going rounds w/ muhamad ali, but other then that i'm alright. I'm still a little sore, but it's getting better. I am very much looking forward tomarrow, our wine party is going to be a needed respite from this hellish week. I know that we are going to have a great time. :) we are all gonna get a little tipsey and watch chick flicks.

Other then that i would like to thank MOLLY for the beautiful floral arangement she sent me. It is great and looks very pretty on my mantal. It was very sweet of you to send that to me. So thank you. 

School seems to be going well and most of my professors have been really receptive about me missing class because of my mouth. I know it was really bad timing both here and at work. 

Work is shitty, i don't like my job, especially because they conviently lost my dr's excuse to cover the days i have missed. So now there is a possibility that i might loose my job unless i can get a dr's excuse to cover the days i have missed. So that is what i'm doing today after i get outta class. I'm gonna go and sell my Psych book back because i am getting a free one from the company and for 112 dollars i'm just going to take advantage of the free black and white text. 

well that is it for now i'm looking forward to seeing you all tomarrow for our little party it will be nice to hang out and spend time together. I hope everyone has a great day and enjoys their friday.

As for the title of my entry. 

Yesterday whilst lying on the couch after the surgery and i was hurting something feirce. Michael leaves to run to the hardware store(I got a little upset because he left me alone, and when i'm sick i think the world revolves around me.) and i was just kinda vegging out being grumpy and he came home with a cute little teddy bear and a get well card for me. He is such a sweet heart. ** Trys to smile, but fails miserably**

I was at my grandmother house... keep in mind that i stop there randomly w/o warning and no one usually knows that i am there. Today i stopped one because i had to pee and two because i needed to wrap a shower present for my friend Jenn. So there i am sitting at my grams house and her phone rings..... it's for me. My first thought was Mike... boy was I wrong about 6198.0 miles wrong.  Low and behold my close friend Kevin called from Iraq to talk to me... random. 

What are the chances that he would call a number that i haven't lived at in almost 3 years to talk to me and i would be there.... like i said this had to be fate, even HE doesn't have that kind of timeing.... think about it over 6 thousand miles and 8 hours time wise differece... it was 4ish here when he called which would have made it almost midnight there. Wow. I'm floored. 

I just thought i would write that in here for those who may not have such a strong belief in fate as I.... now you see why i do...

"event","well another semester has started and low and behold i have a 40 minute period open to come in and update my journal. 

I had my first batch of classes today and so far the all seem pretty cool. I know for a fact that i am going to hate government because he's already being an ass.... just like before, unfortunitly i don't have the option not to take the course because it is required for graduation. Out side of that i know most of my classes are going to be interesting. My Rotc class is going to be loads of fun because we have the same crew in it that we did last term and we get along great. I really am thankful to be in the ROTC program here, i have met a lot of really great people and the instructors and fantastic. 

Outside of school, life is truddging along slowly. The last few days have been rather painful, and i will explain why in a second. I went to the emergency room last night because i was in a lot of pain. The gave me a perscription for vikiden and i'm a little worried about taking it with my classes. 

So heres the story about the pain.... I went to the dentist about 4 months ago. While there they did complete x-rays and told me that everything looked fine and that the two top wisdom teeth that are impacted shouldn't cause me any trouble, but low and behold now i have one of them starting to come in and it is causing a lot of pain. I can't open my mouth all the way, chewing food is more then a chore. and it is annoying, and on top of all of that, it became infected (thus the trip to the emergency room last night.) 

Mike is mad cause i haven't called the dentist yet. I will call him when i am done here and tell him to call and make me an appointment ASAP. Lucky for me i still have my fathers insurance which should cover a fairly decent chunk of the bill. I have a feeling that i will have to have them pulled out because of the way they are growing in. OH WELL. 

Out side of that. Mike and I found out the other day (after i spent the better part of 4 hours on the porch with a heat gun, stripping the paint) that our house is littered in lead. The paint on all the doorways and the entire front porch is lead based.... this caused quite a scare because i have been really exposed to the toxins over the last few weeks. I have to contact the state about getting a lead poising test done so i can find out if everything is ok. 

Other then that everything is going well I know i have to return 3 books and buy 6 more.... but eh, all in a days work. 

I'm done for now, i have to get to class. I will talk to you later..

"event","isn't it funny how sometimes our lives seem to come full circle.

I realized this on new years eve. 
lemme give a little background.

When i moved into milcreek in 97 i had no friends... none. I was outta the city and hated milcreek with a passion. There was a kid who lived behind me named Bryan that after about 3 weeks of living where i was i became very close friends with... about a year later his best friend Mike started coming around and he was added to the little circle. There were others involved to Matt and Nichole and Jess. i met the boys the summer of my 7th grade year, they were both juniors at McDowell, but the age difference never posed a problem... we were all very close and i was always the youngin'. I entered high school and the boys went of to college, although we were quite a few miles apart whenever they were home they would come and see me and we would hang out. i always knew i had them there if i needed them, bryan became my brother... he watched out for me. But then something happened, and our happy little group wasn't so happy anymore...we seperated even bryan and i stopped talking... it went about 2 years we would see each other now and again but it wasn't the same. During this time both bryan and mike got married; bryan had a baby and i started college. I made it a point to get back up with bryan and his wife vicky and over the last year or so we have once again become very close. But bryan and mike still were not speaking, and i hadn't heard from mike in a long time. mike started to work at lowes, we had talked a few times but nothing big... then we started hanging out more and more and started becoming close like we had been in the past. Mikes wife and i plotted to get bryan and mike in the same room so they could figure their differences and it worked... then they started talking again.

where am i going with this.....

new years eve there we all sat Bryan Mike Me, Nichole, Matt, Vicky Jess in the same room joking and laughing as in years past and i realized that we had come full circle the three of us and our families. I am gratefull for that, i cherish my friends and love it when we are all together and its peaceful. 

Some things change, many others stay the same... i guess it just goes to show you that the strongest friendships can survive anything. Bryan Mike and I are back to being very close..... and i am still the youngin'.

"event","alright well i had a wonderful christmas with both my family and mikes.... I love christmas it's the one holiday a year that my family has to be nice to each other. And gram made dinner so you know it was good. I got some really cool stuff, mike got me this really kick ass elements incence and candle set for my alter (for those who may not know i'm Pagan.) and his parents and brother got me a palm pilot. Actually they got me a gift card to walmart that i bought the PP with. Mike and i have spent the last few days trying to figure out how to link it to the computer so that i can get all the information i need into it, but so far no success.

In other news, on christmas eve my best friend Chrissy got married in the chapel at St. V's hospital. it was a sweet little ceremony and i got to be her maid of honor..... we managed to throw the wedding together in less then 3 weeks. (I'm proud.)

Only problem i had this christmas was with a gift i got my father.

I got him a gift card for Bob's Gun Shop in McKane, it's an indoor shooting range, and this is something that he had at one time said that he wanted.... but now because of his illness he can't use it. I went back to bob's and explained the situation, but he wouldn't give me my money back... so now i'm stuck with a 50 dollar gift card that i will never use, so i put this out..... If anyone is interested in a 50 dollar gift card to bob's, I am selling it for 40 dollars. Just let me know. 

Well i guess i'm gonna go i have some stuff that i have to do around the house here. Hope everyone enjoys the holidays...."

"event","Alright, well here i am 2:30 in the morning and i'm awake. This in fact has been quite normal for me.... tonight i actually have shit to talk/vent about and well it's a whole lot easier on here then on anything else. For those of you who may not know my dad has been diagnosed with a terminal illness that is slowly attacking his lungs. It will eventually kill him, there is no cure and there is no treatment. This has been on of the hardest few months of my entire life, At first i hid it and now i'm slowly starting to let it out... but i'm not to the point of talking about it just yet... for now i just blog and get it off my mind so i don't explode. 

Let me give you some background about my dad and I.

My mom left when i was like 2 so it's been me and him for a very long time. My dad has been my backbone. He has supported my decisions, helped mold my character, he has been there through the boyfriends and the bullshit, the times that i lost things and some of the proudest moments of my life so far. He is my inspiration and at times my diciplinarian. He is the sole reason I am where I am today and why I have chosen the path that I am on. A military man who served his country in the Marine Corps, and served his community as a police officer for almost 20 years. Many people don't know but I almost lost my father when i was 5. He was injured in a riot downtown and was in a coma for almost 2 months, doctors still say that was a miracle. He is strong and proud, he doesn't like to admit defeat... this i have learned the hard way over many teenage fights. He has given the clothes off his back to keep food on the table for our family. We have suffered through living in the ghetto, to our lives now. 

Your are probably wondering why i'm telling you this and to be honest i really don't know. I imagine that i want people to see how much he really means to me and maybe it will help people understand why this is so hard on me. 

I hate the fact that he is sick and that i have to stand by and watch him die. And that is the hardest part. There is no cure, no treatment, only prolonging the fucking inevitable. And i HATE that. I just want to make it better. I want to make everything go away like he has done for me every time i have been sick. But i can't and it's driving me crazy. And on top of it all i can't talk to him about it. I have NEVER not been able to talk to my dad about stuff and for some ungodly reason i can't talk to him about this. I don't wanna hear it and i don't want to discuss it. Mostly because I don't want to believe it. And the worst of it is, that there is no telling how long we have left. This disease is so unpredictable..... so random that he could get a flare up and be gone tomarrow.... and that is the scarest thing of all. 

I have always pictured my dad at my graduation for school, giving me away at my wedding, holding my first born child. I have pictured him being old and grey telling my children stories about me when i was young and I don't want to thing about that not happening. It hurts so bad that just thinking about it makes me cry and i hate that too. 

it seems i hate a lot of things right now. 

When i first found out about this, i stopped going over to see him. He called me on it about 4 days ago. Telling me that my stepmother (who has only been around a year) and my grandmother were ready to shoot me. He acted like i did it on purpose when the fact is that i'm just scared i'm truely in denial and i don't know how to express that to him so i hide from it. I tuck it away until eventually it comes out in a big long ranting blog. Although, i do feel quite a bit better now that i have gotten this off my mind. Not to mention the sleeping pills are starting to kick in. 

I guess what it all boils down to is fear.... my biggest deepest fear is being realized. My dad is my world, and the thought of loosing him terrifies me. The only way to get over fear is to face it though......just figuring out how to face it is my biggest obsticle. 

I appreciate the kind words from friends and I know when i need you, you will all be there for me. Right now i'm not ready to talk about this, i'm not quite ready to accept it..... when i do, you will be the first to know."

I Hate fake people. You know the ones, the ones who can't fucking make up their minds on who they are or what they like. The ones who act like they are someone else to impress people or make people like them.... or in the worst case to get attention. This behavior pisses me off in ways unimaginable especially when i'm around it. I don't like fake people and usually i can pick them out of a crowd.... I'm usually not one to say anything but I'm so sick of this preticular phenominon that it's just making me sick. I love people who are so comfortable with them selves that they can be what ever they want and it's okay because that is who they are. It has taken me a long time to become that way... to be so comfortable with me that i just don't care what people say..... But it seems as though this way of being is slowly dissapearing and today more then ever everyone is trying to be someone else. Trying to talk act dress, listen to the same music... but it's not who they really are in in actuallity they are simply trying to get attention or make themselves look better. Argh.

END RANT: 

Alright Now that that is out of my system. I'm finally done with school my final with a preticuar professor who will remain nameless was today...  so if anyone who cares wants to hang out.... get a hold of me between now and january 18 because after that, you will never see me due to the 19 credit term i have coming up....

And the exam today is on totally different material then the final will be on. I hate this man... have I mentioned that. I wish thee university would get rid of him, but he's tenyeard so they can't even though the entire department wants him gone. Argh.

"event","hey i know it's been a while that since i last updated my journal, so i imagine its about time.

thanksgiving went well, i got to see my family and eat good food. I love it. Other then that school school school. I'm almost done, i have 3 weeks left and trust me when i tell you that i can't wait till i'm done. 

Other then that. 

I have my schedule ready for next semester techically i only have 18 credits, but i'm taking 19 credits worth of classes. It's gonna be busy but not to bad. my mondays are 7-9:30 my tuesdays are 7-4:30 and my fridays are 7-1:50. So my week gets decressingly long. I love school.... i love school.. i love school, just gotta keep telling myself that, i'm almost done.

Other then that, I am working almost full time, most weeks, but i don't know if i'm going to have my job after the season is out. I think i'm going to get laid off at the end of the term. But it's alright i'll make it work somehow. I know i work 3-11 most m w & f, off t & tr, and S & Su i'm usually 12-8:30. So i'm pretty busy.

My brother had his baby, shes in the nicu right now, so pray for her if you get a sec. She's not tolorating food right now and there is a problem with her heart. Becca was born 12lbs 14 oz, big baby at 2 ft long. Deb is ready to have hers any day now, if she doesn't go into labor on sunday, then they will induce labor on monday or tuesday. Either way my nephew will be born in the next week. 

Other then that life is  peachy, i'm tired and cranky, but that comes with the territory. I know I have until the begining of next semster to be able to do 60 sit ups 20 pushups (in 2 min) and run 2 miles in 20 Min. So if anyone feels like working out w/ me feel free to give me a buzz. 

For now i need to go i'm going to be late to class if i piddle around here much longer.

In love, you feel the most alive when things are straight-forward, and you're told that you're loved.

You'd like to your lover to think you are stylish and alluring.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was emotional, moody, and difficult to please.

Your ideal relationship is lasting. You want a relationship that looks to the future... one you can grow with.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

on saturday i got to judge the mcdowell Drill competition. It was a lot of fun and all of the cadets did a fantastic job. 

also on saturday my sister in law Vicki had her 3rd baby girl. Becca. this baby was huge 12lbs 14oz and 26 inches long..... my family knows how to grow them. Mom is doing great after the C-section, and becca is in the NICU under mild observation for a bit of a breathing problem she was having at birth. The dr's said it is most likely because of her size and should get better with time. My brother once again is the proud pa pa calling everyone he knows bragging about his little girl. that's number 3 for bryan which brings my Neice count up to 5. Andrea and Courtney my sister mary's two, Bailey, Skyler, and Becca. My brother 3. And we are giving deb till friday before my only nephew will be born. So by the 1st if december, I will have 6 neices and nephews. TEE HEE... FUN!

Outside of that nothing real big going on here... just taking time to update cause i know i'm gonna be buried in the books today cause i have 2 exams during classes. 

and of course my day wouldn't be complete with out giving the awsome countdown o' the day

there is exactly...

2 days 11 hours and 57 min before the disturbed concert... it's so close i can taste it!

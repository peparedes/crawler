Well I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world will bear a consequence

"event","I'm Glad You're In My Dash 

I read of a man who stood to speak
at the funeral of a friend. 
He referred to the dates on her tombstone,
from the beginning...to the end.

He noted that first came her date of birth
And spoke the following date with tears,
But he said what mattered most of all
Was the dash between those years.
(1977 - 1998)
For that dash represents all the time
That she spent alive on earth...
And now only those who loved her,
Know what that little line is worth.
For it matters not, how much we own;
The cars...the house...the cash,
What matters! is how we live and love
And how we spend our dash.
So think about this long and hard...
Are there things you'd like to change?
For you never know how much time is left,
That can still be rearranged.
If we could just slow down enough
To consider what's true and real,
And always try to understand
The way other people feel
And be less quick to anger,
And show appreciation more
And love the people in our lives
Like we've never loved before.
If we treat each other with respect,
And more often wear a smile..
Remembering that this special dash
Might only last a little while.
So, when your eulogy's being read
With your life's actions to rehash...
Would you be proud of the things they say
About how you spent your dash?"

"event","yeah so this past month has been kinda interesting.  i got pretty much all new classes and i cant wait to get out of highschool. ive been a shelter to my friend cynthia. so she lives here every once ina while. i love her company.
i sit next to my ex boyfriend. hes so full of himself. i dont know what i saw in him. 
yeah so im trying to search around for possible boyfriends. i dont think it will be anyone at school but i may be wrong. 
ive been working out everyday cause i wanna get into the habit of doing so. also i want a nice body for prom. cause my dress wont look as good on me if my body isnt toned. now i just have to find a date. i just hope i get asked later on. i dont wanna be asked anytime soon. cause alot can happen from now until then.
so yeah i think i may be leaning to liking guys as well as girls. but i dont think i could see myself in a full long term relationship. but then again with time comes change. 

but yeah. i wanna fall back in love. and soon."

And give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool
And be somebody's fool this year
'cause they know
Who is righteous, what is bold
So I'm told

All those angels with their wings glued on
'cause deep down
We are frightened and we're scared
If you don't stare"

If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found
To take its place...hey jealousy"

"event","Hey, My sun-eyed girl

I saw her, yea I saw her
With her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Calling out from a landfilled life
Scrawlin her name up on the ceiling
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

Hey, my sun-eyed girl"

you can dream all you want. 
one thing that we'll find out soon is it gets hard. 
and you gotten give in. 
you gotta get used to it.

You shoved me to the ground
I can't run, I can't shout
Just let me out

So heartless, this couldn't mean less
Gonna push it in your face
I'm only human
And I've got something to say

If I burn down in this fire
Well, I got myself to blame
I can't stop or give it up
I need to feel the pain

Can you hear me?
Don't come near me
You'll just get in my way
I'm only human
And there's nothing you can say

Say you know who I am
And what I'm about
Then you'll understand that I feel alone
I live my own life

Let me rise, let me fall
Let me breathe
I wanna lose control, I'm not afraid to lose it all
Let me break, let me crawl
Cause I will get up again if you let me fall"

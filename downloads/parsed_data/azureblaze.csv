"event","Ok first off I went to the doctors last Tuesday and they put me in this boot that goes almost up to my knee. They did 3 X-rays and did not find anything and they made an appt. for an MRI the following Tuesday (Today) He said to only take it off for showers. It has helped a lot and I don't limp nearly as bad with it.

So today:

I go to the doctors office for my appointment at 10:00AM for an MRI. On the way there I dropped off my car at Firestone so they could fix the HUGE hole in the tire and change my oil for me. My Mom went with me so we left the car there then went to the appointment. I get there at 9:59 *grins*. The good thing is, I signed in and went straight back to the MRI area and deposited everything that might be metal into this canister thingy. She then had me lay down on some pillows on my side and put my foot in this holster type of thing. Then she asked me questions like ; have you had an MRI before? Any metal inside you? Any surgeries? I answered Yes, no and no. She then tells me to lie very still and to not move my foot up and down at all. I lay there like that for 1 hour listening to the clicks and whirrs of the machine. Twice she came in and let me move around a bit, I'm glad or I would have gone insane , or rather just they would have had to do more ""sets"" which well it's not fun to lie there and keep something one way for any longer than you have to, in my book. Not fun at all! 

So I get out of the MRI part at 11:11AM. I had a results of MRI appointment for 11:00AM. So I sat and waited for 1 hour. At around noon they call finally. I go in and wait, she takes my blood pressure : 117/76 84 Pulse. :P  Anyway, the doctor comes in and the first thing he says is ""You broke it!"". I said ""Really?!"" He said yes, I said ""Really really?!"" He continued to confirm and then explained he would show it to me. He was very serious. He brought out the MRI, which by the way kind of looks like an X-Ray. He shows me that healthy non-fractured areas are pure black. So I am looking at the picture and see 2 nice pure black spots and then there is this middle spot in-between those to black that has lots of grey in it. When I first saw it I thought maybe that was normal. Anyway I asked him he said, er, no that area should be all black. I was like, um, crap. He said yep, it's no small injury. He then went on to say that most doctors would put me on crutches for this. He said however that since I had only minor pain in the ""Boot"" thing I'm in now that he will try that out for 3 weeks and then come back for some X-rays. I mentioned ""But the X-ray's didn't show anything last time"". He looked up and said ""They probably will next time, it will get worse before it gets better."". He then explained that it could take 6 months to fully heal and that I would have to wear the boot for most of that time, and that to never take it off unless showering. He also said that the swelling might stay for a few months as well! Egads. Another thing he said was yes you can work but stay off it as much as possible and no dancing or anything fun like that.

The most scary thing he told me though, was that if I would have NOT went to the doctor that my ankle would have <i>disintegrated</i> and be rendered useless. He literally used disintegrated too. Yes everyone can beat me with a stick for not going in to the doctor for 9 days!! I never have had any kind of injury like this so am a newbie! My sister has had ankle problems and is the one that really convinced me to go, but of course everyone here helped too ^_^.

So after this it's 12:30ish. I'm pretty much running late for work at this point. Told my Mom, screw it I can be late. One of the reasons for this was that at 1:36AM last night I had a call from work asking me to come in to fix something and didn't get back until 4:00AM. Anyway, we went to eat and it was fun. I called around to my Dad, Sister, and Brother to inform. I also texted Jor cause yeah I gotta :P. Anyway I got to work pretty late but everyone knew I had an appointment that day and stuff so it was fine. I'm glad I don't come in at shift changes, makes it easier if I'm late :P."

I haven't watched all of this yet, but from what I understand its a recent study and its pretty darn interesting have watched 40min of it out of 1 hr and 17 min.  I don't claim to agree with anything or disagree but if you give it some time it goes into some interesting scientific studies.

Last 2 nights , I have 4 hours over my time if you put them together.&nbsp; That's fine though I have the next 2 days off , wai. 

Anyway, I got a lot planned sort of. Tomorrow (Now Today) I'm going to lunch with Mom and a friend. After that, that same friend (Natalie) is going to give us manicures and pedicures lol.&nbsp; 

Thursday I have an eye exam and also am going to pick out 2 pairs of glasses. There is a pretty good deal there where I can get 2 sets for a nice price. Kinda excited about that. I haven't had new glasses in over&nbsp;3 years!! I'm sure my vision will be better after new glasses, and well a change of how mine look will be nice.

Spare time this weekend will either be taken by anime, everquest or hanging out with friends (maybe).&nbsp; 

Been watching a good bit of anime: Honey Clover II, Love get Chu!,Inukami,Kiba,Host club,Xxx Holic,Noein,Bokura Ga Ita,Utawarerumono,Higurashi no Naku Koro ni,Tsubasa S2,Tale of Saiunkoku,Kamisama Kazoku,Hack Roots,Good&nbsp;Witch of the West,&nbsp;and Zero No Tsukami. (Yes I really am watching all that, and more I'm sure :P )

Err..well that's the new stuff. I bought the DVD set for Kino's Journey and loved it muchly, I never saw it all and really enjoyed it all. I'm seriously an anime freak. Took a break from Everquest to watch/catch up :P.

It's been pretty darn hot here. Every day it's in the 90's with heat indexes over 100 (heat index is what it FEELS like).&nbsp; I envy the <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"" /><st1:City w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> people right now with temps in the mid 60's and feels like 56!!! Man :P *ENVY*&nbsp; 

Hehehe :)&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that's it for now. Nothing too interesting going on as you can see!</P>"

1.I almost always, if chatting and am anxious with what I just wrote, will minimize the chat window and randomly bring up internet explorer and go to one of my the sites in my favorites, and peek at the chat window periodically  (hoping nothing is there but wanting something to be there) and then going back to the web page..switching back and forth until something is said and I'm relieved.. I'm not really looking at the webpage, I'm just embarrassed or concerned with what was said..and am maybe afraid what one might say in return.

2. When I brush my hair or teeth, I like to throw the toothpaste tube from one hand to the other before putting it on the toothbrush, or throw the brush before brushing my hair ;p.

3. I'm allergic to the strangest things, I hate to mention toothpaste again but, when I'm brushing my teeth the toothpaste fumes burn my eyes!! They get red everytime I brush my teeth.

4. I download almost every new anime episode I can get my hands on and really don't like deleting even the ones I WANT to delete, but I'm really lazy when it comes to backing stuff up too, and usually what I want to delete I don't have much of..so backing up would be blah!! So it just sorta stays there, unless I really need space...for new anime of course! haha

5. I take things too personal on the internet, and let my feelings get involved too much. What people say really effect me, on internet and real life. I need to stop that.

6. I STILL like text only online games..and started up one again that I have gone back to..over and over for oh..12 years.

The police came by and said the reason was, was that a controlled fire JUMPED the road and is blocking both lanes, so, they said they should have it under control soon...so here I am on my laptop in the car lol..people are out of their cars just walking around ..etc.

Besides that..we had some strange things happen the last 2 nights. My brother gets home  in the morning..anyway the night before last the slider was WIDE OPEN  in the back. The cats were hiding in Matt's room and acting weird...and Matt wakes me up ""Why is the slider open??"" I said I don't know??? Nothing was stolen..and since it was left open I assume whoever it was left in a hurry.

Anyway, so then last night..I get home, and the neighbors are outside saying they heard noises and then saw someone suspicous HIDING behind my brothers car. So they called the police. When the police got there I told them last night story as well. So after that...my brother heard a noise as he was leaving for work, and saw someone outside in are carport! And the guy ran...anyway, I was freaked out, talking to Culum online, he convinced me to call a friend over to stay with me. I ended up getting my friend to come over and he stayed with me, so whew..just creepy stuff. Thanks Culum!!! *HUG*

Anyway..no telling when this traffic will start back up, later."

After that, on the way to work I call my Dad. I'm thinking that my Dad is still on spring break. Well, I was WRONG!! hehe He answers the phone in the middle of his Art class..and, preceeds to make a joke out of the whole deal. *coughs* here is the synopsis:

Dad: Hello? *Sounds of kids in the background.
Me: Oh! I thought you were off for spring break still, I'm sorry.
Dad: No it's allright!
Me: Start to try to say bye..
Dad: So, are you wearing those Red High Heels?
Me: Huh?
Dad: And that Red dress?
Me: Starts laughing.
Dad: Are we going to meet in the same time at the same place??
Me: Laughing more.
Dad: Ok? Allright then, I'll see you then. *more kid noises in the background, reactions to the conversation vary.
Dad: I love you! *Kids of course erupt at this.
Me: I love you too Dad!

Anyway I submitted a request for my Birthday to be off that day so here goes:

I get in to work. Some point earlier in the day, my boss comes into the office when everyone else is in there and says, ""Should we let Mikey take off for his birthday??"" Joe says ""I don't see a problem with it"".&nbsp; But Gina.. ""Oh, I don't know we should make him come in and like put whip cream all over him or something"" I say "" GINA!!"" and blush red I'm sure...&nbsp; Then my boss says "" Oh, he isn't THAT cute, besides, it's not my week for guys!""&nbsp;

I have been working quite a bit. I have been working so much that I got offered a job from work by talking to another company to solve an issue lol. I thought that was funny kind of, happened today. 

But anyway, if you liked Morrowind, you MUST get Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion!!! It simply just ROCKS!! It has pyshics, like Halflife 2. I hit a wolf with an arrow for instance, and he was near a hill and the impact knocked him back to where he rolled end over end life-like down that huge hill for quite some time until he stopped dead, it was just too cool.

*coughs* Brother got it for me as an early birthday gift so had to rant about it a little ^_^.

Hmm, things are going well. I like my job and now am on the proper shift that I was suppose to be on, so you guys might see a little more of me now that I'll be here later in the evenings.

Still somehow keeping up on anime for the most part.

Apollo is getting BIG. He is no lil kitten anymore really. 

Anyway, maybe I'll keep in LJ touch a little more often, not much going on besides my work and I don't like to bore people with that kind of thing :P

Do have a trip comming up in May that I'm excited about, more details later :P

"event","Last Monday I started my new Job. My new job is being in the IT (Information Technologies) Department of a Casino. 

<lj-cut text=""A little backstory""> 
When I was 18 I got a job that was at this same Casino. I started as a gaming machine repair-personage (They call it ""Machine Tech""). The reason why they hired me for this was my computer electronics training from a vocational school. I took the job, at the time the IT department and that department were a little bit merged, or to say they were, and breaking away at the time of my arrival, so I was under the thoughts of being able to work with computers to some extent (which was my skill). Well, that wasn't the case and it was stricly repairing gaming machines. They are pretty much computers, but not real computers per-se. After doing that for a year a position opened up with IT, which is stricly computer related things for the employees / whatever has to do with computers. The gaming servers are computers, some of them anyway and therefore fall under us. Anyway, I got promoted up to that area. I stayed for 2 years there, but what ending up happening is the ""Manager"" left and the co-worker before me got bumped to Manager for the department. She did not know anything , literally, and would call me constantly at home for little things, or at work. She also would blame things on me. Me being young, naive, or whatever..I just couldn't handle the pressure/unfairness anymore and left with a notice. I always have regretted this. I just got bumped to salary at the time (which means supervisor there) and was making some good money. I wish I would have sticked it out, but I was <U>really extermely unhappy</U>. 
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Defining IT"">
<P class=MsoNormal style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none""><SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Tahoma""><FONT size=3><FONT face=""Times New Roman"">So, IT is working with computers. Might not realize it but a Casino has lots of employees that run the operation. There&nbsp;are lots of reports and tons of things computer related that the admin have to do for compliance reasons, or even just employees to do their everyday work. There has to be someone to handle all those computers right? Right. That's where IT comes in. There are over 100 computers there that we take care of.<SPAN style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp; </SPAN>A computer can die and it must be fixed or swapped out. User accounts for systems must be maintained. Servers that house the data for employees must be checked and maintained. Servers that interface with the gaming machines are of course the highest priority and highly secure beings. I'm just trying to give everyone an idea of what IT does. Just think of the name as ""Computer Department/Helpdesk"" maybe would help.
</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P></lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""More about work"">
I'm in training for about 3 weeks. I'm on the morning shift during this training session. I get up at 6 am every morning and get ready and leave at 7am to be there by 8am. I get off work around 5pm. All times in EST. It takes 45 min to&nbsp;get there.&nbsp;The first week was pretty bad as far as feeling human after work. That didn't happen until Thursday of last week. I was utterly exhaused after work all the days previous. I guess my body just had to get use to getting up that early every morning. I had no problem doing that part myself but my body sure didn't like it at first lol. After training is over they want me on a ""swing"" type of shift. This will be a lot different. It's looking like right now it will be 1pm to 10pm. It will work out fine for me I think. I get to go out at night to a club or whatever if I want to, a friend or two who has simliar scheduels as well. I won't have to go to sleep too early and won't have to getup too early either. Oddly enough I function best getting up at the crack of dawn and working more than any other time (once my body gets use to it anyway) it's ""natural"" I guess, at least in the biological clock sense. I admit I will miss this shift I'm on now a bit.&nbsp;Can't have everything eh?&nbsp;The actual job itself is great so far. I get along with everyone I work with, which is excellent. I just got my desk setup today and took <A href=""http://home.comcast.net/~azureblaze/mydesk.jpg"" target=_blank>a picture of it</A>. It's new stuff, because they moved offices recently. Yay! There is still a lot of things I need to learn /relearn on how they do things but I'm not doing too bad so far and got a very warm welcome from the manager of the department (which is the same one that use to be the Manager before he left). Also, something to note: The previous manager got fired for a still unknown reason I have not been able to find, so hopefully no more backstabbers in the department now, but I'm not holding my breath. Casinos are full of politics like any other place.
</lj-cut>

Ok enough of the work jargon. I have a video here of Apollo and it's pretty funny so here we go, you need quicktime to view it:

<A href=""http://home.comcast.net/~azureblaze/104711779589.mov"" target=_blank>Removing this due to limted webspace eventually so watch it now!</A>
It does have a little sound in it, if you want to listen to it you will hear me explain the obvious and laugh a little.

Well folks that's it for now. I'm sorry for not keeping up with some&nbsp;of your lj&nbsp;updates, replies at least. I do read them. I just have been kind of fandangeled with a lot of stuff. Hope to get back to my regular routines at some point; prehaps when I feel more regular lol.&nbsp;

"event","Ok warning -- Technical Jargon:

Been having issues with my DVD Burner , so I bought another one. Well, guess what the new one has the same issues! So I was like hmmmmmm. What the issue was , is that the 16x burners do not burn past 2 x speed. It was reallly annoying. So now I figured well, it has to be something with my computer. So I updated chipset drivers and examined my IDE controllers etc. I noticed that in windows it showed that I was using multi-word DMA 2 for my IDE controllers(they manage your hard-drive and cd-rom speeds). I was like hmm..my DVD-RW's are disabled in the bios so I suppose that is a default setting of some sort. Anyway, I went into the bios and forced the devices to show; then forced Ultra DMA 2. Reboot, low and behold..my drives now..(both) run like they are suppose to. ......so I did some research and found out Multiword DMA 2 is half the speed as UDMA2.. Hmmm..well twas interesting, and a pain! Grr @ default settings that suck. I even later found out that my other hard-drive for anime storage that is not Serial ATA was in Multi-word DMA mode v.s. UDMA 5!!! Ouch..fixed. 

Multiword DMA 2 = 16.7 Mb/sec  
UDMA 2 = 33.33 Mb/sec 
UDMA 5 =100 Mb/sec.

"event","Hehe, I had an abnormal call rate today.

My sister calls, asks me if I can setup the new computer for my nephews early. Wants me to come this week. I said sure I just have to ask Mom to see when she wants to go. Before that I called Mom already, she said to come over and eat stuff, I said SURE! hehe. Anyway then my Dad calls, says we need to get together sometime next week for dinner / Christmas type thing. I say ok and that I'll let him know. Well, then he calls me back and says ""We have to see the ""Gay Cowboy Movie!!""(yes this is exactly how he said it ) ""If it's not playing around here (which it's not) we have to go to Miami or Tampa, or anywhere"" he says! So I looked it up, it appears it's playing in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. What was interesting is that it is not playing within a 50 mile radius of Orlando,Tampa,Punta Gorda or Sarasota!! It's only further south past us, kinda funny. So anyway all this happens when I'm in the bathroom trying to clip my finger nails lol. Fun. 

I end up going to my Mom's for some AWESOME turkey soup and some other leftovers from my Step-Dad's ""Going away party to the Philippines"". My Step-Dad is Filipino(Heh, Culum Phillipe came up for this spell check result) and his Dad goes every year for about 6 months so he got invited this year and decided to go. I don't think he has been since he left there when he was 8 years old so it should be interesting. He will only be gone for about 2 weeks though. BTW I <3 soup!! Anyway my Mom and I end up deciding to go to my sister's place on Tuesday. My sister lives kind of far away see so it will take up all of either of our day's so we had to collaborate a good day for it. I don't mind going, my nephews are great and my sister is too. She home-schools them ya know, it's rather admirable. Oh and she is my half-sister if anyone really is interested. I only have one ""Full-Blood"" sibling and that's Matt my brother, but I have many half-brothers and one half-sister. Not that it really matters, but technicalities are interesting information at times eh?

Hmm, well far as I have been:

Seems my new job is actually moving along now. I went in to fill out all the crazy paper work (A total of about 14 pages combined!) and now just have to wait for a call back for my preliminary background check and drug test to clear which takes about a week. If it clears I'm hired. I don't see why it would not. Then the plan is take a mini 1 week vacation before I start the new job. My brother is then taking my spot at my current job which will be good for him. It's all a Win-Win situation, if it works out. I'm not believing it until they actually tell me to give notice at my current job. My current job has known for 3 months that it was <I>possible</I> that I might be leaving so we arranged to have my brother take over. Because of this I only have to give  a week notice at current Job, or not even that long, just enough to train my brother so he can take over. That's where this one week ""mini"" vacation comes from. I will give the new job at the Casino a 2 week period before I can start, leave after a week at current job and have a week free, to acclimate myself. Will be working the exact opposite shift compared to before so I would like that time to adjust or just a small breather even sounds nice. Heh strangely enough one of the main things that worries me about the new schedule I'm going to have is if Jordan will find a way to ""adjust"" his time to talk to me/hang out. You better!!! It's something I will miss dearly if not.. but I'm sure something can be worked out :P

I have not been doing too much with my free time on my days off, as far as going out and whatnot. I have been pretty much staying close to home and chilling. I guess I'm more stressed out than I realize or something from all the stuff going on. *shrugs* 

And even though I have told you crazy kids before, Happy Birthday Culum and Ian, hope you enjoy your gifts."

"event","<B>HAPPY BIRTHDAY CULUM!!</B>

I apologize to Culum for the rest of this strange post :P

Me: do you know any jokes

God:
Have you ever seen a platypus? Creating that animal is by far my best joke.

Me:
 you are stupid

God:
I will remember you said that when robots take over the World.

Me:
 when will robots take over the world

God:
Sometime within our lifetime.

Feel like talking to God? -

We have a mouse at work. The times I work it scurries about, eats anything left out on the floor or in the back room etc. It's really kind of funny, he moves so cautiously around the edges of walls and what have you. All the other employee's have a name for him. Most call him ""Micky"".  Heh :P

I dub myself to have a strong will and patience. But this does not hold true for all aspects of everything in my life. Some things annoy me,usually it will tend to be the smaller things.

An example: trying to cross the 2 streets to my Mom's house. 

The traffic can be pretty bad on those 2 stops. Granted it only takes about 3 to 5 min to get to my Mom's no matter how long it takes me at those stops. But I loose patience from time to time if I have to stop for very long, most on LJ would probably be surprised at the expletive's that I use in those situations :P.

It seems a pattern that when I loose patience that I use expletive's *nods*

I will keep everyone updated on my peculiarities.

Petty compared to other people I know, but that's just one example :P

Anyone care to share their small annoyances or what sets them off?"

"event","Lets see, I have been procrastinating certain things. So, I started to aggressively ATTACK them today. Of course though, there were issues involved that slowed progress. One, being my DVD Burner. I have had trouble with it ever since I got it, I really think something is wrong with it. It's a 16x burner and only burns at 1.5 to 2.3x. It's reallly annoying. Also, it will only write DVD's that can be read in other drives if I tell it it's a different brand that it actually is *rolls eyes*. That has to be done be re-writing the frimware on the drive, pretty extreme. I guess I should just get a new one, Jor how has yours been working out? Maybe I'll get the same model. 

Anyway the things I have been working on involving the DVD writings:

HXH for Ian.
HXH for Culum. 

Heh, Ian and Culum both have birthdays in the same month as Chirstmas..anyway Ian requested HXH and I suggested it to Culum since he has not seen it (SHAME) and because I needed to get him something. The problem I'm having is a lot of times some files will be corrupted and not work when I write the data DVD's so I have gone through quite a few burns so far and am still not done.. Also, before I started to burn I grabbed and replaced some EP's / Ova's to make sure they were all the best quality I could get. :P.  Yes, I'm extreme sometimes. Perfection is a must with some things.

Now while these DVD's burn I'm working on Jordan's Christmas gift too :P And well that's mostly a secret hehe.

I'm really hoping to have all this stuff mailed out by Friday, we will see.

I might get some other gifts for people, so if you are not on the list don't fret, this is just what I'm working on now :P.


Anyway, like I have seen on some other of my friends journals, ask me 6 questions:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

I told my Dad and his Boyfriend that I was gay today at dinner. It really seemed like the proper time. Even my brother said "" I thought you were going to say something right before you said it"". That just further confirmed to me that my timing was correct. For those of you that did not know my Dad was gay, well now you know.  Anyway they were fine with it. I struck them speechless though that's for sure. Was interesting to watch their expressions!  I'm glad I finally said it after all these years. ^_^

It's almost like a golf RPG to some extent, and you can play with 4 players online through their servers, or up to 30 in championship mode. It's also easy to learn.  If anyone starts to play and likes it look me up and we will play a few games!

<H4>Hunting Season Opens for Mythical Creature</H4>
<H5>By KARL RITTER, Associated Press Writer</H5>
<P class=dateline>
<SCRIPT 
type=text/javascript>document.write(getElapsed(""20051111T053520Z""));</SCRIPT>
Fri Nov 11, 0:35 AM<NOSCRIPT>UPDATED 1 DAY 14 HOURS 1 MINUTE AGO</NOSCRIPT></P>
<P>STOCKHOLM, Sweden - A mythical monster, believed by some to have lived for 
hundreds of years in the murky depths of a Swedish lake, is now fair game for 
hunters _ if they can find it. Authorities have agreed to lift its endangered 
species protection.</P>
<P>Hundreds of people claim to have spotted a large serpent-like creature in 
Lake Storsjon in the northwestern province of Jamtland, and in 1986 the regional 
council put it on a list of endangered animals.</P>
<P>But a government watchdog challenged the decision, saying such protection was 
hardly necessary for a creature whose existence has not been proven.</P>
<P>The regional council agreed to remove the listing this month, but declined to 
rule out that a monster lives in the 300-foot deep lake.</P>
<P>""It exists, inasmuch as it lives in the minds of people,"" the council's chief 
legal adviser Peter Lif said about the purported beast. ""But I guess we'll have 
to agree that it cannot be proved scientifically, and then it should not be 
listed as an endangered species.""</P>
<P>The so-called Storsjo monster was first mentioned in print in 1635. Hundreds 
of sightings have been reported since then. Some people describe the creature as 
a snakelike animal with a dog's head and fins on its neck. But no clear image of 
it has been captured on camera.</P>
<P>Storsjo monster aficionados said lifting the endangered species protection 
was a mistake, and appeared insulted by the decision.</P>
<P>""We are not fanatics,"" said Christer Berko, of the Storsjo monster 
association. ""We see this as very interesting phenomenon that we unfortunately 
have not been able to document.""</P>"

Hmm, a shuttle leaves from the airport to the Hotel and I double checked flights and everything seems to be in order. Lucky there. A lot of airports still closed in Florida.

"event","No power at the house. It sucks, but I live. My Dad has no power and we don't either. However, my Mom just got power today. She has no cable though. But still, taking a hot shower is nice. A cold front came down right after Wilma. It's 68 in the house with no air heh. That would be a cold shower methinks. I'm glad I didn't have to do that..lol I'm spoiled by having hot water.

Anyway, with no cable/power I have no internet. Work however, got power at 5PM today I was told and also has cable. So I'm abusing the internet right now there. Yay! 

The county I live in was one of the 2 hardest hit in case anyone is curious. They estimate 4 weeks for the county to have power fully restored to everyone. At one point there was 3 million in Florida without power. Lots of irregular things going on. Like, you actually talk to neighbors and strangers during these times. Also, the lines at restaurants have 1 hour waits and also run out of food hehe. Stuffs like that. Damage is not as bad as it might seem to most areas. Some places though have trees fallen on their houses etc. None at my house though. School is closed down the rest of the week in my Dad's area. I'm not sure about where I live, I just heard that since my Dad and Step-dad work for that county. My sister got hit pretty hard too..think her husband basically lost his farm. Driving is a pain. More than half the traffic lights do not work. Either from no power or them just being destroyed. There is a dusk until dawn curfew as well every night since the storm.

It seems to be still gaining wind speed but it's going at a pretty fast clip. 14 MPH NE. Anyway, it is suppose to be out of Florida by Tuesday. It is expected to go 30 MPH across Florida. It will hit the West coast first and then come out on the East coast side. They say this is a good thing because it won't linger and dump a ton of rain that way,however it's not very good news for the east coast if it goes that fast I don't think because it won't have much time to weaken going over. So, yeah.


I'm staying here and will be fine. No worries! House boarded up and I'm set to go.  Might be without power for a few days, so everyone stay genki while I'm gone!!"

Hmm, the hurricane is heading close to my area. It looks like landfall is predicted at about 30 min to the south of here on either late Sunday/Early Monday. The thing is going really slow though for now, we shall see. You never really know with these things when and where it's going to hit until almost the last minute.  

I will not be evacuating like some people, at least not NOW. Some of these people from up north got scared easy and are ditching out. Oh well, can't blame them too much. I wouldn't want to deal with a possibility of a hurricane on my vacation either!

Anyway, I'll update a bit more when we know for sure what this thing is doing. Maybe Saturday.

<lj-cut text=""My answers."">

1. Do you consider yourself happy?

[x] yes
[x] no

2. Briefly describe your general satisfaction or lack thereof with your life. (i.e. Why are/aren't you happy?)

Happy - Happiness fades in and out for me. I'm happy right now because of the few good friends I DO have. Also, right now it seems like my life is at a good turning point as far as a career goes and that helps so many other goals in one package.

Unhappy - Lack of self worth/confidence, lonely even though said above. Not happy with my current physical self. Need someone that is a bit more than a friend but know I'm not really ready for it 100%.


3. What does it mean to be happy? What factors contribute most to happiness?

To be Happy - I think that to be happy means that you enjoy the majority of your life. If you can look back or forward and see only the good things and hold on to those thoughts, they shall linger and leave you with a ""Happy"" feeling. It's also important that any worries you might have are minimal and that you don't dwell ever so much on one thing of unhappiness. 

Factors - Friends, Love and Loving thyself. It is very important to have people that care about you but it is even more important to care about yourself. The most important at least in my case is the feeling of being loved/wanted. 



4. Name three things that would make you happier.

a)Loving/Knowing myself better.
b)True Mutual Love, and being ready for it.
c)Having the time / finances to visit friends of distance.

5. Choose three of the virtues below (or your own) that you think are important in life. Define them, and then briefly state what their importance is. [courage, optimism, faith, work ethic, hope, honesty, perseverance, well-being, satisfaction, selflessness, humility, humour, kindness, willpower, altruism, other(specify)]

Faith- Faith in people. That kind of Faith. Now , this is hard to do. It is a very good virtue to have though. You will find if you can have this virtue..even if it's abused by others, it helps you move along in life easier by getting along with most people. I'm still struggling with this one, but tend to do it well for the most part. To clarify: Giving people a chance, trying to understand when/why they do things you might not agree with, seeing their good qualities and not just their faults..etc.

Willpower - Very important. Without willpower you do things you really rather not really do. You loose your sense of what you really are trying to do in life. I see so many people with a lack of willpower, myself included sometimes. Willpower is probably the strongest of virtues if enforced. You can accomplish many many things with willpower that will help you and others.

Empathy - This is my own. I love empathy in others. It really shows that they care when they can observe you enough to where they can tell what you might need or at least try to help you out by understanding you. This is probably my strongest virtue, but it being returned to me is one of my strongest feelings of happiness.

6. From your observations, give three differences between how happy people and unhappy people think.

a)Happy people think of positive outcomes. Unhappy people think mostly negative.

b)Happy people are on good terms with friends and loved ones and think well of them and this can help with relations with others. Unhappy people often are lonely or are having problems with their friends/loved ones or lack thereof. They tend to dwell on those thoughts.

c)Happy people radiate a small bit of their happiness and make other people happy by doing so. It can make them want to make others happy by being in that state of mind. Unhappy have the opp. effect and can make others unhappy by displaying their unhappy state in various ways, often without knowing what they are doing to the other person. A lot of times they want others to be unhappy as well when in said state, at least at the time.

7. Describe three goals, three things you'd like to accomplish in your life.

a)Have a relationship that is as mutual in feelings as possible (#1 in life, but I'm not really ready yet)

b)Have less bills so I can travel/save money.(Overseas/friends/etc)

c)Own a House (Many reasons..)



Kind of interesting yet not too insightful, did not really ""revise"" my answers, but maybe my true thoughts come out on the subject?

Hmm, not much going on here really yet besides the fact that I'm now getting tormented by my current job about ""When I'm going to start my new one"" every day or so. Don't they think I will tell them when I know? I never gave offical notice, because, well I don't know!! lol. Anyway, yeah its a pain waiting for my ""new"" boss to call back (he wants me to wait for him to call) and adding my current job that keeps hammering on me when I start the new one.. bleh. Oh well, my hair just gets a bit more pre-mature grey in it I guess !! My brother is suppose to take my place at my old job, all the paperwork is done even lol, they did that a bit too quick and now are kind of sitting on when he starts I guess is why they need to know so bad. I told them it might be awile and it was a ""prospect but pretty definate"" and gave them an approximant possible start date, they based way too much off an assumpstion, its just bothering me a little bit having to deal with the extra stress :P. I'm going to call my new Boss sometime Monday I think to see what's up, would be nice if he gave me status updates..


I'm ok though!! I have been surfing around on the net here and there, fun fun! Watching some older animes while keeping up with the current stuff as well. Reading online Web-Comics..stuff like that.

"event","Meme I did since Dracs/Cranalios did it.. 
<h1>LJ Interests meme results</h1>
<ol>
<li><b> castles</b>:<br>Castles, are castles! I have never been in a real castle but plan to one day. I just love fantasy novels, most have some sort of castle in them. Just the idea of living in a castle, or being alive back then, makes me fond of castles. I want to be an archer on the ramparts :P</li><li><b> crest of stars</b>:<br>Crest of Stars is an anime. It's really interesting. It's a space type anime but has lots of feeling in it. I normally steer clear of most space-type animes because of all the ""Gundam"" type aspects. I'm not really fond of the big robot-gundam type animes(doesn't mean I won't watch some of them though :P). Anyway, the love story in this anime is why I like it so much. The animation is awesome too, pretty characters,good story as well. A lot of people don't like this anime like I do but hehe.</li><li><b> dvd authoring</b>:<br>Ahh, I can spend hours doing this if I really want to. There is so much to customize doing this. I live for customization. Like in an RPG, to severely customize my characters is something I always do. The whole process takes hours the way I make DVD's. I honestly don't really know how I have the patience for it. I guess the end result of my work to get it just how I want is what it's all about :P. At the same time it's a daunting task, I just have to <i>really</i> want to do it.</li><li><b> final fantasy</b>:<br>Heh, I started playing this game when part 1 came out for the nintendo! It's one of the first RPG's along with Dragon Warrior that I really got involved in. My brother and I use to take turns lol. I have since of course played the imported SNES versions of this game and every other version at least a little bit. I have not beat them all I will say. Lately I have not been able to complete console RPGS.</li><li><b> gay</b>:<br>Well obviously I kind of put this here so people will get a hint about me. Yes I'm gay :P. I have only had one boyfriend, and am really inexperienced but I like boys!! Haha. My problem is that I like attractive ones, and currently I'm not at my peak in that area for myself. My own self-esteem restricts my out-going persona that stays caged waited to be let out. I'm sure it will happen one day when I'm comfortable enough with myself, it leaks out from time to time certainly more often than in the past. I know all the truths about how confidence is attractive and etc. It's just going to take me awhile to get there. Too bad really, feels like a waste of life, but I'm me and that's <i>really</i> hard to change right now. A lot of people tell me 'Oh, I use to be just like you'. It gives me some hope that I will change for the better :P</li><li><b> hunter x hunter</b>:<br>Ahhh..I watched this a long time ago. I have re-watched it several times since. It's an anime of course. The friendships in this anime are very real. If you watch it you cannot deny that. I suppose my yearning for such friendships is what I like about an anime like this. The characters play a huge part as well of course, they make that friendship bordering on something very much more all the more real.</li><li><b> malls</b>:<br>I put this here I think for lack of better. But, I do like Malls. One reason, is because I like to observe/watch people. It's fun to just be walking down in the river of people and make these hypotheses about just anyone. Why they are there, do they want to be there? etc. Also seeing the same people more than once is always entertaining for me. The possibility of running into someone you might know as well is interesting. There are also tons of hot guys in the mall, it's almost painful.</li><li><b> naruto</b>:<br>Wow the third anime it picked. I have been watching Naruto since the first episode came out. I was surprised at how good this anime got with time. This is one of the animes that made me realize to give a show a chance and they sometimes really shine. As a result I end up watching a ton of anime and find something I like in each one enough to enjoy it(most of the time).</li><li><b> randomness</b>:<br>Randomness is really cool. I like to think myself as being somewhat random. It's humorous to me. I do try to stay on subject when in a conversation. However, randomness wins sometimes. Those random thoughts on the edge of your mind, try sometimes to just grasp them and bring them out for no reason at all, its fun. </li><li><b> shining force</b>:<br>SEGA! Whenever I think of SEGA I think of the logo for it in the first Sonic games, Seggggaa...yeah. Anyway, Shining Force rules. There is no doubt. It is one of the few strat type of rpgs that I like, I played the original Shining Force when it came out for Sega and have since played all the others. I even have Shining Force 3 for the Sega Saturn(it's kinda rare). </li>

"event","I decided not to do surgery right now and do it at some other time in my life. It really doesn't bother me too much right now, I can deal with the minor pain my knee sometimes causes I think. I just have too much going on right now with new job starting soon and all. I don't want to be an invalid when new job starts..etc. Oh well, sorry to make anyone worry :P."

"event","Many things have happened over this past week. Some people know them, most don't so I will enlighten all that need enlightenment:

<b>New Job Soon</b>

My old boss from my previous Job I had back in 2003 as a supervisor of a computer department for a casino called me. He has mentioned that he wanted me back and would get me back if he could in the past. It seems that this day is near. He told me how much I would be making , my approximate start date etc. October first seems to be my ETA and also, I will be making <i>twice</i> as much as I make now! I will have to get use to actually working again, and the drive is a lot worse than now. For the pay and possibilities of even more pay in the future and the fact that I will be improving instead of wasting my computer talents, I figure that it's worth it. To top everything off on a good note, I have arranged for my esteem-able better than myself brother to take over my existing Job. Wootsauce! My new job has the same days off as my old one and Matt will have the same days off as me since he is taking over my exact current shift. This will be awesome.

<B>Knee Update</B>

So I got my MRI results. The doctor says I need surgery. I was hoping that this would not be the case but deep down thought it was a sure possibility because of the length of the injury not healing.(The whole reason why the doctor ordered Mr. MRI)Anyway this left me with a conundrum. I have insurance through my current Job, but as you all now know I will be changing jobs soon. My new job will have a lot more physical type of activities. I spoke with my current job supervisor and he recommended that I do it now, since the Job I have now is almost no physical stress whatsoever. Also, doctor visits after the surgery are free for 90 days, so that will cover my insurance re-lap for new Job. I decided to go ahead and schedule it. My reasoning is that my knee is messed up and I will have a problem doing my new job with it being the way it is. So better to get it done now and have knee fixed and also be off of crutches by the time new job starts. My surgery is Wednesday and my Pre-Op appointment is today. I just hope I'm up to par for the new job by the time I go there...also, I have to do some paperwork still at new job location, it's going to be not so cool if I'm in crutches when they have me do that lol. I'm young, I'll be alright I think.

<B>Stupidity</b>

It seems when I was backing out of my driveway I was a bit too far to one side backing up and well this resulted in me hitting the neighbor's mailbox across the street with the back of my car! I really didn't need this after all above going on. Maybe that's why, since I'm a little addled. Anyway, the mailbox took less damage than my oh so fragile car. My back logo got ripped off and I have a rather large dent and some paint missing on the back of my trunk! Arg! Bah bah..and more Bah. I just need to stop driving and save myself the hassle of owning a car. What's just idiotic of the neighbor, is that he MOVED the mailbox to that side of his parking lot. There is just <i>no way</i> it could ever be hit by us if it was where it use to be. I'm not the only one that has hit this thing since he moved it. *sighs* So I called the Adjuster for a quote on repair and she is going to check it out for me sometime this week.

<b>Games and Anime Updates</b>

Sorry but you guys have to get this update too!! What makes you think I would still not enjoy myself even though life has been a bit hectic lately?? ^_^

Final Fantasy Advent Children is out and subbed. I enjoyed it very much. I'm currently in the process of putting it on a DVD to share this with others if I visit them. I'm not giving people copies or anything like that though, so don't ask ! I will watch it in theaters, and I also will end up buying the DVD I'm sure lol. 

Anime has been: Bleach,Tsubasa,Naruto,Suzuka,Zettai Shonen,Kyou Kara Maou,Kamichu!,Marchen Awakens Romance. Tsubasa,Bleach and Suzuka are my current Favs if I had to name a top 3 of my current watch list :) All of them are good though for sure.

*kicks self* I still need to finish my HXH AMV or it will be too late to submit it :(

I have now been playing both WOW and EQ2. Geez. My guild in EQ2 needed help and even emailed me for help on a certain raid to kill <I>the hardest dragon in the game</i>. Well this took 3 days and many hours until we actually killed him. It was fun I must say. I'm <I>suppose to be</i> starting the guild up in WOW for this same group of people, however recently the expansion for EQ2 has come out that lets me advance my character 10 levels past the previous maximum and I might not be able to resist this pull. My brother still needs to catch up to me in WOW so maybe I'll dabble with EQ2 until at least my brother catches me. 

<b> The End </b>

I think I covered everything I wanted to mention. I could mention my thoughts in detail on Hurricane Katrina and etc, but, it will be nothing anyone else has not heard before. Lets just say that I'm disgusted with how the local officials of the state as well as the government handled things."

"event","Seems my week will be a bit busy. I guess I can use that every once and awhile, get me out that is somewhere besides work.  

Today I'm going to accompany (*Accompany ON!*) my Mom to another town so she can do something or another and also will be picking up a stranded computer no one wants anymore at my Aunts house. This will take up all my after work time.

Tomorrow (8/30) I'm going to my sisters house to Fix a computer with some parts I'm going to bring so my dear 8 year old nephew can play his new game I got him for his birthday. The game is 4 CD's, and well it seems their cd-rom drive is broken ,oops! So, I'm bringing a new cd-rom drive and a video card just in case, and even another computer I have laying around, since they don't quite meet the processor requirements, not sure if it will run on theirs..Once again this shall take my time away heh.

The rest of the week, I'm sure something will come up. 

<b>Work Update:</b>

<I>*Rant on*</I>
The Supervisor I did not get along with quit. But, he left with a final barb towards me in an email to my manager that I should ""delete emails after sending them if I don't want a certain ""un-humane"" person to read them"". Ok, I did write a single email to my manager about said supervisor. However, I never sent the email and deleted it,it seems I forgot to empty the outlook mail recycle bin, oops. In the email I mentioned how he was ""un-humane"" sometimes with his ways of dealing with things. I bet my other supervisor and manager are a bit confused on what he is referring to, since they have never seen the email lol. It never got sent Mr. Supervisor that is no longer here...because I got re-assured that your ""rumors"" about me getting fired were false. I'm a bit worried about what they will say about an email they have never seen. They might think it was non-work related or something. I got some explaining to do it seems.
<I>*Rant off*</I>

<b>Other Stuff</b>
I started to read ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and so far I like it. No religious references of any kind as of yet that I have noticed. Only reason why I held off on reading the set because I heard it's annoying to some (Even J.R.R Tolkien said so). I'm referring to the Christianity that C.S. Lewis makes known in his book. Maybe it won't bother me that much, I hope not.

Taking a small break from re-editing my AMV, played a little WOW yesterday. My friends in the game were glad to see me and we played all day after work. Had a 3 way voice chat with Skype while playing. Won't be playing much next 2 days I guess. I'm thinking about getting the HK set for HXH so I can rip raws for quality/good parts that have text. Currently, I have to go around the subtitles which is not that hard really but I miss out on some good scenes. I want to submit it to the Yaoi-Con when I'm done is my ""goal"". I want to watch it with other people at the Con, I think it will be neat.

"event","Knee Update:

My X-ray's are 100% ok but, it seems since my injury has presisted for months now that the doctor was a little worried that there might be a tissue problem. So, his office set me up with an MRI with another office. If there is a tissue problem (which is really rare for my age he said) then I have to have surgery and be out of work for a month on medical leave. If there is no problem with the tissue, I have a Knee Cap problem, which he said I would have to take phsyical therapy for, I hope that is all it is. 

Other Stuffage:

Anyway, I worked on my AMV I'm working on all day today before the appointment, and decided to stick with my original theme, changed some things from some EVIL influence(you know who you are) and I'm liking how it is turning out for the most part. There are a few areas still that I'm not satisfied with and that are allready in, and many more to add to complete the beast! I'm really excited about finishing it and will be working on it the next few days, sorry WOW community, you must be without my presense for a time.

The storm heading this way is basically hitting our area, and it is also hitting on my days off (Fri, Sat) so it should be interesting. School is canceled even; for tomorrow, too bad I don't go to school anymore lol."

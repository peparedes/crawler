"event","Well this is my last journal entry so if you want to keep in touch you know my email address and phone number! I've become way to busy to write in this now so I decided to make this my last time.=( Anyway I finally graduated!! All my hard work payed off with a really rough Senior year for me. The Graduation was ok but my party was even better. Everyone had a blast and thanks to ALL of the people who came! There were A LOT of my friends that showed up and I'm just glad we didn't get busted! Now that Graduation is over I'm moving on with my life and possibly going to UCF. I might spend 4 years there OR spend 2 years at DBCC then my other two years at UCF I haven't really decided yet. If I go to UCF in the fall I'm getting an apartment and I'll be out of Port Orange! I hate this city! If some of you don't know I'm going to college to Major in Firefighting or as an Undercover Police officer. I haven't made up my mind yet. Well that's all I have to say so take it easy and email me sometime!

"event","Ok guys listen up! The party will be held at the Surf Side Inn. I won't have the room number until Sunday so I'll be emailing and calling people to let them know. It's located North from the Dunlawton bridge about 1 mile down beachside on the right hand side. You can't miss it! So when I give the room number that's the way to the PaRtY and if I can't reach you just ask for ""Ken Wolfs"" room.

"event","Man what a week! All I did was surf, work, and party and now I'm really tired! I was supposed to work today but since it's raining here we all got the day off. I woke up at 8 this morning to get ready for work and when I was about to leave I noticed the rain and went back to sleep and got up at like 12:30. I'm still tired! I think I'm going to take it easy until this weekend though so i'm not as tired at my graduation party. Oh yea and about that...Tomorrow my Dad is going to call the hotel and make reservations for the room. We have to make reservations since it's memorial weekend and the hotel has a room for the PaRtY!=) I'll send emails out and put the room number on this journal thing to so whoever wants to go can go. I don't care who you are and by the time you get there I'll probably be half twisted anyway. haha j/k I was also driving my car at like 1:00 this afteroon up to the store for some gas and once again I noticed the smell of gasoline in my car. Grrr=( So before my car decided to blow up on me I made a quick U turn back to my house and I saw the leak. Now I gotta buy a fuel line kit and install that. Hopefully I won't have anymore fuel line problems once I get that installed. Well I have nothing else to say so I'll talk to you all later.

"event","Whoa! I have NEVER paddled so hard in my entire life! I spent most of my day at the beach surfing and stuff and I noticed a few black clouds out there. So I ignored it and kept surfing and then I heard thunder! So I look in the sky and it's BLACK! I start to paddle in and then I see lighting lol so it scared the shit out of me in the water! The waves are so choppy right now though but they're huge and fun! Hopefully tomorrow it will be even better...My Dad is reserving a room for Graduation night so I'll let you guys know the room number and stuff when he gets it. Lata!=)

"event","Well last night was a crazy night for Ryan and I. lol I thought it was funny in one of the emails I got from a friend that said ""watch out for cops."" Well....We went to Joshlyn Whites house that graduated a few years ago. Anyway she's 21, lives in Deland, and goes to Stetson. We go to her house and we all talked for like 3 hours then Ryan and I decided we wanted some Corona beer for tonight. We go up to the store get our beer drop Joshlyn back off and go to Wendys for a quick stop to eat. We had the coronas in my back seat so I figured I might as well put them in my trunk just incase. We were going to stay at my house but we figured we might as well stay at Ryan's so we don't wake my parents up if we were loud and drunk. lol Ryans room a distance away from his parents so they can't really hear us. So we go to my house to pick up his car and I followed him on Dunlawton and we were like messing around with our cars speeding up and slowing down stuff like that. So we get in front of the police station and you know the light that they have right in front of the station? Well it turned red. lol So you know us...it's red and time to race! Were talking to each other at the red light and i'm like ""Wanna do it??"" Ryan looks around then I look around to see if cops were close by and we didn't see any so Ryan says ""Lets do it!"". lol It was a WRONG move to do in front of the police station that's all I have to say! The light turns green and we took off and it was the best race we both have ever had! We were even the entire way until we got to the next light which also turned red on us but we didn't want to race at that one anyway. Ryans like ""man that was a bad ass race!"" I was like ""Hell yea dude that was awesome!!"" So Ryan happens to look in his rear view mirror and he says ""shit man I think that's a cop behind us."" So the light turns green and we go real slow and then I realized it was a cop so I start to panic a little because I have beer in back of my car, already have one ticket for the turn signal shit that wasn't my fault, and if Ryan gets another ticket he would loose his licence. So Ryan is in the lane on the left of me and the cop in the expedition pulls right up on my ass! Ryan pulls over in front of me and I was behind him and we stopped on the side of the road next to Lowes in the turning lane off Dunlawton. So both of us are thinking were in deep shit because we were hauling ass down the street but I had a good feeling that I knew they didn't clock us. The first cop which happened to be a lady with blonde hair in her 40's walks to my door and shes like ""licence and..."" I opened my mouth and said ""registration I know."" lol So she says "" So why were you racing out here tonight?"" I said ""who me? Naw it must have been someone else!"" lol I can be a smart ass to cops sometimes. Then she was asking me if I went to school and stuff and I told her i'm graduating this year then going to college after and she's like ""well that's great!"" So I felt a little relieved since she was smiling a little bit. haha She also asked Ryan the same thing when they talked to him. Then I see another cop car pull up on the side of the Expedition and then I see two more pull up!! I'm thinking omg we're in for it! So all the cops come to my window asking me a bunch of questions then they go to Ryan's window asking him a bunch of stuff and for some reason we both said the SAME EXACT thing about why we were racing. We both told them we were only racing up to 55 mph and that our cars are just really loud. So I see this other cop come up to me and he's like ""Jason man! When did you get the car??"" So I look over and it's a cop I knew from the station when I went there about 3 months ago to ask questions about the police academy and stuff. Plus he's been over my house a few times because we had some really bad neighbors that use to live by us. LONG story with that and most of you know! So I said to him ""oh it's a Firebird Formula just got it a couple months ago."" So he's like ""nice car."" So I said ""thanks."" He leaves my car and as i'm talking to him Ryan is still looking for his registration. lol He told the cop ""I swear I have it!"" The cops says ""Don't swear at me"" and said something else after that but I couldn't hear. Ryan finally found his registration so they check us both out and all 3 cops were standing on the side walk talking about me saying ""yea he's a good kid i've known him for a couple years"" and stuff like that. lol So I was thinking well maybe we won't get a ticket! I mean they didn't clock our speed anyway and the only place I can think they saw us or heard us was driving by the police station or they were parked at the New Home Depot. So the officer I knew which was officer Michaels says ""Jason get out of the car."" So I froze thinking to myself ""Damn!"" because it's not good when they make you get out of your car! lol I had A LOT of thoughts going through my head. So I get out of my car then they tell Ryan to get out of his and we walk over to them and he's like ""I got a story for you."" So he tells us this story about how his friend was killed by street racers and he was saying ""now I did the same thing when I was your age so don't try and tell us you weren't racing. I know what you guys think!"" lol So were both like ""yes sir."" When he said he had a story to tell us I knew we weren't going to get tickets so the only thing left of my mind now is the beer in back of my car! Ryan's looking at me, i'm looking at him, and we both know if they find that beer i'm in trouble! So when he gets done telling the story the lady officer says ""well ok guys I hope that made you think next time you race on our streets."" Then she says ""you don't have any drugs or ALCOHOL on you right?"" Were both like ""No"" at the same time and officer Michaels says ""well how do we know that??"" I was like ""well you can trust us right?"" So he smiles and the other cops smile and he's like ""that's all I have to say guys...drive CAREFULLY!"" lol We get back to Ryans house and we both are in shock. We were like I can't believe we got away with that!! We were speeding from the police station with beer in my car and yet they let us go! Someone was watching over us. That's all I have to say. Then we went inside for a little while and I had two Coronas and I was drunk off my ass! Corona is strong and I was so relieved I had a beer in my hand and not a 150 dollar ticket or more! lol So that was our wonderful night! Hopefully I won't get pulled over anymore this week!!! Grr!

"event","Ok I FINALLY got the code to change my name to something else so when I get into the mood for doing that I will email everyone and let them know!=) Ok? Well today I went to the beach ALL day long!! I have a nice tan too.=) But anyway I played like 5 games of volleyball with these guys and girls then surfed a little bit. It's funny because I have NEVER played volleyball but this guy my friend Jon and I met said if we keep practicing we could be good enough in less than 2 weeks. So maybe i'll get on the volleyball team they play on?? lol That would be tight. After I got home from the beach I went to my work to wash my car and stuff and man it was hot as hell there! Like my friends working today were throwing up and passing out. Wasn't a good day for them and tomorrow is supposed to be even hotter! Lucky me, I gotta work!!=( lol Oh well. Maggie called earlier today so i'm going to have to call her back in a few minutes. Tomorrow night were going to watch a movie together and I don't know what else. We'll find something to do.=) I can talk to maggie forever because she listens to everything I say. I finally got my ex bitch gf Stephanie off my back to. Atleast I think so?? Most of you know she's been saying stuff behind my back and it doesn't make any sense at all. I don't talk to her, bother her in any way, or do I speak of her to anyone else! I hate her for being such a backstabbing liar like her friend Tara. What a match they are. So hopefully she will keep her mouth shut for now on before she pisses a few of my gf's off. Jon Tabor can't stand her it's so funny. Like when we go to Davey's house sometimes we drive by there and he's like ""hey wolf lets see if her 21 year old loser bf is there."" He ays everything bad about her and I do my best not to say anything at all. I just laugh. I can't stop him from saying stuff anyway, it's Jon!! Jon doesn't care! lol Well i'm looking forward to a good night with Maggie tomorrow so when I change my name and everything that will be the start of a new journal entry. Ttyl!

"event","Man i'm so frusterated it's not funny! The only reason i'm saying all this stuff in my journal is because I don't feel like talking to anyone right now in person. I know it sounds mean but i'm sure most of you understand?? Well today I had Randle on my mind all day long. All I kept thinking about was the last time we surfed and the last words I said to him. I'm just real upset about the whole thing and I hope his mom is doing ok. Anyway today on my way back to Splash I smelled fuel coming from my car. At first I thought it was my exaust since most sports cars do have a slight smell like that but as I drove down the road I knew something was going wrong with my car. Everything got real hot inside so I finally pulled up to Splash after my lunch break and lifted up my hood. I see my fuel lines melted down on my header and I was pissed!! Somehow they moved down onto my header and melted all 3 lines together. My two fuel lines and my air hose. Gas was leaking everywhere!! I was thinking to myself ""geez what's next!!??"" If I kept on driving and didn't notice what was wrong with my car it would've blown up on me and I wouldn't be here right now even telling this story. I had this feeling like something was telling me to pull over quick and look and since I was almost at Splash I stopped there and I saw the problem. You all may think i'm stupid or crazy but I know where that feeling came from and i'm glad he gave me a sign before something happened. Thanks ""buddy"". Get the hint? Well that's all I have to say for a while so hopefully things will cool down for me. Later...

"event","Well things were going pretty well the past few days with work, school, and of course surfing the waves when I got the chance. Randle came into town from Orlando to see his Dad since he lives in Daytona beach and he also came to see me so we could surf together. It was Kelly's Birthday yesterday so I told him to come down and celebrate to. Saturday night I had a little party at my house and he came over for a few because he had to go back home so he could make it to work the next morning. We surfed Saturday afternoon and the waves rocked. We had a great time. Although I didn't know it would be the last time I would ever surf with a best friend. Sunday night around 6 I got a phone call from Kelly telling me Randle got into a bad accident on the way home. Lindsey his ex gf called her and told her asap so Kelly could notify me since she didn't have my number. He was rushed to the hospital Saturday night after the accident and I guess he went into a deep acoma instantly. So I drove up to the hospital not knowing anything was really wrong....All I thought was maybe he broke a few bones or something like that. I went to his room and there were A LOT of people there and everyone was taking turns going in and out and it was fianlly my turn to go in there like 10 minutes after I arrived. His mom was sitting in the chair holding his hand so I stood up next to him and put my hand on his arm. He was sleeping and his mom then told me he was in acoma so I got a little teary eyed right there when she told me that. She started crying and stuff and that made me feel horrible about the whole situation. So I looked at him with my hand on his shoulder and said ""hey man the waves are rockin we need to go surf."" I don't know if he heard me but of course there was no responce. I started to cry a little bit and Kelly walked in to try and support his mom while she was completely hysterical. A few minutes later I saw his whole body move and I thought he was having a seizure but he was actually having a stroke when we later found out. The nurses came running in and did everything they could by I saw the monitor flat line and my buddy died before my eyes. I've never had anyone die in front of me and I was in shock when it happened. I completely lost it and couldn't stop shaking. He died at 7:15 last night. You never know when things like this will happen and whenever I see the saying ""live life to your fullest"" I will do that after the experience I had and I admire that saying a lot now since it's something we all need to do. Although i'm happy I did get to surf one last time with him before he died but I don't think I can continue to surf anymore. Anytime I go out in that water on a board he will be the first thing that enters my mind and that will be hard for me to deal with knowing i'll never surf with him again. He was a good friend and i'll never forget him. I just hope that everyone realizes how much friends truly mean....

"event","The past few days have been hell for me. I've been pretty sick and caughed up a lot of blood too. Everynight I TRY to sleep I can't and today I finally got some rest! I feel much better that I slept half the day. I don't know what's wrong with me but i'm going to my doctor again sometime this week. I'm hoping that it has nothing to do with my seizures because since I have been caughing up blood its been making me wonder if I have blood leaking in my brain again or something. That would suck. Who knows though I feel a little better right now so maybe it will go away eventually. I didn't do too much last weekend except chill with Jon and be with Kelly on Friday night. Kelly and I went to her moms house and watched a movie then went back to her place and watched more movies!! haha Then I crashed at her place and the next day I went surfing. That's about the only thing exciting I did. Ever since that i've been sick so I don't have much to say. Pretty soon my cousins will be coming down from Boston,Mass. so that will be awesome. I wish Emma was coming with them though.=( Man I miss that girl! But i'll see her eventually...Right Emma? haha Muuuhh! Well i'm gonna go...peace

In order for me to change my Journal Address I have to pay so when I do that i'll let the people I want reading this know when it will happen.=) The whole spring break for me completely rocked and I wish it could start all over! I was at so many places having so much fun...Kelly's place..Robby's house partying..Travis's house partying..beachside yellin at hot chiks (haha)..Sea World..Randles in Orlando   clubbin..and so much more!! I also got a new car a few days ago but right now I have it in the shop getting new breaks. I was about to get a Ford Ranger but instead I saw this Pontiac Firebird Formula 1. It's a great looking sports car with leather interior and red on the outside. Has a 350 in it although it is an automatic. The good thing about it being an automatic is the fact that it has a shift kit in it for racing. So i'll be out there every Thursday night! haha=) It has 275 horse power at the moment but once I get my Air Intake on it in a few weeks it will have over 300 horses under the hood.=) It's going to look pretty tight once I get my new rims too because I don't like the ones on it right now.

"event","Hey! I haven't talked much in a while because I've been really busy! Last week Brianna came down from Indiana and we had a blast together. The first night she came to see me which was last Tuesday, she was so nervous! I answered the door and I said ""Hey!!"" SO I gave her a big hug and I could tell she was nervous and I said ""Are you nervous or something??"" lol So her mom was like ""Yes she's nervous she gets like that sometimes."" haha I thought it was funny because i've never seen anyone so nervous to see me. I guess her crush on me plays a role in that. So we chilled at my house the first night she was over and we had some nice talks.=) So then Thursday she wanted me to go to Sea World with her and that was fun!! We rode that coaster called Kraken and man that scared the shit out of me the first time I went on! lol I think we went on it like 4 or 5 times at the most and at the end of the ride we both got a picture to keep for memories. I saw Shamu and I think it grew a little more! That whale is HUGE and it actually splashed people on the second deck of the stands and I didn't think it was possible until I saw it jump out of the water and land on its stomach. So later on that night we wanted to finally ride the boat that drops off this huge hill since the line was fianlly gone down. I forgot the name of it though but we also got a picture of that too. We had second thoughts about going on it because we didn't want to be all wet for the car ride home, but to us it didn't look like people were really getting that wet on the way down. So I said what the hell...lets go on it! haha So much for not getting wet!! OMG I was drenched by the time we got off. After we dropped on the big hill we had no idea there was more after that and we dropped on another one that totally wasted us and man was I mad!! lol My shoes had water in them, my shorts felt like I just got out of a pool, my shirt was soaked, and I was freezing my ass off! lol Brianna got just as wet as I did so we went to the gift store to buy some clothes to change into. No I DIDN'T change in front of Brianna like most of you thought ( if u heard the story) all she did was joke about it saying I couldn't change unless it was in front of her. haha I swear she is the most blunt person I think i've ever met before and I love that! She has liked me for a while and when she wants to say something about it or flirt around she does it!! lol Most girls are scared to say they like you but NOT Brianna!! haha So the next day she came back to my house and Jon showed up with Mica (two band dorks haha) and they both met her and thought she was a really nice person with some good looks too! I think mica had a crush on her.=) But anyway! lol I told Brianna we would go to the beach one day before she goes back home so Jon and Mica said they would go also. We went to her hotel the next morning walked the beach, swam in the pool, got in the hot tub, picked up some food, and chilled out for a little while since it would be the last time I would see her for a while. So the day finally came to an end.=( I gave Brianna a hug goodbye as she looked at me with this sad but evil face! lol She was mad at me a little bit because I didn't talk to her much since Jon and Mica were there and she had every right to be. I guess I spent most of that time joking around with Jon and not saying much to her.=( But she knows i'm sorry for it and she called later that night and I told her to come back over! lol So once again we had a long talk about lots of stuff and now I feel like I can say more to her if I have a problem. Even though she's far away I will still take her advice just like Maggie. Brianna is an awesome friend and it was really hard to say goodbye to her. We had a blast together and I hope that one day we can see each other again before I move on in the world. I was pretty bummed out when she left and I still am right now because I liked hanging out with her and just having good talks and good times while it lasted! I'll write more later on about the rest of my week when I have time. Other than that I miss you Brianna and give me a call when you get a chance!!

"event","Got off work a little early today because of rain and as it started to poor on us we still had some dumb ass people pulling in to get their car washed. Now isnt that rediculous? Anyway on Tuesday I went and got a tattoo of a barbwire on my arm. It looks really good but i'm not completely done with it yet. I might get my initials or something to go along with barbwire but I haven't made up my mind. Everyone asked me if it hurt and I will admit it did when he went a little under my arm and on my tricep. Other than that it was just a weird tingle feeling that got rteal annoying. haha It took about 45 minutes to do but i'm very impatient and I couldn't wait for it to get over with. Last night my friend Tyler came over to say hey. I've known him for about 6 years now but we don't hang out as much anymore. He brought over his friend Billy who I can't stand and his friend Billy brought over this scrubby looking girl. So when they were about to leave I took Tyler to the side and said ""I don't care if you come over...but DON'T bring those nasty people around my house!"" He said they just follow him around but if that's the case then they all need to walk somewhere else and not my house. I don't like scrubby people because they remind me of my old neighbors we had a big feud with and I know most of you know about them! This weekend i'm going to look for a vehicle because I can start driving again in 6 days!! Finally!!! Now I won't have to call people for rides anymore and I can do my own thing so i'm pretty excited. I was going to get a 3000GT but I changed my mind and I think i might get a truck instead. To be honest I can't make up my damn mind about what I want. I'll take my time and look around I guess. It won't be long until I graduate, get my own apartment, and get a job with the city of Port Orange. The school year is going by so fast my mind is going crazy thinking about how everything is going to work with me once I graduate. Well I have to get ready for dinner tonight because my whole family is going out since it's a celebration for my moms birthday. She's going to be 49!! Man she's getting old!! lol j/k mom.=) Actually most of my friends thought she was like between 33 and 37 and she was shocked to hear that. So was I! lol So talk to you all soon..oh yea and email me if you want my new journal address when I change it and i'll give it to you. I only want certain people reading it. later

"event","Today is a crazy day for my mom and I. We had to take the day off from work so I could see my doctor and get more blood taken. I swear I don't think I have much blood left in my body! Anyway we also had to go to Creek to talk to my councilor about my Senior pictures and stuff like that. When the nurse took my blood today it hurt like hell and that was the first time i've ever felt pain when I've had my blood taken. They always say what nice veins I have and this time my vein didn't come out all the way like it usually does. I don't know what the reason was for that but when she stuck the needle in me my eyes got all teary and my mom knew something was up. I mean the put that needle way up in my vein! When I was done getting my blood taken she started laughing at me because about it. lol What a pain in the ass. I always say that to her.=) The other day my mom was telling me what my niece kayla said to her about my ex girl friends. Kayla told her out of all my girl friends she thinks Haley was the prettiest and the right one for me. lol I mean I totally agree with her and she also said she felt bad for me because ""uncle Jason always spends too much money on them."" lol For once the little monster said something nice and not mean! haha So now i'm home and I didn't expect to be home this early so I guess i'll go to the beach or maybe workout at the gym today. Actually that sounds better I think I will go to the gym. later...

"event","What's up? Well today I was gonna go to the beach with maggie but she woke up sick this morning.=( So I guess we'll go next weekend and chill out. I'm really tired at the moment so i don't know if i'll do anything today. Anyway Thursday night I went street racing with Ryan, Jon, and Brian and it was pretty tight. I saw A LOT of people I knew in middle schoool I haven't seen in a while and made some plans with a few of them to go out sometime. Everyone met up at the Home Depot to show off their cars and stuff then we all moved by Municipal stadium to race. Ryan was the ONLY one who raced twice out there and he did pretty good except for missing that 3rd gear. haha After he raced a 5.0 like his car he turned around to come back and he pulled into park it for a few minutes. As soon as he pulled in we all see a cop come down the road with his lights off then he turned on his flashers and OMG i've never seen so many people scramble and take off before. There were atleast 50 cars out there and when the cop came 7 of us jumped in this kid Brandons blazer and we hauled ass! It was pretty scary because i've never been caught by the cops when I go street racing with Teri but this time they showed up and I was just crossing my fingers hopeing we would get away and we did. So Thursday night was pretty exciting but it wasn't as good as Friday night!! I went on a date with Lindsey that Randle TRIED to hook me up with and I had a lot of fun. This girl was really good looking but she was the biggest snob i've ever met. lol SO much for my luck because i'm not into those types of girls. I dated a couple like that and learned my lesson.=) She did like me though and I kissed her to say goodnight to let her know I did have a goodtime but she doesn't know it will be the last one she will get from me. lol Man i'm mean.=) I was gonna bring her to Ryans party after the date but she didn't want to go because she didn't know anyone there but we had fun at Fuel and it was the second time i've ever been to a club. I'm not much of a clubber because I hate dancing fast. haha A lot more happened with the date but if I keep talking about it this entry will be really long! I do have to say I LOVE bing single right now!! I can go from one girl to the next and not worry about anything. Yea know? It's not like i'm using girls either so don't get the wrong impression on me. I'm just having fun and looking around for a sweet girl to be with.=) I came home after the date and then Ryan picked me up to go get the hotel room at the Ramada Inn. Ryan paid for the hotel and I payed for beer and also a security deposit of 50 dollars incase there was damage but I got it all back the next morning because there was no damage at all. Brian Mincey brought this stuff called Bicardi and mixed it with fruit punch and I got a case of budweiser. We had some spring breakers next to us and we invited them to come over and they were really cool people. SO we all drank together and had a lot of fun. They told Brian and I we could come back anytime to chill with them so we went there last night to talk but we didn't drink or anything like that. Yuck! I don't even want to think about beer right now. Everytime I go to a party I try not to drink too much and I ALWAYS do and I was even more messed up because the beer mixed with my pills and I totally forgot about that. Other than that the party went real smooth and if I throw one in a couple weeks hopefully it will go smooth too. Well now that maggie can't go to the beach I guess i'll find someone else to go with. Hope you feel better Maggie!=) Well i'm tired of typing now so i'm gonna go. By the way if anyone knows who Sexychik96 is let me know. She says she goes to Creek but won't tell me her name or anything. Man do I hate that when people IM me! Ttyl"

"event","Maggie Nolan has to be one of the sweetest girls I have ever met in my entire life! She is always there for me when I need someone to talk to and I love her for that. She called me like a hundred times this past week and I never got in touch with her because I've been out everynight and I've been at work everyday so I finally called her back and we had a very nice conversation. Well it's like that all the time actually. haha But we were talking about prom and I told her I wasn't sure if I was going or not because I still had to find a date and she's like ""Jason! I WIll be your date!!"" lol I guess I do have to admit I like Maggie a little bit but I don't want her to get the wrong impression about me. Were good friends and I want it to always be that way and not let my feelings go too far. Know what I mean? So I told her if I don't go to prom I would let her know and if I wanted to go but didn't have a date yet I would keep her in mind.=) She's such a nice person. When I was in the hospital and she came to visit me I knew from there we would always be close so I guess I do have someone to lean on!!=) haha Well that's all i'm saying for now but I have A LOT to say about Thursday night and last night so i'll write later on. It was crazy!!

"event","Well I have a little problem and I have to make a decision soon! I like kelly a lot now ever since we started talking and I feel she would be real fun to be with. Lindsey on the other hand I don't really know well but I have a date with her Friday night. Kelly knows i'm going on this date and I don't want to make her jealous or anything like that. Know what I mean?? SO I don't know what to do right now because I do like Kelly more. Maybe i'll go on the date and see what she's like and hopefully kelly will go with the flow. SO if anyone has advice let me know! I'll write more later.

"event","Ok first i'm going to start off with something i'm really mad about!! I went to the mall a couple weeks ago and bought a new bathing suit. So I went to the beach yesterday after work for like 2 hours just so surf the waves a little with Randle since he's here for spring break. So I wash it last night and I wake up this morning to hang it up on the line and OMG the thing shrunk so small I don't even think my niece could fit in them! I'm so pissed and it was Hurley swimwear that cost me $50 dollars now it's down the drain. I tried to return it but I threw the receipt away when I bought it so they won't take it back. So much for my luck!! lol So now I gotta buy a another one this weekend. I learned a very important lesson though....to SAVE my receipts! But oh well I have a good job so it won't hurt to buy another one I guess.=) So far I have everything planned out for my future and i'm excited about it. I'm going to spend 2 years at DBCC for my AA then spend the remainder of my years at a university but I don't know which one yet. haha SO after I graduate i'm quitting Splash carwash and getting a full time job with the city of Port Orange where my dad works. I'll be making good money there so I will get to rent my own apartment and if I get a roomate it will be even better! Most likely I will so I have more money left over. I'm looking at a car right now and it's a 3000 GT for sale so if my doctor approves of my driving this weekend I might get it. If not then i'll just have to wait longer to drive!! lol It doesn't really matter to me anyway just gives me more time to save my money up for a better car. If I didn't switch medication I would be driving by now!!=( Well that's all I have to say for now so i'll speak later on...peace

"event","What's up guys!? Well i'm bored right now and since I have a few things to say i figured iw ould type. Friday night is goingt o be a big night for me. I have a date with this girl Lindsey that my friend Randle is trying to hook me up with. I talked to her online a few times and i sent her a picture of me and she did the same. This girl is very beautiful. I don't really know much about the inside but the thing about her is she went through the same break up I did with my ex girl friend Haley. Pretty strange huh? So Friday were gonna go see a movie then I might bring her to Ryan Gaineys birthday party at the hotel. But i'm really sure I will because she doesn't know any of them and plus she's just now getting to know me! lol So hopefully everything will go smooth Friday night. I gotta go real quick because kelly just pulled up so i'll talk to you all later!!

"event","I had an awesome week when the bikers were here. I went up to Main Street 3 times with Kelly and her friends the first night, Davey, Jon, and Katie the second night then Brian and Mike the 3rd night. lol I had lots of fun! When I was with Kelly she was wearing a thong with white pants on and she told me to wear tight blue jeans and Kelly had almost every guy there telling her to flash them. lol She didn't do it and I was proud of that but all I know is that i'll NEVER wear tight pants again! It was so uncomfortable! I don't know why she wanted me to do that but I regret it. haha But anyway there were a lot of cool bikes down there and BIG trucks all jacked up on 44 inch tires. Next year i'll have my own motorcycle when I get my job at the city then I won't have to walk around. I think i've walked over 20 miles this week. lol Besides all of that i've been pretty busy working at Splash, school work, and working out. I'm supposed to have school tomorrow but my teacher has to go to Deland to give an F-Cat test to one of his students. SO i don't have school until Thursday! The only bad part is I have to work tomorrow since I have no school. lol=( Oh well i'll have a nice paycheck.=) I didn't go to sleep last night until like 4 in the morning because I was partying with some buddies so right now i'm really tired and I think i'll go to bed! It's nice to be healthy again!! I will say that over and over! I mean I went through hell with my health problems and i'm really excited that I can party like I use to and do other things. I've come a LONG way and so far i'm on track again.=) Well i'm going to bed so i'll talk later!

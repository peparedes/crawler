You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free. You have a tendency to like those who have a split personality - cold as ice on the outside but hot as fire in the heart.

In love, you feel the most alive when things are straight-forward, and you're told that you're loved.

You'd like to your lover to think you are stylish and alluring.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was emotional, moody, and difficult to please OR someone who was arrogant, acting like the dictator of your life.

Your ideal relationship is open. Both of you can talk about everything... no secrets. You also like a relationship that is comforting. You crave a relationship where you always feel warmth and love.


Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about love and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage as something precious. You'll treasure marriage and treat it as sacred.

In this moment, you think of love as something you thirst for. You'll do anything for love, but you won't fall for it easily.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>


""You would be forced to break up with someone who was emotional, moody, and difficult to please."" ... funny, that's the discription of Ben to a T.

You are a very open minded person, but you're also well grounded.
Tolerant and flexible, you appreciate most lifestyles and viewpoints.
But you also know where you stand firm, and you can draw that line.
You're open to considering every possibility - but in the end, you stand true to yourself.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howopenmindedareyouquiz/"">How Open Minded Are You?</a></div>

Loyalty:

You value loyalty highly.
You're completely devoted to your friends and family.
Even if they totally screw up, you're still there for them.
Just make sure they're equally loyal to you!

Honesty:

You value honesty a fair amount.
You're honest when you can be, but you aren't a stickler for it.
If a little white lie will make a situation more comfortable, you'll go for it.
In the end, you mostly care about ""situational integrity.""

Generosity:

You value generosity highly.
So much so that you often put your own needs last.
There's nothing wrong with having a caring heart...
But you may want to rethink your ""open wallet"" policy.

Humility:

You value humility a fair amount.
You tend to be an easy going, humble person.
But occasionally your ego takes over.
You have a slight competitive streak - and the need to be the best.

Tolerance: 

You value tolerance highly.
Not only do you enjoy the company of those very different from you...
You do all that you can to seek it out interesting and unique friends.
You think there are many truths in life, and you're open to many of them.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivefactorvaluestest/"">The Five Factor Values Test</a></div>"

( This one I wrote a while back when I was confused with life)
*Thoughts*  ~free verse
Sometimes I wouldn't care if I didn't wake up in the morning
Sometimes I don't care how bad my hair looks or if my clothes go together just right
Sometimes I don't care if I'm alone all day, or if I don't want to talk to anyone
Sometimes I don't care what people think when I act a certain way
Sometimes I wish they would all go away
Sometimes I wish I would go away too
Sometimes I wish I was someone else
Sometimes I wish I could look in the mirror and not recognize the face
Sometimes I hope tomorrow will be better
Sometimes I wonder if the grass is really greener on the other side
Sometimes I wonder if I'm really sane
Sometimes I wonder why, already knowing the response
Sometimes...

(This is one I wrote for someone when he wasn't feeling at his best because of what someone said)
*All That Should Matter*
Why do they get to you so easily?
Don't you even listen to me?
You're so beautiful within my eyes
So why bother with their stupid lies?
They don't know you like I do.
You're full of so much care and passion, I truly love you.
You think you're not good enough, well what about me?
I hate myself all the time, but you never see.
They hurt me and scar me too.
Probably worse then they ever did to you.
I forget it, and leave it behind.
But you let it stay in your mind.
You tell me to leave things alone, to just drop it.
So why do you get worked up over stupid sh*t?
I love you, that's all that should matter.

(This one I wrote for a special someone.. you know who you are. ~.^)
*A Thousand Tears and A Thousand Deaths*
I would cry a thousand tears, only just for you.
If it would make you happy, it's something I would do.
I'd do anything for your happiness, love and care.
I'd let you lock me up forever, you wouldn't have to share.
I'd die a thousand times for you, and then a thousand more.
To keep your heart from breaking and from ever being tore.
But there's one thing I couldn't do, you see.
I'd never let you die a day before me.
A thousand tears and a thousand deaths are nothing to compare.
The pain that I would endure if you weren't always there.
So by the grace of God, I hope he takes me first.
Because just one day without you is ultimately worse.
A thousand tears and a thousand deaths I'd relive a thousand times.
Just to make you happy and to always see you smile.


That's all for now. Later. <3"

"event","Sorry I haven't posted in a while. I just got home from the mall. Seen the movie Hitch. I greatly approve of couples or helpless guys seeing it with someone they wanna get with. I've gotta lot to talk about, but I don't wanna spend all night on here gabbin away. Lol. 
Josh is with Jeremy in Chicago. They're usually together about 85% of the time. I'm cool with it since they're cousins. It's just.. I didn't know it was a 2 for 1 special when I said yes to Josh. But I guess alone time isn't important unless... well, I won't go there. It's just kind of hard to stay afloat with too many on the raft. (Most won't get the metaphor. Don't feel bad. It's understandable. Those who do... congratulations.) Anyway, I'm feeling alright tonight. Had a weird dream though. About Josh.. he kept wanting to kiss me.. and it felt so uncomfortable. Mostly because we were in public, and it was the kinda of things you do in the privacy of your own home. Of course it got me thinking, and I found out exactly what it meant, but I won't explain it out. Most of you probably don't care and have already stopped reading. Work was easy. I love Sean. He's so nice to me. Probably the best manager I have except Lil Bit and Kim. And Ishmael too, he's pretty cool. I'm suppose to be cleaning my room, but that doesn't look like it's happening. Not alotta people online either. Devan's the only one talking to me right now. 

I'll end with some advice I've learned today:
If men were women for a day, they'd never leave the house.
Peel the piece off the cappuccino lid before putting it on the cup.
It's better to under estimate the night then over.
White teeth do make a difference.
Don't miss him, anticipate his return.
You're only as fat as you think.
Lingerie does serve a purpose besides floor decoration.
Don't hate her for not being around, hate her for not understanding why she should stay.
Don't live your life by how many breaths you take, but by the moments that take your breath away.

That's it for me. Love to you all. You know who you are. ~.^ Sweet dreams."

"event","Well, I'm beginning to think that I shouldn't believe her when she promises me. It always falls through one way or another. But I always strive for that ""Maybe"".. but it never works. I don't want to give up on her.. but she's kinda given up on me.. Is that even morally acceptable? For her to give up on me? Maybe.. There's that word again. Maybe.. maybe is one of those words that's never certain, but it keeps people like me hanging on. I hate who ever came up with the word...

Right now I feel alone and let down. If it wasn't for my emo music, I seriously would lose my mind about right now. I'm so pathetic.. Look at me. Complaining and just asking for a pity party. It's really not my style. Have I sunk this low? Is it really my fault it's come to this? I'd have to say.. not fully. I could always just look on the bright side of it, but what's the point? I do it all the time, why not have a moment to NOT look on the good side.. I use to never get to the good side.. so why not visit the bad side for the evening? Since I'm crushed, let down, and most of all... my trust for her words grow smaller each time I hear them.. Too bad.

I don't want to put this all on Josh. He's too good for that. He doesn't need to support my weakness. Sometimes I think he puts up with a lot of $#!+ that goes on that he shouldn't have to that's my fault. Sometimes I wonder if he knows he's too good for me.. I bet not. Maybe if he reads this, he'll know why I want to grow up and leave.. he'll know why I try to have 5 more minutes.. or even just one more. =( 

I never like to let someone down as much as I've been let down.. it's hurts too much. Maybe one day she'll understand that. Maybe she'll grow up. Maybe she'll understand why I cry.. and why I avoid it when I can. But there's that word again... Maybe. And still.. I'm holding on.

"event","Sorry I haven't written in a while, I've been busy with work and other things. I've been on kinda a diet. I know, I know.. you're either on one or you're not. But the good news is, from when I started the diet till now, I've lost like 8 pounds.. which blows my mind.. I only started it this week. And no, I don't starve myself and no... I'm not spending my money on weight loss foods that look like dirt. xP I'm just eating better and keeping myself going. But I seriously need this. For myself and other people. I mean, why should someone hang around me, when I don't even care what I look like, and how people look at me, you know? It just makes me feel ten times worse then I already do about myself. But if I can feel more comfortable with the way I look, I know I'll be a better to hang around. I don't wanna be super skinny, but I just don't want to be so ""thick"". Lol. Bonna knows what I'm talkin about. ~.^ Anyway, I'll get going. Need some sleep from today, since I worked 9am to 430pm and then went straight to a bday party. x-x; Later. <3

(P.S. FYI I have no clue what so ever why my page looks so fricken cute and fluffy.. I just tried to make things match, and now that I look at it, it scares me. It's like I'm stuck in girly mode. x-x; And I'm not that girly. Not cutesy girly.. just kinda plain girl. XD I dunno it's late. <3 )"

"event","<P>I was just looking back on my old LJ Vurtured_heart or w/e. I really miss the good times I had on here. I hope more people will realize I'm back here and I'm stayin'. Also, ya'll can delete the other name from your friend's list. I realized you can't delete names on here, so I didn't even try to. Anyway, I just wanted to shout out to all my friends I hardly get to talk to:</P>
<P>Liz, I'm shoutin' out to you even if we talk. You've been there for me, and I hope we get back into touch like we use to. Luff yewh. &lt;3</P>
<P>Wes, man, I rarely ever see you anymore, I miss the deep intellectual talks we use to have (right lol). Miss ya fruitcake.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Eric, You're still my GA. Sorry things haven't been going smooth with our friendship. Guess our lives are too busy to allow too much chit-chat, eh? ~.^</P>
<P>Jess, We're probably the worst off. I don't think we ever really talk anymore, but like I said with Eric, the time seems to slip from me. Sorry for not bein there, hun. &lt;3</P>
<P>Ross, I know you've probably got a good life goin' for ya without me in it, but I kinda wonder whatcha up to sometimes. I miss having a sarcastically mean friend. You're one of a kind. ~.^</P>

Ashley, You're the craziest freshman I think I know. Don't lose that smile either. ^.~ Hope highschool is a blast, girl. <33

<P>That's all I can think of for now. Oh, quick update, 2 more days and it'll be a year me and Josh have been together! Isn't that crazy? I'm just surprized he hasn't gone off the deep end by now. Lol. He's a great guy and I love him a lot. Even if he trusts the weatherman, and he thinks he can beat me at DDR. =D Love ya, sweets. I better get going since it's like 9:13am. I've actually been up since 5 but I got on here around 7:30am since I was dozing off for about for about 2 hours, I decided to just get up and find something to do. I needa shower. Lol. Not really bad, but I'm kinda hungry so I might go eat something. I was hoping Steven would take me to get breakfast, but he already left to eat with his girlfriend Holly and came back here to get movies and leave. =( I really was looking forward to pancakes and a cinnimon roll. Lol. Oh.. I had a weird dream last night, if I could only remember what happened.. =/&nbsp; I feel like writing a poem.. it might end up being nonsense but that's okay. =d</P>
<P><STRONG><U><FONT color=#ffffff>Dreamwanderer</FONT></U></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My eyes are coated in stardust from sleep,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>But they ache a painful feeling from all that&nbsp;I weep.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I toss and turn in the empty bed,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Half asleep is&nbsp;my drowzy head.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My vision is blurred,&nbsp; I&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;slept,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>But my mind won't let me, so awake I am&nbsp;kept.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Hours upon hours I spend staring into space,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>My eyes try to piece together the memory of your face.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Maybe it would calm me, so I could finally rest.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>But alas, it has failed, I tried my very best.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>So I arose from the bed, dazed and swaying,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Then from the background, I heard music playing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I headed towards the sound as it grew more,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I peeked around the corner, after opening the door.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>And there you sat, as you've been there all along,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Waiting for me, and playing&nbsp;our song.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I smiled and moved to fall into your embrace,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I no longer had to imagine your sweet face.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>For there you were, right in front of me,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>But what is this? It was all just a dream?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I had fallen asleep once and for all..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I never really journeyed into the hall.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Your face wasn't there just my bare ceiling tiles,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>And I couldn't believe that it was a dream&nbsp;all in the whiles.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>It was just a dream, and nothing more,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I never found you behind the door.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Maybe I've gone crazy, or insane I could be..</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I can't separate the dreams from&nbsp;my own&nbsp;reality.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>As the dawn finally settles in, I sigh a heavy sigh,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>That seeing you in that room was all a lie.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>I suppose it means you wander in&nbsp;my dreams,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Confusing me&nbsp;as it's&nbsp;not what it seems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Don't leave me Dreamwanderer, don't let me disremember.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffffff>Till we meet again in dreamland, when I sleep a peaceful slumber.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Welp, sorry for that long story type poem. Lol.. Kinda odd but I like it. Anyway, more people are starting to come online, so I'm going to go find something to eat. Hopefully Josh wakes up soon. -.-; Baies &amp; Smoochies. &lt;333</FONT></P>

"event","I swear I've gone through a box of tissues alone today... Maybe it's God's way of telling me to slow down and stop trying to save the world. Lol. Not literally. xD But you know what I mean. I really miss Josh. He has to work 7 hours today, which sucks because he didn't seem to want to go. =/ I don't know what to do with him anymore. Anything I do, I mess it up. Whether it be us sitting there and being fine, and then I have to bring something up, or it's just he's not having a good day. I'm hoping things settle down in my relationship area.. because I don't think I can handle anymore drama in my life. =d But anyhoo, I'm talking to Ben. He's on his ""mobile device"". Lol.. I'm trying to figure out what to do next.. Play DDR, take a shower, listen to music more, paint my toe nails, call my mom.. I know.. I'll call my mom first, then play DDR, then listen to music WHILE painting my toe nails. xD I'm so ingenious. So I'll get going on that. Smoochies. <3"

"event","Hey everyone. I haven't posted in here so long, that my old username has been taken off. Lol. I'm glad to be back, hopefully all my friends will add me, and I'll get back into the mix of everything happening again. Christmas is in 11 days and I'm really not prepared for it. I haven't even written a list if that tells you anything. I'm sorry, but I have to make this short since it's a little past 10, and I need to get some sleep for tomorrow. Finals for school are coming up. I'm not ready for those either. So I'll post some other time. Thanks for having me back everyone. <333 Smoochies.

P.S.
The website labeled ""Twilight"" at the top is my other Journal. Check it out sometime. =D"

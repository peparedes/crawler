[1] A Bittorrent Client, and
[2] The required codecs/filters/etc to play the files you've downloaded.

1. Bittirrent Clients. 
Here is a link to the original:
http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html

And here are several others:
http://bittornado.com/
http://azureus.sourceforge.net/
http://pingpong-abc.sourceforge.net/
http://krypt.dyndns.org:81/torrent/index.phtml
http://www.torrentstorm.com/
[For MAC OS X]: http://sarwat.net/bittorrent/

- If your the type to leave things running overnight and don't really find much need to ""pause"" your downloads, then just use the original one:
http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html
- Else, if you find yourself downloading far too many Bittorrents then you should and therefore sometimes have to pause things to get your bandwidth back (i.e. your greedy), then use:
http://bittornado.com/
[Its got faster ""resume"" facilities.]

2. Play the stuff you've downloaded.

First off, most of what you've downloaded (.avi files) will require the DivX codec. Get it here:
http://www.divx.com/divx/?src=footer_divx_from_/software/index.php

Occasionally, something you've downloaded also won't have any audio playing. You probably need an AC3 filter. Here is one:
http://ac3filter.sourceforge.net/

And sometimes, the file format will not be .avi - e.g. .mkv and .ogm files. To watch these, get the ""Matroska Pack Full v1.0.2"" from:
http://packs.matroska.org/
[When you install this, make sure you check the MMswitcher option; it is not checked by default, and you need this to play on your Media Player 9.]

This should allow you to play .mkv and .ogm files. 

If you still have problems, then try using the classic media player, which you can get here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/guliverkli

- You'll still need a Matroska Pack (for .mkv files) from:
http://packs.matroska.org/

- And maybe for .ogm files, the Ogg DirectShow Filter:

- and, Subtitle Filter
http://tobias.everwicked.com/subtit.htm


Hope this helps you all with your Bittorrent needs ..."

"event","Okay, so whats happened recently?<br /><br />Um, missed most of last week of school, since Dave passed away and me and mah parentals went down south to attend the funeral among other things. <br />Also missed my Goethe exam, thats five bucks down the drain. Also missed bio test. Yay.<br /><br />I have an ulcer in my mouth right now. In the left-hand corner. Yes, my mouth has corners.<br />And yes, its sore.<br />Its 'cos I bit it about 3 times on friday.<br />Which incidentally was the ball.<br />I still don't get why people go on and on about it.<br />I mean, I went, and this was my impression:<br />Go to the thing, exchange 'pleasantries' about how 'nice' everyone looks, and then either shout at each other 'cos the music's too loud to talk, eat food, or dance for the rest of the night. Take your pick. Oh, and if you're super lucky, you can take photos!<br />Yep. I mean, you can do that at a private party, get dressed up if you want, and you can choose who you want to attend, so you don't have to deal with any arseholes or idiots if you don't want. <br />And you can choose music. <br />I mean, seriously, they only played <strong>one</strong> rock song the whole time! Just one!<br />And it was Enter Sandman by Metallica. A good song, granted, but there are so many other good ones around!<br />But no, there were a bunch of morons there who kept shouting 'Hip Hop, Hip Hop!'<br />.......So we got some Hip Hop.<br />Hmm. <br />But yes, I don't get what all the 'hype' was about.<br /><br />Why did I go again?"

"event","Is it just me, or does everyone feel like their heads are so crammed full of useless names, words, and other junky information that aforementioned head is ready to explode?<br />I mean, seriously, I was looking over some notes before and thinking about how much junk I've written down this year, and how much of it I've remembered, how much of it I actually use, and the answer is:<br /><br />Fuck all.<br /><br />Thats right folks, I don't see the point. Now, everyone probably goes through this, hell, they probably go through this quite often, and I hate to jump on the bandwagon and start repeating whats already been said millions of times, but it seems pretty unavoidable, so I'm just going to come out and say it anyway...<br /><br />I'm sick of it!<br /><br />Absolutely sick of everything! I don't know whats got me in such a mood, or what I'm even ranting about anymore, but I'm <strong>sick of it</strong>!!!<br /><br />I have a bunch of completely pointless work to do, and I don't want to. Why? Let me have my silly little tantrum. I'm quite aware of what I'm doing, and just how pathetic it is, but right now, <em>because</em> I'm having a pathetic little tantrum, I don't care. I mean, seriously, I don't even really know what I'm supposed to be doing. Is that like some kind of trend this year, huh? Tell the students they have to do something, give them a hint or so, and see just how much they can mess it up with minimal interference? <br /><br />Grrr. And anything they <strong>do </strong>tell us is stuff they've already said, or stuff that we don't need to know, or they'll ignore it, pretend they don't know what we're on about and then blame us when me do it all wrong.<br /><br />Yes, its probably our fault. Don't say I can't take responsibility for my actions, because I bloody well do. I beat myself up for my mistakes, but I wont do it in public, where everyone can witness it. Being or doing something wrong doesn't automatically make me a complete fool. No, not quite.<br /><br />Well, I'm running out of steam for this sad little vent. I rather think its a shame I can't stay mad for so long. But that takes energy, and I need to save all of mine for something more productive. See, I <strong>can</strong> think ahead, and do something helpful/useful! I just often choose not to!<br /><br />And now I think I shall go and flounder around some more in my sea of strange words and wasteful ideas. <br /><br />Laters, yo!"

"event","Again, I have been remiss in my updates.<br /><br />So here goes:<br /><br />I passed my trig practical thingee with excellence, as if anyone actually <em>cares</em>, but thats okay, because the point is that now its OVER the next thing on my 'worry' list is the prelim exams in weeks 4-5, which, while they aren't the real deal, <em>are</em> still important if I don't want all my teachers getting on my back for not passing. Not that they expect to have to do that, although my bio teacher would probably like to.....<br /><br />Oops, I've gone off on a tangent. Again. Oh well!<br />Did my german conversation today, and although I didn't pass (didn't use any structures) because I didn't prepare (it was only a practise), my teacher said I've got good conversatory skills, since I managed to keep the ball rolling as it were. <br /><br />I can just hear Phoebe saying 'Look at it go! That ball is so ambitious, its rolling away!' or something like that anyway. Shes a pretty funny person, actually.<br /><br />Again, I got yet <em>another</em> bunch of new songs, mainly ones by Orgy, got a few songs that have Chester Bennington in them too, and um....some Panic! at the Disco. Yay for me. <br /><br />Read another good story today, Shades of Grey on ff.net by Ageless Drake. The plot was okay, but mostly I just liked the feeling of the story as I was reading it, if anyone gets what I mean by that, and the characterisation of Wufei was tres excellent. Yes, I liked the mood and style of the story. <br /><br />Alex brought some skiis to school yesterday. And no, it does not snow in Auckland. Okay, I think it did once, on record. Point is, its autumn at the moment, Alex is strange, there was no snow, just a little grass/mud bank at the back of B-Block in school. Oh and of course, Alex, Rhubarb and some random year 7 from the school next door sliding down the hill on them. Then at lunch Rhubarb went down the <strong>stairs</strong> on them. Interesting.<br /><br />Anyway, time to go. <br /><br />Until next time."

"event","Haven't updated in a while, I know, my bad.
Oh well.

Ummers, I found a few cool new songs, and decided I really like some old ones.
I survived my Trigonometry assessment, passed my chem theory thingee with 'flying colours' I guess you could say, I did my chem practical and hopefully didn't mess it up. I finished my 12905 unit standard for english, and handed in my Creative Writing assessment. I also finished my biology internal on 'the rocky shore' and hopefully passed that as well. 

This I did all on my last day. Yesterday. 

Thats right people, its the holidays as of today. Two whole weeks in which I cannot laze around, as much as I would like to, because there are things to be done. Ah well, I can dream.

Found an awesome website, askaninja.com.
Go look at it. Its awesome. 

Went fishing today. Caught some snapper. Had a yummy dinner. Crumbed snapper and Dukkah.
Dukkah is really yummy. 

Got my Kila album. Can cross it off my never-ending list of 'Music-I-Must-Get'.
Yay. 

That about covers it I think. 

Until next time then."

"event","Okay, so on Sunday I got up niiice and early to go fishing with the parentals. Yay. At least we caught some snapper, so we had some for dinner last night and tonight. Yummy.<br /><br />Hmmm, I haven't said it yet? Well here, let me say it: today was very boring. There.<br /><br />
<div text=""I was sleepy for most of the day,..."" class=""ljcut"">I was sleepy for most of the day, 'cos of the whole daylight savings change-over thing, and I tried to go to sleep in German this morning when Sheena was late to arrive. Unfortunately, she DID show up, despite my wishes otherwise. Its not that I don't like her, I just didn't feel like doing any work. Chemistry was a little better after that, because we are learning about Titration for an achievement standard we're going to be doing next week. The fun bit was that we got to work in groups, and use the burettes and pipettes. And they have such funky names too! <br /> <br />Morning tea was mostly boring, I don't actually remember much of it. As I said, today was pretty much a nothing day. <br /> <br />After that, I had English, where we mostly just watched bits and pieces of the movie 'In My Father's Den' by Brad McGann, the movie's well made, and I guess it's quite good, but it's just not down my alley of 'movie choices'. Soooo I kind of tuned it out. We're only watching it to note the differences between it and the book, by Maurice Gee, and since I watched the movie last year, also in English, it wasn't exactly necessary for me to watch it and actually make sense of any of the things I was seeing. As I said, I zoned. After that we had Biology, and we were looking at succession in ecosystems, in bits of mouldy/bacterialised bread in groups. One of the group's pieces of bread was nicely decomposing with the bacterial variety, and they wanted to see what it would smell like, so the morons decided to open the petri dish. The result was a nice mess, and the teacher's warning that if we got sore throats, to go to the doctor immediately, incase we were coming down with Strep Throat, because apparently that yellow bacteria in the dish was streptococcus. Oh joy. <br /> <br />After lunch (also very uneventful) I had maths. Doing excercises on radians and arcs etc. Not very interesting for me. Especially not today. At least I got to relax when I got home. <br /></div>
<br /><u>Points of Interest (sort of) for the day:</u><br /><br />Herbie finally bought his tin whistle to school. It was AWESOME! - now I need to get one.<br /><br />Guy, Ash and all the others made yet ANOTHER mess in Chemistry.<br /><br />Herbie can't play his tin whistle. <br /><br />Rhubarb made a point of [kinda] stalking me on the way home from school. Says hes going to do it for the rest of the year, just to annoy me.<br /><br />Lucky me.<br /><br />Now I'm tired and ready for bed, if only my head would stop thinking.<br /><br /><br />Goodnight all."

"event","<br />Okay, so there weren't actually any fields in sight, but thats what Linda (the teacher) wanted to call it, so call it that we did.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that I never <em>wanted</em> to take biology, and you might just understand my apparent lack of enthusiasm for said subject. After all, <em>I</em> wanted to do physics. But <strong>no</strong>, the school had to muck up the timetable, and now they have to have TWO biology classes, because a bunch of people also wanted to do physics but couldn't cos the timetable was screwed and they wanted to take at least one science, which ended up being biology, and the physics class is now not only ridiculously small, its ALSO got not a SINGLE female in it. Sexist bastards.<br /><br />I know, that doesn't really make sense, and I shouldn't be blaming them, but I don't care. Its <em>my</em> story, after all.<br /><br />
<div text=""the trip, and the rest of the day..."" class=""ljcut"">Took the bus up to the Arataki Visitor's Centre, up in the Waitakere Ranges, since we're doing this nifty (okay, so its actually boring) study on ecosystems and the effects of human interference on the environment. Or something else equally long-winded and boring/smart sounding like that. <br /> <br />...Anyway, we went around the visitor's centre, took a bunch of notes on the changes and stuff made to the ranges, and then we went downstairs to the 'lecture' room and watched this movie about the ranges themselves, which was mostly okay, except that the speakers in there were shit, and kept being kinda distorted by the horrible background music. I was sitting next to Rhubarb, and sort of next to Jono. Rhubarb tried to write on my arm. <br /> <br />Then we went walkies, which wasn't really much fun, there were loads of wasps floating around, and we had to do a stratification diagram, which involved drawing. Me + Drawing = Not Good. <br />Buuutt, I couldn't really get out of it, so Phibz and I did that, all the while complaining about how vague and imprecise the things actually are. I think we've been spoilt with chemistry, where everything has to be exact and shit, for the 'experiment' or whatever we're actually doing to be accurate. <br /> <br />Then afterwards, we were looking forward to getting back to school and going home, when we found out that we'd arrived near the end of lunchtime, and that we actually had to ATTEND 5th/last period. Grr. <br /> <br />So lunch ended and Tessa, Emma and I didn't want to go to our last class, which was fucking biology. AGAIN! More!!! <br /> <br />So we procrastinated. Of course. Tessa mentioned something about being one with nature, so I embraced that with the usual enthusiasm of mine, and embraced the nearest tree. And hung on. For dear life. Then Tessa started chanting in the background ""Think like the tree, breathe like the tree, feel like the tree, bark like the tree, embrace the tree, BE the tree..."" <br /> <br />Well, needless to say that, coupled with my insistence that I was now part of the tree, and was thus not going anywhere, we got some pretty weird looks. But we didn't mind. Oh no, of course not. <br /> <br />Finally we made it to class, and sat down, and did nothing. For a whole hour. Rhubarb started making those stupid paper 'fortune teller' things, gave it a face, put on a funny voice, and proceeded to terrorise Phibz with it. I was still insisting that I was a tree, and Tessa wanted a syringe, so she could take a blood test. Everyone else was just...there. Somewhere. <br /> <br />Bell went, and off WE went, home. <br /> <br />FINALLY.</div>
<br /><br />For those of you who cannot be bothered reading about my dreadfully boring/strange day at school, I will leave you with a short little 'story' Tessa came up with during biology last period today;<br /><br />*picture someone saying this kinda drunkenly/slowly/humourously*<br /><br />...No, I wouldn't go and do that to them, giving them all those 5cent coins...<br /><br />...I'd walk up to McDonalds and ask them what they had for $1.95...<br /><br />...The lady at the checkout would be like, 'I'm sorry, but I can't serve you anything""...<br /><br />...And I'd be like, ""Why not? Is it because of this horn in the middle of my forehead?""...<br /><br />...And the lady would be like, ""Yes, I'm afraid it is.""...<br /><br />...And I'd be like, ""Well its not my fault! I can't help the fact that I was born a unicorn!""<br /><br /><blockquote>I know, dreadfully lame, but it was hilarious at the time...the strange things my friend says sometimes....</blockquote>"

"event","hmm. <br /><br /><strong>[BEWARE: DISTURBED (KINDA) CONTENT COURTESY OF MY OVERACTIVE AND BIZARRE IMAGINATION. SORT OF.]</strong><br /><br />
<div text=""read warning above for warnings"" class=""ljcut"">So I wrote this story-ish thing that was kinda based around what I thought would be my reaction if this dude I <strong>really </strong> hate at school just up and died on me. Well, not actually ON me, but, well y'know...<br /><br />Anyway, basically what happened was I was just extremely pissed off, and went into this ranty thing about how unjust it was, and in my all-too-vivid imagination what I said went something like this:<br /><br />""That stupid evil fuckin bastard [insert myriad other appropriate/inappropriate profanities here]!!! <em><strong>I</strong></em> was supposed to kill the bastard! <strong><em>ME</em></strong>!!! Not some stupid inanimate moving piece of junk metal!! I've been cheated! Cheated I tell you! All those classes putting up with his huge empty head for nothing! NOTHING!!""<br /><br />So I may have been a bit harsh. That was the bit after I had found out he was dead. I'm not very nice, am I?<br /><br />No, no need to answer that. I know. And really, what has that evil asshole ever done to me anyway, that I would happily go dance on his grave, when he dies? <br /><br />The answer is nothing. Hes stupid and annoying, and tries to be all 'gangsta' and stuff, but I guess hes harmless in the long run. Or at least, mostly harmless. <br /><br />But no, something about him just REALLY rubs me the wrong way. Just the mere sight of him makes me start to feel homicidal. Towards him. Poor dude. But really, I have to put up with him in 3 of my 5 classes this year. How is that fair? How the hell did he get into the top/full streamed maths class??? I just saw him sitting there at the front of the class today, and had to wonder how the hell he managed to get there. <br /><br />The thought was soon followed by 'Help me phibz, I wanna kill him!'<br /><br />Yes, so I have problems. I hate him. Argh. I need to stop this train of thought. <br /><br />Okay, so it turns out that so far this year my favourite class is chem. Dunno why. I guess it helps that John (the teacher) has a funny/cool accent. Some kind of irish/scottish one. Don't ask. I'm not an expert on these things. Point is, although somehow most of the class ends up falling asleep when we're taking notes, at least the classwork is easy. Ish. <br /></div>
<br />Okay, I've run out of stuff to say. Mainly my intent was just to let off a little steam at my 'archnemesis' who doesn't even know I really hate him. <br /><br />Ciao."

<div text=""...long-winded kinda rantyness..."" class=""ljcut"">Well, went to Twang's on friday night, made a lotta noise, happy b-day Twang, umm, got NO sleep whatsoever, which is strange, seeing as we usually get an hour or two by the time we're finished... Tearz and KT were texting Simon some, well, <em>interesting</em> things about KT's so-called anatomy, and no, if you weren't there you probably wouldn't get that hint but I will say no more unless asked. We watched a few movies, none of which were very interesting im afraid, ate pizza, and dear god, why had I never tried V mixed with Mountain Dew before? I should've realised it works far better together than just drinking one or the other. I guess I never really found it that important before.<br /><br />But I definitely needed it cos straight after I got home my <em>dearest</em> mother announces we're going fishing, and off we troop in the cruiser, boat tied on the back, out to Westhaven. And for the rest of the day we fished. Didn't catch much actually, which was rather disappointing, but I swear, I was soooo grateful for those caffeine injections (not literally of course) I had taken with me. <br /><br />Then to cap it off, my parents decided that they should give the fishing thing another shot in the morning. EARLY in the morning. Yeah. Thats what I thought. I wasn't too happy about it, and was rather rude to them. But oh well, they deserved it. They were at each others throats for half the trip anyway when we ditched fishing and just decided to cruise around having a look at the islands. <br /><br />I think its safe to say that I'm getting more than a little annoyed with my parents and the stupid little domestics they seem to be having more and more frequently. They never used to have them much at all, or maybe I'm just at the right age to notice. I prefer to think it was the former though, because otherwise it would mean that I was an ignorant child, and whatever I <strong>was</strong>, I hope it wasn't ignorant. <br /><br />Funny though, because usually people would say they hoped it was the first option so they could assume their parents were happy with each other <em>once</em>, if not anymore... and here I am worrying about myself instead.<br /><br />So I'm a fucked up selfish bitch.

I think I'm going to a friends house for a massive sleepover on friday or something.

If this keeps up, my friends (and I use the term loosely :p) are going to take it for granted that I'll come over whenever I'm in town. Which is usually, unless its in the holidays. Dammit, they used to expect me to <b>not</b> come, even though they asked me anyway. Dunno why they bothered asking actually......

Could it be that they actually consider me to be their friend? How in nine hells did that happen?

Oh well, I can't be bothered trying to change their minds at the moment. This entry is turning out to be totally skewed. Demented. Follow the yellow brick road?

On a different note, perhaps in a completely different octave for that matter, I got a few things sorted out while I was away, and, as much as I hate to say it, some very hazy goals to work towards. Veeeray hazy, mind you. Thats another thing that should be on the list of things I hate. Goals. They bug me. And annoy me. And then, to cap it off, they point at me and mock me.

But hes young, and,....curious, I guess...<br /><br />Meh. I'm just nursing my feet, who aren't looking forward to tkd tonight, but I'm going anyway. Kristen better show up, bitch. Her last exam was French on thurs, so she has NO excuse whatsoever to ditch me!<br /></div>
<br />Um, now I'm gonna go read some fanfiction, mum should almost be in Christurch by now, should I go to Phibz' thing on thursday or not?.....hmmers, much ado about nothing. Where the hell did that come from? <br /><br />Oh well. <br /><br />Ja~"

"event","Well, life goes on. I had maths exam today, bloody boring, but at least I got out early. Think I passed. Hope I passed.

Anyway, right now my feet are rather raw and sore, I'm still in my Taekwondo uniform, have a headache, and thanks to Steven and Isaac, am now obsessed with Final Fantasy: Advent Children. Not that I regret it, in fact, I absolutely <i>love</i> that movie!

Anyway, Reno's really cool, I need a disprin, and I managed to get Emma hooked on it too. But she likes Kadaj better. At least we both agree that Reno has the coolest hair :D

Oh yea, and after the exam we (me, Phibz, Tearz and Emma) stayed at school for about two hours than we really had to because we were having a sort of German tutorial that really ended up with me making weird cat noises and saying 'Frau'. They all thought it was fucking hilarious. I really don't see what all the fuss was about...

Anyway, my heads starting to throb, so I'll heed its call. Its raining right now, and its quite nice. Hopefully it'll keep going so I get some sleep.......

Oh and I am sorely tempted to do an AC theme.....I'll let you guys know if anything actually comes of it. 

Dinner and painkillers, here I come yo!"

"event","Weeeell, I did my English exam yesterday, finished an hour early, was dead bored. And when I say finished, I actually mean <b>FINISHED</b> because I know about how most stupid adults always ask if you've gone over the bloody thing three billion times afterwards to make sure its done as well as possible, well, when I say I've finished, that INCLUDES going over the bloody thing!! Stupid teachers/adults/parents.

God, I really come across as someone who hates rules and society and adults and shit, don't I?

Ah well, I guess its quite true. I don't like being told what to do by stuffy old people who think they're so much better than me just because they're closer to their use-by date than I am. Some people might say that they've 'matured', I like to think they're overly ripe. Or something like that.

The point is, I think (aka hope) I did well enough to pass. I've stopped bothering trying to do better than what I have to. There are way better things I can do with my time.

Anyway, I've got my Science exam tomorrow morning, followed by Japanese in the afternoon. So I'm going to be at school until about 5pm. Am I the only one who sees something wrong with that picture?

Got <i>really</i> bad blisters at Tkd last night, so I've been having fun walking around today...

Found a few cool colour bars to put up on my userinfo page, that was fun...

I don't really have much else to say...

Oh except I never really realised before but not only does SOAD rock! but they also have some pretty cool song lyrics, so if you see any of them popping up around the place, don't be suprised :P

I think thats about it for now, I want to get a drink.

It fucking ROCKS!!!!<br /><br />Tearz and I also had fun messing with Hedgehog's head on Saturday, trying to convince him that he was gay. We couldn't stop laughing most of the time, it was so fucking funny...unfortunately, hes remembered what <em>REALLY</em> happened. Oh well. It was fun while it lasted....<br /><br />Then, yesterday, my mother attacked both myself and Tearz and plucked our eyebrows and straightened our hair. My GOD! I hate it when other people touch my hair! It was bloody torture! There, Hedgehog, you don't even need to get back at me, my mother already did that :P. Of course, all the smart-arse comments I was making can't have helped...<br /><br />
<div text=""Rhubarb's Party and Afterwards"" class=""ljcut"">We went to Rhubarb's party last night, and I must say, it was rather fun. I was tied up with a massive roll of cellotape, and told to escape. I beat Cloudboy and Bruno. In your faces! I was almost deafened <em>and</em> blinded by the bloody fireworks, and I was also shot a few times with a BB. I got dip and cream on my pants and top, and kicked a few people, but all in all it was alright. Simon and Rhubarb and Jack all got cake on their faces, it was disgusting. Simon put chips all through Rhubarb's mum's hair, and Jack was carrying a massive hockey stick or something around for 'protection'. It didn't work too well though...<br /><br />Oh, and on another note, I finally got a nickname for Bruno! I mean, Ruben's Rhubarb (the whole red-headed thing), but we could'nt figure out what to call Bruno. So he is now known as God! Yeah! He has a nickname! I know, that sounds pathetic and stupid, but it was bugging me for ages, ok? Ok.<br /><br />Well, as I said, a fun night, but I'm not sure I'm too happy I went....<br /><br />I can't change the fact that I've already been though, its just that it totally skewed my moood today. You see, I woke up early (nothing weird there) and suddenly had an urge to jump off a cliff. Not to die or anything, just to see what it felt like. As I said, wiggy stuff, and I tried to get it out of my system by listening to loud music, which helped somewhat, but seriously, if I didn't have a morning <em>routine</em> I would've lost it. I hate that. I hate routines. But a routine saved part of my sanity this morning. Scary. <br /><br />Anyway, I'm gonna go have something to eat now, cos my stomach is telling me to. I hate having to eat. Its annoying. Breathing is annoying too, but I have to if I don't want to pass out or die....</div>"

News: I started another piece of creative writing last night, and it <i>might</i> just have the potential to go somewhere. Dunno what its called. We did a resit of the 2003 Physics exam a few days ago, and marked it today. I did much better than I did last time, getting practically <b>all</b> of the merit and excellence questions right, but because of one stupid mistake in an achievement question in the 'formula-y' section, I only got one of the two achievement questions right there. And I needed two. And because it was in the 'formula-y' section, none of the merit or excellence questions could be used to get the basic achieved score. And I could've got excellence in that section if I could substitute an excellence answer. Surely that means that it SHOULD be able to be used for achievement? Apparently NOT. And I got Merit on the 'wordy answer' section. But because they always take the lower mark you achieve, my overall score was a BIG, FAT <B>NOT ACHIEVED</B>

Nil. Nada. Zilch. Zero. Nothing.
Stupid bloody New Zealand NCEA Bullshit.

Got up. 
Went to school.
Sat in vertical form bored.
Went to Science with dickhead teacher. Aka my vert. form teacher.
Crap.
Went to German.
Best class of the day, which is saying something.
Went to morning tea.
Went to Maths.
Probably got detention for not doing homework on algebra graphs.
Wanted to kill teacher because he hadn't explained how to do said homework.
Contemplated ways of killing teacher for rest of lesson.
Realised that I <b>could</b> get up and kill teacher before anyone noticed.
Decided it would not be in my best interests to do so.
Decided I hated my ability to reason with myself.
Went to English.
Started short story. 
Went to lunch.
Got covered in fake blood.
Went to fucking assembly.
I hate assemblies.
Went to Japanese.
Was bored.
Stupid listening excercise.
Walked home.
Made scrambled eggs.
Put lots of pepper in.
End result didn't look particularly edible, but tasted good.

Umm...as for right now. I'm tired. Really really tired. Not as in I didn't have enough sleep last night, but just that I'm tired of EVERYTHING. Which, at the moment, is nothing. You know that sometimes my mother acts like more of a kid than I do? Seriously, she just LOVES bugging me. So it came as quite a relief when no-one made me go with all of the family to look at boats. Maybe they'll find one they like finally and buy it. Then I can stop listening to them complain about how they want one...

Got my school report today, pretty good. I only failed three things, and I've already fixed two of those things up. Don't really care about the static image for English. All my other grades in English were excellence anyway. Dunno why though....
Also, got my Australian Exams thingee Japanese test back, and I got distinction for reading and writing. Yay. I've done well. So why don't I feel good about it?

Hmm. Oh yes, I got a whole bunch of great songs from Maria's. They're cool. Got some Bush (<b>NOT</b> the president!!!), Placebo, Nine Inch Nails, Harry and the Potters (cos I'm just a geek, nyeah!) and Camp Grenada by Allan Sherman. Hey! I couldn't resist, alright!

     -TV is shit at the moment.
     -Okay, I think I'm done.

At least for the moment...
If you want to do something right, don't do it at all.


Now how should I feel, I think I feel alright,
Tell me where to aim, I'm blinded by the light..."

"event","Well, schools over for another two weeks, and then I have four weeks of school, and some exams, and thats it for the year. <br />Happy days.<br /><br />Right now though I'm halfway through cleaning my room, and am currently taking a break, because I'm going to my grandparent's place for the hols. Yay! Flying planes, taking <strong>more</strong> exams, running around and perhaps catching up with my other grandmother and some old friends is probably what my holidays shall consist of. <br /><br />So today, I did practically nothing in Maths, nothing in English, had a shared lunch in Japanese, sat around outside during Science (and sparred a little with Emz) and watched Woody Woodpecker (all in German) and Rammstein videos in German. Then I walked home <em>really</em> fast and tried to ignore the desire to run into the Tennis club and bash a ball around the courts all afternoon as I passed. <br /><br />All in a day in the life of me. There wasn't really any point in even coming to school today. I just&nbsp; talked to Emma about Skydiving and shit. I've decided that for Christmas my family can just get me a Skydiving pass or two. I don't want much, do I? I mean, all I'd want besides that is a few cds and dvds which I'm planning on getting myself anyway, and I'm going to buy my own uniform. Yes, I think thats a good idea. <br /><br />In the meantime though, I'm drinking my spiced up tomato juice, which is just the way I like it; <em><strong>really</strong></em> sour AND hot!!! The perfect drink, and one of my favourites. No need to tell me I'm weird, as I'm already well aware of that. <br /><br />Exam results: English = Excellence, Merit, Merit, Merit, Achieved<br />              Maths = Merit, Merit, Merit, Not Achieved, Not Achieved, Inadequate (aka blank paper)<br />              Science = Excellence, Achieved, and the dickhead teacher never gave us our Chem results, so.....<br />              Japanese = Excellence, Excellence, Achieved<br />              German = Excellence, Merit, Achieved<br /><br />Well, I don't think I did too badly. I just need to revise Algebra and those stupid graph things for the end of year, and practise my German and Japanese writing, and short anwsers in English. Hopefully I'll do at least as well in the real thing for end of year.<br />........time will tell.....<br /><br />Ja ne!"

"event","Well, what can I say, I have had a rather interesting week...<br /><br />First, I've finished with exams. And if I had my way, I would never have to do them again. Sadly, I just realised a short while ago that the world in fact <strong>doesn't</strong> revolve around me. Thanks for crushing my dreams, dad. <br /><br />
<div text=""Tessa's Microwave"" class=""ljcut"">Anyway, after my German exam on Tuesday, we (Tearz, Emma, Curtis, Hedgehog, Phibz, Jesse, Bruno, Cloudboy and me, Psych) all went to Tearz's house, which is, incidentally, right at the back of the school. We stayed until about 4 I think, and in that time, we listened to SOAD, the Foos, watched the beginning of Underworld, destroyed the last of Tearz's pick up sticks set (we were using them as deadly throwing weapons), had a mini water fight, Bruno started playing with the microwave in her garage, and liquidised a cd (Pink lol), inhaled the bad smelling fumes from said liquidised cd, put a few other things in there, started a fire in it, meanwhile I was busy picking the lock on one of Tearz's drawers, and then when the poor microwave finally gave up on life, we took it into the yard, handed Bruno a metal Softball bat, and proceeded to look on as he beat the shit out of it. When we left it was in a tree. <br /><br />It was a very interesting and fun afternoon. Tearz got into a bit of trouble over the microwave though. Needless to say, we made a mess while we were there. All in the name of unwinding after our stressful day. <br /><br />Then yesterday I had my English and Japanese exams, both of which were easy, although in the English one I gave a few smart answers. I was tempted to do the same thing in Japanese but somehow managed to curb the instinct. I seem to want to do that a lot these days. And that just reminded the complement Twang gave me a little while ago, but she said she couldn't decide if I reminded her of Duo, or if Duo reminded her of me!!! That just completely made my day when she said that, cos Duos just so fucking cool lol. <br /></div>
<br />Today I had my Maths this morning and I think I probably failed. I didn't study cos I had better things to do. Funny, I <strong>always</strong> have better shit to do. And then I don't think I did much better in Science this afternoon either. But my mum got me this cool white t-shirt which is actually way too big for me, but it doesn't matter cos its got a gun on the front of it and it says 'Piece'. When I saw it I immediately thought 'One Piece'! So I blame that on Steven. Hes always going on about that or 'Burning Attack'. <br /><br />And finally, this afternoon I downloaded all these cool sound files from GW just to prove that I'm dangerously obsessed. I <em>would</em> expand my interests to other anime, but they're just so damn hard to get a hold of here in NZ. It sucks. <br /><br />Well, I really have nothing else to say now. <br /><br />Adios!"

"event","<div text=""Yellowy shrivelled up crap, and a rant. Kind of."" class=""ljcut"">Yellowy shrivelled up crap.<br /><br />And no, not the crap that comes out of your arse. The crap that used to be eggs before you put them into a bowl with some choice spices/herbs/whatever and shove in the microwave for a few minutes and out comes scrambled eggs. The same crap that turns into this rubbery, shrivelled up yellowy and gross smelling substance when you forget to take it out of the microwave a few times and stir it up a bit. Yeah, thats what I'm talking about. There goes my afternoon tea/dinner. Instead I had canned mushrooms. No need to tell me I'm weird, ok? Good. <br /><br />So now I'm sucking on a strepsil wondering how I'm going to survive tonight, and then remembering that even if I DO somehow manage to achieve the impossible and survive tonight I've got my German exam tomorrow morning. Yea, I meant to study, and no, I didn't actually get around to studying. What can I say? Exams take the back seat in my life compared to all the other <em>far</em> more important things like fanfiction, music, solitaire, msn, and moping around at home while trying and failing to get into the right mind frame I require for constructive studying to happen. Yay. <br /><br />And now I must vent my frustrations and vocalize (is that spelt with an s or a z?) just how much I hate it when people use Evanescence songs in a fic! I mean, god, I don't mind song-fics, some of them are alright when they aren't all pissy and sappy and shit, and when the song goes with the story, but really, I just <strong>really really REALLY</strong> hate it when people use Evanescence songs! For gods sake, they just completely ruin the tone of the story! And GOD! It only gets <strong>worse</strong> when the author gets a 'brilliant' idea (snort) and makes the character <strong>SING</strong> it!!!! [insert profanities here] <br />I mean, those songs are just so over the top, oozing with the fake-ness, and with the whingy my-life-sucks vibes. They were also old about 5 MINUTES after they came out! And now, more than a year later, people are still actively using them in fics!!! GOD WHY DID YOU HAVE TO LET THEM CONTINUE?!?! <br />Grrr, they just fucking drive me nuts!!! Can you tell?!?! I feel crrraaaaaazzzzyyyy! And ready to bash my head against a brick wall a few times too. Those songs should be made illegal!!! ALL OF THEM!! EVERY LAST ONE!!!<br /><br />So should the following words, and/or concepts/ideas, and anything pertaining to them:<br /><br />happy, blessed, blissful, captivated, cheerful, chirpy, content, delighted, ecstatic, elated,exultant, gay (the happy version), glad, gleeful, gratified, intoxicated, jolly, joyful, joyous, jubilant, lively, merry, mirthful, overjoyed, peaceful, peppy, perky, playful, pleasant, pleased, satisfied, thrilled, tickled, tickled pink, upbeat, admirable, amazing, astonishing, astounding, awe-inspiring, awesome, brillian, divine, enjoyable, excellent, extraordinary, fabulous, fantastic, fine, incredible, magnificent, marvelous, miraculous, outstanding, phenomenal, prime, remarkable, sensational, stupendous, super, superb, swell, terrific, tremendous, wondrous, wonderful, ace, super-duper, unreal, smashing, hunky dory, bewildering.<br /><br />More words as I think of them. Suggestions welcome. <br /><br />On a lighter note though, I read a really good GW/HP xover fic this afternoon. I'll admit Heero was a bit out of character, but it was still very well portrayed. Some of it didn't make a lot of sense, but I have a feeling that may be because I skipped the first seven or so chapters when I was still deciding whether or not I had started reading this fic before. Turns out I hadn't. Didn't make me go back and read it again though. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go prepare for my doom.</div>
<br />Ciao. <br /><br />P.S, found this cool Latin saying/motto/thing today. Sapere aude. Means ""dare to know"". I like it :D"

"event","Well, today marked the end of the week. Not bad, huh? I couldn't go online for a day or so because the internet was being stupid, but its fine now. I think my dad fixed it. Hes a genius. I mean, I worked out what was wrong with it, but I'm better at breaking things than I am at putting them back together. Chalk it down to boredom. If it takes too long to solve, I lose interest. <br /><br />Anyway, the end of the week also means that next week we have preliminary exams. Hurrah! <br /><br />Not. It means that I'll be at school until half past four or thereabouts on both Wednesday <em>and</em> Thursday. Lucky me. Not to mention the exam on Tuesday too. Happy days. (Can't you just feel the sarcasm oozing from that statement?)<br /><br />
<div text=""Musketeers, among other things..."" class=""ljcut"">On a lighter note, this afternoon we had German last, and because Sheena was out somewhere else doing something, we had a reliever. I think her name is Margaret or something. Or I could be totally wrong here. The point is that because we were so bored and absolutely determined to NOT do any of the work she tried to make us do, we made Tearz into a Musketerr instead. Emma made her a hat (which actually said pirate, not musketeer, but we were able to overlook that small detail) and I used her pen to draw a curly moustache on her, and a 'stylish' goatee. And because it was all blue pen, I couldn't help but colour her eyebrows in too. Tearz = monobrow. It was quite funny afterwards, walking through the school, with everyone giving her these weird looks. The German exchange students were particularly funny. Probably because they aren't as used to our antics. But really, I guess I shouldn't make fun. Lol. Whoops, I can't help it, its just too good to resist.<br /><br />Anyway, because of the internet crisis and the fact that I don't really have school next week, except for the exams, I haven't had a chance to get the theme songs for GW, or EW. Poor me. Oh well. I can't wait for the Rising Tied to come out. And Eldest should be out soon. About fucking time too....<br /><br />Before I go, I also just want to say that YEAH!!! my grandparents have finished the Jabiru, its up and flying, and it looks fucking awesome! w007! I need to get a hold of some pictures! But yeah, it totally kicks arse. And I'm going to be flying in it these hols! Yay! <br /></div>
<br />Hmm, okay, I'm bored now. Time for me to depart."

"event","Well, today was pretty much a nothing day. I didn't do much. Wait, what did I do?.........Nope. Nothing.<br /><br />But, on a more positive note, I got my German speech checked out and now I can learn it for tomorrow! Mums in Dunners (Dunedin) or Christchurch - one of the two, I'm not sure which - until Friday, and on Saturday my 'happy' little family is going to Woodhill Park for some 4WD-ing! Yeah! And in other news, this afternoon I decided that my favourite mechas are definitley Deathscythe Hell - come on, a <em>double</em> scythe? - Altron - those are wicked flamethrower/claws! dude! - and<br />Epyon - it just looks so funky. Yeah. Gotta love that 2/5/6-ness. Heheh. Or maybe its just me. Oh well. Chalk it down to my 'healthy' obsession with GW. Go Me. :D:D <br /><br />
<div text=""And some geeking out on music..."" class=""ljcut"">And then I discovered this kooky band - Harry and the Potters! Dude, they're like ""we make songs out of books""! Heheh. My<br />favourite one is called Stick it to Dolores. They're not particularly brilliant, but hey, they're giving it a go, ya know? So good on them for trying. Hehe, I just think its soooo funny, definitely some entertainment value there, although I'm not going to go into how good that value is lolsh. <br /><br />So then I started going back in time a little, a bit retro (or maybe wrong decade, but oh well) to listen to Daft Punk. Their song Technologic is pretty cool, definitely ahead of their time I'd say, and I was really dissappointed when I couldn't listen to Robot Rock. Oh well. I'll just listen to Duran Duran and Def Leppard instead. Yep, thats definitely my mum's influence coming in there. She loved them too. :D<br /><br />And now I'm thinking that I really REALLY want to get Endless Waltz, its just a matter of finding somewhere to buy it from. And since I'm just such a sci-fi geek, I want to get at least the first season of Stargate SG1 on DVD. God, I'm such a dork lol. Still waiting on Fort Minor and The Rosewood Fall, I can't wait to get my hands on those cds. And I'm always on the lookout for some more good albums. Which reminds me, I need to get Afro Celt back from Tiz, and remember to bring Sola Rosa for her to borrow tomorrow. Shes finally broadened her musical horizons beyond metal/linkin park lol. Yes, shes gone into stuff like Chicane, Groove Amarda and all that lazy sunday stuff. I don't mind it, but its just a bit too slow for me. Haha, I'll always have a personal soft spot for good rock. <br /><br />And while I'm on the subject of music and my obsession with anime, I really want to get Just Communication and Rhythym Emotion. I need to see if I can download them from anywhere. Yes, it IS a sad thing when you want to download the theme-songs from your favourite cartoon. So sue me.</div>"

<b>Hysteriagalore</b>: Username born from an avid passion for pretty words and Muse (the band). <a href=""http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/muse/hysteria.html"">Hysteria by Muse.</a>

I always have one major obsession at a time, rarely take myself seriously and I have an affinity for fictional angst. I like British spelling, the colour pink and self-deprecatory humour. I COMMENT, I comment a lot on people's entries. This may or may not be a good thing. 22 years old, I'm currently working on my thesis for my B.Sc. in immunology.

I LOVE Great Britain, coffee and Doctor Who. I do not love portmanteau couple names. This is all very important. I enjoy my fair share of fandom crack and intelligent mocking, but I hate the misuse of the concept ""Mary Sue"".

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v137/Ing_Bri/fc.png"">
If you were cut it's because:
- You don't comment on my posts/ I don't comment on your posts.
- Your journal seem dead.
- We never clicked.
- We grew apart and have nothing in common any more.
- I don't read your posts/You don't read my posts.
- It has come to my attention that you are actually a bear disguising as a human.
&hearts; If you're not cut but feel like it's the time we said goodbye, feel free to defriend me.
&hearts; If you were cut but want to stay pm me about it or something.

I wish you all the best guys and no drama, Y/Y?

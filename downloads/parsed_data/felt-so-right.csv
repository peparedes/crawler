"event","so i figure a journal is good for a couple of things. telling people about yer day, getting yer feelings out, and advice. i dont know how many advice posts i have done but....THIS IS DEFFINETLY ONE!

*ok i will start from the begining. There is this guy I like. Now I wasnt supposed to start liking him but I did. So I told him. Now at the time he had a girlfriend. After I told him...things went back to normal and the thought was forgotten. I went to one of the football games and was hanging out with him and I started to like him more. In the next couple of days he told me he started to have feelings for me. After he told me...once again it was forgotten and nothing was said again. I went to the next football game and hung out with him more and I started to like more again. Now when we are together its hard becuase I know I really care for him but I dont think the feelings are mutual let alone they ever would be. So my dilemma is I need advice on what to do. What to I say? What do I do? How do I act? Should I even still like him. PLEASE ANYONE HELP ME!!

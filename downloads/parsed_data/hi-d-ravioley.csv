"event","last night
hung out w/ malri andrea duran and john
 im glad malri is happy w/ duran but i hate it when they fight cause i hate seeing one of my friends sad

andrea~ baseball bat?
 jk

and i spent the night at brecks, i love him so much its crazy!
today we were watching  ELF after we went and got pizza and icecream for me which was a pain in the butt to eat cause he was slammin on his breaks everytime id go in for a bite... lol
but back to while we were watching elf, i would just look at him and i realized how much i really did love him. and when he left, omg i hated it so much
im so used to spending so much time with him that when im not with him i feel... ?empty? like im not fully there and when im with my friends i feel like they feel differnt towards me but i dont care. being in love is the bestest feelin in the whole world! i gave soooo much up for him, like my whole life, cause i partied way too much now im like who needs that, i feel like ive grown up in some way but in some other way i feel so young. i hope ppl can see now that im not so ... ''i have a flavor of the week when it comes to guys'' cause with breck, i dont even remember my 1 night ''hook ups'' w/ other ppl, all i know is that i love him more than words can explain. all that we do is make eachother happy, i love that.

i think that brooke e and lauren need to come home

i miss both of them...

i havent seen my brooke in lets seee.. a long time... too long

and my lauren.. omg my bestest friend, i feel funny if i dont see her once in 2 days.
BROOKE HURRY UP AND COME HOME! O AND BTW DONT TALK TO MY MOMMY ON AOL AGAIN LOL IT FREAKS ME OUT

and im glad im on my summer break
im so sick of high school drama... i only get a 2 1/2 month break from it. i just want ppl to grow up. im tired of the freshmen and soph. and the snr girls esp. causing all this crap! im so glad they r gone. we as in the jr and the snr class girls never really got along. i could care less cause 90% of the are stuck up and just mean.

well i dont have nething else to say.. blah!
so im out"

"event","yeah im bored
i had way too much time to think today
and when i think to much 
i get sad 
and when i get sad life isnt good for the ppl around me
so im just gonna lay out and sit myself in my room and think somemore


life... isnt it great.. not
i made too many mistakes in my lfe and they are comin' back to kick me in the butt.
i just wish it would just stop
i was doin good for a lil bit, but now, HAHAH, not so good
hopefully this is only a day thing
cause i hate it when it lasts for a week or 2

i wish i never did what i did
i wish i never had met some of the ppl in my life
cause im happy w/ them but away im not

im not talkin bout breck cause im happy with him ~ extremely happpy

but other ppl... 
gosh i hate it when i get this way

im kinda glad nobody knows what im talkin bout...."

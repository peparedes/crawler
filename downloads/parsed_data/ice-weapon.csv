"event","it always seem that just when you feel confident and comfortable with a decision that you have made... something will come along to turn it on its head..
i spent the longest time waiting for forgiveness from 1 person..because that person threw a wall up between us that was so big... and the answer was ""i wont , so you had better get on with your life""....
no problem right, if you know you are a good person then you just 'move on'
but if you have to work with that person.. because you own a buisness with them,
and you just feel daggers every time that person looks at you...
well you find a way.. right?
and so i did.. id quit  the job, or would pay her to stay away from the job...
her choice.. but it needed to be made... and id do it..
for the sake of my soul..and my newly reclaimed sanity...

so COOL  .. got it .. done .. right?

no... less than 24 hours pass and well, i call her on the phone to sort out buisness stuff..
and we do.. and she does exactly what she said she would never do..ever again..
she opens up to me.. starts talking to me as if there was never a wall between us
and tells me all the stuff i was told never to expect.. ever again..

and that was not what i expected.. and my resolve shattered into a million little pieces..

all i wanted was to share, and it almost killed me when she said ""never again""
so i said ""ok, ill respect your wishes"" and made the hard decisions to do that..
and the moment i do ... she opens up??

help??? i just dont get it..."

"event","yet another week in my life has come and gone.... felt longer than it was... 

Life has a funny(Re:- sadistic) way of teaching us things...
learen this week that that emptyness is more than just one
of those ""bad"" feelings......
if you  REALLY Want to live..Really live with your heart ands soul 
Eat and drink life as if it was your last meal... Feel the passion..
Chase dreams and all that....you tend to 'feel' with all your heart and soul....
and that leads me sometimes to just ask questions that i dont want to,
dont need to,or allready know but chose not to use the answer for..

as my favorite fish said to me today, whan i asked one of 'those'questions...
""I dont think i ever want to love like that again...it hurts to much...""i said..
before that thought could set in my mind she reminded me...
""No..you dont want that"" ..
As usual she was right ""when there are so many people out there who dont, or cant love like that.. you have to, thats what you do""

So i guess i learned a few things this week .. some good .. some bad
Emptyness has the ability to make minutes feel like hours.. hours like days..
if you live by your heart,You may die by it(like a sword, so they saying goes)
And if  you choose to dream.. it WILL cost you...

But,it IS worth it.. 
and now that i know that again.. i am more ready than i evr have been to find 
someone to share those dreams and chase them down..
.. mine and hers.. where ever she may be...

"event","The haze clears...
and as i gasze upon the wreckage thats is my life,and own the responseability of that kaos,yet again i find myself asking the same questions...

am i here again??
did putting myself on the line cause this?
do i care to much?
is this self inflicted?

the answer to all these questions is YES

BUT .. was there someone there at the end to help me find my feet..again ?

The one thing that I am glad to claim is that I have met incredible people that take care of me. (Take care of myself.) I've known them for a short amount of time, but the relationships seem solid. Perhaps they really are. On the same hand the mistakes that brought me here keep me questioning. Everything. Especially myself and what I stand for. The cards warned me to stay away, and here I sit contemplating what I will do upon my return home. I am afraid to ask for what I want for fear that I will get it, but I need much. For myself, by myself. 
I will not explain myself here. My silence tells me.---"

"event","Have you ever woken up into conscious thought? Wondering what you planned to see that day, or who you will find wanting? Reliving the dream you just had of dissatisfaction and being unfavorable, not that this alone would bring you down, but putting yourself in such an idea allows you to feel its gravity. 
Standing directly in my consciousness this morning I became anxious because I could not stop thinking about the connected world around me. It seems now that I can't really control the thoughts I run with, considering then I would have none to follow.  So I take them as they come.
Do you ever wonder why you spend your time with the people that you do? It's more than just connecting with these people, or feeling happy to see them. You give your time and energy to a relationship, and you allow yourself to be effected by it, sometimes enough to sacrifice something of yourself to satisfy that contact. 
Granted, you get something out of it. You have found people that you can understand, and reflect off of, and consider a part of your life. But what I wonder is what I give to them that makes them want to keep me around. Even more than that, I wonder what I could give to them today to make their existence a more pleasant one. How can I serve your satisfaction? What does your instant gratification call for? How do you feel pain? 
It's so hard to escape yourself. I've become accustom to seeing the Entirety through my own mind. There's more to consider. What about your heart. What do they say about what you see? Although a more difficult consideration, what about your soul? How have you balanced your energy?
I think outside influence is in order.
So after trying to reach Mainy, then Steven, and thinking about finding Justin, I borrowed money from my mother for a pack of smokes, and ran across a half bowl I had left forgotten in my car. 
""I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggers
Get down, girl, go 'head get down""
Ready for another opposite? The people I hold close to me have influenced me tremendously. Changed my life, inspired me to alter my thoughts, and have been considered by me for quite some time now. I wish to do great things for these people. To provide them with experiences that they never would have found without me. I want to create worlds for them. In my case, all these things have been favors to me, because I never expected these people to help me, or correct me, or whatever, but they did. They gave me their time, and I am continuously grateful for it. Can I do the same for them?
(...(I could very well go back to the beginning, and remember all of the favors that have been served to them, but that won't do me any good with the answers that I'm trying to find, because I already know how I see them. .What I want to know is how they see them. .I will find a direction. .I will make it work the first time, as they have been able to do for me. It's only fair that I would try for such things... 
I want to make sure their lives are perfect. How can I really do that though? There are so many things that are left uncontrollable to me, leaving me to work with reactions instead of the actions themselves. .I think that's what I am aiming to change. )...)
Do you see why I tend to question my (sanity) logic? Sometimes I don't feel I make sense. What an odd sensation that is.  
So, this all started because I woke up with a head full of questions and debates of what I see and believe. 
I got more information about my credit, and know now that I have a lot of preparation to take care of before I can advance further with it. (Spring time, she says, spring time) Is that all there is for me right now? Find the problem, confront the problem, wait for the solution? I don't seem to have immediate unbalance, and considering that means I should be comfortable now, I still feel uneasy in the stability. (It just doesn't seem solid because I have no argument to pose.) I feel insufficiant because accomplishment comes later. Waiting does make me anxious. 
I think I have also been rather inconsistent.
-----Damn this boy and his distraction. I'll have to come back later.-----
It's funny how distraction is kind of what I was looking for, and now I don't want it. Not so much distraction, as something else to focus on. I guess I got what I wanted. 
How does one become unbalanced without an outside influence to set it off?"

"event","I am here to think...

When-- I woke up this morning next to Steven. Simply to see him there contented any doubt or turmoil that I have succumb to. 
There is an end. Once I thought I had been wasting my time, or at least, I questioned the purpose of it. Why do I see this boy and allow myself to be influenced by it? 
I supposed there are few answers in the things you can't control. Facing him now, what I see is what I have done to come this far. There is a long continuance in the things that I've learned from Steven. 
He's taken me to a different place in myself that I never would have found otherwise. This is priceless to me. He gave me energy, ideas, a different view to consider. Here is where I am connected. This is what I fear losing. 
Any pain that I may feel is not considered payment for what I have been given, but rather what I am completely willing to give for what I have now."

"event","It must be said that I have been defeated earlier this evening in writing exactly what it is that I have been thinking, and that is because I have wanted to teach it to someone else. I sat down after a day of thinking to write down what I have learned so I may give it to Steven to see what he thought about it. Well, I lost the focus because I thought of too much that I did not want to tell him, or rather, it was other than my original intention. Realizing this made me lose the patience to wander the staircases. But let it be known that taking the long way to work, smoking a bowl, coming to conclusions of the things my mind has been drawn to recently, was no problem when alone. But in the reverse, when I am not alone, I can not make the same connections. I notice this more so now than ever because I wish to teach my concepts to other minds. For example, this perception of Time that I have seen makes sense to me, and I would like the opinion of Steven, but can not find the lesson speakable because I am caught reanalyzing what I have already thought. 
     (A bit of a word on Steven regarding the past two nights: Firstly, last night I recognized the fact that the attention I wanted (to give, as well as be reacted to) and the attention he was calling for did not match. As a matter of fact, they were quite opposite. I told Mainy later that night about how I felt over the whole thing, and the one comment that sticks out to me know, I feel, explains a part of my perspective in this. I told her that I did not receive attention and she said she was sorry. Well, later that night I explained to her Steven's first reaction to me as I walked down the stairs which was, ""DAmn baby."" I explained to her that the remark had made me happy, which justified the (pardon me, please) boredom that I found at the end of the night.) Now you must understand that yesterday I was in a particularly confrontational mood, and Steven was not. Here is where we were opposite. 
You really must understand me here, because this point is very important to me. I notice a lot of things. I blame this partly on my constantly developing empathy, as well as the choice that I made to take all for what it is. I recognize what (for example) Steven does as a part of the pattern that he is encoded with, and from that I may derive what it means. That is not to say that I know what everything is or does or how it effects this World, among others, but I have learned how to figure it out. He has helped to teach me this. You don't necessarily have to ask, you have to feel, he says. So I do. (The monkey on my back tells me all his secrets. My secret is that he is my tool.) 
     ""Sweetness; Sweetness I was only joking when I said I'd like to smash every tooth in your head; Sweetness, oh sweetness; I was only joking when I said you should be bludgened in your bed; Now I know how Joah of Arc felt; ...as the flames rose to rub her nose; And her discman started to melt.""
Anyway, back to my last point...Secondly, this evening. Before work, I had decided that I was going to write down everything that I had thought of on my loop around the subdivisions and give it to Steven the next day to read while he was at school, then ask his opinion. Well, I started to do that, but rereading what I had gotten down, I no longer felt I was with the same mind that I wanted to share with him. Here, I was defeated and turned to the internet where I found Asleigh waiting. I told her I was having a thoughtful night, and do you know what she asked of me? She asked me what it was about, which, consequently, was what I was having trouble explaining. Exactly the response I needed. (This I learned this evening: there are times when I must be asked to be set in explaining myself.) I taught her about my thoughts of Time and how I came over the self-conscious shyness that I have, and how I've had uncontrollable situations that fit into the World I've been given. Just shit that has been on my mind. The thing that I like about her is that she is the same as me in regards to the reactions we have of other people. This is how we connect, and that is exactly what I needed tonight. Well, after seeing her, I came over to Mainy's to see my boy. Here I learned that he missed me, which is something that I have not seen before, and really wanted to talk to him. Not just about that, but that was a start. He ended up talking to Justin about their relationship. I waited for him all night. I waited for him to finish his conversation with Justin. I waited for him to come back inside so we could smoke some pot. I waited for him to come out to the kitchen so we could take a shot. I took one by myself because at this point I was tired of waiting. I waited for him to come outside with me so we might be able to get a few words in. Justin came instead, telling me that Steven was waiting for me. I go back in to where Steven is and he's falling asleep next to Clayton. It's not fair to say that I waited for him all night. This, however, does apply in the respect that wanted to see him, and the entire time he was occupied by something else. I thought he wanted to see me as well, but such was not the case, I don't think. The reason I felt I was waiting for him is because I thought that he wanted to see me, but ended up talking with everyone else. 
Now I sit here, drunk and alone. No worries, because I planned on being alone all night, surprised by the fact that Asleigh invited me out. We found a place to meet halfway, which was to satisfy us both. The thing about this is, Steven invited me out, and when I arrived, I was paid no attention, as if this is where I was supposed to be. (Honestly, saying this now, I believe I asked the same thing.)
Now hear this, for this is what I wanted to talk to him about tonight. I have said a couple of times now that I believe Steven belongs to me, or that he is mine. Well, I heard his silence one night, lying next to him, saying that he did not, in fact, belong to me, or to anyone for that matter. I wanted to tell him that I know this. If he did not want to be close to me, then he would not be. I wanted to explain to him that I recognize this, and that I did hear his thoughts say that there are no bounds to position. I know, Steven, I ,know. I say you are mine only to mean I feel when you are close to me. That I appreciate your very presence and that I have the opportunity to spend my time looking at you. I feel this because there was a period of time when I did not have connection with him. That doesn't mean that I didn't think of him almost everyday, considering how I would feel if he were around, but do me a favor, and try to compare the intensity of missing you to actually being able to walk into your arms, and know that I longed to do so at the very thought of it, not six months ago. Humour me. Know that I do not take your time for granted, and that I do ask the same of you. 
I wish I could tell you this, from my own mouth, not just in words, although halfway is better than sacrificing the entire thought.

Before I lose all coincidental thought, let me ask you this. What do you think? And also: Could you ask the same question of me?"

No, in reality I wish very much not to be alone. At certain times it appears I isolate myself to spite any opposition. Only to myself, naturally, considering I am the only one that would think about it like that, or at all. 
I can figure it out for myself.

I have spent my time very well, and I believe this truly. My time with Steven is always enjoyable, even when it hurts. I sneer at the sickness it makes me think of.

This, too, makes me happy, partly because I know there may be sometime, mostly because I can, and like to have that sort of introduction. (That don't make no sense...) It's difficult to find reliable connections, and I mean that on the terms of mind and attitude. How very indisputable. Lovely.
My lips are bleeding again. What a pain. 
I try not to speak on purpose, because it makes me feel self conscious, but I think that's just part of the deal, so deal with it. They listen to me, and I notice. What am I learning here?

At least it's something to do. 

As far as my artwork is concerned, the ideas remain just as they are, ideas. BUT, the images are there, forming in their landscapes and emotions, making some amount of sense between words and pictures. My hands are undoubtedly out of practice, but patience is all I need to muster to bring the fluidity back to me. There is always the zombie/alien dream I could work on. That one is completed by itself...(Such a slacker...). I remember the part of the story where the 150ft fucking behemoth machine army comes smashing down the street.

It has recently come to my attention that I haven't seen Steven in the past 24 hours. I think this is the longest that we've been separated in months, but honestly, I haven't been counting. Here is my issue...what to do with him? Where to go? How to get his attention? Every single last one of these questions is futile and pointless. Pointless. I have found that there are times when I have few words for him, but this isn't necessarily how I want to spend my time. (Gods I feel fucked up.) I truly don't know why I worry so much. Maybe you can call it a lack of patience, but then where is the balance? Questions, questions, and I have convinced myself that there is no point. What a fickle creature I am. Fear is for amateurs. It is nothing new to be afraid to lose control, but somewhere I thought that was the point. 
Running in circles is a good pass-time, no?
So yeah...paintball rocks my world. 

Just a few more things before I completely lose my concentration. My dreams are fading, they're impossible to remember upon waking, and being sick doesn't help to balance my thoughts in them. Still needs some work, but self satisfaction obviously isn't enough of a worth for me to do it. 
My sketch book is finally out of its bag, although that doesn't mean that I have worked in it at all. I suppose a new book would spark inspiration to my sights, but I don't believe that would cure my impatience for my work.

Faith has been on my mind, unfortunately in a mostly subject matter. This is how I learn. I was dancing in the living room today, half naked and content, to music I can only long to catch on the radio. In those moments, I was happy doing what makes me happy, but also dissatisfied to know that I could do better. Lessons? Perhaps, but that would take too much of my time for what I want to do. Practice? Most definitely. I like dancing because it makes me aware of how my body moves, so to know that I would like to make it better (from my perspective. That's what counts.) also makes me realize that it's not just how it feels, but how it looks. Now I have reason/inspiration to change. Deliberate action. Intentional motive, even if there is an ulterior motive following it. Fun fun.
There is a strange...twinge in this body that I have possessed whenever I pick up my marker. Even if it is just to practice with the trigger. I am attracted to it. Admittedly, I feel foolish with the way that I think about it, but I believe that is because it is so new to me. I must thank my boy for introducing me to such an intense connection to one's self. I enjoy the very thought of learning how to use it, in all aspects of the game. I don't just mean playing, I mean the reaction. I am surprised at how much I actually think about paintball. To be honest, I would feel awkward trying to explain this to him because he is much more experienced in the ways of paintball, so comparatively I couldn't stand up to him. This too shall pass.

It's easier to judge their reactions then I originally thought it would be. I mean that I see my actions as mostly intentional, and recognize the influence I must have to get the chance that I want.

"event","I ask far too many questions to rely on the simplicity of a single explanation. There is never one answer to what I ask, no matter how plain the question or its content. Problems beget more problems, successes inspire more, and so is the way of kai. I see how I try so very hard to condense everything into one central issue, and solve all with one swift hit. I watch my world fail because I am too busy figuring out what it all has in common. 
I love what I have, and know that I have the power to change what I do not. I follow one thing at a time, looking to see what will become of it, and how I can motivate the desired outcome. It never was only ""why?"" and ""what comes next?"". I know this and yet set foundations against it, repeatedly losing myself in corners. It's easy. It's solid, supposedly safe, but ultimately defeating. 
Frustrated would be a good word to mention in all of this. I get really frustrated with myself because I expect so much more than what I give. Lately I have made a conscious effort to do what I know would make me happy. Playing pool, seeing Steven, hanging out with Mainy, even though there is usually many other people present. There are times when my plans don't work out the way that I want them to, or they'll spontaneously change into some unwanted surprise, but gives no other option than to be dealt with. No freakin' choice.
-----
I get irritated partly because I do this in silence. I let the aggravation escalate only to myself, and make it hotter by recognizing the fact that I am keeping it. Most specifically, when I get angry, I almost make it a point to shut it up. I am quite impatient with this bullshit. Why should I make such an effort to quiet this? 
-----
I don't want to fucking chill out. I don't want to present a grand amount of self control. I don't want people to think that my being quiet is just a front to a more outgoing undertone. I don't want to be accused of being shy. In my opinion, being shy is a sign of timidity, and that's just not what I'm going for here. No, I am not a hard ass. I don't talk shit to strangers hoping to take a swing. I am not out to impress you. I don't care if you can't figure me out. Truth is, I know that eventually I won't think of you. 
-----
You must take one thing at a time, but constantly remember all factors in ordinance with the consequences. Although the adrenaline drives the will, and the anxious stress inspires strategy, no matter how outlandish or imaginative, nothing good can be done when you only consider one perspective. You can not always completely trust the sight of one individual, even if you have seen it in the mirror every morning. 
See what is, what isn't.

Whenever he comes up, it seems that what I have to say about him differs from what other people think. (I don't say anything. There is a subtle pain that comes with this thought.) As far as reflections of how I act around him, I feel foolish and fake. I am too calm for what is really going on. I don't like this. I hate it, if I am to be perfectly honest. I don't like composing myself to keep shit chill. I don't want to chill. I want to scream. I want to stand up to him, face to face. I want to confront him and tell him that despite the happiness that I have for his presence, I am truly unhappy. I want--  I want to tell him exactly how I feel. But I feel that this is wrong. That my honestly isn't welcomed? No. Acknowledged. I am ignored. I hate being ignored. 
What he doesn't know is that I could give him so much more.
He could teach me so many things.
I can't do this alone.
He drives me crazy. 
I was so glad that he came over, but let me tell you, two hours after being away, I felt the withdrawal and the realization of what isn't, and as usual, it got the best of me. Left alone and I crashed. Got to work and felt is if I had to drag my sorry ass behind me. An hour later I had a fairly good control on myself, but oh gods did that hurt. It is times like these that make me feel foolish for wasting my time with him. Think about it. I rarely ever get to see the boy, and when he's around, I play bullshit to get ahead. Well baby, let me tell you something. That shit doesn't fly. The next time that I see him, it will either be alone or with several other people. I've noticed that I am much more relaxed when around someone who doesn't know what is or has happened between him and I. What I would like to do is make a day for him and I to go and play pool. Do something, spend the day out. I really would like to talk to him myself. I tried calling him today, but to no avail.

The big issue of the evening: friends.
The problem being that I have none. To be honest, that sounds rather pathetic to me, but considering I don't necessarily have a place that I like to go to often enough to watch traffic, I try not to be so hard on myself.(This being the easiest created opportunity.) So I resort to strategy (It keeps me busy).      Wait(ress)ing would be good to practice bullshit conversations and spontaneous responses. I can use the tips to go hang out at the pool hall and go to dance clubs on the weekends. Perhaps I'll even find a place that I just like to go and relax, but I think that may be pushing it a little. I will make it an exclaimed point to go and do something with myself instead of settling for inside. (All this requires money, which is also another project that I am working on.) For the same reason I am excited to go back to school, on top of the fact that I know I will have interest in this class. I am also going to keep an eye out for art shows and showings. Maybe I'll find someone to lease a horse from so I can enjoy nature the best way that I know how.

I did manage to work out some of the kinks in my thoughts about Steven, convicting myself to the idea of what I want  by considering the consequences of my actions. It seems a little backwards to me, but if that's the way that I have to go about making decisions, then I'm going to have to take a bit more time to myself to work out these metaphoric puzzles. (I say backwards because it isn't a usual pattern to think of what comes after an action before deciding what action I would take. ""Think before you act"". Perhaps this is what they meant? Considering and ultimately deciding what you are to do by first placing a goal in front of you then figuring how to make that connection? Took me long enough to figure that out.) Following all of this is the thoughts of capability to carry out said plan or if your idea of the consequences is inaccurate. What if that doesn't matter to you as much as actually doing what you think will make you feel better? What  you  want to happen.

I reassure Carter time and again that the very least I can do is try, afterward stopping myself from attempting anything at all for the sake of my own insecure fear.

Doing this makes me feel stupid because I know that the things I say have no meaning and only half a thought before going back to ""what does she (they, depending) think now?"". So instead of avoiding this and actually giving her my thoughts instead of trying(ha.) to enforce her own, I feel sorry for the time and attention that I wasted on blundered communication.

As it stands, he is unavailable to me, but not only do I know this, but he knows this as well, and it's hard for me to remember that because I do think there is more to come. (There is a very extreme balance at play here. It makes me angry to look at both sides of this situation because the bullshit is so utterly fucking ridiculous that I wonder why I would put up with it. Perfect example: He came over here one night to get smashed over his ex-girlfriend of two and a half years, and while swimming in his own misery is confessing to me all of the things that I""ve wanted to hear. Now, I do believe that he meant what he said because he was drunk(ha.ha.), but I also know that for the same reason, I should have taken no business with him. It would be unfair of me to say that he is the only one playing this game.) I stand in between this shady shit and wonder if patience will make it go away. Him and I have talked about this, we both acknowledged that Time was what both of us needed, that it is no where near the right time to make change.

I do understand the consequences, so I choose not to push the balance one way or the other, but this doesn't mean that I can't let myself enjoy all that I feel, painful or otherwise. Is it truly best not to fight what I feel? Do I have a choice, like I perceive to? 
(More than anything, I would like to be with Steven, everyone that is outside can see this. But I feel wrong just by saying so. First to follow this thought is the fact that he has a girlfriend, so it is not fair to her to say that I want him. I don't like playing with that shit; no good. Secondly, it is foolish of me because I could very well be setting myself up for another round of black clothing, and why in hell would I want to found that?  Stupid. On my other hand, admitting the situation remains the same leaves me in the same place (depleted) that I was a month ago, except I've gained a couple of good people. This isn't to say that I am not grateful for the company, but I know that there could be more to it than that. {How can you tell a boy who at least claims to be happy that you can make him happier? It just isn't right. Not with the way things are.} The option that I am left with is to just chill out and not let myself wait. {Waiting makes me anxious.} No, I don't freak out about it. It doesn't break my heart to think that this is it. The only pain that I feel from this is thinking that I may never keep what I want {although I didn't have it in the first place}, but how could I go on believing this bullshit?) 

Look, I am quiet because I am comfortable that way. I don't know if it is a habit I can break, or even if I would be better off without it, but right now I know that sometimes this is what I need.

I think that it is time for me to face what I have worked so hard to destroy, and that is the simple fact that I can't have him.

Let me tell you something that may give you one perspective on where I stand when it comes to Steven. Earlier today I was trying to think of one thing that I would like to do, naturally. Well, the first thing that popped up into my head every time I posed this question, the only answer I got back was clear and simple. I want to call Steven and tell him how much I need him, and how just by his existence, he makes me happy. I can't deny this, to myself or to others, no matter what stands in the way of anything being done about it. I know that if he were to show up at the door, my heart would threaten to take over my body. I understand that if I could just love him, that nothing else in the world could go wrong, even if I were to watch it all burn to the ground. And you know what? I haven't stopped thinking about Steven since he started coming around me again. There is no way to get around it, no way to block it out, or to get over it, or push it away. I can not fight this, and believe me, I have tried to put my entire energy against this ache, but who is there to tell me that I shouldn't? 

Look, I know that this may seem ludicrous that I would just so blindly continue with this charade of ""we both know what it is that we are facing, but nothing is going to be done about it"", and I agree, it is. It's fucking ridiculous that I would think of nothing except for him, from the very moment that I wake up to my very last conscious thought. He is even in my dreams. (He is my dream.) This is the one person that I have encountered in my entire life that I have ever been so much in love with that it hurts to look at him. Undeniably so. The only person that I know my life would somehow be incomplete without. To make this more interesting, I know that he feels the same way. I've seen it, and even more than that, I've felt it, believed in it. (I am sure of this, but I also doubt if he has admitted it even to himself. I can see his eyes glaze over when he remembers what I am to him. Stupid.) The worst of it is that I can't do a fucking thing about it. I can't express it or imply it. Why? When I draw I wonder if Steven would like it. When I hear a good song on the radio, I want him there to hear it with me. After work, the thing that I want the most is to see him sitting on the couch waiting for me. I want to be able to touch and kiss him as much as I damn well please, and not have to think anything of it except how wonderful that is. 

It hurts. It is so very painful to admit that we can't even acknowledge the fact that any of this is going on because it's wrong. (Love is wrong?) It's wrong that we would even consider carrying this bullshit any further than our own minds because it's not fair to anyone involved. I have finally found the love that I have been trying to find since my history started, and I can't keep it. I can't keep Steven. And now I have to just sit here and pretend that there is something around that will hold my attention away from him for more than three and a half minutes. I'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be anything that I can do about this. The only way to make this obsession leave me is to stop seeing Steven, and let this feeling fade one more time. (I don't want to. It's too good to just up and forget about. It's worth it...isn't it?...)

What I want to know is what kind of fucking Fate decided that it would be funny to show me everything that I wanted, to hang it on a hook right in front of my face and dare me to bite at it? Why does he have to be with someone else, when I know very well that him and I deserve to be together? Why can't he stay with me? Why am I not allowed to keep this? Did I miss something? Have I failed or is this the test? (Is this what you wanted Steven? A fucking test, like everything else was? To be able to excuse it as doubt?) 

FUCK this."

"event","I am a dreamer. This is undeniable, and I like it that way. I enjoy the astral trips through my subconscious mind, uncontrollable except to the boundaries of thought. I can only say that I like having these places created of Energy to visit, although it may make me sad to see them fade in the morning. I have a hard time trying to explain to you what these images do for me. It's a channel really, a form of expression that can't lie, and comes entirely from the self. You can think of it as a way to see what you're brain does when no one else is looking. 

So what is there to say about someone who dreams while they are awake? If they were to come up with ideas that make them happy, knowing what it would mean to them to have that dream come to reality? Only then to wait until that image passed through your memory, forgotten and unsatisfied. I can't say that this used to bother me as much as it seems to now because, until recently, my fantasies were useless and just that: fantasies. Made up stories that I used to amuse my idle brain cells. 

Well now I have seen something that I want, a dream actually. A materialized dream. 

Okay, way to feel effectual. And I don't seem to be able to make up my mind as to whether this is a waste of my time or not. Why would I ever want to start some vague idea that I could not finish? Especially when it is all a figment of my mind. Perhaps possible, but only by the smallest of chances and only if I'm lucky. It's too bad I don't believe in luck. Just a dream, something that is not real. Great.

Now what I don't understand is why the physical boundaries that come requisite to this realm have to be so frustrating. I'm not just talking about the concept of walls blocking one room from another. I mean the literal boundaries of emotion, action, movement, and whatever else you can think of that can be defined as human. At times, I prefer to focus on the dreams I come up with rather than the reality that is, to follow the leads of my imagination if for no other reason than I am happier there. So foolish."

"event","To be honest, I don't really know what to say, but that isn't to imply that I don't need to speak. It's not even so much that I could not find the words to describe what's going on and how I feel about it, but rather that I don't see anything constructive about putting it in order and analyzing it when I'm just going to have to take it apart later. 

I remember that I had mentioned I was returning to a place that I had been before, seeing a pattern in the way that things in my life played themselves out. As it turns out, this is not entirely true. I have been here before, but only in the most general of senses. In terms of how I feel and how I deal with things now as opposed to what I may have done a month ago, I have a changed perspective in which I see the world as it is around me. 

To put it differently, I no longer solve my conflicts with this let's-fuckin'-get-this-taken-care-of attitude. It would be more accurate to say that I don't anticipate the outcome, and I don't expect any one approach to have a greater or lesser effect than another. It's just what is it? how can I fix it? what's next? Fine. I think in a way that is very cut and uncluttered, although I have yet to decide if this is a good thing or not. Currently, it seems to be working rather well for me, I get my shit done, and have no anxieties or doubt as to why I am doing whatever it is that has to be done. On the other hand, I think that if it were to come down to something like a decision that would only have the ability to persuade for example, someone to a conclusion one way or another, when one outcome would be just as complicated in its influence it has on me as the other, that I would choke as to know which way would get me what I wanted. 

I've said this before. I don't know what I am looking for. I don't know how to find it. What I do know is that I would have no greater chance of coming across my wishes any faster if I looked for it than if I just continued with what I had, and inactively watched as it passed. I could blame it on this place, on my time, against my efforts to sooth such convictions to keep the peace between my ears. The only real offsetting factor is that I don't have much negativity towards anything except the subtle frustration. I've noticed something kind of weird, but I can't say that I've given it too much thought...on any normal day, I don't usually smile all that much, and at the rare times when I do, they don't last for very long. They just seem to slide right back off of my face, just as quickly as they had appeared. I don't know, just a thought that crossed my mind today while I was mopping.

To say the least, I have been seeing my own self progress further from what I was, and not only do I acknowledge such things, but I accept them. I must admit that this is somewhat new to me, but I don't like to boast myself to it. It took a lot of work and I choose to be humble with what I have recreated rather than flying it on a string. 

To put all this into the most basic terms, I am angry, but I am okay with that. There are some things that I am not satisfied with, but that's fine. It doesn't feel like waiting, but that doesn't mean that I like it."

"event","Ugh. I just woke up...my head is spinning from the smoke and the obnoxiously loud levels of the neighbor's bass. Outside it's wet and cold from the snow that blessed us the evening before, deterring me from wanting to leave the house, but I must admit that the world is attractive when it's covered in blankets. 

My vision is also blurred by what remains in my mind from the dream last night. It's unfortunate that I can not remember all that has passed along the way through my subconscious, but I recall enough of the conclusion to know how it went. In so few words, I dreamed of love, of passion, of anticipation. How depressing. Ha ha. 

It started in a tree house. Now don't get the wrong idea, it wasn't exactly something that you could go and find in some little boy's back yard. It was huge, I know of at least four stories. The construction was a bit rough, the interior put together with wood, nails, and chains, and the windows were nothing but cut out holes in the side walls, nothing close to perpendicular. I like to call this place home, although I think the structure represented a place inside myself, one that is unfinished and leaves splinters, but holds the idea of purpose. 

The first of my encounters was a blonde boy. I don't remember his name, but I do know that his perception of me was not currently accurate. (He thought me as...not so much stupid, but ditsy and unintelligent, fickle, and immature. Like I had no idea what was taking place. Like I was inadequate and incompetent.) After my shower, I called him. After I jumped around the platforms of my wood-scape, I called him. In the middle of reading a book on my bed made of blankets, I called him. Each conversation was the same. He sounding un-excitable that he was on his way to see me (whenever I talked to him, I could actually see him as he answered and talked back. He was in a green car on a one road highway. His mother was driving, not exactly paying attention to anything but what lay ahead of her) and all that was covered in these conversations was that he was getting closer, and that we would see each other soon. The trip was going okay, and he was too. Nothing extraordinary about any of the calls, in fact, it sounded like he would prefer it if I didn't bother, since we had nothing new to say anyway.

When he arrived, I was flooded with a happiness that pushed up against the sides of my being, threatening to burst out of me if given the chance. Well, since he returned no such feelings, that didn't happen, but we fucked anyway. As for the gruesome details...he was big enough to touch the top of my cervix, but as is record, I could not get off. The strange thing about us having sex was that he was face down, hiding his head in the pillow. I suppose he was trying to ignore me. Unsatisfied, he would meander around my house with no real agenda. I would find him and try to get him closer to me, talking to him, kissing him, willing him to notice what I really was. Eventually he faded out. 

The next visitors that I had were two boys of which I already knew. They could be identified as Sean and his best friend Ben. As we sat on the platforms in the largest of the rooms, they teased me. If I were to try and talk with them (I recall one of the topics to be artillery), they would just look at each other and laugh, like I was ignorant to what I was saying. Funny part of it was that I did feel ignorant up to this point, but only because of the way they reacted to me. So I told them to leave, they had no purpose to sit there in my space not help me with anything. 

At this point, I flashed to the beach. There was what I assumed to be my tree house(which looked remarkably like the green house that I saw in a dream previous to this) standing right in the middle of a bending stretch of sand, the water a creamy blue, breaking into white waves. I could not count how many people were there. I knew most of them, family, people who I have seen walking through hallways in some long forgotten place. Whoever, it didn't really matter. I felt very much like I had to forget all of this place. It was not just that I was no longer happy here, but that the very sight of it was starting to hurt me. There was a sharp pain in my heart that could no be soothed any longer by the rolling waves that swept up the shore. 

Now here's where it gets a bit unfocused. I remember leaving this beach, searching for someplace that is more suited to what I wanted, for surroundings that were more predictable and less crowded. Well, I found such a place. I don't know how I got there. I didn't understand exactly what it was. Up to this point, the sequence of the dream is lost either in action or understanding. 

There were three other figures that I can identify standing in a small dark hallway that dead ended into a doorway of green light. My best friend, my love, and his shadow.

My best friend was the one that had lead me in the direction I needed to follow to get out of where I was, supported my thoughts when I needed the validation, and helped to fight off harmful influences. 
The shadow was nothing more to me than someone that I had to acknowledge and respond to.
But my love, oh my love, was what I aspired for. What I ran away for. What I struggled for. Upon our meeting, I was instantly intrigued, but not quite able to know what it was I had to do to get him to return the favor. Surprise surprise, the figure was none other than Steven. I was able to gain his attraction by letting out of myself what I wished him to see, or more specifically, what I was able to let out. Granted, the emotions that passed between our energies was very much like what has actually happened. I was timid to the intensity, but drawn to it unlike anything I have before. He was sarcastic and unpromising, but that didn't change the fact that he stuck by me, despite what he had to endure to get there. The ache was impossible to extinguish and terribly bitter sweet. It was at this end that our primary ties were broken.

None of them could follow me through the door. It would not allow them to, and believe me, we tried. As I allowed the light to consume me, I felt this incredible twisting of my self as I awoke back into this world. It's hard to explain exactly what happened to me through that transition, but it was as if all of the energy that I had experienced in the dream melted back into me, leaving my body with nothing except the sadness of reversal. 

My heart beats a little faster today. My head a little heavier. I need a cigarette."

"event","I feel my Energy returning to me. It's not really something that I think I can describe to you with any amount of accuracy. The very tone of the sky is more vibrant that it has been for a few weeks now. Clouds of pearl and the blue so soft you become lost in it. Gorgeous.

I wonder if anyone else saw that?

Last night I dreamed of a driving force of which I have never felt before. There was such a definition to it, and yet it was honestly unsure. Instant and effective, but mostly followed by a delayed consequence leading towards a larger goal. It made me feel very separated from the environment in which I was placed, although I was obviously a part of it (had I not been, my actions would not have made a difference.) I was not influenced by the other Energies that were trying to effect me. They were negative to me, so I rejected them and turned them away.

I thought about this as I walked through the woods today, noticing the subtle details of everything that surrounded me. It's strange that I have come back to that perspective. Of seeing the Natural as mysterious and hopeful. New, as though I didn't know how the woods were made to look as they do. Since then, I have felt refreshed and inspired. I am glad for that. 

Given these things, I have been able to take myself away from the things that hurt me. Not by suppressing them or making them less, but by accepting it for what it is, and choosing not to put myself next to that influence. Dealing with it, I suppose you could say. Hooray for me. Now it's time to move on. 

It wouldn't be too much for me to say that I feel better than I have been recently. Whatever stress, anxiousness, or doubt that I have been feeling is still inside of me, swirling around and around, remaining unchanged from itself, but I no longer feel pressured by it. I want things to be better. I really do, and to say that I must be patient and persistant doesn't help. I already know this, but I no longer need the validation of it. I have seen that I am not stopped along my path, just that I am moving at obnoxiously slow speeds, but that isn't something that can be erased so easily as to satisfy my want to instant gratification. Fine, then let it be. 

Recently I have acknowledged that there are subtle differences in the way things are. Rather slight, but nonetheless recognizable changes in the standing order. Mainly the relationships of which I am involved have been effected, either for the better or the worse, depending on where we are looking. I am relieved, yes, as with the previous Times that I have stood here, but it is hard to say what will have to be done next. I anticipate the movement of the writing on the walls, but at the same time, have to remember to stop and actually read what they are trying to tell me. This is another period of learning, of watching for lessons that are brought before me, and doing the best that I can for the greater good. It would be foolish of me to draw away from it, to only take what I must, instead of taking all that I can. This perspective gives me the sensation of drawing in a large breath, not of air, but of Energy. At some point I feel that if I don't assume a...cautious attitude of things around me, I may to taken off guard, only to have to correct that imbalance. 

I am approaching a stage of balance. Yeah, you could say that. 

In any case, the world is once again on the move, and I must do everything in my power to make sure that what I want is executed with the utmost focus, precision, and attention. Though I should not forget that my decisions do effect more than myself. There is much to be done. From what I see, it seems that I am going to require a more pronounced point in my actions, and my intentions will have to remain somewhat separated from my force. Subtlety and dedication is what I assume."

Apparently I am the most irresponsible person that was ever to live in this household. Gods forbid, I didn't wait until my laundry was done before I left. Fuck this. I am so sick and tired of dealing with everybody's ""human nature"". Well, their human nature can go and suck my dick because I don't care at all what they think, do, or have to say. 

My brother and I sat for and hour today and plotted against my mother while she was asleep in her bedroom. I convinced him to talk to dad about moving into the attic, saying that it would be much better for him, and that he would undoubtly be happier over there then he ever was here. We discussed what a terrible parent mom is, and how she judges her children with out effect, and unfairly. He doesn't care, and knows just as well as I do (well, now he does) that there is nothing to be done about the situation to make it better, or to change it at all, except to leave it to rot in it's own self-inflicted filth.

Oh yeah, it's snowing.

I feel as if I am not getting anywhere. Not one step closer to where I would like to be, but why is that? Is it really because there is something more important that I must take care of first?, or that I must wait for something else before anything can happen?, or is it just me? Am I the only thing that is stopping me from progressing and advancing further through my life? I am beginning to think so, but as it stands now, I'm not going to school because I feel it an urgent matter that I get out of this house first, and I haven't gotten a job yet because of the economy. Well, as far as a job, that is mostly my fault. That is to say, I haven't really put an effort towards correcting that matter, even when I did have money to spend on gas. In regards to school, yes, I must get out of here first, but I don't even know how much money it will take up front to go, if I must spend any at all. That is my fault. 

It's hard to say what comes next. I think a lot of it has to do with timing. I believe the cycle is about to repeat itself, and soon I will have to deal with quite a bit at one time, as I have had to do the last time I was here. New moon. In a way, I am looking forward to it. Naturally, problem inquires action, and therefore change, but will it be all that I am expecting, or will it be bullshit that I don't care to care for. It would be wrong of me to expect the unexpected, but I do hope that I am not disappointed with the way that I make things turn out.

I will tell you what it is that has me so sad, what brings me down everyday that I choose to wake up. First you must understand that this feeling isn't something that can rub off as the day wears through me, because it rests much deeper than can be touched. It rests in the center of my heart. A throbbing ache pushing against the walls of my being, begging to be released, pleading to escape and fall out of me. 

To my misfortune, there is no why that I have found to ease this. I know that there isn't one, because it's not something that can be put off and made any less than what it is. I feel void of anything passionate, of anything that you can look at and smile, just knowing that you have that one thing, if nothing else. Granted, I have desires when it comes to drawing and things of that nature, but it does not even begin to compare to the intesity that I wish to give to someone.

Now don't take this the wrong way. I don't fret about not loving someone, or being alone or lonely, or anything so modest. It's not love that I lack.    There are things in my mind that no one knows about, that no one has seen, that no one deserves. It is these thoughts that are trapped inside. I can not let them out without someone to take them from me, to invoke their presence. It seems strange to me that I can not give this sort of intensity to anyone I choose, but it makes sense that I can not feel it until my heart if full. 

That's just it. I can't feel it. There is nothing there to feel. (Claustrophobia.)

You know, I have read this entry several times over, and I don't think that it gives a very good idea of what I am trying to say. It doesn't express how unsatisfying this is for me. The fact that I can't hold someone and know they are mine, that I can't feel so much pleasure that it becomes more painful with every passing glance. 

I know what I want. I know what I'm waiting for. I hate waiting. 

It makes me not want to go anywhere, not to see anyone, to talk to anyone. What the hell is the point? I have talked about how I want to be alone. Well, this makes that impulse stronger and more irresistible. (""Wouldn't it be cool if you could just curl up and die?"")I have a hard time bringing myself to ""look"" for what I yearn after. (It seems useless, wasteful even.)

For example, I remember earlier today I was telling Carter about how when we are hanging out with Hector, there are times when I don't feel there is anything I have to say to him. Same idea. It's not that I don't want to talk to him, or even that I don't have anything to say, I just don't feel like saying it. It's hard to deal with, you know?       Of course you know.

Bottom line is that I am tired of feeling dull and empty. I don't like the feeling of the winter wind swirling around my heart. At times it feels as if I am in danger of losing passionate capabilities entirely, before I even get the chance to experience it. I do not believe that I will, but it's the principle of the unfulfilled soul that drives this to bother me so much. I don't particularly like wanting to be alone, but who am I waking up for?"

I had a burned cd of Deftones, and so I had to look up all of the titles to the songs (mostly because I'm just anal like that). I listened to every single one, typed in the lyrics, and searched for them...It took an hour and a half to find all of the songs because I couldn't understand some of the words through the screaming. Needless to say I had a pounding headache afterward, but the point is I sat here for the entire time for no real reason.

The silence is thick. It blankets the air that suffocates her mind. Get me out. Get me out. 

It's been like this for hours now. There is an impression on the carpet from where she hasn't moved, not one muscle. All that matters is the nothing. 

I want to be alone. I want to go away. Please let me be alone. 

Not to exist is but a dream. A useless thought, but the only one that does not stress her mood. She melts into the dark, the silence, and is forgotten."

"event","I have to say that I don't feel much like writing, but for some reason I can't stop thinking about it. I don't even know what I want to say...if I am to say anything at all. The only real thoughts left in my head are of escape, and what it would take to be able to slip out the back door. I imagine all the work I am going to do to be able to carry Carter and myself far away from this dismal place. 

I am looking into a school called Michigan Tech. It's the top engineering school in the state. I don't really want to talk about that though.

Steve took me out job hunting today. He kept talking about how ""we"" were going to go out ""together"" and look. How he would drive me to all those places to apply so I wouldn't have to use what little irreplaceable gas I have left. I just felt like telling him not to bother, I'll do it myself, but if I were to say that, then he would inquire why I wouldn't do it before. Whatever. That's all I really have to say about that. 

This whole thing is just a waste of my time. This place that I am not satisfied with or included in. These people I see walking down the street lack substance. They are so hollow I swear I can see right through them. The circumstances in which I find myself stuck in just continuously frustrate and irritate me, because it's all bullshit. It all is pointless and serves to nothing that is real. So why bother with any of it. 

I feel as if I am fighting all that is around me. Constantly dodging flying criticism and jabbing at false images. I don't think that it will stop. The only thing that would keep me from fighting off every issue that dares to challenge what I believe would be the person that could get close enough to me to hold my hands to my body, immobilizing my struggle, and finding a way to surpass my impatience. Yeah fucking right. 


Soon my love. Very soon it won't matter anymore."

"event","It seems that everything around me is moving so quickly that it's standing still. Nothing changes, but the situations that surround me are.

I am still in the same perspective with my mother. Today she's all smiles and high pitched voices. I told her that I would start to clean up Nana's apartment when I go over there later tonight. I'm sure she still thinks that I'm a little asshole, but no one has to tell her what she hasn't noticed. 

As far as 'the boys' are concerned, nothing is going to change the happy little box that they have put themselves in. Fuck that. In the end of this on going shit fest, all will be well, whether they know why or not.

I believe that my beloved Carter will soon be rid of the negative influences that have been bringing her down lately. Praise Ka. When I compare this last week to the past couple of days, I have no doubt that she will be happy once again, unburdened by unnecessary slander. 

My dreams are growing increasingly vivid and complicated. The very thought makes me curl my toes in delight. To be so connected with my unconscious mind serves a powerful tool to my creative energies, as well as my state of being. I know that this sounds like a bit of a stretch to claim, but with my dreams, I am happy. It's hard to explain the way I feel about them. (Part of that has to do with the fact that when I do try, I think I sound rather foolish that the message comes off so...foolish, I suppose.) All I can really say is that I am devoted to them. Even when they show me feelings that are unpleasant. I see things that no one else can. I know of places that one could only dream (haha) of finding. I am so thankful they have returned.

As far as my drawing is concerned, it's a long work in progress. I notice that when I draw from a book, it's easier to see the lines on the blank page then it was before. But as you could imagine, drawing from your own mind is much harder than copying from one medium to the other. I have so much to learn before I will be able to accomplish the level of talent that I am striving for. I plan to continue getting picture books and copying different figures until I can do this with ease. I think that will teach me how to see the relationship between lines. Then I will begin to create my own images, studying how much I have gained in vision."

"event","Oh geez...

I think all that I was trying to say yesterday was that I'm frustrated with the thought of having to fulfill this idea of being with somebody. I find it ridiculous and just one more title to attain. If humans could survive by themselves, then I would. I don't want to have to make this a major effort of ups and downs. 

Since this is impossible...I just want to love someone. I want them to love me. I want to be with this person and be happy and have lots of sex.

Is that so much to ask?

That's not even the whole of it. That's only one example. I'm just growing very impatient. Mostly with the fact that I don't really have too much to effect. Pushing on air, I suppose.

Whatever. I'm going to go draw."

"event","The mind is a very complicated. Hard to understand, even when it's your own. Second guessing, contradicting, spiraling visions that can't be deciphered. It's seems strange that one would have a hard time figuring out what thoughts are reasonable and which are abstract. I mean, it's a mind that belongs to you, so shouldn't it make sense? Shouldn't you be able to tell? 

It's all part of the fun. A mystery to yourself. Personal discovery. Self definition. 

Even so, that's not the end of it. Once you have a clear picture, what do you do with it? Let's say for instance, your idea of love. What do you want, what do you need, what would make you happy? Well, such thoughts that involve emotion must be satisfied; compensated, expressed, and reflected. 

The search begins. To think that it would be...I wouldn't even dare to say easy, but rather at least a little promising, would be foolish. I can not even begin to think about how many stupid people there are. It's actually gotten to the point where it becomes frustrating to even think about meeting new people. I don't really know how to put exactly how I feel about the whole social situation...thing. I suppose part of it has to do with the fact that I am a rather monogamous person; I prefer to sit with a few people, at the most, and just chill. It's more intimate and serves more the the purpose of getting to know that person. 

You know what. I don't really feel like talking about this anymore. I'll continue this tomorrow (if I don't find it to be completely stupid like I do right now), when my brain isn't so glossed over by the drugs..."

"event","Here I am again, sitting in a dark room, not caring for too much except the flashing screen. 

I think of Carter and how blessed I am to have her as my best friend. I am convinced the Gods and Goddesses crossed our stars when we were created. Blessed to the Energies for Carter.

I don't care if no one truly understands her and I. I pray they never do, for if they were to comprehend what is between us, they would forever be envious of it."

"event","How does a six hour nap suit you? As Carter has brought to my attention before, I sleep more hours than I am awake. Why is that? I don't really know, but I choose to believe it's because my sleeping world appeals to me more than my waking world. My problem now is finding something to relate to at this hour...whatever.

I dreamed well last night. The first setting was a cage. Just a very large cage that held me and at least a dozen other people. The point of this cage was to catch drug users at their best, and electrocute them for it. The voltage was low; it was more of a slap on the wrist. I remember having to go around to all of them and asking them how much they would be willing to sacrifice to get out of the cage. Most only gave me a small nugget of pot, one shroom cap, or a couple pills. (This suggested that they did not want to leave, especially not anytime soon.) None of them were allowed out for it, but I had quite a nice stash going for me. Unfortunately after I escaped through the unwatched door, it turned to ash.

The next part was a bit strange, so bare with me for a moment.   Alright, basically, it was a giant Monopoly board. Of course the spaces weren't the same, but the general idea was. For each space that you landed on, you could either choose to keep going, or you could descend into the monstrous sand pit below you and choose an item. 

This fucking place was a store. 

Okay, so on these racks of stuff, there was any nick-knack or invaluable thing you could ever imagine. Wind chimes, scrying tools, incense burners, things you could use to talk to the Divine, Energy converters, tools used for summoning Spirits, dragon everything(this is obviously my dream), all the things that you could think of from the realistic to the completely intangible, the entire collection covered in colorful metallic finishes. 

The significance of this place isn't entirely clear to me, but I do know that I had to fill out political paperwork before hand. I'm sure they let me in by default only because I had so many problems with their system. I just remember a lot of running around. 

Anyway, the dream ended when they got suspicious of me stealing. Naturally more than half of what I had had been stolen, but it's my dream and I'll do what I want. The last thing I remember is walking outside into the bright sunshine onto a crowded city street."

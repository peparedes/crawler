"event","walking home today was fun with John and joanna i kind of lost morgan and jason but whatever they have each other. what is meant to be will be that's all i have to say. wow! tonight was really fun i wasn't planning on going hence i didn't know about it but i'm glad i did. i went to my friend, Kianni, youth group meeting. we sang and talked about the Lord and got cool black bands - which i'll wear tomorrow - and semi-celebrated Ashley's birthday. (I know her) we had cake and pretzels and drank soda yum yum yummy in the secluded room it was just us girls and we talked about our problems i love doing that it makes me feel really gooood ;) well next week Kianni and i will be attending Rissals meeting. she better introduce us to everyone (including that hott guy!) lol morgan .. i actually saw you today how exciting mhhhm it didn't even feel like a wednesday today definitely like the weekend or something - at least to me. some people i saw tonight were people such as mauricio and girardo and gustavo and ashley. cool cool 

to switch the topic i can't wait til' this weekend. friday i'm going out with renee i'm happy we're making TIME for eachother definitely definitely and then saturday morning i'm wanting to go dress shopping for homecoming and wanting for morgan to come - if she has time - but i'm glad her and jay are together JAY: the way you talk about her is just unexplainable sweeeet look:

Me: mmkay. how are you?
Jay: IM WONDERFUL

um well i guess that's all for today. it started off really very bad but then i saw reeeneee and it got soo much better. that was the third time i've seen her this year. and kathyrn to i miss her we see each other only twice a day that's not a lot to converse about certain things but whatever at least i have both lunches with her... I'M OUT!"

anyway about my 16th birthday. i have a jist about what persons i want to invite it's just that some of them i haven't talked to but i'd feel bad if i didn't invite them. i know i have a limit just not sure of how much. what do i do? aahh! ""i'm sinking like a stone in sea."" boy isn't that true. can you tell i put on Brand New! well.. bored as i am i guess i'm done. nothing to do here i neeed to talk to someone but that person i want to talk to isn't online and i can never talk to him alone but i need to find a way. well buh bye for now i guess"

Agata works there so we all talked for a lil bit. The somewhat part was me being crushed by my love! You see, no names, he knows i like him, but no response! ::tear:: When Mason told me things that i didnt wanna know it hurt me even more.. i was a little depressed. then after the games were done we just hung around inside til the officer said we had to leave. then we all hung outside til our rides got there. Mason and my sister were flirting.. thats terrible! Mason you really hurt me nigga heh um yeah i was mostly with Jamie starving for even a little attention. but i was receiving not that much i tell ya. :( every little while he would play with me outside but thats just about it.. um Alan was there playing pool with his gay lil brother (inside joke) umm well im going to go because im tired nd talking to Mason on the phone.

"event","<P>Tonight was a pretty cool night. Just casual I guess. I guess it started off pretty early I just had to tidy up my room and just do a lil' laundry. The RE was coming for an open house from 1-4, which we weren't aloud to be home while this is going on. So, I took the keys, along with my family, and we ate at DiSalvos. We also brought my dog, GUCCI!! Then, after that, I drove straight on down to the beach. We stayed a lil' more than a 1/2 hour. My sister was just taking the dog back and forth and BAM! she met a guy. His name was Brandon. I have to say he was pretty cute. He definitely had manners ;). He had come from Detroit, Michigan. He has only been here for about 3 / 4 months. So, my sister doesn't have a cell phone, and he didn't either. So, she decides to ask for his sn, but it turns out that he didn't have a computer either. He just ended up saying,"" I guess I'll cya around then."" But, still he was such a sweet guy, of course they talked for about 15 minutes. Maybe this guy was meant to be, but I'll guess she'll never now. Unless of course it's really faith and then they meet again. ( HOPEFULLY! ) Well, I'm not really doing anything right now. I'm just excited yet mad too.. excited because I'm leaving for New York this upcoming weekend, and it's exciting to see peoplez you havent seen for over a century lol. A little upset because Paul had invited me to Warp Tour, and DUR! definitely wouldn't mind going. But, I'll be in New York. Can't have everything you wish for, now can you? <FONT size=5>If you could wish for something what would it be??</FONT> I'm not sure what I would wish for.. hmm.. </P>
<P>Right now, I love so many people. Right now I hate certain people. The people / person I hate thinks they are the best thing that happened on this Earth. He / She thinks people can't live without them well NEW FLASH! we can. In fact, just go away!! This town doesn't need you. </P>
<P>My friends and I are sorta planning to go to see Spider Man 2. Oh yeah, tonight at Magnolia we all applied heh silly.. Tonight we saw Cinderella Story starring Hillary Duff, and Chad Michael Murray. HE'S DEFINITELY HOTT! I would recommend that movie. I like Hillary, and Chad.. yumm! </P>
<P>Well, I must go because tomorrow is starting another week. I don't even know what I'm doing online, seriously. But, whatever. Working again all this week, hopefully taking&nbsp;tuesday off or something, to go beaching. ;) Well, done for now. cya! </P>"

She had been at bubs house for a couple of hours, but then she decided to come to my house by skateboard. Great choice, only ir was thundering, but it never ended up raining. Good for Morgan!! So, for dinner we had Chicken Fried Rice...YUM! It's my favorite rice.&nbsp; OH YEAH I LOST FOUR LBS!! I'm happy see :) Well, anyway after dinner we rode bikes. Included was Morgan, mom, and I. It was vigerous.. ( spelled correctly? ) After that, Morg and I went back to her house so she can change, and her mom took us to Blockbuster. She was on her way to a resturant so she just waited for a few minutes and out we came. Thankfully she dropped us off at my house, since Morgan didn't wanna walk. It's ok, I still love you!! Anyway at Blockbuster we rented a movie called,""Swimming Pool."" I watched it with Kristina and decided, why not just show it to Morgan. Well, in the beginning it's pretty boring, but trust me it get very interesting. Also, while this watching the movie was going on, my dad two CD's of Morgans. YAY! Thanks Morg. One was Dan's Mix. And the other was Taking Back Sunday. When she comes back I'm going to burn Brand New. I listened to one and a half songs as she was changing and stuff so, it was pretty coo. Sorry Morg, not listening to it tonight, but I promise tomorrow night. Hey Morg, Me n Peter this saturday YES! Anyway, she left at about 11:15pm. Now, I'm online. I got to talk to Lyle today. Pretty coo. Tomorrow, I might chill with Kristina during the day nd then Renee at night. Haven't seen Renee since the last day at school because she went to New York, and I'm going in a week. Well, I'm going to go from here. Update when I can. C-ya. </P>"

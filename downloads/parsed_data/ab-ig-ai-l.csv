"event","Canada was kool...i mean, it got kinda boring after a while coz really, how many  times can you look at water falling over rock? But anyway...It was pretty cool, i was supposed to be like super grounded but my parents are like totally wrapped so i ended up having my mom get me $120 worth of perfume.

I ended up having some really wierd dreams too....like in one of them i hooked up with justin lange, i know i know its gross.

I wish my vacation was earlier, so i wouldnt have missed out on the cast party, but what can you do?

Im really bad at golf...

Oh and i drove on a major highway.......it was really scary, but it wasnt too bad.

"event","ok so i haven't been on in a little while...well, I'm both happy and sad that the shows are coming to an end. I'm happy because i get time to do whatever i feel like, and i'm sad because i shall miss seeing everyone, especially all those who are leaving for college, But we all gotta get on with our lives. Mr. walton came to see the show and it was cool because he's like my favouritest teacher ever, hooray.

"event","ok so, the carnival was...boring as it always is, and i saw people that i didn't necessarily want to talk to, but it was cool. i was forced to ride the green spinny thing that spins with cody and ian, i thought i was gonna throw up the entire time, so none the less i didnt attempt to ride any more rides. the night wasnt completely horrible, i won a fish, but sadly it died this morning and that made me sad...it was a stupid fish anyway.

i think i might go back again just to see ppl...but maybe not"

"event","Okay so, i've been told, by some random person that i should actually try to update this thingy...so...um...here goes, so today, i slept in until 11 as usual, and i was like, crap...i have to do set construction, dude this means i actually have to get up and shower...so i did, and it was cool, but then i forgot that i ate... i tend to do that, so i went to subway. So i should up and i realized I like hitting things, so megan megan and i got to hit pieces of wood with hammers and it was super cool. then i did like other obscure jobs, soooo that was cool, i thought i'd see other ppl there but alas...no. so then ian and sara came to pick me up and i was suprised coz...u no....seeing exes is hard and i totally didnt get shot gun which made me feel unspecial but, hey what can you do? so i got over it. 

so we all contemplated on what to do. We sat and decided that having a movie night at saras would be mildly entertaining....but alas....to many ppl were busy so we ended up just chillin at saras and it was a tad bit akward, only coz i kinda felt like a third wheel so yea that kinda sucked but i got over it. It was cool tho, i found out that saras mom is very open about sex and what not, and, well, when your parents are hard core conservative, it's alittle shocking to hear such words from a parents mouth, so that cool. and um then ian took me home and i got bitched at again for another worthless reason...but whatever....cool i think im done....

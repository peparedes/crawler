I apologize for the lack of any kind of update. I don't even know how many of you still check your pages but if you do...

<center><font size=+3><b>VIVIENNE
IS
HERE!!!!!!</font></b></center>

True, it's been over two weeks almost but we're finally out of the damned hospital and we're home~ Home where she can meet her big brother and sister and her extended family. I expect visits and fawning, she deserves it and she's perfect. I can't stand to put her down for a minute...much to Mao's disapproval. He'll have to deal.

Vivi looks just like her father, including that constant pout we've grown to tolerate and love. *smiles* It was the most painful thing I've ever been through but she's so worth it. <small><s>maybe I'm nuts enough for one more</s></small>

You've all died on me, wake up and watch Mao turn into a complete sappy puddle of happy daddy and never let him live it down. *laughs*"

"event","I'm okay. In a manner of speaking, the pain is better but the doctor says everything is okay. It was Braxton Hicks with a little pain caused by stress. Oops. Vivi is alright and continues to kick and move around and fuss until she hears Mao's voice or he puts his face to my stomach. I'm drugged to hell and back most of the time, the rest of the time I'm lucid enough to want out of this place.

I will admit I was terrified as hell. I thought I was losing my baby or something. There was nothing scarier than that.

And then the drugs kicked in and caused me to pass out and interrupt yesterday's post until today.

I'm feeling better, stronger. Hopefully, I can go home soon. I just want my own bed and Masako and Mao. And I want <i>real</i> food. I'm starving here.



I owe you a very big apology, Mao."

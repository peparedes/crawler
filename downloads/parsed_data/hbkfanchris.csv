"event","Hey everybody, I'm back, but not to rant this time. I have news... nay, not just news, good news. In fact, super-dee-mother-fucking-dooper news! On Saturday I am going to be meeting one of the fine gentlemen who runs the Squared Circle training gym in Toronto before their show, then on Sunday I will be checking out their new facilities. But that's not even the best part. Assuming nothing goes awry between now and then, I will begin training there the first weekend in July! Oh, and as if that wasn't enough, there's more! It looks like we (my dad, his gf and I) have found a place in Bowmanville for the start of August. So if we end up renting the house there, I will be: a) out of Port Hope; and b) able to go up to Toronto for all 4 classes a week at the gym. The only way this week could get any better is if I win the friggin' jackpot on the 649 tonight. So, for all my peeps out there in the P-Dot-H, we'd better get together at some point in time for a going away shindig, and of course you can visit me after I move. And, if you're not one of my peeps, why the hell are you reading this? Well? Consider that, and move along. I'm outtie for now, have a great day, and damn the man!"

"event","First and foremost, my condolences to the family of Const. Chris Garrett. I don't think I really need to explain that, anyone who reads my lj will have most likely have heard of the situation. There, now that's out of the way. So I was gonna write this as a letter to the Port Hope Evening Guide, but I figured I'd rather just rant in my lj because, well, I got incredibly sick of using organized formats when I was at school (one of the many reasons I now work in a Petro-Canada and will be [and I say this with 98.3% certainty, not sure but very damn close] in wrestling school by November). Anyways, I was looking at the newspapers at work (as I so often do since I usually have time to at very least study the headlines) and I noticed that all 4 of the major Canadian newspapers (well, if you count the Post as major) had the new provincial budget on the front page. To get this out of the way, yes, I am a very left-wing person, but this argument isn't really about politics, it's about fairness. Now, if you don't really follow either the media or politics, or both (not that there's anything wrong with that, some people just don't find either interesting, but I do) both the Sun and the Post are right-wing (or conservative-sided [think Republican if you're in the states]), where Globe & Mail and the Star are more left-wing (think liberal or Democratic party). Now, the Star and Globe had, in my opinion, fair coverings of the new budget. Yes, they covered the fact that taxes were going up, that the Liberals (the party in power in Ontario, if you weren't sure) had made promises about not raising taxes without the consent of the voters, and that the Liberals would be running a deficit, contrary to election promises. The Sun and Post both also hit these points. However, that's pretty much where the story ended for both of those papers, and the rest of their coverage turned into one-sided editorials/commentaries slamming the Liberals, including on the Sun, a front page headline calling the Liberals ""bald-faced liars"", and the Post claimed, again as front page news, that the Liberal budget was a ""triumph for the culture of deceit"". If you think I'm exaggerating, I've got a copy of the Post here beside me while I type this, and I wrote down that quote from the Sun while I was at work (we sold out of the Sun before I thought to buy one). Unlike the right-wing papers, the Globe and Star actually bothered to report on why the Liberals raised taxes (and yes, they had a reason, a damn good one, Mister Andrew Coyne [National Post], you shit-talking sorry excuse for a journalist, commentary or not). Taxes went up so that $2.4 billion could be pumped into the health care system, and another $2.1 billion could go into the education system (from the Toronto Star). One should also note that, the Liberals are going to be running a $2.2 billion deficit. However, when they promised that they wouldn't run a deficit, they didn't know that they would be inheriting a $5.6 billion deficit from the departing Conservative party. Think about that, do the math. I'm not saying that some of the blame shouldn't rest on the shoulders of Dalton McGuinty and the Liberals, yes, they are breaking serious promises. However, a huge chunk of that blame should rest on the shoulders of Mike Harris, Ernie Eves and the Tories. They plundered the education and health systems of this province, and lost money. But that's not the point of this rant. The point is that a fair and balanced report on the budget would include not just the facts, but the reasons behind them. Let me break it down like this: as my one teacher used to explain, there are 3 levels of reporting: basic, where it's just restating the most basic of the facts; then there's the next level, where all of the obvious facts are given, but there's no backstory given, no reasons or logic stated; then there's the third level, where all the facts are given, and all of the logic and reasons are given and explained. The ONLY way to have a fair, accurate and objective view of a story is to see reporting that is done in that third level. Neither the Sun nor the Post did that. Hell, they barely hit level 2. I'm not writing this because my political views are different than those of the Sun or Post, I'm more left-wing than the Globe or Star too, and would be jumping all over them just as bad if I thought they were guilty of this. Reporting like this makes me sick. These are supposed to be respected newspapers, but I can honestly say that they are either making mistakes that myself and my former classmates knew better than to make after a MONTH of classes, or they are allowing their opinions to influence their reporting in a way that should NEVER be allowed in a non-editorial column. Grrrr. Glad I got that all out. In other news, had a great time tonight, Shrek 2 kicks all kinds of ass, as does sitting in Tim Hortons talking for hours and hours. Well, I think I've done enough for tonight. Have a nice day (bang bang!). Oh, and I'm not giving you a poem tonight, because my entry is plenty long as is. Peace out"

"event","It's been awhile, so here I am, you damn dirty apes. Yeah, I called you all damn dirty apes, deal with it. I'm on a bit of a downer, or I would be if I hadn't just ruptured my spleen from laughing so hard at the Daily Show (I can't believe they got Zulu to say ""bitches""!). But I was supposed to go up to Belleville to visit Raquel, unfortunately due to events beyond anyones control, it had to be postponed. So now I'm not sure what's up this weekend. But shit happens, and it could be worse. But let's not dwell on that. I really feel like I should be ranting about George W Bush trying to amend the constitution to say that marriage is only a union between a man and a woman, but I feel as though I've beaten that horse to death (if only I could do that to Bush as well *sigh*). But by now anyone who reads this should know my stance on that subject. So I won't say anymore. Well, I guess that's it for now, you brain-dead ignorami. Oh, and one last thing, if you didn't know, my heart is made of crystal, and here's my latest poem... I wrote it a few weeks ago, but it's still the newest thing I've written. Peace y'all.

Untitled

Am I doomed to stand alone,
Broken hearts and broken homes,
Left behind in my path,
A walking storm's aftermath,
Happiness found only to be lost,
Like roses killed by early frost,
An existence of pain, no other choice,
My soul cries out, but without voice,
It's not heeded and I carry forth,
The pain like a wind from the north,
I prostrate myself before the open sky,
Praying for the end, but I do not die,
And so, forsaken, I live on,
My only joy has come and gone,
Thus I lay down, now all too sane,
And await the end of this pain.

"event","Here I sit, all broken hearted, came to... oh sorry, thought I was vandalizing a bathroom stall, my bad. Anyways, I'm here, writing this, not because I care, no! but because, well, I'm bored outta my skull. So I'm going to talk about the only thing I feel like talking about right now. I was reading the Sunday Sun (no, not just the back page... jackasses), and I read an interesting letter, where the tactics used by George W. Bush and the American government in in attacking Iraq were compared to those used by Hitler when he invaded Poland. Now, as interesting as the letter was, there is a huge fallacy in that logic. See, while Iraq could have conceivably attacked neighbouring countries, and Saddam Hussein is guilty of unspeakable crimes against the citizens of his own country, nothing like that happened in Poland. There are (I just saw the funniest commercial, I'll tell when I'm done ranting) other such things that make the logic full of holes, but when you just look at the way both parties lied about the places they invaded, trying to make it look like it was an act of self-preservation... well, it was kinda scary. Anyways, the commercial I just saw was a Blue Light commercial. This chick and a bear are celebrating V-day, and she gives him a gift, then he gives her what looks like a a big long box with a goalie mask on top of it. But (and this is what's so great!) it was really a giant Pez-dispenser-like apparatus, filled with cans of beer! If I had one of those, well, I'd drink more beer, that's for sure! Man, that bear is a true player, let me tell you what! Anyway, I figured I'd pop another poem on the end of this post, even though this one was long enough to stand on its own. So just count your blessings dipwads, here comes another brilliant piece of crap! (I know, the contradictions of that statement will keep all of you thinking for a little while)

What Never Was

I miss thinking of you everyday,
I miss the way I longed for you,
I miss fantasizing about you and me,
I miss listening to all your problems,
I miss the way you look when you laugh,
I miss the butterflies in my stomach when you looked at me,
I miss being sad when you were sad,
I even miss you breaking my heart,
I never knew how much I'd miss,
Something that never was.

Some of it was hard to watch just because it was so powerful, especially the stuff when they were little kids, just because I feel so strongly about what should be done to people who do such things to children (i.e.: they should be lined up and beaten to death with a fire hose... that's right, a fire hose. Any questions?) But the movie was amazing, Kelso- erm, I mean Kutcher, impressed me. And Amy Smart is hot. So yeah, I gave y'all a poem yesterday, you can wait for the next entry for another one.

The Cross That I Bear

How often I've wished that life was fair,
That we didn't have to carry these crosses we bear,
But when I'm with you I feel like my burdens are lifted,
My heart feels strengthened, my spirit shifted,
To happy from sad, to joy from sorrow,
My one wish as I sleep is to see you tomorrow,
And everyday thereafter, from now 'til forever,
My feelings for you nothing could sever,
Be it time or distance, there's nothing I won't do,
If it means when it's over, I'll be there with you,
And so I give you these words, but they're just the start,
For everyday from now on, I'll give you my heart.

All That's Left

It seems like whenever I close my eyes,
I think about you,
It doesn't matter how hard I try,
Or that I don't want to.

Every time I go to bed,
And turn out my light,
I start seeing your face,
And I'm up all night.

I know I need to forget you,
And just move on.
But I missed you so much,
When you were gone,

And now that you're back,
You're still so far away.
I have no problem forgetting you,
During the day.

But late at night,
While I lie in bed,
It's these visions of you,
That run through my head.

I'm still in love with you,
I hope it doesn't show,
I have to keep it trapped inside,
I can't let anyone know,

Because we can't be together,
This I know is true,
So all that's left for me,
Is to try and be happy for you.

Addiction

It's been three months now since I've touched your lips,
Three months since I've tasted the salt of your skin,
Since I've felt the passion burning inside of you,
And I'm yearning for that feeling again,
I need to feel the warmth of your body against mine,
I want to cry out that I'm sorry and that you were right,
Even though I know you aren't here to hear me,
I want to make love to you once more,
But you've left me like a junkie with no fix,
And my addiction haunts me every night,
Killing my heart like some nefarious drug,
And I know that this need for you won't leave me,
Not in three months, or three years, or three lifetimes,
It will never leave me,
Because you have.

Chris Murray, 2002"

"event","I find it a little ironic that this is the first entry since my last entry, if you get my message. Well, you probably don't yet, but it might make sense before I'm done. If it doesn't, well, tough shit, ask me later. I walked into this evening with my head in the clouds, now it feels more like my heart is six feet under (hence the subject line). I hurt, man. I hurt bad. If someone walked up to me right now and handed me a pill and said ""Take this and you'll forget all about it, never even remember anything happened""... well, let's just say I'd be pretty damn tempted. If that seems a bit much to anyone, well, this is my writing, and this is how I feel, fuck you very much if you don't like it. Sorry, but I have some residual anger going on right now. And that's not even the half of it. Anger, sadness, a tiny, tiny bit of happiness (it's pretty minimal though), helplessness, regret, self-loathing, and this gaping feeling of emptiness. I can't explain how I feel, other than it feels bad. The worst part (besides the emptiness) is the helplessness, because I hate that feeling. I hate knowing that there's nothing I can do to make my life the way I want it to be. Whether or not it's my fault directly, or just the roll of the dice, I don't know. I need to move on, but it's hard. Good night friends, and have a pleasant tomorrow, I'll see you then."

As my super-cool subject line says, I got nothing to say, but I'm bored, so here I am. I just found out something reasonably cool: indy wrestler CM Punk has a livejournal account! Cool beans, eh? Since 99.2% of the people who read this have no knowledge of wrestling, I'll just say this: Punk is a really good wrestler who works for NWA-TNA and Ring of Honor, among other indy promotions. So if you wanna read his lj, hit it up. The user name is cmpunk (makes sense, eh?). Well, now that I'm done giving a cheap plug to some dude who isn't aware of my existence, I'll move on to something else... or, I would if I had something to talk about. Oh, I know! Why does fate enjoy fucking with my mind? Seriously here folks, I know I mentioned to a few of you about a contest thing that the wrestling school I visited this past April (www.squaredcircletraining.com) is having a contest for a free try-out. Now, although I'm not totally sure what they mean by try-out, I was very excited. I tried to go to the other website to get more details, and... nothing. Why, may you ask? Because I'm me, that's why!!! Man, even when I'm lucky I can't catch a break. Ah well... I got this really cool idea for a tattoo. I was thinking at the base of my neck/between my shoulders, a falcon/hawk/raven/other cool bird with it's wings stretched out so that the tips just touch my shoulder blades, and the beak rests just below where a shirt collar would be. I personally think it would look bitchin' cool, and could easily be covered by a t-shirt... problem is, tattoos are fucking expensive! So, if anyone wants to get me a really, really extravagant gift, hit me up with a trip to the tattoo parlour. Well, I think I've wasted enough of everyone's time, I'm outtie."

As per usual, I haven't been sleeping well lately, but I'm not worried. Once I get into the busy life of a college student I should either: a) be tired enough by the time I go to bed that I'll sleep; or b) not be sleeping when I go to bed, if you catch my gutter-minded intent. I was watching Smackdown, and I'm only going to say one thing about the show: why the hell wasn't Chris Benoit in the match for the #1 contendership? Seriously, what twisted mind puts the Big Show and Undertaker in that match, but makes Benoit pick up a cheap win over Albert? What the fuck? (Hey, I think that's the first time I've said fuck in my lj! Hey, that was the second!) I just pray that Paul Heyman becomes head writer again someday, so that he can right the wrongs perpetrated by those poorly-trained jerkoffs (AKA the WWE creative team). And one last wrestling comment: should Bill Goldberg win the World Heavyweight title at Unforgiven, I will not watch Raw until he drops the belt. Yes, I was the drunk guy cheering when Triple H crushed him with a sledgehammer at SummerSlam. If you don't like it, feel free to kiss my ass. Anyway, I'm back from that little tangent. I move on Sunday morning! Finally, I will leave this little crap-hole behind and move on to bigger and better things! And it's nice to know my family has faith in me too. In fact, my dad already told me I'm to buy him a TR-6 when I get rich. Granted, I don't think too many journalists make enough money to afford one of those for themselves, let alone their old man... ah well, guess I'll just have to keep starring in adult films and running drugs to pay the bills.

"event","That's right kids! Here it is! The inaugural PPV preview, courtesy of me, Chris Murray! So, let's just dive headfirst into this bad boy, shall we?
Dudley Boyz vs La Resistance, World Tag Team Titles- first and foremost, as much as I LOVE watching La Resistance piss off american fans, they really shouldn't be holding the titles. Both Grenier and Dupree have incredible talent and potential (especially Dupree), they simply weren't ready to have the belts so soon. Hell, Dupree is my age for christ sakes! The Dudleys, however, have the experience necessary to make something of the belts, and it would be the great american patriotic moment for them to beat those french(-canadian) bastards all over the arena. Therefore, my pick is the Dudleys.
RVD vs Kane- no chance of RVD stopping Kane. I predict some insane high-risk offence from RVD (praying for a Van Terminator!), but in the end, the Big Red Retard, erm Machine, is gonna hit a tombstone and get the win.
A-Train vs 'Taker- this will actually be a pretty good match. Undertaker will win, because let's be honest, when was the last time he jobbed at a ppv? But, when you take the experience and psychology of the Dead Man, and the surprising athleticism of A-Train, it stands a very good chance of surpassing 'Taker/Cena.
Guerrero vs Rhyno vs Benoit vs Tajiri- match of the night, it's that simple. 4 guys who are just plain awesome, and they're gonna kick the crap outta each other. I have no idea who's gonna win, but I hope it's not Benoit. I say this not because I dislike him, because he's one of my favourite wrestlers, but because he deserves to be wrestling Angle and Lesnar for the WWE title. If I have to make a pick for this match, it's Eddie lying, cheating, and stealing his way to victory (note, I wouldn't mind getting that shirt for Christmas).
Matt Hardy vs Zach Gowen- it's gonna be Matt. I like watching either of these guys, and Gowen can do some amazing things for a normal wrestler, not even considering the fact that he has one leg! But I don't see his first ever win coming against Matt Hardy. I'm not totally sure on this one, but I doubt Gowen will pull it out cleanly. Maybe a stolen victory, but I'm still picking Hardy.
Eric Bischoff vs Shane McMahon- Shane all the way. I'm just aching to see that bitchin elbow off the top through the announce table. After all, the first time he did that was SummerSlam. I see no way for Bischoff to pull out the win, I just hope they keep this one short & sweet, 'cause every time I see Bischoff on TV, I want to throw a brick through my screen! I'm sorry, but he's just that annoying! And not because he's supposed to be, but because he sucks! Seriously, who really wanted to see that whole thing with Linda McMahon monday night? Ewwwww...
Angle vs Lesnar, WWE title- I'm picking Angle. Someone needs to beat Brock straight up, one on one, and Angle is the man for the job. It'll be a classic, no doubt, possibly even better than WrestleMania since Kurt won't have to worry about the neck as much. I just hope Brock remembers to go to the near corner for the Shooting Star, should he bust it out. I don't want to see that bump EVER AGAIN! It reminds me of Hayabusa too much... now that was a tragedy... alright, I'm back. To summarize, awesome, awesome match, Angle retains.
Elimination Chamber- Jericho! Jericho! Jericho! It's gonna be Jericho! Seriously, who else? Triple H needs to take some time away from the belt. I'm not saying this because I dislike the Game, I'm actually a fan. But he's hurt, and keeps getting hurt because he keeps pushing himself. He needs some rest. Orton? Not ready for the belt. Let him get a few runs after the IC title, get a little more experience. Hell, he's young, he's got all the time in the world. HBK? Hey, he's my all time favourite, and I'll go abso-freakin-lutely NUTS if he wins, but I don't see it happening. The belt should go to someone who can work everyday, and sadly, that ain't Michaels. Nash? Someday maybe, but I just don't see it happening Sunday night. Goldberg? He doesn't even deserve to be in the match. The prima donna, Bret-Hart-career-killing bastard (bonus points to anyone who remembers that!) doesn't even work house shows! (I know, neither does Michaels, but he has that whole ""broken back"" excuse) Not to mention the fact that Goldberg has been getting crapped on all over the place, and putting the belt on someone totally unstoppable is a very bad idea. Think about it: who would beat him? If he goes into the Chamber, no sells everything, and beats everyone easy, where do you go from there? The problem with making everyone you wrestle look weak and crappy (and that's what he does, because no one but Goldberg goes over even a little in his matches) is that it makes it look like no one can touch you. If no one can touch you, then no one can ever beat you for the belt, making every single match incredibly predictable. I only hope the WWE doesn't resign his useless ass when his contract is up.
Anyway, to conclude, Jericho, Angle, Guerrero, Shane O'Mac, Matt Hardy, Undertaker, Kane, and the Dudleys all leave happy, and hopefully so will I. That's it for me, see you at SummerSlam!"

"event","Hey all, what's kickin? I don't really have any set plans on what I'm going to write, other than it will include a new Top 5 List. First things first, I have had the most screwed-up time sleeping as of late. Not falling asleep until insanely late, waking up in the middle of the night for an hour at a time... it's all messed up. But that's not really interesting. What I do find interesting, however, is all the uproar about gay marriage lately (yeah, here comes a rant, brace yourselves). Now, as a heterosexual male, I'm a little worried about this. I mean, they must be forcing people to marry members of the same sex, right? Why else would anyone give a damn? (Bonus points to anyone who knew I ripped that off from the Daily Show) Seriously, I don't understand. Some people say that gay marriages weaken the foundation of the institution of marriage. How? If two people love each other and are committed to each other, how can that weaken marriage? Gay people aren't damaging the concept of marriage, people who don't take marriage seriously, who fool around on their spouses, who get divorced and remarried and divorced again and remarried again in a perpetual cycle, these are the people who damage the institution of marriage! Not that I believe divorce should be outlawed or anything foolish like that, but that's not my point. If a minister/rabbi/priest has no problem marrying the two individuals, who the hell are we to interfere? So some christians believe it to be a sin to be gay. Didn't it use to be a mortal sin to eat meat on the Sabbath? Times change people! The bible wasn't written yesterday! Hell, for all anyone knows, Jesus could've been gay! Think about it: travels around with his 12 male friends (or 13, depending on if you believe Dogma), consorts with prostitutes but NEVER gets laid... I'm just saying, it's possible. Anyway, I think everyone now knows my views on this subject. And now for something a bit less serious (actually, way less serious), today's Top 5 List. On today's list, I shall be counting down the 5 women I'm most attracted to but have never met. And just to explain something now, I'm not going to include the ones that every guy thinks is hot, like Britney Spears or Pamela Anderson. Those are givens. Also, to any wrestling fans out there, I'm not going to include female wrestlers Tracy Brooks or Angel (not that they aren't totally hot, they are, especially Ms. Brooks!), because I've met them both. HA! In your face, any Canadian indy wrestling fan out there! Also, they aren't in any order, as that changes pretty much any time I see them. Here we go:
1) Mya (she's a total fox, need I say more?)
2) Michelle Branch (talented with a nice body and a brain. What more could a guy want?)
3) Amanda Walsh from MuchMusic (hey, she might annoy some people, but not me. I'm too intoxicated by her great looks.)
4) Gail Kim (if canadian girls are hot, and asian girls are hot, what can you say about an asian-canadian chick, especially one who can do a hurricanrana?)
5) Mandy Moore (so what if I hate her music, she's still hot!)
Well, that's all for me kids. Have a nice day, bang bang!!!! (Foley is god!)"

Note to Kevin: you and Laura figure out a time that's good for the two of you, and get back to me (hehehe). And today was a day for just lazing around, which was very good. I just hung out, made some soup, watched a bit of TV, and wrestling, of course. I have decided that Randy Orton is one of the 5 luckiest guys in the world. The guy's barely older than my brother, and he gets to main event SummerSlam! Sure, he won't win the World Title, but still, being in your early 20's and working with guys like Jericho, Michaels, Triple H, and, of course, Ric Flair (Wooo!)... that's pretty much my dream in a nutshell. But I digress, that's not what this is about... actually, I don't really have anything else to talk about, some I'm going to keep talking about wrestling. Vicki, Nette, stop reading now, you won't care about anything past this point. I can't wait to see Angle vs Lesnar at SummerSlam, especially since Lesnar is a heel again. The only thing that would make it better is having Paul Heyman in his corner instead of Vince McMahon. Speaking of McMahon's, I hope Shane O busts out something wild and crazy on Eric Bischoff. Maybe the elbow off the top through the spanish announce table? Man, I can't wait until I get my chance to top that bump (and I will). But nothing will ever top the 40-foot elbow drop onto the Big Show. Anyways, getting back on track, there's the Elimination Chamber match. It will either be amazing, or mind-blowingly crappy, absolutely no middle ground on that one. Here's my question for the day: can anyone tell me why neither Chris Benoit nor Eddie Guerrero have held the WWE championship yet? They are two of the best wrestlers in the business today, if not ever, yet neither of them have held that belt. Next time they put the belt on The Rock or someone like that, I'd love to see Benoit shoot on them and steal the gold. That would be awesome beyond belief. In fact, it would totally reek of awesomeness! In fact, if Goldberg wins the Elimination Chamber (god forbid) then Benoit should shoot on him, make him look like a total assclown, then take the belt. Ah yes, my brilliant plans, they're always so great on paper. Ah well... I should be stopping writing now. Not that I couldn't go on talking about wrestling mind you, I just don't really feel like it right now. G'night everybody, and have a nice day!"

I could go to the bar, but last call is in about 5 minutes, so that's no good. I could go for a walk, but that'd just be odd at 2 in the morning. Besides, the only place to walk to in this town is Tim Hortons, and caffeine is the last thing I need right now. I could watch a movie or some wrestling matches, but I don't feel like just laying around either. What a predicament. Maybe I should just lie down and try to drift off to sleep. Maybe I'll dream. Then again, I kinda hope I don't dream. Usually my dreams (when I remember them, which isn't all that often) don't make any sense, but when they do, they tend to be unpleasant. Not nightmares, just dreams that aren't really that fun. But I digress. It's now past last call. I'm just gonna try to get some sleep. If that doesn't work, maybe I'll try to write something. I was going to write a letter for the opinion page of the local newspaper, but I'm not really in a ranting kind of mood right now. Well, that's all for tonight kids. But don't worry, when I'm in that ranting kind of mood, everyone who reads this will be the first to know. Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow."

"event","Yeah, it's Thursday. Wrestling was on, but there was really nothing worth mentioning about it. I went and saw Sarah at work. That was... let's go with awkward... yeah, awkward works. I'm beginning to worry that I have serious insomnia. Last night I couldn't fall asleep until after 2am. Usually it's either that or I fall asleep around midnight, but wake up at 3 and can't get back to sleep for another hour or so. This morning I was still awake when my dad's alarm clock went off at 5. Maybe I should start sedating myself before bed. *grabs bottle of NyQuil* Yeah, that'll do the trick. Although the plus side to not being able to fall asleep is it gives a great time for writing. Last night I began work on a new literary piece. I'm not specifying what form of writing it'll be, because, to be honest, I'm not sure yet. It's a little disturbing to read though, which bothers me a little for two reasons. One; I wasn't going for disturbing, I was going for sad. Two; it's way too accurate, I don't like to think that my imagination is warped enough to disturb me so. Anyways, I'm gonna stop writing now before I scare you all. Good night."

"event","Good evening ladies and gentlemen, it is I, Chris Murray! And I'm bored off my friggin skull! There is pretty much nothing new with me, so instead of writing about nothing, I'm going to give everyone some deep insight into the mind of one of the greatest thinkers of all time (for those of you who're about as quick on the uptake as Dubya, that's me). Yes, I'm going to reveal some of my top 5 lists. 
First off, I'll hit everyone with my Top 5 Movies list. As I love all of these movies so much, they are in no particular order.
1: Dogma
2: High Fidelity (bonus points to anyone who knew that this movie was where I stole the idea for top 5 lists)
3: Empire Records
4: Ferris Bueller's Day Off
5: Blues Brothers (the original, not to be confused with Blues Brothers 2000 *shudder*)
Next up we have my Top 5 Musicians/Bands list. Again, no particular order.
1: Metallica (I was at Summer Sanitarium! WooHOO!)
2: Rage Against The Machine/Sound Garden/Audioslave (all 3 are great, and have become one since the inception of Audioslave)
3: The Ramones
4: Saliva
5: AC/DC
Now we come to the wrestling part of the list (hey Ikivic, I know you'll make a rude comment, so cake to you). This is my Top 5 Wrestlers list, and it is in order.
5: Eddie Guerrero
4: (tie) Bret and Owen Hart 
3: Chris Benoit
2: Chris Jericho
1: Shawn Michaels
Next up, the Top 5 Matches of all time.
5: Last Man Standing, Fully Loaded 2000, Triple H over Chris Jericho.
4: Ladder Match, SummerSlam 1995, Shawn Michaels over Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental championship.
3: Ladder Match, Royal Rumble 2001, Chris Jericho over Chris Benoit for the WWF Intercontinental championship.
2: Ultimate Submission, Backlash 2001, Chris Benoit over Kurt Angle.
1: Iron Man, Wrestlemania 12, Shawn Michaels over Bret Hart for the WWF championship.
Note: honourable mentions go to any match from Japan featuring a Dungeon graduate, especially those featuring Ultimo Dragon or Jushin Liger, and any match between Bret and Owen Hart.
Well, that's it for tonight. I have more lists, but I figure I'll save them for another night when I have nothing to write (holy crap, that rhymes!). So, in closing, I must tell you all this: if you ain't down with my lists, I've just got 2 words for ya... S**K IT!!! (Yay DX! WooHOO!) G'night everybody!"

"event","Hey kids, I'm back. I just finished watching Raw, and I'm ecstatic! No, not because Shane O'Mac got tombstoned, not because RVD and Chris Jericho had an awesome match, not even because Scott Steiner jobbed to Randy Orton (although that was nice, I must admit). No, I'm happy because it's no longer Triple H and Goldberg one-on-one at SummerSlam... it's now an Elimination Chamber match, featuring H, Goldbrick, Nash, Orton, and my two personal favourites, Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels! WooHOO! This could very easily be a great match, depending on two things. One: how long Kevin Nash stays in the match. I'm sorry, but Nash simply doesn't move well enough to hang with the best anymore, and unlike someone like Undertaker, he doesn't have the psychology to quite make up for it, although Nash certainly isn't the worst for it either (I'm pointing at you two, Steiner and Goldberg). The second factor is whether or not Goldberg sells for ANYONE during the match. I'm sorry, but when you no-sell everything from Ric Flair's chops to a friggin steel chair, you upset me. Bill Goldberg is an atrocious wrestler who doesn't even deserve to wash the jock straps of wrestlers like Jericho, Michaels, or Triple H, let alone get in the ring with them at SummerSlam. Believe me, I will discuss my dislike of Goldberg again on another occasion (or two... or seventy-three), but for now I'll leave that subject alone. Today was just another day for me, nothing new or exciting taking place, but hey, I'm used to that. I did, however, see two things that really got under my skin. One was a Gap commercial, the other was an ad from MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving). As I was channel surfing this aft, I saw a Gap commercial featuring... Madonna? WTF? I've never been a fan of hers, but at least before I had a shred of respect for her. But what the hell? She just releases that American Life song (or whatever it was called, I'm not sure) that totally rips on the whole idea of americanization, and then here she is dancing around singing about her nice new jeans from the Gap! Can you say sell-out children? I knew you could(Bonus points to anyone who actually said it out loud)! Secondly, this ad from MADD. Normally I have the utmost respect and appreciation for this organization, as they have done a lot of work towards preventing drunk driving (by the way, anyone reading this who drives drunk, slam your head off your computer desk a few times, you're an idiot). However, I can't help but notice how so many of their ads have begun to focus on the issue of young people driving drunk. Let me remind everyone of something; in Canada (I'm assuming this is true in the States and elsewhere too, but I'm not sure) young people have the lowest rate of drunk driving out of any age group! The worst offenders tend to be in the 40+ age group, not in the 25 and under! Will someone please explain to me why one would focus on the group who is the least likely to drink and drive? Oh yeah, because everyone wants to blame the kids! AAARRRGGGHHHH!!! Wow... my first real full-out ranting on lj.com... I feel so calm now... man, I'm gonna stop before I start talking about Goldberg some more. Remember, peace, love and... a steel chair to the face! E-C-Dub, E-C-Dub!!! I'm out!"

"event","Well, it's Sunday. Last night was Vicki's party... I found it to be quite amusing. I was kinda looking forward to seeing what Nick would be like drunk, but alas, he only had 2 drinks. Matt downed the most, throwing back I think 7 Smirnoff Triple Black, not too shabby at all. Me, I downed most of a bottle of cherry whiskey, and amazingly, have no symptoms of a hangover. It kinda sucked that Nette, Nadine, Kevin and Ashley had to bail so early, but it happens. Anyway, it's now 2:30, so I am fully awake (or as close to that as I ever get). On a side note, bread simply is not as good as buns when it comes to hamburgers. I learned this earlier this afternoon when, after frying myself a burger (mmmmmmm, burgers *drool), I realized that all of the hamburger buns were moldy. So I had to settle for bread, and when you're eating a nice, greasy burger with melted cheese, bbq sauce, and honey mustard... well, let's just say that bread doesn't really hold up to that kind of mess like a bun does. Ah well, live and learn... or not, whatever. I also learned that the movie Empire Records (one of my top 5 of all time, to be sure) is just as great to watch drunk as it is sober. Extreme bonus points to anyone out there who loves that movie as much as I do. And, as a message to any of my fellow wrestling fans, if you want to watch and amazing wrestling match, download Great Muta vs Hiroshi Hase, NJPW from 1992. Great match, a good 20 minutes, maybe a little longer, but be warned, it gets bloody. I'm talking Muta bleeds so much I think they probably had to mop up the ring after the match, it was sick. Anyways, that's all for today. And just remember, like it or not, you might as well learn to love it, 'cause it's the greatest thing going baby! WOOOOO! (Thank you Nature Boy!)"

"event","Well ladies and gentlemen, I have finally arrived! Now, for those of you who don't know me, I am Chris Murray, your new hero, your party host, and most importantly, the most charismatic showman to ever enter your homes via a computer screen! Ok, so I just totally ripped Y2J off on that intro, but dammit he's cool! Anyways, this is my first appearance on lj.com, and I'm just gonna let everybody know a few things about me. First off: there will be many, many wrestling references used in my journal entries, just like the one above. If you understand them, then bonus points for you! If not, just smile and nod, 'cause if I have to start explaining wrestling to people, we're gonna be here all damn day. Secondly: I like music. Specifically, loud music. Angry loud music. Punk and metal mostly, with a little power-pop thrown in for good measure. However, I despise Fred Durst. His name will never again be mentioned in this journal. Speaking of people I despise, you know that guy who looks kinda like a monkey? I can't remember his name... he's from Texas, his dad helped him sneak his way into office... he started a war over oil... oh yeah, Dubya! I will make mention of him, because, to be blunt, I really enjoy putting the diss to that assclown. Just to please the authority figures, I am 19 years old, so if I make any reference to being drunk, or stupid things I've done while drunk, it's ok, I'm legal. I really can't think of anything else to warn people about, so I guess that's the end of my first entry. Oh, and one last thing. Even though many of you believe that currently the favourite pastime in the oral office is ""Swallow the Leader"", I did not, I repeat, I did not sleep with that young intern. As a matter of fact, I was up all night! (Thank you DX, you guys rule!)"

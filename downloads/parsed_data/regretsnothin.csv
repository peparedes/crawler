"event","<center>so i havent been on this in quiet awhile but i must say my life has been a bit of everything im attending school and i really don't have any dbout's about how i chose to stay living at home and come to CSULB. i've been keeping my life really busy which i really like. i also have a new job which i like i do plan on working 2 jobs for the winter which will most likely kick my ass but w.e i love my life and where its at im sick of fighting for the things i dont need in my life ive struggled enough so see that the minor things i have in life are worth it the few friends ive gained are well worth it and the ones ive lost oh well i guess i didnt really quiet need them ive given up on so many people this past year its crazy but one thing forsure that i know is my bestfriend will always be there EVEN if he is an hour away 
 i've fallen victim of bois for to long and im quiet done i know your all saying"" yeah right jazmine"" but really im happy alone yeah sure i do miss having that one person i can just be lazy with but at the same time im over it i like spending time with my family more now and if their is someone who is willing to put up with me and my handful life then they will come at the right time and i wont have to look  so yeah 
this is my life school work and sleep when i get the chance i love it in the best posible way and im going to make something out of my life this is my one chance and im not going to let anyone take  it 
i hope everyone is doing well and for those of you that read this  I MOST likely MISS YOU!"

"event","<center>yeah its whats happenin ijm looking around and seeing that not many ppl in this world who say they are your friends really are most of them are just fake they wanna get deap in your life and asoon and you make a minnor mistake they pick and pick at it ive had a few hard days and a few good days for the most part i look at my life at money and driving getting outta thisplace going as far as i can from realization without being under the influence i guess you can say i miss moreno valley so much there  i was happy and making something outta my life and im not saying here im not becuse i am since this is all for my own benifit and no one elses but my own. but i look at this as a learning experience to see that no one can really be trusted the ppl i do remain trusting are the ones who i noe for a fact wont do me wrong i still like his boybut he is far past ever even taking a second glance at me so i guess its time i just leave it at that and dont look at at what i had with him. ive learned that no matter how far or how bad me and tyler fall apart we go back to one another and it scares that helll out of me :l well from begining to end i noe im learning at lot as im ending my 11th grade year and im going into my senoir year ganing and losing alot







so on a lighter note well not  so light i guess its finally happening my parents will be fialing for divorce at the end of summer or mid summer not sure and ill be living with my mom as well as im not sure about going to s&f anymore but i will be going up north for a few days as well as arizona summmer will be my huge escape this year and im looking forward to it"

"event","It always seems that I come back to my LJ after months and months of neglect. Anyways..
Im back with my boyfriend, Scott. I really think it will last this time. He seems to have changed for the better. And we mutually decided to just continue counting months and days as if we had never broken up, because i saw him nearly everyday that we were broken up. But as for everything else...
The color guard season has started up and hey im on rifles and i have a bigger part in guard but did i get captain? NO. and why? because i didn't feed the fucking judges for my creative project. I was actuall CREATIVE. Im sorry baking a fucking cake does not count for creativity. I would say more like bribery. Nad the girl that got captain over me giot a position made up for her so that she could have one. And the rifle line all went to camp including HER and she wants to act all high and mighty like she's a fucking professional and knows so much more than everyone else.She knows as much if not less than us about that shit. And for someone who wants to tell people to leave their drama at home and not bring it to guard, she does it a whole fucking lot. It isn't the rifle line's fault that she decided to go to a fucking party and stay up all night the night before band camp. that was her dumb ass mistake. She shouldn't yell at us and punish us because SHE went and got drunbk and did't get any sleep. Someone needs to like crush up some prozac and put it in her food.
   On a lighter note, Im doing my usual slacking with IB.I've done not even a sixth of my extended essay and im not even going to bother with my IA because my teacher next year is just oging to revise it again so ill just leave it. My car [Sheila], has a broken thermostat and im getting that today so that i can actually drive it again and hope it doesn't break down in the middle of jefferson avenue.Scott is leaving for ODU on the 23rd.And unless i cna find a suitable excuse for missing guard  i won't be able to help him move. but its not like he's going across the country. he's onnly going to norfolk so its not that bad.
   welll i suppose i will try to keep this thing updated now.but for now i have to go get that thermo-thingie.

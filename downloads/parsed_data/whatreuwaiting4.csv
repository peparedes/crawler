I saw the old gang from the temple. I like didn't have a single word to say to them. I have just gotten soooo out of touch with them. I mean we haven't hung out since like january. JANUARY!! We all used to be like best friends back in the day. sleepovers, movies, all that good stuff. They're all still friends and they were talking about what they did together last night. It made me sad. When I got home and i thought about it, I literally have like 4 indian friends. 4!! But I really don't like indian girls at all. They're just so...not cool. But still, I was thinking of the old days and all the memories and it made me sad not to hang out with them anymore, but oh well. People do grow apart, I mean I like have nothing in common with any indian person I meet. It's just kind of sad losing old friends and knowing you'll never be the same with them again. :((("

All the people, all the pollution, all the car horns blazing every second, all the tacky outdated clothes. But no worries, i'll go again next year. Till then."

"event","so on saturday, i went to see some random imax movie. it was called MYSTIC INDIA. i was like omg how lame, but it actually turned out to be really good. they showed AMAZING scenery, and i was like why don't we ever go there, when we're in india? but no we have to go to stupid, dirty, polluted bombay. ah, home.
     my dad and i took my mom out to eat for mother's day. it was a non-ghetto indian restaurant (very hard to find) i didn't buy her anything or make her a card, and she totally wouldn't stop reminding me of it. 
     ok so, our english homework is to do 250 note cards by wednesday!!! it's official, ms. benson has TOTALLY FRIGGIN LOST IT!!!!!
     jacob made me listen to the most disgusting lil kim song ever, but i enjoyed it. i'm ashamed, but what can i say, i like vulgarity that taints my oh so virgin ears. 
      well i better go and NOT do my ridiculous amount of homework which includes our stupid sociology final which i will just make a cheat sheet for in 1st period tomorrow.
     that's all for now!"

"event","hello all,

        i had a pretty interesting day. the stupid air conditioners weren't working again today so it felt like i was in india. it was bad. we had a quiz in algebra again. i totally didn't understand what we did, so i copied the answers on my desk. how totally elementary school, i know, but what can i do?
        ms. anyatanwu's final wasn't today. THANK GOD (in my case ganesh). she totally wasn't matching today. she had like rope keeping her shoes together. anyways...
        dr. guo's class was the hottest class of them all. me and robyn took a bunch of pictures in our sunglasses, and made fish faces. it was fun.
         lunch was weird. pheobe where were you?!??! these two random guys came and sat beside me and erin and we were like ooook. and they were like how you ladies doin? and i was like fine (in a very standoffish way). anyways, they get up and shout out BITCHES. i was like wtf, you fucking mother fuckers?!?! erin was like JACKASS!! it was extremely random. 
          MR. LOPEZ WASN""T HERE!!! so me and marya went to jack and the box with her ghetto friends. i felt really out of place. but i got free curly fries and a drink, so wutev. 
           i will have no life this weekend due to our teachers being total bitches, giving us waaaay too much homework at the end of the year. i have to have over 200 note cards for my english research paper. and i have to study for my sociology final. what a waste of time that will be. i think i'll just have a cheat sheet, i mean our teacher is too stupid to notice. 

well that's all for now, kiddies."

THREE BLOCKS DOWN! i was like damn she's good. 

well i'm off to go do stupid english hw. ms. benson needs to freaking get laid and chill out!!!!!!!"

      in algebra i actually understood what we did, and probably got a hundred on the quiz. i don't like ms. shaw's class anymore, we actually have to pay attention now. it sucks.
      i will seriously kill ms. anyatanwu (fucking long ass name). that bitch gave me a 65 on my report card because i was absent the day of our project. fucking bitch can't even spell sociology. 
      i skipped mr. lopez's class today. it felt good. i haven't skipped in a looooooooooong time. and his class is sooooo depressing. me and mayra went to jack in the box, their fries are weird, i don't like potato skins. wutev.
      tomorrow is the dance concert! yay!! and saturday is the international festival! even bigger yay!! i'm gonna volunteer so i can get in free. hehe, what a cheap indian i know. 
      omg finals are like in a month!! but school is almost out. i think i have to go to india this summer. bummer. hehe that rhymed. i really got screwed on the cousin selection, so i'm going to be soooo bored. oh well, at least i get to have servants waiting on me!!! but i actually feel really bad for them because my family treats them like crap. oh well, karma will catch up to their asses.

anyways, thats the end of my pointless entry."

we had science taks yesterday, and boy did i fail. well it serves me right for always listening to my cd player in chemistry. oh well.

i watched the amityville horrors yesterday.of course we had to sit in like the front row, to get the shit scared out of us even more. what an amazingly scary and disturbing movie. omg it was sooooooooo scary, i was like shaking 2 hours later!!!

i get to go to an indian concert today!! yay!! i guess, i mean i really don't like any indian music(not the stuff that indian teens listen to anyways, i listen to the stuff our parents listen to, i know its wrong but what can i say). the only reason i'm going is because one of the singers is SOOOOOOO HOT!!!! (especially for an indian. we kinda got screwed on the hot guys selection) anyways, bhavini will be picking me up, and we will go hang out at sejal's house. might be fun.

"event","ok, so after i watched the ring two (we couldn't get in to see sin city cuz i'm not 17, damn bitches) i had to go with my dad to drop off my mom to some stupid indian concert. when we get there, which is in stafford, i was like where the hell are we. so, we drop off my mom, and me and my dad are retarded when it comes to directions, so we are driving around for like 20 minutes wondering where the hell we are. we finally manage to find the freeway, but my dad goes on 59 south, when i told him we have to go to 59 north to get back home. does he listen to me? NO!!!!!!!!! i just sat in the car and let him drive 50 miles in the wrong way, because he wasn't gonna listen to me anyways. when he finally realized that we weren't anywhere near houston, he stopped at some really ghetto gas station to ask some random man how to get back home. the man tells him to go to 59 north, and i was like I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO!!!! and he starts yelling at me in front of everyone. oh well. so, after we got in the car i didn't talk to him the rest of the way home. he kept on asking me stuff but i was just like fuck you asshole. now we have to pick my mom back up in like 30 min. i don't even know why we came back home. this is fucking bullshit."

"event","5th period- we watched remember the titans which is suprisingly a really good movie. i thought it would be one of those cheesy inspirational movies (which it is) but it was a good cheesy inspirational movie. anyways we have to do this really stupid project over it and i have no idea what to do. i swear the one time we actually watch a movie in that class, ms. benson has to take the fun out by making us do a project on it. GOD, what a nazi.

6th period- i had to freaking teach the class!!!! like i was up there with a book in my hand telling all the idiots in my bcis class to like make a datasheet. stupid coach gillespie is too lazy to teach himself, so of course he chooses his favorite indian person, me, or as he calls me DEVNANI!! so yea i taught the class, which was really hard. I never realized how hard teaching is. I mean you have to go in front of a bunch of kids, who won't listen, and talk about stuff that will put somebody on speed to sleep. 

7th period- the highlight of this class was when we got gummy bears from xuan and olan made gummy bear porn (don't ask) it was too funny, but wrong on so many levels.

8th period- i was on the internet looking at random people's xanga's and livejournals. it was pretty gay, but i listened to the who, which i love and everyobody else should love too. 

I'm almost done with harry potter (i know WHAT A NERD) but this book is really good, and i already know i'm a nerd.

""so, i was walking out of the store and i saw a bunch of hot girls and i was wondering if i could have your number."" 
and we were like ""uummmmmmm.""
so after like 2 minutes of just standing there i finally gave him some bullshit number, but i was really bummed because i wanted to give him the reject hotline number but i couldn't remember it. DAMMIT. oh well, good times.

So then we started watching SAW, and it was soooooo good, but extremely disturbing. after SAW we saw scary movie 3, which was pretty stupid, but funny at times (i was dissapointed). Then we saw harold and kumar go to white castle, which was like the best movie ever. i never thought that a movie about 2 asian stoners could be so good.

Well, no entry by me is really an entry by me without me saying my mom is a deuchsebag, so here goes : damn my mom, grrrr, what a deuschebag!!

I asked them why and they were like ""you have to study for your SAT exams"" and i was like WHAT, its once a week, and they were like ""fine then go ruin your life"" and i was like man WHATEVER. so yea, i can't do ANYTHING until march 12. damn those people that say that you have to take the SAT to get into college and stuff. they suck, i bet they were just unpopular nerds who just wanted to make everyone else suffer. 
Anyways, i was thinking about the SAT and school and stuff, and i realized that i have to do REALLY GOOD on it because my grades aren't that good and i have no extra curricular activities (thanks to two nazis!!!). i was thinking about where i'm going in life, and if i'll end up a fat old lady with 11 kids from a guy my parents set me up with, or if i'll be successful, and rich, and own lots of shoes and cars. I need to make some serious changes in life, because i don't want to end up working at a dead end job, with no future, begging people for money, and being a burden on the family. i want to be something. i want people to see me on the street and be like ""woah its that really successful indian girl that made something of herself. i wanna be like her"" I don't want to be just another person on the road cranky about being late to a job i hate. i really hope that happens some day."

saturday night: on the way to this indian convention(thats what i like to call it)my mom starts yelling at me because she's pms'y. i really didn't care, because it comes so naturally now, i kind of get scared if she DOESNT yell. anyways, so i get there (funplex) and the place is PACKED with all these pakis. why they're so ghetto i'll never know. so i meet my friend and we meet up with some of her friends and they are even ghettoer than i expected. i was scared(haha). indian people seiously have like some weird identity disorder that makes them think they're black or something. that has to be it. i think i'm one of the only sane indian people left. anyways, we walked around for an hour (which was sooooooooooooooooooooo boring i wanted to cry) i didn't wanna go roller skating because there were too many ghetto black kids there and i didn't wanna get shot. 

sunday morning: i wake up and we start eating pancakes that i helped make. that made me feel not useless. then we watched a cinderella story which is such a cute movie. it is beyond hilary duff. she so is not worthy of being in a movie with chad michael murray. so we go to her pool (the neighboorhood pool) to try to get some coke because i'm ADDICTED. it turns out that the pool was closed so i had to climb over the gate which i did, but the god damn coke machine wouldn't take dollars. grrrrrrrr. so after walking around in the cold for an hour looking at model homes (don't ask) we got back and started watching the matrix. we realized it was five and we hadn't taken baths yet (EEEWWW). OK NOW THIS IS WHEN IT STARTS GETTING GOOD. i wear my friends little sister's jacket, and hear something crinkly in the pocket. i open it and saw condems(but i didn't realize that). as i was walking out of her room her little sister came and snatched them from me just as i saw what they were, and she wouldn't give them back. and her mom came up and the stupid asshole that she (the little sister) was like I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING! and so her mom was like give me that. she found them and now she thinks my friend is a major hoebag . she was yelling at her soooo much, and is gonna take her to the doctor to see if she's telling the truth. its sad, and wrong.

Well that was my ultra weird/boring weekend."

"event","well things have changed i must say. and for the better. the mood i say accomplished because well all the stuff from summer has been put behind me completely. i haved finaly moved on from the pain that was burnin this past summer.

   but it is all good now. everything is falling into place. i guess that when ppl say that everything is all good in time. well in this time it is. patience and stick it out when it came time to has jus made me stronger.

  and im glad i got to chill will some of the coolest ppl this past summer. i learned alot from them and stuff. but it was jus cool cause i dont think i could have survived without having them around all summer. well most of all summer.

 and there has been things that last summer i did and hurt a couple ppl and for that im sorry i made some stupid mistakes so to those ppl u know who u are jus accept that im sorry if i hurt u. cause really i didnt mean to.

 but all in all im jus enjoyin my time with my girl stephanie who has been kinda a huge part in helping put the old stuff away and not be afraid to go forward. so thanks babe.

 well gots to go shouldnt be written this in the middle of school."

"event","this journal entry thingy isnt going to be pretty or anything but oh well. ill jus write the shit anyways.

Sometimes u really think u have got a hold on self. u think u have got ur shit straight and nothing can touch u right? till someone comes along jus to show u how much u dont. <i know chris and britt and maybe steph and amy will read this so maybe they can understand me jus a lil bit so they wont have to ask why i do stuff sometimes>

as most of the ppl know jeca fucked me up pretty good. well im jus going to write wat she did do. jus so i can atleast shut the damn door for good.

when i met jeca she was scared to love and broken. her life was crazy and uncertain. from what she was telin me her father was being a dick to her all the time. and her friends were fake and she never felt safe.

i made sure that she didnt feel those things ever again.i wuold hold her all night when she had nightmares jus for her to fall asleep. i always got rid of her problems for her so she could jus worry about school. anytime she needed me i would drop everything i was doing. no matter if it was pooring or desert hot. i would walk or run. everything she ever wanted a guy to do for her i did it.i was her bestfriend i listend to everyhting.every lil fantasy or lil dream she had i made it a reality for her.

im 19 and i dont have a car. should have saved up ppl say right. every cent i had went to make her happy. lil things to big things.from soup when she was sick to a gigantic dumbo jus because.

every moment went to us. she has a problem with her kidneys or somthing and she goes into these spasim things. and i would hold her alnight until she stopped shaking. sometimes a hot bath would help her stop shakng. and one night when she was having a spasim thing there was no hot water. so i boiled water! 

i supported everything she did even if it was a lil farfetched at the time. from wanting to be on s.w.a.t to playing football.

one of my biggest dreams is to become a pro paintball player. for 3 years i practiced and played. and i had a chance to go play for a team that is going to soon. but i turned them down because she didnt want me to leave her so i didnt go. because i thought she truly loved me and it would be worth it no matter what i did.


then it started to turn out she didnt want me playing at all. so i stopped but got out there as much as i could. but to play paintball it cost alot of money.the guns that i chose to use are 1500$ +. and i would sell them for 150-300 jus to get her something she wanted or and engagment ring she wanted.

i thought the person i loved loved me so much that we could do that. and get married when we were done with colledge. 

but she always proved me wrong. this may all seem like im complaining but thats good i dont give a shit.

she got me into a false sense of security and when she felt beter about herself she bounced. and left me like a lil bitch thats the funniest part. then girls say that guys do some fucked up shit. maybe thats cause theres girls like that who get to them first that fuck it up for everyone else.

she would lie to my face and crush me everytime and i knew she was doing it. and she didnt even stop to thnk in the process. 
she made a choice and i told her if she did this she would lose me forever. and she chose to do it anyways and told me she dont know why she did it. well i know one thing if she knew she would lose me and did it anyways then guess im not tht important. but anyways

im over her. but when i see he sometimes my heart jumps out of its chest and i cant breath. sometimes i cant sleep cause i cant feel her in my arms. or i hear a song and shit comes back. or i wake up and reach for her and get nothing but a cold emptiness.

she did more bad then good for me. thats why i will never turn back.

i actualy feel better now that i dont have to worry about her.

well i guess thats why i get silent sometimes and stare into the nothingness. jus to block everything out. or jus remember how comfortable i felt with her and how foriegn she is to me now. and how i feels good to do stuff without her.

well all i have to say is LESSON LEARNED STORY OVER!

R.I.P JECA AND JAYME"

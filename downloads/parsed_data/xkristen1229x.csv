The longest yard was hilarious..with the cheerleaders lol ( you all gotta see that one ) hehe..then Mr. and Mrs Smith came on..it was kinda confussing..so i didnt really pay alot of attention until they brought the big guns out..then it was pretty cool..all the fighting and stuff...yea that leads to today (fathers day) not too exciting...well now i must go set the table..joy..ill post later :-D"

I think I sort of made it up t her, though.  She sorta' smiled at me in the end, anyway.  Either that or.. twitched.

I wonder if she knows what happened with Terry.

I wonder if <i>anyone</i> knows what happened with Terry.  By the time Hooch got to us, we'd already sort of.. stopped.

<font size=1>((OOC: Because Kurai and I are almost never on at the same time, we won't be able to get that Quidditch match log between Thatch and Alexi up in time-- so just pretend it was an AWESOME match <s>because Thatch played awesomely~</s>, V. EXCITING, both players played wonderfully <s>Thatch was better</s> and it was a solid effort from both sides!

We both decided that Alexi would win though, because he's a year older, Thatch was on an old school broom, yada yada, whatever the reason may be.  And SO!  Thatch has now got to wear Ravenclaw's colors for a week.))</font>"

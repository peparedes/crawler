BUTTSECKSSSSS.

So yeah, one of my ex's friends is romantically/sexually (I didn't ask) involved with his cousin.  Everyone is making him feel bad about this.  I've met his cousin, and I have to say, if he was my cousin I'd shag him in an instant.  Fuck, if he was my *dad* I'd shag him in an instant.

So yeah, what do I do?  My heart tells me I should tell him how I feel about his situation, but my head is telling me that if everyone else is telling him to not do it it'd probably be easier for all concerned if I went with the flow.  At least if everyone's telling him to stop there's no conflict there, but their reasons for it are things like ""it's <i>just</i> wrong"" (nothing is <i>just</i> wrong), or ""there's no future in it"" (so fucking what?! there's no future in about 99% of orgasms, doesn't mean they're not worth having)."

"event","Jesus is back on-line, back in halls, and kicking an ass.

I won't bore you too much with the details, but in summary: I left uni, I got bored, I did some work over summer, and now I've restarted my course in Northampton.  Dom, I was going to tell you this, but actually no, I wasn't going to.  There was some reason that I can't really remember now.

So now I'm here.  Fresher's week has passed, just like last time.  The obligatory lay is out of the way, and I'm all set to fall madly and pathetically in love with the next completely-heterosexual-but-very-tolerant-considering guy I meet.  

Who am I kidding, his name's Chris.  He has a ukulele and when I played ""Ultravisitor"" to him his face lit up like he was receiving a thousand blowjobs.  These are the things that make life worth living.

Lectures start tomorrow, they'll probably be wizard or something.  I'm never going to use the word ""sick"" to mean ""good"", or in the case of most people I've heard use it, to describe Hard-Fi."

"event","And so another anticlimax rolls into town. I'm entering the vinegar strokes of full-time education, and it increasingly seems that it's meant nothing. It doesn't feel like the end of something, or the beginning of something else. It's just flat and bland and nothing. There's some party in another block that no-one seems to have any enthusiasm for, I sort of want to go but know that if I do I'll just end up getting drunk and morose. I don't really know what else to do, and I really don't want to end up staying up on-line all night again.

"event","Here's a follow-up to the other night's carcrash.

<i>""Firstly, I spent a while nuzzling up to Owen in Studio1. Owen took it with good humour, which in my drunken state I took for him wanting my hot ass. I haven't seen him since, but I'm actually quite looking forward to the awkward moment.""</i>

The awkward moment was just as good as I predicted, and I've now totally fallen for him in the worst kind of way.  I now think I can win him over by doing nice things for him.  Thank fuck I'm only here another week.

I'm currently looking after a plate he stole from the canteen.  He was supposed to pick it up from my room last night and didn't and for a while I was very very depressed.  I suck, he rulz.


<i>""The bad part is when I got back, having split a cab with some guy we met in Tesco's. I invited him in, we talked about music and drank wine and ate kebab sandwiches together and so on. And then I tried to come onto him. It didn't work very well. He was very polite about it and let me kiss him but never reciprocated. I didn't want him to leave and really persisted with it. I was, in short, a complete asshole. He gave me his number, bizarrely.""</i>

Even more bizarrely, the number was actually <i>his!</i>  Haven't seen him again yet but he seems far too amicable about it.  I guess he's flattered or some stupid thing.  Owen wins on the day because he didn't tell me he wished I was a girl.  Wishing I was a girl is so <i>over</i>.  If I was a girl no-one would let me in their house.  I'd have distinct marks on my back from being done against skips."

But we got something down, something that I at least am happier with, something which isn't four chords looping in a continuous psychedelic funk jam.  It's nice when that doesn't happen.

Spoke to Howard about careers today, he did the decent thing and passed the buck, but not before we'd had an awkward conversation.  I did my best to avoid seeming emotional and crap like I always do.  So far he's the only one who's bothered to try and defend the uni course; everyone else has taken more of a ""what else are you going to do?"" angle on it.  Whatever.  My mind has never been more made up about anything.  If it turns out I'm wrong, I'll live with it."

I felt sorry for the woman giving the talk, she was doing her best, but it takes time and preparation to sugarcoat something like that, especially when you find you're giving your talk to three very attentive people instead of fifty who just want to talk about Neighbours for a bit."

OK, so it was turning me into a crotchetty social retard, but at least I didn't have to use the IT room.  I can't tell if the people here are genuine morons or if its just the accent.  I think it might be both.  How smart does a marine biology student have to be?

I feel quite rough.  I'm still recovering from Sunday night, which was a tad embarassing.  I need to find more people my own age, going out to get plastered really has lost its appeal.  I went to the student bar on Sunday with the intention of just having a nice quiet drink and a chat.  I end up wandering down to Bacchus and back at 1am in my slippers and using someone else's toilet.  I've got some funny looks.  I can't remember if I wrote all this up yesterday, but never mind.

Point is, I'm sick of going out and getting plastered.  Maybe if I was more of a dancer... it's sad, but I drink excessively because there's nothing else to do out.  People up here are wankers and I'd rather just be hanging out with people who I actually WANT to get to know.  I do the suck so bad.  I was under the impression that people in their twenties eventually start going to nice quiet places likes that bar in Coupling and drink sensibly and have conversations below pain threshold and so on.  Like Coupling.  Or some other nice TV show for nice people.  Like The Good Life only younger.

I was going to give up drinking, but re-reading some of this I think I should drink more."

"event","Richard broke up with me.  We're staying friends, which basically means doing what we've been doing for the last couple of weeks.  I don't know how to feel about it, hopefully I will at least figure out what it is that I'm going to go through soon.  Tonight I didn't feel much, because part of me saw it coming.  I knew we were going through a quiet patch, but it was just a question of whether we make it through or not.

The real test will be whether Richard hooks up with someone else in about a week.  I doubt he will.  I had to put up with being molested all evening by people desperate for a bit of rebound action.  I don't get the concept really.

Will maybe write more later, too tired tonight, just walked home through rather a lot of snow/hail/some other cold thing."

"event","I've wasted yet another day drinking without getting drunk, failing to write songs and watching dodgy DVDs.  The music director from The Making Of Silent Hill 2 is the gayest looking Japanese guy I've ever seen.

So yeah, the songwriting thing.  I think I'm going to be forced to accept that I'm not actually as good as I thought.  I've tried it from every angle, I've written from the heart and vomitted from the soul.  All this time, I've had in the back of my mind that, if  can't come up with anything wonderful, I'll just knock out some generic shit and they'll probably love it.

Well, I think I may have been bullshitting myself a bit.  Because I really can't do anything.  I am gloriously inept.  I write abstract because I can barely form a sentence, I write pretentious because I don't have anything to be honest about.  I'm a fucking waste.  So that's it.  I'm at a loss.  I'm just gonna have to give up.  I ahve a shitload of other essays and things to do, I really should be doing them.  I've wasted an entire bottle of wine on songwriting today, I'm going to have to get another one now.

Oh, if anyone has Neon Genesis: Evangelion or has seen it, I require information.  I'm getting obsessed with something I've never really even seen, and that can't be good."

The E Block people were very much Small Doses types, and they don't seem too bothered by what I did to the kettle shortly before I left.  

Today's going pretty well (although that's what I said the day my laptop died), I think I'm getting a handle on CSound, although it's still very very frightening.  Came up with a short song, will either elaborate on the lyrics or just leave them as they are and wank around at the end.  Probably both.  I'll kill it, I know I will.  But yeah, it's about Sarah and home, and it made me feel all warm and happy.  The one about Alice is still shit though.

That's all so far.  I'm going to the theatre later with Richard, so I should probably start drinking in a couple of hours.  God knows what's going to happen, but meh.  It gets me out of the LGB meeting tonite, and that's what's important.

Just kidding, I still love him really and fellate him in my dreams.  

Little else to tell really.  The course now requires me to study paintings and computer programming, while actual music is still far from compulsory.  I guess it comes from teaching Cage; technically, you reading this is music.  I'd leave if I thought I could escape the bullshit that surrounds me, but it follows like a lost child.  

DOM.  DO YOU GET IT YET?  IT TEACHES YOU ABOUT MUSIC.  NOT ABOUT TRIVIA.  MUSIC.  FOR LIKE, YOU KNOW, USAGE.  AS OPPOSE TO CUNTS.

Not that I am slacking in my cuneform duties.  Sorry to those who avidly follow my journal (Apparently you exist.  Make yourselves the fuck known.) for not updating it while I was on holiday.  If it matters to you, fuck all happened.  OOOOOOH, except I went to Hush shortly before i left Northampton, and it's actually good.  Didn't take much time to admire the metalwork, but all signs point to my b-in-law havng done a good job.  Better than your average gaytarded druggerist, anyway.  Anyway, it have glass bricks and the walls didn't sweat and EVERYTHING.  I'd go there again.  In fact, I'd flunk my degree just to spend more time there.  but then, I'm a spastic, so, you know.

Oh well, it does at least mean I can spend a bit more time actually trying to make music, and eventually tidy up the place, maybe do some washing this weekend.  Go to uni for the experience, they said."

Do the test above if you can be bothered.  I got 88.  I'm not entirely surprised, but I suspect anyone who scores highly on it would be a bubbly twat who I would hate, so bleh."

"event","this isn't even the first time it's happened.  For some reason, people  who meet me convince themselves that there's something deep and meaningful going on beneath the surface, that I'm something wonderful underneath my surface.  I wish I knew why they think this.  I'm sure that not everyone is subject to this much scrutiny.  Am I really so fascinating?  It's not a gradual thing either, they do it within seconds of meeting me.  I wish they didn't.  Because ultimately, I end up being the one who has to deal with their frustration when they find out that either a) there's no way to get to this ""Real Me"", or b) they were wrong, and this is all there is.

It's just more complication in my life that I don't need.  I don't know anyone else that seems to have this trouble.  You spend your whole teenage years feeling different, and then, just when you've gotten away from it, *everyone else* starts thinking the same thing.  I'm sick of all this ""what is normal?"" crap.  Can't the government or someone just set up a universal standard of what is normal, and then we can either be that or not be that.  It'd solve a lot of my problems, and in the end I think you'll agree, they're the only ones that matter.

It's been a long time, but lately I really fucking hate myself.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  Matt says I have ""some growing up to do"", but I don't see the point; I'd just be faking being over this stage of my life, moving onto another one, and having to deal with both at the same time.  Maybe he does understand, maybe there's some secret they tell you when you Grow Up.  I don't know.  All I know is, I don't see what difference it would make.

Christ, I'm just unravelling again.  I'm sick of being someone else again.  It's going to keep happening.  I don't know who I am anymore.  That's why I can't show my ""true self"", the nice guy or the asshole or whatever.  I started out being myself, my self being a miserable shit who hated himself and other people, and consequently was hated back or ignored.  Under these circumstances, it seemed not unreasonable to fake it, to be someone I'm not.  But now I'm older, everywhere I go people are valuing integrity and it's just so pathetic.  I don't know what other people are like, so I might be wrong here, but I'm guessing everyone you think is a genuine honest and open person is faking it at least half as much as me, because people who don't lie to themselves and others at every juncture tend to be incredibly unpopular.  People are really hard on liars, because they remind them of their own lies.  I think.  

Could be that everyone else in the world is exactly as they exhibit themselves to be, and it's just me that has the problem.  But if that's not true, I'm guessing everyone will just carry on in denial anyway.  So neither is actually better.

Fuck I suck."

"event","I've pissed off Matt somehow.  I don't understand it.  I don't think I did anything particularly out of the ordinary, but he's pissed off at me.  When I spoke to him on MSN he said that he was pissed off because he thought I was a nice person, even though I act like an annoying twat.  I'm not unwilling to accept the possibility that I'm an annoying twat, but I don't understand the other bit.  I don't get why he's looking for a nice person in me when I don't apparently show any outward signs of being one.  I dont' even understand what he means by a nice person.

Basically, I don't understand.

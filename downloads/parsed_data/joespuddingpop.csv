"event","I was driving around my old home town St. Charles. I saw Amanda driving somewhere in her new car. Oddly enough, I was listening to this song the moment I saw her. And it fits the situation so well. I miss you girl.

Hey baby, is that you? 
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
'Norma Jean', ain't that the song
We'd sing in the car
Drivin' downtown, top down
Making the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheny Avenue

Yeah, life throws you curves
But you learned to swerve
Me I swung and I missed
And the next thing ya know
I'm reminiscin' dreaming old dreams
Wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

I wake up in tear drops
They fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed

Punch the clock
Head for home
Check the phone, just incase
Go to bed
Dream of you
That's what I'm doing these days

Someone told me after college
You ran off to Vegas
You married a rodeo cowboy
Why, that ain't the girl I knew
Me I've been a few places
Mostly here and there once or twice
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright
Yeah, it's good to see you too

Well hey girl, you're late
And those planes, they don't wait
But if you ever come back around
To this sleepy old town
Promise me you'll stop in
To see an old friend
And until then...

I wake up in tear drops
They fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed

Punch the clock
Head for home
Check the phone, just incase
Go to bed
Dream of you
That's what I'm doing these

And baby,

I wake up in tear drops
They fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed

Punch the clock
Head for home
Check the phone, just incase
Go to bed
Dream of you
That's what I'm doing these

Well,I wake up in tear drops
They fall down like rain
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job
Guess not much has changed

No,no,no,no,no,no

Well,I wake up in tear drops
They fall down like rain"

"event","ive been thinking alot about amanda joy lately. dont u love that name. amanda joy. anywho i talk to her alot on the phone, i love how shes always there for me. i miss when we used to hang out but now i work so much and when im not working, she is and vise versa. richie ur lucky fella! she always has a smile on her face. when i look at her i cant help but see her as a goddess. next time u see her just look at her and ull see what i mean. shes amazing. shes so caring and she puts others before her. thats why i love her. sure, im a little old for her, but i remember when we dated, man those were the best days of my life. knowing that i had her love once upon a time means the world to me. 

other than that, ya, that's it."

""The Ghost Of You""

i never said i'd lie and wait forever
if i died we'd be together
i can't always just forget her
but she could try

at the end of the world
or the last thing i see
you are
never coming home
never coming home
could i? should i?
and all the things that you never ever told me
and all the smiles that are ever ever...
ever...

get the feeling that you're never
all alone and i remember now
at the top of my lungs in my arms she dies
she dies

at the end of the world
or the last thing i see
you are
never coming home
never coming home
could i? should i?
and all the things that you never ever told me
and all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
never coming home 
never coming home
could i? should i?
and all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
for all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me

if i fall
if i fall (down)

at the end of the world
or the last thing i see
you are
never coming home
never coming home
never coming home

I am looking forward to the adventure, but I'm so used to people(friends) always being there. It's going to suck for them not to be there. Oh well, lunch break. See ya

"event","So today at worked blew ass. I was so bored out of my mind. I didn't have my cell phone and the phone's at work weren't working. There wasn't any customers who could get a hold of us so there was absolutly nothing to do. Dan's got himself a new girlfriend. She's really ugly though. I asked him if he thought she was sexy and he said no but that he was just bored and had no one else to do. What a flipping retard. I'm thinking about kicking him out. I just want to settle down and get a nice girl and maybe a family going without the constant annoyance of the rest of the people in the house. Oh well you don't always get what you wish for. Damnit I need a magical genie."

"event","<P>Why, Hello all you beautiful people! So this is my first entry to this ""Live Journal"". It is kind of weird knowing that all of these people will be reading my flippin' thoughts. CRRRRRRREEEEEEEPPPPPPYYYYYYYY. Now were to start. Oh! I've got it. Let's start with how my day went, alright kiddies? To start off, Dan set off the smoke detector by cooking breakfast. Apparently, you can't cook bacon for more then a half-hour as Dan so carefully pointed out. We put out the small flames, and went out to McDonalds for breakfast. When we returned to our home, I saw that it was time to go to work. Work went as swell as any day could have gone and I came home around 8:30. Tired, like always. But when I got home, Dan and Shawn were using our hallway upstairs, and the stairs as snow. Meaning they were snowboarding down the carpet on their snowbaords. Super. And now I'm doing this and in a few minutes I will be going to bed. Which will be right now.</P>"

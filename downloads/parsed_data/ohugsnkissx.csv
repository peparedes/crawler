The car ride was really long but thats okay because we got to watch movies! I loved seeing all my cuz i miss them they are so cute. Jamie looked whicked pretty. Let me just tell you how intersting our hotel was lol it was crazy lol. The fricken headbored to the bed was nailed to the wall it was great. Maine people are such hicks its great! So i also have been working a whicked lot but its all good because i def wanna buy a car lol and i have so much fun at work its funny. Well only when you are working with the right people its fun. Yesterday was the most messed up day its crazy. well i started school awhile ago lol its fun i like it all my classes are sweet. It should really be a good senior year i'm excited. This week was so busy. Moday i worked and tuesday i went to school and then i had to stay after for this ""Drum line"" us drummers are trying to have its very intersting. So the i came home casey stoped over and then i had to go back to school 1 hr early to practicee some more then it was extra rehersal from 7-9 that was also intersting. I love the drummesr they are so fun to hang out with . We all have ADHD so bad its whicked funny. So yesterday they had the stupid eng testing and thanx god i don't have to take it because i'm a senior hell ya!! So the whole day was messed up like no one new what was going on .. gotta love that so after we didn't have lunch till whicked late lol so me and jill were starving and went threw the line and right when we were about to go to eat out said in the senior area someone had to go pull the fire alarm so me and jill were smart and brought our lunch outside lol let me just tell you that was intersting! But we got to eat so i was happy. So when the fire trucks finally came everyone only had like 4 min to eat lunch .. suxs for them. They should have been cool and brought there lunch outside lol. So then i had interior till the rest of the day which wasn't so bad but i missed select chrous so so sad. Then yesterday night at work was so funny. I guess when i was on brake this lady came and got her stuff and then wanted to pay but you can't pay with rolled coins so she started FLIPPING like realyl Flipping out! it was crazy so she threw her stuff down and left the store. then i guess she came back screming and saying all this stuff and then was paying for her stuff with i got back on register. So she was still yelling and screaming and saying this and that and i had no clue what she was saying so me and steph looked at each other and started kinda laughing because we both mad a face and the crazy lady looked over at me and was WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ... YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY .. so was like screaming at me so i didn't say anything. And by this time like everyone in the store was looking at her because she made the hugest scene and so she was like yes this little snot face over there is laughing anyone else think its funny and saying all this stuff for like 5-8 min still screaming. So i guess so was walking out but staied inthe little area near the doors to see if we would say anything and some custormer was like Wow snap crakle and POP and we started laughing and she storms back in you still think its fun and started screaming at us some more it was kinda scary though because she was so mad that if she had a gun she would probley shoot us .. weird. But yea that was the inside joke all night it was great. Wow britt and jen are fun to work with crazy stuff happens when i work with them lol. Well now i'm going to go so ttyl bye lots of love!!"

Though somewhat difficult for someone of my nature I am finding it rewarding I have already been offered a place to stay within the church and I've accepted. This is a very trying task for me but I shall endure if not for myself then for Eva I can only hope that others will understand and respect my desicion though any disagreements will hold no bearing on the future I have chosen for myself.<br /><br /><div text=""Hackable"" class=""ljcut"">Now that the formalities are through let me be frank in saying that I've accepted a hell on earth so that I may dwell in a place that will probably be far worse than this all in the hopes of seeing Eva once more. I&nbsp; ""pray"" that&nbsp; I will be successful in my goal because if not someone be it in heaven or hell will have much to answer for.<br /></div><br />That is all good night and .....god....bless...you."

For centruries I have denied myself the pleasures that a demon of my age and status would enjoy, but now....

I suppose that is to be expected when you make such a grave decison. I find myself once more trying to do what is right and still shedding blood and destroying whats left of an already torn family. I now wish that I could just ignore the emotions I worked so hard to develop for now I am drowning in them and left a ragdoll of shame."

There is no way to measure how proud I am of him <strike>This impresses me far more than any demonic ability ever could</strike> Dante is also becoming more open, he recently explained his logic on why he is so bitter towards me, and while I may not agree with his decision I shall respect it. <br /><br />I must remember to have a few words with one Cloud Strife. His recent actions have concerned me and I find myself often wondering what will become of him. If he ever does manage to truly end himself I must remember to pay him a visit in the underworld, death will not end my interest in him. I'm sure he is fine now though he did have Dante to guide him. <strike>I just don't understand why Dante insist on portraying someone irresponicible when it is clear how mature he is</strike> <br /><br />I had another brief encounter with General Sephiroth, I must say he is a very interesting individual.

have been running amok in New Sanctum, as much as I had to admit it, I
am happy to see these events come to pass. Mundus' plans are finally in
action, so soon he will come out of hiding and I will have the chance
to once again banish him into the neitherworld where he belongs.<br>
<br>
The demonic blood the runs through my veins is screaming for his blood,
this battle I feel is mine and mine alone. Though I have gathered many
allies who want nothing more than to aid me in slaying the dark lord,
the closer I get to finally meeting him in combat the more my blood
screams that this is my kill and my kill alone. This blood lust is
maddening.<br>
<br>
I have given my word to Vergil that the one who will slay the Dark Lord
will be him. I believe this to be the hardest promise I will ever have
to keep. I do not wish to see anyone face Mundus except for me, I do
not wish for him to lay on finger on my son's, I do not wish for him to
have the chance to kill anyone I love.<br>
<br>
I have to admit, the closer I get to Mundus the more my demonic blood
pulses, all of the old familiar urges that I have surpressed come to
the surface. I rather enjoy the feeling.<br>
<br>
When you die Mundus I want you to look into they eyes of the men who killed you.<br>
They will be the sons of Sparda.<br>

"event","<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">He
has returned, Mundus. He again comes to claim everything that I care
for. I feel that in the matter of destroying him I will not be as
useful as expected, not due to a lack of ability but a lack of control.
Mundus brings out in me what I have strived so hard to conceal. I am a
devil, a pure devil with no soul it is a fact that haunts me to this
very day but one I have learned to live with. Mundus attacked Vergil my
eldest son, Dante the embodiment of Eva, and Yuna a young mortal girl
who has managed to fit in with a family of demons. For that I would
love nothing more then to slowly torture Mundus into submisson, but it
seems that my way of handling the situation (not neccessarily my way by
choice but by nature) does not fit the ideas of those mentioned
earlier. So I find myself at a bit of a crossroad, I could attempt to
kill Mundus myself and save them from having to encounter such a
battle, and lose what humanity I have and possibly my life. Or I can
wait for Mundus to attack them when he see's fit with the chance of one
of those I care about meeting a tragic end.<br>
<br>
I long to see Mundus again in combat, I will make him pay dearly for
what he has done to my family. I will be there this time Dante I will
be there when you need me. I will not let you down again. Vergil I will
be the man you have looked up to.<br>
I am the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda<br>
And I will kill Mundus again. <br>

<br><br style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">
Let me begin by my evaluation of Cloud. <br>
I believe that this young man
does in fact have the potential to be a great ally in the fight against
Mundus. Any mortal who can stand weapon in hand to Vergil (no matter
what his condition) is a mortal with the potential to do great things,
with that said let me also state that he has the potential, however I
am not sure of his will to use said potential. I have not had much
chance to talk to him but in the moments that I did have it was clear
to see that he was rather distracted. Not to mention I remain unclear
in this young man's motives to join us, he says its for Yuna and that
much is clear but I fear his pride may play a part in his decision. I
also fear that he does not realize what it is he is getting himself
into. If he takes our training lightly he will die, if he takes demons
lightly he will die. I still remain hopeful for Mr. Strife.
<br>
<br>
On to Mister Kaiba Seto<br>
&nbsp;In all my long life I do not believe anyone has ever made such a bad
first impression on me then Mr. Seto. He is a rude, inconsiderate, and
ill mannered twit to which an equal has yet to grace the earth, but
alas the boy is as clever as they come. With his sharp attitude comes a
sharp mind that if molded correctly could benefit all of mankind. I
have assigned him to after school tutoring sessions with me to do just
that sharpen his mind, soften his attitude, give him all the things
that a just ruler would ever need. I have no intentions on putting
anyone on a thrown </span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">at least not anymore</span></span><span style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""> but I have the feeling that
he will find his own place among men on his own, and it would be best
to shape him before that happened.
<br>
Those will be my two finest (mortal) students. <br>
As for my finest
student.
<br>
<br><br>
I would have to examine Vergil.
<br>
My son and I have been constantly training and with each session his
powers seem to increase a hundred fold. He has already conquered me in
terms of speed, and we are an even match when it comes to basic
swordsmen ship. What he now lacks is mastery over his Devil, though
this will take time to train this weakness can be overcome</span>.<br>

saw them. After more than a century I have seen my boys again, and I
couldn't be prouder of them. Vergil has grown to be quite the
honourable warrior (Reminds me so much of the samruri warriors I spent
years living with). Dante well...I have to spend more time with him. He
blames me for Eves death. I love him so much, but it seems the feelings
are very far from mutual. I must say I did expect this to happen in due
time maybe I can make him see. Yes that is a nice thought we can once
more be a family.&nbsp; Vergil has informed me of the tyranny ruling
this world. When will these humans learn, never perhaps. Apparently
they are targeting ""Mutants"" creatures displaying abilities beyond
human capabilities. Its only a matter of time before they find me and
my boys (Especially with my shadow that does tend to draw unwanted
attention ^^)<br>
<br>
Dante I wish I could show you that I would give anything I have to have
been able to save your mother. She was a strong woman far stronger than
any demon I have ever faced, it was her spirit that made her so strong.
I was new to this world when she excepted me, a lost soul. You mother
was fond of picking weapons for me to use on my missions. (She said
Sparda was a hideous looking ""Thing"") I must admit all the weapons she
choose were as effective as they were beautiful from Yamato to
Rebellion all beautiful. I did what was to be done when I left Eve was
well aware of the risk she understood mundus could not be allowed to
return.<br>
<br>
For you Eve I will protect our boys. For you I will protect these mortals<br>

I say to them...what do they think of me. If only I would have told
them what I had to do that night oh god maybe I could have saved Eve.
There is still so much I don't know. I must also mention that I am
finding it quite comforting that I haven't run into any demons. I
thought Mundus would of had this place crawling with them by now. Have
the humans finally found a way to defend themselves....or..could it

"event","When I first started working with the company I currently am employed with (10 years!&nbsp; Gah!!) there was this chic Mitzi that worked there.&nbsp; We are the same age and we got along swimmingly.&nbsp; Mostly because 70% of the time we were together we were drunk. 
Mitz lived with two other girls and this guy.&nbsp; She was always telling me that this guy was so hot and that I HAD to meet him, but all attempts seem to fail miserably.&nbsp; PLUS I was dating Russ at the time and I LOOVED Russ.&nbsp; That is, until Russ moved to DC.&nbsp; Oh, I still loved him, but the love was fettered by Distance.&nbsp; And, really, how can a 22 year old really LOVE someone who they never can have sex with? 
So, one night, all of us crazy kids from work decided to go to a Piano Bar and get silly intoxicated.&nbsp; Mitz said she invited This Guy. 
And, I knew who he was the second he walked into the bar.&nbsp; I didnt even have to ask Mitz if this was This Guy.&nbsp; I knew. 
He mooooved into the bar all Swingeresque in his black velvet shirt with white satin trim,&nbsp;Calvin Kelins&nbsp;sagging just a titch, and black Doc Martin shoes.&nbsp; Not boots.&nbsp; Gah!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; SO DREAMY!&nbsp; All Red Haired and Slenderly Tall.&nbsp; Two silver hoops adorning each lobe.&nbsp; Hot ass goatee and cool sideburns. 
I went up the This Guy and introduced myself as Mitzi's friend Jen From Work.&nbsp; Immediately following that introduction I asked him if he wanted to go to the Tori Amos concert in a couple of weeks.&nbsp; And right after that I asked if he wanted to go dancing.&nbsp; Tonite. Right now.&nbsp; Because I NEEDED to see This Guy's body move. 
And we danced.&nbsp; And then we had breakfast.&nbsp; And then I went home with him because he was easy, I could tell. 
And, then?&nbsp; The next morning Mitzi woke us up and asked us if we wanted to go to a State Football game with her and her boyfriend and we did.&nbsp; After the game This Guy drove me home in his 1976 Lincoln Towne Car and promised to call me tomorrow.&nbsp; And he did. 

Shortly thereafter, This Guy, knocked me up and after 7 long and hard and fun years, This Guy took me as his wife.&nbsp; Because he loves me long time. 

BUT, the point to my story is this:&nbsp; Shortly after I had Holden, Mitzi met some guy from VA and abruptly moved out of state, never to be heard from again. 
And, we all missed her and wondered why she never called!&nbsp; Why she left us all high and dry.&nbsp; All these years I have missed her and loved her for being The Girl Who Gave Me Big Hands. 
Then?&nbsp; Thursday night?&nbsp; I check myspace and lo and flipping behold, who should have left me a message? MITZI!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; I almost swallowed my gum!&nbsp; I messaged her back and told her to give me her phone number.&nbsp; And she did, and we talked for an hour!&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; How do you like that?!&nbsp; It was so fabulous to talk to her!&nbsp; I still cant believe that Myspace actually IS GOOD FOR SOMETHING!!&nbsp;&nbsp; 
And, now I have my friend back.&nbsp; And, I hope I never lose touch with her again.&nbsp; For if it werent for her?&nbsp; There wouldnt be this fabulous Me. 
Thank you Mitz!"

"event","soooo.....Chicago last weekend...I love my sister in law.&nbsp; Ness is the Best Person Ever.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; There is not a bad thing about her.&nbsp; At all. 
SO alls Im gonna say about my weekend in ChiTown was that at 8am on Sunday?&nbsp; When Big Hands called me?&nbsp; To ask HOW MANY SCOOPS OF COFFEE YOU PUT IN THE POT?&nbsp; I pretty much was Still Drunk. 
When we all subsequently got up and Ness made us go eat breakfast?&nbsp; Which we had to WALK three blocks to?&nbsp; Still Drunk. 
And Im not ashamed of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Most of us complain that we never get to go out and have fun. 
I am married to Big Hands.&nbsp; He does what he wants; what I let him.&nbsp; Because you know why?&nbsp; He lets me do what I want; what he lets me do. 
Suffice it to say, I made a lot of friends Saturday night at Rockit.&nbsp; I may have molested the bar manager, Peter.&nbsp; Maybe I did.&nbsp; Maybe I didnt.&nbsp; But really.&nbsp; When you play Purple Rain?&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially for me?&nbsp; &nbsp;What the hell do you expect of me???&nbsp; I apparently will hunt you down like a rabid dog until I corner you until you CANT move.&nbsp; And then, I will dance on you.&nbsp; Be forewarned.&nbsp; Lord knows what would have happened had it been Erotic City.&nbsp; Gads! 
I may have given every one who was seated a lap dance.&nbsp; Perhaps... 
Theres a good chance that Peter played EVERYONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS and I mighta sang every one of 'em.&nbsp; I may have let Nessie's latest conquest, Todd, twirl me around the bar like a baton. 
But whilst doing all these inappropriate things?&nbsp; Manalicious, did I look smokin' hot. 
And, I am NOT ashamed of it."

"event","Its official, just today.&nbsp; This boy is in third grade!&nbsp; Woopah!&nbsp; How on earth did he get so big?&nbsp; In two months he will be eight.&nbsp; Didnt we just read <em>Now We Are Six</em>??<br />Where, where did the time go?<br /><br />I remember when he was born.&nbsp; And, I thought for sure he was going to bore me to TEARS with his not talking and having to be carried EVERYWHERE!&nbsp; Ugh! Because, see?&nbsp; Im not so much a baby person.&nbsp; But, to get to the two year old, you have to have the two month old.&nbsp; Some people, they like the baby.&nbsp; Not so much me.&nbsp; And, I like OTHER people's babies even less.&nbsp; Im sure you'd have me feel bad about this, but I will not.&nbsp; BOOOOORING.&nbsp; They eat, sleep and poop.&nbsp; Thbbbt.<br /><br />And, so when Holden started walking and talking (early, I may add, because I just wasnt having any of it) I was thrilled!&nbsp; And, soon enough after that, the diaper became Big Boy Underwins (I dont know why, thats just what we called them...) and the plug became no more.&nbsp; And now we are talking in full sentences, and climbing UP the slide.&nbsp; The slide that is very very high.&nbsp; And now we are sliding down that slide and writing in cursive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />And now we are almost eight and in the third grade.<br /><br />WE ARE IN THE THIRD GRADE.<br /><br />That is big time stuff, my friends.&nbsp; Big. Time. Stuff.&nbsp; I would now like the hands of time to stop.&nbsp; Hammertime, okay?&nbsp; Because now?&nbsp; We are moving way too fast and soon he will be married.&nbsp; And, then?&nbsp; I will have to spend all my time with Big Hands.&nbsp; Alone.&nbsp;<br />Have you met this man?&nbsp; God help me.<br /><br />Third Grade.&nbsp; With a Game Boy.&nbsp; We are big.&nbsp; We are BIG.&nbsp; Now, we are Growing Up.<br /><br />~~~~~~so this is the part where I start talking about So You Think You Can Dance, and it is very hard capitalizing each of those letter while continuing to type, so from now on I shall refer to it as Party Time.~~~~~<br />This show is probably the best thing on tv right now.&nbsp; This is because I love dancing and everything to do with it.&nbsp; Especially lyrical/modern dancing, because I will cry every time.&nbsp; As Holden so eloquently put it during last season, ""this show is in my heart, mom"".&nbsp; This show IS in MY heart.<br />So we were watching it, and the first girl comes on and says, Blah blah blah, 23 years old...<br />Holden says, ""she's younger than you""&nbsp; I say, ""thanks for noticing""<br />He says, ""young...but pretty""&nbsp; Very matter of factly, as such.<br />And, the girl with the Big Hair?&nbsp; He says that he liked her in Vegas, but now that he's seen her with a partner?&nbsp; ""She's <em>really really</em> good mom, and this is because she is really REALLY pretty.""<br />SO.&nbsp; At least he isnt shallow.<br /><br />I wanted to not like Benji's sister, because, like I said, I like the men, and I like 'em lyrical.&nbsp; But tonite, she and her partner blew me away with that lyrical dance.&nbsp; I cried.&nbsp; It was gorgeous.<br />And, I like Hawk.&nbsp; But, Im still waiting to see if he can do anything else other than street dancing.<br /><br />I promise, soon, I will commit some of thier names to memory.&nbsp; Hawk is the only one that is sticking right now.<br />And, did you see Travis from last year in the audience?&nbsp; So cute.<br /><br />ONE LAST THING:<br />Terabithia is coming to DVD soon and Holden says, ""Dont get me wrong mom, but I thought that was a bad movie.&nbsp; But not bad as in not good, just bad as in I bet people thought they were going to see a happy movie, but it turns out to be sad, and those will be some disappointed people.""<br />Always looking out for the faint of heart, that kid."

Dont. Like. Teenage. Girls. <br />So the whole school (about 30 kids K-12..ack!) singing in front of the entire congregation and the Littles are just Too Cute singing their little hearts out.&nbsp; And, then.&nbsp; In the back row?&nbsp; <em>Sullen Unsmiley Teenage Girls</em>.&nbsp; Ruining the whole thing with their Imjusttoocooltobestandinguphere, soinanattempttoshoweverybodyhowcoolIam, Imjust gonnastandherewithmymouthalldroopy-like.&nbsp; I wanted to punch them in their snotty little mouths.&nbsp; Let me tell you; you just dont want to have that feeling in church! <br /><br />Home again, home again jiggetyjig!&nbsp; Today?&nbsp; I weed whipped.&nbsp; Anybody ever done that before?&nbsp; Makes your whole body vibrate.&nbsp; Feels gooooooooood!&nbsp; My backyard looks dlishus!&nbsp; And, Big Hands moved my Bird Bath over to the ""garden area"" (hint:&nbsp; there is no garden there.) and it just looks great.&nbsp; Kellie, you'll have to come see. <br /><br />So then, the sun is shining and Holden is at the neighbors and I say, HEY! We own this here land!&nbsp; There really is no reason I cant go out into my backyard IN MY BATHING SUIT, and lay out in the sun, huh? <br />And, so friends, I did.&nbsp; And, I read the whole article on Angelina Jolie (or as I like to call her: Angerliner Joler) in this months Esquire.&nbsp; And it was good.&nbsp; SHe is good.&nbsp; Brad Pitts back on my top ten just for shacking up with her. And having so many babies!&nbsp; With her! <br />And, also I read some of the Chuck Klosterman book Im reading called Sex Drugs and Coco Puffs.&nbsp; If you are between the ages of 28-35 this book will speak to you on so many different levels!&nbsp; I love him! <br /><br />Then, BH went to Band Practice and my neighbors asked if Holden and I wanted to eat over there.&nbsp; They were having a barbeque with some other neighbors. <br />I have to tell you, my across the street neighbors are probably The Nicest People Ever.&nbsp; They are good and Catholic right down in there souls.&nbsp; I am grateful for neighbors such as these.&nbsp; And the other couple live down at the end of our street, but are equally as nice.&nbsp; It was really a good time.&nbsp; And this is why:&nbsp; I like to be liked.&nbsp; I mean, if you dont like me, I like to be all Your Loss Suckah.&nbsp; But really Im thinking, Why dont they like me?&nbsp; What is WRONG with them?&nbsp; What is wrong with ME?? OH LIKE ME&lt; IM NICE!!&nbsp; That is because I am needy; shh, dont tell. <br />SO it was nice to have dinner with Neighborly Friends.&nbsp; Because that is all I have ever wanted in a neighborhood.&nbsp; To make friends with the adults whose kids MY kid is INCESSANTLY playing with.&nbsp; THEY have four kids.&nbsp; One teenage girl, who is not at all like the above mentioned Teenage Girls.&nbsp; Kelsey is NICE and GOOD.&nbsp; But, they also have THREE boys.&nbsp; Holden is in HEAVEN! <br /><br />Today was a good day. <br />I like that.&nbsp; I like good days.&nbsp; Where nothing much happens, but it means the world anyway!"

"event","I NEED to post something because I know a lot of you have been praying for my mom and thinking about her.&nbsp; I have 10 minutes before Holden has to go to bed.&nbsp; So here it is: 

Week One in the Hospital in Lansing:&nbsp; This is not good.&nbsp; We Drs cant do anything, here.&nbsp; Too risky.&nbsp; Send somewhere else. 

Week Two ITHIL:&nbsp; Death!&nbsp; Tumor?&nbsp; Blood Clot?&nbsp; Death. We can do nothing here.&nbsp; You go to Ann Arbor. 

Week Three, Now in Ann Arbor:&nbsp; Well Shit.&nbsp; This is a tuffy. 

Week Four-Six, NIAA: Hmmmm.&nbsp; This is big. 

Week Five, NIAA:&nbsp; OPERATE!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Week Six:&nbsp; No operate.&nbsp; Platelets low.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operate. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No operate. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operate. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No operate. 

Week Seven: Okay, now we operate.&nbsp; But you probably will die.&nbsp; Wanna just go home?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Okay...Say goodbye. 

Okay, so surgery was suppose to be six hours at LEAST.&nbsp; After three they called us.&nbsp; We were worried, but surgeon says, We were able to remove it without cutting!&nbsp; HUGE TUMOR!!&nbsp; Sarcoma, but we got all we could see.&nbsp; Mom in TICU.&nbsp; This was last Wednesday. 
On Thursday morning they woke her up and took her off the oxygen.&nbsp; On Friday she got moved to a stepdown unit.&nbsp; On SUnday we went to visit her and SHES SITTING UP&lt; I KID YOU NOT.&nbsp; And walking (with a walker) which is something she hasnt done since WEEK ONE. 
She may some home tomorrow or the next day. 
Is cancer. 
Probably elsewhere, too.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; At least she gets to come home though.&nbsp; She REALLY is homesick, and we are too.&nbsp; For her. 
SO we will deal with the rest as it comes. 

God always answers your prayers.&nbsp; Maybe not always the way you want Him too, but they ARE answered. 
More later, and thank you to everyone who was sending the positive vibes our way.

"event","Because I can only say that ""my mother has a tumor on her heart the size of your fist and wrist together"" so many times before even I get sick of hearing it.
Because so much of my time has been spent driving to and from UofM hospital that I crash every night.
Because the emotional roller coaster is KILLING me.
Because, once, the doctors told Mik that she should probably call her family, and by the time we got there, Mom was sitting up and looking okay~ish.&nbsp; False Alarm?&nbsp; If there is such a thing&nbsp;under these circumstances.
Because not even my little family of two has seen me much these last three weeks.
Because then people you havent even spoken to in MONTHS start crawling out of the woodwork and asking how your mother is.&nbsp; As if it is any of there business at this point.
Because for a while, there, I became so very numb that even my fingers couldnt feel the keyboard.
Because really?&nbsp; When your mom is on the cusp of death, everything seems SO inane.

But I have been reading when I get the chance.&nbsp; It just has seemed, I dont know...too much work? to type in a comment.
But I thank you (spa) for checking up on me and making sure that I have not dropped off the face of the earth, and to see if everything is alright.&nbsp; And I miss you."

"event","I remember reading that book, but I cant remember what its about.&nbsp; How dumb.&nbsp; Thats what I do, though; I read and unless the book really touches me, I forget it.&nbsp; And, that book has to really get me in a special spot...<br />But, now I have to read it again, because how my mother directly relates to me as a person has been a prevelant focus in my life for the past three days.<br />I think it was last March or April when my mother was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma.&nbsp; It is a rare cancer that affects the muscle and soft tissues.&nbsp; Now, dont quote me on that, because the doctors are all like&nbsp; <em>Blah blah blah Cancer blah blah doctor talk.<br /></em>So we did the surgery to extract it and then the chemo to kill the bits of it floating around and then the radiation to make sure that everything surrounding the tumor was dead.<br />And, her hair fell out and grew back and then she was better.<br />And then my brother got into a serious car accident.<br />And then my dad had double bypass surgery.<br />And, now my mother is <u><em><strong>back</strong></em></u> in the hospital with a blood clot the size of ANN ARBOR on her <strong><em>HEART</em></strong>.&nbsp; THe doctor said this was the biggest clot he's ever seen and he doesnt even think there is a paper written about something this big.&nbsp;&nbsp; They've got her on blood thinner (heprin) and it will take a week to see a difference in the clot.&nbsp; If it works they'll keep her on it for another week.&nbsp; Then they will do surgery.&nbsp; But they are hinky about going in there.&nbsp; Because its so big.<br />Then they gave her an echocardiogram and found that the clot is really unstable and could embolize in her lungs at any time.&nbsp; Do you know what that means?&nbsp; Probably death.<br />SO they move her to Cardio Care ICU to be able to track her better and all that.<br />Ugh.&nbsp; Already Im sick of talking about it.<br />She seems to be doing ok, though I dont even really know what OK is for her anymore.<br />And People want to hug you when your mom is on deaths door.&nbsp; And they want to tell you that it will be Okay, and that We Dont Know Anything Yet.&nbsp; And Its In Gods Hands. And We Dont Know What Gods Plan Is.<br />DUH.&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; Quit talking to me. And for goodness sakes Quit Touching Me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />My moms best friend was there last nite, and all I wanted to do was punch her in the face.&nbsp; And really make her nose bleed.<br />I KNOW.&nbsp; What a bitch I am.<br />When my mom got out of her first sugery last year, and they found out the tumor was WAY different than what they thought it was and the SURGEONS looked DEPRESSED?&nbsp; My Aunt Char tried to hug me and I almost knocked her out.<br />Because what am I going to do without my mom?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; How am I going to function?<br />And its funny because my mom is not who I go to for advice.&nbsp; She's never been that to me.&nbsp; She had me when she was 17.&nbsp; We are like friends.&nbsp; She never has criticized any decisions Ive made.&nbsp; She knew I was pregnant before I did.&nbsp; And, she told me I was pregnant OVER THE PHONE.<br />I have never wanted to be like my mom.&nbsp; We are so different.<br />But we look just exactly alike.&nbsp; And, you know how some women marry men like their father?&nbsp; I married my mom.&nbsp; And she loves Gabe.&nbsp; She's probably the only person in my family that gets him.&nbsp; And she's so proud of the life we have together.&nbsp; And she knows Im a really good mom.<br />She has known me longer than anybody.&nbsp; She was My Mom for four years before she was anybody elses mom.&nbsp; She's mine.<br />When she's gone, who's gonna know me?<br />So.&nbsp; If you've stuck around this long, and you've got a prayer in you, I'd sure appreciate it."

"event","I just caught the last 15 minutes of Gigli.&nbsp; I have no earthly clue what this movie is about.&nbsp; I make it a point never to watch any movie with Ben Affleck in it because he is a wussy face and I cannot even stand him (except for in Good Will Hunting.&nbsp; He is pretty good with character roles.&nbsp; A leading man, he is not). 
BUT, I love Jennifer Lopez.&nbsp; I cant help it.&nbsp; She is so pretty and normal ish.&nbsp; You cant always help who you love (her current Rat Face husband...)!! 
And this is why I cant tolerate Benji.&nbsp; He cries all the time.&nbsp; ""Oh I love you, cry cry cry""&nbsp; ""Please dont leave me cry cry cry""&nbsp; ""I dont wanna leave you heavy sob""&nbsp; ""I hope my spacecraft doesnt explode before I get a chance to play Animal Crackers on your hip whine whine moan and cry""&nbsp; ""My wife died and I masturbate a lot when my daughter goes to bed oh woe is my cry"" 

Okay, so its obvious, now, that I DO watch Ben Affleck movies because I seem to know a great deal about his films (I AM embarrassed...) but, I do not LIKE watching them.&nbsp; Because of the incessant Cry Babyishness.&nbsp; Egad.&nbsp; The crying.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Where was I? 
Oh...Gigli...last fifteen minutes...kissing Lesbian Jennifer Lopez, telling her that if she ever decides to ""hop the fence"" to keep him in mind...kissing...Yep.&nbsp; Getting choked up.&nbsp; Ack.&nbsp; Thbbt.&nbsp; Cant stand it.&nbsp; PLUS!&nbsp; I AM heterosexual, and he makes me want to hop the fence over to the Lesbian side (there's a fence???) 
Watching the last fifteen minutes makes me want to watch that movie even lesserer. 
Trust me, I was a lot more put off by it moments ago whilst watching it.&nbsp; Cringing. 

A movie that I was NOT cringing whilst watching was The Departed.&nbsp; Big Hands and I rented that last nite, and was it worth it?&nbsp; Yes it was!! 
Marky Mark was hilarious!&nbsp; So was Alec Baldwin. But I find Alec funny all the time.&nbsp; The best line from him was something like;&nbsp; You wanna cigarette? No?&nbsp; You dont smoke?&nbsp; You f**king health nut! 
But you have to say it all strung together without giving the other person a chance to respond.&nbsp; Trust me, it was funny.&nbsp; Matt Damon made me hate him.&nbsp; I spent a lot of time confused, but in that good way that the movie wants you to be confused.&nbsp; And, please...Nasty Jack was wonderful. 
We also rented Flushed Away for Holden.&nbsp; I watched it with him and I was laughing right out loud the entire time!! 
Holden thought it was funny, too.&nbsp; Good decisions on my part! 

So, on a completely DIFFERENT note:&nbsp; Holden is being a complete butt face.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; We can barely stand him.&nbsp; He gets angry at the drop of a hat, slams doors, is incredibly disrespectful.&nbsp; We dont even know what to do.&nbsp; It could just be that in the last two weeks he has been Two Parent-less, as Holden and I went on Spring Break, and then the next week Big Hands went to Vegas.&nbsp; I dont know.&nbsp; Could this just be a phase?&nbsp; Any advice?&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Im asking.&nbsp; Kel, you know him... 
I just dont know if we should just let him get back in the swing of things, or if we should see a doctor!&nbsp; Help!!

"event","So, Big Hands left for Vegas yesterday.&nbsp; Got there at 5pm my time, 2pm Vegas time.&nbsp; He had imbibed...right??&nbsp; on the plane and was sufficiently, Um...Happy?&nbsp; when he called me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
That was also the last time I heard from him.&nbsp; Its 3:20pm right now.&nbsp; Noon his time.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; Lou told me to hold off til 5pm to call him. 
But, you know...when your husband is in Vegas.&nbsp; And you think, Boy I sure do hope he's having a good time!&nbsp; But REALLY you are thinking, I sure hope he's not overdosed in the corner stall of a smelly bathroom in a seedy casino with a crack whore?&nbsp; You know what I mean. 
Yeah.

~edit
okay, so he DID call me, 1pm my time.&nbsp; No crack whores, indeed!"

Thbbt.

So.
Vaca was splendiferous.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; My son is a FISH!&nbsp; Two hour MINIMUM in the pool.&nbsp; Everyday.&nbsp; One day we went to the beach for three hours and when we came back he went straight to the pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And, my MIL was sooooo happy to see us.&nbsp; I didnt even spend half the money I took with me.&nbsp; They wouldnt let us buy a thing!
Hot and sunny everyday.
Oh!&nbsp; Florida!&nbsp; Even though you are filled with Old People, I miss you so!

~this is the book review part~

Franny and Zooey by JD Salinger

You like him?&nbsp; Oh. I do.&nbsp; This book is better than Catcher in the Rye by spades.&nbsp; And, by that I mean WAYYYY better.&nbsp; I read this book once before about ten years ago.&nbsp; But, I had to read it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Its a thinker, though. Even though it is a Thin Book, it has a lot to say.&nbsp; A lot about Religion.&nbsp; Personal Religion.&nbsp; You know...about your own, personal Jesus.
Good Good Good book.&nbsp; But hefty.&nbsp; It took like two weeks of reading a little at a time to get through it.&nbsp; You have to ponder it.&nbsp; Or maybe YOU wont, but I did.
I love this book.&nbsp; Read it.&nbsp; Do it.&nbsp; Do it now.

~end of review~

See?&nbsp; Im having a bit of trouble finding my Voice, here.

Took Mom to Ann Arbor this a.m.&nbsp; Was up at four.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; That is early.&nbsp; I am sleepy.&nbsp; I cancelled Piano tonite.&nbsp; Thank God Big Hands isnt here, or he would have a caniption fit!&nbsp; Is that how you spell caniption?&nbsp; Maybe Holden and I will go to Old Country Buffet tonite.&nbsp; Hmmmm.&nbsp; He has a coupon. Hmm.&nbsp; I ate out last nite, too.&nbsp; WHO CARES.

Oh what else?&nbsp; Im reading a book about Mormons right now.&nbsp; Bug had said that someone told her that Big Love was no where close to reality.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; And its just the extremists.&nbsp; The Fundamentalists.
Cant wait to finish it so I can review it.&nbsp; I have a lot to say.&nbsp; Im just reading this book and shaking my head.&nbsp; Holy Crazy People Bat Man.
AND, if you, reading this, are a Mormon, you will know perfectly well that I am not talking about YOU.&nbsp; You will know who I am talking about, so quit with the indignation, okay?
More later when my brain finds my body."

So, we'll see how this goes.
Its just that I get disgruntled so easily.&nbsp; And sometimes you just want Light, you know?&nbsp; Not like the Sun Light, but like Not Heavy, Light.
And I was BIZZY at work.&nbsp; Holy Cpw.&nbsp; Man Almighty.
BUT, I AM ON VACATION NOW!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sunday, my beautiful son and I will board a plane for Florida.&nbsp; His first plane trip.&nbsp; My first since I was a senior in High School.&nbsp; So that was....Oh.....14 years ago.&nbsp; SHeesh.&nbsp; That shit cracks me up.&nbsp; 14 years ago.&nbsp; ha!
Okay, so What First?
On Tuesday I quit smoking.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; On Tuesday I started to quit smoking.&nbsp; I KNOW.&nbsp; Nobody likes a quitter and I dont either.&nbsp; Black Lung is my favorite color.
Oh, and if you are one of those, ""oh my god, i cant believe you smoke, ack ick ewe, die!!!""&nbsp; Just shut up, okay?&nbsp; I Love To Smoke. Oh man!&nbsp; WHen Im in my car and driving and listening to NPR, NOthing is better than a Marlboro Ultralight.
BUT, I will die if I keep this shit up, so enough!&nbsp; I quit.&nbsp; Also, I NEVER smoke at home, I never smoke in my car if Holden is in it.&nbsp; Mostly, I smoke at work, and while driving alone in my car.&nbsp; And, I can go a really long time without a cigarette, so I just decided that I would go the rest of my life without a cigarette.&nbsp; AND, I think I am doing OK!&nbsp; I have not killed anyone yet.&nbsp; I think the PMS is helping camoflage the rage!

My mother has to have a brain scan.&nbsp; I am trying very hard to be Very Optimistic about this.&nbsp; I will take her to Ann Arbor on the 10th for that.

My pregnant friend Chris found out there is a good possibility that she has Thyroid Cancer and will have to have THAT out at the end of the month.&nbsp; Totally treatable.&nbsp; We are not being down in the dumps about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Any of it.&nbsp; What can you do?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Worry only makes it worse, and makes you crazy.&nbsp; I am so thankful that neither she nor my Mom are worriers.
So, we do the tests, we take body parts, we mend, we heal, we do radiation or radioactive iodine, we get better, we raise healthy children.&nbsp; This is what we do because this is how we roll.

IN other news...Sister Rach got a job.&nbsp; HOLLER.&nbsp; Yay!!

Im going to Florida!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; For five days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

We have to: 
1. Go to The Hobby Lobby.&nbsp; We shall be Crafting Fools later.&nbsp; Have to make Gramma Mary her picture frame to take to Florida with us!&nbsp; Wheeee!!&nbsp; Florida is less than 3 wks away!! 
2.&nbsp;Go hit up McD's to see if there are still some Shamrock Shakes to be had. 
3.&nbsp;Grocery Shop.&nbsp; My favorite thing to do Ever! 

Big Hand's Band played their first gig with him in it!&nbsp; Yeah!!&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; The lead singer ended up in his Underpants by the end of the show.&nbsp; AND he was wearing a kilt to begin with.&nbsp; I already heart him. PLUS, he dragged me up to the front of the bar and seranaded me with Simple Man by Lynnard Skynnard.&nbsp; Who the hell does NOT like that song?&nbsp; I do not know. 
The band is: http://www.myspace.com/originoffate1 
They rock, I must say.&nbsp; Big Hands was having so much fun!&nbsp; And the lead guitarist SHREDS.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; He is awesome. 
BH is not yet on the website, as he has only been IN the band for two weeks now.&nbsp; Check them out.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Do it. 

Saw Lupe Fiasco last nite.&nbsp; Holy Moly.&nbsp; If only we could see JT in that kind of venue!&nbsp; It was at the Fairchild Auditorium at State. 
Basically...Lupe is Dope.&nbsp; Perhaps the dopest MoFo ever.&nbsp; Kanye can suck it, cuz Mama's got a brand new Rap.&nbsp; I was THO-ING DOWN, ladies.&nbsp; He is awesome.&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; Awesome and HOT.&nbsp; Whew.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Regular.&nbsp; Normal.&nbsp; Poopy.&nbsp; Crap.&nbsp;<br/>What have you done to me?&nbsp; Am I going thru a quarter life crisis? (Yes.&nbsp; I plan on living to be 128, healthy, and sexually active.&nbsp; Wink wink)<br/>When I was a teenager, I never was into the latest fad.&nbsp; That was because I went to a parochial school, and my parents were bent on making&nbsp;sure&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;complete dork.&nbsp; (But, I have blossomed into quite a stunning married lady with a kid, I will tell you that!)<br/>I never wrote Ralph Macchio a fan letter.&nbsp; Never went to a concert.&nbsp; Never teased my hair.&nbsp; Or skipped school, or cheated on a math test.&nbsp; Never sneaked a cigarette, or a sip of my father's Jim Beam.&nbsp; The list of nevers could go on forever!<br/>But then.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I turned 30.&nbsp; And you turned 25.&nbsp; And, more importantly, you Cut Your Hair.&nbsp; Thus allowing me to take you more seriously as a singer/performer/all around hot guy.&nbsp; And, MOST importanly you started taking off your shirt~God bless you!&nbsp; Or maybe you have always taken it off.&nbsp; I just recently started noticing.<br/>Anyhoodle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>You are making it hard for me to concentrate.&nbsp; And, people are starting to make fun of me.&nbsp; (I dont care, though.&nbsp; They just dont know how to Live!)<br/>So here's the deal, Sweet Justin.&nbsp; I will be a fan, okay?&nbsp; But thats it.&nbsp; This relationship cannot go any further than that, okay?&nbsp; I am, after all, a married woman.&nbsp; I will continue to go to any concert of yours that I can.&nbsp; I will.&nbsp; That is a promise.<br/>Maybe someday we can be friends.&nbsp; I figure that if I keep getting older, you will too!&nbsp; I have a tendency to wear people down.&nbsp; I may have to wait til Im 40 to get a picture with you.&nbsp; By then, you will be 35, and almost at the end of your prime.&nbsp; There will be someone new to melt the hearts of young girls. (Sorry, its true.)<br/>But know this; &nbsp;you are the only celebrity person to melt mine.<br/>In the meantime, Im going to have to ask you to get out of my head.&nbsp; I have a Life.&nbsp; With Big Hands and Holden.&nbsp; I intend to live it to its fullest.<br/><br/>Yours very Truly,&nbsp;<br/>The Girl Who Could Have Been Yours For the Taking, In Some Other Life."

I cant even fully describe it without sounding like a tool.&nbsp; And, I am not&nbsp;generally a fanatic.&nbsp; So Im just going to leave it at that.

That concert rocked, tho.&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy mother of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pink was awesome, and I am not a fan, really.&nbsp; Wasnt. I will be now.&nbsp; There were those acrobatic scarves involved.&nbsp; And dancers and Pink wrapping themselves in them, and winding and grinding and twirling and OH! you thought she was gonna fall, but she did not!!
Then Justin came out and completely Rocked the Fucking Casbah, okay?&nbsp; I mean, that dude is even more wonderful in person.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; There were times he was probably less than 10' away from us, wouldnt you say, Kel?&nbsp;&nbsp;
And, he sings wonderful, and his dancing is just SLAMMIN'.&nbsp; And he played the piano, and the organ.&nbsp; He beatboxed.
I cant describe how great it was.
I just cant.&nbsp; Im still dumbstruck."

"event","The other night whilst putting this dear, awfully cute child to bed, he told me that he and Alli decided that if they knew each other after college, they were going to marry each other.&nbsp; And, wouldnt Bridge to Terabithia be lots more fun if we took Alli. 

Why of course it would! 

And, so after a phone call to Alli's mom, which by the way, embarrassed my poor son as I mentioned the nuptials, We had a date. 

I cried through the entire last half of that movie.&nbsp; Pretty sure Holden would have cried if Alli wasnt there.&nbsp; Alli=stoic as always.&nbsp; She never makes a peep other than to laugh hysterically at Holden.&nbsp; Giggle is more like it.&nbsp; She thinks everything he does is funny.&nbsp; And, it usually is.&nbsp; But thats the thing about Holden; Everyone thinks Everything he does is funny.&nbsp; Therefore giving him the illusion that, well, everything he does is funny.&nbsp; So then he makes SURE that everything he does is funny.&nbsp; And, I gotta say, its not so funny all the time. 

Did you ever see Savanah Smiles?&nbsp; Holden and I bawled through the end of that one.&nbsp; The both of us in puddles.&nbsp; I Am Sam?&nbsp; We bawled.&nbsp; I love Love LOVE that he is sensative most of the time.&nbsp; It makes me so happy that he has this gigantic heart.&nbsp; It makes me happy that he is Exactly Like Me.&nbsp; And, Big Hands knows this, too.&nbsp; He isnt always so pleased.&nbsp; He wonders if this kid is really his.&nbsp; Holden looks like me, and he acts like me. 

Now.&nbsp; I love me some Big Hands.&nbsp; Oh, Gad, do I Ever.&nbsp; He is the love of my life.&nbsp; No doubt.&nbsp; But, loving him is Work.&nbsp; A lot of Work.&nbsp; He is cynical.&nbsp; And, Always Right.&nbsp; He is not empathetic at all.&nbsp; He believes in the Church of Big Hands.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; Not so appealing, right?&nbsp; Well, he's MY pain in the ass.&nbsp; And, I love him.&nbsp; Because he also Takes Care of Us.&nbsp; And, Loves Me For Who I Am (though I DO believe this is why he also wants to ring my neck!!)&nbsp; And, hes Hot.&nbsp; And Sexy.&nbsp; And Tall.&nbsp; And, he Used To Be Skeletally Thin.&nbsp; Not so much anymore, but I Remember When very well, due to my amazing imagination (which BH does not have).&nbsp; And, to put it frankly: he is awesome in the sack. 
SO, what I was saying, and got terribly off track, is that Some Girl is going to be Very Lucky to meet and marry My Son.&nbsp; Because he is me, and I am AOK.&nbsp; I do not want some Poor Girl to have to work so damn hard! 

I really hadnt meant to say so much.&nbsp; But, wait, there is more... 

Speaking of Alli's Mom.&nbsp; Nice Gal.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; But, I do not understand these women who live in this town.&nbsp; Well, yes I do.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; They married Corporate Climbers, and THEN had kids.&nbsp; And then stayed home with their kids.&nbsp; Which, I would have LOVED to do.&nbsp; Because, let me tell you-Big Hands is a Corporate Climber.&nbsp; But, he just knocked me up before we had a chance to make money.&nbsp; And, now that we are making money, my son is in school all day, so what would I do with myself?&nbsp; Plus, I really REALLY love my job.&nbsp; And, I am not at all a CC.&nbsp; I am the exact opposite.&nbsp; I am a Comfortable Employee!&nbsp; My job allows me the freedom, though, to be where I need to be for Holden, whenever I need to be there.&nbsp; That, you dont get just anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
What I would LOVE to do, is work part time when Holden is in High School, so that I can be home when he gets home from school.&nbsp; You know, so that I can totally piss him off that he wont be here alone with his slutty little girlfriend, or his Pot Head Friends.&nbsp; Haha, sucker. 

I just want to be FRIENDS with some of the mommies around here, but we have NOTHING in common, but that our kids are in the same class!&nbsp; Ack.&nbsp; I am going to meet one of my myspace friends next Saturday.&nbsp; She literally lives right around the corner from me.&nbsp; Her daughter is younger than Holden and she is a couple of years older than me.&nbsp; Im hoping this just evens out, and that we can be friends. 

It saddens me, the most, that some of the people I have the most in common with and talk to all the time, and share the most of me with, live so far away.&nbsp; Boo."

Right now.&nbsp; Right this very minute, Im feeling something for Britney Spears.&nbsp; I cant put my finger on it, this feeling.&nbsp; But I think its in the&nbsp; I May Feel Bad For Her catagory.&nbsp; Really. 
This is sad. 
I believe this girl is suffering from Post Having a Baby Depression, and she needs some help. 
Someone needs to knock her unconscious and take her to the Hospital.&nbsp; STAT. 
I have to believe that PPD has to have something to do with it, because I can not imagine a mother saying, Fuck you, kids, okay?&nbsp; Cuz I want to have a meltdown in front of God and everybody right now.&nbsp; Suck it kids. 
No mother, I dont care who you are would do that unless there is something Wrong with you. 
Somebody help her please.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Because I am tired of this making national news.&nbsp; We have soldiers dying daily, and this is what we hear:&nbsp; Britney Anna Anna Britney.&nbsp; I. Am. Tired. Of. It. 
I also am not a fan of KFed, But Cripe. 
I hope he can get the kids for a while at least.&nbsp; Who is taking care of them?&nbsp; He cant fuck them up any worse than she is right now.&nbsp; The worse he could do is sing some really crap rap to them.&nbsp; I will take that over Nervous Breakdown Mama, any day."

(well besides my 7th grade teacher Mrs.Winter..however she didn't know I was in the show).  
but its all goooood.

in general things are really great. camp is almost over which makes me so happy. and i leave for new jersey soon, (the 12th) and stay for a week..and then leave for buff 4 days after. i cant wait. auditions are the first week i get there, but i already picked out my song and i think its going to go well. they're doing ""she loves me"" which is a ""cute"" show. and for one of the straight plays they're doing ""the importance of being earnest"" which i love, so im excited. its going to be a great year.

i love all of my friends that ive been with, they truly are my best friends.
ball was fucking fantastic.  after ball party at my house was a lot of fun..from what i remember.
then jones beach the next day was incredible.  SWEET AND SOUR. passing a lighter to another moving vehicle so the people in the other car could smoke their blunt. (mind you..we had no idea who it was).
then coming home and having a good ol PeePee. (Pizza Party). and watching goonies (but for me it was just cuddeling with a teddy bear and going to sleep in matty's bed).
then late night hang outs have been amazing.

everything has just been ideal.
so everyone just give me a call, and lets hang out because in what...2 months? ill be gone. crazy. maybe a little more than 2 months. hollaaa.

"event","so i saw the benefit performance of rent with the original broadway cast.
and it was the most incredible thing that has ever happened to my life. and i feel bad talking about it because people tell me how jealous they are, but it seriously was one of the most amazing things ever. the cast was incredible, adam pascal and idina menzel can touch me constantly. i even liked the girl playing mimi (which was weird cause i hated her voice on the cd), i thought she had such stage presence. it was funny though because idina, taye, and adam messed up on some of the lyrics, and they made it obvious because they'd start singing and be like ""la la la i dont know the words"" and i loved it. it made it really personal i think.
god it was so good. i went with kristin and ren, and we walked in on the red carpet right behind bon jovi. and the after party was so fun. my downfall was the open bar...that they weren't id-ing me at. that was ideal. :)
i think my favorite person i met was joey fatone from nysnc, he was so nice to me. like my friend allison that we met at the party was standing next to me and she was like oh my god joey you were amazingin rent, i saw it with you in it! and he was like oh thanks so much, whats your name? and she said allison. then he turned to me and he was like hey man, im joey whats your name? and i said im kevin whats going on? it was just so nice.
and frenchie was so funny cause she was wasted and we both told each other how awesome the other one was.
i want to go see the cast on bway now because i met a lot of them, so its nice :) i was talking to this one guy..and thought he was just a normal person. but then later realized he was actually in the cast of rent when i was looking at the pictures and saw him on stage in them. i was like uhhh fuck thats awkward.
god it was nice to be a celebrity for a night. ive decided im gonna become famous so i can keep it up. for real though, just wait for it :)

i feel like hartford can give me better exposure
buffalo is bigger, i like bigger
buffalo is cold, i hate the cold.

a big problem is, i've been asked to audition for a play at westchester broadway theater...i can finally become equity. i can actually get my career STARTED and become a real actor, and audition for real shows in the city. 
if i go to buffalo, i'll be leaving that. completely. if i go to hartford, i can still do the shows there.

"event","so play is over. it was fun. definitely a good run :)
there was rumors that it was the best chs musical production ever, which was quite the compliment for us all.
it was an amazing experience, i'll definitely miss it. its my last musical at chs ever..craaazzyy.

but i cant wait for college, and to start the next chapter in my life so to speak. i'm going to university at buffalo..so i'll be cold, but i can't wait. the dorms are freaking incredible. the theater holds 1,744 people...its the same size if not bigger than most broadway theaters. the theater programs incredible..they only accept 10 people into the program. it'll be an amazing experience, and i cant wait.
college is what you make of it :) and i'm gonna make it awesome. eeeeeeeee! and everyone can come visit me..its only like a 40 dollar plane ride...no biggy. :)

one more weekend of my other oliver and then i'm done with musicals till the summer. it'll be nice to breathe.
:)
life is good.
hope eveyrone else is doing well :)"

"event","in the past 2 days..i've all of a sudden developed a fear for college.
i need to quit that.

i think i'm going to go to buffalo.
officially.
i'm going to tell them this week it's where i want to go.
and it'll be fine.
and things will be good.

woot :)

i mean..if there's only 10 people in the program, i'll obviously get the attention i need. and boy do i need attention lol.
so it'll be fine. really fine.

"event","so disreguard my emo entry about penn state.
:P
i finally got into a theater program, so i'm pretty excited.
i was gonna give up on theater all together to be completely honest because i didn't think i was going to get in anywhere.
but, i finally got into the theater program at buffalo, which i was surprised about because i was sick for my audition..and they only accept 10 people..and there were 70 people at just my day of auditions. 25 of which were guys. craazzyyy.
so i think i'm gonna go there. officially. it has an amaazinngg theater, and the choreographer/dance director is SO INTENSE. and i like that :) it was my other number 1 with penn, but i didn't think i was giong to get in at all because i thought my audition was so bad, so i tried not to build it up into anything, you know?
so i dont know. i'm pretty happy about things.
life is good.
indeed.
hope everyone else is well :)
cya soon

"event","i've been busy. and tired. and grumpy.
but its all good.
friday-saw veronica and various others in 42nd street. loved it :)
saturday- had pops, sang national anthem with kate and jackie, then sang with singers music from ""wicked"", then sang ""reviewing the situation"" from oliver. and wanted to die but whatever :)
its cooool
and then i went to friendlys and hung out with some cool kids (such as leara/kayla/court etc etc) it was nice :)
then i've just been running from play rehearsal to play rehearsal. ridiculous.
its fun though...i mean its always fun. its what i love so obviously its fun.
but i just need a day to know that i have nothing to do, and so i can just relax. :)

i have a lot of crap to do/get done by tomorrow. lets see how it goes.
things really are great though.
:)

i cant wait to see katarina in west side this weekend eeeeeee!!!
hope everyone else is well :)

"event","so i dont know.
things have been crappy.
thats how it goes sometimes.

pops concert saturday. i'm scared to have to sing my song. which is weird for me.
but whatever. i have to learn the song first..that might be nice.

in case you're wondering..things will get better.
everything bad just happens ALL at the same time always.
its crazy that way.

but whatever.
oh. and just to let you know..trying to balance out 2 plays..of the same exact play..and trying to work a job...and stlil make it to college auditions-prepared and ready...and doing everything else in the world that i do..can cause a little bit of stress.
yes. a little bit of stress.

but. my sister makes me happy
and so does grilled cheese..and tomatoe soup..with one cookie :)
delightful!

have a nice day :)
seriously, do it."

"event","so i've been at pennstate since thursday night, and finally came back saturday night. i loved it though. i sat in on some classes for musical theater students, and then i saw their musical ""the boyfriend"" which i absolutely loved. such a good play :) so funny!
and then i had my audition this morning, which lasted from 8:30 am-3:30pm. and if that seems like a  long time..thats because it IS a long time. longest audition ever.
first we had the jazz and ballet, which went well.
then we had the vocal/monologue audtiion, which went really well.
then they asked 10 people out of the 70 there to stay for an interview and callback audition, which i was asked to do (and if you didn't get the callback, it menas they dont even consider you for admission. so luckily i got one!) and that went well too. and then they asked me to stay for ear training and sing backs, which went fine.
so i dont know, i just have to wait and see!

and then i went to the browns and saw cori and various other cool epople :)
annnnddd then i went to learas :)
and now here i am.
and school starts again monday.
ba humbug."

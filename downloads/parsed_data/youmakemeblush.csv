"event","I just went through and changed the security settings on a ton of old posts. Everything old should be private now. I logged out and checked to make sure none are public, but if someone could check to see if I left any friends-only, that would be awesome.

I figure it's about time to put the past behind me. I feel like I'm over all of the silly nonsense I used to write about and the not-so-silly emotional struggles. I've moved on into a new chapter of my life.

Here's to the future."

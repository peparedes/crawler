"event","SYNOPSIS: In the year 2014 an economic crash in Japan sent much of its population immigrating westward in search of greener pastures. In the back alleys of an undisclosed part of Asia lies the city of Mallepa. This cultural melting pot has become the home of many a lost soul in search of a place to call their own. It is here that Sho, orphaned and living on the streets with a gang, saves the life of a dying vampire who soon becomes his closest friend.

Through the following years friendships are formed and hardships endured. This surrogate family learns firsthand how the passing of time and the struggle for power can destroy the innocence of youth and the ties of friendship as they are unable to escape from the fight for power involving the gangs of Mallepa.

CLIP: In this scene, Kei suggests that Sho may be better off without him, much to Sho's annoyance.

ORIGINAL CAST:
Sho - Camui Gackt
Kei - Hideto Takarai (Hyde)

"event","What better day to see a doctor about heart problems?

Dr. Vallone is a round man with dark brown hair and black eyes. His skin is slightly dusky due to his Hispanic heritage, and his hands are rough. He is the type of man that can be well summed-up as fat and jolly. My grandmother has been seeing him for a few years now, and trusts him.

I was given an EKG and he listened to my chest. From those he said that my heartbeat is regular, and that it doesn't sound like I have a severely prolapsed valve (I lack that old tell-tale clicking.) In fact, he said that he didn't hear any irregularity in my heart beat. In his opinion (which he gave to me reluctantly) my former cardiologist Dr. Martyr may have pegged the wrong cause for my problems. According to Dr. Vallone, even if I did have a valve problem and it was regurgitating bad blood, it would not be causing the intense pain that I am feeling. 

And so I am left with less answers than I started out with.

Right now we are testing to see if my chest problem is related to my anxiety problems. It is possible that whenever I feel that my heart is racing, it is caused by a panic attack. I rather doubt that this is the case. I do not feel anxious whenever my heart starts beating, and it is not the same as the increased pulse rate I do feel during a panic attack. When I'm panicking, my heart rate is accelerated, but in a normal fashion. What I am experiencing right now feels more like tachycardia, which I was diagnosed with by Martyr. I can be doing absolutely nothing. laying bed, and my heart starts pounding very quickly, so hard that I can not breathe and I feel like I will pass out. I understand, though, that it is best to explore this path. Vallone has given me a mild sedative with the instructions to take it if my heart begins to race. If I find that my anxiety goes away and my heart fixes itself up, splendid. However, I don't think it will.

I am currently wondering if I have angina, a narrowing of the blood vessels. A thought, really. I am certainly no doctor, nor is WebMD, but sometimes it gives me new paths to explore. For instance, there is Variable Angina, which is not linked to CAD and often occurs at rest between midnight and early morning. I have noticed that my problem is much worse late at night. Variable Angina is a spasm of the arteries and can be caused by vasoconstricting medications.. and I know that Lexapro does constrict the arteries. Sadly, I did not look into this until after seeing Dr. Vallone because I was under the impression that this was MVP, and nothing else. 

*sigh* Where do we go from here? First the anxiety test to see if things get better when I am sedated. If they do not, the cardiologist. How terribly exciting.

Perhaps the problem is that my heart is bubbling so full of my love for humanity that it hurts. Or maybe my heart is just three sizes two small. I'd gamble on the latter before the former."

"event","I have just written the most amazingly funny thing ever, and I won't put it here but I will brag about it. I am sooo amusing. So very very amusing. Even I am amused by just how amusing I am.

Bryan and I watched Chamber of Secrets again today. Oddly enough, I don't think I can get tired of that movie. The third one, certainly, but Chamber of Secrets is something special. Also, the dueling club scene is my favourite from all the movies. Oh, you sexy beast, Snape.

As much as Bryan makes fun of my borderline obsession with Harry Potter, he does love talking about it. Two nights in a row now we have had long talks about aspects of the magical world and why certain things are the way they are.

A couple of questions have arisen:

Is it okay to kill someone during a wizarding duel?

Does anyone ever pull a knife or gun in the magical world?

Why don't evil wizards use the Killing Curse more often? They are evil, after all.

And, the most troubling one that we keep coming back to:

Why doesn't Snape just pack up and own everyone around him?

There is a point there. Obviously he is a powerful wizard, with numerous strengths. The man is a whiz (ho ho) at potions, knows half a million curses and counter curses AT LEAST, can read minds and keep his own from being read.. what keeps him under the thumb or Dumbledore and/or the Dark Lord? He certainly isn't a weasling follower like Malfoy, and he must have some ambitions. There must be some deeper part of his character that I am missing. Very interesting.

And, just to make the circle of nerdery complete, I have now joined a Harry Potter based roleplaying forum, set in an American school. We'll see how that goes.. so far I am still waiting for people to SELL ME MY SUPPLIES before I can go to class. Mr. Snape was kind enough to sell me a wand (why is Snape working in an American wand shop? To get tail, obviously!) but I'm stalled out on books and a robe.. and no one even seems to be in the cauldron shop. I joined as a first year student, because I wanted to get the whole 'ooh, magical school' experience, but it seems rather more popular to be an adult and snog in the backrooms. Of course, I can understand that, though I'm a bit too shy to do it myself. I wonder if anyone ever plays McGonagall? Poor dear lady never gets any love. Maybe I'll make a McGonagall character.

MCGONAGALL SEX!

M: Oh.. oh my, Hagrid. I know you are half giant, but I must say I never considered that.
H: Heh, well you know what they say about blokes with big feet, Professor. Why don't yer put on the cat ears again for old Hagrid?
M: Yes, of course.. are you sure you don't want the tail, too?
H: Uh, no mum. Tickles me nose and all.. wouldn't want ter be sneezin' on yeh.

"event","Onto more important (yet rather more depressing) topics. 

After a long and somewhat insulting talk with Jennifer on Saturday, it was decided that I would be scheduled to work this week. I say 'it was decided,' but I certainly don't mean that I had much input in the process. As it was put to me, I had a choice of either pushing myself to work, or losing my job. Of course I understand; this is how business is run. However, I think Jennifer has handled the whole thing very poorly.

Jennifer is one of those unbelievably gauche people who think that proceeding every sentence with 'no offense' gives them license to say anything they please. A most distasteful personality trait. I would prefer a person come straight out and bitch-slap me, rather than mince around with terms like 'no offense' or 'in my opinion.' As soon as someone says one of those, I am expected to give them carte blanc to insult me.. after all, they said they didn't mean to offend me. It is a twisted, foolish logic.

Moving right along.

Not wanting to lose my job, I felt forced into taking hours this week, despite being unready to work. Mentally I am more than set to get out of my bedroom and make some money, but the flesh is still pitifully weak. Ah, but 'no offense, if you don't come in this week it's going to be a job abandonment' decided things for me. 

I have managed a store, and I know what job abandonment is and isn't. Job abandonment is 'Hmm, Brianna was supposed to be in today, and she isn't. Nor did she call. In fact.. I don't think she's been here her last three shifts!' It most certainly isn't the same as 'I have a short-term disability and can not work, as you are fully aware.' Surprisingly enough, that is called 'short-term disability.' Genius, that.

However, I also know better than to argue with an authority figure who thinks they know better than I.

Sunday night was awful. My heart would not stop pounding long enough for me to sleep properly. I certainly lay in bed for 8 hours or so, whatever good that did me. I know some of it was stress/fear of not being able to work. Jennifer had told me that if when I came in I was unable to work my full shift that I would be all but forced to quit. Again, I understand that unless I am working I am dead-weight on their payroll, but the thought of quitting still hurts. And so I went in.

And failed miserably.

I held on for a good hour and a half before the pain became too great. When my heart started beating hard enough that I couldn't breathe properly, I approached Marcos.

Amazingly, Marcos (read Store Manager) has a better answer to my problem: Short-term Disability.

TADA, and we've come full circle.

I told him about my conversation with Jennifer, and asked him how to go about putting in my two weeks. He acted a bit shocked and brushed it off. Instead, he is contacting HR and seeing what we can do about putting me on actual disability leave.. not this fake 'I don't want you on the floor so go home for a week' leave that Jennifer sent me on. The only thing I should need now is a doctor's note.

WHICH should come much more easily than it would have a week ago, now that Grandpa has offered to send me to his cardiologist. That is some good news there. Very good news.

In the end, things are actually looking up. I'm not making any money right now, but the chances I will get fired are down. And, as Grandpa asked me to be scheduled on emergency status, I should be seeing a doctor soon, maybe within the week. And then.. cured?

A note on Grandpa: My parents are not always the most helpful or supportive, but sometimes Grandpa comes through and saves me, unexpectedly. I think Grandpa is actually one of those people who can be classified as 'a great man.' Not just because he saves my ass sometimes; he truly is a good person. Knowing that he cares enough about me to help me see a doctor gives me new resolve to fix this. I had lost most of that. I need to find some way to properly thank him."

I think everyone did a rather nice job, especially the girl who played Mitsuki. This is her first time, but she's already doing pretty well. Windy-chan came down on her rather hard in her review; I'm disappointed with Windy. She speaks her mind without thinking of how it will make others feel, and generally I agree with what she is saying. However, in this case it seems like she thought either she or someone else deserved the role more than the 'newbie' did, and somehow thought it was smart to let her review reflect that.

I am considering coming down on her for 'that statement' but my instinct to avoid drama has prevented me so far. Here is a hint: If you don't want to 'get in trouble' for saying something, maybe your should bite your tongue. She also said that I didn't sound 'old' enough. Hmm."

"event","Last night's dream:

There was a war going on, a massive war that the government and media somehow managed to clean up the evidence of every night. A lot of us had taken refuge in a school building, counting on its concrete and steel structure to shelter us from the storm. The dream was actually quite long and broken, but I will record one amusing part of it.

I approached Stephen Bull (a boy from freshman year) with my pen-knife out. He is a watery-looking man, with mid-length frazzled hair that starts high on his forehead and a nose that could cut a steak, on which he wore large unfashionable glasses. Often he would die his hair blue, without much success, and he was known for wearing zoo shirts with bats on them. In reality, I'd give maybe one hoot for the boy. In the dream, I approached him with my pen-knife and said 'Kneel down. I have something important to give you.'

The other refugees gathered round in a ceremonial circle, some wearing hoods to hide their faces. I placed both my hands on either side of his face and stared at him for a moment, then using my knife cut a zig-zag ala Harry Potter into his forehead. 

'It is done. Now you are my arch-nemesis, Stephen Bull.'

And so he was. The rest of the dream he was antagonistic and irritating.

The only other part of note was a tsunami that caught up my father and many other refugees from the roof of the destroyed school building. As the waves pulled in and out, the spray frothed with blood, forming a tower of sickly sea green topped with pale red. I remember thinking it looked like watermelon."

I told Bryan today that I am thinking about joining an online Harry Potter rpg. This spawned a discussion about ridiculous (and yet, not entirely unlikely) ideas for Harry Potter characters.

Benabus Black- the anthropomorphic and secret son of Sirius Black as Snuffles and a female dog.  Falls in love with Hermione after the poly-juice accident.

Melissa Snape- The daughter of Severus Snape and female Snape from ANOTHER DIMENSION. Hates her father.. I mean mother.. I mean....

Azreal Morte- The illegitimate daughter of the Dark Lord and a crow animagus that he raped as Tom Riddle. She has black angel wings and calls herself the 'Dark Angel of Vengeance.' Likes Snickers bars. (this was a rather sad little joint effort. I think I may have seen this character around somewhere. *sigh*)

The fun never ends over here. Meanwhile, I should really work on my character. I need to find a way to make her interesting without being over the top. So far I've decided that the name is Virgil, and that Virgil is an orphan (I don't want to make up parents and all that jam.) He is shy and reserved, and imaginative. He dreams of being something important and famous.. like an actor, or maybe a monster hunter! I'm not actually sure if he's male or female.. or a female posing as a male. I like the sound of that, but it may be too melodramatic. Bah.. help me, ::myprivatehell78::!

I think I may watch the extras disk for Dogma. What could lull me to sleep better than over 100 minutes of outtake footage? It's like an entire new movie, but disjointed and not funny enough to warrant actual screen time! As I told Bryan, it can really only be worth it if half of it was composed entirely of Alan Rickman's ass.

Sadly, I don't think that is the case."

"event","February 1st is my sister's birthday; she's survived 22 years thus far, and so we celebrate. Or at least, we do if we aren't my parents.

Bah, I can't believe them! Traditionally the four of us get together for birthdays and go out to eat. Every year, on every birthday. This year Shannon decided to go to Don Pablos because her day happened to fall on $8 fajita night, and they make you wear a silly sombrero. A fave. Simple. Yet somehow, insta-drama!

Brianna got to have her boyfriend come to her birthday dinner, but Shannon is currently single: Can Shannon bring her best chick friend?

NO.

What if said chick friend pays her way?

NO.

Okay. A tad odd, but we're used to this sort of family peculiarity, and Shannon is planning a party for her friends Saturday. Fair enough. And yet..?

Apparently my mother has been weasling all week, trying to get out of tonight's dinner. Jim scheduled a root canal today, he'll be in a bad mood (okay,) Brianna is having heart trouble (I wasn't concerned,) let's just do it another time. Next year, perhaps? When she found out that Shannon and I planned to meet to do some shopping before dinner, she decided that we probably couldn't make it in time (what's the rush?) and maybe we should celebrate without them? You and your sister should go out together (but oh, my aching heart!) Oh, I guess she could come over later for cake or something.. eh. 

So now I have an upset sister waiting for me in the parking lot of Target. Poor dear. I know they don't approve of they choices she makes and the way she lives, but damn it, it's her fucking birthday. For Christ's sake! No matter what she does, she's their daughter, and that makes her important. At least for one day of the goddamned year.

It's a good thing Elder Sister came to the rescue. 

'Hey.. there's a Don Pablos right next to here. Let's get you a nice shirt to wear to dinner, call your friend, and the drinks are on me.' 

So we did. We browsed the Clearance section and I got her two nice little shirts and a jacket and beret for myself, then party favours at Wal-mart. Then it was off to Don Pablos for fajitas, tequila shots, and lechery. Best chick friend Silvia joined us, and we had a smashing time. Really. According to Shannon, it was the best birthday she's ever had. I'm glad I was able to give it to her.

*wags finger* That doesn't mean you are at all off the hook, parents. I'm still pissed (in more ways than one, ho ho!)

Good night."

"event","Ah, pornographic e-mail, you never cease to amuse me. 

Not a very eventful day, and yet I am cheerful enough, despite being awake at this ungodly hour. Actually, this gives me time to write in my journal now that the cat and the Kit are both sleeping. They're so demanding.

Woke up today in time to watch the last two-thirds of Man in the Iron Mask with Casey. I will give it to Casey that his historical insights sometimes prove interesting, like his explaination of the dialectical differences in France during the time period in response to my complaint about the incongruent accents. According to him, it is believeable that there would be French, English, and even somewhat American sounding accents in the story. Not that the filmmakers were thinking of that, I am sure. It's probably just easier not to ask Mr. Leonard di Caprio to strain himself.

Regardless, I'm rather fond of the movie. I remember seeing it when it came out with my friend (who was a Leonard fangirl,) determined to hate it, and cheering at the end when the Musketeers appear out of the smoke. I also remember thinking 'Hmm.. that Aramis guy is REALLY hot.' Oh, REALLY? Poor dear, I didn't know about Jeremy Irons at the time. I had actually forgotten he was even in the movie until he came on the television. The scraggly Jesuit look still suits him. *sigh*

Note to self: Find more Jeremy Irons movies. Hunt down Bryan's copy of Lolita.

Note to self: John Malkovich is a poof.

Later Bryan and I watched one of his new 70's exploitative horror movies. I'm not sure if most of them can truly be considered exploitation films, but there was a period that birthed a lot of horror movies, particularly in Europe and Japan, which focused on the three B's: Breasts, Butts, and Blood. Plot was, of course, an issue, but it always allowed for plenty of naked chicks walking around showing themselves off. I love it. There is a simplicity there, a near-innocence that the R-rated movies of today seem to miss. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but scenes of girls dancing around in loin-clouts are much less offensive to me than, say.. Bram Stoker's Dracula. Or Jerry McGuire. Really, name any movie that earned an R-rating for sexual scenes circa 90's plus, and I probably hated it. Sex is so much dirtier now than it used to be.

The Devil's Plaything was amusing enough. The centuries-old spirit of a lady vampire seeks every nine years to posess the body of a young girl of her familial line, with the help of her priestesses. Only a doctor and her magical cross of garlic can stop them.. but is it to late to save herself? The themes of the movie are obvious: Lust is evil. Women who allow themselves to be controlled by lust are evil. A very common theme in these movies. Maybe that is what makes them so dear to me.. in the end, all those nude dancing scenes were to show the wickedness of animal lust (okay, and TnA.) There is that slight wag of the finger there unpresent in today's 'Insert Fuck Here' movies. 

Or maybe I just like them. Bah, I refuse to be embarrassed anymore."

I promised myself that there would be no more fighting game names after the chinchilla was dubbed Evil Ryu, but Voldo is such a sweet name. As in TOTALLY SWEET.

For the ah.. naive? Untainted of you out there, Voldo is a character from the Soul Caliber series of games. He is a blind dancer/slave, who uses his flexible body and nonexistant fear of gravity to freak out all over the place, confusing and injuring his opponents. I'm sure there is a much better, technical description of him, but I haven't the time nor care to copypasta it. Something about searching for the Soul Edge for his master, who is dead, and then killing people to feed the sword. Blah blah. He just so happens to use Cat's Claws as one of his unlockable weapons. He also just so happens to be my best character.

Bryan suggested the name, and it does suit the kitten. He is always flipping all around to claw at us. I swear he is able to fold himself in half backwards. Odd cat. Also.. Voldo is an adorable name. It's distiguished, a little gothic, a little effeminate. Perfect for a cat. 

And so, the kitten is named Voldo.

The door opens, and I hear a woman with a husky voice all but yelling 'It's okay! I'm just kidding with you!' Great.. a boisterous elevator occupant. Ah, but it was worse than that.

A middle-aged woman with lank brown hair, wearing a housecoat and carrying a large purse, a canvas bag, and a trash bag enters the elevator, along with a rather off-put looking Indian man. I can tell that the trash bag holds clothes. She moves to the back of the box, and starts writhing on the wall like a nun in religious ecstasy.

Maybe.. I'll try to justify her crazy here. Maybe she was pregnant, and her water broke, and she was starting to go into contractions and needed a ride to the hospital. That would explain the bag of clothing, and the flailing about. Maybe.

Or maybe this explains why such a nice apartment complex is so cheap this close to the capital."

I feel a little bad, but we did go through other avenues to find his owner. Bryan had the leasing office call everyone with a cat listed in their lease, and even went door to door on the first floor, where we assume the cat came from. We've also put in a claim with the county Animal Control, but somehow without the signs up it all seems half-arsed. One might think we were trying to keep the cat. *cough*

Of course, my lovely roommate has his own views on the subject.

'You know, if you two aren't going to put up signs for the cat, you're going to have to be much more responsible.'

Thanks, Dad. For the time being, I'm not sure how much more responsible we can be after feeding him, cleaning his box daily, keeping him out of the trash and toilet, and making sure he gets attention. If the cat does take up permanent residence here, of course I will get him ah.. altered and vaccinated, but as long as he remains 'not my cat,' I prefer not to spend multiple hundreds on him. Perhaps if Casey is so concerned about the cat, he can take him to the vet on his own dime.

Bah, I wish he would stop acting like he has anything to do with the cat at all, aside for occaisionally over-feeding him. I suppose it is his habit to act like he is in charge every situation. Well, i wish then that if he were so responsible, he would clean up his shit so i don't have to worry about he cat eating one of his damned minatures while I'm at work. And his frozen dinner plates. I'm seething.

In other news, the cat is still nameless. Maybe I should name him Cthulu.. being a nameless horror and all. Ah, I amuse myself. Realistically, I'm rather fond of either Dr. Claw or Malfoy. Dr. Malfoy Claw? Bryan is ambivalent about the whole thing, regardless of having suggested both of those names himself. Malfoy suits him.

There is a difference between 'cute name for a kitty involving personal aspect of said kitty' and 'hurr, this cat looks like it's wearing a tuxedo.' Dr. Claw is an adorable name for an annoying cat that claws everything. Tuxedo Cat is the kind of name a five year old gives his first kitten. Worse, because said five year old is actually a large, surly man of 22 with no real involvement with neither the cat nor us, other than the occasional attempt at a snide comment.

Last thing I need is for him to bitch at me about 'not taking care of myself.' He likes to make up stories about how he never sees me eat anything but Taco Bell, when in truth he NEVER SEES ME EAT. By the time I wake up, he's at work. By the time I get home, he's asleep. Believe me, the lack of contact with him is not a sad thing, but the point is that he is in no place to analyze my habits. Besides which, even were I to eat three meals at Taco Bell a day, it would have no bearing on the condition of my heart. I'm actually supposed to take in more sodium than average when I'm having attacks like this. The unfortunate fact is that I'm slotted to be weak all my life; eating only salads is not going to help that.

Perhaps it would be different if I believed he gave even a bit of a damn about me, but his conviction back in October that I am 'a cunt and everyone knows it' really makes it hard for me to see him as 'caring.' That and all those times he's tried to break Bryan and I apart. He is a miserable person.

How original. Call the black and white cat Tuxedo. Clever clever.

Points to Sean for deciding on Tuxedo Cat because it sounds somewhat like Tuxedo Mask, but that's about the end of the benefits. I veto'ed the idea, and now there is drama. Casey is being a nit about the whole thing. Every day he has picked a name for the cat, and gets all huffy when anyone disagrees.

This happens about once a month.. somebody sets their wok on fire and we're all out in the cold for 40 minutes or so. I keep thinking that next time I'll just ignore it, but I don't want to risk that it may be a real emergency with the chins around. 

A few minutes after we got outside, Bryan saw a little cat streak across the parking lot into the woods. We both said 'Aww, poor lost kitty!' and I was prepared to leave it at that, despite my urge to go rescue the dear thing. We stood there for a few minutes, chatting, when Bryan read my stifled thoughts and said, 'I'm going to go get the kitty.'

Well, he failed. Bryan is very skittish around strange animals (he thinks they all have rabies) and swears the cat went to claw him. I told him to keep an eye on the boys and went to try my luck. The little dear was about as docile as a cat can be. I called him over and scooped him up, and he immediatly went to purring. 

Alarm stopped. Firemen went away. Apartment was clear. We walked into the lobby, now two humans, two chinchillas, and a young cat. I asked the lot in the lobby if anyone had lost a cat. I think that had any of them spoken English, the answer would have been 'no.' Mostly I got some odd looks. 

Bryan decided to knock on the first floor apartments and ask around about a lost cat. That left me to sit on the couch with the animals.

A young girl approaches. She is carrying a newspaper and a shopping bag.

'Ah, hello. Is this your cat?'
'No.'
'Oh. Terribly sorry.'
Silence. Then:

WHAT THE FUCK?

Late to work. Long day. Bryan's birthday. Treated him to dinner. Lobster. That brings us to now.

Bryan has had the leasing office call everyone in our tower with a cat in their lease. So far no one has claimed the kitty (who apparently is a boy, judging from his fuzzy kitty nads.) Meanwhile, we've all become rather fond of the little man. Of course I would like to find his real owners, but I honestly wouldn't mind it if he stays here for a little while. There has even been talk of calling him Diablo (Snape was quickly rejected. I'm still pushing for Sneeper, though.)

As far as I can tell, the strange girl has sat in the lobby all day. Apparently she was there when Bryan came home, and then when I came home, and again when we returned from dinner. Very spooky.

I hope tomorrow is much calmer. I've had my fill of adventure."

"event","My sister gave me the first DVD collection of Dark Shadows for my birthday, and I started watching them today. I was a bit disappointed to see that the collection did not start at the beginning of the show, but rather at episode 210. It turns out that that is actually a very good thing, as 210 marks the debut of Barnabus Collins, who is really the only reason to watch the show at all.

I recall having quite the crush on Barnabus when I was younger. He certainly isn't an attractive man, but I enjoy the character. For those of you not in the know, Barnabus is a vampire who was turned as a young man and confined in a coffin in the family crypt by his own father. He's rather bitter about that, and disgusted by his fate. He attempts to live as a true man, and feeds reluctantly when he needs to. At least, that is the Barnabus I remember. On his debut he seems a little more rash and violent. Of course, I find him terribly romantic.

Let's see.. self-loathing vampire, uncontrollable urges to feed/ use vampire powers, guilt-ridden flashbacks.. tragic character. Check. Archaic manner of speech, courtly manner, snappy dresser.. romantic figure. Check. Intense eyes, aquiline nose, dark features.. classically foxy. Check. 

Ah yes, Barnabus is quite worthy."

"event","Ah, my birthday wasn't really bad as all that.  Went to dinner with my family, Chinese and later ice cream. Friendly's ice cream always manages to taste somewhat.. gamey. My parents and sister bought me some nice video to watch, including the first fourty episodes of Dark Shadows. Very nice.

Afterwards, Bryan and I went to pick up Sean. Sean invited us in, and unexpectedly I got to spend nearly half an hour with his cat Chester. Chester is the dearest kitty you could ever meet. She's entirely lacking that evil spark most cats have; I think that when she was electrocuted as a kitten perhaps it shocked all the bad out of her. Poor dear. She is very beautiful, has soft fur, and a needy little myow. It really was the nicest birthday treat to be able to sit and talk with her. I love Chester. I'm glad she can live with Sean now.. I think being with him makes her very happy.

Later at home Bryan and I shared a bottle of Port and watched the second Harry Potter movie. I could easily become addicted to Port. Sadly, I could not finish the movie because I had to go to bed, but I stayed long enough for the Dueling scene. It is my favourite part. I love to see Snape cast spells, and the play between him and Lockhart is fantastic. To quote Bryan 'That guy must be shitting himself whenever Snape walks up.' Snape does make quite an intimidating (yet oh so sexy) figure as he duels. And.. is it just me, or does he look almost pretty in some shots? Odd.

Well, that is enough open fan-girlery. I think it is now time to secretely watch the interview with Alan Rickman from the extras and hide in my bed. Please, don't tell anyone!"

Ten Points if you answered Snape (the 9th,) but to win the cup your answer should have been ME!

Brianna, born on the 13th of January, will be celebrating her birthday next Friday (lucky me) for the 23rd time. Brianna is a Capricorn, with various Saturnine tendencies to brood, grouch, and become depressed. On the bright side, she supposedly has excellent business sense. Excellent.

I urge you all to come celebrate with me; however, as I will probably be celebrating with my parents, that may not be possible. I will believe, then, that you had every wish to join me on my special day and that you are with me in spirit. *cough* Righto.

My manner at work is the same as it has always been, though I suppose she is right in saying that it is different from that of my coworkers. I have noticed that they seem to be a bit more relaxed than I. To me, the workplace is an entirely different environment than home. Here and with my friends I behave differently than would be appropriate for work. That is the way of things, isn't it?

Ah, in some ways I prefer my more sedated side as I get older. Quietness is a comfort.

On our way out, Jennifer mentioned that she has the day off tomorrow 'So (I) won't see her butt around here' then. I replied that I have the following day off, so she would not be seeing my butt then either. She startled me by saying 'See! Now you're using slang!'

"event","Had a dream that I was back in high school and it was Christmas Eve. For whatever reason I decided to wear my 'Snape costume' to school. Keep in mind that my costume was just as janky as the Harry Potter costume I threw together for Halloween, but instead of a sweater I wore my black dress with the cape. Pro-quality. Went to school and saw the 'That's not a Snape....' bumper sticker, which amused me. 

Unbeknownst to me, the freshmen had planned that day as Harry Potter cosplay day. Great. They had each chosen characters and walked around pretending to be wizards. Somehow this put me in a really sour mood. I was snippy all day, especially whenever people asked me about my costume.

'Hi! I'm Ginny Weasly!'
'Oh, really?'
'Oooh, you must be Professor Snape!'
'No.. I just decided to wear a vampire cape to school today like a twit. Now, leave me alone.'

Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Musical Episode- All lines and songs for Willow. OVERDUE
A Vision Studios: BSSMStars 196 OVERDUE
BSSMR Movie Parody redos
PGSM Act 4 Beryl lines

A bit much on my plate, but I will handle it. I have the day off tomorrow, happily.

Diana put up the cast list for Eclipse: Lilith and Phantasm. I am playing Sailor Uranus, cast as her for the second time in an E-Myu (third if you count Lenkia's singing group.) Another victory earned. Luckily, Diana was able to contact Piccolo to play Mamoru and a friend for Robert, so I will not be covering any males this time. 

However, I was cast as Hiroshi Mitarai in Fai's fandub of PitaTen episode 08. PitaTen is an adorable little anime about an angel in training who attaches herself to an elementary student and his friends. Harmless hilarity ensues. In this episode the students are putting on a play of Kaguya-hime. I think every cutesy school-kid anime has one of those. I play Hiroshi, a rather ah.. exuberant young boy. This is my first time playing a young boy, and certainly the most energetic part I have ever been given. Therefore, this should certainly be interesting.

Dylan, who is producing the Buffy musical, finally got me to turn in an audition for Angel in the RENT radioplay. He is very supportive of my singing, even though we have only just started speaking. I certainly appreciate all of his kind words. And so, I really must get those lines in to him TOMORROW. He said before that turning them in Monday would be fine, but even so I feel like I am late on them. Damn all this illness and business! There are things to record!"

"event","Terribly sick today, even after having slept for fifteen or so hours. I think Bryan may be right in thinking that a large part of it is from not eating enough. I didn't realize it, but I've only been eating once a day, and only then because Bryan made me. I haven't really had any appetite for the last few weeks, and when I am hungry there is never anything around the house to eat so I just ignore it. I've actually lost a bit of weight.. I'm not sure how much, but it doesn't take a lot for me to look too damn skinny. That would definetely account for my weakness and the shakes. On top of that, I seem to have an ear infection. Fantastic.

I've been making myself eat all day, but it is difficult. I just don't want food. A little bit is okay, but if I try to eat an entire meal I feel sick afterwards. I didn't even enjoy the ice cream Bryan bought me. I've had three pieces of bread, half a sandwich, and some canned ravioli, and that was it. Much more than I've been eating, but probably not enough yet. Especially not having been up since 900 Am and working.

Or is it all right to eat that much? What is enough? I suppose I could try watching my caloric intake.

I ended up calling in to work and going late. I feel really bad for doing that on my first day, but I was in no shape to work at 1100. Bryan fed and hydrated me, and I rested until a little after 300. I feel better than I did when I woke up, so I think that was the right thing to do.

I am already very fond of Mexx. Even ill, I felt happy to be there. The store has a good vibe. The clothing is really nice, and bless those Europeans for cutting their sleeves long enough for me to wear. I have yet to try on any pants, but the jacket I tried fit wonderfully. At $99.00 it will be a while before I purchase such a thing, but let's make it a dream. A deep red velvet jacket for Brianna. My late Christmas gift to myself.

Of note is that the in-store music is surprisingly good. We're running a Christmas mix, but unlike most Christmas soundtracks it includes several unthemed songs as well. A much better solution to the season than playing the same twenty badly rendered carols all day. The music was actually hip and happy enough to keep me on my toes. 

I wasn't in best form today, but I worked hard. The Assistant Manager Jennifer took notice and commended me, comparing me to the two employees brought over from the Georgetown store and calling them 'slackers.' Amusing. I did notice that they spent most of the day leaning on tables and chipping about how Jennifer kept trying to run her store (how dare she.) I mostly avoided them and kept myself in the back, recovering clothes and opening fitting rooms. I do like Jennifer, though. She's nice in that 20-something perky way. She seems to appreciate my helping out so far, so perhaps she and Marcos will decide to keep me after the Season. I would really like to stay. It is nice to finally work in a store that carries products I would buy and staffed by people near my age. Jennifer even went so far as to suggest that I try working management. I was modest, but if she rings my bell I will answer.

Speaking of people answering their bells, I finally got in touch with someone in the Lord & Taylor cash office and retrieved my paychecks. No more dealing with that crummy store. I will be happy enough never to go in there again.

I am calling you out, Lord & Taylor. You're clothing is stuffy, your prices are exhorbitant, and your staff is either saccharine sweet or blatantly bitchy. Shame on you, Lord & Taylor. Shame, shame, shame."

All over yuppies, shopping for the latest $700 purse at Coach and drinking Starbucks chai tea. Shannon seems to love it there, but I have never claimed to understand her. She insisted upon buying me a $5 pair of underwear from Victoria's Secret, which I am now wearing and I honestly can't tell any difference between them and the Japanese panties I buy for a dollar a piece at the little Asian store.

Some good did come fromt he trip, however, as I am now in possession of the oh-so-coveted retail job I have been convinced I would not get. No, it isn't at H&M (who can go fuck themselves,) nor at EB Games (oh, they're all right,) but at a small clothing shop called Mexx. I spoke briefly to the manager yesterday when I turned in my application, and expected a call from him today to schedule a formal interview. I got a call that asked me if $8.50 is fine per hour (it is) and if I could come in and fill out some paperwork (I could.) I am weak, shaky, and have been awake since 6 o'clock, but I went in and did my paperwork and explored the store a bit. I officially start tomorrow. Fantastic!

The store is based in Finland, I believe, and the style is dubbed 'Euro-city.' Think 'metro-sexual.' Bold jewel-tones, black and white. Fitted cuts with a little more length to them than your American styles. Very nice. The staff is my age and friendly enough. I think I may like working there.

During my search, I found a large directory, presumably by some Russian chick, of Alan Rickman pictures. More than even I want, as well as video and sound files and transcripts from interviews. Very interesting. I browsed a couple of the videos, mostly trailers and badly chopped together music videos. Abhorrent. I understand being a fan, and even wanting a reel of your favourite movie moments.. but must you throw them together at random with crappy pop music? *cough* Or lamely attempt to slash Snape and Lupin by mixing every scene of them from POA. I am not convinced.

Here is a clue, fan-girls: Lupin was one of the Maurauders. Snape hates the Maurauders. Sirius tried to feed Snape to werewolf Lupin. Snape hates werewolves. Ergo, Snape hates Lupin. Now, why don't you go back to searching for relationships between him and Lucius Malfoy or something that would at least make a bit of sense?

I do not understand the revolting fan-girl habit of placing the characters they love into homosexual relationships. What's so great about a gay-man? If Snape is drooling all over gents, what room does that leave for me?

The web directory I found also had a lot of *cough* Snape porn in it. And, as it was a directory of stored files and not an actual site, it was impossible to know when a lovely picture of Snape's head attached to some naked guy's body would pop up. I nearly died of laughter. Even were they not poorly Photo-shopped, the plain silliness of them was just too much to be at all sexy. Oh, you fan-girls, you.

I could continue discussing the awful habits of the fan-girl community, but my sister is coming to take me to the mall. She'll be shopping, I'll be turning in applications. I'm keeping my excitement to a dull roar for the time being, but who knows when it may just burst out of control?"

He is so handsome, and I think I am finally getting used to the full beard. While we were watching the movie, I just kept watching him. His profile is so distinctive. After drooling over a stranger for the past week, it is good to step back and realize that Bryan has everything I absolutely want. A sensitive mouth, gorgeous hair that I just want to ruffle, a strong chin, just the right nose, and beautiful eyes that change with his mood from grey-green to turquoise. God, I love my kit. In profile the full beard adds something rugged that I missed before. I'm really not a fan of facial hair, but it suits him so well.

After being told that he would call 'early [last] week' and not hearing a peep, I am not overly hopeful. I will call him at three, but damned if I will show up on his doorstep and beg again.

Bryan is feeling sick from staying up all last night. His sleep schedule has been bad, partially because I haven't been sleeping. Yesterday we ended up going out for breakfast and then going to bed around noon. I actually managed to sleep rather well. I think it was nearly 8 pm when he woke up, and midnight before I came to. I even went back to bed around 4 and was able to sleep again until 10 am this morning. It certainly felt nice to sleep after all this time. I feel like I could snuggle back into bed now, but I should stay up. I'm not sure if Bryan will be going in to work or not. He looks like he is about to crash.

With my motivation for going out and getting a job being so low in the first place, things are not moving well this week. I haven't gotten a decent night since my menses started. I tend to lay in the bed for long hours, thinking of the stupidest damn shit. And, thanks to reading the new Harry Potter book, most of the stupid damn shit is Potter related. SNAAAAAAAAAPE.

It's difficult to get up and go anywhere in the first place, and worse when I feel crappy. I have a general feeling of doom about this whole job thing, anyhow. I think I am going to blow all my money on Christmas gifts and then fake my death. With any luck, the Christmas money will start coming in and I'll actually be able to buy things for my friends.

It snowed last night. Not enough to be anything other than pretty. The trees had clusters of snow on them, and the ground was sparkling. By sunset today it was mostly gone. Not gone enough for me to not have to scrape off my car, but gone. I hate the way the world looks when the snow is melting away. All that's left is muddy slush and sand from the plows. It's pretty depressing.

Shannon is going MySpace crazy. She always meeting someone from highschool and getting together with them. I'm happy for her; I'm too scared to do that myself. Last night she was talking to Sylvia, of all people. I don't really understand. I'm jealous. I really want to talk to Sylvia, but after the fiasco of freshman year I'm pretty sure she still hates me. Sylvia has always been a little scary that way. It is nice to hear that she is doing well, though. I really want to get her name from Shannon, or beg Shannon to have her IM me, but I'm trying to keep my cool. I really can't promise to be the virginal Brianna I was back in highschool, and I think without a total reversion to that she probably wants nothing to do with me. I really need to let go, but somehow she is still so important to me. I wonder when I will finally stop missing her.

I drew a picture today! I've found that I draw much better if I just start sketching and let go, rather than do the whole 'circle-line-skeleton-pose' thing.

Also auditioned for Willow and Tara in a remake of the Buffy musical. Not sure why you would remake it, but it sounds like fun. I guess I just answered my own question.

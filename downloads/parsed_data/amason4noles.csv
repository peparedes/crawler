"event","Ok, so I work on campus - and I love my job. I basically talk to students all day and just hang out online (much like I'm doing now). But two things have happened in the past few days that I just don't understand.

One would think that they would have no problem working with students and that the managers would be the ones that would piss me off . . . however this is not the case!

Yesterday, my manager said, ""Andrew, can you fill this out and make this card?"" I said, ""sure."" Well, I was up front (someone needs to be up front at all times). So, I filled out all the paperwork at my desk and took it to the capture stations - where they were already signed on and ready to make cards. There was NO ONE in our office at the time. When I asked my fellow employee to print the card (as she was applying make-up), her response was, ""Didn't Lee ask you to do it?"" I responded, ""Yes, however, I'm not signed on and you aren't doing anything."" She said, ""Well, it just doesn't make sense for me to do it when she asked you and you have the form."" 

I was floored. Here she was with both computer applications signed on and ready to go in her name and she wouldn't print the card. So, I walked around (abandoning the front desk), took 3 minutes signing on to print a card that required 20 seconds of attention. Ugh.

Then, this morning - another co-worker came in 12 minutes late. She clocked in and then sat back and talked to another associate. Someone came in and need to go to her station, and she responded, ""I'm not signed on."" NEITHER WAS I BECAUSE I DON'T USUALLY WORK BACK THERE! NO ONE volunteers to work the front because they hate talking to students. I don't mind it, so I assume the position every morning. And then, when a mother fucker is late, you are going to clock in and then tell me you aren't even making an attempt to start your day?!

God Damn It! I miss working with adults."

"event","Ok - so things have SLOWED down a lot since the last time I posted. I just finally fixed the internet here, so that's why I haven't posted. Here's the scoop. I'm staying at Steven's for free. It's great because it makes this trip SO much more affordable. I can eat in more (during the day) and I'm not paying for a hotel. Here's the only problem - it's on a military base. The only way for me to get on is when I'm with a DoD member. So, I can leave base, no problem, but I can't get back on. Then, I don't have a cell phone here - so I can't call Steven to have him meet me to get me back home . . anyway, all of that said: I'm stuck on base while he's at work. It's a VERY nice place and I'm enjoying sleeping in and watching TV, but it's sorta getting old.

Basically, I've had a BLAST at night though. BEER is so good. My battery is dying. Anyway, I'm loving the culture here and I will definitely miss it and the weather! lol!

To my brothers and Tally friends: I miss you all, so much! I'll be home (Tally) on Thurs. 5 DAYS!!!

GET READY! I still need a birthday party."

"event","Hallo Alle! 

I hope everyone back in The States is doing well! Boy o' boy - this has been an experience (an amazing one) so far! I wanted to blog everyday, but I just don't think that's going to happen.

My flight from JAX to Chicago was nothing to brag about. I had to walk outside on the tarmac to board my plane. Ugh. Then I met this veterinarian that was specializing in acupuncture. 

Once in Chicago, I met this guy who was famous. I didn't know of him - but you know how some people are REALLY famous in their small circles and usually only to those behind the scenes in those circles? Well he was a musician that apparently was HUGE as a drummer and percussionist in the jazz industry. This other guy that he had just met knew of his work. 

Anyway, I was forced to sit in another terminal because the one where my plane was leaving from was so small. Once I finally was able to move over there, I met the CUTEST OLD MAN! He looked JUST LIKE Geppetto from Pinocchio! He was so TYPICAL German! He talked to me the whole time about not worrying about me not knowing German and gave me places of interest and ""bier"" advice. It was a pleasure meeting him! My flight was great! The food was, surprisingly good! There was this little 7-8 year old German girl that I was about to strangle - but whatever, I was ok.

I began my journey here at 13:20 on Wednesday. (All of Europe uses the 24 hour format - I'm starting to get more and more used to it.) Steven met me at the airport and forgot where he parked the car. Upon wondering through the airport, I ran into Geppetto again! lol! He was, again SO nice and talked to Steven for 5-10 minutes!

Anyway, as soon as we left the airport, we hit the AUTOBAN! Woo WHOO! These Germans and I think alike: Drive fast, but drive well. They are SO courteous on the road. They pass on the left and stay in the right lanes when not passing. It's a novel idea.

The weather was nothing to speak of for most, however it's my favorite: bleak, cold and rainy! Considering we were pressed for time, we hit the fast food. Nothing to brag about, but it was McDonalds! I know, I know - but Germans are, surprisingly, infatuated with American culture. There are Pizza Huts EVERYWHERE!

Anyway, It's great here! You can get beer ANYWHERE and it's all CHEAPER than soda! Ha haa! What BETTER incentive to drink, no?

Anyway, I think we are going to Berlin this weekend. I will keep you all informed and take lots of pictures! I miss you all so much!

Auf Wiedersehen!"

"event","So, the time has come. In 24 hours from right now, I will be taking off on my way to Chi-town! Then, after two boring hours, I will be getting on an overnight flight to FRANKFURT, GERMANY!!! Yippeee!!!!

I couldn't be more happy about this trip. I'm going for two weeks and it's going to be a great time. I'm telling myself these positive affirmations in hopes that they will come true! 

So, my birthday was interesting. I moved furniture and unpacked boxes all day long. I guess that's what grown-ups do. I think I'm probably going to end up going to Chiles or something like that tonight for my birthday dinner. I suppose I cracked birthdays up to be more than they really are -  they are just another day in the week. So tonight, I suppose it's just dinner with the family, right?

Anyway, I think my trip to Germany will be my gift. I'm not complaining - believe me. But to be honest, my parents didn't even get me a card. WTF is up with that? I mean, maybe they will give me one tonight - but I'm not expecting a gift, but a friggin' card?! COME ON!

Anyway, I'm off to pick my sister up from Volleyball try-outs. Tomorrow should be a great day. I'm spending the morning with Samantha (one of my oldest and dearest BFFs) and going to see Bethany and the baby. I'm stoked!

Anyway, BON VOYAGE folks! I will see my Tally folks on Aug 23rd. 

ASM.

PS -  EVERYONE from Tally was asking me to do something for my birthday; so, maybe we can all get together in some fashion on Sat before school starts? Just a thought. L&R."

"event","Ok - I'm know from the top of this I'm going to sound like an ignorant white supremacists. But, just hear me out.

I'm a Social Science Education major and my minors include Spanish and Religion. My education courses are going great; my minor courses are going great. However, as a Soc Sci Ed major, my studies are composed of education courses (that transcend area of study) and then a focus in social studies. This summer session, I am taking two social science classes and one education course. 

My geography class if GREAT! I like the TA, he's funny and interesting to listen to. I just found out that I made a 97 on my mid term! Woo whoo! Anyway, I'm also taking Micro-Economics. Here in which begins my grief. The TA that teaches my sections speaks about, oh, say 43 words of English. When someone asks him something he just gets all bent out of shape because he can't respond and just gives up and moves on . . often leaving everyone in the dark. So, I just found out I made a 35 out of 50 on my test. Ehh. That's a 70. I can't afford to make a C in this class - I need to make all A's and B's to get my bright futures back. 

This also happened to me my freshman year at FSU in my stats class. The TA for my recitation spoke hardly ANY English! How can the professors that they are under allow this to continue?!

I mean, I have NEVER pushed for the US to adopt an official language - however, I'm paying nearly $400 dollars a class to sit here an bitch on LJ about my anger! I am all about cultural diversity. But, it should just be understood, if you aren't teaching a class in a language department, then the class is going to be conducted in standard English?!

Am I off my rocker?! Am I an asshole?!

This year was SO much fun! I started my day off at Keg's Pic-nic-in-the-park. Fun fun fun! Uno with 27 people . . . ok that's a little exaggeration, but still . . . a lot of people!

Then off to the holiday inn - for power hour and slip-n-slides . . . fun!!! My new favorite pass-time. Slip-n-sliding, not power hour. Power hour has ALWAYS held a special place in my heart!!! LOL! 

Anyway, then off to Tom Brown for fuegos artificiales . . . with a little scare of rain, but thankfully the fireworks shifted the rain pattern in the atmosphere and the rain blew away within 15 minutes of starting . . . 

FUCK! I'm class typing this and my teacher just said POP QUIZ . . . brb . . .

::4 minutes later:: 

It's all good . . I got them all right! Yay! Here's to not paying attention in Economics and still passing the quizzes!

Anyway, yesterday after everything had settled down, I went to Yolanda's house to meet her friend who is currently deployed to Iraq. He was incredibly nice and I'm excited he's here for her right now . . .

"event","Alright - so my weigh in was Saturday. 14 pounds!!! Whoo! Anyway, that's all I'm celebrating about it. Reason!? The MINUTE I found out that I had lost weight, I wanted to eat horribly and just have this excuse that ""Oh, I just lost 14 pounds, I can eat whatever I want."" So anyway, I went RIGHT back to FAT PIG status this weekend. :(

This week is crunch time. It's gym time. It's back to seriousness . . . I promise.

I was driving home today from Palm Harbor and I decided to cross the Courtney Campbell Causeway on my way back to 275. Reason? Well, I wanted to drive down a beach and see people - people all hot and shirtless - people all wet from the salt water and coronas in their hands - people that I . .  not WANT TO BE, but people who inspire me . . . I want that . . . I want to be cool with being shirtless. I know it sounds stupid to those that read this and are thinner, but you have NO IDEA what that desire means!

Anyway, I got all the inspiration I needed! Lol! I'm in the gym Monday, I'm eating right and I'm ready to change. So, 14 pounds from my start date . . . but, I'll check back on Friday. One week challenge - 2 pounds. Come on - two pounds?! I got 'dis.

"event","So, today (Monday) is DAY 6 of my 10 day detox. So far, things have been great! I mean, in the past, I have ALWAYS cheated (even in the first few days) and I have just regretted it an stumbled and ended up eating shitty again. However, this time - I haven't cheated at all! Yay! Go me! It's as if once you give up something, it comes around MORE THAN EVER! Still no drinks since last Monday. Seven days sober . . . hey, that says a lot considering I normally need to be drunk every night to get through visiting my parents! Lol! Anyway, I haven't weighed again since the first one and I am not sure how I'm doing. I'm feeling full most of the time and I'm relatively content not eating the shitty stuff I normally would.

Anyway, I'm going to the gym this evening. I'm planning on weighing there, just so I can get the figures on THAT scale. I will be able to weigh with the original scale Saturday morning. So, look out for a LJ post Sat morning! Wish me luck at the gym - and I'll let you all know how things go Sat.

BTW, starting in the fall . . . PLEASE don't say things like, ""oh, come on Andrew - just one slice of cake."" Or ""Come on - it's free beer."" Or ""Come on Andrew, chicken (wings - fried and tossed in sauce) is a healthy dish.""

Anyway, so I wanted to give you guys the two day results. And, I didn't really want to put my actual weight out there - but, here goes. When I weighed on Wednesday, I weighed 305. There, I said it. I have never broke 300 and it hurt SO badly to look at the scale that day. Well, I wasn't due to weigh in until day 4, but I needed to know for myself how I was doing. So, this is day 3 and I woke up, feeling accomplished (see below), I knew I needed to solidify this feeling of achievement . . . so, I stepped on the scale - and . . . drum roll . . . 297! That's 8 POUNDS!!! I'm so proud of myself. 8 pounds in three days! I know that it's just because it's kicking off the loss, but hey, what better way to kick off my weight loss than to lose nearly 1/11th of my goal?!?! Anyway, I had to share my excitement with you all!

Not that I'm endorsing anything, but if anyone wanted to know what I'm doing, the link is http://www.firstfitness.com/sudslim/about/ss_challenge_flash.asp .

Anyway, my story about last night - 

So, I ran into an old friend that I haven't seen in over a year. Anyway, we got really excited and decided to ""go out for drinks."" Anyway, we went to two great little places downtown (Fernandina) and had a ball! Anyway, neither bartender was carding. So, hello temptation! Anyway, one of the guys we were out with, didn't believe (apparently) that I was 110 pounds overweight and decided I didn't need to diet and that I needed to drink with them. I stood strong. I asked him to not, but he bought me a beer anyway! So, to humor him, I put the long neck (oh so cold chilled, almost like a new born taking it's first breath - never felt so good) to my mouth and just PRETENDED to swig it! Anyway, one of my other friends that was with me drank it quickly for me. But anyway, it was just CRAZY tempting to have a beer to my lips and not drink it.

Anyway, I can do this - I know that I can. I have decided that I may allow myself a beer every 20 pounds simply as a reward to hitting a bench mark . . .

Anyway, this is crazy long and I apologize, but I have to use this medium as a way to gather my own thoughts and reflect.

"event","Alright - so it's time to put LJ to good use. I have an issue. Considering most people that are on my friends list are my brothers, I need everyone's help. I'm overweight. ""WHOA! WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?!"" Yea, no big surprise to anyone - that's not blind. . . but it's time I do something about it. I have about 110 pounds to lose to be at a healthy weight. So, here is what I figure. I am willing to give up drinking to aid in my dieting endeavor until my 21st. Right now, it's June 20th. My 21st is Aug 5 of next year. I hate to do this, but one of the only ways that I am going to make myself lose weight is by forcing myself to give up something I love - booze. Anyway, My goal is to be 110 pounds lighter on my 21st. If I'm not, then I don't deserve to celebrate. I have 411 days from right now to loose 110 pounds. That's basically 11 months. 10 pounds a month is an obtainable goal.

My aunt is a distributer for this OVERLY successful dieting program (I won't use this as an advertisement platform). I am starting this program now, hoping that it will at least give me a good start. The first phase of this program is a 10 day detox. So, here goes. I am putting this out there because I need support. I need to be encouraged and I need to feel support in good times and a nudge to straight up in the bad. So, here - I'm asking each of you to check up on me and force me to admit my results to you all. Also, I was thinking of using my LJ as a food diary and just blogging everyday about my experience. 

Anyway, this is basically a cry for help - you all have been so supportive in everything else I have done and have supported me, emotionally, for the past six months. So, let's keep it up - help me out. Be there for me. DON'T INVITE ME OUT TO PLACES WITHOUT OPTIONS . . . encourage me not to drink until my 21st. It's a reward for me, and it also isn't worth the calories.

Leslie was hosting a low key (so it was supposed to be) cheap beer (which PBR is now one of my favorites) and card night. Considering she didn't know where the cards actually were for a while, a few of us just hung out in the living room and watched ""Who KILLED Roger Rabbit"" (according to Emily). 

**Correction: I have been informed that Diana was the one that made the comment about KILLED. I don't remember it that way - but, so be it.**

Anyway, it was a jolly good time that turned into cards being incorporated into drinking games. Yay! I love drinking games!

There were several times I saw myself detached from the situation; it was as if I having an out of body experience. It was in those moments when I would look around and see the laugher and the warmth that radiated from everyone in the room. Everyone that was there (except for 2 people) were brothers of mine and I was just delighted that I have come into such an amazing circle of people and I'm eternally thankful for being able to experience college the way I do.

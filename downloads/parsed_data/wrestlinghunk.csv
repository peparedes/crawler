"event","I just got back from New Orleans from a kick ass concert it was EISLEY,REGGIE AND THE FULL EFFECT and NEW FOUND GLORY. If you get a chance to see EISLEY in concert go they will be at the Parish in the House of Blues in New Orleans on July 4.One of the biggest plus is they are one of the more personable band i ever met.They signed there cd, took pictures and talked to all the fans.I will be a fan because of that forever. New Found Glory was so good in concert the rocked the house. Reggie and the Full Effect was also awsome in concert

ciao

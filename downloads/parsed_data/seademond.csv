"event","I have stumbled upon a new theory of mine regarding George W Bush and his cronies. I have mentioned on at least one occasion that I believe in the possibility of the existence of alien life forms. That they have paid us regular visits throughout our history is up for debate obviously. If indeed they have visited our humble little world, this is my theory regarding their relationship with George Walker (I think that 'l' should be an 'n') Bush. 

HE WAS ABDUCTED!!!!! 

At some time in his life, GWB has bad a close encounter of the fourth kind. They performed a multitude of violating experiments upon him. During the course of these experiments something, possibly made of cork, was left inserted in a certain part of his anatomy. I'm not saying that this is where the expression ""Man, he's got a cork up his butt"" originated (that's another story). But, just think! This theory would explain so many anomalies about GWB. Maybe, just maybe, it was left in there in the mad rush to get him off the ship and back to where he belonged. Understandable really. Also, he may have done the Earth a great service. After abducting a human of superior intellect (our dear GWB) they would most certainly put all plans of an invasion on an indefinite hold. Well, he has to have done something right so forgive me for grabbing madly in the darkness to try and find an example. Anyway, that's my theory, which is to say that it the theory that is MINE. 

I have another theory you know. 

There are pandas in China. Not just ordinary pandas. MARAUDING PANDAS!!! They're really quite scary, terrorising entire villages and running off with nuts and berries. I believe that there is a cover up at the highest level of Chinese government. This is for several reasons: 
1. -Tourism- Who's going to want to go to a place where at any moment they could be beaten up/eaten by a savage panda. A panda gone wild you might say! 
2. -What zoo is going to request that a panda be displayed within their walls when at any minute it could start marauding. 
3. -Popular opinion would change overnight. Pandas will be seen as bloodthirsty and mean OMNIVORES, instead of the relatively peaceful herbivores that we all believe them to be. 
4. -The sale of soft panda toys (mostly made IN China) would come to an abrupt end. I know no parent that would by their child a soft toy based on a savage man-eating, malicious creature (except dinosaurs, sharks, crocodiles, tigers, lions, grizzly and polar bears and koalas). 
5. -All video footage of pandas that has come from China would be reviewed to see if we in the West had missed anything. This would create an unheard of distrust of China in Western government, media and society at large. This is the last thing they want at the moment as who is going to believe them when they say they would love to give Tibet it's independence. 
6. - Most importantly- they don't want me to be right!!! And that hurts to my very core. 

So, I hereby call upon governments of the world to send a team of inspectors into China to validate my claims and find the marauding pandas. I believe it will be even more successful than the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. i am preparing to create a set of playing cards depicting the most dangerous of all the pandas. There will only be 52 cards as within the ranks of the Chinese marauding pandas, there are no jokers! 

Incidents of marauding pandas are not isolated and they appear to be happening on a much more calculated scale. It is only a matter of time before the pandas find themselves crossing the borders into Nepal, Mongolia and Russia. Pandas know not of borders and peace treaties they maraud with reckless abandon. They are devilishly clever and hold grudges against all that is human. Has anyone seen Terry Gilliam's fim ""12 Monkeys""? That's nothing. If it were ""12 Panda's"" there would be nobody in our future to return to our time and investigate what went wrong. It would be total annihilation. 

Well, goodnight, sleep well and don't let the pandas bite."

"event","Crikey! I'm back on typing during intermission! The show is going GREAT, I mean G-R-E-A-T..... I finally feel as if I'm a professional. The atmopshere is wonderous. Ryan is breathing down my neck right now reading.....his breath smells nice.
 The stage managers are beyond supportive, it makes me just feel good. 
 I wasn't nervous at all. This audience is so welcoming, and is actually giving me energy. I've never feeded off an audience's vibes before, but this time I did.
 It's making me want to do better, I'm not going to tell the other actors how great I think it's going, I might jinx it.
 Weehah! During Edgar Allen I got a laugh. The only bad part is, Kelly and Brett are beyond nervous. Kelly's voice cracked a bit. *Not enough for the audience to cringe* And Bret is moving a little bit faster than he should. But otherwise it's gravy. 
 I've never been a charachter on stage. 10 minutes till we get back cries Sophia.
 Ryan is still there. Sophia thinks we're losers for typing online during intermission. Which we are...Oh by we, I mean me and Derek. *LaughS*
 Brawnson is taking a what type of kiss you are quiz. The atmosphere is great.
 I'm going to go wash my arm right now, as it still has my locker combo on it. And I hate people breathing down my neck. So I'm going to go now. I promise I'll post how the other half went when I get home. Send me good thought vibes...but I doubt I'll need them.
 God bless us all.
Without Wax,
 Spencer Jerome
 P.S. We're really loud.
 P.P.S. Remind me to give my fear rant.
 P.P.P.S. I love this cast, and tommorow will be my 100th time on stage.
 P.P.P.P.S....can you do P.P.P.P.S..... Oh well.
 YAY FOR LIFE!"

"event","Today is the day of Snoopy, so if I post an incomplete thought, it's because I'm leaving. :P
 
 I also would like to state before I proceed, that if you are reading this journal, I probally know you, and I may say something flattering about you, conversely, I could say something very UNflattering about you. I choose not to censor my thoughts here, and I won't censor your comments to my thoughts. But bear in mind, what you're reading is raw and uncensored so viewer discretion is advised. *Laughs* I've always wanted to say that.

 Today has been an interesting date. When I reached my new version, I seriously feel way different. Less attached to everything, but not in a bad way. And I'm still very happy inwardly. Today I actually woke up at the time I set my alarm clock. 4:00, instead of waking, looking at it, groaning and going back to sleep.  Stuck to my workout, and then took a nice cold shower. Not one of my intense showers, just a normal shower. It felt good. But I skipped breakfast. Damn MTV morning music video's being so sexy and tempting that I watch them after meditation till it's time to leave.
  
 I get on the bus, and I had a very interesting conversation with Cameron, and we came up with the greatest game card idea....EVER! The Holy War trading card game. You've heard of Yugi'Oh, you've heard of Pokemon, well here comes Holy War, the game where you wage your religious diety against others. Some popular quotes from playing will probally be...
 ""Holy crap, he's pulled his Jesus card! I'm screwed....Wait I'm playing with a Jewish deck! GO CRUXIFICTION!""
 ""Crap, He's playing his Ressurection card. I better find my God card.""
 ""Raa and God are duking it out! Old school!""
 ""Here comes Satan to defeat my Zeus card. Hahaha! I'll send my suicide bomber card""
 And other fun quotes. You can just imagine the possibilites. I even didn't bug Amber today on the bus. And just had fun talking and sleeping. Sleep is very good.
 
 When I get to school, I decide to hang out with Luke and Co. And have fun there. But apparently, Luke had been thinking about the Holy war trading card game, yesterday in Ellensburg. Which kicks ass....
 Jessie gave me more Riddlyn today. And I'm going to make a small toxin out of the increasing doses I'm getting. For my experiments of course, I need to see about hooking up him and Tracy....I mean he has a crush on her. And she's so soft spoken...Quotes Yenta...""It's a perfect match!""
 
 Math kicked ass today. I still can't get over the fact I'm out of Ms.Lindsey-Iverson's class. It's amazing. More windows, there's computers, laid back enviroment. I'm such a happy bunny. Even though the truth is, all we've done is  tests so far. At least I can do the material...Yay for Pre-Calculus and my ability to actually comprehend and do it!

 Next period was Health, we're in the Career Center. It's funny, according to my tests I'm suited for any job. Though I'm mostly a Protector and a Leader, according to my results. Then when I took the other one, I'm supposed to be the following careers, ones which I'd like to be anyway...
 Cororner- Ok, examing bodies isn't cool. But corpses don't bother me.
 Surgeon-I wanted to be this. Blood doesn't make me squemish. The pay is insane for both of these jobs.
 Cardiologist-See above.
 Fire Investigator(?)- Basically I find out what caused the fire. It sounds cool as well. 
 See I like the whole protector idea. Being a policeman, or a fireman. But the pay just isn't good enough! I want to support a family.  I honestly think a family life is my ultimate goal. No matter the job, nothing else could compare to a loving wife, and children. People who I can watch flourish and constantly help. It sounds like a joy to me.
 Third period flew by. English is so easy for me. I know pick up all I need to know in one reading and then have it memorized, plus my vocabulary is quite expansive. 
 Fourth period....Student Council meeting. We ratified the Stadium Constitution, it made me feel cool. Plus my Freshman senate really does care about me. I just never took time to notice. They had my ""I'm sorry"" sign*More on that later* And smuggled it out for me when Mrs.Thomas wasn't looking. Good peoples, they're just different. So happy.
 Then lunch, and I saw Rachel and Renata. Yet I didn't feel a real need to follow them. Instead I hung out with Chops, who graciously offered to do my word search for me. Then I went and talked to Traci about Jessie. She's still unsure about a relationship, but I'm sure she'll say yes to the lad in time. Ahh...love is a wonderful thing.
 Then I had fun talking to Melissa, who told me not to show Renata and Rachel my, I'm sorry sign. So here's a subrant...if you want to keep on going with my day, or know the sign...move on....
))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
 The first day Rachel and Renata were gone. I was still sick, and felt like they hated me. So I took the initiative of a relativly free day, and made a I'm sorry poster. It says I'm sorry in giant lettering. And has two hundred so's, circling it. Isreal pitched in to help me make it. But when I got better I put it to the side. Still, since people have wanted me to use it. I did. More on how that went at the end. End Subrant.
))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
 Lunch ended, and I was happy. The pop machine gave me what I wanted today. It normally gives me something random and I drink it anyway... Today it gave me what I wanted. 
 Fifth period we were supposed to be cutting up magazines and stuff. Cept I read most of the articles....Man oh man! There are so many problems in the world.....And the populace is kept dark to them. There's a huge conflict happening near Africa. Where a native tribe is fending off some Muslims, and the Muslims are trying to destory their culture. Why the hell aren't we trying to help those guys out?
 Over here...People are running businesses, like myself, at as young as 10. But the thing is, they engulf themselves in them so much, that they miss out on key social situations. And so end up in ruins. I'm glad I took note that being social was a good skill to have.
 To top it all off, there is a place in Japan where people go to commit suicide. WTF? And the thing is...no one does anything to stop it. There are so many suicides...that they are running out of room in that spot...As big as three towns! So screwed up!
 Ok, so I move on to sixth period. And I watch a video on The Population Bomb. Add that to my list of books to read...
 List of books Spencer needs to read before this year ends.
1. The Population Bomb.
2. Fast Food Nation.
3. John Nash's Theroem.
4. *Insert random Japanese text* Basically The White Rose.

 The school day is over, and I decide I want to give my I'm Sorry sign to Rachel. Because it would be a waste of a sign, and I genuinely want to apologize to her. She's just been caught up in the middle of a malestrom. Well, she doesn't catch the bus home. So I end up missing the bus, which is cool with me....because...I talked to a lot of people. And I love people. That's part of my new version. I don't love indivual people, I just love humanity as a whole. It's a pretty good day to be alive...It was also sunny.
 
 Ricky and Sophia plus random drama kids actually asked me to go do something. I politly declined, because I wanted to go to Key Club! Then I realized Key Club must be going on then. So I ran as fast as I could to get there. And I realized that only four people were there. Sam, random other boy, Rachel, and Renata. Damn...no Key Club that day. 
 Sam is obviously hitting on Renata, and Renata is obviously leading him on. They're going on a date tonight. Sam is very nervous. My sincere hope is that Renata likes him. And that she doesn't hurt him. That would be bad for this kid's confidence.
  So I hang out with Rachel and Renata...who just totally blow me off. They don't give a damn about the sign. Which is just as well, because...well....today I saw them for what they were. I just listened to them.
 They gossiped about the two boys they were just talking too. All they freaking do is gossip! Honestly! I hate gossip, I despise it! Say it to these people's faces....Then they kind of pig out, and act childish all around. It slightly disgusted me. The gossip was the worst bit though, it sickened me so much I was ready to go hitch a ride with Myles....God damnit...Oops I swore. I'm trying to stop that.
  But luckily we move near April....April is the sweetest girl. She taught me a whole bunch of sign language. Like gossip, you're ignoring me, rat, turtle, seal, and other things. April is actually a pretty neat girl. Tommorow at lunch I think I'll go and talk to her. She understands about the whole age thing and how it bothers me...
--------------------------------------------------------------
 WARNING SUBRANT! FULL SPEED AHEAD! I fucking hate be younger than other people! It pisses me off so much! I mean, I can't change it. I never thought I'd be a freshman who had other people be prejudiced against me because of my age.
 Oddly enough though, most people respect me. The only people who down talk me, or call me a freshman, or refuse me because I'm a freshman. Are downright childish themselves. Joey Swanson, Rachel and Renata, Corin, Keller. Five of those listed can't even drive. I mean come on, how you going to insult someone when you're exactly like them, cept in a higher grade. I know I can do over half their work in my sleep. And not even bitch...Gah! Stupid people.....
 End Subrant
--------------------------------------------------------------
 Anyway, April is cool beans. She leaves I listen on to Rachel and Renata.  I still think Rachel is wicked cool by herself. I'm not so sure about Renny.  But oddly, I didn't feel like talking around them. Or even at all. This new version of me seems to find such things trivial. There shouldn't be any drama there, and so I won't let there be. I'll just do stuff with Rachel and leave Renata well enough alone. 
 
 Finally, I went home. Am relaxing, and drinking soda. Waiting to leave for the play. So TTL, all. Wish me luck....."

                                           ""Doors""
                                      By:Spencer Jerome 


""Pick a door."" The near transparent thing whispered. Questions roamed my mind...What?Where? But mostly importantly why? Though I could not voice my thoughts..They seemed primal in nature. Unfocused, cluttered. ""Pick a door."" the transparent voice repeated softly.
 I sensed an urgency to make a choice. So I looked at my options. A white door, and a black door, side by side. Slowly I walked up toward the white door, and then I picked up my speed. Yes! This was the door I wanted, I could feel it. It was an urge. The door offered some resistance when I tried to open it. I used almost all of my strength, pushing, I had to get through this door! Slowly I wrenched it open. Blindly I walked in, somehow sensing that the transparent thing was following me.
 Blank....
 I opend my eyes, noticing that I now had eyes, before I had went through I had not. Though the detail didn't strike me as frightening, it felt rather unimportant. I looked for the transparent thing for guidance. It was floating around softly, almost gleefully, I noticed it now had a blue tinge to it's edges, and I felt happy. Very happy. I dilly-daddled around for what seemed to be an eternity, but in this place, time didn't seem to hold any special meaning. It was like there was no time. This also made me happy.
 But suddenly, I noticed there were more doors in front of me. Red, blue, orange, pink and the same black door. For some reason, I had a fear of that black door, so I would stay away from it. I waddled over to the pink door and opened it. Which door I picked really didn't seem to be important. I motioned to my transparent friend to come along. This place had been fun, but I was in a hurry to find out what was on the other side of the door. Drifting slowly the transparent turned as if to get one last glimpse, and then moved on with me.
 Blank....
 I slowly, cautiously entered a new room. A single book lay on the floor, and I could not read the title. Though it's red cover, and golden binding, gave it a certain allure to me and it looked interesting. ""Read it"" the transparent friend told me. I took note that my transparent friend was starting to be less transparent, but it had yet to take a definite shape. I did not question him, something inside me told me that this book was important. I sat down and and I read it. It was hard going at first, but ever so slowly, it got easier. Once I got the first few chapters down, I noticed the others seemed to build on the beganning chapters. It truly was an amazing book, but I'm afraid I don't recall it's contents. Time seemed to be a bit more important, a bit more real. When I looked up, I saw my transparent friend who now resembled a black hat, with a faint transluceny waiting there for me. Patiently. ""Time to move on my friend."" It's voice rang out. I moved heedlessly toward another set of doors, but then stopped myself. Maybe it wasn't smart to just blindly choose a random door. I sat down and I thought about it, about which door I should take. But it appeared the longer I waited, it seemed that the doors seemed to vanish, and then new doors would appear in their place. The only door that stayed constant was the black one, the one I had seen before. It still struck me as a bad choice.  Eventually I settled on a white door with red fringes, though I also thought about the brightly colored door. But I felt the door with red fringes had stayed there longer than the other one. I entered it.
 Blank...
 I was facing a giant wall. It was covered in purple fabric, and it frustrated me. I turned to my left, and I saw a wall of identical build and material. Only to my right though, was a way out. I followed it, but I only came to a crossroad. I took a random side as the choice didn't seem near as important as the doors were. But I found myself starting right at the beganning of this place. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the transparent entity, though now it resembled a briefcase. ""Use me."" it cried. I was happy to oblige, and I opened it. Inside there was a map.
 Now it was not a perfect map, and sometimes it made me end up right at the start. But each time it steered me wrong, it seemed to magically fix itself.
 I moved on at a faily quick pace, and in time I realized I must be halfway there. Do not ask me why, but it was if I could see the doors. But then suddenly, I ran into another person, someone else in this purple fabricated maze.
 It was a girl, and she bore a simliar transparent entity but hers was in the form of an instrument. She seemed lost. But both she and her instrument were beautiful.  And I could feel it from her stare and smile, that she thought me and my briefcase were beautiful.
 Heedlessly, the two of us walked straight onward. Not noticing that together we were going through the maze perfectly.  My briefcase slowly changed into a umbrella, and her instrument, though it always remained an instrument, start to change slowly into a drum. She always kept a steady beat.
 Blank...
 Time once again seemed to slow and have no meaning. It was then when we both stumbled through a green door together. And she became more beautiful, the beat even steadier. My umbrella shielding us from anything that came from above.  Our two transparencies, seemed to be one at times. It was then, that she and I felt like we were being torn. We had come to different doors. She took the one on the left, and I took the one on the right, but we both avoided the black one. I promised I would see her again. That our doors would cross again. She said she would wait for that.
 Blank...
 I was in a line. Behind more men. The leader of the line, made us do odd things. I did not like this man. But I soon grew attached to the people behind and in front of me. My period spent in this room was not pleasent. And everytime I tried to run to one of the doors, I was only left with two options. The black door, or a door of the same make, that I knew would lead me back to this room. So I stayed.
 Blank...
 The leader of the line was motioning for us to move through a door. My transparency became a gun. So did the men in front of me, and in back of me. But the leader of the line's transparency turned into a golden staff. He pushed us foward, and he was no longer the leader. He was behind us.  There were men facing us, and I could sense that these were hate-filled men. And I felt somthing well up inside me. I hated them as well. I saw them not as men, but as animals, savages. And they viewed me as invaders. Mercilessly, I made them take the black door. Some of my friends, the people in the line, also took the black door, until it seemed I was the only one left. 
 I wanted to take the black door myself. To see where it led, to see if it led away from all this savagery. I saw that the men on both sides were men in the same room I was on. And most had passed through the same doors. The second I came to this realization, a new set of doors appeared in front of me. I walked through a purple one, and my transparency, looked like a man...someone familiar...but I couldn't place my hand on it...
 Blank....
 I was happy. I was back with the woman. And together, we built a door ourself. I could suddenly see all the doors, but I didn't want them. This was the room I wanted to stay in.  When we had finished the door, we opened it but did not cross it. And saw happily, that it led to both a light door and a black door. And that someone was making the same descion we all make at the beganning and I felt an attachment to that someone. Me and the woman with the same steady drumbeat, named that someone. And our transparencies turned into glasses, so we could view that someone.  Time sped by. And suddenly the woman's transparency tapped her on the shoulder. And walked her over to the black door. She said goodbye, and I said goodbye. Knowing I would not see her again, till I took the black door. Though I would not take the black door.  
 Blank...
 Time had sped along even faster without the woman. And my transparency turned into a cane. It aided me well, and if I ever passed by someone else, I would tap them with my cane, and I could see it affected them. I even wrote a book. I liked this room, because I could see in every direction, and I passed through many doors. Finally though...I came to the end of one room and saw there was only one door.
 It was black, and I knew it was time to cross it. Though I no longer feared it, nor was I curious. The door seemed almost welcoming. And I turned to my transparency, to bid it fairwell. But my transparency had changed, and it was no longer transparent. It was me. The thing that had always aided me and others was myself. It merged into me, and we took the black door as one.
 Blank...
 Blank...
 ""Pick a door"" a voice whispered. There was a light one and a black one."

"event","If you read any of my journals you do so at your own risk. What I write in here is entirely what I feel, and the truth and it may hurt people. I don't care, I won't censor my thoughts. So if you don't like it, don't read it. This means you Rachel and Renny. 
 Plus, since these are my thoughts as I'm thinking them they might change. So don't hold me to them.

 Ok all! My life is reaching it's breaking point. I'm trying my best to hold it all together, but honestly, I might snap at any time. And it's not a good thing when I snap. Last time I snapped, I scarred a girl for life, stapled my hand, and let my grades slip...
 Well, I'm about to snap. There's been small eruptions everywhere and one semi-huge one. But nothing really big yet. But please, let me list the problems out here.
 
 -My father figure, Charles died in Iraq recently. His death hit me hard.
 -Edward Marks, presumed dead. Was found to be alived, though he is slightly crippled now. He's still been giving advise, but lately it hasn't been as good.
 -I found out a dark family secret or two. My dad is still a compulsive gambler, and is trying to mortage the house to pay off the gambling credits.
-Meaning I could lose my house.
 -I love my dad, and creditors are looking for him. It kinda scares me.
 -I love my mom, but she's being an overbearing Biyatch the last few weeks.
 -My cousin got life in prison. Because he killed a man that was sleeping with his ex-wife. This doesn't bode well for me. I'm making some of the bad descions. And my dad isn't a millionaire.
 -My other uncle who is a bum, has a drinking problem. My grandfather had a gambling problem it's fixed but he had it. My mom has a drinking problem. Almost everyone in my family smokes...what this all adds up to is this simply.
 -I've got a disease in my body. I'm an addict. I haven't been addicted to anything yet. Because I refuse to try anything. But it's not only substances that people are addicited to from my background. They can be hyper-sexual, or love hostile atmospheres.
 -Speaking of hostile atmospheres....I created another one for myself...This one will take a long ass time to explain. SO it'll be at the end of my list of problems.
 -I own three business, that's fucking stressful. Because that income supports me.
 -One of those business's is failing and I don't give a damn. But people keep yelling at me.
 -People keep yelling at me! God, too many deadlines. Too many people hate me. I let too many people down.
 -I'm in three plays at a time...No free time...No dead time.
 -My religion dictates that I fast. Well I can't find a historic base to that. So I fucking gave it up after five days...I just can't take it. But I feel like I'm cheating God, because I know I could do it if I tried. This makes me mad.
 -I'm fucking trying to keep down on my bitch ass swearing...This isn't going so well.
 -I'm treating my body like crap. I'm working out so hard I've fainted.
 -People hate me.
 -People respect and love me and hate to see me fall apart like this.
 -My grades are slipping.
 -I FUCKING HATE MS.LINDSEY-IVERSON! SIGN THE FUCKING FORM AND GET ME THE HELL OUT OF THERE! Jesus H.Christ.
 -There are probally more problems. Problems with other people. But I don't give a damn....Not true, I do give a damn...just I'm so tired.

 I hate letting people down! My dreams are prophetic, and I had a dream I'm going to be a man who changes the world. People are already telling me that now. I'm decalingual, know people in every country, can program in five different languages, spend thousands a day, raised myself, am social, and can make good descions when I'm sane. So I am a good guy at times....
 This makes me so sad. I want to help humanity! I want to make the world a better place! But I'm failing so miserably at little social things. I try to better myself, but each time I reach a new version, I seem to have double the problems. And I refuse to let down humanity! People rely on me even now! For guidance, for hope, for love! I can't turn these people away! I have to be better! I have to overcome these problems for my loved ones, for my family, for everything! I need to be better!
 But how do you get better? You think about a problem, and you solve it. So let me give you the last big problem. And then we'll analyze everything in the next post.

 The Biggie: There are two girls. Rachel Simon, and Renata Stryzcek.  They are like my best friends in the entire world. I think Rachel is sexy, I think she's smart, and I love initiating in conversations with her. I love how aggressive she is, and I love how intense I feel when I'm near her. So I logically asked her out. This is before half of my problems hit me. She told me, simply no. I hate hearing no, because I'm obsessive, and I'm proud. Jessie gave me that. I'm a proud person, and I can't handle rejection well. But for some reason. The fact that she said no....didn't make me feel bad. In fact, I felt exactly the same. Probally because of how cooly she took it.
 Then all these fucking problems hit me. And I looped into depression. I began to feel like I was the worse person on the planet, that I was letting people down, that I was worthless. I mean, people ignore me all the time. So I look at Renata, Rachel's FUCKING BEST FRIEND IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!
 And you know what I fucking do? I fucking go and ask her out! Is it because I love her as more than a friend? No. Is it because I love talking to her? No. I love talking to her, but conversations with her are hella akward because she answers thought provoking questions with O.K. And she has no fucking sympathy. Plus she can't handle sadness, or any intense emotion. That pisses me off sometimes. But she's still one of my best friends and I wouldn't trade her for the world.  I fucking ask her out, because I have a dream. And not one of my normal prophetic dreams, just a normal random dream. And I think she's hot and I think she likes me. 
 And I fucking need a girl right now. Something to idolize, and protect. Someone to be stronger for. Well she rejects me too. And I was not prepared for that. I was sent reeling. It made me feel horrible. Unwanted, dirty. She says no for some obvious and some not so obvious reasons.
 One: I fucking asked out her best friend a week before. So both of them felt used.
 Two: I'm younger than her. And honestly, I always will be. So that's her loss.
 Three: She just doesn't find me attractive.
 Well I half snapped. Because I felt if I could date her. I could become the next version of me. I would be better, and in time I would learn to love her just as much as I love Rachel. Because I do love her as a friend.
 Well she continually rejects me, and I continually ask her out. Finally she snaps, and blocks my phone number, my AIM name and is preparing to excommunicate me.
 Then I realized it. I caught it. I caught myself. I saw how I was acting, I saw my motives as impure. I saw me, and what I was doing!
 This is a big deal folks, I NEVER, catch myself when I'm being an ass. I catch it after the damage has been done. I catch it when there is no chance to make things better. But I caught myself. I saw I was being A FREAKY STALKER, A CREEPY BASTARD TO ONE OF MY FUCKING BEST FRIENDS! Folks, can you say breakthrough? I caught it. I fixed that problem. It should have never happened, but it did and I caught myself.
 So her brother calls me and tells me to lay off her sister. And instead of picking a fight which he obviously expected. I apologize my ass of. Say I know where's he's coming from, and that I was out of line. I ask if I can speak to Renata, but I secretly think she's going to refuse. That I was too late, that the damage was irrepairable. That I was done and I would have to move on.
 But he obviously wasn't expecting my rebuttal, and so shocked. Awe-struck, hands the phone to his sister. Who I'm surprised talks to me still.
 So I spill my guts out to her. Tell her I'm so sorry. But you know the best way to say you're sorry folks? To never fucking do it again. To be good enough so that you don't relapse. She sees how much stress I have, and she forgives me. There is still a bit of resentment, but not much, and that little bit can only be moved in time. So...fixing that problem. I have to move onto the other one.
 Rachel. Oh my god Rachel. The girl of my dreams. The one some people for some god damned reason don't give a second look.  I realize if I'd been horrible to anyone, it was defintlely her. I can't believe how she must have felt. Because I had lied when talking to Renata, saying I had never really wanted Rachel. Oh hell yes. Rachel is a goddess, and I love spending time with her. I just think she's the best. So  I talk to Rachel and she forgives me. Honestly, I love these two. They forgive me!
 And what's better! They've always thought I was a great person! Me a great guy. Me....someone a junior can respect! As the song in one of the musicals I'm doing says. 
""If just one person believes in you, deep enough and strong enough believes in you. Hard enough and long enough, before you know it, maybe even you can start to see what others see in you too..."" 
 Those two believe in me. They know my stress, and they say they're not giving up on me. No matter what happens. They're not going to hate me. They'll get mad. But they're not going to give up! I think I may overcome this problem I have with people...If I have their help. 
 So apologies were said and done. And I go to bed...almost smiling...but one more problem is nagging at me.
 Well school comes...today I mean. And they always, this was before fighting. Are together, and talk to each other WAY more than they even seem to breathe near me. At school they're Rachata Strymon, and Spencer is just a third wheel. I'm cool with that, but just once, I'd love to have them wait up for me. Or notice that I'm there. That's I'm part of the group. 
 Let me launch into a sub rant here. Warning Sub rant....Skip over if you don't want to be distracted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I don't fucking belong into a social group. I thought me and the drama kids hit it off well. But then I felt like I needed to shrink back, cause of Steph and other reasons. Then they think I love one of their group. And that's a crazy lie. I never had a crush on Sarah, I was dating another Sarah at the time. *Laughs* But anyways, while it's not like we hate each other. They just don't invite me to do stuff...and so I just feel on the outside.
 I don't fit in with the Puyallup kids. They love me. But transportation is way too hard.
 I don't fit in with Luke's friends. I love Luke, Meleah, and off and on Vance/Johnny/Garret/all of them. But they just don't invite me. As I'm the last group member. At least they respect me though. They never seem to respect Vance.
 I don't fit in with C8worlders...as this is embaressing...but I'm just not smart enough. The brightest minds in the world. I'm not one of them. 
 I don't fit in with my groupies. As I don't like gay love, and I don't do drugs. 
 I don't fit in with fucking any ONE group. And while I get tons of tiny perks for being apart of a thousand small groups. The fact that I don't stick with one, prevents me from becoming very close and internal. I think subconciously, I do that to myself.  
Maybe I should focus more on what's right than what's wrong...but that's another topic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sub rant over. Ok so anyways.  I go to school today. They make me feel disincluded. But they're leaving for Ellensburg tommorow, and so I'll be free to chill with people I never get to talk to, cause I follow them constantly. I hate being clingy, but I am. Anyhoo, at lunch, instead of clinging to them. I go hang out with my groupies, then go and have a quick walk around the school with Chops...*Jacob..another rant, bout the name.* Well...I run into them, and so I follow them with Jacob. Well, they once again....well they don't blow me off. But I just don't feel included. I smile and stuff. And they don't even say bye to me when I leave the Ochrestra room. I'm kinda feeling bad. But then again, I made them feel bad for an entire week. So some payback is in order. But we forgave each other, so things should be cool...right?
 Well if I listen to fucking Kevin Peterson or Jessica Fitzgerald in Science, then it's fucking not. They say that Rachel and Renata were saying things that weren't flattering about my charachter. And I wig out. And pressure them, wanting to know more. They both won't give. But Kevin mentioned a website where I offered $375 for whoever got one of them to date me. Ok, that's fucking messed up right there.
 I may stalkerish in nature, but I'm not a stalker. I made no such website. Nor did I post an offer of money.  I know why Renata would think that. Back when I was being a jackass, I mentioned in an email an offer of $300 to whoever the hell got me out of this mess.
 So I get mad. And I pressure Jessie and Kevin and Jessie threw this...Tells me something very, very important. ""Spencer...you can fix this. Don't have other solve your problems. Do it yourself."" I'm stunned. I was making others do my dirty work. Damn...Something to fix. But she's right. I could fix it. I just need to talk to them.
 So I run and catch them afterschool. I guess it was just a big misunderstanding. They say they said no such things, and that there was no lasting conflict. The sincerity of their voices, the sincerity of the confusion, I never doubted for a second that they were telling the truth.
 It made me feel good. And I didn't call or talk to them tonight. I'm going to just cool down and reevaluate who I am. I'm a better man than I was when I was with Steph. Stephanie made me better, but I still have some of the same problems. I made me better. I am a better man, and I caught myself.
 But I still have things to work on. And I need to be able to patch them up when R and R get back. And I do mean patch them. I can't fix major faults, even if I have idenified them in two days. But I can patch them up enough so that I won't explode. So many bandages.
 Now one more bit, till I make the good news, recovery plan information.
 I'm screwed over. Royally screwed. Because I still have a giant crush on Rachel and I can't even tell my best friends. I could tell Sam...but he wouldn't understand. I could tell Edward, but he'd tell me a way to fix it. A way that wasn't mine..... I can't tell Renata for obvious reasons! Nor can I tell her!
 And it's not like I can ask her out again! She'll say no! She doesn't find me attractive...I just wish...No...no wishing! I'll wait as long as I need too. I'll build my skills, I'll stop being so pitful. I'm going to fully transform myself into a man for her. This is my new goal. My new setting. My truth mission. I will do what I set out to do for once, instead of changing my sights at the last second.
 I did the same thing a year ago, and I got Steph. Now Steph was great, but she wasn't what I really wanted. And so the relationship was doomed from the start. Yes....Now onto the next post and happy things... Yay! ^_^ Without Wax,
Spencer Jerome"

"event","I slept in today. I don't normally sleep in. I slept in till 11:00, woke up. And I cleaned for a large portion of the day. I felt really sad for some reason. Then I realized it was because Rachel said she couldn't do something with me today.
 
 Oh God! My God, what shall I do? I think I love Rachel....I can't love her, she's older than me...but...no. I love everyone, which is getting to be big pain in the arse....I wish I was gay.

 Then I talked to Angela who said someone was on my old AIM account yesterday, and was flaming people. You see Angela is a good friend of mine, who has a crush on me as well. I'd go out with her...but Puyallup is so far away, and sometimes I doubt she's ready for a real relationship. Besides, she broke up with a good friend of mine for me. So it's akward. But anyhoo, this person bitched out a whole bunch of people under my name. Which angers me. So I had to change my password. Grrr...

 Then Bryan Hemming comes over, and asks if he can come in. He does, but then I realize he has three other people with him. They say they're going over to Keejan's to play Halo, and want me to come with. Well, as it turns out, we stay at my house and invite Keegan over and play Halo. With six people. Ahh...pure killing fun. This David guy...he almost beat me though...I'll have to start playing Halo again, and not do it the show offy way. Mad props to him.
 Well, I have to do yard work so I kick them out. When I call Rachel and she decides she'll take some time out of her all too busy schedule to play LQ with me. It's her first time, and it's great because......

 WE WERE THE ONLY TWO BLEEPING PEOPLE THERE!

 So we had a marshall play with us. It was actually pretty neat, I thought it was lame, cause I won by over a thousand points. But Rachel had fun, and that's all that really mattered.

 I spent the rest of the day, writing in my journal, and posting on Warhammer Online. Mmm...a marvelous weekend. Time to stay up and do homework now."

"event","Me and Luke arrive at this party, and our one of the first people here. Of course Steph and her friends arrived earlier, but meh. Being near Steph always makes me kind of uncomfy, I think she still thinks I have a crush on her. So I try to avoid eye contact as much as possible.
 Well the night goes on, and me and Luke talk about him and Meleah and their break-up. The break-up makes me incredibly sad, as I always saw it as a sign of hope that I could one day have a loving relationship like that. Well, we're in the middle of the conversation, when a shape runs out from behind a T.V., then from behind a lamp.

 Meet Charles, or as I called him Alfred. I extend my hand, to shake it and I say ""Hi, my name is Spencer..what's up bud.."" The exact reply. ""Heh heh. I'm hiding. I'm Charles, and I'm anti-social"" *Insert his creepy laugh here.* When asked why he was hiding, he explains he hates these Bah Hai functions, and only goes because of his gf. Me and Luke start talking to him, and we get into an argument because he's wearing a symbol of satan on his t-shirt. He keeps arguing himself into a corner, using circular logic, and just downright being stupid.  If it was the old me, I would have argued till my lips fell off. But the new me, found another solution. ""You know what, you're right."" Telling him that he was right, made him run off. 
 
 When I talked to him later, explaining that I didn't hate him, and had had a slightly stressful day. I actually kinda liked the quirky little guy's charm.
 
 And that's when I saw her, the woman in red, sitting down. Now I didn't know her name, how old she was, or even see her face. I just saw her figure, and her wonderful hair. I was physically attracted, something I am not usually. As the bible says ""And there shall be a woman in red..."" Being the timid person I am, I can't even go out and ask her anything. Luke eventually pulls me away, saying she looks downright homely, and we leave to find Josh.
 
 Josh Ryklin is a fellow Bah Hai, and an all around cool guy. He should be a Columbian druglord when he grows up, because of how laid back and gangsta cool she is. This is where the druggie comes in. Apparently this guy is a good friend of Josh's and when Josh realizes that there is barely any food at this place, he decides we're walking to Mcdonald's...
 
 Well this druggie guy, *Who says, he's clean now..yah right.* offers us a ride. Luke accepts, and it's my obligation to come with. We go, we eat, we talk about Meleah and Luke somemore, and we take home some black guy and his girlfriend because the druggie knew them...This druggie drives at insane speeds, and I find myself reciting prayers because I'm afraid he'll kill us all.
 Turns out, when we get back and start playing a game of Monopoly, that this guy used to date Stephanie's older sister. And he talks about how while he never had sex with her, he used to love playing with her boobs. Visibly disgusted, I got up and left. And I bumped into her, the woman in red. Her name is Mikka, and we learned how to do some sort of dance together.
 We began talking, and boy do we have a lot in common, and she was so beautiful. Well, eventually in the middle of a dance, she asks me the question I'd been dreading.....""How old are you?"" Now I'm sweating bullets...we'd been having so much fun. If I answered truthfully, I may be too young for her, so I did something I hate doing, and had been clean of doing for two months....I lied. ""I'm 18"" I said. Turns out she's 21. We talk about colleges, and stuff. Thank God Chelsea and Adrian tell me all about college stuff.
 Eventually she says, ""It's getting hot in here, let's go outside."" And she pulls me out by my hand. While we're going out, I see Luke and he sees me grinning, and he gives me a thumbs up. God Bless Luke.
  Well, me and Mikka begin to kiss. I've never, ever, EVER! Kissed a woman I barely knew. Especially someone I'm not in a relationship with. And it scared me out of my mind, and yet it was strangely enjoyable, the thrill. We went back inside, and I asked her for her number and stuff. Which I got grinning, she left. And that's when I ran into the zealot.
 His name is Ramatala, and he has a Fro the size of a small dog. He was awesome! We talked about religion for an hour, an entire hour! He respected me as an equal, and we talked about the movie ""The Passion of Christ"" And then I noticed something...Luke and Josh were gone. That was bad news...with a captial B.
 You see, when normal people get depressed, they cry, or sulk, or get angry. Luke looks for trouble. And I had a feeling he'd been in the Church looking for it. So I run upstairs, and sure enough I see a shadow dart behind the altar, but then the shadow flies out again back into the dark.
 I'm scared out of my ever-loving mind. This Church is freaky enough, without a mysterious shape running around. ""Luke"" I croak out. And jump about ten feet in the air when I hear. ""I'm not Luke, heh heh!"" It was Charles. Who was apparently hiding from his gf. We talked for a bit, and I got some insight into who the guy is. Like I said, not a bad guy, just religiously confused.
 I go downstairs, still searching for Luke, when Josh's mom tells me their in the car, ready to go. I nod, smile, and go to get my book. *Stephanie had given me a book earlier in the party. God Bless Steph, I really needed that book* So I go to grab it, because I had placed it in a bag, and I hear.
 ""I was reading that. *SIGH*"" And I once again, jump out of my skin. It's Pearl, Charle's girfriend. This girl is so depressed, it wasn't even funny. Apparently she and Charles got in a fight. So....I did it. I did what I always do. You know I've met some people who can not say it...but I always do.
 ""What's wrong?"" I ask.
 *SIGH SIGH SIGH SIGH SIGH CHARLES SIGH SIGH SIGH WIN SIGH SIGH* Is the equivelent of the conversation. I talk to her for a long time, and finally help her and Charles out. I really hope the two of them are going to be O.K. together. I eventually got her to smile and then I left.

 Apparently, Josh has decided he's going to spend the night with me and Luke. Which is cool. SO we get home play some Halo, but then I tell them. ""I need to get to sleep guys, I have to teach a workshop tommorow."" They nod, and then they put the phone to my mouth, telling me they're calling Meleah. You see, Meleah trusts me. So I have to talk to her, and I just say hi. Keep in mind it's midnight....Grr..dumb peoples!
 So I get to sleep, wondering why they did that, when they wake me up at 3:00 in the morning and say. ""We're going to Meleah's wanna come with?"" I groan no, and go to sleep. They leave, and apparently piss her off more. Luke reminds me of me, and my break up with Steph. I guess all guys do crazy things after break ups...
 
 Well, it's 9:00 and I got to be at the school at 9:30 when I wake up. So I have Luke call Renata about Sunday, and I rush out the door to drive and go to Stadium. *As long as I'm careful, and promise not to get caught, my parents occasionaly let me drive the car, I do have a permit* I get there, and no one is there. Cept Erik, Max, and Rashawn and Willhoft.
 It was cool though, cause we just talked for like 6 hours, and then left. I feel really close to all of them now.
 
 Well I get home, and I call Meleah, about their break up. We talk for a long time, and I finally find the root of her problems, and I get her and Luke back together. I should really be a relationship counselor. Able to solve everyone's romantic problems but my own. I wish a girl out there loved me, that I loved back. That I felt a relationship was possible with.
 See a lot of girls have a crush on me, I just don't have one back, or see it working. This includes Renata....but not Rachel. Rachel is cool like Amber.

  Anyhoo, my dad then takes me to Laser Quest, and I actually beat him by 30 points. It was the first time I've ever beat my dad. And I was really, happy cause we all had a great time. Till Paul*My little bro* Gets upset, cause kids were mean to him in the maze. Well kids call me names all the time in the maze, like ""Hopkins, Wierdo, Dancer, Freak..."" And they say it, cause my technique is wierd, but they respect me cause I kick their ass.
 The same is true with my little bro, but he doesn't get, that they give him a nickname cause they're scared. So my dad, yells at him for crying. And yells at him all the way home, about him being depressed and like my mom. So eventually I have to stop the insanity and yell at him for yelling at a 9-year old that has no father figure.
 He immediatly apologizes to Paul, and hugs him and cries. It's a rare day indeed my dad cries. He was so sorry for yelling at Paul. He takes us home, and I stay in the car. And I hug him, and kiss him on the cheek. I tell him ""I love you dad, and you didn't ruin the day for us. We had a lot of fun, it's just there is a lot of stress on everyone these days, since the seperation. God bless you daddy."" He cries again, but it's happy tears, and he drives away.
 Then I head over to Keejan's party, and kick some ass at Halo. Oh god, I love Halo. It relieves agression as well. 
 Part 3, and the final part of my weekend. Today, Sunday, is in the next post."

"event","Friday was one of the wierdest days of my life. I woke up at 4:30, said an obligatory prayer, and realized I still had a lot of time left till school. Normally I watch VH1 and eat breakfast, and do homework I didn't do.... But Friday, for some reason, I checked my old email, hoping to see Kevin emailing me. He didn't, but then I saw Steph's ""private"" conffession. And I was like blown away. So maybe that's why the day seemed so wierd, cause I was shellshocked.
 Well I head off to school, and I sit by Amber, we used to sit together a lot, but then Lindsay came, and I sat next to her more. So yes..that was strange. I love talking to Amber, I feel like I can tell her anything. She's so cool, though she can't keep secrets well. She's the only person I told about Steph forgiving me. I feel it's a private thing, isn't it Journal? That is between me and her.
 Anyhoo, I get to school, and Lindsey-Iverson, my math teacher is back. Something you need to know is....I used to hate her. Hate her with a passion. Something about her just makes me mad, and apparently everyone else in the world too. Today, I saw that. That she is just a teacher, someone trying to do her best, and me making smart assed comments, doesn't help her. I figured out I should just be kind. So I was, and I learned for the first time, because I gave her a chance.
 Wouldn't that be great, if everyone in the world, just closed their eyes for a second on a person they hated, and saw them as a person. Just like everyone else, and gave them another chance?

 Well, then I go off to 2nd period, and take a test that was designed to cause stress. Then we go off for a walk, come back, and the stress is relieved. Unfortuantly, I figured out the point of the exercise when we began the walk, and so was still stressed....^_^

 Third period ensues, and we learn more about the Greek's. And I see a clip from Brother Where Art Thou? I so need to see that movie. I love the music the ""Sirens"" sing. ""You and me and the Devil makes three..."" Mmm mmm goodness. That and the fact I got to sit behind Melissa Mcdoogle, for some reason I find her ridiculously attractive.

 Fourth period, and they tell me I get first lunch today, because 2nd lunch, I'll be helping set up for the Assembly.
 So I go down, buy lunch, and go back upstairs. I try and sit with the drama buffs, but I just don't fit in with them. I actually think they don't like me. I mean, who would like a creepy kid who just hangs on the sidelines and doesn't talk? *sighs* Wouldn't it be great if life had a rewind button?  I'd have said something outrageously witty, and they would have loved me forever...or at least that's the hope.

 But then I met Lindsay, she follows me because she sits alone at lunch, and I introduce her to Luke and his friends. Which by the way Luke and Meleah broke up. But I didn't learn that till later that day.
 Fifth period I just learned writing relieves stress. But fifth was earlier in the day, damned bell schedule.
 Helping set up for the assembly pissed me off. I'm stronger than half of ASB and so I get made a pack mule. I think I earned the respect of my fellow council men when I lifted something up by myself that four other people couldn't. But most of the people on ASB are corrupt jerks who don't give a damn about the people, and I really don't care if they respect me or not. So since I was pissed at being a packmule I went upstairs into the library to grab a table. *I could have just went to the office* And I snap at Rachel and Renata who tell me they might not be able to make it this Sunday to LQ, I say in a nasty tone, that ""It's alright."" Nasty tones are about as mean as I get these days, but it still makes me mad when I do lose my cool.
 But then strange people, who I'd helped in the past, help me lift the table down. It was cool.
 
 I don't remember rehearsal, but I remember meeting a girl I hadn't met since the beganing of the school year, and some of the  ""Pit"" people, telling me they want to see me naked. They were smoking though, so I think their opnions were less than pure, though it was funny when they told Amber, about their ambition to see me naked. I also remember driving home with Sarah and Ryan Wilson yelling about ""THE THIVILIZER...oooh yah!""

 Getting home at 5:30, I just want to kick off my shoes and relax. When who should appear at my door, then Luke Alger, telling me that I invited him to a party that night. I had totally forgotten about it, and so had to beg my mom for a ride. She gives it to me, and we get to the party. And that's when things get wierd....Part Two of my wierd day begins in the next post."

 Woah, haven't seen you in a long time journal. It's been a very, very long time. But I'm back, I feel it's important to record my thoughts and feelings somewhere. I found in the last weekend writing down how I feel once in awhile, helps more than four hours of meditation...

 And before I say more! I JUST SAW A PREVIEW OF DAWN OF THE DEAD ON T.V.! Happiness is mine! I love zombie horror flicks, though it kinda bums me in this one they can run. Oh well, you win some you lose some! ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the Earth.""-Dawn of the Dead.
 
 You may be asking Journal...Why the hell am I back? Well to be honest, I forgot this thing even existed. I've changed my screename on AIM, my email, and I normally visit Warhammer Online and Realms of Illusia more than c8world now. So why am I back?
 Well, I'm back because I checked my email! *Laughs* You know how I have that option, that whenever anyone posts to my journal, it emails me? Well I checked my old email, cause a friend said he emailed me. Well he never did, but I found out that Stephanie posted here.
 She posted that she thinks I'm a good person! Journal, do you know how long I've been waiting for her to think I am a good person? That I've changed?
 I've spent a year, an entire year journey, trying to be a better man. Trying to be better, stronger, faster, for her. And she tells me she thinks I'm a good person. Journal, nothing makes my heart feel lighter than that. This means...no one hates me anymore. Maybe I can actually begin to think more highly of myself. 

 But Journal, let's not get confused, in my last entry, you see that I still had a crush on Steph, and went on a mission to win her back. Boy have my priorities changed.

 The biggest change was, I rediscovered religion. I've always been a believer in God, but I've never found a religion that voiced all my opnions...with Steph I discovered the Bah Hai's but I never really had an interest in joining. Till I did some more reading. I fell in love with it. I'm now ready to dedicate myself to this new faith. I hope I don't scare Steph though...*Sighs*
 
 But another great change is, I met Rachel and Renata, Journal you'll hear me reffering back these two a lot. They're my two best friends. We don't remember how we met, but we hit it off splendidly. And constantly do things together. It makes me feel slightly better about not fitting in with the drama buffs. They taught me that the mistakes I made in the past, are in the past, and as long as I learn from them, I shouldn't mourn them. And I'm going to do that.

 My parents also officially split, but meh, that's not a big deal to me. Just worries me about my little brother. 
 
 So Journal, what you see is a new man. I'm prone to mistakes still...but I can overcome them."

"event","""I am the alpha of your omega, the beginning of your end.""-Agent Smith. ""Enter the Matrix.""
 Today I bought the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack for $15.00, a great price for a great cd. I also beat the Enter the Matrix with both charachters and so got a really neat Even Essence song. That was just the beginning of a good morning.
 Then me and my grandfather left to go look for costume stuff. I found the shirt I needed, but will need to keep looking for the other shirt, and the ugly stuff.
 The Sam came over, we went to the mall. Had fun till Theresa told me to get out of her store. *Laughs* But she's a nice lady and didn't mean it. We just fight in good fun. I wonder if that's right or wrong? When I'm 16, she says she'll hire me for a job at her bookstore. That would be cool.
 So then we went to Red Robin had a burger, bought the cd, and went home.
 Where Sam found some fireworks I had left behind. He lit off the bottle rockets. Which is okay....except he did it right near the golf course and had them pointed that way. Though on the plus side I got a lighter. Never trusted the things before, fire is a source of wonder to me, but in some small way like every man, I fear it.  Sam left shortly after that to get away. Like I said. Sam=fireworks=bad.
 I've learned another lesson today. Luke called me up. Asking me to not say anything bad about him and Meleah. *Apparently Vance had been making up rumours they were having sex while we were there* I told him it was cool and I wouldn't say anything cause nothing happened. Then thanked him for letting me go with him to the movies.
 He said it was cool, and he said we should do stuff like that more often. Then saying, he asked about my pilgramiges. True enough, I do intend to leave in the summer. But not before, I intended to cut him off too and changed my mind.
 He asked me why. I said because I wasn't good enough for the people I was with. That I should be better. He explained to me that I am good enough for anyone, and that if someone says differently I should say screw 'em. And if I don't think I'm good enough for someone,  I should be nice to the person and rethink  why I think I'm not good enough for them.
 So I guess the lesson is this. That in order for me to be a better person, I gotta know I am. I can't go thinking I'm horrible, because obviously a lot of people like Luke and Sam don't think I am. So no more ragging on myself. 
 So two lessons down. At this rate, I'll be a new me, ready to go searching for Stephanie's heart in no time!
 But I'm going to stop reffering to this search as the search for the ""new"" me. Because I was a good person. I am a good person. But I've lost sight of myself. So this is more of a quest to find out who I was. Because obviously I can be a great guy, I just usually choose not too. Well goodnight journal. Tommorow is a school day, and thus my self inflicted exile will really begin. And quite a task it will be to remain in confiment. Without talking. A maddening task, but I must do it. Must feel what it's like. In order to be better for it. 
 From now on when I learn a life lesson. One that will get me closer to my ultimate goal of self-enlightment. I will post a star next to the topic."

"event","""I'm a new man, Mr.Anderson.""-Agent Smith, Matrix Reloaded.
 *Blows the dust off journal* Hello one and all I'm back. Kicking and screaming and crying. I'm back. Back to writing about my life, because documentation is important. I usually repeat my mistakes, I figure if I write them down, maybe I won't.
  But as the above quote states, I am a new man. Completly changed from my last entry. Allow me to fill in the blanks.
 Point 1: This is probally the defining change. I now have an ex-girlfriend. Stephanie broke up with me about two months ago. At first it spiraled me into depression beyond comprehension. But once again, like the pheonix I rose from the ashes. To half of my former self. I'm still madly in love with her. But she will never love me back. A fact that I must understand and keep in me.
 Sure I've tried dating around, but it's just not the same. I don't fill fullfilled on the inside. She gave me something, then took it away. Or I guess you could say I took it away.
 I wasn't the greatest boyfriend. Simply put. I'd do tons of tiny things that got on her nerves. I acted macho, and quite honestly hurt people in front of her in the hope of impressing her. I was way too stressed out so leaned very heavily on her, and really, really smothered her. I obsess it is, no, was my nature. I drove her away. Didn't deserve her.  No, don't deserve her.
 I don't deserve a lot of what I have. My friends might disagree but it's true. I lie on a regular basis. About everything and anything. Trying to look better than I really am. Trying to be someone else. But that got me to thinking. What does image matter anyway? Then I took it to mean what defines you, and who you are. How others, the people who interact with you daily treat you and shape you.
 This also got me to thinking, who am I? Who am I? Anytime I get asked that question I utterly freeze.
 Okay, I'm Spencer Aaroan Jerome. White, male. 6'0, 170 pounds. Alright, so far so good....But I don't know what I like. I know when I'm happy, I know some things that give me the general hit. But I can't really define them. I can't act *Almost* the same everyday. Happy then depresed, then whatever the heck is next.
 So I decided. It's time to change that. Time to change me. Starting yesterday, I've given up my old life. Left all my communities, disconnected myself from almost all my friends, let go of Stephanie and my search for her heart again. It's all gone. *Throws out window* Leaving me with nothing but a fresh start. A new chance. A new me. Well, I suppose the original me since I don't know who me is! And when I've made it good enough for me. When I become a good enough man. After my travels. Then I will come back to reclaim the good things of the old me. My friends, my items, my family-life. And maybe when I come back. I'll deserve her love. Be a good enough man. A man at all. Someone she can rely on to be steady and true. Totally self-confident and even self-reliant. Come back to her because I love her, not because I need her. So I've been learning lessons.
  First things first in the new life. While I did ask a lot of my friends to leave me alone, because of my quest for a new me. A better me for them. I did keep some friends. Friends who are darker than me, but understand some of me better than anyone else. New friends. Luke is more than a bit like me. Multi-personality, a bit off it, cynical, but the difference between the two of us, is our beliefs. I believe what I believe and he believes what he believes and God help me if the beliefs ever have to cross.
 Keeping him and his friends.
  And I'm keeping my theatre/dance/improve friends. As I need to work with them consistantly and they also bring out a part of me I like. A really nice part that I'd like to keep. My imaginative side. Heather even told me this pilgramige idea is a good one and Heather is usually right.

 Well, anyway. I'm doing a new play now ""Honk"" and have quite extensive parts in it.
 I joined a Improv group called ""The Tokens"" Great guys, and another thing to add to my portfolio.
 Joined another swing troupe. One that requires no partner.
 And Luke invited me to go to the movies last night.
With him and his friends.
 Now to you, this may not seem like a big deal. To me, this meant the world. Normally, Luke is real embaressed of me. He never lets me hang out around his friends, because I upset 'em, he never let's me meet his friends from Renton, cause he fears I'd upset 'em too. But he sensed the change in me. The depressed kind. And figured I wouldn't upset anyone.
 Well, needless to say I didn't! I know! I didn't upset a single person. Sure I didn't contribute all that much and make the experience more enjoyable. I also met, Vance. A kid who was a bit scared of suicidal me, and I didn't have a real high opnion of him. Well, we got to talking on the way to the movie. HE ROCKS! Seriously, we hit it off really well together. Talking throughout the entire movie and probally ruining the experience for those behind us. *If you're reading this. I'm SO sorry. Didn't see you there.*
 We have a lot of the same tastes and everything. We're going to change contact information this Monday. We also are the two sanest people of the group.
 The group is Garret,Luke,Richie, Meleah, Vance, Tyler, and Craig. And now me/Andy/Josh are all on and off. We we're the Tacoma group.
 Luke has friends in Renton. Really, strange friends from Renton. One of which is name is Spencer. So Garret decided to call me Captain El Gato. Which means Captain Cat. I liked that and it made things way less confusing. So I got a nickname.
 We went into the theatre. To see the ""Matrix Reloaded"" making it the third time I've seen the movie. Needless to say I'm very lucky Vance had already seen it too. Hence our conversations. Craig and the Renton kids almost got us kicked out of the theatre which is why it's fortuante me and Vance came a little later than everyone else and so had to sit in another aisle.
 After the movie Craig pissed in a popcorn bucket, and threw it on a phone. After some heated running, we got to the van and Luke's mom punched it. Luke's mom is either oblivious, cool, or really, really crazy. More of that later.
 Well we get home after dropping everyone off. Except for me,Vance,Meleah and of course Luke. Now I told my parents I'd be home by 9:15. When we got home it was 11:30! Vance told his parents the same thing. And I swear he was close to tears. Well, since he was so afraid I figure I should be. He called his house first.
 His dad yelled at him for like ten minutes loud enough for me to hear bits and pieces. It wasn't pretty and then the dad, thinking yelling at Vance wasn't enough, decided to yell at Luke's mom. That was unnerving. Well, eventually they decided he would spend the night there and go home early in the morning. 
 Then it was my turn. Palms sweaty, throat scratchy, I called. My mom answered on the first ring or so. Told her it was 11:30, sorry for not coming home and asked if I could spend the night. I could almost hear her shrugging. She honestly didn't care at all. That blew my mind, but then again sometimes they are like that.
  Then Meleah called her dad. Left a message. And this also blew my mind. Went to spend the night. Since it blew my mind it shows me how society driven I am. Luke's mom was okay with it. Which blew Vance and Luke and Meleah away. Meleah's dad did call back and I couldn't hear his reaction but she could spend the night. So *Shrugs*
 We played Halo for all of ten minutes before Vance decided to call it quits and said he needed to get to bed to prepare for the morning yelling. I volunteered to sleep on the floor. Not wanting to intrude. But Vance didn't want to sleep on the top bunk, nor did he want to sleep on the floor. So they told me to sleep on the top bunk, which I was cool with. Except it meant Meleah and Luke had to sleep on the ground. I don't know where you come from, but that didn't sit well with me. A lady should never sleep on the floor if other options are avaible. And the host shouldn't either! Yet both of them did. Which is good because of course they wanted to sleep together. *Not that way you sick monkey you!*
 And that's where I learned my first lesson, my first lesson on the road to finding me. ""What love is."" When I saw Luke and Meleah together I nearly cried at how beatiful it was. I never said anything when they of course. *Ahem* showed their love. But I saw what love was. The link between them was amazing. It was at this weak point, what me and Stephanie had at our highest point. Their weak was my high. Meleah even found me to be a cool guy and I found her to be a great gal. She told me I wasn't ugly, but when it comes to girls I need to be a little less smothering and watch my money a bit more.
 So when Vance left early. I took Luke aside and asked him if it was okay if I stayed around a bit. He nodded and it was great. Played games and just talked till about 1:00 when I left home. And found out in order to be a new man. I gotta look it. Some kids mistook me for someone else and I liked that. New look, I'm going for clean-shaven, and I'll have Meleah pick the hair, and clothing style the new me should have. Should also wear contacts more.
 So all in all. I'm off to a great start. First lesson learned. One day, Stephanie. I promise you. I'll be back and I'll show you that love that Luke showed Meleah. That kind of attachement. That warmth. I promise that. 
 *Sighs* But she's going to need to want me back first. And who knows how that will work. Maybe it won't. Well when I'm completly better, completly found. Then I'll know. Till then I'm signing off."

"event","Hello hello. I'm pretty irked as I posted something pretty big and detailed and I forgot my password isn't what I thought it was. *Sighs* 
 I've been busy lately so sorry for not updating *For those of you who come from c8world I will now post a last updated thing so you can know when I update it* But that's because I'm busy. And when I'm busy I'm happy. I love learning new skills so that's probally why I'm happy being busy with theatre. And doing menial tasks make it so I can't think which is why I like P.E. 
 Speaking of the theatre. Opening night is in five more days and I'm more than just a little nervous. Sure I've had lead parts before but those were in school or during plays where they would only show three times. Now I'm in a play where they're going on 16 performances. That's alot. And I've yet to do a single run through without messing up at least one thing. But Lisa *My best friend at the theatre and coincidentally the lead charachter in our latest play* says I'm getting better every time I run through it. So maybe I'll be ok. Gotta be good because my girlfriend is going to be there and I really want to impress her. 
 *Sighing* Well I got accepted into the best school in all of Washington *Or so I'm told* Belleramine. Why am I sighing? Because I can't go. Because my parent's finicial situation is pretty rocky and Belleramine is uber expensive.  Now how is it supposed to be a Christian school yet make it so only the rich can go? That is the most stupid thing ever. I hate how our society is ran by greed and by the ""The guy who came first policy"" I think you know what I'm talking about. The guy who comes first gets the best stuff and so all his family gets to join in. So if that guy comes first everyone in his family tree gets it before you do. So people with siblings at Bellermine not only get more finicial aid but also are guarnteed in. GARGH!
 Then we get to greed. Our society is completly driven by money. What possesions you have, what education you can afford. It's so stupid. Now I can understand why the concept of money was invented but why have so much emphasis. Luckily being the genius I am I've thought of a solution. Now why can't we run on house credits and food credits? You get the credits to pay for the two essentials of life by doing any of the jobs people do now. And almost all jobs pay the same. Except for ones no one would do without incentive like police, janitor etc. Or those jobs are done by kids for early jobs. Now sure there are some drawbacks to this system. And greed would still exist but it would be greatly reduced. When I take over the world I'll have perfected the system and will get back to you.
 I thought I'd just run a little section here on Steph. She's really been on my mind alot lately. And I mean it's pretty serious up in my head. She's everything I would have ever wanted in a girl. She's very intelligent, she's one of the most beatiful creatures on God's green earth, religious and is very strong where I'm weak. The reason I'm thinking of her is yesterday my friend got hold of a porno film *We're such children* And was like having people over to errm... share the spoils of his success. But you know what? I didn't go. Not because I worried about getting caught. Or because I thought it was morally wrong. I did it because I was thinking of Stephanie. So I skipped that thing and I'm damned proud of it. All for her. 
 Speaking of for her. That's the great thing about not being able to pay for Bellermine I'm going to Decatur. The same school she is. Of course I had to be inventive in how I was going about going to a out of district school I did it. So instead of having a year without us being together. I'm going to have yet another year with her. They say love at first sight is impossible, that the odds of getting a girlfriend at 14 and keeping them for life is impossible. But I've always been the exception and even if it does end. I'll always remember the time I did spend with her. And remember I was my best for her, that I did nothing wrong. That I resisted temptation and came out the experience a better man than I've ever been just because I met her. Always remember the emotions and experiences that come from a relationship and truly I think relationships our how God judges people. Oh Simpsons are on.. Peace out!"

Hopefully my c8world friends will love her as much as I do. *By the way. Notice the four month gap between when I quit and my last entry. I'm back*  So yes. She's had people leave her for other girls. And Chelsea left me for another guy. That makes us perfect for each other. Us, both being second string and all. *L*
 The RolePlay on Warhammer Online is going great as I get to be the bad guy in it. Setting up tons of nasty traps for my friends. *L* I am of course the skaven*Skaven are rat-men* So that's why I get to set traps. But I'm also the loveable headmage and they're hell bent on rescuing me. So I get to write a interesting combination of hostage and evil genius. Skaven are fun to write as they are so cowardly. Yah that's going great.
 Now, onto Morrowind! My friend spent the night last night. And I kinda blew him off for this game. It's so awsome. I found some armour that makes me so buff. And it only weighs like 10 pounds. Unfortuantly I'm miles away from any town... But oh well.
 Finally, the theatre. I saw my play ""Big Bob Kelly"" the other day. And I have to say I hate myself. I am not a good Texan in it. BUt now I can be a good Texan. If only I had a time machine.

 Anyhoo I saw XXX today the plot was pretty flimsy at parts but the special effects and stunts were to die for, and of course seeing a movie with Chelsea makes it much,much better! Signs finally made sense to me after talking to a few people so it's 3.5/5 now. 

 Now as for why I'm a jerk. You see it's funny how c8 makes me so horrid at times. I had a pretty sweet spot on it once actually twice but then I screwed it up 4 FREAKING TIMES! Hehehe I guess I am doomed to repetive behavior. So my very good friend Jacob goes and get's a nice job I don't congradulate him I be a jerk and become jealous. I guess every human does feel jealous but doesn't act on it to me it's like a wrenching pain. I know I was wrong but I can't admit it!!! What the hell is wrong with me that I'm too proud to admit when I am wrong! Sheesh I am so bull-headed sometimes.

I recently learned my parents go through my files and there's nothing I can do about it! That makes me so mad. So instead of giving my money to c8 I'm going to use it to buy a laptop because it will give me the security I so need. 

I've been having weird daydreams of killing people. That isn't bad if I don't act on them right? I think I need to go see a psychatrist. In fact people have told me that too.... So I think I will. I can make myself better. Well till tommorow when I think I'll spend a day at Chelsea's relaxing. Yes that's what I need a nice long holiday...."

(There were three of us) Also yesterday I had a man make fun of me because I like computers (He says the economy is going down because of them but not because of the working force) and because he thought I never went outside. Well news flash I do! He was nothing compared to these three girls I met. If only Jacob and Sam didn't ditch me (two of my best friends) I may have avoided a argument oh well. They made fun of my clothes and here's a tip most people will never give you. When people make fun of you agree with them. Act smarter than they are because in reality you are. Oh I was a total mystery to them and I just started to walk away whistling when they asked ""Did we tell you could leave?"" Then I said alright. Then they asked ""You know we're doing you a favour by talking to you"" At this I went into fits of laughter. These girls contradicted themselves alot. I feel sorry because they look like they never enjoy life and are always worrying about how ""cool"" they are. When two girls walked by us while we were having this conversation the girls went into security check mode. ""Do we know her?"" ""Is she cool"" ""Is she in our group"" Once again I had to keep myself from laughing. Oh yes yesterday was fun. One last thing I did then. I saw Resident Evil the movie with Chelsea *Because my freind Jacob couldn't cause he had to leave* I have to say if I had never played RE the game it would get a 3/5 star but I have sooo..... Anyhoo the story was great at the beganing until the entire swat team died with the exception of three people. Then in the end only the lead charachter survives and the entire city is in shambles. Needless to say I hate sad endings. (I'm a very passionate man) So that's today entry that talked about yesterday."

You are very nice and<br>compassionate but you aren't afraid to let<br>others know when you're mad, it is more of a<br>bodily sign mostly in the eyes.

You tend to be a charity case and try<br>to help others feel less gloomy and<br>inadvertently make it worse.

  4  </font>

</center>

<font color=""#000000"">
You are the most trustworthy, practical, and down-to-earth of individuals; the cornerstone members of society. 

The goal of your life path is learning to take orders and to carry them out with dedication and perseverance. 

You always demand as much from yourself as you do from others, and sometimes a lot more. 



You have the kind of will power that is often mistaken for sheer stubbornness. 

Once a decision is made, it will be followed through to the conclusion, right, wrong, or indifferent.

You are very set in your ways and determined to handle things the way you are so certain that they should be handled. Your tenacity of purpose and ability to get the job done borders on obsession.



You are an excellent organizer and planner because of your innate ability to view things in a very common sense and practical way. 

You are a wonderful manager with a great sense of how to get the job done.



Loyal and devoted, you make the best of your relationships, and you are a dependable business partner. 

Friends may be few in number, but you are very close to them and once friendships are made, they often last a lifetime. The number 4 is solidly associated with the element of earth from which it gains it strength and utter sense of reality. 

You are one of the most dependable people you know. 

If patience and determination can ever win, you are sure to achieve great success in life.



The negative side of the 4 can prove dogmatic to an excess, narrow-minded, and repressive. 

A lot of superficial people turn you off, and you lack the tact to keep your feelings from being totally clear to all around. Additionally, the negative 4 has a bad tendency to get too caught up in the daily routine of affairs.

If you're not careful, you'll often miss the big picture and major opportunities that come along once in a while.</font></td></tr></table>

You may whine at times, but you've developed a thick hard shell (like that of a crab).
You are strong willed and persistent - until you get what you want.
You never shy away from a fight, even when things get dangerous.

Your birth on the 20th day of the month adds a degree of emotion, sensitivity, and intuition to your reading. 

The 2 energy provided here is very social, allowing you to make friends easily and quickly. 

Yet you are apt to have a rather nervous air in the company of a large group. 



You have a warmhearted nature and emotional understanding that constantly seeks affection. 

You are very prone to become depressed and moody, as emotions can turn inward and cause anxiety and mental turmoil.

It can be hard for you to bounce back to reality when depression sets in. 

When things are going well, you can go just as far the other way and become extremely affectionate.</td>

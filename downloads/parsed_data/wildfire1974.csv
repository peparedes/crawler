"event","just to keep you all updated on what i have been up to.  I finally passed my CDL test and will be driving truck starting the first of October for Werner Enterprises.

I didn't get married 07-07-07.  Sad, I know.  But there is good news.  I am getting married....THIS SATURDAY!  Due to Eric driving truck and not being home to get the marriage license we opted for a 09-08-07 wedding.  Things were going....eh...with the planning.  My Matron of Honor was planning the whole thing without my opinion making a difference.  The following is a cut from another blog I keep:  


OMG! Maid of honor from hell 
Category: Goals, Plans, Hopes

Well, my maid of honor has finally pushed my last button. She has done nothing but undermine every damn decision I made for this wedding. The color of the flowers weren't right, the color of the sashes weren't right, the food being served was wrong, and on and on and on. It just got to much to bear. We are now at 14 days until the wedding and the flowers still haven't been bought to make the bouquets. So I talk to my maid of honor who insists she HAS to do the bouquets. Well we can't seem to find a day our schedules match and so I said I'll go get them myself today. Well, little miss snooty was all ""If that's what makes you happy"" and I said yes it makes me happy cuz something is getting done for the wedding. Well she got all pissy and hung up. We texted a few nasty notes to each other and I told her I was tired of her making the decisions for MY wedding (next time maybe she will decide not to elope and have her own wedding) and she texted that she was ""fucking done"". so I take that as she is out of the wedding. She says to pick up my stuff as it will be on the porch. So I gave her the things I had of hers and a check for the amount she paid on the dress and that's that. So two weeks before my wedding and I have no maid of honor. I only pray that my sister can fit into the dress comfortably so that I will have my bridal party. I also lost my acrolyte and ring bearer because her sons were supposed to be in the wedding. But we got a new ring bearer and I'll sucker someone to light candels. And you know, I'm fine with it. I haven't really lost it yet. Eric called me and I told him what happened and he said ""Just remember, it's not your fault"". I then lost it. It was probably the sweetest thing he has ever said to me. It reminds me just how much more I love him each day. So after I cried for about 5 minutes I was back to being mad at my MOH and it gave me the strength to keep going today. Got my wedding dress completed minus an applique to hide the hook for the train. I am so relieved that is done.

Well she is completely out of my life.  Krazyleesa has moved up to Maid of Honor and my sister has joined as a bridemaid.  We have a new ring bearer from Eric's side of the family and everything is pretty much set.  Another blog entry:

Wedding plans going great

Well, today my sister tried on her new dress and with some alterations will fit and therefore my bridal party is now complete again! Mom has gotten the flowers for us girls done and they are so cute! And I got the flowers I originally wanted for my bouquet so now that is done. The ribbons are almost done and the decorations just about planned out. Cookies are being completed, flower girl dress is almost done. My dress has one more applique then off to Jarvis to be pressed for the wedding. The guys are all set with their tuxes, the bridesmaids dresses are being finished. The food is being prepared by several good friends and I believe we are just about done with the planning. Surprising how a brief crisis (or jubilious action) can make things get done. Everyone is in high spirits and Eric and I are completely estatic for our day. I don't think I've ever been so happy and bubbly in my life! Only about 10 days left to enjoy my last name! It's been a great 33 years being a Greene, and I've been honored to carry that name all this time....but it's time to turn the page and start my new chapter in life. I LOVE YOU ERIC!

Not really sure what all is to be added.  Colors are Claret and Silver.  Wedding song is Big and Rich-Lost in this Moment. If you are in the area ...the Wedding is in Tidioute at 2pm with reception to follow at  the firehall.  Can't miss it...Tidioute is one street and I think I am the only wedding in town that day.  Just follow the traffic! LOL.  I will try to find time to add more after the wedding...but knowing me....it will be another 6 months or so before I get back on here.  Take care and Have a Great Day!"

"event","Well, for those of you who haven't heard yet.....I""M GETTING MARRIED!  I know, about time but it's gonna happen.  My husband to be's name is Eric.  We are gonna get hitched on 7-7-07 in my little hometown of Tidioute.  Anyone that wants to attend please let me know as through my travels I have managed to lose my address book.

P.S.  Pic is Eric's little girl, Lexi.  She's my little pickle face.  I love her so much.  Which of course is why I keep telling Eric I'm marrying him for his mom and daughter!"

<br />and require kindness. They resist
<br />confrontation at all costs. (Feeling good is
<br />more important than being good.) They are
<br />typically quiet by nature, they process
<br />things very deeply and objectively, and they
<br />are by far the best listeners of all the
<br />colors. They respect people who are kind, but
<br />recoil from perceived hostility or verbal
<br />battle.

WHITES need their quiet independence and refuse to
<br />be controlled by others. WHITES want to do
<br />things their own way, in their own time. They
<br />ask little of others, and resent others
<br />demanding much of them. WHITES are much
<br />stronger than people think because they dont
<br />reveal their feelings. WHITES are kind,
<br />non-discriminate, patient and can be
<br />indecisive, timid, and silently stubborn.
<br />When you deal with a WHITE, be kind, accept
<br />(and support) their individuality, and look
<br />for nonverbal clues to their feelings.

"event","Well, I'm back!  I was basically held down at gun point until I registered myself back on LJ. Ok...maybe it wasn't that severe, but I knew if I said no, I should run and fear for my life.  I can't remember how to do anything on here, So I'll just figure out slowly and update this properly later.  Speaking of later....LATER ALL!"

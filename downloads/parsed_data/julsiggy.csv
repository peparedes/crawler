Hi!  My journal is friends only...leave me a comment that tells me who you are and why you want to be my friend to be added.  I'll most likely add you, but I want to know WHY you actually want to read this thing.

If you're unfamiliar with Livejournal, friends only means that you have to have a Livejournal account and be listed as one of my friends in order to read the entries.  It's free, so if you're really dying to read about my <strike>lack of a</strike> life, sign up."

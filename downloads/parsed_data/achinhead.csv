I know, I know, I swore I would never take a Call Center job again, but what can I say, it's $25,000.00 a year more than the Radio station was paying me, which is WAAAY more than the last call center was paying me!

I recently found out that my mother got remarried - I'm not gonna tell you how many times she has been married - she may read this and get pissed, but here is a hint - I have more steps than the Washington Monument.

Here is the fun part, the way I found out was by getting pictures from her wedding emailed to me!

I figure she didn't invite me because she knows that putting me in any situation with an open bar can quickly make the party-giver liable for a tab as large as Liberia's national debt.

In case you can't tell, I really do find this entertaining as hell!

    Weather Bulletin - Colorado

    Priceless. Think about this for a moment.

    Denver News

    This text is from a county emergency manager out in the western part of Jefferson County after a snowstorm.

    WEATHER BULLETIN

    Up here, in the Northern Plains, we just recovered from a Historic event--- may I even say a ""Weather Event"" of ""Biblical Proportions"" --- with a historic blizzard of up to 44"" inches of snow and winds to 90 MPH that broke trees in half, knocked down utility poles, stranded hundreds of motorists in lethal snow banks, closed ALL roads, isolated scores of communities and cut power to 10's of thousands.

    FYI:

    George Bush did not come.

    FEMA did nothing.

    No one howled for the government.

    No one blamed the government.

    No one even uttered an expletive on TV.

    Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton did not visit.

    Our Mayor did not blame Bush or anyone else.

    Our Governor did not blame Bush or anyone else, either.

    CNN, ABC, CBS, FOX or NBC did not visit - or report on this category 5 snowstorm.

    Nobody demanded $2,000 debit cards.

    No one asked for a FEMA Trailer House.

    No one looted.

    Nobody - I mean Nobody demanded the government do something.

    Nobody expected the government to do anything, either.

    No Larry King, No Bill O'Rielly, No Oprah, No Chris Mathews and No Geraldo Rivera. No Shaun Penn, No Barbara Striesand, No Hollywood types to be found.

    Nope, we just melted the snow for water.

    Sent out caravans of SUV's to pluck people out of snow engulfed cars. The truck drivers pulled people out of snow banks and didn't ask for a penny. 
    Local restaurants made food and the police and fire departments delivered it to the snowbound families.

    Families took in the stranded people - total strangers.

    We fired up wood stoves, broke out coal oil lanterns or Coleman lanterns.

    We put on extra layers of clothes because up here it is ""Work or Die"".

    We did not wait for some affirmative action government to get us out of a mess created by being immobilized by a welfare program that trades votes for 'sittin at home' checks.

    Even though a Category ""5"" blizzard of this scale has never fallen this early, we know it can happen and how to deal with it ourselves. 


Editors note:
Before you get your panties all in a twist and start thinking I'm an insensitive asshole for not caring about the plight of NOLA, go right ahead and kiss my ass now. Thanks!

Arnold Schwarznegger is a lefty, communist, Hillary Clinton wannabe, traitor to his party and his country.

'Nuff said? It should be, except I'm sure a few of you are only reading my journal to spy on me to get talking points for your campaigns, so I'll clarify.

For those of you who don't live in California and are too busy to bother with unimportant things like reading a newspaper, let me fill you in on some of the ""features"" of his plan:

* California employers of 10 or more workers will be required to offer health insurance or else pay 4% of their payroll into a state insurance coverage program.

* All children will be covered by insurance, either private or through the state, including illegal alien minors.

* Doctors will pay 2%, and hospitals 4%, of their gross earnings to the state to subsidize insurance for low-income Californians.

<b>Are you shitting me?</b>

Look, everyone knows there are issues with the healthcare system in America. However, None of these are solutions to those problems.

The problem with healthcare in America is simple, we don't allow the free enterprise system to work in that industry. Federal law mandates that emergency rooms treat everyone who walks in regardless of their ability to pay (which naturally encourages a system of freeloaders), the second issue is that by interjecting third and fourth parties into the payment process we remove the main driving forces that could keep healthcare costs reasonable and allow hospitals and doctors to make a profit/living. Adding more ""taxation"" to anything rarely improves it's performance.

The problem with employers and insurance companies managing the negotiations and payments for healthcare is that you and I don't see the costs, the benefits, or provide the price-point feedback to the providers that typically drives costs down through competition in a consumer-driven marketplace.

Let's go through some of those ""highlights"" and think about them.

1. <i>California employers of 10 or more workers will be required to offer health insurance or else pay 4% of their payroll into a state insurance coverage program.</i>

A) When did it become okay for the government to impose itself into the contractual agreements between employer and employee?

B) EVERYONE agrees that small business are what drive the economy, make innovative changes in the way things are done, and generate new jobs, does Arnold seriously think that small businesses can absorb yet more punishment from the government? Having been a small business owner I can tell you that the paperwork, legal issues and risks of personal liability are already so oppressive that it boggles the mind. Adding a tax ( and don't fool yourself into thinking that is not a tax - it is) to small business will crush small business development and expansion - large businesses already provide healthcare for their employees - and as an aside, that is a large portion of the reason that car manufacturers can't be competitive, they are trying to run two business, car manufacturing and and insurance company, don't get me started on how bad unions are for this country - anyway, back to my point small, growing, innovative businesses are clearly targeted by this plan.

2. <i>Doctors will pay 2%, and hospitals 4%, of their gross earnings to the state to subsidize insurance for low-income Californians.</i>

A) Sure, taxing doctors and hospitals seems like a good idea, right? Hell no! All it will do is drive them to either stop providing services or increase their fees. Let me ask you a question - if gas stations were required to hand over 4% of their profits to the government to provide fuel for those who can't afford it, what would their response be? Answer: Raise prices by 6%. So that you and I would again be forced to bear the burden.

3. <i>All children will be covered by insurance, either private or through the state, including illegal alien minors.</i>

A) WHAT????? Is he seriously stating explicitly that the American taxpayer now has to pay for healthcare for illegal aliens?

Look, the long and short of this is that health insurance is not a constitutional right, it is a personal responsibility. The secret to managing health care costs is to make consumers pay for their care. Larger deductibles and co-payments. Consumers have to understand that health care costs money, and they need to make informed economic decisions about what care they receive and what care they do not accept. Keeping demand under control is the missing piece.

Keep government out of business. Especially my business. Especially my health business.

Send me money so I can run for Governor of California to keep him from ruining business."

A few years ago, an IU student named Jill Behrman disappeared while riding her bike. It was big news around Indiana, and rightfully so, having three daughters I could imagine the heartache her family must have felt wondering what had happened, if she were alive or dead, and where she was.

She was found killed in a wooded area. I'm not going to discuss the specifics, it is painful to think about - if you are curious, it shouldn't be hard to discover all you would ever want to have nightmares about by doing a casual search on the web.

The trial of her accused killer ended the other night after 12 days of testimony.

It took the jury less than an hour - some reports actually said only 15 minutes - to decide he was guilty.

Less than an hour to carefully sift and weigh the evidence, the testimony and the facts surrounding the case.

Less than an hour to essentially sentence a man to die.

Those of you who know me know that as surprising as it may be I don't support the death penalty. I think it is flat wrong for lots of reasons, but there is one reason that soars above all others - I believe that innocent people are sentenced to die by juries of their peers all the time.

All reports state clearly that there was no physical evidence in this case, that all of the evidence was circumstantial. Based primarily on things he said to various people.

I can't get my head around seeing a man die because of things he said. How many conversations have you had in your life, where if portions were taken out of context, you would suffer?

I'm afraid that he was convicted because our community needs to see someone pay for the crime that was done, and that we don't really care if he was innocent or guilty, so long as we can feel better about him being gone.

Send me money so I can get drunk and think more deeply on this."

"event","I apologize to those swarming hordes of fans who have been anxiously awaiting my LJ posts.

I haven't had much to inspire me to write lately, but two things have happened recently that made me want to let you know what I think.

1. Jon Benet Ramsey. We all know the horrific story of this little girl, so I'm not going to go into it, I do want to volunteer to fix the guy they caught though. I have a specific treatment plan that I'm certain will ensure he never does that to another little girl.

The first step in my treatment involves taking him out in the woods and nailing his sack to a tree stump, then setting the stump on fire and offering him a dull, rusty knife which he is welcome to use in order to free himself. 

2. AOL releasing it's search data to the public. Since I'm in the technical industry, I've always had a poor overall impression of AOL's service, software and customers. If any of you are AOL users, please don't be offended - I say this in the same spirit in which I would say ""I think gun-toting, religious fanatics are assholes."" There may be exceptions, and you are probably one. :)

I found a site which listed the contents of those searches, and I found it extremely amusing. For example, the single biggest query was ""www.google.com"". 

I've always considered AOL the ""Gated Community"" version of the internet, and wondered why anyone would use their service. We were all ""new"" to the internet at some point ( I hate to admit that back when I was new we actually surfed in text browsers  - gives my age away), but how long do you need your hand held? 

I guess the answer is ""For as long as I type the complete web address of a search engine into another search engine to try to navigate to the site"". ROFL.

If I've annoyed you because you are an AOL user, I would like to point out that you should be annoyed at AOL, not me."

BOOTY CALL CONTRACT

This pre-booty call agreement (hereinafter referred to as the ""Agreement"") is entered into on the _____day of __________, 2004, between _____________ and ______________. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL COVER THE FOLLOWING RULES AND PRINCIPLES:
1. There shall be NO sleeping over -- unless the sex is so good that it justifies a repeat performance in the morning.
2. We shall NOT meet in public except for dinner or drinks before the carnal events of the evening.
3. Do NOT call me before 10:00 PM -- we don't have shit to talk about.
4. There will be NO ""love making"" -- only sex is allowed.
5. Under NO circumstances will there be any emotional discussions. These include questions like ""Where are we heading with this?""; ""Do you love me?""; and ""What are you thinking?"" The answers are ""nowhere,"" ""hell no,"" and ""about someone else,"" so don't ask.
6. We will NOT make plans in advance -- that is why you are called the ""back-up,"" unless you are from out-of-town, then it's only a one-time advance arrangement.
7. All gifts are gratefully accepted -- money is always the best gift.
8. NO talk of marriage shall ever be uttered -- however, dirty talk and screaming is encouraged.
9. Please do NOT ask for comparisons with former lovers -- it's really none of your damn business. This rule shall be null and void if you are asking to include former lovers in our session.
10. We are NOT friends, just sex-buddies.
11. Calling out the wrong name during sex is OK -- don't be offended if there are multiple names called out and references made to college parties, cheerleader camps, or women's [men's] prisons.
12. Do NOT wear extra clothing -- I want it fast, easy, and I sure as hell don't want your ass leaving anything behind when you leave.
13. You will NOT fall asleep right after sex -- Consider my cry of ""Oh, shit, I'm cuming!"" to be your cue to start gathering your things so you can get the fuck home.
14. Do NOT be offended if I don't ask if you enjoyed it -- I don't care.
15. You can NOT borrow my car for any reason.
16. If anyone asks who you are, the standard response will be: ""His roommate's girlfriend [boyfriend].""
17. You must confirm ALL visits. An unanswered phone call does not constitute confirmation.
18. If you don't want hot, wet, messy sex, do NOT come over. [See number 10]
19. Bring your own drinks -- I don't run a liquor store. Better yet, bring me a fifth of Jack Daniels!
20. You will NOT use my phone under any circumstance. This is not the movies -- everyone has Caller ID, and I don't want anyone calling for you at my place. By signing below, I agree to all of the above rules, regulations, stipulations, references, and inuendos. Furthermore, if I break this covenant, I will give sloppy road-head to the co-signer of this agreement during a drive of his/her choosing.

An open letter to my wife.

Darling,

I wanted to take a few moments to publicly remind you of how dear you are to me. 

I recently read an entry in your blog and just had a conversation with you where I was joking, but think I actually hurt your feelings when you asked me what I thought about - when I thought about you -  all of which led me to believe that you may have forgotten how much I adore you, and I am to blame for that. I have no excuse for letting you forget how much you mean to me, but I can plead a hectic life schedule as a contributing factor.

My love, I would like to start by reminding you of our history together.

When we met, you were a young woman, and I was *ahem* slightly older. I fell in love with you immediately. 

We were broke, but still seemed to manage to have a good time together. Some of my fondest memories from those days include calling and being blown off for dates, kissing you passionately in the park, a first date at a grocery store, a second date doing laundry, being pinned in the corner of a sofa listening to a Lenny Kravitz CD on repeat over and over as an insane cat bit my legs, our trip to the James Dean Museum, locking your car keys in your trunk and having to take the back seat out of your car to get at them, lawn chairs in the living room, walking to my mom's house so your dad would not know I had spent the night when he dropped by for a surprise visit - then watching you drive past me with him, slamming the door on my way out after some petty disagreement - then having to come back in and ask you where my car keys were, discovering that you did not like warm tuna after scrounging in the pantry and being so proud of myself for inventing a recipe based on what was available, buying concert tee shirts to keep your legs warm when we saw Neil Young, taking you to my great grandmother's birthday party to meet the family.

We got a little less broke, and moved into a ""nice"" apartment in Indianapolis. The memories I have from there are some of my very happiest: ""Rigor Mortis!"", wrestling you in bed, lazy weekends where we only got out of bed to make food, buying our first grill and making chops and steaks on our minuscule balcony, buying ""new"" furniture at a used furniture store and decorating the house - we actually had stuff that matched and wasn't hand me downs or yard sale rejects! You falling asleep and forgetting to pick me up from work, taking you to see Steely Dan when you had no idea who the hell they were and dancing in the aisle with you during the show, selling plasma to buy a cheap engagement ring, then taking a small plane over downtown Indianapolis to propose and the sudden fear when it took you a moment to agree to be my wife, dinner at the Olive Garden after you accepted and boring the waitress with our excitement at being engaged, thinking right up until the last moment that I was actually going to have to work at my crap job on the day of our wedding, seeing you in your dress and feeling my heart stop at how beautiful you looked, thanking God that you were willing to promise to spend the rest of your life with me, rolling pennies to pay for our wedding reception, being so exhausted on our wedding night that all we REALLY wanted to do was sleep, realizing that I had forgotten to get champagne for our honeymoon night, and going to the liquor store in my tux to pick some up, taking my bride back to our apartment.

We were still broke, but found a little house we loved, somehow we managed to get into it and actually buy it! Remember how empty it seemed when we first moved in? Checking the pee-o-meter to see if we were going to be parents, better jobs, feeling so afraid in the hospital after hearing about the family tragedies from pitocin, forgetting to hold your leg as you pushed because I was so enthralled by our oldest daughter's birth, turning into my mom, and taking 4,000 pictures of my new family in the first 2 days, putting sunglasses on her - putting her in a car seat, getting home and then looking at you across the top of the car and asking what we do with her now? 8 hours to open presents, hearing first laughs, seeing first smiles, Happy dances. A better job with a worse boss, a small business we thought would make us rich - working together and both so passionate about it that we often argued, worrying about my nephews and sister, discussing what we should do, whether we should do it, and if so when, remodeling a bathroom, seeing the drag queens perform, ""My friend Bob is bald"", the limo ride, checking the pee-o-meter again, an early delivery, bringing home someone else to love, recognizing that we needed a bigger house, Sunday mornings watching Bob Villa and eating carry out Bob Evans, blue air vents, flying a kite at the church, B.B. King, The Galt House, and a blow job in the back seat.

We moved into a bigger house. My happy memories include our oldest contributing her pocket money to the down payment so she could feel like it was her house too, putting the ""sold"" signs up, stopping for my lucky whopper with cheese on the way to the hospital, another new family member to love who still brings joy just because of her sunny personality, mornings on the back porch drinking coffee and smoking, while we planned landscaping and decor, sitting on the back porch while you and the kids were out on the lawn and looking up and praying for the first time in many years just to tell God how thankful I was for you and the children, footstool sex, planning a housewarming party that still hasn't happened! :} -  fearing things I had never feared before and having you there to talk it over with, community and business involvement, OUR FIRST EVER BRAND NEW MATTRESS - Talking dirty to you and copping secret feels while we were mattress shopping, and trying it out when we got it home. The Bahamas, Brown County on Valentines day, open discussions, happiest years of our marriage.

Those are just the high points of the last 15 years. I have a thousand other warm, happy memories tucked away that I pull out and examine often, a million moments of joy with you.

The happiest I can feel is when I look ahead to the times you and I still have coming down the road, we're closer than ever to achieving the things we've dreamed of achieving.

I'm so proud of you, I know that the new challenges you are taking on will offer opportunity for stress, but they also offer validation of the things I already know about you - your intelligence and charisma, your expertise at what you do and how you do it. I'm excited at the new life that is opening to you, the feelings you are about to have, the people you are about to meet and the impact you are about to make on a new company.

Like every couple, we have experienced trouble, we've caused each other pain, we've caused each other pleasure. The memories I have of those unpleasant times dims in comparison to the flood of memories I have of joy and love, and pleasure experienced with my wife.

I love you, and I hope you know it.

To everyone besides my wife: Please send me money so I can buy her presents"

Today in a surprise announcement, Achinhead related that LiveJournal pissed him off.

Mr. Achinhead was attempting to accomplish what would normally seem like a simple task - namely, after reading back through his LJ and determining that all the Memes and Quizzes. etc. did nothing to let others know what he was really like as a person, and furthermore served as public displays of his laziness and lack of independent or creative thought - he reached an almost unheard of decision - to REMOVE them.

Unfortunately, in the cheap bastard version of LJ - known to some as the ""Free"" account, there appears to be no simple way to  either:

1) Display all entries, and either delete or make private multiple entries at one time or 
2) Even display all entries.

So although a valiant effort was made on the part of our intrepid bed-wetting, Live Journal narcissist to remove some of his protective coloration, the ultimate result was a failure of mammoth proportions.

Please send money to the victim's fund, care of Achinhead."

""Feds seek Google search records

The federal government has asked Google to turn over search records as part of its battle to protect an antipornography law.

According to an article in the San Jose Mercury News, lawyers for the Justice Department issued a subpoena to the search company last year, asking for ""one million random Web addresses and records of all Google searches from any one-week period.""

The government is seeking the records to bolster its argument in a federal court in Pennsylvania over the constitutionality of the Child Online Protection Act. Google has refused to comply with the order, saying ""the demand for the information is overreaching,"" the paper said.""

Okay, does anyone but me feel threatened by this? I'm not into child porn, but they didn't request information about searches for child porn - they requested ALL searches.

Again, I'm forced to point out that I've suddenly become a suspect. Apparently searching Google has become probable cause.

Prediction: Someone smarter than me will come up with an encrypted search engine that automagically hides requesting IP addresses and search terms and they will make a fortune.

Have you ever watched one of these? I have no idea how they decide who gets to go first, I even actually searched google to try to learn, but was unsuccessful.

However they do decide, and just for ""annoyance"" (see previous post) I'm going to arbitrarily state that they decide based on a coin toss.

Now, I said all that to say this:

It ought to just be called the ""Coin Toss Championship"" because whoever goes first clears the table and wins.

Watching other people play pool has all the grandeur, excitement and majesty of watching grass grow. 

Just get everyone all dressed up, go to the pool hall and flip the coin. Whoever wins the coin toss is declared the champion, and we can get on with important TV fare like Women's Beach Volleyball."

"event","It's official.

I'm now a fugitive from justice.

Our esteemed politicians have seen fit to pass a law that makes it a federal crime to annoy someone over the internet without disclosing your true identity.

Here is the relevant part:

""Whoever...utilizes any device or software that can be used to originate telecommunications or other types of communications that are transmitted, in whole or in part, by the Internet... without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person...who receives the communications...shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both."" 

I'm fairly confident that at some point, I've said something that annoyed someone.

Naturally, they claim that we can count on what they call (with a straight face) ""prosecutorial discretion"" to avoid being prosecuted for - say - creating a blog that suggests that the prosecutor running for re-election is not as well qualifed as another candidate. Gosh, I bet the prosecutor would be annoyed.

Notice that the law actually says ""annoy"". It doesn't leave it at harrass, stalk, threaten, or anything a semi-normal person would expect and potentially even see as reasonable. We won't even bother worrying about that pesky First Amendment thing.

Of course, it was inevitable, once the soccer moms made it criminal for two kids to fight on the playground - which reminds me of another rant I'll try to get in later - it was a downhill slide from there to being illegal to annoy someone.

So, I assume I'm currently a fugitive from federal prosecution. In lieu of money, Please send soap on a rope so I can be prepared for my upcoming incarceration*.

Thanks.



* Some lube might be good too.

P.S. I'm filing charges against whoever posted the law to the internet - I'm annoyed, see I can prove it, look at my ""mood"" icon."

""A religion teacher assigned her class an essay on what makes a good Christian. One student wrote about praying nightly, say no to abortion, banning gay marriage, and donating money. The other student wrote about talking to God and allowing people to enjoy their lives, and supporting gay marriage. The day the teacher was to hand the papers back, she called up the second student and told him she would pray for him when he went to hell. The student asked why would he be going to hell, and why he got an F on his paper. The teacher told him that Catholisim is against gay marriage. The student looked at her for a minute, then said aloud, ""I'm gay."" The teacher kicked him out of class as if he had said fuck or worshiped Satan. A girl in the back of class who had a boyfriend and was obviously straight got up and left too.

If you would leave the classroom, repost this. It doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, or gay. It doesn't matter if you're catholic or not. Everyone is a human being and deserves happiness""



Okay, there is so much wrong with this post that I almost think you are trying to piss me off.

Let me start with the worst offense in the whole thing:
""Everyone is a human being and deserves happiness""

Can you really believe this?

First of all, define human being, does the fact that some small portion of our DNA differs from the chimpanzee qualify us as human beings? Or does it require higher thought processes, concern, compassion or maybe even love? Could it be that there are plenty of people walking around who don't actually qualify as human beings?

Let's for the moment accept what I consider a specious argument that our DNA qualifies us as human beings.

Just because we are going to pretend that I agree that we are all human beings, I'm not going to pretend that I agree that being human being means that we ""deserve"" happiness.

1. Happiness is in large part a decision we make as people - if you are one of those unfortunates who suffer from a chemical imbalance, or mental defect or whatever the hell it is that qualifies as depression, don't get your panties in a twist - you can still make a decision to get treatment or enhance your mental outlook through the judicious use of chemistry as defined by prescriptions or outlawed mind-altering substances, and if you can't because of some stupid-assed religious or moral conviction, then go piss up a rope, you made that choice too.

2. What the hell makes you think we ""deserve"" anything. Especially anything good. Does the child molester deserve another chance (read victim)? Does the drunk deserve another drink? Those certainly would provide happiness to those people, but if I were even silly enough to agree that they deserve happiness, should I be required to cater to what they need for happiness? What about in these cases where their happiness would make another person unhappy, or potentially worsen their lives?


Next:

In case you didn't realize it - this WAS A CHRISTIAN RELIGION CLASS.

Should be 'nuff said, but it won't be because I'm riled up.

1. First of all the little shit was probably not even gay, he just decided to irritate his religion teacher because she was an easy mark, and some of use were/are the types of little shits who enjoy poking teachers because it amused us.

2. Since we only know what the clearly biased reporter has told us about this incident, it may well be that the teacher identified this student as attempting to create controversy and disruption in the class and that was the reason he was sent out of the room - NOT because he said he was gay.

3. Why shouldn't the teacher be allowed to express her opinion in response to his opinion?

4. Catholicism has clearly defined it's stance on gay marriage and abortion. Why would you or this student be surprised at the response received.

5. ""The teacher kicked him out of class as if he had said fuck or worshiped Satan."" Why is the judgement you just made about saying fuck or worshiping Satan any less offensive than the judgement the teacher and the Catholic church have made?


Next.

The chances are excellent that this is completely made up, and I'm really annoyed that it is being posted and re-posted without any attribution. 

All of that said: Have a great day!
Crap, I crack myself up.

Send me money so I can afford to supplement my happiness by writing stuff in my LJ all day that cracks me up - after all, I deserve it!"

<i>By the time he was 16, Joseph Edward Duncan III estimated he had raped 13 younger boys, some at gunpoint, according to Pierce County court records.

At 17, after he was arrested for the rape and torture of a 14-year-old Pierce County boy in 1980, Duncan was deemed to be a sexual psychopath and as an alternative to prison was admitted for treatment to the Sex Offender Program at Western State Hospital. However, he was booted from the program after 22 months when officials learned he was sneaking off the Western campus and having ""violent rape fantasies,"" said Pierce County Prosecutor Jerry Horne. A judge then reinstated his 20-year prison sentence.</i>

"event","Normally I hold a grudge against businesses that piss me off. And once pissed off, they have typically lost a customer forever - not to mention that I actively go out of my way to bad mouth them whenever appropriate, and sometimes even when I just need to bitch about something.

Best Buy.

What a shitbox.

Let me back up a few years and relate my little story of how they initially pissed me off:

It all started one wonderful Sunday afternoon. My lovely wife and I used to have a nice Sunday routine that basically involved doing nothing all day long, we would lay around in whatever felt comfortable, read the Sunday paper and watch home-improvement shows all day. 

On this balmy Sunday the Best Buy insert in the paper had what at the time was an amazing deal on RAM (computer memory) now, at the time RAM was about $40.00 per MegaByte, and their Sunday flier was advertising it for only about $15.00 per MB. At that point in my life, I owned a Compaq which used to be notoriously finicky about the type of RAM it would accept, so I get on the Compaq website and observe that for my model, the only noted issue was that PNY memory caused blue screens.

I call Best Buy, explain that my Compaq could not use PNY memory and ask if the memory they wer advertising was PNY. ""Nope"" says the moron on the other end of the phone, ""it'll work just fine in your Compaq"".

Awesome. I jump in the car, drive to Best Buy, and walk back to the computer department, I ask the fat-assed moron behnd the counter if the memory they were selling was PNY. ""Nope"". Is the answer.

Great, I buy it. The guy hands me a generic white box that says ""RAM"" on the front. I drive home, open my PC, slap the memory in, boot - blue screen.

I take the memory out, boot just fine.

I remove the existing memory, put the new stuff in, boot - blue screen.

I then carefully examine the actual memory, and observe that it says ""PNY"" on the SIMM.

After cussing loudly - and I may add beautifully for about 10 minutes, I jump in the car with my memory and take it to Best Buy.

I wait in line for 4,000 other people who had been screwed by Best Buy to make their returns, finally, it is my turn to experience their wonderful customer service policies first-hand.

I step up to the counter and tell my tale of woe.

""No problem sir, we can get that returned for you for a 15% restocking fee"".

WHAT??!?!?!?! You have to be shitting me.

So I say - and not unreasonably I think - ""I'm not paying a restocking fee. I just want to either exchange this memory for memory that will actually work, or return it"".

The ""customer service"" person I'm dealing with explains to me that they will be happy to provide me with that service for a 15% restocking fee.

So, I ask for a manager.

Manager shows up and I tell him the whole story. His response? ""Sure, we'll have to charge you a 15% restocking fee"".

We are clearly not communicating, and it is obviously my fault, so I try to make my position clear. ""I am not paying you 15% for selling me the wrong crap"". ""Either exchange it for memory that actually works, or refund my money - and before you say it, let me reiterate that I'm NOT paying you 15%"".

He explains to me as though I'm a retard that since I've already opened the memory, they have to charge me 15% to ""repackage"" and ""restock"" the item.

I ask him how the hell I'm supposed to know that the memory is defective until I open and install it for which he naturally has no answer.

Anyway, to make an already long story a little shorter, I end up creating quite a ruckus in the store, and announce to everyone in earshot that Best Buy is trying to screw me, and that before I pay that crappy store 15% for selling me defective merchandise, I will report my credit card stolen. Furhtermore I'm done talking to your dumb ass, get someone in management on the phone.

I end up going all the way to District Manager to get them to waive that damned fee. 

So fuck Best Buy for years.

Until.....

For no apparent reason and with no warning my ex-boss hands me a $100.00 Best Buy gift card.

So the other night I propose to my lovely wife that after we have dinner at her favorite restaurant, maybe we could give Best Buy a shot because there are a couple of CDs I would like to purchase, and the surprise Best Buy gift card was like found money, so I was willing to spend it there.

We go out to dinner, have wonderful steaks and off we go to Best Buy.

I walk over to the CD section, and was amazed.

The CDs were not arranged in any logical order, not by alphabet, not by genre, not by color of the wrapping even.

It was like a bargain bin rummage sale of 3 billion CDs.

I spend a couple of minutes trying to dig through this mess, when I get frustrated, and give up, so I walk around trying to find someone that works there. Yeah, good luck.

I end up buying a sound card, (for my shitty assed HP that hasn't worked right from day one and of course Habib in tech support doesn't speak English  well enough to tell me to do anything except power cycle). And DVD+R and CDR discs, and leaving.

Then when I get home I find out I was overcharged by almost $20.00 for the CDR discs. I call them, and I'm told they can issue a refund and credit my card for only 15%.

Anyone want to buy some slightly used Best Buy gift cards?

Send me money so I can purchase enough Best Buy stock to perform a hostile take-over and fire everyone in their management."

"event","As a music lover (no lie, I have about 5,000 CDs), I have a question for the record labels, the RIAA and certain artists.

Before I ask the question, I'd like to lay out their thinking - as I understand it.

It looks to me as if the group mentioned above has essentially declared war on music fans.

Suing kids and grandparents for downloading music, adding ""features"" to CDs that prevent or limit ripping and burning, and in some instances make them incompatible with the IPOD (BTW - the SINGLE GREATEST GIFT I EVER RECEIVED!), and generally doing all they can to annoy music fans and the CD buying public.

The logic behind this seems to be that it will make me buy CDs rather than download the music, and prevent me from sharing music I love with my friends.

So, I said all of that to ask them a single question:

What makes you arrogant asses so sure that I like you well enough to buy your friggin' music? Maybe I ALREADY buy the CDs from artists I like well enough to, and download the music of those I would never spend a nickle on - <i>because</i> I don't like them well enough to spend my hard earned dollar on their music.

And the follow-up question:
So, if that is the case, how is my downloading hurting you? Would you rather I never heard your music? Does art even exist without someone to appreciate it?

The RIAA can blow me.

Send me money so I can go buy another 5,000 CDs."

"event","I was just thinking about another reason to kick my own ass.

It's simple really, I can't believe I let someone else think of this idea.

Payday Loans.

Shit, what a money maker.

Look, let's imagine for a moment that you are a little short this week, so you go get a payday loan.

To keep it simple for myself, I'm gonna say you earn $200.00 per paycheck, and you are $50.00 short this payday because you have to buy a pack of gum or whatever.

So, you go down, and write a post-dated check for a loan.

The way it works is: you write the check for $90.00, $50.00 cash, plus a $40.00 fee. (I'm making these numbers up, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were close to correct).

So, payday rolls around, and you realize that this time, you are gonna be $90.00 short, because that check is coming out!

So you trot down to the check cashing place, and tell them you either need another loan, or you need more time to pay your existing loan.

Naturally, they are happy to oblige by rolling your loan over for another week. For another $40.00 fee.

So let's summarize. Last week you were $50.00 short. This week you are $90.00 short. Next week you will be $130.00 short. All of it going to your friendly neighborhood loanshark, er, payday loan company.

Do you see a pattern here?

Wow, what a money making model, and don't whine to me about taking advantage of idiots. That is what God put them here for, my entertainment and enrichment.

Man I wish I had thought of that."

I just wanted to let my friends know that I had an awesome day!

My lovely wife and children got me tickets to Indy Jazz Fest which I went to on Saturday night. Great time, and I'd been trying to see Susan Tedeschi for awhile so I was really excited. If it wasn't for my stupid, inflexible, crappy job and the fact that they only sold Budweiser, the night would have been perfect.

The lineup at the stage we sat at was:

Susan Tedeschi (Awesome, kind of a cross between Bonnie Raitt and Janis Joplin)
David Sanborn (not too into smooth jazz, but if you are, he's probably worth seeing.)
Chris Bhouti (Jazz trumpet player and one of People Magazine's ""Most Beautiful People"" although I'm not sure what that has to do with his musicianship, they made a big deal of it.)
The Commodores (Since there are only 2 original members left, they are more of a Commodores tribute act than a band - but they played all of their old hits, and the crowd responded pretty well.)

Best of all, we went with some really good friends, and had a really good time, roughly 7 hours of music for a measly $15.00, plus $6,000.00 for 2 beers.

Then Sunday, the big day arrives.

My wife's father, step-mom and half-brother came over to visit us, so we grilled out, and my wife made some  really fantastic snack foods after a  trip to the local farmer's market.

The wife and kids got me some new golf shirts which I desperately needed.

My dad, as some of you know lives with us. We keep him chained to a radiator in the basement and let him out only under carefully controlled conditions.

Since it was Father's day, we let him out for the dinner we had, then about 6:30 he and I took our guitars up to a local micro-brewery for an open stage night.

Dad actually played, and he rocked. I think he had a good time, even though he complained bitterly that he forgot what key one of the tunes he was planning to play was actually in. I couldn't think of anything interesting to play so I watched and talked with a couple of local music personalities.

About 10:30 or so, I wandered into the warm-up room, tuned my guitar and started warming up, and trying to figure out something to play, when dad walked back and told me they were closing! Shit.

By this time dad was about 3/4 of the way into the bag anyway, and I Was driving so I only had one beer, so we packed up and left.

On the way home Dad told me it was one of the best Father's days he had ever had - that was kind of cool.

So that was my father's day. Hope you guys all had the chance to see or talk to your dad, and I hope all you dads had a great one."

I'm really excited because Susan Tedeschi is playing.

My darling also invited some friends of ours to go with us.

The problem is that I have to work today. So in order to go to the fest, I have to leave work early.
There are two problems with this: 1. I just put in for a promotion, so splitting early doesn't look too hot, and 2. It means I leave my co-workers under-staffed, which makes me feel like an ass.

I tried to get someone to cover my shift for me but naturally, no one who isn't required to work on Saturday wants to do so, and our great company just made it a fireable offense to get overtime.

All of this means that I'll leave early to make my lovely wife happy, and to meet the agreement my wife made to meet our friends, and to enjoy seeing Susan Tedeschi, then feel guilty and paranoid the whole time so I won't be able to relax and enjoy myself.

Naturally, I have TOMORROW and Monday off, so I'll have an additional two days to worry and fret about this.

Sitcoms.

Has anyone but me noticed how men are portrayed in these damned things?

All of the men seem to be fat-assed, half-wits, who are magically endowed with the ability to marry smart, beautiful women who somehow manage to tolerate their husband's bumbling.

All the producers did was take I Love Lucy and reverse the roles.

Don't get me wrong, the reason I don't watch sitcoms is that all of the jokes in them were old when Adam met Eve, not because of this.

Has anyone else noticed this? Or is it jut me getting old and grumpy?"

"event","So, I did the LJ trading card thing-a-ma-bob below, which credits <lj user=crossfire_>, so I decided to visit his LJ.

I like it.

In general we probably have radically different viewpoints on many things, and I strongly suspect that our votes effectively cancel one another's out on most items.

We do agree on a couple of things though, and his post at http://www.livejournal.com/users/crossfire_/247255.html made me think of one of them.

Gay marriage.

Can anyone explain to me why people are all up in arms over this? I'm a 40 year old, white republican, and for the life of me, I can't understand why gay marriage should bother me or my party.

How does it negatively impact my life, the lives of other straight people, my children, my community, my country? Seriously.

Everytime I see one of those church-supplied bumper stickers that has ""a stick figure of a man + the stick figure of a woman = Marriage"" a couple of thoughts go through my mind, and in this order:

1. What a fucking idiot.
2. Obviously they can't read well enough to educate themselves, or they wouldn't have to resort to stick figure drawings in order to communicate their beliefs.
3. What a fucking idiot.
4. Why are they so worked up about this particular issue? Especially considering all the other crap going on in the world.
5. Fucking idiot put a sticker on their car - good luck selling that one.

Believe it or not, I'm not anti-religion, I AM somewhat anti-church, but I actually seriously considered entering the ministry when younger, and I have read the bible word-for-word, and on more than one occasion.

My point is, if you have developed your opinion on this issue through interpretation of the bible, you may want to consider where that path may lead.

Do you REALLY want this country to become a theocracy? And which sect/cult should be in charge? How do you decide? Don't answer by majority, 'cause guess what dipshit, that is a democracy, which is fundamentally incompatible with a theocratic government system.

That is a rant for another time however.

What I really want to know is: if you are against gay marriage, please post - even if anonymously - and help me understand your viewpoint. I am thoroughly confused by it and look forward to being educated.

Thanks, and don't forget to send me money so I can make bumper stickers to sell to idiots."

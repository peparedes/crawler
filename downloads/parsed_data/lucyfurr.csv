So I read a link on CNN a while back about this so called ""miracle fruit"". It makes food which is normally sour taste sweet. Apparently this little fruit that is native to western Africa contains a protein that binds to the taste receptors on your tongue. The main affect lasts for about a half hour, but up to two hours later things still taste a bit sweeter than they should.

So after reading about these, I knew I had to try it. I found a place that sells the berries. It cost just under $100 for them ($60 for 20 berries, $32 to have them FedEx'd out in dry ice).

I made a trip to the store and bought some sour stuff, and then rounded up other things that might be interesting from my house:

Here is all the stuff prepared:

I ate the the berry and it was mostly bland but had a mild somewhat pleasant sweet taste. I waited a couple minutes and then sampled everything. Here are the results:

<b>Cider Vinegar:</b> Dipped a spoon in, tasted like cider. Had to pour it out because I wanted to drink it.
<b>Pineapple:</b> Made a very bland and somewhat under ripe pineapple sweet and yummy
<b>Lemons:</b> They tasted like candy, similar to lemonheads or a really sweet lemondrop
<b>Meyer Lemons:</b> These tasted like oranges, almost too sweet.
<b>Blueberries:</b> No sour taste, just sweet blueberries, super awesome!
<b>Sour Cream:</b> Made it sweet, fucking disgusting.
<b>Blackberries:</b> Very sweet, no tartness at all.
<b>Raspberries:</b> Super awesome strong sweet raspberry taste, one of my favorites.
<b>Strawberries:</b> Tasted like someone poured sugar over them, I inhaled those fuckers!
<b>Radishes:</b> Tasted exactly the same. I found them to be useful though for cleansing the palate
<b>Kiwis:</b> I spit this out, too sweet, the first thing I thought of is a shoe
<b>Limes:</b> Tasted like candy, I was eatin' these things up
<b>Cranberries:</b> Went from super sour/bitter to tasting like the cranberry stuff served at Thanksgiving
<b>Pink Grapefruit:</b> Made this too sweet, ruined a perfectly good grapefruit.
<b>Franks Red Hot:</b> Added sweetness, reminded me of Tobasco. I hate Tobasco. Gross.
<b>Mango Sorbet:</b> Waaaaay too sweet, nasty.
<b>Gatorade:</b> Made my Gatorade taste like some ghetto ass kool-aid. gross.

The really cool thing about the whole experience is that it made foods with almost no sugar taste like they were dipped in sugar. Something with maybe 20 calories tastes like it has 200 calories! I think next time I eat one I am going to see what it does to carrots and plain oatmeal with nothing added at all whatsoever. Thinking about making a cake too with absolutely no sugar at all whatsoever in it.

Anyways, its really neat stuff, and amazing how your taste buds can be tricked like that. I recommend the experience to others.

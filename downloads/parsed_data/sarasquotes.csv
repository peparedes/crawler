Give dance hall bands not golden harps

""This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."" 

""Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the Earth with your eyes turned skyward. For it is there that you have been and it its there that you will always long to be.""

""We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams.""

""A bird may love a fish, signore, but where will they live? I shall have to make you wings!"" 

""Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.""

And finally, a poem from the AIDS quilt that made me bawl...

""Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there, I do not sleep
I am a thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints on snow
I am the sunlight on ripened grain
I am the gentle autumn's rain
When you awaken in the morning's hush
I am the swift uplifting rush 
of quiet birds in circled flight
I am the soft star that shines at night
Do not stand at my grave and cry
I am not there, I did not die."""

Finally and most importantly...

My friend, I hate to do this, but our friendship just can't last. The time we shared together has all faded in the past. I told you this would happen...our friendship was bound to end. Although I know you care, I can't consider you a friend. Please don't try to argue, but try to understand...that time can change two people like the tide can change the sand. Our friendship has been lovely, but you see it just wouldn't do. For now I see you in a different way. I've fallen in love with you..."

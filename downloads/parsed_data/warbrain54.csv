matt skiba is god and im in love with this song

You're walking the thin line
Between here and out of control
You kept me in mind
You got the paper cuts to prove it
Your sea sick smile
Screams sweet nausea
'76 was a good year for me
It's been awful since then
Don't cry or stop to wonder why
We crashed out the thunder
On the floor down from the ceiling
It was nice waking up next to you
Then you crossed the line
Between here and out of this world
You blow my mind
Like a colt '45 every time
Don't cry or stop to wonder why
We crossed out our thunder
On the floor down from the ceiling
It's been nice waking up next to you
Don't cry or stop to wonder why
We crossed out our thunder
On the floor down from the ceiling
It's been nice waking up next to...
You...
And our sea sick smiles
Screaming home sweet home
 

i love you so much kelly"

I deleted the goddamn comments.  Matt hasn't gotten them yet, and never will.  He never did shit, so stop being a cocksucker.  ...get a fucking life.  You are SO PATHETIC.  You're NEVER going to see my fucking boyfriend again.  I'm NEVER speaking to you again.  You two are NEVER going to fight, so you'll NEVER have the chance to gang up on him w/like ten other ppl so he doesn't have a chance.  Go get laid... maybe you won't have so much fucking aggression all the time.  And you KNOW you started this shit so dont turn it around.  I don't ask for money from people.  Ask my goddamn friends if u don't believe me.  If anything, I GIVE things to people.  I don't know HOW many times I've given out money to my friends when they really needed it.  And why the fuck should you care anyways?  You have MY shit!  Stay out of my life.  I DON'T WANT you in it.  Seriously.  GET IT IN YOUR HEAD.  Seeing you makes me want to fucking vomit all over myself.  Stop trying to start shit with people who don't deserve it because you think it makes you a badass.  Well, you're still NOT a badass, and you fucking know it.  This is the last time I'm speaking (typing... I'll NEVER SPEAK) to you ever again.  And drop off my goddamn guitar.  I know you've had time.

Bye."

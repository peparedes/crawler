If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it. "" - Arthur

k heres a big one
 - Distance logger ( athletes will b able to log how many miles they ran, wat shoes, wat route, wat type of weather, wat pace etc. ) zelwak told me to add in this feature cause it will b really helpful
 - It will also have a Distance Graph, where it will create a graph from a starting date to end date of how many miles u ran, etc. (U will b able to select the start and end date)
 
 - It will also have reminders, so u will b able to add ur own reminders such as project due tmrw and tell it to remind u at 10 pm and the program will run in the background and wen its 10 pm it will pop up and say u hav a project due etc. 

- Also coach will b able to add reminders from his program tat i will supply him, so he can b like ""faraz u need to run 2 miles tmrw at 7 am"", and wen i open the program on my computer it will tell me zelwak's message"

Your birth on the 2nd day of the month adds a degree of emotion, sensitivity, and intuition to your life. 

The 2 is a very social number allowing you to make friends easily and quickly. 

Yet you are apt to have a rather nervous air in the company of a large group. 



You have a warmhearted nature and emotional understanding that constantly seeks affection. 

You are more prone than most to become depressed and moody, as emotions can turn inward and cause anxiety and mental turmoil. 

It can be hard for you to bounce back to reality when depression sets in.</td>

Let p and q be whole numbers with no common factor greater than one and let (p/q)^2 = 2 , (i.e. that p/q is the square root of two) 

This gives us p^2 = 2(q^2), p^2 therefore is an even number, and so is p.

Since p is even, we can write it as 2k for some value of k.

Substituting 2k = p into p^2 = 2(q^2) gives us the equation 4(k^2) = 2(q^2).

The above can be simplified to 2(k^2) = q^2, which means q is even.  This, however, contradicts our initial statement that p and q are whole numbers with no common factor greater than one, since both p and q have been found to be even, and therefore have a common factor of two.  This contradiction leads us to conclude that the square root of two cannot be expressed as a fraction, and so is irrational.

Essentially the proof works by assuming the contrary to what we seek to prove, we then define what it means for this contrary assumption to be true and demonstrate that it leads to a contradiction and therefore must be false.  As there are only two possibilities (that the number in question is irrational, or that it is rational) disproving one is equivalent to proving the other.  

Whee!"

"event","'Tis that season once again, my friends.  Time to slip on the novelty Union Jack executioner masks, buy a rasberry ripple and watch the gaity of Celebrity Executions 2004.

This year's rundown:

1.  Paul Morley 

Method of execution:  Stabbed in the abdomen and left to bleed to death whilst waiting for a pedestrian with a speech impediment to finish stammering out to the emergency services over the phone the details of what's happened.  His final moments of reflection upon his now concluding life will be repeatedly interrupted by a crowd of sixty talking pigs who will be wobbling their jowels in his face and squealing ""not convincing!  Not convincing!  Leaves me cold!"" whilst looking at each other with self-conscious smugness at the insightful nature of their comments.  The ""Final moment"" will be marked by the pedestrian turning to Paul and saying, with an apologetic and embarrassed smile, ""Sorry, I hadn't even noticed that my phone wasn't switched on!"".

2.  Janet Street-Porter

Method of Execution:  Pecked to death by rooks after a farmer has extracted her teeth with shovel rammed repeatedly into her face for walking accross one of his fields, and then forced her to eat them.  With every shrill scream she issues, yet more rooks will be attracted to the scene thanks to the similarity of her voice and the cawing of opportunistic skyrats.  Once dead, a promising young British artist will display her remains in the Tate Modern under the title ""Country Life (not so great) no. 6"".

3.  Alan Davies

Method of Execution:  Alan will have his massive mong tongue cut out and will be beaten with it whilst he's forced to stuff rocks into his permanently gawping mouth breather face.  Once his mouth is so full to the point where he can barely breath, never mind relentlessly abuse the nation with sub-adolescent zaniness, his rock stuffed head, and a concrete bust of his idol, John Lennon shall be used in a game of conkers that invariably results in Alan's skull popping like a balloon filled with pig entrails."

Buffy Summers
36% amorality, 72% passion, 45% spirituality, 81% selflessness
Well, what can one say? Passionate, down-to-earth, unfailingly moral (ehh, basically) and utterly selfless."

Finalising plans about London - will send out mass email at some point as well as planning for GOA!!!!! woo hoo. 

My well of creativity has dried up due to the absence of my fellow puppet masters - JM therefore -

"event","Two weeks of term left! Feeling rather overworked as usual and wanting to go home but not wanting to go home at the same time. Would like to stop the world for 24 hours to catch up on sleep. Have exams in two weeks and need to pass - however they're on stats which i hate beyond all belief. Failing would be ironic as I have a Mathmo for a boyfreind.

This is a fairly pathetic post but hopefully it'll maken abbagura happy. Honestly, the things i do for you!"

"event","Actually I don't think Snape's evil.  That's ridiculous - I was just disturbed by the high percentages for the characters that are popularly regarded as evil.

Life's good here in the 'Bridge. It's freezing but getting warmer and Steph coming to stay on the 18th which should be great."

"event","Just to keep Annahita happy - here is my first post. Had fairly boring
day - working and talking to friends. Hate the lower limb - who really
needs it. Why does it have so many muscles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Horribly
cold here in the 'Bridge and my windows let the breeze in which is
quite frankly rubbish.<br>
<br>
Did the quiz to find out which Harry potter character I am - 90% Harry,
85% Draco and Lupin, 70% Snape and Sirius and 35% Lord Voldemort. Many
many contrasts which I think sums me up, although there appears to be a
high proportion of evil charcters present and while I may be tactless
and appear to have a heart of stone - I think I'm a nice person
really?!?<br>"

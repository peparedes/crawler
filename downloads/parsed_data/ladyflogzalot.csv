I'm teaching one class this summer but my big project is my DVD.  Lots of work, lots of details, I had no idea.  Writing, filming and then the editing.  That's what takes every minute of my time.  I still have to carve out family time also.  Austin has even more activities in the summer than during the school year. 

To digress to the stupid.  I'm addicted to that dance contest show.  So You Think You Can Dance.  It's fascinating to see the dancers work with the choreographers, luck of the draw what dances they do.  I think the ball room routines are definitely the hardest.  Really hard to pick up a discipline that you have no training in.

I don't know if I'll be able to keep up with this or not.  Ta ta."

     Austin has off from school for President's Week and I have to work so he's going to stay with his grandparents part of the time and with his dad part of the time.  I will miss him but I'll get a lot done while he's gone.  I have a lot of work to do around the house in addtition to working on my show.  
     I have an assistant choreographer, a student, who is so talented.  Darcy can dance, but more than that, she has a phenomenal memory and she has a way with people.  A great help to me.

I had a date (very demure) with another faculty member.  We went to see Mamma Mia.  It was kind of a silly show but we had fun with it.  Everyone in the audience was bopping along.  Funny.

She believes that there is a market for something like this.  Some money to be made.  I was very pleased by her comments.  Everyone here has been great.  

We spent the day with my sister and her family.  Austin had a great time with his cousins. Brad is a year older and Tim is two years younger.  They made quite a trio of troublemakers.

He's doing well now but he needed a lot of help in the beginning.  The thing he has going for him is that he has the personality of an athlete.  His physical therapist tells him to do XYZ and he will do it, no matter what.  He is also an incredibly optimistic person and that helps with rehab.  Yay Dad!  2.  This is an unusual story, but a sort of friend of mine had quads.  (She is definitely a close friend now.)   The babies were all healthy, thank God, but I am one of the volunteers to help her.  I spend 3 hours there every day except Tues and Wed.  The job takes dedication as far as getting there on time every day, but once I am there, it is just fun.  The babies are so cute.  I love it.  I also do some cooking for her; I cook at home and then bring it over for her to reheat.  Caitie is feeling good now and not so overwhelmed but our team has decided to keep up our volunteering for the time being.  She is a lovely person and very grateful shich makes us want to help her. 

Otherwise, things are great.  Austin loves his first grade class.  He reads well already so the teacher gives him extra attention, choosing books for him and discussing them.  I think he helps out with the other kids which is good for him.  Now we are planning his Halloween costume.  The school requires that it be a character from a book.  He wants to be Ron Weasley.

There's a really cool divorced father there on Tuesdays, his day.  We've been having a lot of fun joking around while watching the kids with our eagle eyes.  He has a 6 year-old girl and she and Austin get along.  Next Tuesday, we plan to take the kids to Louie's for lunch.  This guy is the most attractive man I've met in a ling time.  He runs a detective agency, of all things. Works a lot of strange hours, nights and weekends, whenever he needs to.

Austin is going to day camp, starting after the 4th.  

I'm going for scuba diving lessons, something I've always wanted to do."

"event","I love summer.  I'm taking a lot of dance classes and pilates.  Riding my bike, gardening.  Things that I love but have no time for when I'm running my school.  Summer session starts after the 4th of July and then I have to go back to work world.  

My ex is giving me a hard time about Austin's plans for the summer.  A. really wants to go to the Y day camp and then he's going with me to New Jersey at the end of August.  My ex really doesn't want to have him all the time but he acts as if he does just to aggravate me.  Saying he can't go to camp and then away.  I may just call his bluff and tell him he can have Austin for the summer.  I know he doesn't want that.  Leaves him no time to do his own form of goofing around.

Steffie wants me to go out with her on Thursday.  Has another one of her ""exciting guys"" for me to meet.  I don't know.  The last time I met a bunch of her ""guys"" (in a group no less) they failed to impress me.  Too full of themselves.  Where did humility go?"

We closed down the town (not really that late considering the town we're in) and then went over to Steffie's and watched some stupid zombie movie, a real slumber party just like junior high.  I didn't grow up with these girls, except for Allison, but it feels like it.  

Had the whole day to myself and I did a lot of puttering and reading.  This is the life.

Tomorrow is Austin's day.  We're taking a bike ride and picnic with two of his friends.  It will be great.  Ah, summer."

First some lazing around and then a trip to California to visit friends.  Then... I have to plan the rest of my summer.  Summertime, and the living is easy.

Austin has only next week of school left.  He will be at his grandparents most of the time because they have a pool and his cousins will be there.  I don't mind babysitting at all as long as I am poolside.  Little kids look so cute in their suits, running all around.  I love it.

And Monday night is another girls' night out with my friends.  Whoopee!!"

Saw The Day After Tomorrow, a stock disaster flick.  ""Them special effects was fantastic.""  Quite improbable.  It started out with a very improbable event.  These guys had some tents and equipment in Antartica.  There was a rumbling and a split in the ice (a chunk the size of Rhode Island broke off) and lo and behold, the crack went right in between their two tents.  What are the chances?  

Ah, but the new Harry Potter is coming."

Funny, I read something interesting on someone else's livejournal and when I wrote a comment (friendly comment) was rejected.  Again I'll say that I don't understand people having a journal on the internet which is out there for all to see and then guarding it.  What are they afraid of?  No one is coming to your house with an ax.  Oh well,  that's just me.

Recital next weekend.  Then I can live again.  This task gets bigger and more involved every year.

Memorial Day will be the big gigantic picnic with my parents and everyone's friends and relatives.  I'm cooking all day Sunday.  Baking a lot of desserts plus sides, potato salad, macaroni salad, salad salad.  We always have a lot of fun and people come out of whom we haven't seem for a year or more.  Good times."

I plan to move in Dec., start work in Feb, 05.  I have some very good friends in the area, and two family members, so I will have support (emotional, I can take care of my own financial support thank you).  I think I will be very happy  there.  There are a lot of things to do, the twon is lovely and the schools are good.  I will go house-hunting in the fall.  This will be a whole new start for me and for Austin.  I think I made the right decision.

My recital gets closer.  The kids are ready.  I have three real stars this year.  I've done some very interesting choreography with the older girls.  I think the audience will be amazed.  This will not be the typical dancing school recital but then my recitals never are.  I try to approach it as a choreographer would.  Not cutesy-pie.

I was talking to Austin about dinosaurs.  How there were no people alive when the dinosaurs were on the earth.  If you see a movie with people and dinosaurs together, it isn't real.  I asked him if there were any people living when the dinosours were on earth, and he said, ""No, we were extinct."""

I want to wear it every day.  Then I had to buy a great pair of shoes also.  I'll try out the outfit next weekend if it's warm enough.

Just watched the Preakness.  Smartie Jones.  What a cute little fast horse.  I hope he wins the Belmont too.

I'm reading through all my Jane Austen again.  I have to do this about once a year.  I've read Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion, this week.  Next is Sense and Sensibility.  Then I'll read Emma and then Mansfield Park.  I don't like Northanger Abbey; it's dumb."

Austin has to do a little ""experiment"", putting flowers in food coloring so they will turn colors.  Wow, the science fair starts early in schools now.  I got 3 white carnations and a bunch of white dogwood.  We'll have fun.

I'm going to New Jersey next weekend just to visit friends and explore.  And meet a friend of a friend.  A girl can hope.  

I put all my boots away, including my beat-up cowboy boots.  It will be sandals and sneakers until next fall.  My feet say. ""Hooray!"""

"event","I read a piece on someone's journal about friends and friending and unfriending.  I guess I'm completely out of the loop.  I can't see why you keep a journal on the internet unless you want people to read it just for the novelty of the thing.  It is the internet after all.  I have had my own personal journal for many years.  Some of it handwritten and some written on the computer.  That's just for me.  This livejournal thing is supposed to be out in the open.  That's what I think anyway.  I am paranoid about certain people but I can disguise names I think.  No way I could hurt anyone.  My privacy is that no one that I don't want to know, knows that I'm here.  

It is great fun to read other journals.  A peek into other people's lives."

My night out with the girls was a hoot.  We got all dressed up and went bar-hopping.  Danced with everyone, short and tall, cute and ugly.  Got lots of drinks for free.  The last place we hit, we had to run for the car because these two crazy brothers were after us.  Wanted us to came back to the apartment where they had a card game going on to surprise ""all the guys.""  They wouldn't take no for an answer.  I don't think I have laughed that much in a long time.  Two of my friends stayed over with me, a slumber party.  They stayed with me till Friday.  

We watched the last Friends and cried over our popcorn.  I feel as if I've grown up with that show.  I was in college when it started.  I don't think I've missed a show. I always tape it.  Thursdays won't be the same."

Now, I'm back at work.  My recital is May 22.  I have so much to do.  I am an organized person and I have a lot of help but the details still have to be attended to.  My kids and their parents deserve the best.

I'm speaking at Career Day at Austin's school and a few of my girls are performing for the assembly part of the day.  Another thing to plan but it will be fun.  

Now I'm going out to enjoy the weather."

Sad news.  I volunteer at a nursing home every Wednesday afternoon.  Just visiting with people and filling water pitchers, things like that.  I found out that one of my favorites, Mrs. Corcoran, died last night.  She really didn't seem weaker or anything when I spoke with her.  I will miss her smiling face.  She was always so interested in every bit of news I could give her.  She also loved gossiping about celebrities, always watched shows like Extra.

Tomorrow, we're going to visit a friend who has kids and ponies.  The best treat."

Big decision.  I'm definitely moving before next January.  To New Jersey.  I'm familiar with Jersey because I lived there during my younger teenage years.  I'll be close to NYC, able to go in easily to theater and dance performances.  I think I will love my new job.  Now I have to start working on all the details of this move.  I want to buy a small house or townhouse right away.  No renting.  So I'll be doing a lot of traveling to set things up.

Exciting.  Change is something I really need at this point in my life.  I want to start fresh, meet new people.  And I think Austin will love this town.  Schools are great.  Wow, I'm really doing it."

Likes to make his own decisions.  He is flexible too about staying with his dad, with my parents when he needs to.  I think he seees himself as much older than he really is.  He expects adults to treat him as someone with thoughts and opinions and they usually do.

He loves going to the library and choosing his own books to read.  He copies down the title of each book he reads in a composition book.  Very organized guy."

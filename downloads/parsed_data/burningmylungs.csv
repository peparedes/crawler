IM bored, and im in the hotel room and we have a t-3 connection... kudos who knows what that is. Ha ha, today was that day of waiting man, it took us an hour to wait to get over the damn border for canada. Then it took another hour through the damn traffic, then it took an hour to wait in line for a restaurant thatcosted 200$ for about 3 oz of freaking fish, ya the prices wernt even close to the thing, we had no idea. bUT ITS IN CANADIEN MONEY SO ITS not that bad... god damn i hate this laptop because the caPS is exactly net to the freaking a. Ok movement of eent in the last few days man. Took plane ride to seattle from minneapolis after getting out of school, mua ha ha, even thought the classes i went to had all the freaking important stuff in um. i mean, what the hell, its like getting out of school on a feild trip.  Ok, ive grown in a while, its not cool sitting on an airplane with spread eagle. Not fun. tHOSE seats are damn small. Ok we got to seattle and we went to the hotel, then we ate a dinner that cost 100 dollars. WTF IS WITH THE MONEY FLOW JEESUS CHRIST. Oh well its my moms b-day, and my dads paying for it. ha ha. We slept, then the next day we toured the campus of university of washington. it was a cool campus, but the cool part was driving through a neighborhood with homes averaging 4 million dollars each. Ya i would hate to spend my money like that. Im talking to parents right now and they're wondering why im typing on the internet ha ha IM A LOSER. im missing people... its sad. ha ha ha. U know whats a great movie? beverly hills ninja, also watching that right now. Ok after driving through expensive neighborhood we drove to vanceuver. Then the waiting comensed.

It was halarious cuz shes christain and i was roastin on christ... it was halarious. OK im really bored, hence the typing of im really bored. Has anyone seen resident evil? its crazy funny, the chicks all quiet, then kills everyone, its hlarious. Did anyone else know that when u mixed K2SO4 with Potassium Permanganate (dont know chemical compound) you can melt metal but will do very little harm to ur skin? its crazy, and awesome. I realized i like chemistry a     -load more than i like physics because physics are about random everyday things. I feel like making some kind of bomb right now... im that bored, and in that kind of mood. I think ill make an easter-like bomb... ya.. easter-like

TODAY KICKED ASS!!! it was awesome, nate and josh came over to work on the damn acting company, and sula couldnt come...; though id say thats not actually a bad thing because then she and josh would be making out the whole time4 and nothing would get done. Ya, so we finished, i kicked nathans ass in madden. he left crying (oh ya) then me and josh chilled for a few hours working on our song and new songs... it kicked ass.

"event","Hey look, kyle is finally deciding to journal, i know its crazy, and i dont know why im doing it but hey, why the fuck not. Ok, I just watched the butterfly effect (damn good movie), and its the first fucking time in years that ive almost cried in a movie. The thing was beautiful... yes, i realize im gay, but thats not the point. The point is, i started thinkin, and damn us humans are fucked up, i mean, emotions have so many freaking ways to work, like love, hate,  
emotions that to any other creature, would be controlled by. Humans let their emotions get to them so much, that the emotions controll us. The only way someone could hate, is by thinking, the only way someone could love is by thinking, our minds are fucking us over as we speak. We MURDER people, because we fucking think, u know why most animals dont buy a piece of metal, and fire 24 rounds into a fucking bunch of kids, because they think abt one thing, and only one thing. SURVIVAL. And the only amount of thinking that someone needs, is to live.... ya... anyway... deep thinkink with kyle eh?

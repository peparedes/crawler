"event","this morning on the way to school i was driving down my street when i saw a blur run under my car and i felt two thumps. ""fuck i ran over a squirrell"" i thought as i continued halfway down that block. then i thought ""what if it was a cat"" i put the car in reverse and went back to the top of the block. 
i killed a beautiful calico nammed mille this morning.
i took the collar and called the number on it after i moved her out of the street and layed her on the grass. the man i called came out of his house with his shirt on backwards and inside out obviously just out of bed. i lost it and started to bawling, my cat died the same way 4 years ago but the person never called me. after that i just went to starbucks and sat for a while until my dad came there.
ive felt rotten all day and when i got home i almost vomited when i saw cat furr all along the bottom of the car near the rear wheel. 
i feel very disturbed."

His parents are not allowing me, alan, or mitchell to go. all i can say is that im envious. i envy everyone who gets to see him while i am forbidden becuase apparently he is not allowed to see friends that arnt sober. those who are going (as well as his parents) obviously have a skewed deffinition of sober.

i saw him yesterday skate boarding on the street as mitchell and i drove past. we pulled up and said hi. he told us to get the hell away from him. he said to omar he just doesnt want to get in trouble because he doesnt want to go back to utah. i understand."

3 weeks ago the rear passenger door broke off. Again.
2 weeks ago the door frame came off the door and attached to the car when the door was closed.
Last week the circuts almost got fried cuz i left the door open while it was rianing.
On saturday morning when i went to get somthing out of my car there was a pool of water at the bottom. I have no clue how it got there but its still drying.
In the past few weeks ive bumped it a few times too. slow bumps nothing major.

"event","I woke up at 5:55 this morning. My dad came into my room at 5:58 and told me that i was downstairs by 6:30 he would reinstate my car insurence next week. I showered and was down at 6:25. I ate some yogurt for breakfast while my dad told me again about this calander he is now making me keep. It basicly tells him what ill be doing for every hour of every day for the rest of the month. He disagreed with my counselor that this was an aggresive request of me and then fired him claiming to have a moral dispute with him over the financing of my counseling sessions. So i agreed to do this calander becuase there was no reason to stand up for myself. Its not like i have anything anyways. 

Today he told me im not allowed to disrespect him. I told him that this was a resonable request but its not fair to punish me becuase he disrespects me and that its a 2 way street. He then went on to say it didnt matter his treatment of me because we are not equals. 

I wish he'd hit me so badly becuase i want an excuse to just go nuts. I find myself wanting to rip things off the walls and break things within reach when im talking to him. 

I feel him prying into me in so many ways. 

Yesterday i had SAT class at crossroads. He showed up to pick me and my friends a half hour early, even though i told him what time to pick me up. When the class was over he was unpleasent to my friends because they were ""taking to long"" to get to the car. His nerves are absolutely shot. We went to get gas afterwards and he screamed at me becuase i suggested which pump he use.

i know i fucked up but i didnt fuck up bad enough to deserve him as a father. You dont get to choose your parents. I really wish hed hit me.

"event","i feel like writing because i feel bad. 
im not sure what to say or even how to say it; and then even if i do say anything what am i even trying to accomplish. I guess im pretty pessimistic right now because things that are supposed to make me happy don't anymore. i hope this is just a phase, i dont even know if its a phase because looking back it seems as if things were always like this, just maybe not this bad."

"event","So as i stand in line at the Slice to get my two pieces of peperoni (i had 4 slices of pizza today: 1 for lunch, 1 after school, and 2 for dinner) a man in front of me buys $21.50 of food at the slice. He payed with two dollar bills. He had a fresh stack of them bound in the loops that are only put on money at the U.S. Mints. This ream of Jeffersons had 100 bills ($200) as its loop stated. I inquired about this oddity. He gets 200 bucks in 2s every 2 weeks from this lady he knows at the bank. He likes to give them to homeless people. Thats so fucking tight. I would love to pay for everything with 2 dollar bills. He tiped the guy 4 bucks. I payed with a 20 and got my change in 2's because when i grow up, im going to pay for everything with 2 dollar bills just like that guy.

"event","so. Friday night, like an idiot i signed up to photograph the game again. It was fun but i couldn't enjoy it from the stands, i had to be on the side line with the crazy photographer from the santa monica mirror who wouldn't stop shouting ""i love american football"". She claimed to be addicted to chewing gum.

I also got my tires checked out because i've driven about 50,000 on the ones i have right now. Andrea (my step mom) is so cheap, she had the ford explorer with those faulty firestones but instead of getting new ones she risked her life for 3 months while she waited on a waiting list to get free ones from the dealership. Those free tires are the ones we have now. So the guy said you have a lot of life on them, but its wierd because even if i go through the smallest of puddles i hydroplane, i guess thats kinda tight.

Mr. Flanders is alright but i dont like his assignments. Its like ever class period im matching my smarts against his. 
Flanders: There are 26 ammendments to our constitution
Max:no theres 27
...
Flanders: The New Jersey plan called for a stronger central government
Max: No, the New Jersey plan called for a Unicameral legislature in which each state had one vote no matter its size, thats why the great comprimise includes a bicameral legislature.
Flanders: Fair enough. Get on your bike.

Our wait yesterday was soo boring. I got cigarett coke on my shirt when i kicked that bottle. I broke a snapple bottle. we went to some wierd house where the parents were down and the Persian faction had invaded. When we left we came across anthony again who had gotten lost. Damn. funny drunk girls, ""Lick it off me!"".

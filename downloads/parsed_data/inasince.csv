"event","I just got back from UDA camp.  We did a lot better than expected.  We got a lot of Blue ribbons (1-3 mistakes in the dances you learned) and more Reds (3-5 mistakes) than we'd like.  The girls that got reds where SO upset. . . This was my LAST camp THANK GOD!  I'm not a good learn a dance in a hour perfrom it the next day kinda person.  I did however have to try out for ""All-Stars"" this year.  For All Stars you learn 2 8counts of jazz, 2 8counts of hip hop, and 2 8counts of pom, then make up 2 of your own 8counts.  Well I did it.  I went out there kinda messed up but didnt freeze was sharp smiled. . . . I was VERY happy with my performance.  But I did not get All-Stars. . . not that I expected that I would get it but it would have been nice. . . To be able to say LOOK I CAN DO SOMETHIGN GOOD!!!  6 girls tried out for all stars from bossier. . . 12 from the camp. . . they took I think 6 or 7 girls. . . Everyone from Bossier got it except me. . . Needless to say I was heart broken. . . It was SO hard not to cry.  At the end Chels started crying cuz it was her last year and I went ahead and cried and let everyone think I was crying because I was sad it was our last camp.  Yeah right! lol I hate camp.  But since I'm an officer I was invited to go to the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade in New York.  I can't wait to do that!  It cost around $2000.  PLUS spending money!  Fun times huh.  But we got 2nd place for our hometown rouine!  Very VERY good!  hehe Plus we got drill down CHAMPS and A Superer Throphy and uhmmm spirt stick and the ""on the ball award""  which is basically a beach ball! lol  Well I'm very tired.  More camp detail  lata."

Then after carl and ms rose went to thomas's wake, they came pick me up to go see the passion of the crist.  it was so good and I didnt cry until he resureted.  that got me.  I go to hear all the old ""baby ferrell"" stories.  I love when ms rose tells me about em.  lol  shes so freakin cool. one time when carl was like 5 ms rose would always go do her errands on fridays and one friday carl didnt wanna go and he was like why and ms rose said cuz I gotta run errands.  about half way through her errands carl asked ""Wheres arrands?""  lol  And charles asked his mommy how they got babies and she said well when a man and a woman love each other they get married and have babies.  Then about a week later charles asked ""Mommy, can you and daddy get married again so I can have a baby sister?""  lol Theres more but yeah
friday and sat I just worked
sunday  Carl came to church with me!  It was so much fun and he liked it a lot.  He doesnt go to church much but I think its cuz he doesnt have anyone to go with.  His mum is cathloic like me but he isnt.  Then we went out to eat at wendys.  then I got called into work.  lol

I knew him from when we where in band and as poogies boyfriend and then ex-boyfriend.  He was always nice and polite towards me and my grandparents.  Carl grew up with the caldwells.  I work with mrs. caldwell in the concession stand.  She is by far one of the sweetest ladies I know.  And now that hes gone I just wonder how shes taking it.  His wake is tomorrow.  Carls going but I just dont know if I could go. . . I dont know if I could handle that.  He shot poogie too.  In her leg.  I've heard a lot of rumors why but only 2 people know why.  Him and her.  I might go see the Pasion of the Crist tomorrow with Carl and his Mom. . . Everythings very confussing.  All this happened yesterday but I didnt want to write unless I knew it wass true.  I just hope that everyone will pray for the caldwells. . . pray for thomas. . .  Only great hurt could have lead to that. . . Melody and I went out to eat at Gators today.  We talked about this and danceline and sum fundrasier ideas that her and I want to do.  Well I'm just waiting for carl to get off work."

Thursday- I worked.  Uhhh I think I ran pizzas bussed tables and did kid check and I had to close the whole showroom which is HUGE.
Friday-  Went to dance clinic and then i went home fought with my gpa and as sad as this may sound went on my first ""car date"".  Carl came pick me up we went saw 50 First Dates (it was so awesome!  I wanted to cry and laugh at the same time! Must see!) then he drove me home.  We had so much fun.  And normally I get kinda nervous being in cars with teens but I felt totally safe.  
Sat-  Got my hair cut then just chilled until I had to go to work.  That was the longest work day EVER for me.  I bused tables then kid check.  Then cleaned the balcony.  Its hard to get smushed crackers out of carpet under booths.
Sun-  Church then work.  I did merchindise.  Then I closed for this other chick.  All I had to do was clean the bevrage bar and vaccum kid check and sweep a lil.  No biggie.  But it was our manger Mikes bday.  So we told him sumthing was wrong with the show then got him out there and told him happy birthday and had a cake out for him.  There was 36 candles on it so it started melting the lil sign so he blew out the candles.  Then this guy names Kyle took all the candles off really fast and he smashed it in mikes face.  Mike took the cake off his face and kyle took off running and mike just threw it and it hit the bevreage bar.  Then later on mike got sum cake pushed it in kyles face, put him in a trash can and rolled him outside.  It was too funny.  I didnt see the second half cuz I was workin but kyle told me and I saw polaroids on the board.  lol  Then kyle got cake all over my pants.  the nerd.
today is monday!
today was boring and I got dance clinic later."

I cried the whole time I was writing.  Theres so much I wish I could change about myself.  Its just so hard to really DO it.  For one thing I'm getting way to posseive over carl.  I dont know why but everytime he like has to go talk to someone I just get really sad and he can tell or sumthing and he wont go but I dont want him to lose friends because of me.  I just HATE it.  Then I wanted to invite him out to the movies tonight but he was going to fix up the truck with his mom.

Then he prances in my room while I'm getting ready acting like nothing ever happened and its just a WONDERFUL day. . . I just didnt say anything except when he asked me stuff.  Even then I jsut gave short answers.  Then I get to school and it seems like people just WANTED to push my buttons by saying rude things to me about people I happen to care about. . . Its like she didnt even notice she was offending me. . .  I hate rude people!  Second hour my nose was like so clogged and I couldnt breathe so I went and called my gma and asked her to bring me sum med.  In bio I spilled sum dye on my hands and Coach Kopean said it'll prolly take like 3 days for it to come off!!!  But I think its gotten lighter.  It looks like a diesase.  :-(  Then I went to Chuck E Cheese after school and the manger told me that they wherent going to hire for a couple weeks.  But then he'd call me.  I got a BYL application so I'll see how that goes.  I came home an tried to take a nap butmy dogs kept barking and then carl called so no nap.

I watched the guys play both games Saturday and they could have one both.  They played Loyola and Minden and lost both by just one point that was scored in the last ending (wow I'm learning baseball!).  Carl played SO good in the second game.  I sat with his mommy most of the time.  I was surprised to see her!  It was cool.  lol  She hugged me most of the night calling me ""Laurns replacement"".

As carl said my gma doesnt need his crap.  Neither do I.  Its depressing.  He holds me back from so much.  He tells me to do what makes me happy then wont let me do anything I want too.  He wont let me have a normal teenage life!!!  Its so frustrating!!!  I do EVERYTHIGN he wants then I cant do anything I want!!!!  These are the best years of my life and I hate them!!!!! I just wish he would leave once and for all so my grandma and I can be happy.  Thats all I want is to be happy but thats just to much to ask nowadays.  My grandma and Carl make me happy and thats it. . .  But guess who jumps in. . . GRANDPA!"

But today was really just an east day.  Coach Kopean wasnt at skool my hour but wrote a note to me to grade sum papers for him.  We where suppose to be watching sum movie but Gerald, Tommi, Ali, Fields, Joey, and I all sat in the back and talked.  Ali, Gerald, and Fields got a bouncy ball and coach's fish net things (ya know the things you get the fish out the water with?) and played lacrosse.  It was really funny.  Then I tried to learn how to play Zelda on Fields game boy thingie.  Right as I was getting to the good part we had to go to lunch.  Right as I walked outside carl was there and we walked over to where we stand for lunch.  It sucked though cuz Mr Sampson kept walking by.  No fun today. Whew I've been sneexing all day.  lol Like those big head flies forward sneezes.  Ugh I just saw the new good charlotte video and they look really preppy now.

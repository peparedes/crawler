"event","I just can't be critical of other people's decisions and resulting actions. Even if they're doing something that I believe in my heart is wrong. Why? ..I'm not entirely sure why. Maybe because I'm so critical of myself sometimes. Whenever I think about saying something critical, I take it, point it at myself, and wonder if maybe I'm the one who is wrong. And more often than not in most cases, I know me saying something will just make the other person upset or pissed off. I hate causing undue duress to people. I worry too much about others and not enough about myself sometimes. It's good to be selfless every once in a while, but not to the exclusion of your own happiness. But I just can't seem to do that for myself. It's so frustrating.

I just want to pull my hair out and scream, sometimes. I want to make myself happy, and not have it be dependent upon others' happiness. But..I just can't do it."

I need a girlfriend. A relationship. Something to give my life more meaning than it has. I just feel like all I'm doing is preparing for ""life"" aka having a job and ""living"" all alone.

At least I have a roommate right now. But what about after I graduate, or if he decides to move out once our lease is up this year? I get little-to-none human contact as it is. Maybe I should get rid of my computer.

Nah..then I'd go insane instead of just being depressed. I dunno..that might actually be better. At least insane people are oblivious. Then I wouldn't realize how pointless my life has become.

Maybe getting a job will help make things better..then I'd have something to do, and be out in public and away from my computer more often. We'll see. I'll be getting one within a month or so.

Anyhow..I guess that's enough rambling for the night. I'm gonna sleep, and hope that tomorrow is a brighter day."

"event","Today was crazy..I spent practically the entire day in my car sans a couple hours eating lunch and dinner. I took my cousin, who is visiting from Georgia, out to meet an online friend of hers who lives in eastern Washington.

So you gotta understand a few things..there are two freeways which go east and west alongside the Columbia River. SR-14 goes along the Washington side, and I-84 is on the Oregon side.

So we went east on 84, and suddenly all the traffic is at a virtual standstill, and there's all this smoke and ash falling on my car. Apparently there was this hugeass fire right next to the highway, and they were diverting all the traffic off 84 via an offramp, and two lanes of highway were being forcefully merged onto it. Needless to say, it took about 40 minutes to crawl about a mile to this offramp. And as luck would have it, as we were getting off, about to cross a bridge over to the Washington side, one of the DOT guys stops us and says we have to turn back the other way..so my mom had to plead our case and we, along with maybe two other cars, were the last ones allowed to cross before all that traffic was turned around. Man was my cousin happy.

So we finally get to the meeting place for lunch, and my cousin goes off with the people we met, and my mom and I need to head home. Only problem is, we can't go west on 84 because of the fire, and we can't go on 14 either because there was a large vehicle accident along the highway in that direction. So we end up having to take this longass route AROUND fucking Mt. Hood, and end up getting to my mom's work two hours later. From there it was a half hour drive to meet my dad and bro for dinner, then home to pick up some things, and a half hour drive home to the apartment.

God this was a long day.

I love my new bed."

"event","I just feel the need to rant..been a long time since I've posted and I have a lot on my mind because of my stupid medication allowing me to concentrate on all my problems. Making myself depressed for crying out loud.

All I can think about are my girl woes. For some reason I've got myself thinking that I'm never going to get into a good healthy relationship with someone who actually lives near me. Whenever I'm attracted to a girl, like at college or some such, I just shut off. No smiling..no flirting..like I don't want to start something...but I DO! I've got such a big goddamn fear of rejection that I just turn off and don't even allow for the possibility of getting to that point with a girl that she'll even have a chance to. WTF is wrong with me??

I also have this unhealthy propensity for becoming interested in girls I meet on the net who live too far away for the possibility of a relationship. So I avoid getting rejected by girls whom I might be able to have a relationship with, but for some reason I'm perfectly willing to get my hopes up with girls I have no chance with whatsoever, and let those hopes get dashed to pieces like my heart has so many times in the past. You'd think I enjoyed rejection and heartache. Like I've ever known anything else..

"event","So..a sad thing happened recently at our house. We had to put down the family cat, Beejay. 

He had been sick for the past year or so, his kidneys were failing on him. He would throw up if he ate any kind of food with protein, and we had to start feeding him a special diet. But his health and his body weight slowly declined, and I knew this day was coming for a while..thankfully. My parents let me spend a half hour with him alone before they left for the vet to make the final decision, but they were pretty sure at that point what was going to happen. I got my closure, and I'm very thankful for that.
I try not to think about it..cos every time I do, I feel a swell of tears..and I always get depressed when I cry.

He's been with us for 13 years, and he was the best house cat you could possibly ask for. If you were sick, he'd sleep with you. If you were sad, he'd sit on your lap and purr. If you just wanted company, he was there. He loved attention, and people were his favorite source. It would be impossible for me to express how much he meant to our family..and we have suffered a great loss at his death. He always acted like a kitten, even up until his last years. Always willing to play with string, rubber bands, or even fingers wiggling playfully around a corner. I've known him for more than half of my natural life - I was raised with him around the house. There's a large vacancy where my heart used to be..

I want my cat back :( I miss you Beejay."

"event","Alright, I'm gonna rant. I have a problem with this word. ""cute"" is so overused, and I'm getting sick of it.
Personally, I think it is a code word for girls. When she tells you your cute..the translation is basically this: ""I like you and think you're a really great guy, but I wouldn't date you if you were the last man on Earth. And I can't tell you why.""
Almost every girl I've met in the past has said that I am ""cute"". Even girls that hardly know me or have just met me, almost invariably make that comment. But I know that none of them would ever be interested in a relationship with me. So what's the deal with that?
At a renaissance faire this weekend, I saw someone that I got kind of tipsy with, for my first time. She was at faire with a couple of her girl friends, and she was telling them how I was so ""cute"" the first time I got a little tipsy. This immediately sent a signal to all of em, I swear.

I am NOT cute! I am a manly STUD!!!

Okay, so I have virtually infinit space, but still. I don't feel like typing that much. =/

Anyhow, I spent last weekend up in Gig Harbor at a renaissance faire..it was a ton of fun! I got to play the King of Scotland (well actually, the husband of the Queen of Scotland, but my character likes to believe he's the King, hehe) and he is a rather colorful fellow. In history he was quite a womanizer, and he loved to get drunk and act unruly, so needless to say I had a lot of fun with the character. Unfortunately for me though, on Sunday, my wife decided that she'd had just about enough of my foolishness, and she conspired with someone to blow me up! So I died :( Oh well..can't last forever. There's always next year when I get to do it all over again!
Then on the second weekend I got to play a monk..which isn't anything special, really. I still have fun, but not as much fun as when I'm the King. Plus, on Sunday of the second weekend, my allergies finally got the better of the medication that I had been taking. I couldn't hardly breathe, so I had to leave early on Sunday and drive home. :( I missed the murder of the Arch Bishop..but oh well, it was better than staying and suffocating, I suppose.

During the week in between the two weekends at faire I spent the time in Leavenworth at a campground with my family, and enjoyed myself immensely. My friend, my brother, and my brother's friend were all there. One of the nights, we went out with our flashlights and were just walking around, talking and enjoying ourselves. Then we saw a bunch of people on the other side of this field, but since we couldn't see them, we shined our flashlights across at them. Then they got all pissed off, and started chasing us! It was really scary..they sounded drunk, and I ended up tripping and dropping my flashlight and the walkie talkie I had been carrying. Fortunately, they didn't find us, so it was all happy in the end. We eventually talked to the people the next day, and they were still all pissed at us and threatened to beat us up if we ever did it to them again. We never did, though...and the rest of the vacation was uneventful. :(

Yeah..so I'm all done talking now. Read my journal more often!!

I'm starting to get a little bit stressed out. I only have one week left of classes, and we all know what that means...FINALS WEEK. ugh.. And I have a class in computer software design which I need to get a good grade in, but which I didn't even go to at all last week. And I have a Visual Basic class which also has a final project I need to work on and turn in soon. These are just small things in this one big thing.
Next...university after college. I really don't have a good idea of where I am going after I get my associates degree from my community college. I don't think my idea of going to Iowa is going to pan out...I'm thinking of going to University of Washington, but that's really just my safety college..I haven't looked much. And my parents, especially my mom, are breathing down my neck to talk to someone at the school to figure out what classes I have remaining to take so that I can finish my 2-year degree. Which means they're also trying to push me to take classes over the summer..but I really don't want to, because I need a break from school. So that means I need to go find a job..
Lastly..and this is probably the thing that haunts me the most..my old girlfriend is still trying to decide whether she wants to start a serious relationship with me. She keeps giving me all these different signs, so I have no idea what's going on in her head in those regards. One minute she gets pissed off because I invite friends to go with us without telling her, the next she's getting emails from a guy she used to be desperately in love with, and yells at me when I suggest that she try to cut him out of her life, since she says she hates him so much. I honestly don't even know if that's true...but whatever..

Anyhow..I'm just stressed. So to all of my friends out there, forgive me if I seem a bit off for the next couple of weeks.

The girl that I really like who lives in Alabama has recently decided she's going to avoid me:( I don't know why..I've tried apologizing to her for anything I may have done to upset her, but she insists there's nothing wrong. But if there's nothing wrong, why won't she talk to me? :( *hangs his head* I just want to be her friend again..

Okay well so here's the semi-good news. I say semi because I'm not sure if it will end up being really good news, or just something that got my hopes up and dashed them like a ship on a reef. I'm not sure if I've told the story yet, but basically, I fell in love with my senior Prom date back in the day two years ago..after a month of dating. Well, basically, she wouldn't have anything to do with me as far as romantically, but just wanted to be my friend. I was depressed for over a year because she led me on, believing that some day she might decide to try again. I finally got over it about a year ago, and we've been steadfast friends ever since. I'm like the closest male friend she has. Anyways..she said she's been thinking for months that she wouldn't mind dating me again! Totally out of the blue..but there's a few problems. I don't want to get hurt again..that would just destroy me..I couldn't go through another year of total depression. So we decided that she needs to figure out whether she really can love me romantically, or if she'll always just think of me as a friend. So basically, now I'm just waiting for her to decide that...so I could either be the happiest guy on the planet sometime soon, or else I'll just go back to being the regular ol' half-depressed ""Bob"" that I was not a couple weeks ago.

When I clicked the button to send the application, the memo I got back said that it sent it at 12:45 AM EST on 5/16. ARGH. I'm going to be so pissed off if they don't accept it because of god damn time zones. It was 5/15 when I sent it..they better take it!!

I WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE!!!!!!

I shouldn't have skipped my computer design class today..the rest of the class was supposed to be presenting their UML stuff today. If I'd gone I would have got a pretty good idea for what I'm going to want to put in my midterm. It's not really a big deal tho, I mean, the teacher isn't being really critical since it's just a midterm and all. But..when I start doing this, putting things off, I have this nasty habit of not doing it. It's due wednesday..I'm gonna have to finish it tomorrow.

Feelin better today about getting upset over that girl I talked about yesterday. I'm still upset, but, I'm not really depressed any more. I guess I'm just resigned to the fact that I'm never going to be with her...hard fact to face. And it sucks like hell. She's such a wonderful person and deserves a good boyfriend. I really hope she finds one..it would help her so much. She just needs to move out of the state where she lives, and find a place with better diversity! Not every guy in the world wants to just fuck. All you nice guys out there - look out. If you run into a red-haired beauty building a movie set..grab her! Don't let go of those nice girls!
But...don't chase the ones that live far away, either..Trying to make long distance relationships work, will drive you insane..trust me.

"event","Okay, so I'm going to lay it out. As anyone can obviously tell, for the past three days or so, I've been an unhappy guy. And I'm sure it's also fairly obvious, that my depression is being triggered by this girl. So here's the story..

Basically, I meet a girl (her name isn't important..) playing my addiction: online MajorMUD. Anyone out there who knows it, knows what I'm talking about. Anyone else, wouldn't understand :P So I meet her and we touch it off pretty fast. I think one of the first things I did was ask her to marry me in the MUD (just for fun, and cos nice girls are hard to find, and cos I'm a priest, so I could make it happen fast before she had time to rethink after saying yes *chuckles*), and she said yes. So we spent quite a bit more time together after that.
So, we got to talk a lot. And I find out that we have very compatible personalities. Unfortunately for me, she lives in Alabama. I live in Washington..
I finally found a girl who I thought I could really love given time, and I can't, cos she lives so damn far away.
The gods are all pitted against me, in this war to see who can make me suffer the most by using women to torture me.
I guess that's the whole story. Didn't seem as long as I thought it was going to be. Probably because I left a ton of the little stupid stuff out that nobody in their right mind would want to read. And anyhow..I doubt I'll be sending anyone to this website anyway. Anyone who reads all this crap about how messed up I am would get totally scared shitless. Maybe I'll just use it to scare people off..heheh.

All I want is a girlfriend..I'm so tired of being lonely all the time. Someone to cheer me up when I'm sad, to hold when I'm happy, to love when I'm lonely. Someone going in the same direction as I am in life, who lives near where I do, who accepts me for me and doesn't care about my faults.
God...looking at all those requirements, I don't think that's ever gonna happen. She doesn't have to be perfect..just loving me would be enough :( Can't even seem to find that though..
Fuck the distance bug..I'm never letting it fucking bite me again. God damn it..why did I have to be born with this innate sense to like those who are unattainable.
I'm moving to Iowa at the end of summer..maybe I'll actually find someone and be happy. I'm tired of being sad and lonely.
All I want is a girl to love and who loves me. It's not a lot to ask for :(

Just when you think you've found the right girl, she always manages to slip out of your hands. Why does life work that way?
Here's a solution..walk around with glue all over your hands. That way, when you find her, she can't get away.

Just make sure you don't kill any kittens in the process..."

So anyhow, yeah. I want a freakin break. I recently managed to find this really great girl. The most important thing about her? SHE PLAYS MUD!! OMG it's a miracle, normal female mudders DO exist! Never lose hope folks. Anyways..yeah, so she's got all this going for her, cept for one thing..she lives in freakin Alabama! COME ON!! This is where breaks in a lifetime of mostly emotional hardships are supposed to occur. Why couldn't she live in Vancouver or something? :P I'm grasping at straws here.

What's worse than liking a girl who lives so far away? Realizing that she likes you back, and not being able to do a god damn thing about it. Knowing you'd both be happier if it could possibly happen. Blegh..I'm trying to make lemonade here, but it's getting really sour without any fucking sugar.

Someone needs to invent a teleporter. I'd pay millions for an invention like that.

On a lighter note..at least tomorrow my parents are going to work my ass off doing spring cleaning. I'll be so tired tomorrow I won't have the energy to even think how frustrated I am about everything. Maybe if I think about how exhausted I'm going to be tomorrow, some of it will rub off and I'll go to sleep tonight worry-free. One can only hope."

I want to find a girl..that's all! It's not too much to ask. They all either get tired of me, or live too damn far away! Maybe I'll just move to the center of the country, that way the furthest away they can be is halfway..instead of the entire distance. *grumbles*

Wonder how long it's gonna take for someone to find this journal and read it..*chuckles*

Gonna be spilling my guts, once a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year!

Hope you all have strong stomachs and stable minds, because this is going to be one hell of a ride..buckle those seatbelts folks!!

Anyways..it's late and my stomach hurts, and I'm TIRED so I'm going to bed. I'll figure out more of the cool stuff I can do on here some other evening when it's 2:30 AM (or not).

"event","So several really cool things to report...

A while back, my mom and stepdad entered my sister Danielle in this make-a-wish foundation contest thing, because my little sister has a trace in her throat, can't talk, etc.  Well, to make a long story short, she won, and that got the entire family an all-expenses paid week-long vacation to I guess it's Disney World/Sea World or something like that.  It's at the end of July, Kelley and I's flights down to NM are even paid for.  So that's good news, it's been literally forever since my family's taken a vacation together, like eight years, I think.  So it'll be good for all of us, I'm looking forward to it.  

I'm at work now after having two days off, which was a lot of fun.  I saw the movie ""Leon"", which is now one of my favorite movies.  I also saw X3, which I have a list of complaints about ten miles long about, but still enjoyed nonetheless.  

Oh yeah, and Derek's coming back to Missouri, mid-to-end of June, so I'll be in St. Louis for at least part of the time."

I saw quite a bit of stuff that I'd never seen in Missouri before, including numerous Missouri tarantulas, scorpions, and at least thirty six-lined racerunners.

Oh yeah, new Tool album.  So I've gotten the chance to absorb it, and I still say with certainty that I love it.  I loved the first two tracks so much that it took me a while to absorb tracks three and four, which are both fairly soft.  Track five is probably my favorite song on the album, the interesting thing on this is the Tool fans that I've talked to that have heard the album (a total of like three), either love this song or hate it.  I can see how it would come across that way.  One track, can't remember the number, think it might be nine, is honestly completely inaudible, something about an alien abduction and a doctor, I think.  Three tracks are complete and total bullshit that shouldn't even be on the album, because all they are are innane noises, but that's really my only complaint.  Oh yeah, and be prepared, because all the songs are REALLY LONG.  Three of the tracks aren't songs, so technically there's only eight songs on the album, and the album itself is almost 90 minutes long.  Oh yeah, and track 10 is great as well.  Will post more in depth once I actually own the album and know the names of the tracks.

"event","For some reason, today I felt a very strong desire to watch the movie ""Luther.""  Dunno if any of you have seen it, but it's worth a watch.  I was brought up in the Lutheran faith, and even though I no longer consider myself Lutheran, I have an infinite amount of respect for the man that Martin Luther was, just because of how incredibly ballsy he was, to take on the church of his day the way that he did pretty much meant a death sentence, yet without Luther, the whole protestant reformation probably never would have happened.  Plus, at the heart of most of what he wrote and said was this incredible battle going on inside of him, a very spiritual war being raised, if you will.  If you look at Luther's life, the guy was kind of a wreck at times.  I can definately relate to the scene in the movie in which he's speaking with his mentor Staipitz, the dialogue goes something like this.  Luther's in this confessional, praying feverishly (that's an understatement, really, he kind of sounds like he's on the verge of madness), and Staipitz comes to comfort him.  Luther asks ""Have you ever dared to think that God is not just?  This righteous judge who creates us, full of sin, then damns us for our faults, threatening us with the fires of hell.  I wish there were no God.""  And Staipitz asks him ""What is it that you seek, Martin?""  Luther responds with ""A merciful God, a God that I can love.""  Staipitz responds with ""Then look to Christ.  Bind yourself to Christ, and you will know God's love.  Say to him 'I am yours, save me.'""  

That's kind of an inner dialogue I've had with myself many times...and that prayer, ""I am yours, save me.""  It's simple, but very powerful, and I've made it kind of a daily part of the prayers that I say.  Anyway, great movie if you haven't seen it, do."

"event","One of my boas just completely laid into me the other day...she's normally really docile, but I guess I caught her on a bad day.  I just reached into her tank to pick her up, and she gave me this look, then BAM, nailed me right under the thumb.  She hung on like a bulldog too, it took some alcohol on the end of a cuetip to get her to let go (Note:  If you're ever bitten by a snake that refuses to let go, this is a neat trick...), which she finally did.  But man...a boa literally has a mouth full of little knives...ouch.

On the other hand, DO see ""Capote.""  I just finished watching it, and it's amazing, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding, and it's just a really incredible story.  I enjoyed it.

It's been a long time since I've had a good crush, wouldn't mind having one again.

Ignore any bad press you've heard about the movie because it's fantastic, probably the best time piece I've ever seen.  Depp is outstanding as John Wilmot, and the opening monologue at the beginning of the film is one of the coolest things I've ever heard.

-------------------------------------
No spot in store
Or capable of
A heart lacking lies
When change is
Dishonesty
Another request with
Lips tied shut by
A murder, a mirage
A folk song's tomb
Veil
Permission to copulate
In graphite and ceremonial
Religion, disbelief
No memory of
Vows
Perhaps her head
Thick with wine
Could not comprehend 
The weight of
Words
The first full thing
She ever spoke
Beyond fault, because
She's no fortune teller
Dishonesty"

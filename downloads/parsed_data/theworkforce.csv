i also heard from meghan, and she said the same thing kinda... but she said im doing well too, and so those were like wake up calls... not really though, i just like talking to good friends that i havent talked to in a long time...

they both know im dying inside though, and so they didnt go into it with me, because the less i talk and think about it, the better i feel... so that was good...

and tomarrow me, brian, and darla are off work, so us and mike and chris are all gonna hang out all day... im excited, because i love those 4 and they are like my best distraction, so i should have a great day tomarrow...

well i guess im off... no one reads this... oh well"

"event","so im getting down on myself again... but im glad that i got my friends back... but yeah... im still not doing very well... i started smoking again, because it does get my mind off her...

this is so fucking strange... like ive been with 3 girls since her already, and but something always wants me to try and get her back, and so yeah i dunno...

i finally get shane... im pretty sure that he's doing what i did to lindsey... where he thinks that he likes her, and he convinces himself that too... and then he just gets tired of her and figures it out that, thats now how it is, and there are no feelings there... but he doesnt want to break her heart and tell her the truth, so he just leaves it alone, and just tries to be nice to her and stuff...

because it seems to me that lindsey is now going through the same thing that leana is going through... and i dunno... its just interesting... and but mike helps alot, and gets my mind off it.. thanks man... true best friend...

well thats all"

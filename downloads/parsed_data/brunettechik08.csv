"event","ya its been a pretty long time since ive updated... let's see... school is pretty tough, but what else would u expect with all the crappy classes im taking? Band is hard... and stressful. Soccer is very tiring lol. We've already gone to like 3 tournaments (Athens, GSA, and some Chick-fil-a tournie) but we havent won ne of them. Hopefully we are getting better tho.... before the real season starts. We had a really tough game yesterday and i was keeper the whole time... ive got tons of bruises all over my legs, and they hurt! and then my stupid knee had to go and pop out of place and back in again... so my mom was freaking out, but everythings ok. a lot of ppl on the team are hurt now, so it sucks. We had our first football game on friday and it was uhh very interesting. the rain made things pretty miserable, but i didnt march too terribly aweful and i did manage to play 90% of the notes... Me and shelly had fun on the bus talking to cristina, eric, aaron, and michelle! it was a somewat interesting experience... So far high school is definitely amazing. Once u get past the long, boring class periods (especially in french and world cultures), its def amazing. Speaking of.... i have two tests tommorrow ahh! french and biology. wonderful. Well it could be awhile before i update again, so yah. have a great rest of august! o yah, homecoming is coming up. No date there.... but i didnt really expect one so its all good rite? rite..... some of my pope friends are going with there dates but im not sure im going to go yet. Its supposed to be really stupid and i could spend the nite catching up on sleep :). im out

"event","<P>.... which means school will be starting soon! <FONT size=4>ahh freshmen</FONT>! somewat scary.. haha completely scary. least the classes are. band was scary until about lunchtime when i finally relaxed. so far band has actually been pretty fun. its awesome to hang out with shelly and cristina and see all the other lovely ppls! all the hard work that we're going to put into it is totally going to be worth it. band has been pretty frustrating, trying to keep up with the upperclassmen. at least most of them are nice :). the drum majors and my section leaders seem pretty cool so hopefully it'll be a good year. we got the opener today and lets just say middle school band does NOT prepare u for high school... so grr mr taylor. he should have been pushing us harder not lecturing us! seems like the mabry kids had it good... and they seemed to understand the music better :(. </P>
<P>neways.... tommorrow i leave for student life camp after band camp! woo hoo! that'll be def exciting, and somewat of a break from band. when i come back early sunday, band camp will be starting. the full band camp which means hey... ill be busy from like 8 am-11 pm every day. last nite i went with megan and cortney to the baseball game which was pretty <FONT size=5>amazing</FONT>. we went down to the field and met leo mazzone!! (braves pitching coach) and he gave me a signed&nbsp; ball from russ ortiz and himself.... wow!! jim thome (hr leader)&nbsp;said hey to me lol. it rocked. and i got pictures and stuff. unfortunately, they lost but the game was still fun. well i better get to packing and practicing my clari.... memorization is like impossible for me. there has to be like this mental block :(....&nbsp;</P>

"event","so today was my last day of babysitting yay! it was fun with the kids, and definitly worth it cause the money, but now my afternoons will be a little bit more free... for awhile! so i made $184 this week and $184 last week so that makes.... $368 if i did my math rite :)! awesome awesome.... and megan comes bak today from cali! of course tommorrow tho i have to babysit for 2 hrs :( b/c my sister has a babysitting job and she needs to get ready for her senior picture. wow. its very scary to me that kelsey's a senior, im a freshmen. its really weird. today i went shopping w/ kelsey and we found lots of stuff at express... and i found stuff at AE. that was cool! so yep, im pretty much satisfied rite now. the only thing that hurts, is the thing that has been hurting for awhile. lost relationships with friends. i havent been able to go to sleep much for a few days, and i think its because ive been reflecting on my old friendships and thinking over so much stuff. i really miss doing all the amazing church stuff this summer too!!! 
o, i almost forgot! yesterday i went to a braves game with mr. kneller, michael, and mitchell. it rocked! we had like amazing seats (even tho they were high up). i had sooo much fun with mr. kneller. he's a cool guy! alrite well i gotta go take my video bak to power video... cya cool kids later!

(near harvard) tho ive got a lot of great stuff going on this summer, i really havent done much with ne of my friends. isnt that supposed to be what these next years are all about? fun and friends? well im not seeing it.... :(. i guess im just sad about letting some friendships die and other stuff. it really bothers me. well i could go on and rant all day, but im going to go practice guitar. that sorta makes me feel like im doing something worthwhile."

"event","Yah i haven't updated either journal in a <FONT size=4>waaaaaay</FONT> long time. of course i dont use my xanga nemore... so, lets see this week was a very busy one. I had to babysit from 9-2 on monday and thursday, and from 9-4 on tuesday and wednesday. the babysitting wasn't all that bad... just a few fights between the two kids. and of course the money is great :)! then i had a guitar lesson on monday which i sucked at... ahhhh that instrument is really frustrating. I was supposed to go to whitewater on friday with ty and cristina but the weather was crummy.... so we just watched movies and hung out. Today i went to the pool with my sister and attempted to start that mythology book for school. It's kind of a blah book, but I have to get through it somehow. Then i went to see harry potter with cristina, ty, robert, and jib. Haha that was fun! some lady told cristina and ty to shut up when they were laughing... haha! So tonight I really dont have any plans but to stay home and relax. Im leaving for Boston on July 5 and will be bak July 12 so if u guys want to do nething before then... that's cool! After I get back I won't have any time because of soccer and band starting up.... :(. Cya!"

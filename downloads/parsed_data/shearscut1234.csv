Some of us hold our hearts in the palm of our hands in such trust...such hope that the person you want to hand it to wont crush it or lay it to the side. But will handle it with care and concern for its health..for its feelings and well being.
Its a big thing...falling in love. So many thoughts, feelings, emotions...its all part of the experience, the joy of love. Knowing that the person who you put your trust, your feelings, your hopes gathers them with open arms and does their best to keep them safe.
Love isnt something that you can purchase or win...it doesnt always get returned the way your dreams played out. Its a big jump to take the risk knowing that you might be wiping away tears and patching your heart, hoping that one day love will be returned as much as you want to give it away. Not everyone wants to take the leap...take the risk, and thats something that we just need to understand. Feelings grow at different rates...they arent always going to match up 100%...and that ok.
Im a person that is willing to take risks. Hurt isnt easy....but it builds our muscle and it makes our heart stronger each time we give our heart away. Love doesnt come with a guarantee, but that shouldnt stop us! Be patient, stay sweet, stay strong, true love is bound to come your way! Hurt isnt the worst thing in the world! Its a great teacher...it softens and strengthens the heart and increases your capacity to love.
As for me...Im in love with an amazing person who Im willing to take risks for, and give the world to, and to have that kind of love...is a great feeling, that I hope doesnt fade..."

"event","Wow...its October already and in a couple of months a new year will begin. A new start, new goals, new resolutions.
Just been doing some thinking recently...here is what I came up with:""I need to forget about what is behind and strain toward what is ahead.""
2005 has been a pretty good year for the most part, cant complain too much. I graduated from Beauty school...passes my boards and received my license. Got out of some unhealthy situations and followed my heart. Quit my first salon job and recently got hired at The Surface. Do I want more?...Sure, who doesnt? Do I want to change?...Some. Will I realize how good life can be?...I sure do hope so! I just want to be happy and live my life to the fullest!
As you sit and listen to people talk...you realize that your life isnt that bad after all. But, human nature grabs us and makes us think that we have it so bad, and life isnt playing out they way we visioned it...and our problems are little peanuts compared to others. We feel as though we can pick and choose everything about our lives
As for myself, I know that there are things that I need to work on and change. Of course...I feel as though I need to do everything for myself...and not ask for help. I need to stop my worries and tears and not think so in depth about everything and just go with the flow...I try to control the future...and it doesnt work very well! There is no such thing as a ""perfect life""
I dont know what the future will bring for me...and that is something that I just need to let go...and go with the flow...flow is good! I realize that not everyone is going to like me, and you cant make people love you....I just want to be the best person that I can be...and love to the fullest and give until I cant give anymore! :)

Here is an Anti-Depression Kit...parts I got from an old friend:
-AN ERASER-So you can make all your problems go away
-A PENNY-So you never have to say ""Im broke""
-A MARBLE- In case someone says your lost yours
-A RUBBER BAND-To stretch yourself beyond your limits
-A STRING-To tie things together when everything falls apart
-A HUGGS- To remind you that someone cares
-A CHOCOLATE KISS-To remind you that you are loved
-A STICKER-To remind you to ""stick with it""
-A MATCH-To light your fire when you feel burned out
-A TOOTSIE ROLL-To remind you not to bite off more than you can chew
-SMARTIES-To help you on those days when you need extra smarts
-A STARBURST-To give you a burst of energy
-A SNICKERS-To remind you to take time to laugh
-A TOWELETTE-To clean up if things get messy
-A BIBLE PASSAGE-To keep you going
-A LITTLE BAG-To help you keep it all together"

Lets see...what has gone on in my life since August?...Well, first off, I found a JOB! Very stoked about that! Its at The Surface...and I actuallly started my training today! Im very excited, we start the hair show season in November...so I will be working some of the shows with Sexy Hair Concepts! Its really funny because last year at the Chicago Midwest Hair Show..I thought to myself that I wanted to get involved with hair shows and better myself. It feels really good to reach that goal, get into one of the top known salons in Fort Wayne! Tomorrow is another day of training and getting my picture taken for their website....
A couple of weeks ago, I also found out that I made the Fort Wayne Komets Jeep girls...pretty excited about that too! November will be a busy month! But all fun! I feel as though I have turned my life in the direction that I wanted! Nothing feels better!
Although things are going well....there is still stress in my life, and I dont think that will ever change LOL!! Well, thats it for now...leave some love :)"

"event","Almost September already. Wow, cant believe it, so much has happened in the past 2 months, been tough. Why do I feel like I work my butt off, and get nothing in return? Not all of the time....but a lot it seems.  I guess I just have a lot on my mind....
I dont really see myself as a ""mean"" or ""bad"" person...but it seems as though some do. Why does life have to be this way? Saddness and tears....I seem to be pretty good at both latley. So many ups and downs...I would do pretty much anything for a person if they ask, Im one that wants to make everyone I love happy before myself. I would rather cry and be upset than to see someone else in pain. I would do anything to please someone...maybe that is my weakness? I know that I cant purchase love, friendship or happiness, they arent things that can be won....maybe I try to hard. How do you even know if someone ""really"" loves you? LOVE~Strong or passionate affection for a person of the opposite sex. IN LOVE~Feeling love. What about a ""true"" friend? FRIENDSHIP~Friendly feeling or behavior. RELATIONSHIP~Connection.
All I can be is myself, nothing more, nothing less. If I cant be excepted for who and what I am, then they dont really love me. I dont need to be compaired to other people..because Im not going to be like them,therfore I wont win, nomatter how much someone wants. They say that you need to hang around people positive people who make you feel good. If your sad aor upset all the time...whats the point? Why put yourself through it. I know I do...I keep thinking that things will change, I know that I love them and its hard to leave someone you love.
I love being a giver! Sometimes I forget what it feels like to recieve...it feels good to be needed, and aweseome to be wanted....Maybe I try to hard to be accepted or try to hard to be loved. I tend to trust people farther than I could throw them...maybe I need to just sit back and wait....
ON SOME HAPPY NOTES!
I went into the Surface yesterday and talked to Kari..a girl that I was friends with in high school..she just broke up with her boyfriend (Ryan) of 4 1/2 years...she said it was the best move that she made yet! She is now dating a guy who treats her like a princess...she said that he spils her rotton...and she loves it :) she is in love and you could tell just by the look in her eyes! She said that he treats her so good, nothing like she has had before...she said that there are only a few awesome guys out there...HaHa
Joe and I have been together for 3 months now...awesome! He is stoked because soccer season is in full swing...and he starts school on Monday. I have been going from salon to salon dropping off my resume, and I have a interview tomorrow at the Surface...wish me luck! :)"

Well, I would have to say that I have had a lot on my mind...not just one certain thing either, everything....its hard not to think about it all...here is a few questions, If you care about someone then why dont you tell them? Dont just let them sit and ponder what you are thinking, thats tough. Why do some people tell others to move on if they care about them? How can you choose one friend over the other? Nothing makes any sense to me...please help! :)
Well, school is about to start, and that means many changes. Hope that I can make those changes smoothly! 
This weekend has gone REALLY slow for me! All I have been doing is work,sleep and visit family. We have a family reunion tomorrow...my Uncle Dennis is in from Texas so thats always fun! We only get to see him 2 times a year...so we soak it up when we can! What is really cool is that we finally had a chance to meet Grants girlfriend from Boston! Marleen is really nice and seems good for Grant! I know that its really hard for them since he is here and she is in Boston...I dont see how they do it! I would go crazy if I knew that I couldnt see the one I loved!
Well, thats about it for now...here is some songs from the wonderful Rascal Flatts that really makes you think about where you are and what people and life means to you...ENJOY!

WHEN THE SAND RUNS OUT
I spent the morning at an old friends grave
Flowers and amazing grace,
he was a good man
He spent his whole life spinnin his wheels
never knowin how the real thing feels
He never took a chance or took the time to dance
And I stood there thinking as I said good-bye
Today is the first day of the rest of my life..

IM GANNA STOP LOOKIN BACK AND START MOVING ON
AND LEARN HOW TO FACE MY FEARS 
LOVE WITH ALL MY HEART AND MAKE MY MARK
I WANNA LEAVE SOMETHING HERE
GO OUT ON A LEDGE WITHOUT ANY NET 
THATS WHAT IM GANNA BE ABOUT
YEAH..I WANNA BE RUNNIN WHEN THE SAND RUNS OUT!

Cause people do it everyday
Promise themselves theyre ganna change
Ive been there
But Im changin from the inside out
That was then and this is now
Im a new man yeah, Im a brand new man
And when they carve my stone theyll write these words
Here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth

CHORUS

And as the cold wind blows across the graveyard
I think I hear...the voice of my old friend whisper in my ear

CHORUS

I wanna be running when the sand runs out...
Oh yes I do

BLESSED THE BROKEN ROAD

I set on a narrow way
many years ago
Hoping I would find true love Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept Pushin through
I couldnt see how every sign
Pointed straight to you

THAT EVERY LONG LOST DREAM
LED ME TO WHERE YOU ARE
OTHERS WHO BROKE MY HEART
THEY WERE LIKE NORTHERN STARS
POINTING ME ON MY WAY
INTO YOUR LOVING ARMS
THIS MUCH I KNOW IS TRUE
THAT GOD BLESSED THE BROKEN ROAD
THAT LED ME STRAIGHT TO YOU

I think about the years I spent 
Just passin through
Id like to have the time I lost
And give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
Youve been there, you understand 
Its all part of a grander plan
That is comin true.

CHORUS

Now Im just rollin home
Into my lovers arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road 
That led me straight to you..
That God blessed the broken road 
That led me straight to you.."

"event","Have you ever wondered why your where your at in life? Things used to be so simple when I was younger! :) Now all it seems like Im doing is work...day dreaming...worry about things that I really cant control...wondering what others are thinking and if they do and think about the same things that I am. I am just one that likes to know what is going, is that too much to ask? :*/
I havent really had the best of luck lately, with friends and all...Some hate me and I dont even know why...they dont seem as if they even really care. Well, I do..Im a person that wants to make everyone else happy before myself. I worry about what people think and feel about me, and I would rather make myself cry than to have them upset. I love to spoil others just to see them smile...but its nice to be spoiled sometimes too!
Summer is almost over and school will be starting soon...not really looking forward to that because everyone will be more busy...except for me...Im excited to get to go and watch Joe play soccer though! Something to look forward too! It may be a little strange when school starts at first because I wont get to see him much, I am used to seeing him almost everyday of the week, so that might suck a little bit. But we will make it work! :) Things have been going well with us I think...the time we spend together always goes so fast...time flies when your having fun, right?! I think we are both on the same page for the most part...always good! This Tuesday will be fun, we are going to spend all day together and relax by the pool (if it doesnt rain). We really havent spent a whole day together before, so Im really looking forward to it, and I hope he is too :*) 
Well, thats it for now...leave some love <3"

Work has been going pretty well for the most part. I have really cut back my hourst in at the salon and only going in when I have clients on my books..I have been doing some appointment changing so that I have them on one or two days...so that helps!
At the Y...just the same old stuff! After School will be starting up here soon, so that will keep me busy for a while! Camp weeks are cutting down and I think some are ready for a break!
The search for a new salon continues...so that is exciting! Yeah..I dont think I want to make working at the YMCA a career! I want to move up and move on to bigger and better things in all aspects of my life...start making those dreams that seem so far out of reach a bit more of a reality!...Well thats my goal!
So..my weeks are busy with work and things that ""should"" get done, and my weekends and some week nights I spend time with Joe, when he isnt working..and even then I get to see him when he gets done...which is always fun! I have been watching him play soccer and score goal on Sunday afternoons too! We just had our 2 months and I think things are going well! We just relax and hang out with eachother...always fun :) Cant and wont complain about that!"

Well, it wasnt the easiest thing to tell a boss, but...I just put in my 2 week notice at the salon that I was working in...and I would have to say that they were not very happy with me! Oh well, I cant please everyone! I am going to be working at the wonderful (lol) YMCA until I find a new job...with better pay I hope!

~*WHAT IS SUCCESS?*~
WHAT IS SUCCESS?
TO LAUGH OFTEN AND MUCH;
TO WIN THE RESPECT OF INTELLIGENT PEOPLE
AND THE AFFECTION OF CHILDREN;
TO EARN THE APPRECIATION OF HONEST CRITICS
AND ENDURE THE BETRAYAL OF FALSE FRIENDS;
TO APPRECIATE BEAUTY;
TO FIND THE BEST IN OTHERS;
TO LEAVE THE WORLD A BIT BETTER, WHETHER BY
A HEALTHY CHILD, A GARDEN PATCH
OR A REDEEMED SOCIAL CONDITION;
TO KNOW EVEN ONE LIFE HAS BREATHED 
EASIER BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIVED;
THIS IS TO HAVE SUCCEEDED.

AND HER SEARCH GOES ON FOR HOLDING HANDS
WHAT DOESNT KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONG
AND STRENGTH GROWS WINGS TO FLY UPON
SHE FLIES ON WINGS SO WHITE AND PURE
FOR IN HER DREAMS SHE FEELS SECURE
LINES OF SONGS AND VERSES IN RHYME
WILL HEAL THE WOUNDS OF BITTER TIME
NO LONGER WILL SHE LIE IN SADNESS
AND PUT ON A SMILE TO HIDE THE MADNESS
YOUNG SOULS THAT SLIP AWAYS FROM TEARS
CAN STRENGTHEN HOPE THROUGH MANY YEARS
AND WITH NEW STRENGH SHELL RISE ABOVE
HEAL HER WOUNDS AND LEARN TO LOVE"

ALTHOUGH I LANDED SOFTLY
I SENSED ABRUISE OR SCAR
BUT THOSE WERE OFTEN MADE
IN MATTERS OF THE HEART

HOWEVER, DOUBT CONSUMED MY MIND
""WOULD HE BE LIKE THE LAST?""

Then...my boss Kristen told us that she will be done at the Y in 3 weeks...what a bummer! There will be lots of changed I think!
On the high note..Relationship wise I think all is well...Stef and Bry get time together without the worry of Ashley talking bad...and Joe and I are having a great time together!

I woke up at 6:00am to go feed the wonderful cows..then went to dad's work to drop some keys off, and was at the YMCA by 8:30, oh but it didn't end there...I then left the Y around 11:45 (15 min. later than I needed too), showed up at Grate Lengths 5 min. late, served one client, then turned around and went back to the Y until 4:00. I really enjoy working camp there...the kids yes...get annoying, but what kid doesn't? Well, my boss Carolyn called me at the Y and told me that I had an appointment call in for a 4:30, so I finished my day at Grate Lengths around 6:30. It has been a long day of work! Come on...how many times to you go to both of your jobs 2 times in one day? I feel like Superwoman! YES! Hey...at least tomorrow I dont have to start my day until 6:45! 
DID EVERYONE ELSE HAVE A GOOD DAY?

Here is just some stuff I came across....

LOVE CAN
*Love can set you free
*Love can bind you up
*Love can make you live
*Love can make you die
*Love can make you smile
*Love can make you cry
*Love can put a grin on your face
*Love can never be erased
*Love can leave a scar
*Love can heal a wound
*Love can make friends
*Love can let people go
*Love can make you smart
*Love can make you dumb
*Love can forgive
*Love LIVES and LIVES

I even had a color...amd might I say it looked great! So, in my books I say it canceled out my bad one from last week! LOL The day always goes by faster when your busy, and having nice talks with your clients. Today, I was talking to my moms friend Susan while I was coloring her hair. We started talking about relationships because her and her parents have not talked decent for a while now...and it is hard for her. She had a rough time during Fathers Day because her father wont talk to her! I couldnt believe that! Then we started talking about relationships in general.... We then moved into how her and her husband met, and it was quite funny because she was in my boat once too! She is the one that met C.J. and told me to run like hell. She didnt like the look in his eyes...anyways...she was telling me how bad it was because her ex started to stalk her and not stop calling her. She didnt like this because she was starting a relationship with another guy (which she is now married to). She told me to not try the whole ""we can be friend"" thing because thats when it gets hard. She said it was hard because it was like he was still in the picture and her boyfriend/husband didnt like that she had contact with him, I mean yeah, it would be hard knowing that they still talked on a day to day basis She recommended a ""clean break"". She knew that she had to do that so that she could continue her current relationship. It was a really good talk...she is a person that you can really talk too! She asked if I had anybody in line...of course I told her about Joe! She was really excited to hear about it! Its awesome! This past month has gone REALLY fast! Can you believe that we have been dating for 1 month this Thursday! Things are going good!"

Go To: Mysticball.com
This site I heard about from Ashley, it is actually quite funny!

This is just a quote from a lady that is funny but sometimes could be true! LOL
Oh sure, they say they're busy. They say that they didn't have even a moment in their insanely busy day to pick up the phone. It was just that crazy. All lies. With the advent of cell phones and speed dialing, it is almost impossible not to call you. Sometimes I call people from my pants pocket when I don't even mean to. If I were into you, you would be the bright spot in my horribly busy day. Which would be a day that I would never be too busy to call you. 

HaHa a wishful mindset!
There is something great about knowing that my only job is to be as happy as I can be about my life, and feel as good as I can about myself, and to lead as full and eventful a life as I can, so that it doesn't ever feel like I'm just waiting around for some guy/girl to ask me out. And most importantly, it's good for us all to remember that we don't need to scheme and plot, or beg anyone to ask us out. We're fantastic. 

Heard about this book from a co-worker...sounds interesting! Don't you think? :)
He's Just Not That Into You is provocative, hilarious and, above all, intoxicatingly liberating. It deserves a place on every woman's night table. It knows you're a beautiful, smart, funny woman who deserves better. The next time you feel the need to start ""figuring him out,"" consider the glorious thought that maybe he's just not that into you. And then set yourself loose to go find the one who is. 
Reexamining familiar scenarios and classic mindsets that keep us in unsatisfying relationships, Behrendt and Tuccillo's wise and wry understanding of the sexes spares women hours of waiting by the phone, obsessing over the details with sympathetic girlfriends, and hoping his mixed messages really mean ""I'm in love with you and want to be with you."""

When you think about what it takes for two people to agree that they want to be together, it is a miracle that there is a thing called a relationship.
Many of your happiest memories will be those moments when the person you liked returned those feelings and you suddenly found yourself ""involved"" with someone. But like everything else in life, the fantasy is usually better than the reality, and with this new experience comes many new problems.
The best advice that we can receive is to remember that relationships can bring you great happiness but also great pain. It all goes with the territory. But with all the heartache a relationship entails, it is still a wonderful and precious thing.
That is why the most famous relationships quote is one that reminds us, ""It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.""
This is one of our main goals as humans is to learn how to give and receive love. If we remember to always learn from what happens, then we will always be able to look at love and say, ""It was worth every minute. The happiness and the pain were like exercise for my heart, each time leaving it in better shape than before.""
Many times, we have heard people say a relationship takes commitment. This is often taken to mean that in order for it to work, you must promise to love the person forever and always. The kind of commitment that is needed is one that says""
~I am willing to learn from my mistakes.
~I am willing to look at both sides of the situation.
~I will communicate honestly and respectfully.
~AND THE BIG ONE! ~I will take responsibility for my part in this.
Now this sounds very grown-up, but relationships are grown-up stuff. 
As for some general advice:
~ENJOY THE RIDE.
~LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
~NOBODY IS WORTH GIVING UP YOUR VALUES FOR
~FRIENDS WILL BE AROUND LONG AFTER BOYFRIENDS/GIRLFRIENDS
~YOU PROBABLY WONT MARRY YOUR FIRST LOVE
~YOU PROBABLY THINK YOU WILL
~AS MUCH AS LOVE HURTS, IT ALSO HEALS
~LOVE YOURSELF FIRST
~BE KIND TO YOUR OWN HEART AND TO THE HEARTS OF OTHERS
~LOVE JUST HAPPENS. WE DONT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING

WHAT IS LOVE?

LOVE IS...
....when you feel something more than friendship but cant quite describe it
....when you begin to see someone in a very positive light
....suddenly being nervous, shy and unable to think of anything to say whenever you    are near a certain someone
....wanting to be close to someone, both emotionally and physically
....being excited about going to school/work because you know you are going to see him/her
....wanting to look your very best when you know you will be seeing him/her
....caring for this other person in ways you havent cared before
....wanting nothing more than to see that person smile
....growing faint when that person smiles at you
....not caring if your friends dont think he/she is the cutest guy/girl in the world, because you do
....being willing to stick around and work things out when difficulties start arising
....rushing home to call or be called by him or her
....being able to be smart and fun around everybody until he/she shows up and then you are unable to say anything that even makes sense
....listening to the words to songs that you never bothered listening to before
....wanting to read poetry in hopes it will express what it is that you are feeling
....thinking that everything he/she does is so incredible. You have never met anyone so interesting, so funny or so cute
....having him/her on your mind

SHE HAS NO TIME

You think your days are uneventful
And no one ever thinks about you
She goes her own way
She goes her own way 
You say your days are ordinary
And no one ever thinks about you
But we're all the same
And she can hardly breathe without you 

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time 

Think about the lonely people
Then think about the day she found you
Or lie to yourself
And see it all dissolve around you 

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time 

Lonely people tumble downwards
My heart opens to you
When she says 

She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time
For you now
She says she has no time

  
 

SOMEWHERE ONLY WE KNOW

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete 
Oh simple thing where have you gone
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin 

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of? 

Oh simple thing where have you gone
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin 

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know? 

Oh simple thing where have you gone
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

BEND AND BREAK

When you, when you forget your name
When old faces all look the same
Meet me in the morning when you wake up
Meet me in the morning then you'll wake up 
If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side
I'll meet you in the light
If only I don't suffocate
I'll meet you in the morning when you wake 

Lovesick bitter and hardened heart
Aching waiting for night waiting for life to start
Meet me in the morning when you wake up
Meet me in the morning then you'll wake up 

If only I don't bend and break
I'll meet you on the other side

THe minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may holdon to some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact. But hold too tightly, too possessively, and the relationship slips away and is lost. ~ Kaleel Jamison

By: Jane Watkins
In looking back I realize
The first time is a measure
I'll use to weigh my memories
That tomorrow I will treasure.

First kiss, first date, first phone call
First one to hold my hand
First time to feel the kind of love
I hardly understand.

Yet after careful viewing
If it won't hold up to light
I'll have another ""first time""
To try and get it right.

Waiting for me just like I'm waiting for him.
Feeling the same things I'm feeling right now,
Thinking there may never be an end to the loneliness,
The longing,
The void that grows with each passing minute.
He's out there,
Somewhere,
Dreaming of me.

To be his.

Will be enough.

"event","Well, not much really went on today...thought I was going to catch up on some stuff, but didnt...oh well! I guess it will just have to wait! So far...its been a pretty crappy weekend...thought it was going to be good, boy was I wrong! Today, I was just irritable I guess, but it really hurts when friends dont really act like friends. You always try to tell yourself that words dont hurt us, haha thats wrong! Im kindof tired of some people being shitty and a mouthy sometimes....and when you get your hopes up, and then you get let down. I would have to say feelings were hurt, but I guess thats something that Im going to have to get past, not like I havent been hurt before...right!? I cant even think straight right now! My head is in too many places...I think that is a sign for bed....
I hope the rest of my weekend is a little brighter than today was!"

"event","First off...Im so excited about the nice 3 day weekend that is heading our way! Its about time for a break! Now, I just have to make plans on my 1 day off! LOL! Humm...what has happened since Sunday...well, on Monday night Joe and I became official, its really cool because we get along so well! We both said awhile ago that we would just see what happens...and this is where we are right now...so now we see what happens from here...how fun, lots to look forward too! I found out today that I dont have a summer job at the Y, other than just being a sub...great! So, now I kindof have to watch my spending for 2 months, until I start back in After School in August. Then its save, save, save to pay off my school loan ASAP! 
I really cant complain that much...my life is going pretty good right now. Just trying to relax more, just lay back, go with the flow and as much fun as I can! Of course it isnt always all fun! But those are the times when you sit back and ask yourself....why?how?what if? All and all, Im happy right now...so its all good! :) Now..its time to do nothing......YES! :)

So how is everyone else doing?...."

"event","This is just great...Im at my brothers house because our dumb AOL is a piece of shit! So I had to come ""visit"" my brother just to use his computer..how nice am I? :) HaHa They love me!..but I do wish Grant would fix ours...this is kindof inconvenient for me! LOL
Oh....Last night was pretty fun hanging out with the girls! I met a friend of Abby's (Katie) who is a lot of fun! It is so much fun being the young one in the group and the only one under age! HaHa! We didnt really stop the party until 3:30...and then we woke up at 4:00 because a friend of ours ended up in the hospital with chest pains, so we didnt get much sleep after that excitement! I ended up sleeping on Abby's floor because Ashley wouldnt stop hitting me! The floor....not so good! I think my neck and back are finally starting to feel a little better! I woke up around 7:30 and couldnt fall back to sleep...so I went home about 8 and crashed on my own bed! How nice! :) Its been a lazy day really...went to camp staff training from 1-5...wasnt to bad except I had to get in the cold pool! Not fun! Im not a big water person....but honestly it wasnt that bad...Now Im sitting at home waiting for 7:00 to come around so that I can go to my LAST Living Discipleship class. Im kindof happy that it is done after tonight! It has been a long 16 weeks! What Im doing after that is up in the air...I hope that Stef, Ashley, and Bry Bry have/had a great time at the Komets game! BRATS! :)
Life is so crazy! I cant believe how things have changed! Im so excited for my brother Russ! He had a date last night! I know that he has been on dates before, but this is the first one that I know something about! How fun! Its kindof funny because my parents have 4 single kids....from the ages of 20-30! I guess you cant plan anything! You never know what is around the corner and going to bite you in the ass! :) Its all good though! I have learned a lot in the past 2 months...You need to believe in yourself, Try to always think positive and not to worry about everything..(that is kindof hard, but Im doing my best), Everything happens for a reason, and What happens....happens. I had a problem with always trying to plan what happens because I was scared of getting hurt. I have became stronger, I think, that doesnt mean I wont get hurt, but I think dealing with it is getting better! I like to hear things the way that they are...I dont like candy coated stuff...tell it like it is so that we can handle it...it is so awesome how I have seen myself change... Im actually happy with everything that is going on in my life! How many times can someone say that? Im sure things arent always going to be dandy...but oh well..I need to try to go with it...! God wouldnt build a mountain that I cant climb..right?!"

Last night we went shopping...I spent way too much like normal. Then Stefanie, Bry Bry, Ashley, Joe and I went to Lazer X...might I say I SUCK! :) But it was a lot of fun! After that we went to see A Lot Like Love...was a good movie, but kindof drawn out...It is just amazing how things happen..something happened this weekend that I didn't think would..Awesome! Let me say I do believe all things happen for a reason! Stef and Bry Bry..everything is gong to be fine this summer! Stef and I will make road trips! I promise! :)Then today (Sunday) I went to church..was suppost to mow, but it rained..darn! So I took a nice nap! What a stressful day! LOL

I know you can't change what people want..but in a way its hard to feel good enough for that person ya know? I know what I want in my heart, and I feel that I poured it out way to soon, and now I set myself up to be hurt, not by them, but by myself. Am I good enough? Am I worth a risk? Are our feelings the same? Am I the one that will win if all else fails? Do things have to fail for me to win? Are feelings growing or stopping? I wish that I didnt have all this time to think! LOL But feelings come and go, and they come and grow...."

What is even more nuts is that Joe and I went to Borders to just sit for a while and you will never guess who shows up...CJ! It was kindof funny! He always questions Joe....and I really don't care! I just wish he would get the clue to leave me alone! Im glad that Joe and I had a chance to talk and kindof figure things out...I know that he needs to be with his girlfriend and figure out if she is the one for him. It is just crazy... I love every time we spend time together..its just a hard thing knowing that you can't be with someone you know you care so much about..Oh tonight was fun....I suck at bowling, but hey thas ok...I guess you can't be the best at all you do!

"event","Oh were do I even begin? I would have to say my life has been on a emotional roller coaster ride and I don't know where my next stop is going to be. For some reason it is going where I didn't expect it to go... Things have been awesome though because I have been able to spend time with a lost friend Stefanie! She has been there for me the whole time and it is strange because I know I took her for granted, and I regret it. Things have been crazy in my life for over a month...I just wish there would be a conclusion! But I guess I just have to wait and see where life goes next..The hardest thing is not knowing what is going to happen next. One of the hardest things I feel is knowing that you have feelings for someone, and not knowing if they are the same or going to be returned someday...I know that God won't make a mountain that I can't climb..but that doesn't mean I won't struggle! haha I am so happy for Stefanie and ""Bry Bry"" they found love! I have never seen her eyes light up as much as they do when they look at eachother...im jealous!...oh well all things happen for a reason! It is awesome to see her happy! Love you girl!

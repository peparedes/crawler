"event","<P>Randy was obviously in a bad mood when he read&nbsp;my journal. Hehe. </P>
<P>I didn't really <EM>care</EM> that Andy Roddick lost at the quarterfinals of the US Open. I was just interested in seeing him play against Andre Agassi, if possible, but Agassi bowed down to Federer as well. I thought it would be interesting to see Agassi and Roddick battle it out against each other because Roddick is now being coached by Brad Gilbert, Agassi's own long time coach. I just noticed that both players play very quickly and waste little or no time between points. Plus, one is old and one is young, but both are good.&nbsp;I knew, though, deep down that Federer would prevail at the end, and so he did (although I was secretly hoping that Hewitt would beat him, just to spice things up a bit). </P>
<P>And yes, I do love and prefer the finesse game, which is why I adored Pete Sampras. And hate the Williams sisters ;) Right now, Federer is doing so well and looking so formidable that it appears he's going to become part of history as one of the sport's greatest. I don't think I've ever seen anybody look like he belongs with a tennis racket in his hand the way Roger does. He kicks ass. Hopefully he doesn't get injured. And hopefully the other players step up quickly so that it doesn't become too predictable. </P>
<P>I can hear Chico's voice in my head as I'm writing this. If he reads this, he would probably say that I sound like a commentator again. Tee-hee. So much thought and analysis given to a sport I can't even play.... </P>"

"event","I just found out that Andy Roddick lost his quarterfinal match against Johannson. He was broken at his last service game in the fifth set. After coming back from being two sets down, this is most unfortunate. I was hoping that he would be able to defend his title. Oh well. I suppose a Federer-Hewitt final would also be good. 

My favorite among the women is Justine Henin-Herdenne, who also lost in the third or fourth round. Now that she's gone, I really have nobody else to root for. The Williams sisters are out (thankfully!), but I just don't see myself being happy about a Davenport or a Capriati championship. Hmmm. 

Sigh. I really wish Pete Sampras hadn't retired.

Anyhoo, I know I'm only thinking about tennis because I don't want to think about tomorrow. Very big day. Exam in the morning, game against FEU in the afternoon, and the birthday of a good friend. I'm not too sure how I feel about the first two, but I know the latter is bound to be fun."

"event","<P>As I neared Gate 2 of Ateneo last Saturday, I felt the rush of anticipation that usually accompanies one who is coming home for the first time in years. I leaned forward in my seat expectedly, awaiting the wonder that I <EM>always</EM> feel upon entering the campus. Once again, the trees that line the street from Loyola Gym to Gonzaga greeted me. On foot, I now proceeded to what I had come for--the Office of Graduate Services.</P>
<P>Ateneo looked and felt&nbsp;the same but different. Or maybe it was different but the same. It was odd to see the same grounds with new flowers, the same walkways with new stones. And yet, it was still... right, somehow, despite the fact that I could not find a single soul around me that I knew. It was like being a stranger inside my own house, as if I were a ghost that was haunting it. When that hazy feeling left me, I realized that I was being too dramatic. Here now ""lived"" a new generation of people, but the institution, and all that&nbsp; it stands for, remains the same. And that is what I have come back for. </P>
The opportunity to learn is something I have always valued in my life. I loved being a student. I remember being a senior and hoping against hope that it would never end. And the truth is it is easy to go back for that purpose and live the life of a ""child"". The temptation to fall into that trap of orienting everything inward, absorbing like a sponge--that to me is too easy. But as much as I only took it all in when I was in college, it is also my education that taught me that one cannot simply live that way. Learning should serve a higher purpose other than the acquisition of knowledge alone. 
Magis. Service and Excellence.
<P>With this thought on my mind, I moved on to my destination. </P>

"event","<P>Last summer, a thought exploded in my head. <EM>I want to go back to school and take my masters. </EM>More importantly, <EM>I want to take my masters not only for my own self-actualization, but also to be able to teach psychology to college students. </EM>The idea grew and grew inside my head until I couldn't stop thinking about it. I felt like I was being called. </P>
<P>Teaching was not something that I ever considered to be my career. But as my Ateneo education progressed, and&nbsp;my teachers began to change my life in many little ways, I couldn't help but think about how valuable they have been to my formation. When after graduation I was still thinking about them and telling people about how wonderful my teachers were, the path became clearer and clearer in my head. Until one day, the realization hit me: there can't possibly be anything better than teaching. I've always wanted to make a difference in this world. What better way to do it than this? </P>
<P>I know it all sounds so sudden, especially because I have been known to make big decisions spontaneously. But I believe that my instincts are leading me in the right direction. I must be clear, though; I love my current job and intend&nbsp;to keep it. But I know I can work, study, and hopefully teach all at the same time. I'm young, idealistic, and raring to go, and I still have my whole life ahead of me. The itch needs to be scratched. And now is the time to do it. </P>
<P>Tomorrow morning,&nbsp;I am going to Ateneo to get my application form for admission to the second semester. There is no need to wait any longer. I can hear the universe conspiring to take me to where I want to be, and hopefully, where I <EM>should</EM> be.</P>

"event","So. I finally decided to give this a shot. Writing reports at work has made me feel like I have lost all of my creative juices. Maybe this can help me find it again. Just like many people I know, I'm a secretly frustrated writer. Actually, I'm secretly frustrated about many things. But talk about that belongs in a different entry. 

Sometimes there are too many thoughts in my head. I've found that writing them down helps put things in perspective, as well as allows me to articulate how I really feel. And so I begin this live journal, with an attempt to make lemonade."

"event","Holy shit... Ive done more physically today then I have in a long time, and shit, it feels pretty good.

Rode at Keystone today with Deuce. Shot around the backside of the mountain for a while, then hit the park for the rest of the day. Finally got frontside boardslides down (I pulled a nice fronside to switch on the 20 foot park bench rail). Hopefully the picture of it came out good. 

While i should be proud about landing a new trick, its hard to be when there was so many good kids that were half of my age there. Apparently, Sports illustrated for kids thought it would be fun to host a search for the ""next generation of snowboarding stars"". Kids from all over the country came to Keystone on my riding day and took over the park

me: 20 foot boardslide to switch.

8 year old that went after me: switch backside boardslide to 50-50 to frontside boardslide to 270 off.

Fuck! When I was that age I was playing sega and burning army men. Kids these days...

After this, I went to rugby practice. goddamn it was tough. So many squat jumps and linouts. Even thouhg i can barely move my legs, it feels good to push myself like that

Now its time to do microeconomics, logic, AND anthropology homework. It feels good to do something with the day...

An update on my summer: 

Ive found out that the Zumiez up here is hiring. If I get the job, Im will stay here. While Zumiez is a shit place to work (mall ""skateshops"" suck greatly), its at least considered ""skateshop experience"". After talking to my roomate, he says that all good shops require that to work in them, and if I had it, he could probably get me a job at the shop he works at (The Wright life). Since the skateboard/snowboard industry is something i would LOVE to get in to, I think this would be very benificial."

"event","Ok, so heres the deal. I really want to know what everyone thinks of this, so please give me your honest answer. I could really use the responses.

So, last weekend I went down to Austin, Texas for a rugby tournament. While there, one night i went to a club with everyone else on the team, even though I knew it wasnt my thing. So, while sitting around on the side drinking beers, I started talking to this girl. One thing led to another, and we ended up back at her place. Now Im not one for one night stands (I really dont like the idea of sleeping with random people), but I decided ""hey, I havent gotten anything for a while, so why not"". Well, the problem with everything is that over the course of the night, I actually started to like her... a lot. She just seemed to be going in the same direction in life as me, which is all I ever wanted in a girl. She liked the same things (music, snowboarding, etc), was good looking, partied the same way, and even felt the same way about what we were doing that night (we were both drunk, and it was both our first one night stand). Well, it did only last one night, as the second night i couldnt meet up with her because of extrenuous circumstances on both parties, so I left Austin with only her phone number.

Flash forward to this week. She was just a one night stand, right? just fuck and forget. But I cant forget. I  still think about her.  That night seemed almost like fate... why would two people who are so alike and who both went to a club only because their friends dragged them to it meet? She was so easy to talk to, I loved every minute of it.

My dilemma: do I call her? I honestly dont know what would come out of it; we both live so far away from each other, its not like we could date. But I cant stop thinking about her. I really have no fucking clue what to do

REally, it seems like love is a joke for me; like some supreme being is watching me and having a good fucking laugh. Whenever I meet someone I really like or love, there is always some little thing that fucks everything up. Some little variable that keeps me from being truely happ with that person. Look at my track record of relationships/ crushes/ etc, its all there.

Other big things that have happened since the last update was that I went snowboarding for the first time this season on sunday, which was also my first day ever of true backcountry snowboarding. I hiked all the way up a mountain that was over 13,000 feet for just one run down. The hike took all day, and wasnt on a path. It was literally climbing up in snow that was up to my thighs. When we got to the top, the sun was setting and it felt like i was on top of the world. It was definitely one of the best runs I have ever taken, i can tell you that much.

Saturday was filled with rugby and more jungle juice. Sunday Stevo and I sat around his house, played video games, and got high. Perfect way to end the week.

The rugby game on saturday made me realize what I love most about rugby. The comrodery. It doesnt matter if you are on the opposite team, you still have the common bond that you are both playing rugby at that given time. When playing the Fort Collins men side, I made a particularly hard tackle on another player. After the ruck was over, the guy rolled away, and helped me up, saying ""nice hit, you really fucked me up there"".

The stories I heard about him sounded like a completely different person the i came to know as grandpa French(IE: Before his operation, he got into a serious debate with my uncle about the economic benefets of smoking dope instead of drinking). 

Seeing my whole family together was also great. I got to see all of my cousins who i never see because of the fact that we are scattered around the country. Getting completely shitfaced with my family was also a lot of fun. We must have toasted my grandpa about 10 times that night, moving from his favorite wine to beer to straight whiskey.

Why the fuck are there lines out the door at the IMP? its the third week of it being open. There is no rush, so, to all the freshmen out there, chill the fuck out. You will  have enough time to finish everything. it doesnt need to be done in the first coupel weeks.

Rugby tonight will probably be mostly conditioning. This wont make my day better.

The only thing that really went well today was that campus west is selling handles of Southern Comfort for only 19.99. But, with my luck, its probably the white label SoCo."

Generated on Wed Sep 1 16:47:57 2004.

      Your Existing Situation
            Sensitive and understanding but under some strain; needs to unwind in the company of someone close to him.
    
  Your Stress Sources
            Sensitive, and susceptible to gentleness and delicacy of feeling, with a desire to blend into some sort of mystic fusion of erotic harmony. However, this desire remains unsatisfied due to the lack of a suitable partner or adverse conditions, and he keeps a strict and watchful control on his emotional relationships as he needs to know precisely where he stands. Is fastidious, esthetic, and has a cultured taste which allows him to form and express his own taste and judgment, especially in the fields of art and artistic creativity. Strives to ally with others who can assist him in his intellectual or artistic growth.
     
 Your Restrained Characteristics
            Wants to broaden his fields of activity and insists that his hopes and ideas are realistic. Distressed by the fear that he may be prevented from doing what he wants; needs both peaceful conditions and quiet reassurance to restore his confidence.

            Very exacting in the standards he applies to his choice of a partner and seeking a rather unrealistic perfection in his sex life.


      Your Desired Objective
            Defiantly opposes any sort of restriction or opposition. Sticks obstinately to his own point of view in the belief that this proves his independence and self-determination.
      
Your Actual Problem
            His natural ability to examine everything with critical discrimination has been distorted into an attitude of harsh disapproval, which opposes and denigrates without regard to the real facts.
     
 Your Actual Problem #2
            The need for esteem--for the chance to play some outstanding part and make a name for himself--has become imperative. He reacts by insisting on being the center of attention, and refuses to play an impersonal or minor role."

Increaingly, I keep getting the feeling that my whole life is some sitcom for others to watch, and when things go to fuck, i can almost hear the laugh track in the background. Thsi leads me to the question Who did I fuck over to ahve such shitty karma?"

"event","Well I got the job at Lowes.  Sandra is making <b>$.80</b> more than me an hour, I'm not sure why.  A job is a job and I'm getting 5 cents more than I was at the state so I suppose that's a step up for me right? LOL

I ordered an <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/"">iPod Mini</a> last week. I also got a Bob and Tom VIP pass that has a pod cast part of it.  I can get B&T on my iPod which well help me get thru the day.

As for the actual job at lowes I'm not sure if I'm excited about it or not.  I guess I'll find out as soon as my drug test and background check comes back.  A job is a job and I think I'll do good at it so only time will tell.

Me and Sandra:  I'm not sure what's going on here.  I still love her.  But I'm still not sure if it's going to work out or not.  We made a deal where we'd only see eachother once a week to try to stem the fighting and stuff.  I for one was alot happier not seeing her as much and I'm not sure if that's a good sign or not, I don't think it is.  I spent Sunday with her and I was just kind of didn't really care one way or another.  When she got upset I didn't do what I wanted to do rather I did what I thought she'd want me to do.  That's anot a good way to have a realtionship.  I'm going to give it another go but I'm not doing many more go arounds if you know what I mean.  I can't live life like I'm on egg shells so I won't piss her off.  I can't and won't do it.  But I do love her so I'll give it another go around.

I can't wait for my iPod to get here. I also ordered a Jimmie Johnson Pit Cap ""Gotta support the team"""

"event","Well my job at the Department of Revenue is over.  I loved it.  I loved the people. I loved the actual job.  It was one of the happiest times of my life.  I only missed 2 days in a span of 4 months! That's good for me.  I wanted to get up at the ass crack of dawn to goto work. It was awesome.  All this ended on Wed.  It was the last day. We ended at noon, at noon I got the best compliment I have ever recieved. Jeff, a guy who sat next to me for the majority of the time there said ""You proved to me that not everyone under 35 isn't an asshole."" This made me happy.  

Sandra and I, I don't know.  We fight all the damn time and it seems to be about stupid shit in my mind.  I'm  not real sure how much longer we're going to be togather.  I'm alot happier being alot rather than with her. I'm not sure that's a real good sign!  I'm going to think about it over the weekend and make a decision.

The bad part of this all is the fact that she got a job at Lowe's in Jeff City and guess who's going for his last interview tomorrow, *right here*  If we keep fighting I'm going to end it but it'll suck having to work with her.    

I'm also going to apply at the 911 dispatch place here in Versailles, it's alot closer than jeff and pays about 2 bucks more an hour.  so We'll see.  

Things are looking bright for me.  We'll see what happens in the next week."

I like my job, it's the hardest thing to do in the world and it's really repetive but hey if it pays da bills it pays da bills you know what I'm sayin' :P  I like the people I work with, I have yet to meet one asshole *knock on wood*

There are no cute girls working with me so that sort of sucks.  There's one I want to school with though but she smokes and is getting married to an assbag so I guess I don't have to worry about her. 

The drive isn't killing me yet, all I have to do is tune it to Bob and Tom in the morning and I'm fine getting up there.  On the way home is spent talking to my parents and some times Mark.  I have a cool new camera phone that also has speaker phone built in so I can talk and not worry about hold the thing up to my ear.  Hella cool.   I haven't had a panic attack driving which I was afraid of, I think I finally conqured that fear.  

The apartment has been in a stalemate since last week.  I didn't feel like getting out there and working on it and Dad sure as hell didn't.  I hope we can work a  little bit more on it this weekend.  I'd like to move in soon if at all possible."

I start my job in 8 days. I'm excited yet nervous.

We are going to make half of the garage into a Studio Apartment for me.  It's going to cost about 500. Dad has said he'll split the amount of money with me so we're going to do that and move the kids up here soon.

The heat bill at the shop was $250 alone, I'm really pissed off about that, I wish Margie would let me out of the lease, so we'll see what's going on.

I paid off 2 of my credit cards,  I only owe about 3500 on one now LOL

I got my gaming rig going, after a little SNAFU with a power plug, eh WTF I learned a lesson.  

My N2K3 seems to be corupted, I've done everything but change the CD, all the hardware on the gaming rig is dffrent so that's not the issue, so I ordered a new copy.  That's $40 on a old game that might be replaced by EA's NSR by May.  Oh well I need seat time even if it's in a diffrent sim than what we'll be racing.  I can't wait to get the new copy of N2K3 so maybe I can run some laps without having to worry about a corrupted CD.
this computer build has fought me every single step of the motherfucking way.  I'll be happy to kick it in the ass.

Auctions Technology will cease to exist in 2 weeks.  Andy Small Enterprises will take it's place, Champion Computer Services and Champion Auctions will be what takes place the actual nuts and bolts of Auctions Tech.  Andy Small Enterprises will be the parent company.  Andy Small Racing will be part of ASE.  Most of you don't care about that but I'm rebuilding my company, it might stay a part time deal, it might go full time.  I might be a Racing effort who knows.  All I know is the ground work is there

I want a nice girl to put out.  Not just sex, I want a girlfriend, I want that tinglely feeling. I'm sick of watching PORN, I want to delete it all off my TiVo out of respect of my new G/f.  We shall see race fans, we shall see."

This was the final nail in the coffin that was my TA business.  I simply can't justify taking anymore consignments from my clients.  I can't justify doing this anymore.  I'm moving my business into Computer Service.  This is just nuts."

So....Here's where I need help.
I need a good company name.  There are a couple of requirements however:
It must not be registered as an LLC in the State of Missouri: <a href=""https://www.sos.mo.gov/BusinessEntity/soskb/csearch.asp"">Find out what is HERE</a>
It must have a domain name I can buy, but I can work around this one.

I'm looking for a company name that ties into my love for racing.  

The business is going to be a Computer repair/eBay consignment biz.
here's what I've come up with so far
1. The Vortex Group (with Vortex Auctions being a subsidary)
2. The Champion Group (with Champion Computer Services and Champion Auctions)
3. Champion Computer Services
4. Vortex Technology Services
5. Champion Technology Services
6. Show Me Technology Services

if you think of a really cool name but it's taken as an LLC or something of that nature I can always register Andy Small Enterprises and have it as the parent company for the cool named company.

I'll be interested to see what you can come up with."

"event","What the American Flag Stand For
by 6th grader, Charlotte Aldebron, written in 2002

The American flag stands for the fact that cloth can be very important. It is against the law to let the flag touch the ground or to leave the flag flying when the weather is bad. The flag is to be treated with respect. You can tell just how imprtant this cloth is because when you compare it to people, it gets much better treatment. Nobody cares if a homeless person touches the ground. A homeless person can lie all over the ground all night long without anyone picking him up, folding him neatly and sheltering him from the rain.
School children have to pledge loyalty to this piece of cloth every morning. No one has to pledge justice and equality human decency. No one has to promise that people will get a fair wage, or enough food to eat, or affordable medicine, or clean water, or airfree of harmful chemicals. But we all have to promise to love a rectangle of red, white, and blue cloth. Betsy Ross would be quite surprised to see how successful her creation has become. But Thomas Jefferson would be disappointed to see how little of the flag's real meaning remains."

Tomorrow either I'm going to write a letter, call, or have mom call my land lady to see if I can get out of the lease early.  I would move Auctions Tech here and either slow way down or try the home base approach.  I think I'm going to go out and look for a job.  Although I don't really want to give up on the company I feel I have to right now to keep my sanity.  I think that I can do a much better job working for someone else right now and doing this part time.  Hey if i move this to home all the profits will be mine.  I won't have to pay $600 a month in bills.  If I make 100 that week that's a extra 100 I didn't have before.  So yeah I've pretty much gave up on the drop off store in Versailles.  Maybe some day, but this is not the right time.  I want to get a job where I know what I'm making every week. Where I don't have to deal with clients who think I'm trying to steal from them.

Auctions Tech is a great idea.  One that prolly would have taken off in say Jeff City or Osage Beach,  But not in Versailles.  

I wish I wasn't such a pussy so I could call my land lady myself but I'm afraid she'll yell at me or something.  I'm going to have mom call her, I bribed her with more poker money, which in the long run if the land lady says yes then I'm in.  I hope mom will call her.  I hope I don't have to write a letter and wait for a reply. I'm sick of waiting I want to start making money."

While talking to Mark on the phone I decided to skip real racing for a while and come out of retirement and run some sim racing.  I ordered a video card and a wheel and the game (I had it but who knows if the CD is still good ya know?)  Since we are going to have DSL at the house I can actually run a race and not worry about my connection. Yayness.

DSL is one step away from being ready at the house.  everyday I do a ipconfig to see if this is the time that I will be able to nut in my pants cuz I have dsl.  Never does it work, but the final day for it to work is Monday so I'm sure they are working on it.  I'm pumped that I'll have highspeed."

Tuesday the satilite guy came (on time, which is big)  and he told us he didn't think we could have a TiVo in my room and the living room, mom, in here I want you to be happy way said I could have the TiVo but I told her that if there was only going to be one TiVo they could have it.  I started to really pity myself because this THIS was sposed to be my One and only Xmas present.  So he was on and off the phone for about 20 mins and then Direct TV decided to let him do it.  So he went outside and started putting up the sats (there are 2 one for locals and one for everything else)  and running the wire.  This took him about 2 hours but he had a lot of work ahead of him.  

I helped him run the wire into the house then I helped him get my TiVo hooked up, hell I figure I'm a geek I can do this and save him some time.  So I got it all hooked up and he started getting them activated.  All went fine till mine came around.  The local channels weren't all coming in.  He called another tech and she came with another unit

She told us she used to live in our house and that her room was now mine.  They were working on troubleshooting the TiVos they were on and off the phone so much to try to get people to tell them what was wrong, everyone was saying that it was the coax, but they changed it like 5 times.  Finally they said that ANOTHER tech would be coming with them after he got into town,  they moved the good TiVo into my room and the bad one which wasn't playing locals into the living room.  They call at about 10 to say the thrid tech dumped his truck in a ditch and they were going to have to get hime out before they got to our place.  They call about 2m ins later and say they will be there in 15 mins.  It's 10:30  now and they show up.  Most of the time they spend talking while the stuff downloads.  finally at 12:30 am Wed  it's working it just needs to be activated.  They call Direct TV and there computers are down for an update.  We try to do it online and no joy.  The first tech, who has been at the house for over 12 hours says he'll come in the morning to activate the whole thing

--

I wake up at 8:30 Wed and I feel like I have  a hang over, I'm tired and cranky and I just want to go home so I decide to go into work and just chill and hope my headache will go away, it didn't.  I come home at 10:30 and the tech is just finsihing up.  I just pud around the house wanting to take a nap so when mom says she's going to take a nap I go in my room to lay down but I can't sleep, I'm too busy playing with my TiVo. 

The mail comes and I get it, there is a letter in it from the division of Family Services I figure it's the latest update on what dad owes the state of NH so I open it up thinking I can have some good news for dad.  Good news indeed! There is a check for $350 in the letter so mom calls to make sure it's not a SNAFU.  It's  not DAD'S DONE WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT.  We call him and he's on cloud nine.  

We went shopping last night and then watched the West Wing.  My TiVo recorded both The West Wing and Myth Busters at the same time, I'm in love with TiVo"

Saturday all day I just slacked off and did nothing, I didn't even have a proper dinner.  I just ate fries.  I don't know what's wrong with me latley but I have no hunger.  
Saturday was the big night, the night ""3"" was going to premier.  I was excited, mom and dad were excited.  I watched about 30 races that Dale won.  I miss the #3 I miss him. 
So we were watching ""Sports Century: Dale Earnhardt"" when a truck pulled up into the drive way.  We didn't know right off who it was but it turned out to be Scott.  After over a year of not seeing him he pulls up and  we start talking, turns out he quit college and is doing some union work laying floors.  Chris is in Iraq.  Stupid fucker volunteered for that shit.

Scott stayed till 1 am.  Thank god for TiVo.  We started watching 3 only to have the thing FUBAR and we only got to see the first half of it, during that time Mark calls to tell me of his female antics that night, it was funny, I can't really explain why but it was funny.  

Sunday

I told him I wished I could afford it but right now I can't.  so we got home and told mom I was going to start looking for some jobs and if I found one she would have to run Auctions Tech during the day and any consignments she got I would put on in the evening.

Yesterday went by and I was thinking alot about my future.  I really want money, I really want a newer car, I really want to have a pay check every week.  When we got home from shopping I looked for state jobs and 2 caught my eye.  Both from the Department of Revenue.  One is a computer one  and the other one is an office support assistant.  I don't think I'm qualified for the Computer one since i only have a semester of college but the office one is right up my alley.  Most of the stuff it involves is what I do day to day here, including Packing and Shipping.  I applied for both of them, they pay fairly well which will be good.

----

When applying for the jobs and watching The West Wing, dad brings up the fact that the Mayor and Alderman elections are going to happen in April.  This also sparked my interest.  Should I try and run for Mayor of Versailles.  Our current mayor isn't very smart infact his business is failing and he's going bankrupt, plus he might apply for the County Comissioner's job.  

I don't know what I'm going to do yet, I'm not sure if I want to run for Mayor.  I'd love to win but the main thing is getting involved in the acutal goings on of local government. Having my say, stating my case.  I have alot to offer Versailles including a new outlook as opossed to the stiff starch no nothings running the place now.  I can do good.  More and More I'm thinking of going on Tuesday and signing up to run.  Dad would be so proud.  Dad would love me for it.  He would just be so proud I can't even explain to you how he would feel.

Can you imgine the press coverage, it's always has a big to do when a young person runs for public office.  I think I'm going to do it!"

"event","Well I haven't been saulking like I thought I would. I'm just sitting here chilling, really chilling,  because the heater is still broke.  We got our electric/gas bill and it was $140!!! So the thing is going to stay broke for a while cuz if that thing is putting out that much gas/electricty then I'm screwed and I'll freeze.  I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do when it gets really really REALLY cold.  I hope it won't get very cold at all.

This weekend was odd.  Saturday got pissed away with a nap and Sunday we got the chipper fixed.  It turns out I didn't keep the thing running long enough and a piece of branch was stuck making the whole thing useless.  I'm never going to make that mistake again and anytime something big like that sells I'm going to test it like 10 times before it leaves what makes the whole thing worse is it was my fault. 

After the chipper got finsihed we went to Sedila to get mom her TV.  she ""Didn't know"" that she was getting one even though I told her lol.  We went to K Mart and picked out xmas gifts for my neice and Nephew and then went and got mom's TV.  It's alot like mine execept hers has the speakers on the sides which mikes it look hella cool.  I looked around for a PS2 game but there were really none I wanted so we started home.  We got home and put mom's TV up and got dinner,  I watched Myth Busters which means a good night for me lol

Monday I kinda spent doing nothing. Mom was sick with heart burn I was sitting here all day playing poker and actually making money.  Mom called to tell me that she would have to pay Dish Network $100 to get a reciever in her room.  She told me that Direct TV had a deal going on where we could get 2 TiVo's for free.  I went to town on that.  We had one problem though, Dish said we had a contract for 2 years when mom looked at the contract it said 12 months.  She didn't know what was going on so she brought up the contract and I looked at it, no where did it say 2 years only did it say 12 months so we were fine.  We didn't know if Bigfoot had a diffrent contract so Dad was going to check.  We couldnt' watch Las Vegas cuz there was some dumbass fire in Chicago.  

Yesterday I was in a bad mood for some reason and my dad got the brunt of it.  I called him in the morning and asked if he could call Big Foot to see what the deal is with the contract he rattled off any number of excuses that I could give a shit less about.  We started talking about the heater and got into it a little bit.  When I called mom she didn't sound good at ALL.  She said she was going to make an appointment to go see the Dr.  She called dad and asked him to do ask about the contract and he did it.  That pissed me off cuz he wouldn't do it for me but he'll do it for her. I guess I should be used to it by now but I'm not.  She's at the Dr right now (10:14 Wed) I'm sure we'll have to take her to Jeff to get her stomach probed and what not.  But she's in alot of pain and if that's what she needs we'll surly do it.  

So dad found out Big Foot doesn't have a contract but we want it in writing before we do anything with Direct TV.  I hope it's soon because I love the idea of having a TiVo in my room."

"event","Damn I didn't think I could be so busy for one fricken item lol.  But it's all good, the Fryer went on it's merry way on Friday.  The frieght guy was kind of odd looking and he was man handling that pallet, I thought I was going to throw up watching him force it into place.  Mom, Dad, and I put so much work into getting that thing secured that I thought I was just going to throw up.  Mom had to go back into the shop.  

This weekend was okay, we watched the last race of the year, and to be honest it hasn't sunk in yet that it was in fact the last race of the season.  I don't know when it will or if it will cuz I keep thinking I'll be watchin racing on Sunday and I won't.  Busch won the cup, and Bush Won the White House.  Two bus(c)h's I didn't want to win at all.  Kurt is just a dweeb.  Don't get me wrong he's a wheel man that boy can get it done but it's like he's doing an act everytime he's in front of the camera, which sucks.  It was a damn good race though,  he came thru adversaity to win the cup and I guess he's deserving.

Yesterday we took the cats to the vet to get fixed.  It's an odd thing to do,  take a valued family member to get his balls cut out.  I was sad when we left, I kept thinking that they thought we were going to leave them there and we don't really love them, I know I'm a freak when it comes to that but I really think of my pets as People.  After I got up to the shop I was just so tired I couldn't function, I went home for an early lunch and mom was laying down so I went in my room to watch TV and Passed out.  Not like there was anything going on at the shop anyway it's dead, no one's going to be thinking of doing anything this week.  everyone is thinking about shopping and not selling.  So I slept till 2:30 and mom and I came back  up to the shop to get my car cleaned out cuz it's going to have the Wind Sheild fixed where that rock hit it.  Then we changed the kitty boxes so they would have a fresh place to shit when they got home.  We went to pick them up and Buddy was just kind of Numb and Boomber was really pissy.  He kept hissing till mom took him to the car then he was fine.  They are both doing great now I love them so much they are so sweet.

My new computer is running great.  512 of Ram really makes a diffrence in the performance of a computer.  Things are loading much faster.  My computer has expansion slots for 2 more sticks of RAM so if you think about it I could have over a gig if I wanted to.  now that would rock.

This week is just going to be dead because I'm not going to put anything on over a holiday so it's just kind of a Chill out week and get ready for next week.  I hope people bring some stuff in cuz I have nothing more to put on.

a Fun fact about the end of the season

Busch:

"event","Yesterday was stressful in a way. In another way it was really fun.   Con-Way transport called me to tell me the boxes were on their way.  This made me happier than a little school girl.  I took lunch early cuz she told me they were going to be here in the afternoon.  Mom and I got up here at 12 and loved the cats for a while and then started working.  I started fabricating a peanut dispenser and mom just finshed up cleaning out back.  We were humming along and got the money for the deep fryer transfered into our account.  Then the deepfryer owner came by to see how the auction was going.  Well it was over and I think *think* he's pretty happy with what he got for the fryer, I mean it's more than the opening bid so he damn well should be happy.

Our boxes came at about 2:30  130 boxes is alot esp when alot of them are oversize.  I don't know how we did it but we got them all in the shop. A couple of them are damanged and I'm getting a credit on them.  There were no packing peanuts to speak of so I had to call Uline.  We are waiting till today to find out if it was the shipper or someone at Uline just forgot to put it on our pallet.  We'll see today, if we don't get it today then we'll get a new  bag.  I really wanted that to come today but what ya gonna do?  

The chipper sold for the opening bid price.  I'll be happy to just get rid of it

My new computer is coming on Friday so that's a good thing.  I can't wait to get it cuz this one is great for normal stuff but sucks when it comes to PSP. This computer will be good for mom though.  

Today I have to finish crating the deepfryer and maybe that will go out today, I don't know yet."

"event","Wow, I'm getting really bad at updating,  mainly because I've been working more in the past week.  

Like I said before I'm loaning Auctions Tech 1,500.00 to go for Marketing and supplies we NEED.  We're also going to expand the business from just eBay consignment to Packing and Shipping and eBay tutoring.  This move I hope will get the most out of this store front.  I'm excited about the thought of growing like this. I wanted to do it for a long time but never had the chance to do it.

Yesterday the deep fryer sold for $2053  and it's going to be freighted to WY.  I'm glad it sold for more than the opening bid cuz now the guy that put it on gets more than the opening bid and of course we get more. 

Our load of boxes is coming today via Tractor Trailer.  That makes me happy too!

I'm just really excited about where we're going."

Went home and watched TV all night, that's good to.  Dad brought home a mulcher for us to put on and I think it might actually sell kinda well.  I had a kind of falling out with my parents about the money they owe me.  I wanted to get some boxes from uline but they wouldn't put it on their CC and take that off what they owe me.  so that put me in a bad mood.

Today is going okay, I'm keeping an eye on the car auctions and our auctions.  I have mixed feelings about the cars so we'll see what happens.

I've decided any girl I meet that I like I'm going to take it slow, there's no need to rush anything.  If I really like them for more than their body then I'm going to take it slow, even if they don't want to.  It's the only way to do it.  I've learned from this mistake and I'm not going to repete it."

"event","So this weekend was sort of fun.  Friday afternoon I went and took pictures for 4 cars that I'm going to be putting on for Eldon Ford.  I decdied to wait to do anything with them till Saturday.  Dad's Social Secuirty might be cut off since he still works full time, that would not be so good for us.  I might have to get a job before May to help support the family. They haven't said anything yet but I'll do it if I have to.  The rest of the night we just watched TV.

Saturday I woke up at 10 and just kind of milled around till mom wanted to take a nap, so I went into my room and watched TV in there and promply passed out and slept 3 hours.  3 hours?!?!  I decided I'd do my cars on Sunday.  Watched the Busch race, GO MCMURRARY.  Chilled the rest of the night.

Sunay I woke up and had a cup of joe and came up to the shop to work on the cars to put them on.  One thing I hate about putting cars on is the time it takes to upload 40+ pictures I found myself sitting here for 20 mins just waiting for those to upload.  That's not a fun time at all.  About 12:30 I started uploading the 3rd set of pictures and then went home to mulch the back lawn.  We have 3 huge tree's in our back yard and they drop alot of leaves.  Dad said he was going to help me by blowing the leaves into mower friendly areas.  2 hours later we were done, I didn't expect him to stay out there that long but he stayed out there as long as I did.  We came in and started to watch the race.  It was a good race Jr won so I'm happy.  Busch didn't blow up or spin out or anything so he's still got the points lead.  It's going to take an act of god for him not to win the cup.  I'm loathing watching the banquet if he's the winner, he's going to talk like he always talks and that's just going to suck.  

Came up here after the race to put on the cars but the webhost was down so I couldn't.  Piss on that webhost I hate it.  I'm going to have to put them on today (well tonight)

I wonder how long it's going to be before I have my confindance back about girls, I mean Iwas just getting it back after Sara and now Dana has done gone ruined it for me again.  I wonder how long it will be before I can think that a girl will actually like me.  I've found like 10 girls on Yahoo Personals that I would like to get to know but I can't send them a message, I'm too scared.  

Today I'm going to work on getting those cars on and pack the plates."

So Dana keeps emaling/messaging me just to know whats up and stuff.  I can't see how I can ever be friends with her but I talk to her on the notion that she might wanna hook up again.  I know that's evil of me but what can I say I'm a prick.  I was falling in love with her from the first time we talked.  She was everything good about a girl that I liked.   She broke it off because she had a bad feeling and I guess she just makes snap judgments on her feelings at the time.  I don't know how many times that has happend to me where i have bad feelings but the next day I'm fine.  Everyone has that happen, everyone.  I don't know if she found someone better or something like that but it's pretty much the only way to explain why she broke it off.

Bob called me.  He read my letter about becoming a part time salesmen selling on eBay.  I guess he likes the idea because I'm going over tomorrow to take the first round of pictures.  I don't how many cars I'm going to get or anything like that but we'll see.

I really want to get drunk this weekend but dont' have anyone to drink with me, so I guess I'm stuck not drinking because drinking alone sucks."

She seemed fine last night,  Prolly something I did.  Prolly me being paranoid about her not liking me, she prolly thinks I'm too needy.  Or maybe she misses her Ex I don't know.  

I don't really know, at this second I don't really care.  This is going to haunt me for a while I guess I can take solice in the fact I did her before she broke it off with me.  Nah I can't take solice in that fact, that's going to be the part that haunts me.

EDIT:
You know I really don't understand girls.  If I did understand them I think Mark would have hordes of girls all over us.  Girls just don't want sensitive caring guys, they want the kind that play them and lie to them.  So be it.  I need to focus on the things I'm doing right now anyway instead of worrying about what I'm gonna do with a girl.  I need to focus on Auctions Technology not a girl.  I just don't get them."

&nbsp;Well my date went really well. She's awesome and I think she's
just about as awesome as a girl can get. She's very affectionate, a
great kisser, and is funny. <br>
I hope I didn't fuck it up last night by telling her how freaked out I
was that she wasn't online, it seemed really clingy of me and I'm not
like that at all. I was just a matter of being tired and paranoid. She
said that I fall too fast, I told her I didn't fall for her yet. I
lied. I think so much of her and if she told me she loved me tonight
I'd say it right back. I think she has those feelings for me but just
won't say it. I'm going to try to explain to her all these things, like
I SAY I hope I didn't fuck anything up.

Today was good, Jimmy won the race and HMS needed that. I cried a bit
when him, Jeff, Brian, and Terry were hugging. I haven't been happy all
weekend and I dunno why"

So Dana is gonna come down here tonight and watch a movie at my shop.  I have alot of feelings for her, alot of times I want to write them in here but when I come to write I get tounge tied when I try to type it.  I guess that means the feelings should be just for me, inside.  I know for a fact I'm falling in love with her.  I want to do it right however and ""Court"" her.  She's just so awesome.  She couldn't be more perfect."

"event","Talked to Dana on the phone last night....and into this morning.  She's got a hella sexy voice, she's got a way of letting out a soft grunt/moan  that just gets me going.  We could be talking about toxic waste and I'd be turned on.  We talked for about 4 hours.  She's got this dry sence of humor and she likes to tease me about everything.  I guess that means she's open with me and that's great.

One thing I didn't like is that I talked wayyyyyy to much, she had alot of ""Uh huh"" ""Right"" ""Yeah""  I couldn't stop talking about my family, my pets, racing, and how sexy she is.  I just talked wayyyy to much.

I can't wait till friday, now the normal new realtionship jitters comes in to play: is she gonna like me when she sees me?  Is she gonna be nice?  all that shit is going on in my head right now.  This is too good pass up though.

A week till the election, I'm excited about voting.  I have a bad feeling Kerry won't win,  but he'll still get my vote.  I'll be happy when the election is over either way.  

oh yeah one more thing:

GO SOX"

"event","This weekend was great till the end of the race.  
Friday night I talked with Dana for about 4 hours, it was great.  I like her alot and can't wait to see her.

Saturday I watched the truck race and the end of the busch race. Then watched game one of the world series. GO SOX.

Sunday I watched the race. It was good till the end when they annouced a HMS plane went down killing 10 including Ricky and John Hendrick.  Ricky was only 24, close enough to my age to make me sad.

so anyway.  Dana is awesome."

"event","Today was good, it started at 2 am when I finally said good night to Dana(not by choice if I didn't I would have slept on this computer)

I had a hard time going to sleep this morning, I was thinking about Dana.  I have yet to see anything about her that I don't like.  I'm really nervous about meeting her mainly because I think the same thing will happen that happend with Sara, I think she'll see me and think of me as a skank or something like that. I hope not cuz I REALLY like her. She's into the same things as me (aside from racing).  She likes to stay at home rather than going out which is cool.  She has a great sence of humor, which is really important to me.  She's overall cool.  

She asked me out on a date the other night which was a first for me. I've never had a girl ask me out on a date.  She really wants to go out so that's cool.  She works for the state and that's cool too.  She doesn't live at home so I don't have to meet the parents right off.  I can't wait to see her, which is going to happen next Saturday, I'm gonna goto her place and watch DVD's."

"event","So yesterday was spent shopping for food and being pensive about the guy with the trains coming in.  I left early in the hopes of avoiding him and getting home to watch The West Wing.

I saw the new Mustang over at the dealership, hella nice.  even mom likes them, they look like the 1970's Stang.

The Train guy came in today and bitched me out about how he wouldn't have let them go for that price. He was lucky to get rid of them if you ask me.  He got $114 for 3 POS trains and an old indian rag.  He did good.  He took the rest of his stuff.  Good riddance.

Last night a girl messaged me from my Yahoo Personal. Seems we talked before and didn't click (I think I was still getting ready to move into the shop and wasn't really ready for a realtionship.  She's really cute and lives in Jeff City.  She's funny and likes to laugh so I think we'll click good.  She asked me out, which for me is a first.   I have never been asked out before in my life, I don't even count  any of the times I've went out as dates...We've been emailing all day, she works for the state so she can't IM.  But we've been emailing, I gotta admit when I see the mail notifaction I get hella excited.  I can't wait to meet this girl.  Have I mentioned she's HELLA Cute?"

"event","ugh bad morning so far.
The barnyard plates buyer has filed a pay pal claim to get a FULL refund.  Yeah thats right.  He wants me to refund the purchase price, the shipping there and the shipping back.  I don't see where that's my problem.  Wal-Mart doesn't compensate your gas money when you return an item.  Plus my Terms of Sale are pretty clear. so piss on them...but now the case in the hands of some yahoo at Pay Pal.

AND

The train set guy called me this morning to tell me not to put any of his other items on ""I'm so disapointed with the prices I got, I guess I learned a lession not to use your services anymore.""
See this argument I don't get,  It's an AUCTION.  There is no gurantee what anything is going to bring.  The 2 engines went for over 70 dollars!  That's damn good if you ask me.  The Caboose went for $40.  The Whimsy (or as Mark calls it 'The Worthless indian Rag') went for $44  He got just under $100.  The trains were not in good shape either,  there was rust.  People think their items are worth gold when they are really worth just shit."

"event","Back!&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thought I'd post a quick...erm...post about what's been going on with me.

I'm back off to Japan in 2 weeks....not to study this time, though.&nbsp; I'll be working!&nbsp; I'm excited that I don't have to jump between countries anymore just because of school.

Again, I usually use Myspace, so hit me up on there if you can.

I'll try to start posting here more often!&nbsp; I just gotta pretty it up a bit...."

"event","I haven't written in here in awhile.  I'll type up something quick.  Well, I've been playing FFVII a little bit today and I really forgot how much I enjoyed that game.  I really can't wait for FFXII.  Good times.

What else?  Nothing much.  Check out www.joshinthe.net for real updated and pictures from Japan.  I'm gettin ready to go downstairs and maybe get some food.  I've been in my room on the game for the past couple of hours.  

later."

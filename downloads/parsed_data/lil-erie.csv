"event","yep, so i'm back from the dead...or boot camp whatever you want to call it. it was a long good experience, i'm so glad i went through with it. i guess some things have happened since i've last updated... i got my own place, still in butler i'm engaged and maybe just maybe expecting a bundle of joy. i might be moving to new jersey, but i'm not sure yet. ken and i are no longer an item. he's still in iraq. we've remained good friends since we've broken up. it's just too hard to have a long distance relationship with someone like that so far away. we've actually argued quite a bit. he was/is too stressed over there to maintain such a new relationship. at the time we were talking about getting back together once he came back, but we BOTH decided to hold off and see how we feel once he comes home, which won't be for another 6 months atleast. also...the little bundle of joy i'm expecting...yeah not quite sure if he's the father or not...but that's all i have to say about that situation, and i'll now return to my private life. 

okay so i feel like including my list of things i want to do before i expire...
1. see every state and us terrority
2. be deployed
3. get married
4. have kids
5. get a good job
6. finish college
7. buy a brand new car
8. do something completely self-less
9. volunteer my time for something great
10. save someone"

<P>well i come online today to find out that my baby had a conversation with my gram. he was so respectful to her, what he didn't know was that she saved the conversation to show me. if there was ever any doubt in my mind, it's gone after seeing what he said about me. even if his duty tour got extended, we're still going to try to get married when he comes home, and eventually start our family. :) me with a baby... oh well, i have things to do... later ya'll</P>"

"event","<P>my christmas was awesome! i got myself a new camcorder, some clothes, 2 pretty crosses, and my new fantastic coat! there was only one thing missing...HIM! i miss him like crazy, and i'm going to miss him even more when i'm gone. i got my hair cut...it looks cute, even though it's short and i took my pregnency test today. but other than that everything is boring!</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""click here for a look back""> </P>
<P>well i'm getting close...only 6 days. i honestly remember the day i enlisted. it doesn't seem that long ago, now i'm about to leave my friends and family behind. not all of them understand why i'm choosing to do this. some of them just won't understand at all... i'm not going to regret joining the air force, even if i grow to hate it. even then, i will still be able to say proudly that i completed something only a tiny fraction of people, especially women, can do. people ask me if i'm nervous...OF COURSE, why wouldn't i be nervous? i'm leaving my comfort zone of friends and family so i can get yelled at by an instructer because every little thing i do and say is wrong. my parents keep telling me that i can change my mind, that i don't have to go. i know i don't have to...but i want to. this has been my dream since i was practically a baby. every generation in my family has had someone in the military. i get the honor of breaking that tradition, by being the first female in my family to join. i've gotten nothing but tons of love and support from the people that matter most to me. even when i've thought about giving up and backing out, they talked me out of it. for that i will be eternally greatful. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>someone once told me that you get only one guardian angel. now this is going to sound silly, but he was wrong. i won't go into too much detail, but lets just say that i know that i have multiple angels here, and waiting for me in heaven. now before this turns into a sappy little post going into too much emotion, let me just say that i will miss all of you. even the people that i know only through my lj. take care of yourselfs, as i will take care of myself to the best of my ability. in a year from now, who knows where any of us will be...i just hope that by this time next year everyone will be safe from harm...ok that's enough now... i'm going to lay down.. good night everyone *muah*</P>"

<P>i have to take my pregnency test next tuesday, i'm pretty sure i have nothing to worry about! damnit, now this shit with him is goign to be on my mind until i talk to him again, which who knows when that will be considering he didn't get on last night like he usually does. damnit now i'm getting pissed!<BR></P>"

i'm getting scared. part of me isn't sure i'm ready for this whole boot camp thing. i'm not going to back out of it. it is what i want. it's just going to  be hard going though all that mental/physical challenge without any loved ones around me at all. i know they will all be with me in spirit. i do want to take a moment to say thank you to all my friends who have been there for me over the years. the ones that have put up with all of my b.s. i wouldn't be the person i am today, without you guys. well i guess i should get back to my homework. goodbye ya'll! i have 35 days left... so i better hear from all of you before then!"

"event","im almost flattered by this guy at work. he walked by my department while i was helping an older couple pick out a watch. well, after this guy winked and me and kind of said something (i think he said ""hey cutie"" but i couldn't hear him) anyway, while he was so obviously checking me out, he walked right into a cart. the cart not only hit a display, nearly knocking it over, but he also walked into Chad and Christina. too bad they walked away shortly before he came back. yes he came back! keep in mind i'm still helping this older couple. well i glance over to let him know that i'll be with him in a second (i have to greet every customer or i'll get in trouble) so i go back to this older couple. they just can't decide what they want, so they tell me to help this kid. so i go over and ask him if i can help him with anything, and he proceeds to ask me about a watch. the question made no sense, i could tell he just made it up. so anyway here's how the rest of our conversation went:

weird guy: so uh, i have my own apartment, my roommate just moved out, and he owed me money so he just gave me his watch. i really don't like it and want to sell it, do you know how much it's worth?

me: it's a bulova, im not sure how much you'll get.

weird guy: well, nah i really didn't want to ask about the watch...i'm seth, what's your name?

me: *points to my name badge* erinn

weird guy: i'm 25 how old are you? * keep in mind, he looks like he's 30 easily, maybe older*

me: i'm only 19.

weird guy: so uh, you single? you cute.

me: thanks, but sorry, i'm not looking for anyone right now.

weird guy: ah i see, well uh, you change your mind...i'll b back

and with that he walked away. he did come back shortly there after to ""double check that i wasn't looking""

i couldn't help but laugh, and be a little flattered. cindy and lisa got a good laugh out of that. and i also had a 4 man escort out to my car. i had 2 guys from seasonal, 1 from maintence, and 1 from pets. i found that to be amusing. my big protectors. well, im gonna get back to doing actual work, i just wanted to share. :)

Well she seemed all right by dawns early light 
Though she looked a little worried and week 
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again 
But daddy left the proof on her cheek 
And I was only eight years old that summer 
And I always seemed to be in the way 
So I took myself down to the fair in town 
On Independence Day 

Well word gets around in a small, small town 
They said he was a dangerous man 
But mama was proud and she stood her ground 
She knew she was on the losin' end 
Some folks whispered and some folks talked 
But everybody looked the other way 
And when time ran out there was no one about 
On Independence Day 

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing 
Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning 
Let the week be strong, let the right be wrong 
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay it's Independence Day 

Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July 
By the time that the firemen come 
They just put out the flames, and took down some names 
And sent me to the county home 
Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong 
But maybe its the only way 
Talk about your revolution 
It's Independence Day 

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing 
Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning 
Let the week be strong, let the right be wrong 
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay it's Independence Day 
Roll the stone away 
It's Independence day 


i'm thinking of you..."

but that doesn't mean i don't think of you
i tried moving on, but it doesn't work
i need the one who always knew
how to treat a lady.
i can't explain how i felt when i saw you the other day
but i would give everything to again feel that way
i can't live my life without you in it.
even if we're only friends
even though you think i'm the worst,
why do i always feel like i'm cursed
you're gonna move on and find that perfect girl.
while i end up all alone in my own little world
i could never tell you any of this in person.
because i know how much of a chicken i am.
i thought i could get past those feelings i had,
but they all came back when i saw you walking through the door.
good luck with life, even though i know you won't need it....
just do me a favor.....

It seemed like I have so much homework to do and not enough time to do it in! I gave my presentation for speech today, I don't think it went too bad. Andrew keeps calling me and it's really bugging me. The more I think about it, the more I really don't want to talk to him. He's too much to handle, he reminds me of someone else and I don't want to think about him! And no, it's not who you are probably thinking of! He called me about 20 times in the past 45 minutes. He really got to me today, first I was talking about how my car needs new shocks, so what does he do? He climbs in top of my car and starts bouncing on it. Then we're sitting in his truck on our break between classes and he starts to get all close to me, which I'm the type of person where if I don't want to be touched I will make it known, and I did today. But of course that didn't stop him! I wanted to just start screaming at him, but I just kept it inside and told him I was leaving. It just bugs me that he always has to be around. He waits for me after my 2 o'clock class on tuesday and thursday. I tried explaining to him, that on my days off, I like to get home asap so I can finish up on homework/reading and relax, b/c i don't get too anymore. He bought me flowers yesterday, which is all fine and good but he kept trying to kiss me while I was at work. Now that really pissed me off b/c we work together, and he knows that if my manager would have saw that, I would have gotten in trouble! I really think he just looks for reasons to get me yelled at! Why won't he just leave me alone!?!?! Anyway other than that, my day was fine. I think I spotted Tyler walking across the parking lot today. I would have went over to talk to him, but you know who was practically glued to my side! Oh well, I better go. I still have work to do! Later ya'll!"

i got a new job. well not quite i still work at wal mart, i just work in the jewelry department now. it's twenty cents more an hour and i don't have to deal with as many customers as i do when i'm cashiering.

"event","i got home from work about an hour ago, and i'm exhausted. buti figured i would give a quick update before bed. 1. i hate working at kings! 2. i'm slowly realizing that i don't really know who i am as a person. i really thought i did. but i don't. i think i need just a little vacation by myself. i think i just need to clear my head and realize what i truely want out of life. but for now i want sleep. so i'm going to bed. good night ya'll!"

Sometimes, after a bully had smashed his face into concrete or nearly cracked one of his ribs, the smell of dime-store whiskey would be the first kick to his senses when he came to, along with that tiny, secret pang in his chest (of relief? humiliation?) as Bucky cradled the back of his head, lifting it up so Steve could swallow right.</p><p style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.454545021057129px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">(There were many, many people who&#39;d say James Barnes just didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; gentle, for all his smirking charm and cold, sharp sniping skills, and they&#39;d never know not a word of it was true.)</p><p style=""border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.454545021057129px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&quot;I don&#39;t even really remember what it feels like,&quot; Steve said, and it wasn&#39;t even a lie.

Non-angst fic, no less.<br /><br />Dedicated to the forever lovely <lj user=""buzzardhula"" />, who hath commanded me to write said non-angst.&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Title:</b> <i>Blood on Lines Crossed</i><br /><b>Fandom:</b> The Avengers (2012)<br /><b>Rating:</b> T for sex talk and ridiculousness<br />Characters/Pairing: Clint Barton/Natasha Romanov<br /><b>Genre: </b>Fluff<br /><b>Summary:</b> <i>They&#39;re creatures of routine.&nbsp;</i><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&quot;Fury got you knocking heads tonight?&quot;""><br /><br /><p>Clint&#39;s a careless douche when he can afford to be, but somehow he knows from the start that all of Natasha&#39;s cosmetics go beyond hideously expensive when they don&#39;t need to be. Technically, he doesn&#39;t need to be here either; her nails are going to turn out perfect no matter who does them since that&#39;s just the way it goes. But he&#39;d had enough of training and lounging and tinkering with his new(er) explosive arrows three hours ago, and his brushstrokes are always as neat as the shots he puts through people&#39;s eyes.</p><p>He would call it a gift, but really, he&#39;s just had a lot of practice.</p><p>&quot;Spill it and die,&quot; she warns him anyway. He can&#39;t see her face from behind her issue of&nbsp;<em>Vogue</em>, but all these years of knowing her would be for shit if he&nbsp;<em>couldn&#39;t</em>&nbsp;tell that she&#39;s raising her eyebrow at him regardless. The magazine&#39;s a year old and Natasha knows nearly every word and picture by heart, but it&#39;s good for hiding the way her lips twitch when he blows on her big toe in response, pretending to accidentally brush a finger across the ball of her ticklish foot.</p><p>He&#39;s not past spilling the polish just to spite her, she knows, just a drop on her bedroom carpet here and there, but he never has.</p><p>The color&#39;s like blood, of course. As red as her lips and their ledgers, or so they&#39;d call it if they were feeling melodramatic enough. But today&#39;s just a Tuesday and he isn&#39;t Hawkeye and she&#39;s not the Black Widow, so the color&#39;s just red even thought the bottle reads &quot;Ruby Clarity&quot;, because there was something liberating about not having to read into the details.</p><p>&quot;You still haven&#39;t paid me back for doing this so damn much, Nat...&quot; he grumbles, even though he absolutely knows that getting to call her Nat is his reward. Tony ended up limping for a week when he tried calling her that in the training ring that one time.</p><p>&quot;Getting to spend time in my presence isn&#39;t enough?&quot; She flips a page of her magazine. &quot;Also, sex is for weekends.&quot;</p><p>This time, she doesn&#39;t even need to see him to know he&#39;s pouting.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, but technically head-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is for Fridays. And I hope you mean&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;head, because your head is whenever I feel like it. Which could be in two months or maybe fifteen minutes, but don&#39;t get your hopes up.&quot;</p><p>And then he&#39;s grinning like he&#39;s won, she knows.</p><p>&quot;I always mean your head, Nat.&quot;</p><p>Natasha considers shoving one of her freshly painted toes in his mouth, just for the way he says that, but Clint&#39;s kinky, the bastard, so he&#39;d probably start sucking on it or something nasty and the head thing would become more than just banter. Instead, she inhales and shifts on the edge of her half-made bed, turning her right ankle so he can get at her middle toe better.</p><p>&quot;Back to work,&quot; she orders, and he obeys.</p><p>It stays like that, for a while, with him concentrating like he&#39;s doing something far more worthy than painting nails and her trying to focus on Vogue, on the pictures and text and not the cool of the polish seeping through into her skin or the way his callused fingers feel on her feet and huh, she might just have to goad him into a massage, later.</p><p>He&#39;s just finished both of her feet when it occurs to her that they&#39;re possibly having a&nbsp;<em>moment</em>&nbsp;or leading up to one, and the fact that she&#39;s&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>scared that they&#39;re having moments more and more often these days actually... scares her. Love&#39;s for children, and Clint is one (<em>and maybe she is too, because what else would you call what they&#39;re doing now?</em>), but it&#39;s easy to ignore when Natasha&#39;s not being directly confronted with&nbsp;<em>moments</em>.</p><p>Otherwise? Sex might be a friends with benefits thing and they just don&#39;t talk about the cuddling, but they still have lines to cross on love, and&nbsp;<em>moments&nbsp;</em>are those times when it looks like he might take the leap. And somehow Natasha knows (<em>she always just knows</em>) deep inside that he&#39;ll never speak the three magic words, when that time comes, but whatever it is, whatever he does, it&#39;ll show it well enough.</p><p>He&#39;ll definitely be the one to close that distance, too, since she&#39;s always been the smart one.</p><p>The magazine&#39;s holding on to her interest by a thread, but she flips the page and scans the fashion tip columns anyway. Her thoughts are more than enough to get lost in now, something she only saves for days like unimportant Tuesdays, and the moment he takes her left hand and starts polishing is the moment her eyes catch the word &quot;summer&quot; on the page and then she remembers how this happened. All of it, the origin of this routine of theirs, this thing that they do and forget about until they do it again (<em>like sex like training like missions like everything</em>).</p><p>The first time he&#39;d done this had been in the summer, down in lovely Buenos Aires where the mission was to slip a little dissolving pill into a drug lord&#39;s champagne at some party. As the display piece (<em>always a display</em>) the Black Widow been the one to actually do it while Hawkeye watched from the air vents, of course, and it had been so blazing that going in close-toed shoes would have brought on more stares than she needed. And somehow, sometime, somewhere in a cramped little hotel, she found herself curling her hair and smoothing her lips with gloss as he gently blew on her feet like now. A moment, just one, wedged somewhere between a million other moments she couldn&#39;t keep track of, but a moment nonetheless.</p><p>To save time, they&#39;d agreed.</p><p>And it had, cutting a clean ten minutes from their preparation and getting them out of Buenos Aires within three hours, which has got to be some sort of record, all things considered. How it had stopped being only a time-saver and started being&nbsp;<em>this</em>, though, she can&#39;t even begin to recall. It just... happened.</p><p>Like lots of things happen, Natasha guesses. Like training, like missions, like sex. Like the way Clint&#39;s hand lingers a bit too long on her left one before releasing. Like the way he seems to summon a misguided boldness as he takes her right hand, ghosting his lips over her knuckles before the red soaked brush comes down on her again. Like how she just goes ahead and lets him do it.</p><p>Natasha is the Black Widow when she lowers her magazine, her face revealing nothing, but she nearly falters when she sees Hawkeye looking back at her, his face revealing nothing and everything, and she should be making an offhand comment about him really being horny right now.</p><p>Except she doesn&#39;t.</p><p>They look at each other for the first time in an hour, one moment wedged in many.</p><p>&quot;Fury got you knocking heads tonight?&quot; He knows the answer is no, but that&#39;s not the point. Smirking, the Black Widow retreats to spin her web and sleep for the night, leaving just Natasha to meet just Clint halfway because all of a sudden things are easy again.</p><p>&quot;They tell me New York has good pizza,&quot; she says.</p><p>&quot;Wow. Pizza? You must be sick of shawarma.&quot;</p><p>The nails on her left hand are dry enough, she thinks. Natasha reaches and tangles her fingers in his hair for a moment before pulling away.</p><p>&quot;Just the word makes me nauseous. Now I need alcohol to forget,&quot; she smiles, and then takes a leap. &quot;But if you don&#39;t finish with that polish and distract me with head in the next five minutes, I&#39;m going to be too sick to go out.&quot;</p><p>To his credit, he does both in three.</p><br /></lj-cut><br /><p></p>"

"event","<p>And I&#39;m too lazy to write a book on it. But I will do what I hope is a decent review!<br /><br /><b>With no spoilers! :D&nbsp;</b><br /></p><br /><lj-cut text=""Are we really that surprised?""><br /><p>I&#39;m sure you might have guessed by now that my opinion may or may not reflect what everyone else has already said about this movie. And to an extent... it does. It has it&#39;s good points, but still, this is not what you would call a &quot;good&quot; movie. At the best it&#39;s average. I&#39;m right fresh off seeing it, and words cannot describe how underwhelmed I feel.<br /><br />And -- wait for it -- I even feel underwhelmed with what they did with the Once-ler. My online experience for the past week has been me gawking at his growing cult of fans. There are hundreds of them! The way they were describing him and worshiping him made me think I was going to be super invested in his parts. Don&#39;t get me wrong, he&#39;s still the best part of the movie by far... but I was expecting him to <i>save</i> the movie.<br /><br />Which he does not. And and the reason he doesn&#39;t save the movie is because there isn&#39;t more of him. I mean, his character wasn&#39;t outright wasted. He&#39;s adorkable. He&#39;s likable. You hate that he becomes what he becomes. He had the best lines, the best moments, you know the drill.<br /><br />But just like everyone else, I think it would have been monumentally better if they had just kept to his storyline, with Ted being an audience surrogate like he was in the books. But this is a modern day reboot, so of course the kid has to be the main protagonist and he has to have his backstory. Granted, I do kind of like the idea behind Thneedville becoming this fake-ass town made of plastic where everyone lives in blissful ignorance, it&#39;s just that they never expand on it. The town just kind of... exists. I know Thneedville is not the most original idea (<i>WALL-E</i>&nbsp;and countless other stories anyone?), but I&#39;m not looking for originality. I&#39;m looking for a movie that draws me in and keeps me there.&nbsp;<br /><br />And that&#39;s why <i>The Lorax</i> is not that good. The Once-ler and his parts are just kind of there. The kid is just kind of there. The horrible cardboard cutout villain O&#39;Hare is there. The Lorax is there. The little animal things are there. The music is there. The message is there. (Special mention for flatness goes to the humor. Joke after joke kept on falling flat.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything&#39;s there, but very little sticks.&nbsp;Other than maybe the Once-ler (and I have to admit, even that&#39;s kind of stretching it for me at this point), no part of it had a chance to impact me.</p><p>What gets me the most is that this movie <i>did not have to be bad</i>. It&#39;s one big &quot;could-have&quot;. It could have really gone deep with the Once-ler&#39;s story and made him from a good character to an awesome character. Hell, they could have done Ted&#39;s story a whole lot better, if the writers had really wanted to. It&#39;s just that everything was so rushed, so poorly paced that it all came out even more flat and boring than I was expecting.<i> The Lorax</i> has no soul to it. It&#39;s all fantastic animation and one silly, memorable character but lacks the depth it needs to last.&nbsp;<br /><br />And of course, even though they do address the one problem I had with the original (the fact that nobody ever thinks just to pluck the foliage from the trees), the traditional cartoon is still better, being as ancient as it is. It took the time to let the story breathe. It didn&#39;t feel the need to switch back and forth between plot lines or rely on spectacle or anything.<br /><br />Personally, I could care less that they rebooted the Once-ler completely to try and make him more sympathetic and attractive. It worked, but just enough to get by. If only someone had just thought to focus the whole movie on him and the Lorax. If only someone had thought to explore their relationship a bit more. There&#39;s no emotional connection. It&#39;s just a moving picture on a screen.</p></lj-cut><br /><p>TL;DR 6/10 (it would be five out of ten without the Once-ler&#39;s green pimp suite). In terms of rebooting Dr. Seuss movies,&nbsp;<i>Horton Hears a Who</i>&nbsp;was a whole lot better. Hopefully, future reboots of his work will be more like that one.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:smaller;"">Oh, and by the way, Universal is already mulling over doing a sequel! Shame? What in the world is shame?</span></p>"

I see a post and click on the user and suddenly<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:xx-large;""><i>HOW BA-AH-AH-AD CAN I BE</i>&nbsp;</span><br /><br />blasting on my computer.<br /><br />Now I know what it sounds like. I wasn&#39;t planning on getting spoiled for any of the songs for <i>The Lorax</i> until I watched the movie, Tumblr. I already got spoiled for everything else. Thank you, Tumblr.&nbsp;<br /><br />But anyway all the Once-ler love on my dash is making me nostalgic for the <i>Horton Hears a Who</i> fandom on deviantART. Which makes me feel old. Oh, and speaking of the Once-ler, fuck you Hollywood for his design. You knew exactly what you were doing when you rebooted his character and damn it I know I&#39;m going to fall for it really hard once I see the movie just like every other teen girl in existence. It&#39;s only a matter of time. It&#39;s already started. The whole fandom&#39;s like a cult for just him. Nobody gives a shit about the other characters and it&#39;s both hilarious and kinda scary at the same time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Personally, I can&#39;t wait till they do the exact same thing with<i> The Sneetches </i>or something.

Other than the fact that it completely fails at being a laptop because of it&#39;s non-portability, being ten pounds and all, it has actually served me well. Y&#39;know, since I was still in little league soccer on Saturdays. Since I was in the fifth grade. Since before Obama was elected or anybody even knew who he was. Since before Angry Birds. Since before a whole lot of things I&#39;ve had my laptop.<br /><br />This thing has had its screen replaced. It&#39;s had its its hard drive replaced. It&#39;s been scratched and banged and it went through a phase where it overheated multiple times a day. But through all that, it&#39;s worked consistently well. It&#39;s very fast for its age, but I think it&#39;s time to retire it before it gets ornery and old on me and becomes suicidal.<br /><br />SO, FLIST. Tell me, what would you recommend me when it comes to buying a new laptop? Any sellers I should look into? Also, please tell me if there are places out there you&#39;ve had bad experiences at so I can avoid them. Any models I should look into? Any feedback is appreciated?<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;m looking for a laptop that:<br /><br />-is portable. Please nothing heavy. I have arms like twigs and I want a laptop that I can easily take away from my desk to my bed/to the car/to school/whatever.&nbsp;<br />-has a genuinely decent battery that won&#39;t die thirty minutes after being unplugged.<br />-Is fast and has a good looking, decent sized screen. I don&#39;t need a super powerful gaming type computer like that massive desktop my brother has in his room, but I at least want something I can play Portal 1 and 2 on in my spare time and watch movies on.<br />-Has technology that will keep it from overheating and possibly setting itself/me/any paper in close proximity on fire.&nbsp;<br />-Did I mention good battery life? Because that&#39;s kind of important.<br /><br />Anything that fits into those specifications and doesn&#39;t look like something my dad would cart around is a-okay with me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now watch me never get a new laptop again because I&#39;m so picky.&nbsp;"

Or someone sneaking a hand on a part of your body they shouldn&#39;t have and leaving you to die a little later? Or something, anything, whatever horrible thing that happened to you that made your soul come to this world as a... punishment? Reward?</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Most who come here don&#39;t figure that last thing out until it&#39;s too late, but during the collapse it hardly matters, because the most important thing right then is, depending on who you are, either sobbing or hating yourself for sobbing. For most. It&#39;s five minutes. An hour. A day, at the longest, before they break. It comes when everything&#39;s still fresh and the danger of forgetting all over again (which is more possible than anyone knows) is the furthest thing from your mind. That is, if you&#39;re most people.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">So Otonashi must not be most people, then.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Oh, the breakdown happens. It happens harder than he ever thought it could be, but it&#39;s just short of two weeks after a vision of the little sister he killed trying to make happy came to him for the first time (or rather, came back). There had been pain, sure, when he first remembered. It was enough to make him want to scream how unfair it was into the heavens, but not this. Nothing like this.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">He could feel it coming too, starting out as a dull ache in his middle a few minutes ago after the last SSS meeting of the day, as he took a bite of a strawberry snack cake from a vending machine. It hadn&#39;t meant anything up until he tasted it, but then it&nbsp;<i><i>did</i></i>, because there, right in front of him, was a little, redheaded girl who&nbsp;<i><i>wasn&#39;t</i></i>&nbsp;laid up in a hospital bed just yet gulping down half of one and offering him the rest.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Something inside tells him to push the thoughts aside, that wallowing in misery would only make the others annoyed, that the cake will only make him sick if he tries to force himself to eat it, but he doesn&#39;t listen. Instead, he swallows it like a normal person (or someone desperately faking it) and his legs start moving, carrying him away from the dorms. The plastic-wrapped cake stays clutched firmly in his hand, just on the edge of being crushed.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Two minutes of walking later, he stops and looks behind him, blinking at the setting sun and the shadowed outlines of campus buildings like he hadn&#39;t just been in control of his actions the whole journey, like he doesn&#39;t know why he&#39;s here, on some random bridge far away from everyone.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">He does know, though. It&#39;s not at the forefront of his mind (planning out how he&#39;s going to let himself go feels wrong), but on some level of conciousness he&#39;s well aware of what this is, so he finds a nearby bench, sits, and thinks.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">From then on, it doesn&#39;t take him long. Soon, he can nearly feel the weight of his sister&#39;s hand in his instead of the treat, can see her giggling about a teen magazine with the latest boy band on the cover displayed in a shop window, can see her still body lying at rest right before they slid her into a fire, can see just a split second of her pale skin turning to ash. The doctor himself paid for a nice little urn, Otonashi remembers, and they, plus a couple of nurses, drove out to the sea and let her fly away there.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">And then, as those last visions assault him and he tries his hardest not to crush the cake in his grip, he finally feels it. That awful, horrible feeling of longing, of wanting to talk to somebody who doesn&#39;t exist anymore, who will never talk or smile or get excited at a new issue of their favorite magazine ever again. For the first time in this life, Otonashi truly&nbsp;<i><i>misses</i></i>&nbsp;his sister, and wishes, with all his being, that he could just share one more strawberry snack cake with her. She liked those more than he did. She liked everything more than he did, and she was the one who had it hard.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">And he never got to help her, or even make her proud. She&#39;s not here, and deep inside, Otonashi knows she never will be.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">He doesn&#39;t drop the cake, just sets it gently beside him. It shouldn&#39;t have to suffer like he does. No one, nothing should suffer like he does or his sister did, except maybe the God who condemned them all to a horrible life and then sent them here.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">That&#39;s what Yurippe thinks, at least. But really, not even then.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">He goes even furthur than simply ignoring the concerned, all too familiar voice (who is he kidding, he knows exactly who it is) calling his name in the distance, telling himself that there&#39;s no one there at all as he coughs out sob after sob into his sweaty right hand. Not even when he hears slow, measured footsteps very clearly does he look up, which is a mistake because suddenly he has another vision, one that he knows is just imagination, of a big brother piggybacking his little sister to a carnival or a movie or a Christmas tree display. Only this time, she&#39;s grasping his shoulders in excitement as she looks around, alert and alive, with decades of happiness ahead of her instead of an hour.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">&quot;Otonashi? Jesus, man...&quot;</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Otonashi tries scrubbing at his eyes with the back of his sleeve when Hinata sits on the bench, but that only makes them irritated all over again. And holding his breath to quiet his crying only makes him feel like he&#39;s drowning.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">To top if off, Hinata is completely still beside him like he just came here to watch, and for some reason it makes Otonashi feel weak and emotionally naked, which does not help at all. Willing Hinata to go away makes him feel even worse, so for the whole period of silence between them Otonashi finds himself wanting to disappear. Obliterate himself, as they all call it. Anything,&nbsp;<i><i>anything</i></i>&nbsp;to escape what he feels now, damn cowardice and damn the consequences.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">While time drags on and his attemps to stop crying completely fail over and over, some stupid part of Otonashi manages to convince him that Hinata will keep his hands to himself, but that&#39;s bullshit, almost ridiculous enough to make him start laughing through his tears.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">And to tell the truth, it isn&#39;t all that unwelcome when he feels the other&#39;s arm curl around his back, anchoring him to whatever reality this is, warming him up against the chilled evening air (jeez, he hasn&#39;t even been aware of his own shivering until now, he&#39;s so far gone).</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; Hinata&#39;s curls his fingers around Otonashi&#39;s own hand and draws it away from his puffy, reddened eyes, and when Otonashi opens them at last, the look on Hinata&#39;s face makes him want to punch him because how dare he. How dare he smile. How dare he look so calm and patient through this. That&#39;s Otonashi&#39;s job, he decides right then. It&#39;s his duty to comfort and help everyone else like he had helped Naoi, like he hadn&#39;t helped his sister. Not the other way around. Not when he&#39;d never been touched like this in his previous life, save for his sister&#39;s doctor putting a hand on his back at the funeral or one of the nurses gently clasping his hand as they took the little girl who&#39;d meant the world to him away with her face covered by a blanket.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Another sob claws at his throat (out of frustration, anger, other emotions that just hold people back and get nothing done), and he has no choice but to let it go. And he must let the rest of him go at the same time, too, since he catches himself actually&nbsp;<i><i>reaching</i></i>&nbsp;for Hinata in the next second. Like the child he never got to be.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Grimacing, he tries to pull back, but by then it&#39;s already too late.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">&quot;Oh, no you don&#39;t,&quot; says Hinata. &quot;C&#39;mere.&quot; He embraces Otonashi like it&#39;s the easiest thing in the world, pressing his friend&#39;s head to his shoulder, running his hand over his friend&#39;s hair and neck and back, making everything better and worse all at once.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">&quot;It&#39;s okay, man. I know.&quot; In a fit of immaturity, Otonashi wants to call him out on that, but he knows it&#39;s true. If he didn&#39;t know, he wouldn&#39;t be here.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">It&#39;s a disgusting, selfish thing to think, but Otonashi&#39;s glad Hinata&#39;s here. And him leaving anytime soon is a scary idea, somehow, so he shows as much by clutching at the other&#39;s shirt and holding on as he breaks down.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">Some time later, like all things, his tears eventually stop and so does his shuddering, thank God, but when he tries to move away (suddenly remembering what dignity is), Hinata pulls him closer still.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">&quot;Relax, dude.

There was one time in the dead of night, when she had slept in Morgana&#39;s antechamber because her nightmares were at their worst, that she&#39;d heard a strangled, badly concealed moan from the other room and rushed in to find her lady in a situation that would have Gwen copying her every night for a week.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">It wasn&#39;t those things at all, not to mention the many more whispered words and impure thoughts better left locked away in some dusty corner of her mind.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">It was just... the big realization &ndash; or better yet, reminder &ndash; that she had never actually <i>done</i> <i>it</i> came crashing down like falling rocks just as Lancelot&#39;s lips crashed down on her neck and the blushing teenage girl inside tittered that she had never been kissed there before.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">Later, she&#39;d blame her embarrassing squeak on the fact that the whole thing had started as a conversation.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">The sun had been due to set early today, but Merlin still had two hours left in the stocks, so Lancelot, saint that he was, had offered up himself to brush Arthur&#39;s horse along with his own like Merlin had been ordered to do before he&#39;d gotten himself into trouble somehow. Surely one task completed for Merlin out of the thousand others given might keep the Crown Princess from having another hissy fit for a while and give said manservant a good five minutes of rest, he&#39;d joked at her as she&#39;d passed by. Startled (because really, that was more something <i>Gwaine</i> would say), she&#39;d laughed and laughed and they&#39;d gone from there, both pleasantly tired and free from obligations for the evening.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">They&#39;d fallen into that conversation almost too easily. A simple, light-hearted conversation that anyone could have with anyone else. About metal and swords and Camelot&#39;s best sharpening stone merchants or something, Gwen&#39;s barely functioning brain helpfully supplied. Whatever the exact topic had been, it had been innocent and normal and <i>definitely not this</i>.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">Well, alright, there had been flirting, and it hadn&#39;t taken them very long to go from shy to shameless, but that had been five minutes at the most before they had found themselves laughing into each other&#39;s mouths, slow smiling and lazy and the complete opposite of how they were now. The transition from him leaning against the back wall of the stable building plus her standing an appropriate distance away to both of them on the fresh, unused hay below was even quicker.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">But even then, there&#39;d been a sense of innocence to it all, of fun, and a fluffy sensation in her gut, tingling down below, and a warm, hazy feeling of utter bliss and safety because this was <i>Lancelot. </i>So when <i>that</i> happened, when he did break away from her lips to kiss her neck, right above her hammering pulse point, she opened her mouth and made that humiliating noise but that was it. She didn&#39;t pull away, her hands never left his back, she didn&#39;t shift so the ends of his hair weren&#39;t brushing against her fingers anymore.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">Versus all of that, her verbal slip-up should have meant nothing because she was of age and knew what this was going to become and she was absolutely not nervous in any way. His chest pushing into hers as he&#39;d gone for her throat had forced a sound out, that was all.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">Yet and still, his sweaty, sword-calloused hands went still on her hips and he looked up and oh, she had screwed it all up. He thought she didn&#39;t want this. He was going to roll over and they would lie in the hay staring up at the stars in silence until one of them found the courage to end it and walk away and this would never happen again.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">And for some reason, the very thought was enough to made her eyes sting and her eyebrows furrow and all at once, it became her mission to keep that suddenly horrible scenario from coming true. With all the fervor and determination she imagined a common whore would have, she dug her nails into his back and tried to haul him up to her, going cold when he held fast.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">They looked at each other for a long moment before his face went from neutral to so warm it made her heart hurt, but some childish part of Gwen felt like pouting back when she caught the tiny hint of amusement in his eyes. How dare he know her so well.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">&ldquo;You&#39;re amazing, Gwen,&rdquo; he said, sounding just the right amount of genuine, but it took all but a second for her resulting embarrassment to turn to boldness (like his words were a challenge and she needed to live up to them and just from that look she knew he&#39;d done this before) and she tugged at him again.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">&ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; she demanded, not wanting to give either of them time to think.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">He did, oh lords he did, still smiling and sweet, just slowly leaning in and kissing her forehead and pausing, as if they were both frozen in time while the world spun and crumbled in Gwen&#39;s mind. Her eyes stung worse, her mouth dried out, his hands tightened on her just a little but mostly they just lay there and breathed, suddenly needing to preserve this moment in their minds forever. If his object was to get her to relax, she was almost ashamed to admit to herself how well it worked, feeling the tension leave her body but still stuck in this state of raw happiness that she knew wouldn&#39;t leave for a long, long time.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">Eyes closed, they lost themselves in slow writhing for a good ten minutes after that, not quite the perfect dance of true love that Gwen had literally dreamed about as an imaginative fourteen year old but not like animals, either. When Lancelot moved to nibble at her earlobe and his fingers flitted around the ends of her dress, already hiked up to the knees from their wrestling, she took a deep breath and opened her eyes. The stars glinted above them, and for a fleeting second she remembered that they might be found like this, that people would definitely whisper about them, that someone might be looking for them, but then <i>something</i> pressed hot and firm against her leg and Lancelot sucked his own finger into his mouth, making that trend of thought wink right out of existence.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">They kept most of their clothes in place (even though they&#39;d be soaked through later), just in case they needed to make a quick, breathless getaway holding hands like children in a field, but after fondling gave into rutting and that gave way to<i> two</i> wet, sticky, powerful ends on their thighs and hands Gwen promised herself that one day there would be more. They&#39;d <i>do it</i> even slower than this. She&#39;d show him her breasts and let him lick at her and she&#39;d do the same for him not just on cold nights like this, or when they were lonely or sad, but all the time. She&#39;d repay him for holding still at first breach to let most of the pain and discomfort ebb away as they&#39;d started fifty times over and then more than that.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">Long minutes passed between them and Gwen waited for the high to fade and for the shame to set in. After all, she had just lost her virginity <i>in a stack of hay</i> and surely proper ladies would much prefer velvet pillows and wine to the smell of sweat and earth and constant, awkward readjusting.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">But it never did. For some reason, this was fine. Wonderful, even, she decided while Lancelot gingerly rolled her dress down, brushing straw off her skin along the way.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">&ldquo;Do you feel any different?&rdquo; he asked. She shifted a bit in thought, hissing at the lingering soreness in her lower half and back that Lancelot would massage away later.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">&ldquo;I&#39;d be worried if I felt <i>too</i> different,&rdquo; she admitted. Gwen had never been one to demand what others might see as perfection &ndash; Camelot had its nobles for that. This was like a simple campfire compared to the roaring hearth that the future would bring, but what mattered was the warmth itself and the love she felt and Lancelot&#39;s arms curled tight around her as Camelot slowly fell to sleep around them. They could be hopeless romantics together in a fine bed, or surrounded by hay, or in the middle of the day in a forest, or by a lake, or anywhere as long as Lancelot was still himself and Gwen was still herself.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">And from the accepting look he gave her just then, she knew he agreed. This was another part of their relationship, now. It wasn&#39;t the whole point, of course, even when he made her whimper and she was silently proud herself for every groan she got out of him, but <i>still</i>.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; "">After a bit, they untangled themselves and stood to face the rest of the world, and the first thing the world greeted them with was a gust of wind that blew Gwen&#39;s tangled hair over her face. When it passed and Lancelot moved her curls out of the way just to kiss her on the neck again, she just smiled. &nbsp;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: center; ""><i>Fin</i></p></lj-cut><br /><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; ""></p>"

"event","Bandai&#39;s going down.<br /><br />Y&#39;know, the fact that I&#39;m not super surprised by this depresses me even more than the company closing does. With the way things are going and the general attitude fans in general have towards watching their favorite shows nowadays, there was really no way it would have lasted. No one&#39;s really making a big uproar about this, just like no one really made a big uproar when Tokyopop went down. There is just no more money in importing entertainment into the US, anymore. Or anywhere, really. When the Internet wasn&#39;t around and we sat in front of TVs all day, there was a point to dubbing an anime and bringing it to people who wanted to watch it in other countries. Now, there are three things:<br /><br />1.) Most people prefer subs, and since the &#39;Net took off there&#39;s never been a shortage of people who release fansubs within days of an episode&#39;s TV premiere.&nbsp;<br /><br />2.) I&#39;m going to assume most of the revenue for companies like Bandai and Tokyopop come from DVD and manga sales (just manga for Tokyopop). So, obviously, Mangafox and sites like that ate them just like Amazon ate Borders. And even if sites like Mangafox refuse to put up manga that&#39;s been&nbsp;licensed, a quick Google search will do you well.&nbsp;<br /><br />3.) Anime itself is kind of a dying industry. Manga too, because of the reasons listed above. Not in the sense that it&#39;ll just stop, or one day there will be no more new animes or mangas available outside of Japan, but it&#39;s on it&#39;s way to becoming what Western comic books are today. That sort of niche hobby with a small but dedicated audience, y&#39;know. Even&nbsp;more so&nbsp;than it is today. Same thing with books. A Cracked article from 2010 (Top Everything of the Decade, or something like that) pointed out that there if you exclude Twilight and Harry Potter (which I guess doesn&#39;t count since that began in the &#39;90s), there hasn&#39;t been a book that&#39;s really made an widescale impact on too many people in the past decade. It&#39;s the movies and shows based off the books that make the impact, now.<br /><br />I guess this all could be a good thing, depending on how you look at it. Dedicated enough fans will find a way to enjoy what they love any way they can. I&#39;ll keep watching my old, crappy VHS tapes of Disney movies until I can build up a DVD/Blu-ray collection. And I get that there&#39;s this mentality among people nowadays that something becoming &quot;mainstream&quot; automatically ruins it. Not because it&#39;ll strip a work of its dignity or open it up to be misinterpreted by the masses or get terrible, target demographic-baiting sequels, but... just because. I dunno.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway. I&#39;ve typed enough. Oh, well. At least I can go back to thinking about <lj user=""wd_rewatch"" /> and what I&#39;m going to do with it with a clear head, now.&nbsp;"

This writing&#39;s for entertainment purposes only.<br />Summary:<i> AU in which Suburban Knights never happened. Luke and Film Brain meet at the Critic&#39;s house. It&#39;s about as awkward as you&#39;d expect.</i><br />Warnings: Randomness, plotlessness, un-beta&#39;ed, language, slight shippyness (though I&#39;m not exactly sure how shippy this will get)<br />A/N:<b> Oh Lord, here we go. See what happens when my imagination gets away from me? I swear, I have no idea where I&#39;m going with this story. I&#39;m just kind of... winging it? Sure hope I get the characters wright. I&#39;m still not exactly sure what I&#39;m gonna do with the whole Luke/Film Brain thing. Let&#39;s just hope it turns out with as little plot/characterization holes as possible. xD</b><br /><lj-cut text=""Why yes, these chapters are short and wordy. Why do you ask?""><br /><br />Ten minutes after the Nostalgia Critic graciously allowed him inside (boy, Chicago winds could get pretty bloody cold in autumn) and five minutes after he&#39;d stopped apologizing for not getting the right latte (it was four creams and three sugars and oh God he was so <i>stupid</i>), Film Brain had a few new facts straight. Okay, maybe just a couple, but non-Critic related facts weren&#39;t really all that important, were they?<br /><br />So, turned out Not-Critic&#39;s name was Logan Mochrie or Leonardo Mochrie or something to that effect. Not-Critic was also a &ldquo;rising star&rdquo; on ThatGuyWithTheGlasses.com who exploited his tragic split personality issues to gain fans. Admittedly, psychology wasn&#39;t his strong point, but it still took Film Brain little more than an instant to declare that the saddest thing he&#39;d heard in life.<br /><br />Jesus, the man even gave the personalities names, for God&#39;s sakes. It was probably gonna break all their crazy little hearts when that &ldquo;rising star&rdquo; status crashed into a sun somewhere. After all, the public wanted quality, not cheap gimmicks!<br /><br />As for why he was here in the first place...<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, I live down the street,&rdquo; Lex (or Luther?) said flippantly, and Film Brain couldn&#39;t help but be deeply offended because that asshole had compared him to a stalker not long ago. He was the stalkerish one, dammit, living down the street from the Critic like that. Probably had a high-tech telescope so he could look straight through the windows of the houses in between them, directly into Critic&#39;s living room. Just the thought was enough to make Film Brain a little sick.<br /><br />And it must have showed, since Lardface (oh yeah, that was definitely his name) was looking at him strangely from his place on the couch again. Only a little teensy bit embarrassed, Film Brain cleared his throat. He&#39;d save his complete and scathing deconstruction of this newcomer, this intruder for later. Hopefully he&#39;d catch the other guy alone in some dark corner and give him what for sometime soon. Revenge was never easy on the eyes, but the way Critic gazed into this wannabe reviewer&#39;s eyes when he introduced him was more than enough to entice vengeful rage from the true right-hand man.<br /><br />The Nostalgia Critic, thankfully, was too busy to notice the looks what&#39;s-his-face and Film Brain were shooting each other, pacing the room with his hands behind his back in a very leader-like manner.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&#39;m glad you two came,&rdquo; he nodded in their direction, &ldquo;but I wasn&#39;t expecting the response to be this pathetic. I could&#39;ve used Sage. Or Snob; he&#39;s a dickhole but he&#39;s smart. Since I don&#39;t have them, it looks like I&#39;ll just have to work with you two. Can either of you wield heavy weaponry and-or set up booby traps?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Wait a second, you haven&#39;t even told us what the bet was!&rdquo; said split-personality lad, making Film Brain nearly squeal with glee. Now was his first chance to defend the Critic and reinforce his standing as the favorite!<br /><br />&ldquo;Well obviously he must have a good reason not to say it, don&#39;t you Mr. Critic?&rdquo; he asked and immediately regretted it because oh, his tone of voice came out all wrong and it sounded like he was agreeing with Lardface, made all the worse when Critic <i>glared</i> at him for it. He totally should have smiled or something to let them know of his support! One step forward, a million steps back!<br /><br />&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; NC replied shortly before Film Brain could stutter out an apology. &ldquo;Let&#39;s just say it involved a tapeworm. Actually, three. It also involved two hundred dollars. Plus, there was some yarn, and I&#39;m not gonna say anymore. Happy?&rdquo;<br /><br />Film Brain and the unimportant one nodded.<br /><br />&ldquo;Anyway, I&#39;m going to have to re-think my plan a little since only two of you showed up. Luke, you&#39;re with me. I hope you have a few hours to spare.&rdquo;<br /><br />Just like that, those few words completely shattered what little hope there was for any alone time with the Critic, at least not anytime soon. Did seniority count for anything, anymore?<br /><br />And Luke (so <i>that</i> was his name), that mediocre excuse of an underling, just shrugged. <i>Shrugged</i>, like somehow this was unimportant and not vital to the survival of their website. Like he was doing this because he was <i>bored</i>.<br /><br />&ldquo;Eh, it&#39;s the weekend, so... yeah, I guess.&rdquo; Oh, that guy was going down. Surely, Critic would realize how much better Film Brain was when he tackled his own task with enthusiasm and dedication that this Luke person didn&#39;t have. This new revelation enthralled Film Brain so much that he almost didn&#39;t catch Critic turning to address him.<br /><br />&ldquo;And you... um, fellow reviewer.&rdquo; Though he didn&#39;t correct him, Film Brain nearly panicked. Did the NC really not remember his name? Maybe he would have to take out Luke sooner than he thought. &ldquo;You&#39;re in charge of defense.&rdquo;<br /><br />Defense. Film Brain could bloody <i>do</i> defense. He&#39;d do defense so hard it wouldn&#39;t be able to walk for a week. He&#39;d do it so awesomely his leader would have to remember his name and his accomplishments and his worthiness of being second in command. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t even need to sabotage Luke if he did defense well enough!<br /><br />And that&#39;s how Film Brain was assigned to build what he would surely later declare to be the Best Wall of Blocking in the History of Man.</lj-cut>"

Sorry for any mental scars I cause. xD</b><br /><lj-cut text=""To the fic! :D""><br /><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Most would say it was just a coincidence that Film Brain&#39;s cell phone started ringing and &ldquo;<i>NEW TEXT MSG: NOSTALGIA CRITIC&lt;333</i>&rdquo; popped up on screen while he was actually editing the part of his next video in which he complimented said critic for his latest mention in a widely-read filmmaker&#39;s magazine. Good timing and nothing more, a sane person would have thought, instead of things like <i>fate</i>, <i>destiny</i>, <i>finally</i>, <i>this is meant to be</i>, <i>finally</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">,</span><i> he actually needs me</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">,</span><i> finallyfinallyfinally</i> all coming to mind at once in a tidal wave of unbridled joy.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Then again, sanity was the last thing an Internet reviewer of Film Brain&#39;s experience and rank was expected to have at this point. Having to sit through hours upon hours of only a smidgen of good movies and a shitload of bad ones could wear a man down after a while, never mind the stuff that was just plain <i>boring</i>.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Like this review he was working on. The film in question was just so uninteresting the audience would forgive him for taking a few moments to give homage to a wonderful entertainer like the Nostalgia Critic. He&#39;d even found a way to sneak the reference into that wild rant he&#39;d gone off into in the middle of the review! The Critic loved humor, tearing apart bad movies, and praise. All three in the span of five minutes would no doubt make for a winner.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">He could almost see it as he reached for his phone, could almost smell the delicious cup of coffee he would hand his all-knowing leader while he received a gracious nod of acknowledgment for his good deeds. Whatever the Critic needed, he would do it, and the reward of becoming his idol&#39;s favorite would be his!</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>NEW TEXT MSG: NOSTALGIA CRITIC&lt;333</i></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>HELP. LOST BET AGAINST PHALLUS AND SPOONY AND JOE. NEED PROTECTION. BE READY TO STAY FOR NIGHT. NO COMPENSATION EXCEPT FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE MAYBE!!</i></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">And gratitude was all Film Brain needed.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">&ndash;</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">In no time, he had everything. Car (what if they needed to make a getaway)? Check. ID (although it probably wouldn&#39;t help in case he needed to pose as the Nostalgia Critic if the police got involved...)? Check. Sleeping bag, pillow, and extra blanket (in case he had to sleep in the backyard again to conserve space)? Check.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">Latte with three creams and four sugars, just the way the Critic liked it? Hell yes. They didn&#39;t call him Film <i>Brain</i> for nothing. Y&#39;know, &#39;cause the &ldquo;Brain&rdquo; part meant he was smart and he deserved respect for it, yes he did. Mr. Critic wouldn&#39;t be overlooking him this time, especially since he figured that he was going to be the only one there.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;"">After all, everyone else was busy dealing their own lives, sadly lacking the privilege to drop everything and rush to the aid of their superior. But not Film Brain, because Film Brain was special and thoughtful and all that other good stuff worthy of notice from the almighty ruler of their ragtag crew. And every leader needed a right hand man, right?</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">The drive to the Critic&#39;s house was long, more than an hour and a half, but time flew by as the sheer excitement Film Brain felt kept its grip on him good and tight. Suffocating, even, like he was the criminal and Critic was the hangman and the anticipation was a noose of joy ready to just choke him into heaven. It was powerful enough to carry him through the entire trip, right up to the moment his fist tapped lightly on the Critic&#39;s door. </font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">&ldquo;Critic? Are you in there?&rdquo; he called out. No answer. After waiting a moment, he knocked again. </font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">&ldquo;Criiiiiiitic? It&#39;s me! Film Brain! I have coffee and I can help, since you sent a text saying you needed that and all. I was in the area and &ndash;&rdquo;</font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">He stopped short as the door opened, and suddenly the noose of joy became a chain of pain dragging him down to hell because </span></span><i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">whoever</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> it was standing before him now was definitely not Critic, which drove a splintery stake across all of the Critic/Film Brain bonding that was supposed to take place that day. Well, at least the major details of this person, absorbed in insanely fast once-over by the Brain&#39;s widened eyes, pointed to him not being the Nostalgia Critic in any way, shape, or form. Or anyone he recognized, really. </span></span></font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">Mind reeling, he spared a quick glance over the other man&#39;s shoulder, scanning the slightly messy living room which he knew far too well. The real NC was nowhere to be seen.</font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo; was out of his mouth before his more rational side could think of a better, more civil greeting. In any other situation, Film Brain might have mentally reprimanded himself for what was an egregious lapse in his much-treasured British politeness, but self-forgiveness came pretty easily wherever Mr. Critic was involved. </font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">Someone had once described Film Brain as looking crazy whenever he displayed too much emotion, like an puppy offered a treat or a serial killer. In his defense, he was <i>trying </i>not to show how... put out he was by this new development, but it must have not been working because not-Nostalgia Critic was openly staring right at him, eyebrow raised, his hand gripping the door like he wanted to slam it and run. </font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">&ldquo;Um, hi,&rdquo; Film Brain tried again, managing something that might have been <i>akin</i> to a smile. Politeness hadn&#39;t failed him yet! &ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo;</font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">At that, not-NC seemed to go from weirded out (and possibly a little scared) to unimpressed, giving Film Brain yet another reason to add to his already long, long list of reasons to be distrustful of this person. Honestly, how <i>rude</i>. </font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">&ldquo;Why should I tell you?&rdquo; the curly-haired man responded, crossing his arms. &ldquo;You could be one of those stalkers Critic&#39;s always telling me about &ndash;&rdquo;</font></span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; widows: 2; orphans: 2;""><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><font color=""#010101"">Oh, fuck this guy.

For those who haven&#39;t watched every single episode yet, <a href=""http://www.awkwardblackgirl.com/episodes"">The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl</a> is completely and totally worth your time. This is a show for everyone who&#39;s ever felt awkward in the history of forever, not just awkward black girls. Do not let the title fool you.<br /><br />I&#39;m starting this community <lj user=""awkwardblackgrl"" /> because this show freaking deserves one. Mostly I&#39;ll try to keep it alive by dumping icons there and maybe cranking out a couple of drabbles when I stop feeling so self-conscious about my writing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, and I&#39;ll only be pimping the com once I get the layout and banner set up.<br /><br />Peace."

I mean... ugh. Jesus, I hope this is the last time. Please let it be the last time.

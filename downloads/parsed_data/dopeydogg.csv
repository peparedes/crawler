the wait is over simply because it is no longer mine.

he proposed, she accepted, and i still can&#39;t tell anyone how i feel, so here it is - i&#39;m laying it out here.
4 april 2012, the last day i spoke to her.
she said it would be best i stopped contacting her, and so i did, and it&#39;s been 2 years 8 months 9 days.
i have only just recently blocked her on facebook, not because i didn&#39;t want her to look me up, but because i was so sick to the stomach with myself, for letting myself stalk her, for killing myself ever so slowly. it really was killing me.
every moment that has passed in that 2.5 years has just felt like me passing the time, waiting for the right time, when she would be mine again.
when would she be mine again?

where does this lead me now? which path do i go down? i feel so lost. it is hard not to shed a tear when i think about it.
there are some things in life you make peace with, and then there are the things you just never.
all you can do is avoid it for as long as you can.

it is so silly to suffer alone, for no reason, but here i am doing just that."

"event","well, today&#39;s entry is more like a blog entry more than anything else since i guess this really is turning into my blog!

some days i wake up and i just feel like ending it. ending me. ending pain. is taking your own life really weakness? or is that the opinion society has formed? they says it takes great courage to live, but who the fuck are we kidding? how many of us have thought about it and are still alive today?

i&#39;ve done some really stupid things in my life, i really have. plentiful. i have never really been sure of what i&#39;ve wanted out of life.
if there&#39;s any one thing i was a thousand percent sure of, it was her. but i managed to screw that up. i&#39;m not doing nothing about it. i&#39;m working on it. really really really hard to mend things. not sure if i&#39;m strong-willed for fighting, or just a really big idiot who is totally disconnected from the reality.

hence the opening paragraph. some days i don&#39;t know what the hell i&#39;m doing anymore. i want an answer, like, right now, right this moment. i want to call her, i want to know now. 4 years together, this was something i felt was worth fighting for.
Patience they say. but patience is merely a word used to describe a trait, and doesn&#39;t always count for anything depending on the situation.

there&#39;s a whole lot more on my mind but i don&#39;t want to spew rubbish, and i don&#39;t want to sound incoherent by mixing in a whole bunch of unstructured nonsense. i&#39;m a thinker, and this is probably one of the rare times i&#39;m going with my feelings.
i want to believe in hope, i want to have faith, i want to believe that there is something somewhere out there actually has the answer to everything, that a clear sign will be given."

"event","so god, tell me- am i undeserving, am i a bad person, i can&#39;t tell anymore, i feel so numb, some days, it just feels a lot easier if there was a simpler way to make the pain go away. i&#39;m not the kind to show my feelings. but just this time, just this once, i wish someone could feel exactly what i&#39;m feeling. the pain is unbearable, everything intolerable. the pressure is immense. i thought i was working towards a goal- a brighter future with her. to right all wrong. but today, everything changed. my world is collapsing over and over. i try to take the pain away but the moment i stop drinking, the pain just kicks in and boy, it&#39;s one hell of a kick. i can&#39;t control myself anymore. i feel like anything i do now is pointless. so god, tell me. take this pain away from me, because without someone to share this pain, my life is meaningless."

"event","i finally understand what you meant when you told me that you felt you were losing me, and there was nothing you could do.
what are my plans? i'm currently in limbo - should i stay or should i go.
i am waiting on a response but lately i've been feeling the exact same feeling you had 2 years ago.
you are slowly getting out of reach and i dont know what to do.
sometimes you have to lose something of importance to know its importance in the first place...

no matter the outcome, i hope that my life can finally begin.

i used to think i knew it all, but really, really, i know nothing.
life is full of choices. none is good none is bad, but a single decision can turn out to be the best or the worst
i see that i was wrong, thinking i would win. oh how wrong was i.

trying to get my groove on and get into study mode, but this problem is constantly tugging on my heartstrings.
i've been trying to work hard, trying to be the man, THAT man.

i said before that i hope you find happiness, but deep down i really really want to be a part of that happiness.
the mistakes i've made are a lesson that has helped me attained a clearer picture of what i want, what things are, and hopefully what amazing things are to come of it.
the only question now is whether we are still on the same page.

i hope that i can break free of these chains that bind me.

i'm really happy i made this blog years ago, at first i thought it quite lame, but its purpose is slowly growing and i find some sort of comfort in blogging here."

"event","hey it's been well over a year since my last entry. lots has happened since then. the lessons learned, the Who that i am now, and the What that i am in now. interesting eh?

am doing my national service now. well, it definitely IS an experience like no other.

when i was in poly, i thought, hey, i've seen them all, the liars, the hypocrites, the slackers, the alpha and the omega. BUT, lo and behold, welcome to NS, where you can see even more cocks. its like singapore zoo and african safari, you only see so much in your own space, but when you are in the safari, you see more exotic animals. just like ns, you see all types. they most probably come from your neighbourhood, your school, your church, but in the end u only see what they are really like when u are forced to get close to them.

like most other people of my kind, by kind meaning vocation, i'm pretty much happy with where i am, less the cocks, cocks come in different shapes, sizes and ranks by the way.

some lessons learned though (through ns), is that there are cocks everywhere, and one of the most pesky sort of cocks, are the petty, and the bitchy. its ns man, to be petty in ns, is like to be a soldier in your own army. and to bitch about your own mates all the time, you could also well be your own soldier, friend, buddy, for the next two years. and another lesson learned is that, one should be himself, and no one should have to tell him how to act or behave. you can't please everyone. people will always despise one another, be jealous of one another, and they will always want to tell you how to behave, how to change, to make Themselves feel better. just be YOU. be confident, don't let nobody drag you down. that is wat will separate you from the bottom. that is wat will make you strong. i get my fair share of criticism as well, and i never let them bring me down, and i never hold a grudge against them. i'm going to the top.

well, can't say i get along Fantastically well with my mates, but i'm just okay with them. no strong bond there sorry. 

so there, thats my life in ns. i know its not full of fun or anything like that, but thats alright, i just want to serve and FO haha"

"event","Happy 2006!

wow it's been a long time since i've come on and bitch about life.

lots have happened since the last entry, i don't know where to begin, honestly.
currently, i'm probably one of the most bitched about guys in lecture,
having done all the things no one usually does. wrong things mainly. well, not wrong either.

that girl i've been after is finally with me now after what seemed like eternity.
i had a fling with someone before that. no regrets.
my grades are still like shit.
and yes, my lecture group must be bitching about me when they are sleeping.

so let me explain how i ended up with her, besides using my good looks and charm. (hehe)

while waiting around for my girl to break with her ex (that she has no feelings for)
in the meantime i hooked up with this girl who was really cute.
sure sure, you say, how could i do such a thing.
well, at that time, i was getting tired of waiting around.
i mean this isn't the land of pokemons, don't expect someone to wait forever, if makes me look like a fool.
plus i had a lot of friends who discouraged me from waiting forever, and asked me to go for (the fling) it.

i'm being brief here as you can see. i'm lazy today.

so anyway, she broke and we got together. yippy!

and why is my lecture group bitching about me?
simple, it's tied back to the same situation as the girl.
they hear about the story of how i got with her and bam! down goes my reputation.

in case you are lost, let me briefly explain what happened between me and her.
i'll be brief. i'll try.

the girl, C, has a bf, F.
my classmate K, likes C.
everyone more or less knows C doesn't have feelings for F.
however K didn't get C, he was upset of course.
and he knew it was over between them.
i, being a good friend of K then, still went for C.

i know it makes me look bad. it does! i understand.
anyway i'm lazy so i'm just gonna cut my story short.

so anyway, C's friends actually discouraged this relationship, because they felt i didn't give in enough, and i was an ass for betraying K, among other things.

i don't understand what the fuck they mean by i don't give in enough.
i'm sorry for not being a wussbag that just loves to compliment my girl every day of the year.
i'm sorry for not being a wussbag that doesn't dare speak his mind.
i'm sorry for not being a wussbag that does everything she asks of.
i'm sorry for not being a wussbag that is terribly unreasonable and unfair to himself.
yeah i'm so sorry i'm not a wussbag.

in fact, her friends are soooo ""expert"" in the arts of courtship and relationship, maybe all girls can take their advice, and find a nerd or a robot. that'll work. but the robot is better, he won't breakdown - as fast.

oh please.

and about me being a bastard for betraying K?
i don't think they were wrong, but i don't think they were correct either.
i mean it was already over between them. so it's really how you look at it.
c'mon, i didn't even bitch that much when my good friend, and I were going after the same girl (different girl).
it's ok with me, it's not ok with them. fair enough, but then i'm not trying to please everyone. so very very sorry about that.
of course, i hadn't had the chance to share my side of the story with anyone, partly because i don't think i really NEED to explain myself for my actions, and it's really none of their business.

the part that really pisses me off, is why doesn't anybody see my effort in trying to get this girl.
everyone's so caught up thinking about what a bad person i am, what a downright backstabbing motherfucking betrayer i am.
don't tell me no one stopped to think if i really liked her at all?
i didn't go through all this shit just to give myself a sense of satisfaction.
i didn't hang in there so long just to see how long it takes before i go crazy.
they compare me with K and F, and say i'm not as nice as them.
fuck yeah they were right, i'm not as nice, i'm not even them, and i'm not a wussbag either. sorry again!
i'm not all about being nice and making sure my girl grows into a huge brat.
it's all about give and take, not give or take."

some days i just want to pour my heart out
but i don't know why i keep resisting
maybe i know somehow if i let out too much everything will be harder
harder if she found out i was serious
i'm so bad at this jioing thing i think i can get an award

this is one person whom i think fits me so well so perfect it seems unreal even for me
its true, i've been brave, but i don't know how long i can take it

oh god, there are so many good reasons not to go for this girl:
-
she's attached
my friend is crazy over her and i go behind his back and put a knife in it
his good friend is also my friend
and she's quite a flirt
she's no supermodel hot stuff
i would be throwing all my integrity away

i've even been told by close friends to watch out, to turn the other way, to play along.
play along i tried. hell no, i couldn't even last a day.
in the words of a friend, i'm apparently too ""righteous"".
play along i asked. hell no, i couldn't even make myself play along
the feeling is just too real

but the reasons to go for it are even more overpowering:
-
i've been told by close friends that if this is something i really want, i should go for it. no, i Must go for it.
i've fallen in love with her loud voice, big hips (hehe), her very weird mouth and uneven teeth, her chin-neck thing, her not so tone arms, her tiny hands, her curvy waist, her knees, her calves. to me, it makes her perfect.
she's confident
and i feel, there's something in her that needs that little bit of love

in one of my previous entries quite a while back i said i was looking for someone independent, who loved their freedom but at the same time wanted to have their guy to come home to, someone you feel comfortable showing to anyone, someone you could give a nice loving hug and a peck on the lips to anywhere, someone who would be your best friend and soulmate, someone you can sit with and just feel happy, comfortable, relaxed, contented.
and during a phone conversation with her, she told me what she herself was looking for in a guy, and it was so close to what i was looking for myself i almost freaked out and fell off my bed.
do you know how fucking rare is it to find someone who actually fits this criteria so closely, i swear i was trying to control my emotions when i heard her say those things.
i was thinking ""shit! what the hell is she doing with someone else? hell! what the hell am i doing not being with her?!""
of course, i've never been good at self expression and i hardly ever do the right things at the right time

she ain't no supermodel, but hey, to me, she's <b>perfect</b>, and i hope, she would not just be a mere memory, cause i want it to last forever."

"event","Love and marriage has slowly lost its meaning in the society that we live in today

No longer do we look for fun, and excitment, in our so called ""significant"" other

We yearn for stability, a sort of undying loyalty in the partner.

Yet, and Yet, we know, it is not the best fit.

Maybe we get caught up with the rest of what's happening in life, the hustle and bustle,

that we only want the safest route out.

The risk-free.

Then we grow up, marry the stable partner who has been so loyal,

Even though he/she knows you only have half-a-heart for them,

Even though they know they will never have you.

Even though you cheat on them.

You grow even older. ""Marriage syndrome"" kicks in.

You start arguing with the partner, You cheat on your partner, with someone who can ""fulfill"" your unmet fantasies.

and Marriage? It gets boring.

Or the second scenario:

You are so disciplined, you don't even cheat, think twice, or doubt your partner

You have arguments but they are always settled

You start to love your partner even more as you grow older

The second scenario, is a possibility, but I'm not much of a dreamer, I believe in the realness of situations. I think the amount of effort (waiting and all that)  is not worth it. The cheating partner has way more power, it is not a love relationship. It is a servant-master relationship.

What do I mean by power in this situation? The cheating partner can afford to cheat as much as they want. The loyal partner is just a blind person. The cheating partner is insecure and needs to hang on to the blind person as someone to fall back on if all else fails, or they don't feel confident in getting the right person.

Why do I say its a dream? The second scenario is what we always see in movies. It is the ideal scene, but not the most realistic. How much do you expect from the loyal partner? They won't change overnight.

I think sometimes the loyal partners cheat themselves, and the cheating partners cheat themselves as well. Loyal partner thinks they can make cheating partner change hearts, and cheating partner thinks they cannot do better.

I just can't see myself in that situation. that is not me. will never be.

It has become, a dead society.

Take a good second look."

lyrics =D

<em>There's no combination of words 
I could put on the back of a postcard 
No song I could sing 
But I can try for your heart 
Our dreams, and they are made out of real things 
Like a, shoebox of photographs 
With sepia-tone loving 
Love is the answer, 
At least for most of the questions in my heart 
Like why are we here? and where do we go? 
And how come we're so hard? 
It's not always easy and 
Sometimes life can be deceiving 
I'll tell you one thing its always better when we're together 

Mmmm, it's always better when we're together 
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together 
Well, it's always better when we're together 
Yeah, it's always better when we're together 

And all of these moments 
Just might find there way into my dreams tonight 
But I know that they'll be gone 
When the morning light sings 
And brings new things 
But tomorrow night you see 
That they'll be gone too 
Too many things I have to do 
But if all of these dreams might find there way 
Into my day to day scene 
I'll be under the impression 
I was somewhere in between 
With only two 
Just me and you 
Not so many things we got to do 
Or places we got to be 
We'll sit beneath the mango tree 

Yeah, it's always better when we're together 
Mmmm, somewhere in between together 
Well, it's always better when we're together 
Yeah, it's always better when we're together 

(Mmmm, etc.) 

I believe in memories 
They look so, so pretty when I sleep 
Hey now, and when I wake up, 
You look so pretty sleeping next to me 
But there is not enough time, 
And there is no song I could sing 
And there is no, combination of words I could say 
But I will still tell you one thing 
We're Better together.</em>"

OH but the reasons are good. good. not obvious but good.

if you keep doing something for someone

of course nothing works out right.

Anyone can say they're above this all.
It takes my pain away.

I can't let it bother me.

"event","when whoever comes along and does something to you, to make you feel hurt, or does something behind your back or whatever reason, you damn well remember to stand up for your God damn self.

even if you're OKAY with it, u make sure you don't let it slide EASY.

cos then, you're just being a big puss or you're too lazy to get off your fat ass and do something about it.

if you just let it slide, everything will seem fine for <em>a while</em> and then when they do it again, and again, and they test your patience etc. ah..den you know.

just play along, be pissed, get them to apologise, do stuff for you etc lol
always turn the situation around whenever possible.

besides, everyone has a right to stand up for him/herself."

"event","i know i said before i don't want to be the person i think i'm becoming.
i'm just saying it again, cos everytime i say it,
i want to be different, i want to change, i really do want it more than ever.

i'm putting a fucking lot of effort this semester,
or maybe this semester has been so hectic it keeps me busy.
meetings, interviews, driving, her, friends,
oh God i dun even have time for tutorials
i want my life to be balanced, not just filled with A grades.

motivation is running at all time high, and i hope i'm doing this for myself.
cos right now i think i'm trying to be the best for someone else,
which is not a bad reason. but if things don't turn out well,
i'm afraid of losing this motivation to make my life better.

get it?

in other news, my group has been granted the chance to hold the biggest project among all entrepreneur students haha
i'll just keep you in suspense, i want this to work man
just a few hints
it involves a lot of money, sponsors, a heck lot of people, man hours, and great beats

if the girl who rejected you is on your msn list,
for God sake don't put a nick like - Our story, i won't forget, i will ....

something like that.
talking like there was anything to begin with.

<em>this world is in serious shit.

and the guys are becoming ladies.</em>

that's what i keep this journal for right haha.

alright, on to more important stuff (myself, of course)
err there is progress i think.
dammit i can't even be sure,
if the person was like half reluctant kinda, and in the end agrees (could be due to slight pushing) to watch a movie with you, Plus, she has watched the movie, then wat kinda signal is she sending? oh yeah and all that late night talking too.

"event","tell me how i can help my best friend.

tell me how i can help my younger brother.

tell me how i can help myself.


i think the best way to motivate a person is to make him/her want it BAD enough.
but how do you do that? how do you fricking do that?

as for my own self. ah yes, let me say why i don't like to tell people who i like.

you see, when u tell her friends that you like her and they tell her.
what you just did was you gave your power away.
you let her control the situation because She knows she has that power to do so.

dammit. i neeeed control.
er anyway, i only told two people, but somehow everyone knows now.
argh complicated. but that's not a big problem, just thought i'll write this down.

hopefully i come up with more ideas. this is so a-r-g-h."

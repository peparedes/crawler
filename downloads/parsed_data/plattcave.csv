"event","So this weekend was the 2nd annual Maine Comics Arts Festival, my first comics show behind the table as a cartoonist.

And it rocked.

I&nbsp;drove down to Portland on Saturday and spent the day wandering around that fine city. MECAF panels were going on all day, but I&nbsp;just poked my head in briefly and looked at the art show. I&nbsp;really wanted to be outdoors, stretching my legs, eating city food, and moving. And so I&nbsp;did. I&nbsp;had some truly amazing gourmet pizza (I&nbsp;forget the name of the place, but the pizza had butternut squash on it); I&nbsp;went into every bookstore in town, including the Green Hand bookstore, which also hosts the International Cryptozoology Museum (to which I&nbsp;just had to return); I&nbsp;shopped at MECAF&nbsp;sponsor Casablanca Comics (they kindly gave their exhibitors a 25%-off coupon, which I&nbsp;proudly spent); and I&nbsp;hit a few other cool places.

Saturday night was the artists' reception at the Inn on Peaks Island. A 20-minute ferry ride across the waters brought us there in style, and the event sponsors plied us all with free booze and food. I&nbsp;met a bunch of cool folks that night, which was great, since I didn't know anyone there going in.

Later that night, back in my hotel room, I&nbsp;crashed hard upon hearing of the murder of comics and animation writer Steve Perry. But that will need to be discussed another time.

Sunday I&nbsp;was up with the sun... or what little of it we had. The fog never lifted the entire day!&nbsp;I've never seen a day like that. I&nbsp;got some cool photos, which I'll share with you soon.

I&nbsp;think I was one of the first artists to arrive and set up Sunday morning. The Casablanca Comics crew (especially co-owner Rick Lowell) was on top of everything and never seemed to stop moving. I&nbsp;met a few more cool folks who were set up around me, and then the doors opened at 10am sharp.

People never stopped streaming into the show the entire day, which was pretty cool. Lots and lots of families, since it was advertised as free admission for kids.

The show was split into two rooms:&nbsp;one major room with all of the slightly bigger-named artists and a smaller room near the entrance where folks like me where stationed. This made sure there was a lot of traffic through our room at all times, but it also kept people from spending too much money because they wanted to see what lay beyond the first room.

Sales were steady, and I'm happy with the amount of mini-comics I&nbsp;sold and the number of free sketches I&nbsp;gave away. One mini-comic -- My Beard in Alternate Dimensions -- almost sold out, which was awesome.

I saw a bunch of people that I&nbsp;knew, but had no real time to stop and chat with them. I&nbsp;only wandered the main floor one time, and missed half of the folks I&nbsp;wanted to see. Plus I&nbsp;in the middle of the mid-afternoon energy ebb when I was walking around, so the conversations I&nbsp;could have were pretty brief and lackluster. Sigh. Oh well, That's the price you pay when you're behind the table instead of walking around as a customer, I&nbsp;guess.

I'll probably report on a few of the cool items I&nbsp;picked up or which people generously gave me. But right now, I'm behind on a dozen deadlines, so it's back to the old keyboard.

Thanks to the MECAF organizers, staff, volunteers, artists and attendees for a great time!"

"event","In my rare moments of spare time, I&nbsp;am re-reading Stan Sakai's great comic book series Usagi Yojimbo from the beginning. 

Actually, that's not 100% accurate. I'm reading some of the stories for the first time. It took me years to track down every issue of the series, and I&nbsp;skipped reading many issues as I&nbsp;bought them because they weren't in order. Now that I&nbsp;have them all (something I&nbsp;actually accomplished more than a year ago -- hey, I've been busy), I&nbsp;can finally read them all.

What's funny, though, is that I've decided to leave my comics in place and order the collected book versions from the library (inter-library loan is the greatest thing ever). I'm through the first five books now, and the next five will be delivered to my local library this week.

Until they arrive, I am actually going off plan and taking a quick look at the individual comics reprinted in the books I&nbsp;just read. The books don't contain story notes, or the backups (frequently by Sakai), so there are plenty of reasons to read both versions. I&nbsp;won't keep this up, though -- the other issues are buried too far back in my closet.

How long will it take me to read 25-plus years of comics?&nbsp;We'll see. But I'm sure it will be an enjoyable ride."

"event","Whoo boy. Last week kicked my brain in the stomach. And the pain was all caused by computer problems.

I've known that my old PC was dying for a couple of months ago, so several weeks ago I&nbsp;ordered a new one:&nbsp;a top-of-the-line, maxed out Dell with a giant monitor. I&nbsp;knew it would make all of my work much easier. The huge screen would help my eyes and my posture, while the speedy computer would make research faster and enable me to do more things online.

Of course, before I could do any of that, the new computer had to actually arrive!

It hasn't been reported in the news much, but there's a shortage of chips that manufacturers are using to make computers and other devices. This is really slowing down production, and making it hard for companies to assemble as many computers as they need to deliver.

So my order was delayed, and meanwhile, my old computer decided it just didn't want to keep on living.

Oh, we kept it going for a few days, but it was pretty hairy there for a while. Luckily, we pumped it full of placebos and made it think it was healthier than it was, and it lasted long enough for the new computer to arrive and for me to transfer over all of my files.

That last part wasn't easy. I've had a backup hard drive for years (a 250GB&nbsp;Iomega). It's a great little piece of hardware, but here's the problem:&nbsp;the software that backs stuff up onto the drive compresses and encrypts it. That data can only be decompressed and unencrypted by the original PC!&nbsp;So if you're trying to recover your data onto a new computer, you're shit outta luck.

Windows 7 comes with what I've heard is a good program to transfer your files to your new computer, but I tried it and it didn't work for me. Neither did a program I&nbsp;bought called PC&nbsp;Mover. Augh!

Luckily, in a moment of genius, I&nbsp;realized that the Iomega might suck as a backup drive, but I&nbsp;could just use it as a removable hard drive. Rather than let Iomega's crappy program copy my files, I&nbsp;just selected them all and dragged them to the hard drive, copying them with no encryption or compression. Then I&nbsp;just copied them over to my new PC. Peace at last ruled the land.

Now that I have my new computer set up (and it is a beauty), I&nbsp;have signed up for Carbonite, an online backup system that costs $55 a year and automatically copies my files any time I&nbsp;change or add to them. It's still in the process of the initial backup -- which will take a few days, since American broadband is so slow -- but after that, all of my stories, articles, photos, cartoons, music, etc. will be safe.

Having a good backup plan is essential for writers. Iomega should have been a good solution, but it sucked big time and I'll never buy any of their products again. Dell did right by me in the long run, and I'm happy with my new computer. 

Now all I&nbsp;need to do is get enough new writing assignments to pay for it!"

"event","Man oh man, have I&nbsp;been busy the last week. In addition to the usual slate of articles and marketing projects, I have also been trying to concentrate on the creative work a bit more. I&nbsp;submitted 12 poems and 1 short story, received a rejection on another short story, and started work on my next mini-comics. (I&nbsp;have enough material written for two mini-comics, but finding time to draw them is another story.)<br /><br />I've also been dealing with deadly computer problems, as my old PC is just about ready to give up the ghost. Heck, it may have died yesterday. I'm waiting to hear back out from our trusty local IT&nbsp;guy before I&nbsp;take it into the woods and shoot it. (I'm working on my little netbook now, which is a decent little computer, if a bit slow. I have the big monitor and keyboard hooked up to it, so I&nbsp;can work without hunching over it like Quasimodo.)<br /><br />I&nbsp;have a new Dell on order, and it should have been here by now, but it was delayed until next week. I've read that all of the computer manufacturers are dealing with chip shortages caused by the financial slowdown, so let this be a triple lesson for you:&nbsp;1)&nbsp;If you're going to need a new computer, order it early. 2)&nbsp;Always have multiple backup systems in place. And 3)&nbsp;Always have a spare computer lying around for emergencies.<br /><br />Anyway, here's a list of most of my articles from the last week.

"event","I never think of &quot;Platt&quot; as a common last name, but truth be told, it's hardly uncommon.

And you know what seems to be the most common first name for Platts? John.

There's John Platt, the famous physicist.

Another famous John Platt works for Microsoft.

The screenwriter of &quot;Lambada: The Forbidden Dance&quot; was named John Platt. (He's now a producer on &quot;Big Brother.&quot;)

WFUV radio has a DJ named John Platt.

&quot;Big Jon&quot; Platt has done music for several movies, including two in the &quot;Saw&quot; series.

Another John Platt runs deer and turkey hunts in Kansas. 

In Alaska, John Platt is a third-generation fisherman whose livelihood is still being impacted by the Exxon Valdez spill.

There are more. Trust me, there are more. (How many more? Here's an indication: a few years ago, a friend of mine found seven &quot;John Platt&quot; gravestones in his local cemetery. And it was a tiny cemetery!)

Spurred by the Lambada Platt, I started using my middle initial in my byline in the early 1990s. &quot;John R. Platt&quot; wrote hundreds of stories, poems, articles, essays and reviews. A few people over the years have accused me of ripping off the &quot;R&quot; from author Joe R. Lansdale, who without question is one of my favorite writers, but I didn't discover his work until a few years after I started using the R myself.

Lately, though, the R has been drifting out of my byline. I'm not really sure why. I don't introduce myself to people in person using my middle initial, so I guess it seems a bit more natural to go without it in print as well.

I have pretty much decided that my fiction and poetry will still be JRP productions. My marketing work definitely has no R. Journalism seems about half-and-half these days. 

What happens next? Damned it I know. But I can pretty much guarantee that other John Platts may be asking the same question along the way.


So, how about you? Have your bylines or pseudonyms created any confusion in your life or career? Share your stories!"

"event","Suzanne Vega has self-released a new album, comprised of re-recordings of some of her most famous songs. I downloaded it last night and it's excellent. If you like folk/pop music, check <a href=""http://www.suzannevega.com/"">her site</a> or <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/close-up-vol-1-love-songs-deluxe/id351467778"">iTunes</a> for a listen. (The iTunes version has three or four more songs than the one she's selling herself; it also costs $2 more.)<br /><br />Vega had to go the unusual route of recording and releasing this album on her own, after her record label dropped her like a moldy piece of fruit. The great shame of the recording industry is that labels own the actual recordings of songs, even if the artist wrote the songs. Even if the label doesn't want to do business with an artist any more, they still own the copyright on the recordings, not to mention the physical masters of the songs. So the only way for Vega to really earn any money off of her back catalog was to re-record new versions of the songs and release them herself.<br /><br />Luckily, there are quite a few more options for artists releasing their own material today than there were back when I saw Vega live in (gulp) 1987. She can post the album on her own site, and iTunes allows independent artists to add albums to their store. <br /><br />One of my other favorite artists, Jill Sobule, took a very unusual route with her last album and asked her fans to finance it. Anyone who paid $10 to help record it got a copy of the CD&nbsp;when it was finished. People who paid a lot more were actually named in one of the songs on the album.<br /><br />I&nbsp;don't know how much Vega had to spend to record and release this album (especially since she's also put it out on CD), or where that money came from, but she's getting good press about it (including in this week's <em>New Yorker</em>), so hopefully it will earn out and keep putting food on her table.<br /><br />From what I've read, Vega plans three more of these acoustic re-record albums. Personally, I'd prefer new material, but I'll take what I can get and hope that her taking over distribution of her own music brings her more success than she got from the record companies."

I&nbsp;could have added another dozen titles to this list, and may still do so, but Amazon's database can only list so much detail on decade-old books.<br /><br />I&nbsp;really don't submit fiction or poetry to magazines these days. They're so ephemeral. They come and they go, and they're hard for readers to order. Having stories in books creates a bit more permanence, even if they rarely generate any additional royalties.<br /><br />(Websites are different. They tend to stick around. Again though, no royalties.)<br /><br />So anyway, if you're looking for any of my fiction or poetry, you now have a one-stop-shop for a good chunk of my work. Check it out.<br /><br />***<br /><br />(Fellow writers, if you haven't set up your own Amazon author page, I&nbsp;encourage you to <a href=""https://authorcentral.amazon.com"">do so</a>. It couldn't be easier, and it's a great way to promote yourself.)"

"event","A friend of mind just started her own blog and asked me how to promote it. I&nbsp;figured I'd share the advice with the rest of you...


You're already on the right path, in that you added the link to your blog to your Facebook profile. Don't be afraid to post a link to each post as you add them to your blog. Meanwhile, email people and let them know that the blog exists. 

I find my blog traffic increases whenever I post links on Facebook and Twitter (keywords drive traffic there), or when I reply to others' blog posts. (When you reply on other blogs, include a link to your site, and it will help increase your standing in web search engines.)

Other than that, just let it grow. You're developing good content, and that will keep bringing people back.

The main thing with marketing your blog and your writing is that you need to keep reminding everyone that you exist. They forget so easily...

Hope that helps!

I&nbsp;know this seems ironic to be posting blog-marketing advice on a blog I&nbsp;rarely update, but I&nbsp;have two professional blogs, and marketing yourself not only really helps, it's essential!

"event","I&nbsp;don't want an ebook reader yet, but looking at all of these books, comics, magazines, etc surrounding me, I&nbsp;know I'll be buying one eventually.<br /><br />My general feeling, as a reader and buyer, is that physical books can't be beat -- they're portable, re-usable, recyclable, tradeable, giftable, collectible, and just plain enjoyable. Nothing beats going to a bookstore or comic shop, or getting a box of books from Amazon, or opening up my mailbox to find the latest issue of <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>.<br /><br />But as a 40-year-old, lifelong consumer of books, I&nbsp;look at all of this <em>stuff</em> in my house and I&nbsp;know I'm going to be moving a few more times in my life. And that fills me with dread.&nbsp;Few things, my friends, are as annoying having to pack, move and unpack as an entire library full of thousands upon thousands of books and comic books.<br /><br />Meanwhile, knowing how many books and comics I&nbsp;already own puts a damper on my desire and willingness to buy <em>more</em> of them. My rule -- which I rarely actually keep -- is that every time I&nbsp;bring a new book or comic into the house, two books or comics should leave.<br /><br />Beyonf the sheer space required to have all of this stuff, there's also the stress brought up by being a collector. Even the slightest imperfections in my books drives me crazy. Bent pages or a scratch on the cover?&nbsp;AUGH!<br /><br />And of course, all of these things are printed on paper. Old books degrade and set off my allergies. Ick.<br /><br />So yeah, I&nbsp;love books, but I&nbsp;also find them kind of annoying. I'd much rather be able to have an entire collection sitting in a single device the size of a single hardcover book.<br /><br />Of course, ebooks can't be wrapped up as gifts, donated to the library, sold on eBay, admired as physical <em>objects d'art</em>, or autographed by my favorite writers or artists. So I&nbsp;know that even if I&nbsp;do buy an ebook reader, I&nbsp;won't be making the transition 100%. Maybe 50/50. Maybe 75/25. Who knows. <br /><br />All I&nbsp;know for sure is, I&nbsp;have a lot of stuff, and keeping it safe and organized is too much damn work. i'm ready for a change.<br /><br />What about you?&nbsp;To e or not to e?&nbsp;That is the question!"

Let's see how well I do.</li><li><strong>Green.</strong> I'd like one more regular &quot;green&quot;&nbsp;writing venue. Right now, I write three stories a week about endangered species and three more about green technology. But there are so many &quot;eco&quot;&nbsp;stories to tell. I'd like to be even more a part of that.</li><li><strong>Stuff.</strong> I've got too much of it. I'd like to cull 90% of my old videotapes&nbsp;(that's the only easy one on the list), a few hundred books, a bushel or two of old clothes, and at least 1,000 comics. </li><li><strong>Art.</strong> I&nbsp;must devote more time to drawing. Goal:&nbsp;50 single-panel cartoons. And I'd like to complete two new mini-comics this year. All of this is already written, I&nbsp;just need the time and devotion to complete (okay, start) the artwork.</li><li><strong>Health.</strong> My wrists and shoulders hurt like hell again. Gotta work on my posture and do my physical therapy exercises every day, without fail. Cuz if I'm in pain, none of this is possible.</li></ol>That's a pretty good list. Wish me luck!"

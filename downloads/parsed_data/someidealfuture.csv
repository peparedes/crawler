"event","So I'm starting to feel ok again. Its been 3 weeks. Wait, its been a shitty 3 weeks. I drink a lot more now.

I spent the past two days with two of my best friends in the entire world.
Amanda broke edge and drank with me, and tried to drunk dial Mike to harass him about breaking up with me.
I don't want him anymore though, now that he's hurt me the way he has.

Nick and I talked about getting tapeworms so we could be super skinny. 
We also tried to get this boy Bear to send me n00dz. 
I like talking to Bear, he went through an equally traumatic/bullshit breakup and we're both senile about dating.
I don't want to get attached to him though, I'd rather be single and strong on my own for a while.


I got tattooed today, and it was amazing. Colin at the tattoo shop above my work finally got a chance to work on me. Its hands down already my favorite tattoo. Its beautiful. Its absolutely perfect and I've never had anything as amazing. I'll have pictures soon. 


Two of my roomates are moving out. The landlord said she would be ok with me taking over the lease. Its a little intense, the financial responsibility will all be on me now. And, I need two roomates by september 1st. 
I'm excited that I might be able to finally clean this place up and have an awesome, clean house."

but now that everything is gone, what is there to find, where do I move forward? 

You know how people say, ""it's a small world""
well, it seems like everyone I know is connected, and I personaly want nothing to do with it.

I want to meet someone for once that doesnt know a single soul that I do.
I want to spend time with people who are different than what I know.
But how do you acheieve that when all most people want is the familiar?

I kinda feel like being a hermit. Closing up into my cave, and not sharing myself with anyone."

whatever. 

maybe it's because I'm happy for once and not complaining about something


It's strange feeling this content.

Working two jobs is hard, driving as much as I do is even harder... but falling asleep next to someone who makes me feel amazing is worth every mile I have to drive to get that.

Im surprised mostly by the fact that the excitement hasn't worn off yet. We have routine, we are comfortable as we could ever be around each other, but I still get ecstatic when I get to be around him.
It's strange, feeling this good.


In other news, when I went to Kurt Halseys new gallery this past week, I bought a new print, and he drew a sketch of Penny on it, when we were talking about our cats that have left us this past year (r.i.p. kittiesss). I am seriously in love with the fact that even though shes gone, I now have something even more profound to remember her by.

I've also been going to the gym for the past few weeks, as many times a week as I can go, and I quit smoking. I feel like my body should feel strong, and flexible, and clean. Not sluggish and weak like it has for the past year or so. I dont even care if I lose weight, I just want to feel healthy."

"event","I started a new job today, at a tight salon in west hollywood.

It was fucking horrifying. I havn't started a new job, with all new people, in over two years. Even when I moved back down here from seattle, people I had worked with at newport ulta were working at huntington ulta(where i'm still at now).

I got the worst anxiety on the way there, and it didn't go away all day. 
I guess I'm just nervous because ever since I started hair school I dreamed about being at a salon in LA. I guess I just have these huge expectations that I will excell up there for some reason, and I'm terrified that I might not be able to produce the results I want.

Not to mention, on my fabulous first day, I sat around the damn shop for about 6 hours with absolutely nothing to do and no clients, and the one client I did get was a crazy lesbian chick who appeared to never have shaven her armpits, that indulged herself in an extra-long, sensual hug with me before she left. And her hair was an absolute mess to try and fix, so it was highly nerve-racking to deal with while everyone was watching what I was gonna do with it.

I'm scared of change in general. I'm especially scared of this change. I'm scared of not getting enough clients. 

I guess all I can do is be patient, and and appear as fearless as possible, and work my ass off. I'm pretty much giving my life away to the hair industry, since I will be working 7 days a week at two different salons about an hour away from each other. 


wish me luck. I'm really, really gonna need it."

 Nicole and I were at chain reaction, when a series of strange events occured.

 We were sitting in my car with the doors open, having a cigarette, waiting for skarlett and who came up to each door but two motherfuckers with bandanas on?

 The one on my side started shoving a gun in my lap, and started yelling at us to give him our money.
 
We're poor bitches, so we told them we didn't have any money, which was true.

 So they went for our sidekicks.

 Bitch please, you know I would gladly give my life to protect my sidekick.

 We started defending the kicks in our hands, the guy on my side was trying to steal my car keys as well, and all I could think was, ""you don't honestly think ill give up my tiffanys keychain"".

 Nicole stood up and started yelling and they ran away, after she told him to shoot her.

 true story.
 I'm freaked out.
 I thought he was gonna shoot my leg off.
 Moral of the story? Don't sit in your car at chain reaction."

WHO CAN RESIST THE SPICE GIRLS, A BOY BAND, HARRY POTTER, AND CUDDLING w/ A BLANKET WITH MY NAME ON IT AND ME UNDERNEATH??????

"event","the other day someone brought to my attention if i want a boyfriend i should be less picky and maybe give some guys a chance. why would i ever do that?? and it seems that even if i am picky, mainly meaning if im shallow, i end up with douches, and if im not picky i get assholes that dont treat me right.

im sick and tired of searching so hard when i know theyre right under my nose... that person that ive been searching for forever... and although i dont know who he is quite yet i know hes going to come and be part of my life at the most inopprotune moment, when my life is complete hell and gunfire, and we wont stand a chance. Either that or he will dump me cause hes not ready. JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER GUY.
am i really that intense in a relationship that guys flee once they see how i act?? when all i reallly want is just to have someone to hold and to marvel at??

i want more friends. im craving new people. I cant stand the kids i go to school with, and with selina gone, and dez too, im going to have no one like me left to spend time with. Im craving relationships

i guess it doesnt help right now everything is just fucking mediocre. not wonderful, not bad, but plain. nothing to make me happy and nothing to make me sad. honestly, with my personality, i would rather be on one end or the other, give me something to cope with and ill cope, give me something to do and ill do it. just not this..."

"event","Sel, you are my life. You made cali cali. It wouldnt, and it wont, ever be the same without you. You are my best, and I love you more than anyone ive ever had the pleasure to meet. You are there when I cry and I cant stand anything, and your there when all i can do is smile like a goon and have no other way of expressing my happyness but by dancing like a shitty ass robot. You make fun of how i dance, and sometimes i sing like crap compared to you, but you will NEVER see how much you mean to me. and even though sometimes we have been kinda distant, we still find a way to come back to each other. No one else matters like you do and I can not express how much i love the memories we share. You have been more of a friend to me than anyone else EVER has, no one compares to you. When you leave your takin a part of my heart with you, that no one else could ever have, and your bringing it back soon or else i dont know what i'll do. Im going to be calling you in the middle of the night and im going to be texting you like theres no tomorrow, but seriously, I will still always be your best. You and i are like waffles and cigarettes, they look EXCELLENT on us hahaha. you mean EVERYTHING to me.

Im really proud of myself. ive become mundane!!! hahaha i love not going to class. or going late. or not doing homework. paybacks a bitch though, my grades suck. I dont want to go to work tomorrow. 


i have yet to make an impact on any one boy lately. kinda bugs. i hate not being the center of attention. bens bday is next week. i hope i get to see him. 

i want to make out with a certain boy from la at selinas going away party on friday, or do much much more. i wouldnt mind being his girlfriend either. fuck hes beautiful. 

i still miss sonny. i dont care if he knows, i never really felt for a kid like i did for him. he was something completely different, but at the same time, he was exactly the same mistake i keep making


i gotta go to anatomy. to all of you, au revior. and hit me up on myspace. its felt lonely there lately"

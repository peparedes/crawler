"event","<font color=""blue"">I was driving to WAL*MART toda<b>y</b>, and listening t<b>o</b> p<b>u</b>blic radio.. they said po<b>w</b>er was out and aff<b>e</b>cting businesses on the east side of town.  So I assumed WAL*MA<b>R</b>T was one of th<b>e</b>m.  Sure enough <b>t</b>he parking lot was nearly empty but I <b>h</b>ad gon<b>e</b> all that way, so I wanted to make something out of it.  So I sat in the parking lot and just wat<b>c</b>hed <b>h</b>ow many pe<b>o</b>ple would get out of their car, help their kids out of the car, put them in <b>s</b>hopping carts and walk all th<b>e</b> way to the door and be told that the store was closed u<b>n</b>til the p<b>o</b>wer came back o<b>n</b>.  That parking lot is usually full and you hav<b>e</b> to park far away.  Wouldn't you realize that when you see all the WAL*MART employees standing outside, people walking back to their cars empty handed and the empty parking lot?  I heard one lady from outside my car, ask a associate how long the power would be out.. because they would know.. I don't know, it was sorta amusing for a half hour.

Jill went over there after work.  Saturday night, I met up with Rick and Mindy at Rick's house..  Mel and Bob went there after they had some Khan's.  We played a word game on the computer.. and watched the Family Guy Movie and hung out.  Nice relaxing time.  Thank you guys for the presents, They are all awesome!  But you got way too much.  Thank you though! <img src=""http://www.carbonize.co.uk/Yahoo/Smileys/4.gif""> I hope yall want to go out next weekend and do something..

Tonight I went over to my grandparents and had some cake.  It was good!  Chocolate cake with caramel filling and Cool Whip frosting.  Mmm.. I'm bringing some of that for lunch tomorrow... hells yeah!

Tomorrow I get to call up my car insurance company and have them change my policy.  I'm gonna get a huge discount, reduction on my insurance policy.  I can't wait. 

But just wanted to say thanks to them guys and such.  It's been a good b-day so far, and it's not even here yet.

naga nooch!

Things seemed to be alot easier and slower paced.  The coolest toys existed, you got the whole summer off from school, and didn't have any obligations.  We were all so innocent and understanding then.  If you want to come with, I have room for 2 more.  I'm leaving tonight at midnight.  get ahold of me somehow.

So long,

"event","<font color=""blue"">I was really looking forward to hanging out with friends tonight. But I have gotten sick.  I have a huge head cold.  I woke up around noon today, but went right back to bed and got up around five o'clock.  I have been completely worthless today, got nothing accomplished except for watching National Treasure tonight.  Great movie.  I love things about History.  Last night I met Rick at Wendy's and we ate some dinner and looked around Best Buy for a while.  I got a new cope of Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack.  We went to his house and he let me use his wireless internet.  Dang, things load and download fast!  I got about 80 songs downloaded in no time.  Thanks Rick.  Bob and Mel came over after they were at TC's.  I drove home around 1:30ish and nearly died about 10 times for falling asleep.  I was almost home and the last time I nodded off, when I opened my eyes and almsost hit a skunk.  So I swerved almost off the road and then I was totally awake for the last mile home.  I don't want my car to smell like skunk.  But now the interior smells like skunk.. great.

Coach Jimmy's got money, but not much.  I'm so poor right now.  Shit. Oh well.. When in Rome.

hope everyone is having a fantastic weekend.</font>

ok, I layed down to take a short nap around 4 pm.. and it's now a little after midnight.. what the heck?!?  I wasn't tired.. or maybe i was.. I have found that having a fan on, while I am sleeping, puts me in a coma.  Don't know why that is.  oh well.

I am going to have to get a second job.  There's just something about staying busy during the fall/winter..  I want to get things paid off, and such.  Any ideas where I should apply?  I am just looking for a part time job, just to make a few hundred dollars more a week.  or as much as I can get :).

Dang.. I have been playing a lot of Xbox lately, mostly Battlefront.. That is the first Xbox game I ever bought, and it still isn't getting old.  Battlefront 2 is coming out November 1st, the same day as Revenge of the Sith's DVD.  That will be an expensive day.  

This weekend was fun!  Friday night, I met Mel and Bob at Sidelines and had some dinner.. then we went to Matt's party.  The band was ok, but they didn't know the words to ""Sweet Home Alabama..""  who doesn't know the words to that?!?!?.. I didn't get home until 4am, which was 24 hours after I got up for work... so I was a little tired..  Saturday, I went over to Matty's Uncle's house, and watched him and his uncle play chess for about 3 hours..  that got kind of boring.. why invite me over watch that, and not include me..  I was a little pissed, but I guess I'm over it now.  After that I raced down to Mel and Bob's and we watched Viva La Bam.. and had some good chips.  good times.  Sunday, I went back over to Matt's and we watched some TV.. Family Guy was on.. that show is always funny!

I bought Sin City yesterday.  Damn! that movie was awesome.  I guess I'm mostly looking forward to owning Revenge of the Sith on DVD.  It could very well be, my most favorite movie of all time.

OH!.. The teen choice awards were on yesterday.  and Jon Heder (Napolean Dynamite) won for something, I can't remember.  But he said, in Napolean's voice. 'I wish you girls would cheer for me, like you cheered for Jesse McCartney.. more like Jesse McFartney.' he is so freakin funny!

Thursday tomorrow..

Bowling Friday.

I love weekends!

hope everyone is having a great week!

"event","<font color=""blue"">Today was a shitty day at work.  I joke around with co-workers about quitting... well we all do... but today, I was 99.999999% on my way into the bosses office and telling him to ""go fuck himself"".  But that's not me.  I am not a person who would do that.  I tend to keep things to myself, I know I probably shouldn't.. but I find it easier to fix problems on my own.  I don't know if it's because nobody cares, or if I can fix it faster, because I know the source.  I feel bad, because I was a real prick to a few people today.  I am usually not a prick.  I just hope tomorrow will be better and I can avoid my boss for most of the day.  There are only a few people at work who can make my day better.  I'm glad they are there, or I would probably be fired or I would be an asshole.  When I got home today, I was bitching about work.. my mom said a few things..  and it made me realize, some things are not so bad, and could be worse.  I love my mom.  She's cool.  hope everyone elses week is going great!

"event","<font color=""blue"">Well this was a fun weekend

Friday night we had Mel and Bob's wedding rehersal.  After that, the whole wedding party went to Buca.  That place has some awesome food!!!...  we sat around a huge table, in the Pope room.  There was a bust of the Pope in the center of the table.  He watched all of us eat.  

Saturday, was the wedding.  FUN!.  It was fun walking with Jill, I hope i didn't annoy her too much :) .. or anyone else for that matter.  Good food at the reception!  The cake was awesome!..  Reception dances are always great too!  My legs and feet were so sore at midnight.. i stumbled out with Jill and Josh, *(thanks for bringing me back to my car)*...  I was happy to be a part of their wedding.  It was a very fun, and enlightening event.

Today I got up early and brought my tux back to Men's Warehouse, my brother and I went to Best Buy for a while as well.  got some stuff and came home.  Later this afternoon, we went to see <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>.  It's hilarious and SO GOOD!...  I can't wait to get that on DVD.  and we also got to see the trailer for <i>Corpse Bride</i>.. another Tim Burton flick coming out.. looks like <i>Nightmare Before Christmas</i>.. yesss!

I have tomorrow off, so I think I will be sitting around..  I'm actually gonna have a day off.. YESSS!!!.. I love days when I can just sleep in, and sit around.. who doesn't?

hope everyone else is doing well..  <i>""aisha yana""</i>

Well it is now official.  I am going to be broke for the rest of my life.  I left work a half hour early today, so I could go get some brake pads installed on my car, and pay some bills.. I'm thinkin'.. $100 for the brake pads.. I can do that...  Well.. NOPE!.. more than just the brake pads.  about $930 worth.  <b>SO</b>.. here's me.. back at square one.  I am not going to pay $930 to fix that shit.  I would rather put $930 down on a <b>new</b> car... So..  I'm in the car shopping market.  Brand new.. fuck that used car shit..  In the mean time, I have to drive my brother's car (the one I drove in high school), which I don't trust to get me places at all.  Would have been nice to still have that $745 I paid for the belts to get fixed... and the $300 for the Air Conditioning to get fixed...  what a huge chunk of payments that could have been.  *sighs* I can never catch a break...

There goes my plans for... wait..  no... I am gonna get my own place, even if I am in debt.  I can do it.  There are things more important that getting DVDs and gadgets and trinkets... I have plenty already.  I got so much shit.. and for some reason... I love living cheaply.. like generic foods.. coupons.. ""buy 1 get 1 free - type things"".. sounds amish, or ghetto, but I don't care..  I might as well take out some more loans too, for school... get more in debt..  there's no getting around it... 

I'm a BITCHER..
Bitching helps sometimes... 

As long as I have my Sidekick, Sirius Radio, and <u>a</u> car, I will be happy.. life offers more than those things... but I guess I'm not in a position for such things yet...

Sorry If I Am A Bitch..

I'm me..

"event","<font color=""blue"">For the past few days, i have been feeding the animals at my neighbors, because they have been gone during Memorial weekend.  They live on a farm, and I was told to only feed the dog, and cats, so thats what I have been doing.  I go over there today and I feed them and I am about to leave, and I hear a loud noise coming from the barn.  So I start walking towards the barn and 3 huge pigs come running out ... and I'm like ""Oh SHIT!!""  So I spent about an hour and a half chasing pigs.  Let me tell you, pigs are non-negotiable.  They are slow runners, but it's hard getting them to walk through a regular size doorway.  They aren't used to running, so a few times they would lay down and try and catch their breath.. well I guess I did too.  friggen pigs.

I just got done mowing the lawn.  I'm beat.  What movie should I watch?...  I know!

Things are changing again.  

Work is getting...  Well on Friday I went in to find out that someone in our department got fired.  My boss told me who it was, and <b>i</b>t's the guy they just hired about a mo<b>n</b>th and a hal<b>f</b> ago.  He helped out on the dock, to l<b>i</b>ghten up the work-<b>l</b>oads.  So now, we're back to being under-s<b>t</b>affed, because he is gone, and anothe<b>r</b> l<b>a</b>dy in our depar<b>t</b>m<b>e</b>nt has been gone for months, fighting cancer.  It would be nice to get Alex out of the offices and helping on the dock<b>.</b>  He is back for the summer.  Friday was a half-day of work, so that was nice.

Fri<b>d</b>ay night I w<b>e</b>nt over to Mike'<b>s</b> and hung out with him and his girlfriend.  We went to the Mall of America and looked around.  After that, we met up with Matt (a differen<b>t</b> Matt than I usually talk about) and he went out and we all just talked about things going on in ou<b>r</b> lives, and they had some pretty good advice f<b>o</b>r me and I had some pretty good advice for them.  It almost feels like I am a changed person after hearing what they had to say.. (no I'm not ga<b>y</b>).  It's about other things, irrelevant to write about in here.  I guess some things can change for the good, for me at least, which is very rare.  

Satu<b>r</b>day, I went to the Mall of Am<b>e</b>rica, again with Rick.  I bought the Making of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, <b>b</b>ook.  Did you know that if you don't use evasive action while yo<b>u</b> walk through the mall, people will walk right into you, and it's totally your fault.  All <b>i</b>n all, that mall is great for ""people watching"".  And do I ever <b>l</b>ove Caribou Coffee? Heck yes I <b>d</b>o.  Watched the Harry Potter: And the Goblet of Fire trailer in the Apple store.. looks great!  We saw Mindy and her mom shopping there.  We hung out at Rick's after that, Mindy and Jill came over.  Jill said, <i>""Daddy, I'm freezing! Will you show me how to build a campfire?""</i>  and I said <i>""ooh Campfire?""</i> (with a japanese accent).  So I built a campfire, with the help of some lighter fluid.  We heard raccoons fighting in the trees also and I knocked over some flowers.  Just great.

I am just lazing around today.  I get to see Star Wars<b>:</b> Revenge of the Sith again tonight!  I can hardly wait.  this will be my 4th time.  It surely doesn't get old.  In fact, in my opinion, it is the best of all six.  It all ties in so perfectly, and it's just a beautifully made film.  The people who hate the dialogue, oh well.  You <b>c</b>an ma<b>k</b>e <b>y</b>our own series of films and let's see how they turn out.  

I get tomorrow off, and I ain't doing <i>shit</i>.  I am just going to sleep in, and relax, rarely do we get days off and I love sleeping in, so there.

What should I do now?... I think I am going to put in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Haven't watched that in a long-o-time.  Hope your weekend is going well.

later.

I am working right now, freakin' bored.  It's noon and I haven't stopped to take a break yet today.  I am just waiting for the help to get back from lunch, so I can get some.  I'm starving.. *blah*..  I am done working at Roseville, thank god.  Last friday I was on my way to work and my car just stopped working, while i was going 70MPH.  So i had to get it towed and fixed.  $745 later, I had my car back.  So I am piss broke too.  I am going to be looking for a second job, I wonder why I am even considering that.. I need money, but 8 hours of work is enough for me. in the past when I have wanted a second job, I never got around to applying.

well, not much more to report.. but 36 hours, until Star Wars.  Yippie hooray.

hope everyone is having a great week.  give me a call..

I haven't been online in a lonnng time.. well not long enough to do this.  So here goes.

Work-  I wanna retire.  But I suppose I am a little too young to consider that, so I will have to deal.  I have been working at the Roseville location for the last 2 days, helping to get every last pallet out of there.  It seems like it will never end.  I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel though.  It's kinda nice working at my own pace though, I don't have to stop everything to help a truck driver every two minutes, so I can actually finish my work.  My bosses tell me I am doing ""phenomenal"" work.  So we will see if the paychecks go up.  That would be nice.  Aveda offers reimbursment for schooling that applies to something work related there.  So I am looking into taking advantage of that.

My brother came home last weekend.  He *sighs* ... he is so self-conscious.  Everything is about him.  I don't want to go into anything, but it just gets old.

I got a Sirius Satellite Radio.  It's nice to listen to commercial-free music whenever I go somewhere.  I hear different songs, and not the same ones over, and over again.  It's nice.  I suggest getting one.

A little more than a week until Star Wars III.  Can't wait.  I just want to see it without anything else being ruined, I want to enjoy it. I know I will, but even so.  

Wow! I have 4 new pillows now!  and they are cold!  heck yes they are!

The Chronicles of Narnia looks like its going to be good.

I should go read Goblet of Fire, or go watch Phantom Menace...  either would be fun.

This weekend is going to be busy.. matt and I are gonna do somethin, and I have a wedding to go to on Saturday.  so good times all around.

hope everyone is doing fine, and having a pleasant week ^^

I have been really freakin' busy lately.  Work has been extremely busy.  I drove up to Moorhead, MN last Friday to visit my brother and bring some things home for him, since he is graduating.  It's about 4 hours away, and 250 miles.  I love road trips even the little ones like those.  Just to get away, you know?.. On my way back I stopped in Motley to see my friend Charlie, his wife and baby.  He has such a nice house, he has about 15 chickens, 5 goats, 2 pigs, 2 dogs, 2 cats, 1 bird and 1 aquarium of fish.  I was feeding his goats some sunflower seeds.  <i>""Baaa!!!""</i>  They had to go to a funeral so I left early, stopped at Treasure City... that place is freakin' awesome! all sorts of nicknacks... got home, took a little nap and went to Old Chicago, with the crew.  good times.  

Lately I have been listening alot to movies scores and such.  I am mostly anticipating the soundtrack to Revenge of the Sith, which comes out in 1 week.  I simply cannot wait... well I can,.. but.. you know...  

Sweet it's raining out right now.. another thing to keep this room cold.. I love cold pillows and sheets.. they are the absolute best.

I have freakin' poison ivy on my arm.. it itches like a mofo.  it was swollen and oozing.. sounds great eh? I have it covered with medicine, gauze pads and a self-adhering bandage.  its healing nicely.

Next sunday I have to go back up to Moorhead for graduation.. *sigh* 2 weekends in a row.. but i wanna be there for by bro, ya know?...

I hope everyone is having a great week!

they will mail your information to everyone.  I got a bill today, for $130.  I have never used the card, and I just got it about a month ago.  The bill was very vague, didn't say who was billing me.  It didn't have why I owed that.  So I called the 1-800 number on the bill.  Some lady picks up.  just asks for my name, no account info and such.  I asked her why they are billing me for the $130.  She told me it was an annual fee for the Best Buy card.  <i>what?!?</i>  Best Buy doesn't have an annual fee for their card.  She asks if I am able to make a payment over the phone or mail in?.. I ask her ""can't I just go into any Best Buy and make a payment?.. Isn't there a customer service for doing that in every Best Buy?"".. she said ""No you have to do it by phone, internet, or mail in""  ok with this information I told her, ok  ""I'm not paying this because <b>A.</b> I have never used the card, <b>B.</b> I have not even had the card for 1 month, <b>C.</b> There are no annual fees for having a Best Buy Card, and <b>D.</b> Any Best Buy will let you make a payment at the store.""...... so she says ""I will transfer you to customer care so you can cancel this account, please hold"".... 30 seconds go by, I hear the recorded operator ""If you would like to make a call..blah, blah, blah"".. she hung up on me..  ok now I was more pissed, so I called back.  I got the same lady.  Now I'm thinking of Punch Drunk Love, if anyone can see the analogy to that.  I tell her to cancel my card.  She transfers me again... she tries 3 times, and says ""Oh that department must be closed right now, I can put in a request to cancel your account, and reverse this bill since you haven't used the card.""  HMMM... most bill companies don't give up that easy, they make your ass pay it. I say ""ok whatever"" and hang up.  I call the Best Buy number on the back of my card and the guy tells me ""there is no annual fee""

isn't this kind of thing considered illegal?.. i feel don't sorry for the idiots who have paid this ""fake fee"".

I'm calling again tomorrow, to make sure whatever that shit is, got reversed, and that they know, I'm not paying for it.

that's just my rant of the day. sorry if anyone read this..

have a good night/week

Nooch

Not been up to, too much lately.  Working has come back to its evil roots, from where it started.  Lies, deceit, creating mistrust are their ways now.  But I won't get into that.  It's not worth it.  Lately I have been sitting in my room either listeing to music or reading.  I'm trying to take it easy.  I go out often and usually spend too much money.  I am in the conserving-mode now, and I need to adapt so I can get a place of my own.  I also need to get my ass back into school, before it's too late.  I want to go back, but I also like being debt-free for the most part.  I suppose finishing school would pay off in the long run, so It's definately worth going back.  The weather has been awesome the last 3 days.  It's even a little humid, bring on summer!..  

Easter was kind of a slap in the face this year.  I set my alarm to get up at 6:am so I could go to church with my mom, but I over slept and woke up at 10:am.  she was just getting home and she was quite angry with me.  I tried explaining that my intentions were to go with her, but she wouldn't listen.  We went to my grandma's and grandpa's (on my mom's side)for lunch, my aunt and cousins were there too.  After that we went to my Uncle's house (from my dad's side), and my other grandma and some more relatives were there. I got really quite upset, when my grandma just kept ripping on me, for me being me, and the way I do things differently.  I just wanted to hang out with my cousins, whom I haven't seen forever, and don't get to see very often, but I couldn't even do that.  All this was after I spent all afternoon with her the day before in the nursing home, because her doctor told her that she couldn't take care of herself anymore.  She is only going to be there until she can get into assisted living.  But all I wanted to do on Easter was to spend the day with my family, and by 6:pm, I just wanted to go home.  can't win 'em all, eh?

I took this Friday off of work, because of all the drama and changes going on there. So I can't wait for that.  

There is so much shit changing, yet some things never change.  Could I speak in anymore of a riddle?  I don't know what to talk about anymore. It doesn't even matter.

hope everyone else's week is going good!

Friday, is 2 hours, 24 minutes and 14 seconds away.  I can hardly wait.  I'm sitting here drinking Pepsi One and eating peanuts.  num.  you know, Pepsi One has a <i>""Great New Taste""</i> .  It tastes exactly the same as before.  Dirty Rotten Liars!!!  you scum! you pukes! don't tell us there's a <i>""Great New Taste""</i>, when there's not!  These peanuts are fantastic.  they are of the <i>""honey roasted""</i> variety.  I'm eating one right now.  It's great.  Little bit sweet, little bit salty.  evens it out a little.  I just had another drink of Pepsi One.  it still tastes the same.  I bought some ""Total"" cereal today.  It tastes a little like my favorite, ""Wheaties"".  I guess there is 100% Daily Values of 12 Vitamins & Minerals in ""Total"". such a sweet victory!  Yes, I now totally know, there is no <i>""Great New Taste""</i> in Pepsi One, from this last taste.  Trust me on this.  I've been thinking.. was Sergeant Slaughter a WWF Wrestler or on G.I. Joe, because I seem to remember him on both, but that was years ago.  If I were ever to make a movie starring Steven Segal.. I would totally have someone kick his ass... he never loses.. and Chuck Norris!.. tough guys.. not so tough behind the camera.  They won't be heroes anymore, when they're missing a few teeth.  Same old taste again.. bah.. Maybe I could have Sergeant Slaughter kick both of their asses simotaniously.  then we'll see who the real hero is.  nooch to that.  What the hell ever happened to those Troll dolls, that were always naked with huge hair.  Those things were weird.. but cool?.. or not?.. i don't know.. they're freakin Troll dolls... If Bruce Lee was still alive, he could kick Chuck Norris' ass.. for real!.. Bruce and Slaughter could tag team Chuck and Steven.. that would be a fight to remember.  No. I got it.. John Lithgow from 1985, would kick Chuck and Steven's ass.  definately.  These peanuts are the madnote.  I'm going to have another Pepsi One too.. be right back.  ok back!  I grabbed a Strawberry Sparkling Water instead, they are just as good, if not better.  MMM that is gooood!  i've rambled a bit too much.. but there is a rare look at what Jimmy thinks about when he's bored.  Goodnight!

another busy work week..  Lately, things have been not too bad for me at work.  It gets busy and frustrating sometimes, but if I can stay busy, the day goes much faster.  Just today, I was commended for my work, from the two people that drive me the craziest, my bosses of course.  in a follow-up review.  I came home and took a long nap.. naps are so tasty... 

Nothing much new.  This weekend I think we are doing sum-thing for Mel's birthday, should be fun!  Saturday, Jill asked if I could help her move a piano, into her new apartment.  so i'll be helping with that... and.. <i>""I too am in the framing business""</i>, for I have been looking at apartments.  I found one, that I am going to call tomorrow for availability.  just a 1 bedroom with kitchen/bathroom, nothing special.  I am looking, because I am never home, when I am, I just sit in my room, because there is nothing else to do.  I am always in that area anyways, wheather it be ""working"" or ""out on the town"". and I don't have many bills anymore, so <i>""Wynaut""</i>!?

I've been watching alot of <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> and <i>Chappelle Show</i>, they're hilarious!

can't think of much else to write about... hope everyone is having a good week..

I am so freakin' hungry and dehydrated right now...  I can't eat or drink anything, because I've thrown up 7 times in the last 4 hours.. (interesting eh?)  anything i eat or drink will come right back up..  plus i have a huge headache from doing that all day..  what a day..  I seriously doubt i will be making it in to work tomorrow..  I don't care what the boss says either.. i am 150% miserable... oh well.. enough with the bitching, eh?

Friday, I met up with Mel, Bob, and Jill at T.G.I.Fridays.. went to best buy afterwards, got 'SAW', and Sum41's cd, i can't think of the name of the CD, for I am too out of it now to even look it up..  it's not Chuck, and it's not Half Hour of Power, if that helps.  headed home afterwards..

Saturday, I hung out at Matt's and an old friend was there. with like a million ICP tatoos.. hehe.. came home after that

Sunday, met up with Rick to get some food, and went to WAL*MART, for a bit... spent way too much..

Today, had President's Day off, but was sick the whole day.. I hope everyone is having a good week so far!!!

<u>Friday Night- </u>Mel, Bob and I went to eat at the Moonrock Bar & Grill (I think that's what it's called).. food wasn't that bad..  Mel and I played a few rounds of Mario Party 5, stupid Koopa Kid kicked our ass.
<u>Saturday- </u>I headed to the Mall of America around noon to look for some clothes, didn't get any clothes, just ended up walking around and people watching.. <i>""I love the smell of commerce in the morning!""</i>..  I bought a CD (<i>HIM - Love Metal</i>).  It's really good!..  Rick met up with me around 3:ish?  i think.. We found Holly and... girl?.. eating at a restraunt.  We left and went to Khan's for some din din.  Moonlight bowling was next, it was Mel, Bob, Jill, Josh, Kendra, Rick, Alex, Heather, and myself... I got 1 chance to win money through out the whole night, and I didn't win.  but all in all, it was fun!.. Alex came bowling, that was cool.  After bowling we headed to Mel and Bob's to hang out, we played some cards and such... it was a fun night!.. I left around 6:am, and went to bed at 7:am.. sunday..
<u>Sunday- </u> I got up and headed to Matty's to watch the Super Bowl, that was cool, we were switching from Super Bowl, to America's Funniest Video's, some of the videos sucked, but a few of them had me laughing..  came home, cleaned my room, and went to bed.
<u>Today (Monday)- </u> Work, ...blah..  need to win the powerball..  I car pooled with Kenni, that was cool.. came home from work, and my 2 Moby CD were in the mail!.. I put them in, and it's funny how some music can trigger some memories..  I used to have both these CD's but they both got scratched to hell, so I ordered them a week ago, and It's been a few years since I have listened to them.. they are quite good..

HUMP DAY! YAAAAY!  I am just sitting in my room and not a thing is going on.  I came home today from work, and stared at the ceiling for a few hours, and just listened to some music.  How fun is that?  

Last Friday night, I met Bob, Mel, Jill, and Josh at Acapulcos to have some dinner.. Mel and Jill each got a 45oz. Margarita, .. those were huuuuge!!!! like fish bowls..  Jill also got a ""wet burrito"".. which was lovely...  after that we all headed to Jill and Josh's to see Pippin,  I left at around 9:30, and headed to see Rick, and we ended up playing some Halo2 online.. which is super fucking fun!..  I went home around 1: and went to sleep...

On Saturday night: Bob, Mel, Jill, Kendra, and I went to the Aveda holiday party.  That was a good time,.. well I thought so anyways.  They gave everyone two free drinks and anything after that, you had to pay for it.  Creepy Art was taking pictures of all the girls there, and I heard from co-workers that they didn't like him taking pictures of their wives/girlfriends.  He really is a creep, and for anyone who doesn't know this guy.. watch ""One Hour Photo"".. that would sum it up pretty good.  Sorry Kenni, next time, I will do a better job of kicking some ass...  After the party, we all went back to Mel and Bob's, where Rick met us, and Jill left us.  We played some Mario Party 6, which wasn't a big hit, and some Mario Kart.. good ol' Gamecube ^_^.. Rick left and everyone went to sleep, I hung around in a daze for a few hours, and then left around 6am..  went to the Maple Grove WAL*MART, and was so out-of-it/tired/exhausted.. I don't remember what I bought or how I got home.. but I went to bed about 8am, and slept until around 5ish..

Sunday, I don't remember a single thing that I did,... I believe I watched Mtv for most of the time I was awake..  

2 more days until another weekend.. hope to see all yall!!!  hope everyone is having a great week!!!!

Friday night, was pretty much worthless. It snowed like crazy, and I couldn't even get out of my driveway to go anywhere.. so that was a 'stay at home' night.  Saturday, I got up early to watch the U.S. premier of Destiny Deoxys.. i highly enjoyed watching that, I was still tired so I went back to bed, when it was over. I woke around 3pm and ... I can't remember what I did but I somehow was at Best Buy at 5:30.. at 7 I met up with Jill, Josh, Bob, and Mel at T.G.I Fridays so we could get some food, and get over to moonlight bowl at the bowling alley.  At T.G.I. Fridays I offended Mel big time.. I'm sorry Mel, I'm turning into an asshole, like my dad.  that's not a good thing... seriously, you can punch me in the face...I feel bad about it..  Bowling was fun, my first time moonlight bowling.  I won $2, hooray!  went headed over to Mel and Bob's afterwards and hung out.  got home around 4am.   Sunday, good day to sleep in.. so I did.  I've been pretty much worthless all day. so back to work tomorrow.. yippie!

hope everyone has a great week!!!

because you never did.
i loved you, with all my heart.
you were my one, my only, and the only person i ever cared about.
and now i hate more than words can explain.
dont ever come near me again.

i cant even begin to explain how i feel about it in an entry this small,

So why didn't you fucking tell me?
Why did you cheat on me, so much?
I gave you everything, i bought you everything, I hung out with you almost everyday for over a year.
you are the fakest, sluttiest, most back-stabbing girl i have ever met.
Not only did you have to cheat on me, that wasn't enough for you.

You had to fuck over my best friend too.
Sarah was finally happy, FINALLY.
And you go over to her boyfriends house and suck his dick.
You are unbelievable, you fucking slut.

Do you know why you have more guy friends than girlfriends?
because people know you're easy.
i dont know how many times you cheated on me or how many boys you've fucked since we broke up, but it really just sickens me, you sicken me.

honestly, you are the worst person i have ever met.
You were perfect for about 9 months but i guess that was fake too.
I guess i only loved you because you acted exactly like me.
Now you just adapt and act exactly like whoever you're hanging out with because you lack any personality of your own.

dont even act like youre sad.

you are heartless.

I trusted you,
i trusted you, i was never jealous, i never had any second thoughts but i guess i should have.

I never thought once about cheating on you.
I just need a girl thats loyal and truly does love me,
she could look like a tree for all i care, as long as she is nothing like you.

dont blame me for anything, you treated me like garbage.
all i ever did was love you.
and now i never want to see your face again.
so go ahead and have as many boyfriends as you want, 
none of them will treat as good as i did.

i hate you with everything ive got.
so fuck you jackie.

i feel cold and empty and like i have nothing left.

i'll never here that sweet sound of that manevelont turbo starting to kick in hard in third gear at 3500 rpms.
and that damn camel jocky is driving her right now.
stroking her shifter, pushing her buttons, and the clutch going in and out, in and out.

i've never been this jealous before,
its hard seeing her with another guy.
this is by far the worst thing thats ever happened to me.

we were together for a year and a month,
and it was bliss while it lasted,
but the best things always have tragic endings whether you were meant to be or not.

well it was meant to be, but it did not last, but i'll think of you everyday.

this is my goodbye baby,
i'll be seeing you...

<h1>MAZDA MX6 GT F2T Turbo 
I love you --- 8/12/05-9/24/06"

my head, eyes, and face feel swollen and broken.
I have never really cried that much in my life, even when i was little.
But somehow i've managed to do it for the past 5 hours nonstop.


its terrible because i never knew her as just a friend and i never wanted to either.
something i took for granted the past couple months is now gone,
well over a year and now its gone.

it's hard to explain, 
but now its like every glass of water that was half full before is now half empty.
i'm not sure if i'll ever be able to look her in the eyes again, 
its hard enough for me just talking.
i can't think about anything or speak without bursting into tears right now, its that bad.



it's all too hard,
i'm just trying to exsist."

so no alexpalooza for any of us it looks like.
and i have to drive out to rochester to go to work until the new store opens in auburn hillz.

tight thing is, it brings me that much closer to getting my new car.
be it a swift gti, 323 gtx, or impulse rs.

i shall own the road with awd and turbocharged 1.6 liter power.

i'll still keep mx6 though as it pulls harder on straight aways than all those cars.

they are still hiring so talk to me and i might hook you up.

kill me.

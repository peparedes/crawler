Much fun was had this week, but Spring Break kind of sucks because it's such a teaser for summer.  Now we all have to drudge through the rest of the year until sweet sweet freedom.

Anyway, I am in kind of a music rut . . . I keep listening to the same stuff.  Any suggestions??"

I hate knowing that life would be so much easier if I would just get my stuff taken care of, and that I wouldn't be so stressed if I wasn't such a freakin procrastinator, but unfortunately . . . I am.  I really do want to get a lot of stuff done today though, so that I can relax and enjoy the rest of the break, which has so far been excellent:

Friday, Austin and I went out to dinner and then met up with Tara, Clayton, and Nic at Main Event to go bowling and play laser tag - both of which I sucked royally at but enjoyed nonetheless.

Yesterday Austin, Mark, and I went shopping, and I got three shirts and a skirt, and then went to their friend's birthday party.  It was fun but I was so tired at the end . . . plus I'm like a two-year old, I get grouchy when fatigued.  But beyond that, it was a very good day.

Anyway, I hope everyone else had a great weekend too!"

"event","So I was watching on the news today that a woman out jogging got hit by a car and killed, and they had no way to identify her except by finally checking the serial numberr on her Ipod and tracing it to the purchaser.  The anchor ended the segment by saying, ""Always remember, if you're exercising alone, carry some form of identification.""

Um . . . how about if you're exercising alone, MAKE SURE YOU LOOK BOTH WAYS??  I just found it quite strange that they only gave advice as to how to be prepared in case you DIE rather than how to avoid it altogether."

I got into a semi-fight in English today with someone over a part of <i>Crime and Punishment</i>.  Is it nerdy that the only confrontation I enjoy is through literary discussion?  

Just don't even answer that question.

Anyway, work started off sucky but ended up not being bad, and afterwards, Austin (the guy I'm dating from work, NOT Austin Wall, who I will always refer to as AWall to clear up any confusion) and I went for a walk and then watched ""50 First Dates"" at his house.  I'd never seen it, and it was really cute.


I'm just so happy with everything right now. :)"

"event","It appears that I have come crawling back to livejournal.  We all know I couldn't shut up about my life for too long!  But it certainly has been awhile.  I'm not going to even try to recap everything that's happened since my last entry, so we'll just start anew with today.

I just want to say that I looove when random strangers are just automatically friendly and nice.  I was at Mozart's tonight to finish reading <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, and when I was in line for the bathroom, this lady started talking to me, and we got into a whole talk about books we'd read and then colleges and whatnot.  Nothing life-changing, but she was just so friendly and outgoing for no reason, I was kind of taken aback.  The world needs more people like that!

Anyway, since that was the last thing I did today, I guess I'll work backwards.  Before that, I went to mass, which was really good.  I love all the masses during Lent, I feel so much more reflective.  I guess I should try to be like that year-round.  

Eh nothing else really exciting happened today.  Majestics, school, work . . . you know the drill.  9 days til spring break!"

"event","WHY AM I SO FLIPPING COMPETITIVE?!?!?


The worst of it is that I try to convince myself that I'm not, and then I breed even more competitiveness, if that makes any sense.  Probably doesn't, but such is my life.

Anyway . . . this past weekend was quite fun:

+lunch with Brent on Saturday
+shopping
+watching ""The Wedding Date"" with Kara
+visiting Bolles in her grounding
+seeing ""Tristan and Isolde"" with my sister (great movie)
+doing absolutely nothing on Monday and loving it

I kind of feel overwhelmed right now for no particular reason.  Maybe it's just the fact that I still have a semester to go when I feel like I'm already out of high school.  Is that normal?  I mean, does everyone else feel like they're already graduated?  I have to remind myself that I'm going to school every day for a reason.

Oh, sorry I forgot . . . THERE IS NO REASON.  IT'S A COMPLETE FORMALITY SO THAT I CAN GET A FRIGGIN DIPLOMA IN MY HAND.

Well, now I'm in a list making mood, so I'm going to make a list of all the things I have to look forward to this semester so that maybe I won't kill myself with impatience.

*New York with the Maji - Feb. 24
*Spring Break - March 11 or somewhere there abouts
*Spring Show - March 24
*Corpus Christi for my cousin's winging ceremony - sometime in March
*Prom - sometime in May
*Flipping Graduation - MAY 25!!!!

Ok so my next milestone is February 24.  That is a month and a week.  I can do it.


My apologies to all of you whose time has been wasted by reading this.

"event","This might make a lot of people angry or annoyed with me, but I feel driven to say it anyway.

Today I watched ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"" and it made me realize something.  People love movies like ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" and ""Harry Potter"" because they have many strong, courageous characters battling evil and trying to re-enforce what is good.  What we need to understand is that this is exactly what is happening in our world today.  There is an ongoing battle between good and evil, and frankly, evil wins quite often.  Just thinking about all the bad thoughts I've had about people, all the times I judged others, every cus word I've used, all the pride I harbor, and the thousands of other wrongdoings I've committed in my life makes me see that I myself have been so susceptible to the work of the devil.  That might sound crazy-religious and over-dramatic, but it's the truth.  Everytime I do one of these things, he wins a little bit more.  This is something we all need to come to grips with.  All those stories about brave warriors have to become a reality - we must become warriors ourselves.  We must not, however, look down upon others whom we judge to be sinners - aren't we all?  And don't we sin further when we judge others or fill ourselves with pride?  Despite our wrongdoings, God has an infinite love for us that no human can even comprehend.  I am about as far from perfect as you can get, yet He has blessed me over and over again with so many gifts, I couldn't begin to list them all.  But in return, I still keep sinning.

However, my hope is that I can be better, and my point in writing all of this is to kind of wake up.  Let's all stand together and fight the good fight.  I love you, and more importantly, so does Christ."

1. Wake up at 4 AM with my sisters and talk until 6, when we finally get my parents out of bed to go downstairs and open gifts!
2. GIFTS!  I feel really bad because I've been so spoiled this year.  But not bad enough to not enjoy it, my friends.  My main gift was this pair of shoes I've been really wanting, but I got a lot of other sweet stuff too.
3. BREAKFAST FEAST which I made, thank you very much.
4. SIMPSONS MARATHON WITH SISTERS because . . . well why not?
5. Running . . . eh ya know.
6. Playing with all my new toys!
7. Christmas dinner! (Linner really . . . we eat at 4)
8. ""The Producers"" with the Tripod + Brennan, at the Alamo Drafthouse . . . soo good.

I already knew I was accepted to St. Thomas, but now I know they're offering me a half-tuition scholarship, which is the most they offer, except for ONE full tuition scholarship that they sent me an application for.  It's nice to have those options but I reeeally don't want to go there.

Providence and Villanova have both accepted me!  I don't know anything about $$$ yet though, that'll be awhile.

Boston College didn't accept me for Early Action, but I still get to be reviewed again for Regular Decision.  Which is fine, but since Regular Decision gives no scholarships, BC is out.  Oh well.  I kind of saw that coming.

Stilllll waiting to hear from Loyola and St. Joseph's.  Hurry up you jerks!!!  :)


Anyway.  The break is still going wonderfully.  If ONLY it would just SNOW, but I guess that's a long shot.  Silly Texas."

Anyway, at the shootout, I had told him that I had applied there, and then today he came up to me and got my e-mail and told me he knew someone in the admissions office and would put in a good word for me/get me some contacts there.  I mean really, he doesn't even know me and he's taking the time to do that?  I was surprised he even remembered who I was.  I love nice people!

So anyway, Christmas Break, I <33333 you times 28457392!!!!  Everyone is home and all is right in the world!!!  Yesterday, Nathan and I went to eat lunch at this Japanese food place called Zen, which I was kind of afraid of but ended up being sooo good!  And I'm just so happy I have my best friend back!!!  So after that we just hung out and watched tv at my house for awhile, then I babysat til late.  OH, I also apparently suffer from INSOMNIA now.  Ask me what time I got to sleep last night. 

You: ""Claire, what time did you get to sleep last night?""

Ohohoh I'll tell you, my friend.  5:30 in the MORNING!!!  What?!?!  I mean, it's not necessarily a bad thing because I certainly got a lot of reading done.  But for heaven's sake, 5:30?  But that's neither here nor there.  As I said, Ashley and I went to the alumni game this morning, and it was quite cold but still fun.  I've just been pretty much bumming around all day, but Scotty and I are going to see KING KONG tonight, so that should be fun, and then I think Sara and I are going to Mozart's.  Ohhhh life <333

Oh Mr. Darcy, you are so dark and brooding and attractive.  The whole movie made me wish I lived back in those days, when people went to balls all the time.

"event","So the rest of my Thanksgiving break was suh-weet.  Let's take it one day at a time:

FRIDAY:
*Texas v. A&M game - a little disappointing? Yes.  I was expecting a landslide.  But there are a few good things about the game being as close as it was: first of all, the Horns got this shaky playing out of their system before the Big XII Championship.  Secondly, the coaches now have something to work with these guys on and can troubleshoot right in time for the big games.  And most importantly this:  the Aggies played their BEST game.  The Longhorns played their WORST game.  And we STILL won. :-D
*Harry Potter - I saw this with Tara, and it RULED.  Ahhh Cedric Diggory, why did you have to go?  You were so attractive.  Anyway, aside from that tragic loss, the movie was awesome.  I can't wait for the 7th book to come out.

SATURDAY:
*Library with Tara for government paper - pretty much fruitless but at least now I know how worthless the public library system is.  It wasn't til I got home that I found a website with everything I needed.  Irony's a biatch.
*FCA Shopping - I dragged Eric along to help me pick out stuff, because all the kids in our TBCH cottage are boys, and I don't know what's cool for pre-pubescent guys.  It was pretty fun, plus Eric ended up getting The Simpsons 6th Season for less than 20 buck I think.  Amazing!  I <3 Super Target.
*Downtown - Ashley, Justin, Mel, Nathan, and I all went downtown presumably to go clubbing but all the 18 and up places were too expensive, so we ended up just walking up and down 6th street for awhile, which was still pretty fun, except slightly depressing when you see all the druggies wasting their lives away. Anyway, then we went to Katz's, and I got the biggest dessert of my life - a HUGE piece of 5th Avenue Cream Pie - and finished THE WHOLE THING.  YES I am such a hoss (Haus?  You know what I mean)!!!  Coincidentally, we say Taylor, J.Glaze, and Edris all downtown too.  Small world.  After that, we all went back to Ashley's and K.Stew and Eric Kealey joined us to hang out for a bit.  Interesting fact: Eric COLLECTS SCHOOL IDs.  He seriously has a lanyard with like 20 random IDs that he's found.  Even some from Deerpark and Cedar Valley!  That guy has connections now.

TODAY:
*Breakfast - Brent and I went out to Kerbey Lane, and it was really cool to catch up.  I hadn't seen him since summer!  He seems to be way on top of things at UT, which is awesome and gives me hope for college survival.  Other intersting fact - had the first omelet of my LIFE!  It was good, too.
*Shopping - Shannon and I went to Sephora to pick out each other's Christmas presents, and then Victoria's Secret, where I bought lip gloss because they were having a sale - 3 for $10!  So obviously, I couldn't pass that up.  Sometimes I don't realize just how much I miss Shannon until we hang out, and then I'm like DON'T LEAVE ME!  But it was really fun and hopefully enough to get through to the break, if not earlier!

Since then I've pretty much just been doing homework/going to church/watching the Great American Cake Cook-Off on the Food Network.  It's been a GREAT weekend though, and I hope everyone else's was, too.  Have a good week at school - only THREE MORE!!!"

The break has been so fun so far!  Time for a RECAP:

Tuesday night was Bobby's party and then Stef Balser's party, both of which were quite fun.  At Bobby's, we watched the ENTIRE R. Kelly ""HipHopera"" which was both awful and glorious at the same time.  It's amazing to me that enough people actually thought that idea was great enough to work.  I mean really.  For those videos to have been made, there had to have been at least, ohhhh, 10 people who thought the idea was sheer genius.  Then like 100 who thought it was pretty good.  And then a lot of others who thought it was at least ok.  And then you have the rest of us, who, if I may quote R. Kelly himself, are ""sitting here like 'what the f***?'""

Yesterday, in a word, ruled.  Nathan came home and he and I went to the mall bc he needed a jacket, and he ended up with quite a stylish one I might say.  After that, I got with the Jackpot girls to go eat at Fuddrucker's and then to see ""Rent,"" which was WONDERFUL!  Some of it kind of shocked me, and there were parts that were a bit awkward but for the most part it was soooo good.  I love musicals, they are so energetic and fire up the soul!  Afterwards I was like ""I'M GOING TO BROADWAY!!!"" but then realized after about 5 seconds that the fact that I can't sing might hold me back a little bit.  Dang it.  Anyway, after that, Kara and I headed off to hang out with Nathan, Austin, and Mel at Ashley's house for a bit.  I love having everyone home for the break!

Today was WONDERFUL!  Thanksgiving is the best.  My brother, sister-in-law, aunt, uncle, cousin, cousin's fiancee, and cousin's fiancee's sister all came over to eat, and even with all those people, the fridge is still full of leftovers.  After dinner I took a nap while everyone watched football and then later we all just sat around the living room and my dad, brother, uncle, and cousin played guitar and we all sang.  The best was when we all rocked out to ""Say it Ain't So,"" and by we, I mean only my sisters, cousin, and brother, but it was awesome.  I love my family so much!  I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving too!  Get ready for the game tomorrow . . . prepare to get smashed into the ground, Ags.  Hook 'em :)"

Today was pretty sweet . . . took senior portraits for the yearbook . . . pretty sure I blinked in every one of them.  Such is life.  Anyway, Tara and I went to the lacrosse scrimmage against Bowie, and of course our boys beat the crap out of them!  Ah, I love being on the winning side.  After that game of glory, Bolles and I went out to eat downtown at Milto's, and then went to Toy Joy, where I got this sweeeeet ninja launcher.  That's right . . . it's a little gun that you load ninja figurines into, and then it shoots them at people in stealth-ninja-attack fashion.  Possibly the most worthy investment I have ever made.

<P>SUMMARY:<BR>All the schools were great, the fall weather up there is gorgeous, and my favorite two universities were Providence College and Loyola.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""ridiculously long, detailed, and most likely uninteresting version""><P>THE LONG VERSION</P><P>My mom and I arrived in Baltimore late late Thursday night and went straight to my mom's BFF Mary's house, and immediately went to sleep.</P>
<P>FRIDAY: We woke up early, and Mary drove us to Philadelphia to visit Villanova and St. Joseph's.&nbsp; Villanova had a really great spiritual sense around the whole campus, but I didn't really like the location . . . it was kind of just there on the side of the road.&nbsp; Still a great school though.&nbsp; After that we went to lunch and then&nbsp;headed to St. Joseph's, which had a lovely campus, but otherwise was not terribly impressive.&nbsp; Not bad though.&nbsp; After that, we headed back to Mary's house in Baltimore, where I babysat her flipping adorable youngest son, Pat (10) while my mom and Mary went out to eat, until Mary's husband, John, and middle son, Joe (my age) came home.&nbsp; Then Joe and I went out to get dinner and then came back and watched <EM>Amityville Horror</EM>, which was QUITE frightening and creepy if you ask me.</P>
<P>SATURDAY: Just my mom and I went to Loyola's information session and tour.&nbsp; OH MY GOSH.&nbsp; Possibly the most beautiful campus I have ever seen in my life.&nbsp; All the buildings were gorgeous, and it was especially pretty because all the fall leaves had changed colors and so everything was orange and red.&nbsp; Way different than Texas's post-summer/pre-winter/not-quite-fall-exactly season.&nbsp; I loved the school, and the dorms were awesome - Princeton Review rated Loyola as #1 for on-campus housing, so that's always a plus.&nbsp; After visiting Loyola, my mom and I met Mary, John, and Pat at Joe's football game, after which we all went to mass, and then out to eat.&nbsp; Ironically, we ate at Lonestar Steak House, which promoted every Texas stereotype known to man.&nbsp; Pat asked if I had electrical power in Texas.&nbsp; I told him that only some did, the rest of us used kerosene.&nbsp; Duh.</P>
<P>SUNDAY: Mary, my mom, and I woke up early to board a plane and headed to Boston.&nbsp; Mary's oldest son, Tim, is a freshman at Boston College, so he walked us around campus, which was quite nice, but I'm just not going to let myself be tempted by BC because they only give merit-based scholarships to their top 15 freshman applicants.&nbsp; FIFTEEN.&nbsp; Anyway, after that, we went shopping in downtown Boston, which was SO AMAZING!!&nbsp; I'd never been to Boston but I love it I love it I love it, so even though I probably won't go to college there, I can at least visit every once in awhile hopefully.&nbsp; AHHHH it was awesome.&nbsp; I just can't even describe it.&nbsp; Oh, and we went out to dinner and I had lobster straight from the shell for the first time.&nbsp; Pretty adventuresome if you ask me.</P>
<P>MONDAY: The three of us went back to BC to go to an information session, which was really good, and then drove down to Providence.&nbsp; Providence College . . . how can I express how much I loved it.&nbsp; It just seemed to fit me so well, and all the students talking in the information session and giving the tour really seemed to love it too, which is always comforting.&nbsp; Gah.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; So that one and Loyola are my favorites.&nbsp; After that we went shopping and out to eat downtown.&nbsp; The city of Providence itself is sooo cute and picturesque.&nbsp; </P>
<P>And then today I flew back!</P>
<P>So basically, I LOVE THE EAST COAST!&nbsp; The weather was gorgeous (even though it was cold), the schools were great, and overall it was just a great experience. </P>
<P>So now I just wait I guess . . .&nbsp; :-/</P>

I turned 18!  My birthday was quite fun.  Nathan even came back in town.  What a sport.  

So I've been getting into a lot of theology reading lately in preparation for college.  Last week I read <i>Theology for Beginners</i> by F.J. Sheed, and this week I am reading <i>Mere Christianity</i> by C.S. Lewis.  They are both soooo good, and make me so excited to be going into theology.  The more I read about God, the more I realize how small I am and how much I'll never know, and the more amazed I am at Him and I just love Him so much more.  Or maybe I loved Him the same all along, and I'm just kind of discovering all of it now.  I think sometimes I just take for granted the fact that God is all-knowing and all-powerful, but when you sit back and think about it, that is astounding, that there exists a being who is so infinite in every aspect, and yet He loves us and protects us so much.  Every second, God is actively willing our existence, because if He wasn't, we simply wouldn't be here.

WEIRD.


So you are here because God wants you to be here!!!  Have a wonderful day!"

Thank heavens!!!  The only downside is I feel like my purpose of being at school is completely negated.  I will say, however, that this week was the first time I got sentimental about it being senior year and leaving and everything.  Because it's our last homecoming, that's kind of big.  TOO BAD WE LOST OUR GAME.  Eh I actually could care less.  It was still fun.  After the game a bunch of people came over, including several graduates, so it was wooonderful to see everyone again.  

Today was awesome.  Nathan and I ran a bunch of errands (my first trip to Fry's . . . that store is amazing.  There's a live piano player!  Good gosh), went to lunch, and then picked up Sara and went to Mozart's, which was lovely since the weather has been so nice.  After that I went home and chilled for awhile, then went downtown to eat with Ashley, Brynn, Mel, Kara, and Nathan.  We also tried to find the old Real World house but failed.  However we did pass by a gay bar . . . interesting.  All night was great but it made me miss them soooo much, we were laughing so hard the whole time.  alskdjf sometimes I just wish things could go back to the way they were.


I hope everyone had a WONDERFUL homecoming, whether at the dance or elsewhere!  <333"

People change a lot, and it sucks because sometimes I feel like I should be keeping them from changing.  I don't mean that to sound judgemental, but for some reason I take everyone as my responsibility, and I feel like any wrong path they go down is a result of my lack of effort.

Wasn't this weekend lovely.  On Friday night, Kara, Sara, Bolles, Steph, and I all dressed up and went out to Chili's for some high-class eating.  Discovery: lettuce wraps are so freakin good.  It's probably going to be a monthly tradition now, it was quite a nice time.  Afterwards, I went home and Meg had two of her friends over, so I took the three of them out to Mozart's and had them make me their mentor. Aww, freshmen.  Just kidding, they are three years younger and already much, much cooler than I am.  Excellent.

Saturdaaaaay Kyle (in town for the weekend!) and I saw ""Lord of War.""  Most depressing movie . . . EVER.  I'm definitely doing some kind of missionary work or something in Africa at some point in my life.  I came out of the movie digusted with humanity.  I don't know if I agree with the politics of the whole movie, but the basic idea that  Africa is a hell-hole and nothing is really helping . . . gah.  Something must be done.

Anyway, that night was Austin and Dustin's party . . . everyone looked hilarious, and it brought back the elementary days of skate parties.  Ashley, Mel, and I left early to go to Mozart's (twice in one weekend . . . impressive) and talk for awhile.  It was awesome to catch up with them.

Babysat Sunday, wahoo.

OH I also finished all my college essays this weekend!  YESSSS . . . admissions process - 0, Claire - 2345332.  Or somewhere thereabouts.

In case you were too lazy to make it out to Killeen to see it, here's the story: we were losing to Shoemaker, 19 - 0 at halftime.  And then in an AMAZING turnaround, we ended up winning 28 - 27, the last touchdown being scored with 57 seconds left to go.  That's what's so great about our boys, they don't give up!  They just keep on fighting because losing is not something Mavs do, apparently.

The only downer was there was a unbelievably wasted girl behind us who kept throwing up on the floor.  Gross.

I am so incredibly BLESSED.  Tuesday is becoming my favorite day of the week because I have FCA in the morning and En Croix at night, and those are both just AMAZING times to fellowship and learn from my peers.  I am just so amazed at how in just the few weeks that school has been in, God has just been giving and giving and giving to me.  I feel like I have so many new friendships forming this year and the ones that I've had for awhile are growing stronger, and it's all because God is just continually answering my prayers, and then some.  I just hope I remember this whenever things get hard this year.

Anyway I hope everyone is having a GREAT week and if you are feeling stressed, as we probably all are, just don't worry, it's only high school and everything works out for the best!!  I <3 U, eljay world!!!"

First of all, the Mavs KILLED Midway on Friday night.  It was an awesome game, and that's only a mere taste of what's to come, I'm sure!  And our performance was not to shabby, I might say.  So that was an excellent prelude to the fabulous weekend to come:

Saturday my mom drove me up to meet Ashley half-way between Austin and College Station, we had lunch, and then Ashley and I drove up to CS to hang out with her friends Ellen and Chelsea.  After a bit of that, I hung out with NATHAN at his dorm for awhile.  Oh how I'd missed my little BFF.  We parted ways when he went to a football party with his fish camp group, and I went with Ashley to her friends' parties, then the three of us met up again and hung out at Ashley's dorm.  Sunday, I went to mass with Nathan and his friend Katie, out to breakfast with Ash, and then my parents picked me up to go to Houston to see my family, including my favorite cousins who I never see.  We spent the night there and I just now got back in town.

This weekend made me want to go to college so much!  I felt all independent when I was walking from Ashley's dorm to church.  I can do things on my own, amazing.  But seriously, it was sooooo wonderful to see 38401932 people who I love this weekend.  Ohhhh life.

Well, now to embark on another week of business.  Cheerio laddies."

Well, the past few days have been grand.  I actually . . . love . . . school.

Weird, I know.

But think about it.  Three of my classes are Majestic-related, and then the other three are all subjects that are really interesting to me.  I <33333 English, especially now since I have a teacher who actually wants us to think, unlike Olmann.  Art history is really cool . . . Dr. Osbourne can be frustrating, but I really love the subject.  The shocker is government . . . I thought it would be incredibly boring, but I actually am really interested in it.  It's one of the few classes that actually pertains to real life.

Looks like I'm back to supernerding it this year.  It's going to take some getting used to, mainly because I loathed school so much last year.  But things change.

The past few days have been fun, too.  On Thursday I went to Luby's with Stef!!  Soooo good, plus it's always good to see her!  Then we came back to her house to look at homecoming dresses online.  My problem is, for some reason I made up a dress in my head that is way too specific and detailed, and most likely doesn't exist, and now I will only be disappointed with whatever I find.  Oh well.

Yesterday, Kara, Bizz, and I went to Jamba Juice after school, went our separate ways to all go home and take naps, and then met up again to see ""Wedding Crashers.""  Still so funny after three times.

Today is going to be kind of busy, but pretty fun.  I'm about to go shopping with the socials for Mother-Daughter Tea decor.  Everyone have a great weekend!"

"event","The first week of school was pretty good.  I never went over my B-day schedule, so I shall now do that:

5th - Majestics - this week in Maji has been so fun; I've missed getting ready for school after practice with everyone in front of the big dance room mirrors, borrowing makeup and straighteners and getting opinions on clothes.  What am I gonna do when I go to college and I have to figure out what I'm gonna wear all by myself??

6th - AP English - I HAVE KUNISH AGAIN!!!! YESSSS hellooooo easiest class ever, my name is Claire, I will be taking enormous advantage of you this year.  Plus, J.Strass sits next to me, so I expect we will be partnering up on any and every group assignment.  Of which there will be many.  Brittney is in my class again too, so we have had English together all 4 years I believe!  That must be a record or something.

7th - AP Art History - the subject will be really interesting, but it Dr. Osbourne doesn't stop saying ""uummmmmm"" between every word I'm going to have to throw it down in fisticuffs.  Hopefully it'll be an easy class, though.

8th - off to work!  Which has been so much fun.  I can't believe I'm getting paid for this.  Most of the kids are supersweet, which makes it much more enjoyable.

I don't work Fridays, so yesterday I went over to Austin's hizzouse with Nathan, Jordan, Menke, Stephen, and Scotty.  We just hung out, played a little frisbee.  It was quite enjoyable.  Later that night A.Gregg and I hung out, just went to Marble Slab and chatted about life, you know.  It was quite nice.  She's going back to College Station tomorrow . . . booo.   Oh, and Scotty left this morning.  I can't believe people are actually leaving now.  I got him a pretty cool card though: on the front it had two cats looking at a bottle of catsup, and one of the cats was saying, ""Tomatoes, corn syrup, vinegar, salt . . . see, there's no cats in catsup,"" and then on the inside it says ""There's no good in goodbye either!  You'll be missed.""  I thought that was pretty clever.  The good thing is I'm going up to A&M on the 3rd for Nathan's birthday, so hopefully I'll see everyone.

"event","First day was overall pretty good.  I basically only have one class on A days, because philosophy didn't fill up (who saw THAT coming?) so I got put in Dance IV for a semester, which is also the line officer period, so Mrs. Cochran said I could just hang out and plan stuff with them.  Chyeessss!  So here is my A - Day:

1st - Majestics - not very many cool people in there.  Haha just kidding, there's 67 awesome gals in that class!  We talked about the New York trip today, and I'm SO EXCITED!  Plus, we for sure are going at the same time as the AHS Belles, so I'll see Amanda!  

2nd - Officer Period - mmmm I just chatted with the Line Os the whole time.  I think I'll like this.

3rd - AP Government - I don't really know a lot of people in this class, but it should be fine anyway.  Doesn't seem too difficult, especially in comparison to Dr. Conn's course of doom last year.

4th - off . . . I just go home to change and find something to eat before I run off to work . . . today was the first day.  Ohhhhkay, it was fun, but WAY more tiring than I had expected it to be, and the kids were not all exactly cooperative.  But I think overall it's going to be a fun place to work, I'll just be freaking exhausted every day.

I'm proud of myself for today, though.  Right after work I came home and wrote my Government essay, and I didn't have to read the chapter because I already did that when I got my textbooks last week!  TRIUMPH!!!!  

Tomorrow = Majestics, AP English, AP Art History, then off to work again.  Updates to come, keep your freakin pants on. ;)"

Yesterday I went to go help at my brother and sister-in-law's garage sale.  I pretty much just stood around and talked to them.  It was fun.  Then later Nathan and I went to Best Buy and then to an Express game with Austin, Billy, and Carly.  Austin's little sister was singing at the game, and she was AWESOME!  I felt so cool for knowing her!  Ohhhh Casey, my favorite 9-year old.  Anyway, after that we went to Lindsay's, bc she was having a get together since Bill Warrander was in town.  It was cool stuff.  Then todaaaaaay was the perfect mixture of productivity and fun . . . went to church, went to Mr. Gattis with Erica, Katie, Lin, Stef, and Julie, learned the pom with Kara, made my squad locker decorations, went to dinner at my brother's house, wrote my English essay, then hung out with Lindy, Stef, Katie, Amanda, and Julie at Lindy and Stef's house.  We just, you know, talked about life and stalked people on Myspace.  Ohhhhh '31 girls, how I love you.


Oh my GOSH I do not want the grads to leave.  Melanie left yesterday and I pretty much wanted to die.  I don't know what I'm going to do when everyone else leaves.  It's all coming up so soon, like next week.  I know senior year is going to be fun, but it's hard to imagine it without my '05 friends.  Uggghhh I hate change.

Her mom even made us ""school sandwiches"" for dinner with smiley faces made out of Skittles and Starbursts on top. Ohhhh Mrs. Higdon.  Anyway, we just had a nice time talking about life in general and how things change and it sucks, and then we went over to Julie's with Lindy and Stef!   And their friends Will and Chris, who I didn't really know, but seemed nice.  After some fun times there I went to Ashley's where Nathan, Kyle, Stephen, and Mel were hanging out, which was fun but I was only there for about an hour.

Yesterday . . . ohhhh yesterday.  I hate senior round-up SO MUCH.  I don't even know why.  It's not really that bad, I just hate being shuffled around.  And I refuse, I REFUSE to wear my ID around my NECK this year.  That is the most ridiculous rule I have ever heard IN MY LIFE.  I didn't even get mine hole-punched, because that is the first step toward conformity!  Come on, if no one does it, what can the teachers do?  There are more of us than there are of them!  WHO'S WITH ME?!?!  

Oh, P.S., I got a horrible horrible parking spot for my senior year.  Oooohhhhkay.

Anyway, yesterday wasn't only senior round-up, it was also the faculty breakfast (served by Majestics) and then team pictures.  So my day was pretty much running all over the school trying to get everything done.  And since I had pulled an all nighter the night before (literally . . . I didn't even close my eyes once), I came home and slept for 6 hours, woke up for Laguna Beach, and then went back to sleep til this morning.  The good news is, our car wash got postponed until Thursday, so we just had practice and I'm home way early.  Hence I will now get more sleep.

I don't care if that's geeky or nerdy or whatever, I hate the week before school, it's like being in limbo.  Summer is pretty much over, but not quite, so it seems like it's not worth it to try and do anything fun, because time is slipping away so quickly anyway.  And I end up doing nothing all week.

BUT NOT THIS YEAR!  I am going to jam-pack my last few days of summer with so much fun that people will mistake me for a professional fun-haver.  They exist, you know.

Majestics is back . . . Austin Dance Camp was Thursday and Friday, and it was so freaking exhausting, but also a lot of fun.  We're performing the hip hop we learned for Colt Camp this Tuesday.  We're all white.  Get excited.

I've decided at the last minute that I will actually read The Poisonwood Bible.  The reason I wasn't going to at first was because I already read it a few years ago, but I don't really remember anything, and I don't want to take any chances on my first essay of senior year.  My plan is, I'll start reading it today, and if I'm not finished by Tuesday night, then I'll just go off the Sparknotes and what I've read so far.

Oddly enough, Austin and Candace were at the same theater and we all sat together.  Then we found out that they had unknowingly parked next to us . . . WEIRD.  It was quite fun though.  Then yesterday, I went shopping with the one and only ERICA on the drag!  I got some reeeal cute pants and of course the quality time with my little babygirl was priceless.  Majestics started up today with Mrs Kosh's surprise birthday party and then practice.  It was pretty fun, kind of sad to know that my summer is essentially over, but I guess I was pretty ready for it anyway.  

Story of the day . . . after practice, we were having a Maji pool party, but before that Laura and I stopped at Quizno's.  As we were leaving, she stepped off a curb, not knowing there was a gutter under her, and sprained her ankle on the slant.  As she fell, her keys fell into the gutter.  My keys were unfortunately at home, but luckily, Maria, Allison, and Kaitlyn were there, so Kaitlyn took me to my house so I could get my keys, and Allison and Maria took Laura to Allison's house to ice her ankle, and then I got the car, picked Laura up, and took her home.  So no pool party for us, but interesting tale to tell.

This afternoon was quite hard though, because I said goodbye to Jill, my youth minister.  I started crying before I even saw her.  I just can't believe that one of the best role models and most trusted advisors I have ever had is leaving.  I know we'll stay in touch, but it's just going to be hard not seeing her every week.  I'm kind of worried about next year's youth group, but I'm gonna stick it out because I think it'll be worth it in the long run.  I just wish she didn't have to go.

Friday night, Nathan and I went to visit Laura working at Johnny Carino's, and it was fun to see my little sister is hostessing action!  Plus, the food was freaking good . . . I got the Italian nachos, and I must say, they were exceptional.  After that, Nathan and I headed back to my house for a ""Family Guy""/""Futurama"" marathon, and when Laura got of work, the three of us went to IHOP for more eating . . . that's pretty much what we do in the summer.  Has anyone ever noticed that everyone who works at IHOP is off their rocker?  One time I went there and ordered a brownie sundae, and they forgot to put the brownie in it . . . I think I've written about that before.  And then there's the one mumbling waiter . . . I remember one time I went with Katie and he brought the manager out to convince her that their eggs were sanitary.  She just doesn't like restaurant eggs.  Sheesh.  

Saturday was glorious . . . I did some serious shopping during the day, and then later, Nathan and I went to visit Erica working at Sonic (maybe I do stuff like this because I wish I had a job).  Anywho, I love seeing Erica, she brings me joy. :)  After that, we went to Mel's house.  Oh yeah, by the way, Melanie Smith is a Kilgore Rangerette now!  I'm so proud of her, I knew she'd make it!  So it was awesome to see her after her long audition week, and also, BRYNN WAS THERE!!!!!  I hadn't seen her in SO LONG since she's been living her new life in Florida.  It was the most jubilant meeting I've experienced in awhile . . . I miss her soooo much, but I know we will continue keeping in touch.  It just made my night/life to see her.

Today was also grand . . . didn't really do much until church, where I saw John after forever, which was lovely.  And later on, Katie, Nathan, Stephen, Scotty, and I went to Chuy's.  Katie had to leave after that because she has volleyball tomorrow and the rest of the week (good luck babygirl!), but the rest of us went back to my house, joined by Austin, and played Apples to Apples . . . seriously, the best game ever invented.

Everyone who calls themselves a feminist, but is ""pro-choice"" contradicts themselves.  People are under the sad misconception that abortion is God's gift to women, and that without it, we have no control over our bodies and futures.  It is, of course, quite the opposite.  Abortion in no way helps women.  In fact, it completely lets the man off the hook!  Sure, the woman doesn't have to deal with raising a child, but she more often than not will have to struggle with PAS - Post Abortion Syndrome.  Raising a child, while strenuous and tasking, gives far greater rewards than the psychological trauma that comes with killing your own baby.  

Another point: think about the women who recieve abortions.  These are not strong, assertive women marching into a clinic to demand their rights.  These are usually scared and confused young girls who are being told by their boyfriend, their boyfriend's parents, their own parents, their friends, or other outside influences that abortion is the easiest route to take, a simple quick-fix for unfortunate occurances.  But isn't responsibility part of the true essence of feminism?  What sort of direction are we moving in if we are only seeking ways to erase our mistakes rather than turn them into something better?  

One argument that people often have for abortion is the case of special-needs babies.  If a mental disorder or physical deformity is detected in an unborn baby, they reason, why not just spare it the harshness of an unfulfilling life?  I have never heard so wretched an assertion in all my life.  Who is anyone to say that a person leads a less fulfilling life because of some challenges they face?  I have known many people with Downs Syndrome and other mental and physical illnesses, and I can safely say that they have led far from meaningless lives.  It is not our place as humans to judge how fulfilling another human's life is.

The other main argument for abortion - rape.  This is somewhat tougher, because the pregnancy is incurred on the girl through no fault of her own.  However, it is not through the fault of her child either, and he/she does not deserve to die.  Some say, why make the victim suffer through more physical trauma in childbirth, but it is widely known that abortion procedures are EXTREMELY dangerous to the reproductive organs of women.  This argument, therefore, has no ground.

People seem to have forgotten about the option of adoption.  Yes, it would be extremely hard to give your child away, but how much harder must it be to end his/her very life?  It seems to me that people listen far too much to Planned Parenthood and, in the process, have rendered their consciences inaudible.  There's only one thing I can think of to say to those people . . . wake up."

"event","The past few days have been fun, nothing important to share in detail.  Except that ""Wedding Crashers"" is EXCELLENT.  Saw it with Kara, Sara, and Nathan on Saturday.  It was hilarious.


Maaannnn I think too much during the summer.  And then I freak myself out with 
a) thoughts about college
b) thoughts about a future career
c) thoughts about my friendships and my stupid insecurities in them
d) thoughts about myself and how much of a better person I could be.  

I love summer, but sometimes it is just too hard on me emotionally.


I think I just need some sleep right now."

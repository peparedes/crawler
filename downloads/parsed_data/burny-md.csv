"event","Its been forever since I posted on here.  I'm actually kinda afraid to go back and look exactly how long. ;)  I've mostly been spending my time on facebook.  There is something nice about being able to click a link letting your friends know you care, or posting just a few words to let everyone know what's going on.  Posting 1 liners on lj just doesn't work. ;)

Anyway, we've had a... different kind of week this past week.  There is enough going on that I figured I should put something here.

First, the good.  For those that haven't heard through other means, either Facebook or the grape vine, Sharon is pregnant.  I'm gonna be a daddy. (Big Daddy as some have coined it) ;)  Due date is March 21st, at least as of now.  We have yet to have the first sonogram, so as things progress, we'll get a better idea.  We don't know the sex yet, but we do intend to find out.  We're both excited, but I'm sure Sharon will be more excited when she stops being sick. ;)

<lj-cut text=""The Bad, behind the cut for those that don't want to read"">
The Bad...

Today is a very sad day for us.  Bonnie has been sick for the last few weeks, and has stopped eating.  We've taken her to the vet a number of times, and they've done a number of tests.  Everything came back fine, so the best guess is that its something in her head.  We've done everything we can to try to get her to eat, but she just won't.  She lost a lot of weight, almost a third of her weight.  Its been very sad for us to watch this happen to her, and unable to do anything.  We talked about it, talked to others, and finally decided that she had lived a wonderful 14 years, and there was nothing else we could do for her.  We talked with Rob, and he wanted to come be with her in the end.  He flew in yesterday, and this morning, we all went to the vet.  We said our goodbyes, and let her go.  As much as we all know it was the best thing for her, it was extremely hard to do.  The house is a bit more lonely now.  Luckily we still have one of our cats, who's had to deal with our constant cuddling.  She does her best. ;)
</lj-cut>

So, all in all, we're doing good.  Just having a tough time today, but otherwise things are going well.

Also, for those that have wondered and asked, we are still having OTT this year.  Same general plans as usual.  OTT v7.0 is on, so make your plans. :)  Only difference we'll have this year, is 2 turkeys... one on the table and one in the oven. ;)"

Opening weekend of the Arizona Renaissance Faire is February 6th-7th, approximately one month from now!!

What: A gathering of folks in the desert (no not that party).

When: Weekend of Feb 6th-7th 2009. Fly in when you like, preferably Friday the 5th and leave when you have to go.

Where: Tim and Sharon's AZ house.

Who: Open to anyone who likes fest, food, fun, leather, food, friends, funky stuff, leather, watching me try on leather, trying on leather, dressing up, undressing, dressing down, beer, wine, food... you know the rest.

We have plenty of crash space and I am planning another fabulous meal to rival that of Thanksgiving! Current plan is Fest on Saturday and then possibly Football on Sunday. It is Superbowl weekend and I may or may not be interested in it, depending on who is playing. ;)

Hope we see you all soon, especially those we missed at OTT!! ;)"

"event","Well, it really starts in the end of November.  On Monday, I'm heading out to San Jose for about 2 weeks for work.  I'll be out there from 11/30 till 12/11, getting some good hands on, as well as relationship building with some guys from Hong Kong.

Anyone else gonna be out there at that time? :)  Also accepting recommendations for food/activities.  We're basically just outside of SJC.  So anything in that area.


So, then I fly back from San Jose on the 11th, same day as Sharon's mother comes in for the weekend.  Then we have some activities planned for that weekend.  I work from home for the next week, and then we fly to Philly the following weekend.  I'll be working from Philly for Monday and Tuesday, then actually take off Wednesday.  We'll do all of our family things there, and also 2 football games. :)

Off to pack and prepare to drop the last of our guests, <lj user=""l_stboy""> at the airport in a couple hours.  Then is time to spend some quality time with the wifey... If current activities are any indication, we may be playing Rock Band. ;)"

Well, what that means is that we're finalizing things for OTT. (read, gotta order the turkey)  Sharon always orders a fresh farm on, instead of those store bought butterball ones. ;)

So, if you haven't let me know, please do.  And if you're still considering it, please also let me know.

As a related note, we're planning a Fest outing for the first weekend of AZ fest.  If you're on Facebook, I've created an invite.  If you're on there, and didn't get the invite, don't be offended, its just cause I didn't think you'd come.  If you are on there, and want to come, and don't have the invite, just let me know. :)  If you're not on Facebook (geez, who doesn't have a facebook account these days?!?! ;), just let me know here, email, whatever. :)  Its Feb 6th."

"event","I can't believe the end of Oct is coming up so fast!  This month has just flown by, with traveling, the new job, and just life. :)

So, what that means is that OTT v6.0 is just a little over a month away.  I was told today by <lj user=""l_stboy""> that flight prices have just come down some into ""good for holiday"" ranges.  So, if you haven't gotten your tickets, now's a good a time as any. :)

Flying in Wed evening/night, and leaving Sunday sometime tend to be ""averages"".  Your milage may vary. ;)

Sharon is getting ready in her usual way.  We've tested some deserts out on the neighbors, they're still living... they've even asked her to make some more deserts for a bbq we're headed to at their house this weekend. ;)  There is also a tentative menu stuck up on the fridge, with a few blanks, and a few choices left to make.  I've heard rumors of a fun little soup shot thingy like we had at Canlis as an amuse thingy... (that thingy you have before the meal to wake up your pallet. ;)

Once you get your flight info, please forward it on, so we can make pick up plans, and make sure you are acquired at the airport. :)  If you're driving in, just let me know when you're planning to be here, and just stay in touch so you know where to go when you arrive.

For those that haven't noticed, or didn't get one, I sent out a Google Calendar invite.  If you didn't get one, it was either because you don't have a gmail account that I'm aware of, I didn't even think you were a remote possibility of attending, or I'm an idiot and just missed it. (I had to go back 4-5 times to add everyone I did. ;)

If you're thinking about attending, definitely not coming, or definitely are just haven't gotten flights yet, just let me know so we plan accordingly. :)"

"event","So, I've been working on this for a while. (Really, I've been working on it for over a year...)  Things finally came together, and just this morning I accepted a job with IBM.  ""But you already work for IBM"" you say.  Well, you're right, except that right now, I'm a contractor, to a company, who contracts me to a company, who contracts me to IBM.  As of September 10th, I will be getting my paycheck from Big Blue themselves.  This means a lot of things.  With the economy, and the business model of IBM recently, it first means money gets better.  More important than that, it gives me a lot more job security.  I also get great benefits, and a number of perks.  Along with those, I get to do something that I'm pretty sure I'll love.  This is still a work at home, with some minimal travel.  The great news about the travel is to one of 3 places; Washington DC, San Jose or Hong Kong. :)  The job is labeled as a Linux Engineer, which is basically SA, Engineer and Architect wrapped up in one.  Its sorta a small shop, which is uncommon in IBM, but its exactly what I want. :)  I'm going to a team that already has 4 other people I've worked with, and I know there is interest in bringing a 5th.  They are a great group, and both fun and smart.

So, as of 9/10, I'll really be IBM.  Then on the 21st, I'll be heading to NY (somewhere) for my new hire orientation.  Not sure on the details of that yet, but we may tie it into an already planned East Coast trip. :)

Needless to say, I'm REALLY excited about this!  I've been on edge waiting for the offer letter, even though I knew it was already solid. :)  Now that part is over, and now its time to get to work! :-D  There's going to be a transition period, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. ;)"

"event","So, its been AGES since I posted here.  I've been mostly spending my time over on facebook.  It seems to match my mood better, more micro-blogging.  I spend all of my time in emails, chats, putting together large presentations and documents, etc.  I don't really want to sit down and write more. :)

Anyway, I figured this warranted more. ;)

We headed over the big pond for a week to Germany.  We had a good excuse though, so it was okay. :)  A couple friends of ours were having a Bavarian Wedding on July 4th.  We arrived on Wednesday morning, about a day before most others.  So we got some time to recover and relax.  Unfortunately, Sharon had bad airplane food or something, so she was out of commission for a couple days.  I, however, had no problem and went about my business of enjoying Bad Tolz. :)  Thursday, we had a nice relaxing morning, then Maria, Martin and I headed into Munich.  We met up with Mathias, and eventually made our way to the airport.  There, we met the Bristol crew, and had some beers at the beer garden at the airport brewery. (Only in Germany!) :)  After a couple there, we headed off on the train to a real beer garden.  This is my first experience with one, although Sharon's been talking about them for ages! ;)  A few beers, a few pretzels, and some sausages later, we eventually make our drunken way back to the train to head home.

Friday was some wandering around Bad Tolz with the crew, then back to <a href=""http://www.gasthaus-toelz.de/"">Gasthaus</a>, where Martin is the brewer, for some lunch.  After lunch, Sharon and some other gals headed off to Munich for some visiting.  Sharon stayed with a friend the night, and baked some cakes.  I stayed with the rest of the group in Bad Tolz, at the bar in fact, and kept drinking. :)  It was really the only time it was raining in Bad Tolz while we were there, so it was a good time to stay under some umbrellas.  The British were drinking Gin and Tonics (how predictable! ;), and I stuck with the beer.  With the exception of a few shots.  We apparently spent enough money and time there that they gave us some free stuff. ;)  After that, it was a party at Martin's parent's house which was a lot of fun. :)

Saturday was the wedding.  I promised them that I'd control the weather, and keep the rain away.  I kept my promise. ;)  Its nice having the power to control the weather. :-D  The wedding was very cool!  Sharon actually managed to make it back in time... barely!  It was a cool church wedding, both Protestant and Catholic.  And both in German and English. :)  Then back to Maria's mother's place, which was the Inn that we had all been staying in.  It was a great time of enjoyment, chatting with people, being confused by German conversations, and meeting some new cool people! :)

Sunday was a nice relaxing morning, then saying good bye to all of the cool people we met.  Then a drive to somewhere else for a Medieval festival.  We were expecting something like the Renaissance festivals we're used to.  Instead it seemed to be just a huge jousting arena with a very large food court around it.  So, we decided to leave there, and walk around the city.  We walked up some mountain to a castle.  After we exaustingly walked all the way up, and then it immediately started to pour down!  So we made our way back to the car.  After dinner with BK's father, we eventually made it back to BK's brand new flat.  We got a few hours of sleep, before we had to get up early the next morning and make our way to the airport.

The flight from Munich to Atlanta wasn't so bad, just long of course.  It was the 5 and a half hour layover, that then turned into about a 7 hour layover cause of delays that killed us.  We calculated that we were traveling for about 26 hours to get home.  It was tough traveling that far, but I'd say it was all worth it. :)  We had an awesome time!"

I've noticed that Netflix has cheaper plans than Blockbuster, both have online streaming in different forms.  Blockbuster isn't super close to us, and Sharon is always complaining about ""having to go to Blockbuster.""

I think online rentals is the way of the future, so I want to make a move towards that.  From what I can tell, nothing is a true replacement to DVDs, but they're getting closer.  And the fact that most services don't offer new releases online yet, but I think that's where most of them are going to be moving in the ""near future.""

I'm leaning towards Netflix, and purchasing their Roku device.  I know Netflix is a good dvd by mail service, as I used to have them.

I'm curious if anyone has experience or advice on this or other services."

"event","Its been a while since I posted.  Not a whole lot has been going on.  Mostly quiet at home, we've had to cut back our traveling after exhausting ourselves. :-D  That seems to be extending into January, but February is starting to shape up to be a full month!

Work has been...well... work.  And I don't really feel like talking about that subject, so that's it. :)

<b>Car</b>
On thing that has been quite a new experience for me, since we got back from our honeymoon, is that I don't have a car.  Its not really that I NEED one, but its an odd feeling not having one.  We have to plan any car trips or grocery runs, etc; very carefully.  The only thing that's really allowed me to survive is that there are enough places to get basic stuff within walking or biking distance.  I can go to Walmart, Target, Post office, drug store, and even a few food places.  I can even go to the new library.  Its hard to get too much stuff when I go to any of those places, but I usually take a backpack, so whatever fits in there.

I keep considering what I want to do about this.  I'm not real keen on the idea of getting an expensive car and taking on another monthly expense of the car payment.  I've looked at something like an older Jeep, something I could work on.  Even considered getting a scooter just for running around short distances, but that's not really a smart move. :)  What I REALLY want, is a 2006 Mini Cooper type S convertible. :)  That, however, breaks the main thing I'm trying to avoid right now. :)  And I'm also enjoying having the extra cash I got from my accident to play in the stock market.  I've gotten some good gains out of it, I figured if I could, it was better than the money sitting in my savings account. ;)  I keep looking on craigslist every once in a while, and if I find a good project jeep for the right price, I'll probably get it. :)

<b>February, East Coast, Vegas</b>
February is going to be a busy month.  The first full weekend (the 7th and 8th) is the first weekend in <a href=""http://www.royalfaires.com/arizona/"">AZ Fest</a>, so it looks like we're going to that. :)  The next weekend, we're going back east to visit family.  Sharon's sister (the non-lj one) is spawning, twin boys no less, which apparently are being born today.  So we're flying back to Philly on the 13th, seeing her sister and new nephews on Saturday morning.  Then we're heading down to Salisbury to see my parents and take them out to dinner on their anniversary. (yes, they got married on v-day ;)  Sunday will be heading back up to Philly, and then probably over to Atlantic City to get some of Sharon's gambling out of her system. :)  Then flying back home on Monday.

The following weekend, we're driving to Vegas for a group adventure. (see why we had to get Sharon's gambling out of her system? ;)  <lj user=""l_stboy""> and his better half are flying out Friday.  <lj user=""callmetc""> and <lj user=""jpenamelist""> are flying out, and we'll pick them up at the airport on our way into town.  And <lj user=""ryv_m""> may be joining us as well, but has been keeping suspiciously quiet. :)  We'll be driving back Monday morning, so that will be a half day for me.  And based on the laws of Las Vegas, I'm not permitted to say anything else about that weekend. ;)

We still have one weekend after that in Feb, but I'm sure we'll find something local to do.  Either more Fest, or do some more hiking. (we've been trying to go a little more frequently :)  One really bad thing about our travel dates, that Sharon found out this week, is that the two weekend's we're out of the state, are the only two weekend <a href=""http://www.royalfaires.com/arizona/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=91:mediaevil-baebes&catid=10:thefestival"">Mediavel Baebes</a> are coming to AZ Fest! *sigh*

<b>March</b>
March is going to be another month with some activity.  Sharon's birthday is the 11th, so we'll do ""something"" for that.  She was talking of having her mother come out for a Fest visit... not sure if I can take more of her in fest garb!!! ;)  March 21st is <lj user=""menckles"">'s wedding, in New Orleans, so of COURSE we have to go to that. ;)

<b>AZ Fest</b>
Aside from the weekend's we're away, if anyone is interested in coming to AZ for a fest adventure, let me know. :)  It runs until the end of March.  As I'm sure you can expect, there would not only be fest, but also fabulous food, adventure, and of course perfect weather.  And if desperately needed, I'm sure we could manage to through ""fun"" in there somewhere. ;)


Right now, that's about all the planning I can take.  As of now, it doesn't look like we're doing OTP in Ireland, but that may change depending on another friend's wedding plans in Germany. :)  Also at some point, we're gonna try to get out to CA, do some wine stuff."

<lj-cut text=""Details..."">

We got our first three visitors Tuesday night, which resulted in some food at Applebees, and some relaxing at home, settling in.  Wednesday was more relaxation, renting of Guitar Hero: World Tour, and some more enjoying of company.  I worked some, but kept it light. ;)  Sharon, of course, did her cooking. :)

Thursday, T and J went to run a 10k (crazy people), and got back to the house about the time I headed to the airport to pick up C and J.  I'm just noticing that we had a couple ""and J""s. ;)

Dinner was excellent!  And the weather even cooperated with us, which was a concern.  It had rained a bit, but it rained a little earlier on Thursday, and much later, but it was perfect outside for our dinner. :)  I'll leave the menu posts to Sharon, which she's done <a href=""http://seerofkell.livejournal.com/40039.html"">here</a>. :)  She has to pull them out of her head. ;)  Afterwards, there was a move to inside where there was much relaxing, alcohol, guitar hero, and fun. :)

Friday was a slow day with much of the same.  There was finally some movement, and we made it to the <a href=""http://www.dbg.org/index.php/lumi"">Luminarias</a> at night, which was pretty cool.  Followed by more of the same. ;)  One thing to mention from the Luminarias, was a drink that we got.  Its hot apple cider and Jack.   Totally good stuff! :)  Afterwards, it was sushi at Sharon's favorite Korean/Sushi place. :)  We finished up the night with Wal-e, and the extras, including Burn-E!!!!!

Saturday, we TRIED to get out earlier, but about noonish, we finally got out for lunch, which was across the street.  Its so awesome to be able to walk to a bar, let alone anything at all! :)  The plan was to go there for lunch, then to the park for some walking, but we started late, lunch was long, and we were stuffed.  So we decided to chill a little bit, and we introduced everyone to Blue Harvest.  If you don't know what that is, google it. ;)  Then it was off to the airport to send C and J on their way home.  Dinner was some grilled food, sorry you missed it Christine. ;(  We watched the original Star Wars, and kept throwing in comments from Blue Harvest!  hehehe  And Todd kept trying to start a drinking game with the force... we were just drinking randomly I think. ;)  Finalizing the night with a game of Sorry, then Clue. :)

Sunday, we actually got out a little earlier, and checked out a new (for us) park just south of us.  They let Jenn and I pick the route... muhahaha  It was a short 4ish mile walk with mild elevation change.  It was a good walk, it was great outside, and we definitely worked up an appetite!  So we picked up Quiznos on the way home. :)  After lunch, it was time to say goodbye to T and J, and send them on their way.  They seemed to have found their way back to their airport.  Afterwards, it was time to collapse with Marda being the last. :)  So we watched some more TV, and put together Legos. :-D

Marda got up way too early this morning to ride in with Sharon.  But regardless of that, she made it home safely. :)

I'm sure everyone is looking forward to another year of all of this, I know I am! :)  It really is awesome that our friends come out for this holiday.  Hopefully next year, those who made excuses this year, will see the error of their mistakes! :-P

And a totally random Monday link for your amusement. ;)

"event","I've been really bad about posting, and I have a zillion things to post about. *sigh*  So I'll try to get some basic updates here.

Wedding was excellent, the weather I ordered on e-bay came through! ;)  We have a TON of pictures (I'm not kidding), and lots of video (currently being converted to something I can share).  I'll post eventually when I have them in sharing capabilities. :)  And just for the record, yes, we went through with it, we're hitched. :)

Honeymoon, it was an adventure, a very long one.  It was great though, and definitely an experience!  We have a ton of picture and video from that too.  Here are just a few of the pictures (100) Sharon got up:
http://www.geekmeat.net/gallery2/main.php/v/Trips/Africa/

Returning was yet another adventure, one that I want to post about, but it really deserves its own post and time dedicated to it.  We're all back in one piece, home safe. :)

Work has been rough for the past few weeks since we've been back.  As soon as I got back, I got dumped a couple problems that hadn't been resolved while I was away.  I'm slowly getting through them.  Work is also another subject worth a whole post of its own. :)  Probably a friend's only post. ;)

I've settled everything with my old car.  It was totaled, and I got paid for it.  Definitely not what I want, but its done, settled, and time to move on.  I got a rental for a week to take care of some things, and also drive around looking for a new car.  Now my current mode of transportation is bicycle.  Luckily they've finally built things around us, so I can get just about anything I really need by bike. As for a replacement, I think I'm going to get an 06 Mini Cooper S convertible. :)  Not a common car, so still looking for something else, or exactly what I want.

Final major thing I wanted to cover, OTT. :)  Just a few weeks away.  I made a note about it before I left, and no one responded.  I've tracked down a few people that normally come and gotten answers.  It looks like its going to be a smaller gathering this year than years past.  The total for dinner is going to be 7, less than the 11 last year. ;)  But it should be a fun time none the less.  And we're going to the Luminarias at the Botanical Gardens.

If someone's reading this, and doesn't have anything to do for Thanksgiving (and wants something to do), we will make room for you, just let me know. :)"

I know a number of people have already told me yes, or assumptions have been made, and that is all good. :)  If you are coming, please let me know, and also let me know when you have flight stuff.

Same as always, good food, good wine, good people.  There is more stuff around us now, so we could actually walk to BevMo now if we wanted... although it would be easier to bring all the booze back in a car. ;)

Times are the same as always... Dinner will be Thursday afternoon, so please arrive Thursday about noonish at the latest.  Preferable arrival times are Wed afternoon/evening/night.  Suggested departure times are Sunday afternoon.  That being said, we'll take you when we can get you.

Sharon would have normally had the full menu planned by now, but this will be an abridged planning.  Which is actually probably good, cause she won't have time to change it 5 times. ;)  And I'm sure the food will be fabulous as always. ;)"

Its down to the final stages, getting the last bits ready, crossing the t's, dotting the i's.  And not a moment to soon, before we end up killing each other over this. ;)

We just got our rings, the favors, and a few last minute things for the honeymoon trip in Africa.  We're weighing things for that trip, trying to figure out how to get it all to PA, and what to do with it afterwards.    Finalizing the seating chart, the food orders, table layouts, etc.

Tomorrow is probably when we pack up everything for the honeymoon (most of it atleast), and figure out what else has to go just to Philly.  Then Wed we get rid of the animals to the kennels, and do last minute packing.  Then Thursday, we figure out how to get our final bits of work done, and get to the airport. :)  Sharon's boss is going to drop us off, and we're leaving our car at his place.

We'll be in Philly around midnight Thursday night.  Friday is Sharon's hair, maybe golf for me if things work out, Fairecon, get tuxes, ask myself ""am I really doing this?!?!"", and probably some dinner.  Sharon's also thinking Casino, but we'll see.  Saturday is kinda up in the air.  Mostly I think its going to be a relaxation day, get things towards the hotel and the location.  Then rehearsal dinner at night.  Then Sharon and I get to do our final pre-marital...umm... things. :-D

Then, Sunday is the big day!

Monday, we re-pack, move things to Sharon's parents, etc.  Then hop on a plane for a very long time.  To London, then to Kenya.  Two weeks away, some relaxation, some pictures, a lot of great experiences.  Then back to the real world, eventually. :)"

"event","So, this is kinda last minute posting, but its been planned for a while.  Sharon made a post about this as well.

This Friday, we're flying out to Philly, arriving late.  Saturday morning, we're heading out to West Chester for a 9am hair appointment for Sharon.  This is sorta her pre-wedding appointment.  She said it will take 2-3 hours, so I'll either see if I can get a manicure while I wait, or just go drive around the area to check some places out in the area.

After that, we're heading down to MD Fest... probably get there around 12-1ish.  Anyone that wants to join us is welcome to. :)  After fest, I think Sharon has dinner plans (or atleast ambitions :) at Helen's Garden. (I'm sure Brandie will be excited about that one ;)

We'll be spending the night at <lj user=""youvebeenpixied"">'s house Saturday night, and Sunday drive back up to Philly.  I'm not exactly sure about Sharon's plans for Sunday morning, but I'm sure she has some.  I remember something about ""If you can get up early enough Sunday"", but I don't remember the rest. :)

Sunday afternoon, we're going to the Eagles game.  We usually get back east for atleast a couple games, but this year, this will be our only one.  So, we have to make the most of it. :)  After the game, we may be going out to  Atlantic City for Sharon to get her gambling fix.  I really do think she has a problem. ;)

Monday is the important day, and the primary reason for this trip.  Sharon would argue that the Eagles game was the primary reason, but... :)  We're heading into West Chester again, this time to the Courthouse.  We need to both be there to apply for our marriage license.  So, we'll get our legal ability to get married. :)  Afterwards, if there is time, we'll probably stop by the linen store, to check out the table cloths, napkins, etc.  We got tiny little samples to look at when we went to the catterer, but its hard to tell. :)

Then, Monday afternoon, we hop back on a plane for home. :)  Then, we'll get off the plane, and meet up with <lj user=""callmetc""> for a late dinner, as he's in town for a couple days. :)  It will be a little weird to see him in MD, then see him in PHX a couple days later. ;)"

I've had a few things I meant to post about, but just not the motivation to do it.  Not to mention work's been so busy and a little stressful, that I really don't want to get done work only to start typing more. :)

3 Weekends ago, I went up flying with some friends.  Its a single engine small plane, so they were flying, I just got to go for a ride really. :)  But I took up Sharon's camera, and got some good <a href=""http://www.geekmeat.net/gallery2/v/Arizona/Flying/20080809/"">arial shots of Queen Creek</a>.

<lj-cut text=""Best shot of our community"">
<img src=""http://www.geekmeat.net/gallery2/d/27666-2/DSC_2235.JPG"" />
</lj-cut>

The weekend after that, Sharon headed home for the weekend to do family stuff, and a couple wedding things.  I stayed home cause we're saving our traveling money for later in the year. ;)  Found out that Queen Creek isn't quite setup for riding a bike around yet.  It should get there, but there's still a lot of construction going on.  I also finally got around to playing God of War 2.  Got stuck on one spot, so have to work on that. :)  Need to have it finished by OTT. :)

This weekend, I got an email on Friday from Schnepf Farm's owner mentioning a grand opening that night.  So Sharon and I went down to check it out.  Got some wine, and a free massage.  It was a relatively nice place, but it needs some more experience.  They just didn't seem ready to be open, and I'm sure it will be a bit nicer once it cools down a little.

Yesterday, we went to the Camera store to pick up a lens Sharon had rented.  Its a 400mm fixed focal lens.  The lens is <a href=""http://www.geekmeat.net/gallery2/v/Arizona/World+Wildlife+Zoo/sharon+400mm+1.jpg.html"">huge</a>! :)  I weighed it, and its 12 lbs.  We took it out to the west side of the city to check out a zoo called <a href=""http://www.wildlifeworld.com/"">Wild Life World Zoo</a>.  She took a lot of pictures, with some really close up shots. ;)  Its amazing how close they all appear, and we weren't that close.  We were testing it out cause we're planning to try to take it to Africa for the honeymoon.  Yeah, she's not going on a honeymoon to be with me, she's doing it for the pictures. ;)  It was hot, but it was fun.  A new adventure.


Aside from all of that stuff, everything else is good.  Wedding planning is going, just a few details to work out, but most of the major stuff is done.  Ellie (our new cat) is settling in nicely.  She really likes us, we really like her.  The dog likes to play with her, and she's not really sure about that, but will play every once in a while.  They get along just fine, so that's good. :)  She figured out the dog door pretty quickly, so she goes and hangs out outside a bit, and wanders around the neighboorhood a little I think.  She always comes back, and no scars or anything, so she seems capable. :)

Well, that's all for now. :)"

"event","Well, this is not from my brand new iPhone, nor is it about my new iPhone being in my hand and being really cool.  Rather, its about my brand new iPhone receipt that says I'll be getting a new iPhone in 7-10 days.  Apparently all of the AT&T stores ran out of phones pretty quickly.  I think I heard that the Apple stores still had them around, but it probably would have complicated things more, since I wanted to setup a family plan, and get Sharon a new phone too.

So they have this thing called Direct Fulfillment Order, so this basically means that an iPhone is shipping specifically with my name on it. (not literally)

I was kinda hoping to have the phone before next weekend, when Sharon and I are driving to Vegas for the day.  We're leaving here Saturday morning, get to Vegas about 6 hours later, check in, do some gambling, who knows what else.  We've got a show to go to, for the artist Godard, who did our painting/print behind our bar, as well as a Wedding gift from Nancy.  Sharon really wants to meet him, and get some signatures. :)  Which is really the purpose of this trip, not my birthday. ;)"

"event","This past weekend was OTP, our yearly gathering of people that are equally crazy, in different yet complimenting ways!  Sharon and I got on a plane way too early Friday morning, and arrived way too late in Raleigh.  We showed up at the house and there were people working on the tree house, people sitting around on the lawn watching, and  people gathering to head to the movies.  We went down the hug line, heard which movie they were going to.  Sharon really wanted to see Walee, so she went off with them.  I put our stuff down and immediately headed over to the treehouse, assessed the situation, and started working. :)

We made some adjustments, put together a more solid plan, and started hammering.  By the end of the day, we had a full floor frame put together.  Next step was to acquire flooring in the morning.  We did deck boards, which worked out really well.  That was acquired in the morning, by the time we got it back to the house, it was sushi time.  After sushi, the rain had just finished, so we got started on the flooring.  Almost all boards were on and tacked by the time the rains came.

Thunderstorms rolled in, lightening commenced, rain poured down, and then we danced!  I joined the crazy people out on the deck, in the rain, dancing.  It was actually really nice to rinse off all of the grime from the day, but boy was the rain cold! :)  After that, there was much talking, relaxing, chatting, catching up, etc.

Sunday was a bit slower, these kinda days wear on you after a while. ;)  We made some more progress on the treehouse, finishing the decking, setting posts for a railing, figuring out how to do a trap door, and how to put railings on the outside as a temporary safety guard. (with 1 bolt ;)  We needed more materials to continue, so Sharon put together a list of houses to check out, and Rob drove us around looking at a few, talking about neighborhoods, etc.  We measured the distance from them to the Home Depot (very important ;), and eventually made it back to the house with some more supplies.  There wasn't enough time to do anything with them before it started raining some more, but atleast we have everything there now.

The rest of the evening was fairly slow, finding food, I did some notes and drawings on how to complete the treehouse to be useful.  Mostly the railings, and the trap door.  Sharon apparently found it surprising that I could do some good architecture diagrams with perspective. *sigh*  These should hopefully be up on the Wiki, for those that have access, sometime soon... Rob! :)  The night ended with a very odd game, who's name escapes me, about a haunted house that dynamically builds itself.

6am was WAY too early on Monday morning, but we made it.  Unfortunately we didn't get a lot of goodbyes in the morning, but I think we got all of ours out the night before.  Got back home about 1pm, after picking up the dog.  I have to say, as much as I hated getting up that early, it was nice to have a lot of the day to start recovering.  It may have made work today a little less horrible, but going back to work really sucked. :)

<b>Smell:</b> Smoked Hickory

Its been a very busy couple of weeks!  Last weekend my parents, sister, and 2 nephews came for a visit.  Its summertime, so everyone is out of school.  They made a driving trip across the country, spending some time at my brother's in Dallas, and then here.  Various places along the way.  So we spent some time getting the house ready for that.  Not that we could have prepared too much.  I have a 16 year old nephew with Asperger's Disorder, and a 5 year who's a menace. :)  Bonnie did quite well putting up with them. ;)

We didn't do too much while they were here, cause really, there are a lot of great outdoor things to do around here, but its hard to do them when its 112!  But it was great to see them!

Work has been... busy!  I'm doing planning for the program for the rest of the year, trying to meet goals.  And everything has to be planned out fairly well, so a little bit stressful.

This weekend is kinda a quiet one.  I'm currently smoking a brisket on our grill.  Sharon marinated it, got it all ready, and I've been cooking it while she's at work.  She had some off-hours work to do today, which is good, cause its extra money. :)  Tomorrow will probably be some Tux shopping (yeah, I still haven't figured that part out, but I don't have to plan as far ahead as Sharon does for her dress. ;)  So, hopefully I'll figure this out tomorrow.  Probably try to catch a movie while we're out, I think Sharon wants to see Wal-E, mostly for the shopping cart scene. ;)

And its just one week till a whole bunch of crazy people swarm on a poor family's house in Raleigh!!! :)  Its been too long.  I wish we were getting their earlier, but too much other stuff going on this year. (some crazy event in Oct ;)  So hopefully they won't screw up the tree house before I get there. ;)"

"event","Well, I've manage to make it through 2 days with Sharon being gone.  The dog is still alive (me too obviously), the house is still standing, no major disasters, and I've managed to feed myself. ;)

Sharon's visiting her parents this weekend, doing wedding and family stuff, taking advantage of the long weekend.  I really wasn't up for a trip back there, and probably best to save the cost of airfare for other trips later this year. :)  She left Friday afternoon, and will be back Monday night.
Friday was pretty quiet, just finishing up work, shopping, and relaxing in front of the TV.  I tried to deposit a check at the ATM also, but that failed... I'll get to it in a minute.  Dinner Friday night was steamed shrimp with Old Bay seasoning! :)  Sharon doesn't like shrimp, so they never get fixed in this house.  So while I was at the store, they had a good sale on raw shrimp.  I picked up some old bay seasoning, and all was good.

Yesterday I started off by going to the bank first thing.  I had tried to deposit my check into the ATM, and in the process, the ATM machine crashed.  Its one of the newer bank of america atms that doesn't use an envelope for checks, it just reads them in, OCRs them, and usually guesses the amount of the check.  It makes for faster processing I suppose.  Well, I put in the check, and normally it shows a picture of the check.  It didn't, it just showed something like those red Xs when a web browser can't load an image.  So I cancel it, it spits the check back out, and I try again.  This time when I insert the check, the thing goes crazy, throwing up windows fatal errors, blue screening, and eventually rebooting.  I could see that the machine runs Windows XP. ;)  I waited for a while to see if maybe it would give me my card and/or check back.  But no luck.  I probably waited for 10 minutes, had to wave some people around that were waiting in my atm line (it was a drive through atm).  So I was hoping that if I went in first thing, the bank would have my card and check, and be able to give it back.  Nope, I went in, they put me in an office and called the ""lost card"" place or something.  Canceled my existing card, ordered me a new one and issued a claim for my check.  It seems its going to take a few days to get the money, so I had to make a transfer to make sure bills are covered. *sigh*  They said 7-10 days is their normal statement, but sometimes its sooner.  It really does seem kinda long for a failure in their machine. :-/  They were then going to issue me a temp card at the bank, but I didn't need it.  I just did a withdraw to make sure I had enough money until I got the card.  Everyone was very friendly, apologetic and helpful.  I just don't particularly like the process for this.  Oh well, not much I can do.

So, after that, I picked up some breakfast at BK, I figured I earned it.  Drove home, and relaxed in front of the TV some more.  Eventually I got moving again, headed out.  I went to the mall just to be outside, grab a pretzel, and relax.  I was gonna see Speed Racer, since Sharon doesn't seem interested in it.  But the theater was a little crowded.  Probably for Indy, but still. :)  I might go give it another shot today.  Having given up on that, I headed home, but decided to take random ways, exploring some of the farther reaches of Queen Creek.  On my travels, I saw a sign about San Tan County Park.  For those of you that have been here, the San Tan mountains are the ones that you can see out of guest bedroom window. (I had put a picture up when we first moved in)  I have been wondering for ages about how to climb/hike them.  So I made the turn and followed the signs.  It appears there is a park on the other side of them from us, with a few relatively short trails.  But they seem to have some good elevation.  I figure this might be a nice hike for OTT, since its close by.  When we finally leave the house at 4pm, we'll still have some daylight left by the time we get there. ;)  It faces East, so probably not quite the good sunsets, but something new and fun. :)

Afterwards, I continued down the road I was on, which went through the park some more, and apparently just dead ends eventually.  Before it dead ends, the pavement ends, and it seems to go into this community.  It was an odd eclectic set of various types of houses and properties.  My poor little Acura wasn't too happy with the road though. ;)  It had those... ""ribs"" I guess that some dirt roads have.  I'm not really sure what they are, except painful.  I thought my car was going to rattle apart!

Then more relaxing, getting some work done, etc.  And obviously some dog walks in there. ;)  I really wanted to go hiking yesterday, but we got about 2 and a half days of rain that just ended mid-day yesterday, I figured the trails wouldn't be too spectacular. :)  I was considering going hiking today, and I still am.  But I'm not sure if I'm fully up to it.  Might just relax, and go see Speed Racer instead. :)"

We were in Home Depot Sat, I was looking at treehouse building stuff. :)  Sharon went over to the book section, and was flipping through them, and got me and pointed to a small bench, and said, ""I want that"".  So I made some notes, then Sat evening, I made up a sketch, and a shopping list.

Sunday, I went over, bought some wood and a couple tools, came home, and built it.  The only thing I wasn't able to finish was the top, as I did not buy enough of that wood. (on purpose, cause I hadn't figure out what I wanted to do yet)  So I went and got that and finished it today.  I was sitting on it out front with the dog when Sharon pulled up. ;)

Today was more relaxing, some shopping for food, seeing Ironman, and a trip out to the barn to see Velvet.

A few quick words about Ironman.  I thought it was really cool!  I want to be as cool as Stark! :-D  From his tech knowledge, to the private jet with the stripper pole in it! ;)

Last weekend, I hoped on a plane Saturday morning, and made poor <lj user=""targie""> get out of bed at a horrible hour of 10am or so.  We headed back to his place to relax a bit, get a tour of his new digs (which is pretty cool btw), and then head back out.  We went over to <lj user=""l_stboy"">'s place, decided to get some lunch at a local bagel place, and relax for a little bit.  After showing up there, we were informed that after our sailing adventure, we'd be heading out to a favorite speakeasy (I can't tell you any more about that, or it wouldn't be a speakeasy ;).  Because of this, Rob and I headed back to his place to get a change of cloths more appropriate for this than our sailing cloths. ;)

Then it was off to the local port, and hop on a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Washington"">big boat</a>.  Which, btw, is the HMS Interceptor from the first Pirates movie. ;)  I must say, the battle sailing was ALOT of fun, not to mention just being out on the water!  It was very windy, and a little rough, but that just made it all the better. :-D  I miss water!

Afterwards, we headed into the city, got some Thai, and had a nice relaxing time at a very private place. :)  Any place that requires a password to get in, is definitely an experience. ;)  Afterwards, we weren't quite ready to call it a night, so we walked down the street to to a favorite Irish pub of Terry's, with a quick stop to get pre-req greasy pizza to sustain us. ;)  Then another couple pints later, we were finally ready to go.

Sunday was a much lazier day.  Rob took me to pick up the rental and then we were off to the hotel to check me in.  Then it was time for some food.  Rob decided I should see Los Gatos, as it was a very ""Sharon"" place. :)  And we had some good food at a local brewery.  Then it was back to his place, watch the season premier of BSG, and then Rob needed a nap. :)  Crazy old folk!  Then after some resting, we headed over to casa de T for <a href=""http://l-stboy.livejournal.com/181142.html"">Sunday Dinner</a>.  It was a great time with some good people.  I've made it to a couple of these, and I think every time it had different people, but they're always good. :)

Monday was the big day.  A day full of interviews at the big G.  I was happy that the interviews were a bit harder than the phone interviews.  Some things I didn't know, some I did.  I think I did quite well, but we'll see. :)  I just got a call from my recruiter this evening, so I'll have to call him back tomorrow and see what's up.  If I pass, I won't get an actual offer for a couple more weeks.  So I won't know much until then.  If I get an offer, then Sharon and I will have some decisions to make.  If I don't, then she gets her way.  But we'll see. :)

Tuesday was a flight back, then I headed straight into work for some face to face meetings.  Got some things straightened out.  The rest of the week was cleaning up from that stuff.  One thing I figured out with me being out for 1.5 days, was the that people I thought could cover me are not up for it.  So because of that, and with one of the guys taking a position outside of our team, I worked with the lead to do some re-orgs that put me in a different position on the same program, and hand off what I've been working on to someone else.  Its a win-win for both of us.  It moves him ""up"", and gives him some better and different experience.  It also moves me to something else, cause I was getting close to being burnt out.  Pretty much everyone at work thinks this is a good move, so I'd say that makes it a successful juggle. :)  Only problem we have, is a lack of the right people, but that's a bigger IBM problem. *sigh*

The weekend was a nice quiet slow weekend.  Sharon got her car washed, I turned my mac mini into a custom PVR, all its missing is a remote... but I've been scoping those out. ;)  We attempted to take a swim, but the pool was a bit too cold for comfort.  And I got the side gate stained, which is something I've been meaning to do for a few weeks.

And then a new week starts, and, well... its a Monday.  Enough said there!"

I've been SWAMPED at work, of course that doesn't even begin to cover it. :)  But its all good, I've apparently made myself too good here, so everyone comes to me.  That's really about all I wanna say there. :)

Speaking of jobs... <lj user=""targie""> put my resume for a job with him a Google.  After a phone screening and two technical interviews, they still seem to like me.  So they're flying me out this weekend for an in person interview on Monday. :)  Nice of them to pay for a weekend to see Rob's new place and be a pirate. :)  Between Rob and Terry, they're filling up my time nicely. :)

Last weekend we got to go to Fest for the last weekend with Sharon's friend and her brother.  It was good to get one last AZ fest in.  We're already planning to go MD fest, just not sure when.  It will be sometime in early/mid Sept.  We'll fly out there, go to a football game, get a marriage license, and go to Fest. :)

Also last weekend, I finally got to go flying with a couple guys from work.  They were doing IFR flying to keep up their ratings, and figured they had a back seat open. :)  So, I didn't actually get to fly, but did get to go up.  I took a camera, but the stupid CF card crapped out, so I didn't get any other pictures!!! :-/  Guess I'll just have to go back up again. :)  If you wanna see some of the route we took.  This appears to just be most of the way down to Tucson.

Saturday, we got up slowly, and started to get ready.

My legs are still killing me from that run! :)  I've been doing quite well at exercising, but apparently running uses some very different muscles! :)  But I was NOT about to let that slow me down, at least not until after they left. ;)  So we finished getting ready, took showers, and headed off to fest.  It was a great day, we got to see a number of good shows.  Stuff on sticks, leather, and fairies! :)  And the weather was great, which is always an added bonus.

Saturday night, we were all exhausted after such a long day, so we decided to make it simple and relaxing.  We ordered some chinese food from around the corner, and watched a movie on the couch.  It was a nice way to end the day, and the couch curling was very welcomed. :)

Sunday was a very slow day.  We got up a little later, Todd and Jenn did NOT convince me to go running that morning. ;)  We finally got moving in time to head downtown and have a good burger at Sharon's favorite place.  Then we wandered around the Botanical Gardens for a while.  Todd wanted to see cacti, so we obliged. ;)  And again, it was a great day to be outdoors.  After that, it wasn't quite time to say goodbye, so we headed over to Tempe lake. (yes Tyra, there IS water in AZ! ;)  Todd and Sharon weren't up for moving much, so they found a nice bench, and Jenn and I did some walking.  There's a really nice path along the lake. :)  After a walk down and back, it was time to go.  We dropped them off at the airport, and I drove home so Sharon didn't pass out. :)  She found a nice spot to stay on the couch for a while, I tried to start recovering my legs a little bit.

Then as dinner time approached, I headed back to Tempe to catch up with an old boss from UMBC, Jack.  I guess technically he's still in my report chain, since I still contract to UMBC. ;)  He comes to the area at least once a year, but this is the first time he's actually contacted me BEFORE he left. :)  So I met him down there, and we had some dinner, beers, and chatted about life and jobs. :)  It was good to catch up, get a perspective from him on careers, and share some stories. :)

So, that was my great weekend! :)  I'm sure we can convince T & J to come back again.  I think a summer trip is in order, with some tubing down the river. :)

Next weekend, we've got some more company.  Sharon's mother and brother are coming into town, so we'll be back at the fest. :)  Who knows what else is in store."

"event","Okay, I can finally post it here, since all of the required parties have been told. :)  We were waiting until we told our families, and then till now so we were at home. :)

On Christmas day, I asked Sharon to marry me. :)  And the crazy little girl said yes. ;)  And since everyone asks, the answer is ""no, we haven't set a date"".  There are many details to work out, like what kind of wedding, where, and when that is available. :)  We're much more concerned about having the right wedding, instead of the right time.  But Sharon has said she wants a Fall wedding, with the fall colors in the trees.  Tentatively its set for somewhere in Pennsylvania.

For those that would like to know, I had the ring box inside of a larger box filled with rocks. (isn't that so my style? :))  She picked it up, it was heavy.  She shook it, it sounded broken.  She opened it, she was speechless. :)  Needless to say, I won Christmas. ;)

Pictures are obviously forth coming, but may be a few days.  We need to recover from some... bad travel karma. :-/  More on that later. ;)

And because it was amusing that this was the Wiki How-to of the day:

Sharon and I are quite happy with our gifts.  Plenty of electronics and other good stuff. :)  Sharon got me a Nuvi 360 GPS unit.  Which is apparently the exact same one my parent's got. :)"

"event","So, after about 2+ years of knowing her online through LJ, <lj user=""azfiregirl""> was having a ""semester's over"" celebration at a local Irish pub on Thursday.  So Sharon and I went out to meet her! :)  She's a lot of fun, and has some good (and some strange) friends! ;)  Yay for finally actually meeting!  We've tried a number of times, and always failed for some reason or another.

Sharon thinks its strange to go meet someone you met online.  Personally, I find it quite normal, but I've never been a stranger to strange. ;)

Now that I'm caught up on Live journal, its time to go pack.  Sharon and I are driving up to Prescott, AZ this evening for her company Christmas getaway thingy. :)  They pay for dinner, a hotel room, and breakfast tomorrow.  So its a good all paid expenses getaway.  The only thing we have to pay for is to put the dog in the kennel, and get ourselves up there.

I hope everyone is having a good weekend!

Also, we'll be up in Maryland/New Jersey around New Years.  We have my family gathering on Saturday, and then we'll be doing New Years at <lj user=""jpenamelist""> and <lj user=""callmetc"">'s place. :)  The rest of the time we'll probably spend in the car, or visiting with Sharon's family."

 oh my nerves was bad. he said when i try this key and if it dont work, try wiggaling on the steering wheel. well i tried it and even the steering wheel thing and it still didnt work. oh i knew it, until some man came over to try, got to wiggalin on the wheel and what do ya know, the damn thing started. i wanted to give him a big oh kiss,, but we all know you jus cant give a total stranger a kiss. that was a crazy expierence that i do not want to ever happen again. its all good now though."

"event","well its been a nice day all day and i heard its going to stay that way throughout the weekend, thats good. hopefully its nice tonite.we get to go trick or treating. ive only lived here in middletown for a year in a half so ive got the area we are going to go in. last year, there were alot of hills up and down. my four year old was not happy and neither was i when he was wanting me to hold him bout 45 minutes into it. you would think he was outta shape or somethin. maybe he'll hold up better this year. not my 10 year old though, i had to keep telling him to hold up.
jayson,4, is out of all things a cowboy. thats another thing i was trippin when thats what he picked out. he looks cute though. jay jay,10, a scary mask with green and black hair and a cape.
ive had to threatin to take away, he keeps scaring jayson. he does look scary too."

"event","no not plans to do anything exciting.chemistry needs to start making a lot more sense so i am dedicating this long weekend to try to do just that.I can always find more interesting things to do like laundry,dishes(which is my dreadful household duty,kids stuff,things that needed to be done a long time ago deals.I know the deal its because i do not like chemistry at all that it gets put off always for the last.So i will see if I can put some liveness to it,cause this will not work for the rest of the semester. Hopefully i will return tuesday with a mad scientist attitude."

"event","we all ready. as ready as im gonna be. we have our first exam in accounting today. fun. we'll ive been keeping up in at least this class. looked over materials again, i think. I like the professor , he cracks me up. sometimes when you think you got it down, he goes and starts to confuse you. personal opinion. the quizes in his class are cool cause he makes you get a good grade or he'll have you do it over. W hich in some ways seems elementry but he wants to make sure you are getting it. But that ends out working in your favor,cause all your quizes will be no less than like a 96. This my change but its sure helps thus far."

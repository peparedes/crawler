"event","I called yesterday to see about Ethan's head start and they told me he won't be able to go at all this year unless someone pulls their kid out, cause there are so many kids that go there now.  They don't have room for anymore at the moment. And as far as they know, he won't be going until next fall, until we are otherwise notified.  I called a daycare in dayton and they said they will charge 71 dollars a week. So I can't imagine what the others around here will charge. Besides I don't even have a job yet. I just feel so hopeless. I feel like the past 3 years of my life have been a waste, cause I really haven't done anything with my life. I guess that is my fault...We can never change what happened in the past, but we always have the power to change the future...but my future just seems like the previous year and so on. No one ever truly knows for sure what their future will be like, but they at least have some idea. They at least have a plan.  I have nothing.  ""maybe someday, is the last time, maybe someday is the end...maybe someday, is when it all stops, or maybe someday always comes again..."""

"event","Halloween was ok I guess. Ethan went as a skeleton.  I bought him a black long sleeve shirt that had bones on the arms and ribs in the center of the shirt, which they all glow in the dark.  I tried to find some matching pants, but everytime I went to wal mart, which was where i got the shirt, there was nothing. You would think if they are going to sell the shirt, they would at least sell the pants to match it. Anyway, I just found him a pair of plain black pants made out of the same material as the shirt.  I painted his face so it looked pale and used my eyeliner to put a few cracks on his face. He looked so cute. Me and David took him trick or treating down my Aunt Dian's street and at the Sale Creek Church of God's 'Trunk or Treat.' We also took him to the new church in Bakewell's trunk or treat.  He got most of his candy from the churches. There was a guy dressed as beetlejuice at the church in Bakewell. Ethan did NOT like him at all.  I took Ethan's picture before he went trick or treating, so once I get to my mom's i will set them up on photobucket.com.  I have the camera here (david's parents) but I don't have the cords to hook it up.  Shucks.  For some reason, RadioAOL still has the Halloween station available...oh well.  My fingernails are still black from Halloween."

I have to leave here in a few to take ethan to his speech therapy. I really don't want to go all the way to chattanooga, especially looking like crap. But he's got to go.  Can't decide if I'm gonna stop at taco bell on the way and get me a mexi-melt...those things are soooooo good.  Me and mom were gonna go to hixson tonight but I probably won't feel like especially after making one trip to chattanooga already.  I think I will just get David to watch him in the morning instead of tonight that way we will have all day tomorrow to do whatever. I have sat here all week and I'm ready for something to do.  I might look for a halloween costume for Ethan. ::sighs:: Mine and david's anniversary is coming up. Next Friday to be exact.  Oh shit...I have to go....bye."

But I have to keep trying to do so, so I can get my tags renewed.  It's a miracle that I haven't been pulled over yet.  Mom is coming to get me and ethan sometime today. I have a lot I need to do, like unpack some boxes, but my stomach keeps cramping...I hope its just gas.  I really don't feel like doing much of anything right now.  I think I will try to do something in about 30 minutes.  Heh...I'm watching the 700 hundred club.  My mind feels like a huge blur at the moment.  Can't really think right now for some reason.  Me and JB are going to ziggy's tomorrow night.  I have to find something to wear, but I have no idea what. I'm also gonna try to get my haircut today as well.  They are only $2.99 at the Great Clips in Soddy.  Yep, Soddy...they also have a movie gallery and are building a Wendy's as we speak.  All right beside the wal mart.  How convenient.

I still have to get the shit out of the back storage room and some loose items here and there, not to mention the trash.  I have a load of crap that needs to be taken to the dump as well.  It really pisses me off that I don't have aol on this computer anymore. Of course I have AIM, but its just not the same as the actual service.  I can still use it at my mom's but, only as a guest which is way better than nothing. I was suppose to renew my tag on my car by september 30th...and its now october 4th and i still haven't been able to do so.  I hope and pray I don't get pulled over on the way home.  The shitty thing about the internet here is I don't even have email service. I became members of yahoo and hotmail, but it won't even let me sign in.  David has this computer set up to where only he can have access to certain things. It really pisses me off.  I really don't feel like going anywhere at the moment, but I hate sitting here all day.  David is working with his Dad today.  He kept harassing me about why I didn't want to sleep in the same bed as him.  Well lets see, there are a number of things. I can't stand sleeping next to someone for starters and if I do I can't stand to be touched.  He actually thought me, him, and ethan were all going to sleep in the same bed.  Hell no, there's no way we can all fit. If I didn't have this problem with my skin, being touched wouldn't be a problem.  When my skin is really broken out like it is now, even the slightest touch will irritate it. I can't seem to get that through david's thick skull.  well i have to go."

You hold my eyes in yours

"event","ok so like we've gotten all the furniture out of the apartment and into the house and storage.  Now it is a matter of cleaning out the rest of our old bedroom and closet...not to mention the hall closet. I will be so glad when I will be done with all this moving bullshit. I stayed at david's parents last night and i had to come back to sale creek this morning so I could do so I can do some work at the apartment.  I really can't do much cause i'm out of tape, but I can move whatever is in the closets into the last box that I have. I desperately need more boxes and some tape.  I have to call and set ethan up an appointment with a neurologist, because his parents stil3 l insist that he has autism, from the simple fact that hes not making conversation.  Of course he's not he has a speech delay. He wants to talk, he just can't quite put it into words yet.  He tries really hard to communicate.  We will probably see a big change after he turns 3 which will be next month.  The speech therapy should be effective.  I feel like crap right now. I really don't want to go back to the apartment but I don't have much of a choice. My stomach hurts."

"event","i woke up this morning and it was cold as hell. I guess hell really isn't that cold, but you get the idea.  I got up and turned on the oven so it could heat up and I fixed myself some cereal.  We are suppose to have everything out of our apartment by today, but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. David has been sick and the rain has held us up quite a bit.  In fact, I am doing some of the laundry right now.  I'm going to head down to david's parents about noonish.  Mom is suppose to pick me up this evening sometime.   I need to go back to the apartment and do some last minute things but I can't do much of anything with Ethan there so it is really pointless. Well I do need to go back and get David his BDU's.  Mom is coming to get me this evening and I guess I will be staying here until sunday evening. She really wanted me to stay the night down there tonight and she would pick me up in the morning, but I really don't know if I want to stay that long, especially since they have been sick. I'd like to wait for the germs to die down at least. And of course his mom has slept on the couch the entire time she has been sick so I guess its really good and contaminated by now.  ::sighs:: She was cleaning up everything yesterday so I guess it will be somewhat safer today. Ethan also has speech therapy today.  What really annoys me, is that david spent his entire check the other day on groceries at bi lo...and you know that doesn't go real far.  He had maybe a handful of groceries. To beat all, he bought all expensive stuff. He knew I needed vaccum bags so I could vaccum out the apartment before we leave.  I could just use my mom's but hers is too damn heavy. I'd be worn out just by carrying the damn thing up the stairs. Mine is a featherlite...so its really light. I also needed to get some mr.clean magic erasers so I could get most of the marks off the walls that ethan has made with pens and crayons. That little turd...He wrote all over one of the closet doors with an inkpen.  Our landlord is going to kill us, if he doesn't sue us first.  But they have people who come in and paint all the time.  Like everytime someone moves out.  The painter is sure going to have a workout.  What is with kids wanting to write on everything?  I have a big problem.  Brian goes back to work tonight so we don't have a truck to move with.  David's Dad's truck can only haul things on a trailer, cause there are boxes and a ladder rack on the back of his truck.  And David has drill tomorrow and sunday.  He will just have to call the landlord and tell him we will need at least until the 4th of october, which is when they are suppose to cut off the electricity.  That will give us until Tuesday.  I still have to clean out the closets upstairs and downstiars, plus the ones in the bed rooms. I also have to get Ethan's baby bed out.  So much work to be done.  Me and mom are going over there tomorrow and this evening maybe to work on the closets.

"event","well when i woke up at david's parents house yesterday morning, I found out he had been up all night puking and that they weren't going to work that day.  So I came on up here to my mom's cause i didn't want to spend the entire day down there doing nothing. I wanted to go through some things at the apartment as well, but of course I never did. I just didn't feel like it. i needed a break.  I plan to do that today though. Well...back to my story.  I basically hung out at my mom's all day and last night i went walking down at the school with my brother and my aunt. I called down there to talk to david and his mom answered with a very weak voice.  She said they were all sick and throwing up down there so it would be best if I stayed up here until they got better.  I called this morning hoping to talk to david but he was still asleep. And of course I used my last diaper on ethan before we went walking last night. I stopped by my house and found two pull ups he could wear for the time being. Now I'm gonna have to make a trip all the way down to their house just to get the diapers and to get money so i can have some gas for on the way back home.  This really sucks cause, they were suppose to work today.  I just hate going all the way down there just for diapers. Oh well, he's got to have them.  I'd have to make a trip to wal mart anyway, with the money i don't have.  Thats always nice.  ::sighs::  I really dred the drive down there...its only a 15 minute drive...but still.  Its rainy out.  I am definitely gonna have to go by my house and get my cds before i leave. Ethan is watching The Backyardigans on NickJr."

"event","ok so last night was my first night at david's parents.  It wasnt too bad.   I slept on the couch cause i wanted to watch tv before i went to bed and besides david was getting on my nerves.  It really pissed me off to find out that he had deleted aol entirely off our computer, since we would be using a cable modem.  I still have aol, just not on that computer.  I will probably be here at my mom's all this coming weekend so i can do some last minute things to our apartment before we leave completely such as cleaning and what not.   I will be glad once everything goes where it is suppose to.  I still have to get the washer and dryer out and I don't have a clue when that will be.  Ugh...all of this is just too much work. Our biggest problem was that none of our shit was packed up.  We basically started to pack up shit the day we started to move things out. One thing about it, is that everything in storage will be mine, so when i get ready to move i can just easily go get it.  I registered ethan on monday for headstart and they put him on a waiting list to even see if he can get in.  I can't do anything about a job until he starts school.  It might be another month from now before I will find out something. My life feels so confused right now. All I know is what is happening now.  I have no idea what will happen tomorrow or the day after that.  It seems I have lost all direction."

"event","ok, so we have to be moved out by the first and we haven't even started to pack our things. I haven't got any boxes yet, but some people are suppose to drop off some today.  We really need to go ahead and get a storage space so we can go ahead and start taking things over there. The quicker we can get everything out the better. I'm probably going to be mopping all the floors tonight, in-case the water is turned off tomorrow. Ugh...its going to be so weird when i come to my mom's and not go to that apartment when i want to go home.  We will have lived there for 3 years this spring.  I will really miss it, despite the grinch of a landlord we had and the damn racoons that kept getting into the trash.  I saw the neighbors dog out there once and just the other day there were like 5 racoons on my back porch and they had knocked the trash over.  I won't be missing that, for sure.  I just think I'm really going to hate living with david's parents, but i don't have much of a choice. So i'm trying not to think of the negative things about it.  It's just his dad is so damn weird. I will be in the kitchen at my house doing the dishes or something and he will just come in the kitchen to stare. When I turn around and give him the, 'wtf is your problem' look...he just walks out. I told david flat out how uncomfortable his dad made me feel.  He didn't have much of a reply.  Good thing is that me and ethan will be the only ones there for the most part of the day so I can bathe or whatever I have to do before they even get home.  Besides they have cable, lol.  I think what I'm going to do for christmas is when it comes time to decorate is that since i don't have my own place, i will just decorate my mom's house.  We will be spending christmas in my aunt's new house this year, which i am looking forward to cause she wants me to come up and help with her christmas tree.  I will miss going to her old house cause i practically grew up in that house. I have picutres of my very first christmas in that house.  I told her we might need to have one last dinner, lol a moving out dinner. And I think for halloween i'm just going to bring him up here to trick or treat.  I know almost everyone here in sale creek and i know like no one where david's parents live.  I just don't like the idea of my kid getting candy from people i don't know.

"event","ok so i went to my cousin's funeral the other day.  It was pretty sad i must admit. I had to sit outside in the lobby of the funeral home cause the sanctuary was full, but i could hear everything that was being said over the intercom in the hallways.   Just hearing her husband crying while he was talking was enough to make me start crying.  And of course, I miss her.  I didn't go to the graveyard for that part of the funeral cause i just get too emotional.   I did however go to the dinner thing at my aunt's house afterwards.  

Me and david got into another fight this morning cause i wanted to come over to my mom's so i could dry some clothes. Mine was full and her dryer takes no time to dry them.  He took the keys and told me i couldn't go anywhere, because it was his gas that was in the car and said if i wanted to go anywhere i could put my own gas in it.  Everything pretty much escolated from there.   The arguement was pretty bad, but i just told him flat out that its never going to work between us and that as soon as i can get a job, i am gone.  i really didn't want him to know that just yet, but i just felt like i had to say it.  Then he has the nerve to say...'you know, we're just not happy together'  wow, as if that was some newsflash... was what i said.  i have to go home soon to take his ass the car so he can go pay the rest of the rent.  For those of you who don't know...we are moving in with his parents. I honestly don't know how long I can deal with that, but I hope and pray God will help me through it.  It will definitely save us money...but i'm not handing over my entire check to them either. I don't mind helping with the groceries.  I still haven't heard anything about a job, of course i don't have a phone either...lol. I'm about to call them and give them my mom's number."

"event","Ok...so i went to my interview this morning. I got up and got ready and of course david had to go cash his check and put gas in the car at the last minute before I could even go anywhere. I had to stop on the way down to buy some deoderant at wal mart cause i didn't have any at home. I so thought i was going to be late.  I got down to the street i needed to turn at in chattanooga and about freaked out once i did thinking it was the wrong street. I thought, there's no way i can afford to get lost especially if i'm late. Well...i turned to the right and there was the place. whew...that was a close one.  anyway, not only did i go straight to it, but i was like 10 minutes early.  I wasn't nervous at all thank god.   I had to go up to the 3rd floor where i waited on a guy name joel who was the interviewer. He told me to 'walk down the hall and into the 2nd door on your left.'  my stomach went upside down when i seen 2 other people in there.  I had to talk to 3 different people.  I was so unprepared for that and the questions they were asking me.  Like,  'why do you want a job in medical records' what i really wanted to say was, well i have bills i need to pay, they just turned my phone off today, and i need a job in the worst way.  i basically told him i wanted the experience doing that sort of thing and i think it would be good to go on my record. I told him i was an excellent typer, typist...whatever it is.  But each one of those people had the coldest stare.  It seems like each time i seen them staring at me...it felt like forever before they would stop, which just made things worse.  I didn't get any replies from anything i said and i basically felt like a dumbass when i left the room.  They said they would for sure contact me whether they wanted me or not by letter or by phone. I guess it will have to be by letter cause i don't have a phone anymore.  I thought i was going to cry when i got to my car.  the only thing i know will give me the job if that is the case is the fact that my mother in law works there. cause he asked how i knew sandy parker and i told him, he just raised his eyebrows...like 'wow'  but that was the only eyebrow raise i got.  oh well. I'm just lucky i even made it that far without being nervous.  It would take a miracle for me to get that job.   I called rhea county hospital earlier and they said they were reviewing applications for the rest of the week and they would be calling people for interviews.  I gave them my mom's number for another contact number, since she has voice mail at least they would be able to leave a message.  I just feel really disappointed in myself.   But its kind of hard to tell someone what they want to hear when you have no work experience or work history.  blah...i tried."

"event","Well the other day, my cousin who had been on dialysis sp, for 30 years passed away.  She was very close to me, my mom, and my brother, however we didn't see her much.   Basically the medication she had been recently taking made her liver turn bad and her entire body just went downhill from there. My aunt diane seen her at the hospital the day before she died and said her feet and legs had already turned black and the inside of her mouth was already black.  Almost as if she were already starting to decay, even though she was alive.  She has been through so much and she can finally be at peace now.  My aunt audrey said in her final moments, she spoke to my unlce earl who passed away about 4 years ago.   And said that he had come to sit with her.  Ethan was born on his birthday oddly enough.  My cousin was married to a preacher and they both loved to ride motorcycles.  Her brother jerry and his wife are both harley fanatics and each have their own bike, so they want everyone in the family and any friends they have that have bikes to meet at the funeral home tomorrow and lead the hearse to the cemetery.  Her favorite color was pink, so they got her a pink casket and are getting her all kinds of pink flowers.  I honestly don't know if I can handle going to the funeral home tonight because the last thing she said to me was for me to bring ethan to her house to see her and i never did.  The least I can do is go see her one last time tonight, regardless if i can handle it or not.  The guy at the funeral home said her veins were so worn out that if they were to embalm her, that any sores she had on her, it would leak through them.   As far as I know, from 3-5 will be family and from 5-9 will be family and friends. I was over at her mother's house yesterday, who is my great aunt on my mom's side.  Everyone just got together and talked about old times.  It's really sad to think about it, but seeing her mother and brother cry makes me want to cry.  And I'm sure it will tear me up to see her husband crying...I couldn't imagine his pain or anybody else's in the family as well.  One thing about it, she's not suffering anymore. She's in a place where she will always be beautiful."

Its very executive-ish... if that makes sense...looks like something a lawyer would wear. I actually bought that shirt to wear to a wedding once.  I won't wear a dress or skirt if i can avoid it.  If i were to go shopping for one, i would be on a search for days.  Besides I'm flat broke. I really hope and pray I get that job, cause Ethan's birthday is coming up and after that it will be Christmas. It would break my heart if I couldn't get him anything for either of those occasions...especially not being able to give him a birthday party.  As it turns out, we have to come up with over $500 just to stay here another month.  We still owe $80 from the last time we paid our rent.  If our water isn't paid by thursday...it will be cut off.  I have a phone bill which i have no idea how late that is. And mom had to pay my gas bill the other day, just to keep them from turning it off. We seriously might be having to move in with david's parents till we/I can get on our feet I don't particularly want to, but if it means saving money...it would really be worth it.  I first plan to buy my car, once I get enough saved up, then I will be saving towards my own place.  No one really knows that as far as david and his family and i'm wanting to keep that on the down low.  I know living with them will be really hard cause i really can't stand to be around his dad cause he is just like david, but worse.  I really hope I get to go to the show tomorrow night, cause I already told two other people I was going and besides...it's suppose to be a good show.  If not, I will probably just go walking, since I have been trying to get some exercise anyway.  I'd like to go by the place in Hixson to see about the first time buyers plan for single parents that way i will have some sort of idea of how much i need to save or what i need to do better yet. It really sucks to be in this position, but you have to tough out the hard stuff first I guess. We didn't even get to eat much at all today and i have no idea what the hell we are gonna eat tomorrow.  I think I had a kid-size portion of spaghettio's and ethan has been eating waffle sticks all day.  ::sighs:: it really saddens me to think of everything, but I'm trying to keep a straight face cause I know things will eventually get better.  Just a matter of time. I have a gut feeling about it."

I'm so happy I finally got a call. I mean, as the days progressed I just got less worried about it and thought if they were going to call me they would have already done so. You just never know. Now the tricky part. The only interview I have gone to was the one for the dollar general which had no orginazation at all. I mean, it was in the back room with a bunch of other people sitting at a huge table.  Not that it was bad...just it didn't feel like a real interview.  I'm scared I will be nervous on Monday. To beat all I have no idea what to wear. I have only one pair of jeans that fit. I have some kakhis that probably doens't fit anymore and a pair of black dress pants.  I think my mom said something yesterday that if I got an interview for next week sometime that she would help me get some clothes to wear. She doesn't know yet though.  I just want to look nice...not to dressy and not to dressed down.  Casual would be the word i guess?  Any ideas? She already told me yesterday that since the color had worn off my hair she was going to get me some more and do it for me saturday morning, which is a plus cause since most of it has worn off, its getting thinner.  We might be going to enroll ethan in headstart this morning...if I can get david to get up and go with me...like that will ever happen.  We might just end up going tomorrow.  Ugh...i just hope i will be over all this sinus crap.  I am congested and my throat is itchy with some occasional sneezing.  Heh...it could just be my allergies...but still.  I don't want to be talking to the interviewer who can't hardly understand me cause my nose is stopped up. From what I know the job will mostly be typing...which if that is the case I should be great for the job.  Ugh..i'm so nervous and its only thursday.  I have been walking lately and i weighed myself this morning...and I have now lost 7 pounds. I'm gonna try to make it to 10...then to 15 after that and so on and so forth.  I know the last time i mentioned i had lost like 6 pounds well i gained 2 of those back, so I guess walking this week has really burned it off.  I just feel better all over.  I did want to sleep in this morning though.  I'm going to make breakfast."

"event","ok yesterday morning i had a dream that i was on a train and it was going really fast and i remember being really scared...
this is what 'dream moods' had to say...

To dream that you are on a train, is symbolic of your life's journey and suggests that you are on the right track in life and headed for the right direction.  Alternatively,  you have a tendency to worry needlessly over a situation that will prove to work out in the end. 


How does your mind know what to dream?"

"event","ok so like, I was told after turning my application in to call the diagnostic center for an interview?  Don't they usually call you if they are even considering you? You would think they would. So I call one day to see about getting the interview and once I finally got through to someone, they tell me once the supervisor reviews all the applications, I would be getting a call if they were interested in me. That was last week.  So I pretty much thought, there was no way I'd get a call, cause I don't have anything on my application as far as work experience or skills, other than typing skills.  There's no telling how many other applications they have anyway.  But...that has all changed.  David's mom called and said she walked out with the supervisor after work and they were talking about it I guess and the supervisor told her that she would be turning in my application to the people who handle them and is going tell them specifically to call me for an interview.  And told david's mom to be and sure to remind her on monday to do it.  I was talking to my Mom last night and how it would be really good if I could just get my foot in the door. If I get the job, I plan on saving until the first of the year and see how much I have by then. If it's enough, I am moving out.  Besides, I have a bunch of jewelry I'm sure I could pawn, even though I won't get what I paid for it out of it, but still. That is just money I don't have. Besides I can't tell you the last time I've even worn it or when I ever would again.  I could always trade it for something else.  I have like, one necklace, a matching bracelet.  A braclet with my birthstone, a pair of earrings, and of course my wedding rings. I'm seriously thinking about taking the wedding rings and like having zales take the diamonds out and melting the two bands together and like making me a totally different ring out of it.  Cause I hate to get rid of them.  It's not like it would be the same ring.   ::sighs:: Today was family day for david's national guard. Me and ethan were suppose to go, but I really didn't want to.  It was at Harrison Bay State Park... :/  I hope he goes to rodney's afterwards. I swear it feels like I am married to a 13 year old boy. I want a man. LOL.  It's like I keep getting this gut feeling and these signs, that everything is going to be ok when we go our separate ways. I just the mere thought of it actually happening is sort of scary. It's like I'm afraid of change for some reason. I think it would be a good change though.  I mean hell, I watch Ethan everyday of the damn week anyway, so that's not going to change. David can have him on the weekends, then i can do whatever I wanted. I'd have some sort of freedom again.   I'm also gonna try to get me a car.  I just hope it all works out, the way that i feel like it will.  It would be weird though working with david's mom after being divorced, but its not like I can't transfer somewhere else and a lot closer for that matter.  Oh well, I'm talking like I already have the job.  I had to take my last 10 bucks yesterday just to buy a damn mop.  I originally planned to use it so I could get some hair supplies cause I am almost out, but I needed a mop more.  The idiot land lord told us we needed to get the trash up outside. I went out there and there was no trash to be found.  The other night i heard something rustling around out there and went to see and it was the neighbors damn dog. Which i pretty much already knew, but now I have a visual, lol.  David told him about the neighbors dog and said it was up to us to talk to them about it. But damn...you would think the 480 a month would at least include garbage service.  He's a stingy man.  It wouldn't hurt him to take off the extra 80, with the gas prices being the way they are. But I guess, his rich ass doesn't have a heart. Ok, anyway.  I think I'm gonna clean today and use the new mop...wow the greatest excitment of my life..."

"event","Well David's mom came by with the application yesterday evening. I filled it out while she was here and she is suppose to be taking it back with her this morning. The application was fairly short, which is always a good thing. This is pretty early for me, since I'm used to sleeping until about 9:30-10:00 in the morning. For some reason, Ethan decided to wake up at the asscrack of dawn. I originally wanted to wake up early anyway so I could get a head start on cleaning my house, but I still haven't really woke up yet and that is all I am waiting for. Maybe breakfast will help. He is watching 'A Bug's Life'..such a cute movie. I have to pay my electric bill before 5 today before they turn it off.  That is always lovely. Oh well...at least I can just go to the shallowford location instead of going all the way downtown. I also have to take Ethan to his speech therepy today at 3:30, which is on holtzclaw, which is probably the easist place in chattanooga to get to.  Maybe it's a good thing I got up this early after all...I just I hope I don't get sleepy later.  I found out yesterday that Ethan can start headstart anytime now. It lets out at 2:30 and from that time till 6 is daycare. If I get the job with david's mom...i won't be getting off work until 5:30.  I really don't like the idea of Ethan staying there all day.  That is a really long time for a kid his age. But considering david has been officially kicked out of the elctrical union, he will be able to go get him when school lets out, unless he ends up working for his dad. He can still get his state license all he has to do is take some test and then he can legally get his own business through Parker Electric. Check it out in the new Yellow Pages.  I would just rather someone be able to pick him up at 2:30 as much as possible. Besides my mom can go get him once she gets laid off, which will probably be in october sometime. It will be really hard to drop him off knowing he will be there all day with strangers. Its like, what if he starts looking for us or wants to take a nap?  Who will change his diapers? I'm sure I'm over reacting but...it sucks to be in a big place all alone.  But he loves playing with other kids.  It will be kind of neat though, cause I went to the exact same place when I was about 4.  I just hope he doesn't start crying when one of us goes to leave, cause that will just break my heart.  I remember other kids crying when their parents left. If I don't get the job...I can stay at the school with him. They have some sort of thing there for the parents. Not sure what it is. My body is telling me I need to go back to sleep, but my mind is telling me to stay awake."

"event","Ok...the gas prices are just rediculous. I have heard now that it is up to $2.79 a gallon for the lowest grade.  I had a half tank yesterday and put exactly $16.22 in it and it only filled it up to the ""F"" mark on the gas gauge.  It will go past that when it is completely full.  Almost 20 damn dollars for a half a tank.  To beat all...David is out running around in the damn car, knowing we don't have the money to replace the gas with.  He said he was going out to look for a job then was gonna go to rodney's while he was out.  I call over there and rodney said he went to get some hamburgers.  That really irritates me cause he knows we have no damn money, especially with the rent being due tomorrow. And everytime I have ever wanted to go anywhere I always got...'well we don't have the gas for you to be going over to your mother's.' And rodney lives all the way down in chattanooga, near the airport. It probably doens't take shit to get to my mom's house, if any. Quite honestly...I suspect something fishy is going on.  Cause he now confirmed today that rodney's supposed girlfriend was not only his roomate, but just a 'friend with benefits.'  They all play some stupid video game together, cause that is all he ever talks about when he is on the phone with rodney.  I just find it strange that, the girl gets off work at 7 and I called at 7:30 and he was gone.  It pisses me off that he's out running around town in my fucking car, using my fucking gas. Well fuck that shit. I have to go to a damn wic appointment tomorrow, but he never thinks about those things. I can guarandamntee you, he has ran out at least a half tank of gas. But its ok i guess, considering it is almighty david.  It just pisses me off that he wasn't there when i called. I'm gonna give him shit for it. You wait and see...He should have been back now already."

I used to eat it all the time as a kid, but for some reason my stomach just can't handle it anymore. ::yawns:: It is already noon and I haven't done much of anything. Well I did manage to get some dishes washed, well the dishwasher did. Hey, someone had to load it...Anyway.  David's mom called last night and asked if i would be interested in job at the Diagnostic Center of Chattanooga, where she works, and of course I told her yes. She said they were willing to train someone in the medical records department, or something like that. She's suppose to drop off an application this evening.  She asked if I had a resume...but I have only worked once in my entire life, so how could I even have a resume?  It would be kind of pointless really.  I hope I don't need one, cause I have no clue how to make one. I have a general idea, but thats about it.  I was told in highschool that id its not just perfect, they won't even consider looking at it. If I could get a job down there, that means I'd already have a job in that direction if we do decide to move.  If we decide to separate...I can awlays transfer somewhere else, since I will already have some experience working in a mdeical facility.  You would think so anyway.  I hope I get it.

I'm so bored. There's satellite tv here and there's nothing to watch.  Well...mtv cribs is on and its either that or jackass...and besides, they are going to show a house of some famous MX and SX rider that my brother just admires...so i'm recording it onto the dvr, so he can watch it. He may have already seen it.  Oh well...thats what the delete button is for, right?  I'm drinking a little glass of milk, hoping it will get rid of my heartburn.  I was doing really well with my eating, until this weekend. For some reason, I haven't really had any control over what i ate, hardly at all. I actually lost 6 pounds, but I'm sure I will have gained it back when i weigh myself tomorrow.  Me and JB had a conversation about this on saturday...well technically sunday, anyway.  I'm scared that the way i am eating isn't healthy.  But this is the first time since i have been 'dieting' that i have actually eaten more. I know i have probably said this before but just for the record...it said on my scale that according to my heighth and age, i should weigh like 120.  But since i weigh 150, i am considered morbidly obese.  Whow comes up with this shit. I have seen morbidly obese people...and i look nothing like that. i'm just 30 pounds overweight...why does that have to be considered morbidly obese?  Makes no sense to me. If I could just lose 20 pounds...i would be happy.  Actually, the only time i have been eating last week was...at 12, which was a hot dog...and then supper at 5.  and that is all for the day.  I go to bed starving and wake up starving. It worked as far as losing the weight...but i don't want to starve myself either. At that rate, I lost a pound a day. I'm just tired of feeling fat.

There's like this big ass hole in the cieling of the downstairs and there's no way it can be fixed unless we move out. The hole has already started to drip water after every time the tub drains.  I would love to have been going on my own if I was going to move out...but that just isn't the case. We will have to move together...and I'm gonna have to get a job close to where ever we move.  I just wished I knew someone who had a mobile home for sale, cause it would be so much cheaper then paying $480 a month just to live in the middle of nowhere basically.  I'm going to save every box I can find and start to pack up Ethan's stuff first.  I have gotten to the point right now where I really don't care where I move...cause I know I have to go somewhere other than here. It's really scary to think about moving to a bigger city, but the attitude i'm trying to have right now is, that if it means saving money, then its worth it, especially the way gas prices are right now. It would be a lot easier if you could just drive 15-20 minutes work instead of 45 minutes to an hour.  David said his friend rodney knows someone who has a trailer for sale close to him.  David really wants to check in on it.  I haven't seen the place yet, so I don't know.  The thing is...is that it is right next to the airport in chattanooga.  To me, that is a long ways away.  I couldn't just go anywhere I wanted to anymore. Most of all, I'm scared of never getting to see my friends.  The plan is...is if i can get a job and save my money...I can move out and get my own place.  And I certainly don't want ethan going to any of the schools in chattanooga or a private school.  I want him to go to a place where if something were to happen there would be plenty of people that could easily just go get him.  ::sighs::"

I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. We both know it will end sooner later and I think it would be best if it happened before Ethan gets too much older. I think the number one reason why neither of us can get along, is that we can't be happy with ourselves first. I mean, before I got to this point in my life...there's a lot of things I wanted to do first and I still want to do those things. And it's the same with him.  I just don't think this is the right time for us to be together, if we were even meant to be together at all.  It all depends on how soon I can get myself on my feet. I don't want it to end on negative terms and I think if it did...it would only make things worse. It will be really hard when it comes time for holidays and birthdays.  The past 3-4 years, I've always had someone to spend them with. And I'm sure there will be plenty of times I will wonder what he is doing at a particular time and he will wonder the same about me.  It will hurt for a while. I guess it is better to hurt for a while then to hurt for a lifetime.  I love him, but probably not as much as he loves me.  He told me no matter what happenes or whoever comes a long, that no one would be able to take my place. Ever. I know it seems kind of selfish, but that really makes me feel better.  We just need to go our separate ways and if we are really meant to be together...then it will happen later on. It's just not meant to happen now.  I have been praying long and hard for the strength to deal with all of this and it seems like I'm getting stronger everyday. I really believe god will help me through this and I'm praying he will halp me to make the right decision. I just have to be patient. I would love to try it again in the future, but the thing that scares me...is what if he finds someone who is much prettier and sweeter than me...it would kill me to see him give someone the wedding that I never had. Quite honestly...I don't think I am even meant to be with anyone. But I have been proved that it is possible for someone to truely love me and that gives me some sort of hope.  The best thing I can think of, is to just go my own way, do my own things and god will send the person I'm suppose to be with, whether it be david or not."

If he can't have the least bit of control, then its not going to be good in any direction. But i go through mental abuse everyday. I will tell you now, I am no saint. I admit I scream at him, but i never say anything like, 'i will throw you down the stairs if you don't shut up' Then I think if he really and truly loved me...he wouldn't say those things, especially to the mother if his child. Someone brought to my attention today that I needed to get out, before he really snaps and really hurts me. I just don't see it that way. I guess that is usually the way it goes. Most women would be scared I guess, but I have no fears. I'm not afraid of him in anyway.  Only when I know he's about to do something. Then I have to live with thinking its my fault and that if i had just shut up to begin with, nothing would have happened. He's held me down many times, but there was only that one time he put his hand over my mouth. Isn't one time too many? He said if we got a divorce that i couldn't tell the judge he was aggressive with me cause he wouldn't have any rights to see ethan. So I guess I'm suppose to lie...and make him think that what he did to me was ok.  I know he would never hurt ethan and i don't have any fears that he would do anything to him. I'm just going to sit down with him this evening and ask him if he ever has any intentions of hitting me regardless of the situation. If he says yes to anything, then thats that. I'm not someone who's husband hits them.  If I have to control the fact that I scream...why can't he control his urge to be voilent? I was always afraid of being in this situation."

"event","well over the weekend david went to his friend rodney's house all day saturday and after work on friday. We got into an argument yesterday about something I don't even remember. He said I started yelling at him as soon as I got home for no reason. Like I'm going to waste my air to scream for no reason...anyway, someone calls and david answers the phone, since he was already near it. A minute or so had passed and I got curious to what he was talking about. I assumed he was either talking to rodney or his dad.  I went up stairs and listened in on the speaker phone and some bitch i don't even know was giving him legal advice on how to divorce me and that he didn't deserve to have to put up with me and he was telling her how I started yelling at him when I first came through the door.  When she started running her mouth again thats when I picked up and said "" listen you bitch, as far as i'm concerned its none of your fucking busniess""  It was the simple fact that he was over there for two days in a row talking about our relationship to some complete stranger and to a girl at that.    See, the girl is supposedly rodney's roomate and his girlfriend. I know david wasn't cheating on me or anything like that, its just I feel like he betrayed my feelings. He was saying over and over how she was just a friend. Funny thing is, a couple a days ago, he was only considering her as rodney's roommate. Cause I asked the other day and he was like, ""no, they are only friends."" If i had thought of it I would have thrown that in his face last night. I trust david enough for him not to cheat on me and i know he didn't, but it feels like my feelings were cheated on, if that makes sense.  The thing is, he has always told me he didn't want me to have any guy friends and that I could never be around other guys, unless they were my friend's boyfriends or something. I threw that in his face and then he played the 'i never said you couldn't have guy friends' just because it supported his argument at the moment. Whatever...he calls me a double standard bitch...what about him?  Sure I get on here and talk about our problems, but its not like I will ever have any contact with the people who read this journal. I might even say things to my friends, but at least I know for sure what my friend's intentions are and at least David knows them. It does matter to me if I know them or not. How can that girl even judge me as a person, from everything he's told them?  I guess her opinion doesn't matter, but it seems now I can't even have the benefit of the doubt.  He actually had the nerve to tell me, ""if you ever wanted to be a part of my life, you could get to know my friends.  You could have gone with me to rodney's, but no, you wanted no part of it.""  That is such horseshit. I try to get him to go with me all the time and he doesn't want to. What the fuck am I gonna do, go to rodney's and watch them play video games all fucking day?  thats real entertainment, let me tell ya.  I always ask him to go places with me and he would rather sit here and play this fucking game on the internet. We go to a lot of cookouts over the summer and he would rather stay here couped up in this damn house with a game then be out with me.  At least at those places you would actually be doing something. I guess you could say I was really heartbroken last night to hear him talking to another girl, regardless of what the conversation was. Thats what will make it so hard to get a divorce, cause it would just kill me to see him with another person.  He told me last night, ""you know i love you with all my heart, and you will probably never find another person who will love you like me""   thats really scary, cause i somewhat believe that. And yes, I do have to have someone to make me happy. Its just so confusing, cause here I have someone who really loves me, but yet we just aren't compatible.  This is going to sound really corny, but I have always wanted someone to love me and see past my physical flaws...and I did, but yet its just not meant to be.  Something tells me, I should just not worry about it at all and let god take care of it and if its meant for me than it will happen, but the other part of me says, 'don't be stupid...why would someone want to love you?'  and I know i can never get the nice things I want by doing it on my own.  But you can have all the nice things you want, but what do they really mean if you don't have anyone to share them with?  I'm still going to get a job, so i can get on my own feet. My mom said she would let me put a trailer behind her house, if thats what I really want to do.  It's just I dont' have any credit at all. The best thing I can think of to do is...do my job around here which is to clean house and take care of ethan.  Most importantly, i want to do what is best for him. There's this house down the street from my mom that is really pretty and I would love to have, but I can't get anything without a credit. I guess I could take out a loan.  I really don't know cause, Ethan will have to start pre-school next year and I don't have any idea how he's gonna get there if I'm going to be working. And there's no way in hell I'm letting him ride the bus until he's in the 1st or 2nd grade. His cousin logan will be on there then to kind of help watch him.  I'm so scared the bus will wreck or something while I'm at work.  Whatever I do from now on, its going to be for Ethan and me.  Thats the only way I know how to look at it.  There's cute little birdies outside my window."

"event","Yeah, so um me and ethan went with my mom to the longest yard sale today. It started on Thursday and will last until next weekend. The yard sale really starts at the Kentucky/Illinois line, then ends somewhere in Georgia.  We rode to Dayton where we got breakfast at Hardee's. Then went up Dayton Mountain over to Pikeville. We worked our way back to Dunlap. I actually found quite a few things today and quite cheap might I add. I bought Ethan a keyboard for like $2, it only needs batteries. The people said it worked for sure. I found some chili pepper lights, which I plan to use when we have 'fiesta night' at my house.  That will be fun.  I also found a 4 foot white christmas tree for only a $1!   I plan on using it outside. The chili peppers lights had a short in the cord and the lights wouldn't stay on, so I just took off all the chili peppers and threw the lights away. I thought it was worth a $1 just to get the chili peppers and I can always get another strand of lights that actually work properly. There's 35 chili peppers and I already had a strand of 50 count lights so I just put a pepper on every other light and then plugged them up and I must say, it really looks neat. I have like 5 or 6 peppers left though. Oh well.  My mom bought me a candle, which is called pumpkin spice and it smells just like a freshly cut piece of pumpkin pie. Yum.  I hear it thundering outside, but there's no rain."

"event","Even though Ethan's birthday is in november, I have already been thinking about how to do his party this year. I always got a head start on the past two and it really saves a lot of hassle in the end. If you know what your going to do it in a month or two in advance, you can go ahead and start buying stuff.  I just seem to have the same problem every year which is finding things that are age appropriate. I'm not giving him a big party like I did last year, although I'd really like to.  I don't even know where I will have it either. There's just no room at all here. I actually thought about seeing if David's mom would let me have it at their house, since they have plenty of room, but they are weird about things like that. I thought about renting the lions club...but if its not going to be a big party, then what is really the point? And I don't know if the lions club would be to trashy. I'd have plenty of space though. I don't intend on inviting all the people I did last year, cause its just to much. Usually the more people you have, your gonna have to have food besides cake and ice cream and I seriously doubt we'd be able to feed that many people. Besides I can give him a big party next year. Just roatate it out every other year. I plan on having food this year, I just won't need as much.  I'd like to do his party in Bob the Builder, but thats kind of pointless if there's not going to be other kids there. I'd like to do it in Stuart Little myself, cause that would just be cute. If Ethan could talk, I'd let him decide for himself, but what can you do?  The things he likes now are Stuart Little, Shrek, Barney, Bob the Builder, Blue's Clues...I don't know if he's quite old enough for shrek and to old for Barney, Ugh...I might just rent the church out again if I decide to give him a big party, I really don't know. I might just have it at pizza hut. That sounds like a plan.  Blah..."

"event","I am eating a jimmy dean sausage and cheese croissant and I must say it's pretty darn good. It comes with two pieces of sausage, so I took one off and gave it to Ethan. He loves sausage.  I'm very seriously thinking about exercising today. I really need to.  In fact I need to start walking in the evenings again. I have no problem walking around the block where I live, just I don't want to go alone. You know what is really annoying, is david said after he gets through this apprenticeship thing, he wants to go to school to get an actual degree, which is fine and all, but he said i wouldn't be able to go to school until he is completely done with both. Thats almost 10 or more years from now...i don't want to be going to college at 32.  I know you can go at any age, but i'm not waiting that long. I want to get it out of the way now.  I just don't think its fair that I'd have to wait until his 4 years of his apprentice thing, then another 4 years for regular college. it seems a bit rediculous.  On the other hand and just as an example, if i were to start school this fall, what the hell would I go for?  I could go for an art degree, but i get very intimidated when i see other people's work better than mine, not to mention discouraged.  Of course, I could just do that and after I am done, I could do my own work on the side as a hobby, which would be just awesome. Maybe I could actually sell something of mine, if I could find someone stupid enough to buy it, lol.  I would be fine just taking art classes somewhere, I really have to go to college just to learn certain thing. But I would greatly enjoy an art history course for sure, not to mention a classic rock course, which much to my amazement they actually offer at chattanooga state.  Maybe I could get a degree in computers or something and do the extras on the side? As you can see, I really don't know how all this shit works. Here I am talking about college like I'm actually gonna do something with my life. But if i really wanted to go, i think i could easily get a grant, being that i have a kid and all, or so i hope, because thats the only way i'd be able to pay for it. Ugh...i have already missed 4 years.  I really don't know what I want to do with anything in my life.  Everyone else seems to have an answer, but me."

"event","We made it home last night around 9 something.  Friday we left at 4:30 and drove to The Cheescake Factory in Atlanta and met my cousin there. Oh my God, the food there was soooo good. It's probably the nicest restaurant i have ever eaten in.  Me and mom split an order of the Chicken Littles, which were basically small chicken strips, but there was so much, the plate was just over flowing with them.  And to beat all, they were sooo delicious.  It came with fries which were really good there. To top it all off, we all split a piece of apple caramel cheesecake and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. It was worth the 2 hours we waited in line to get in. We get to my cousin's house and I couldn't believe how small it was, well...it wasn't really small, but too small to be a house really. It was pretty much laid out the same as my apartment, only a little bit bigger. I have more kitchen space though.  We got up the next morning at 6 and left around 7 to go to Savannah.  We stopped at hardee's on the way for breakfast, then we were on our way.  It took maybe 3 hours to get there from Atlanta and it seemed shorter than that. Anyway.  We get into the city of Savannah and oh my gosh...it looks a lot like new orleans, only nicer.  The streets are lined with spanish moss trees and there are horse and caraiges everywhere giving tours of the city.  It's such a beautiful city and full of history might I add. After we check into the HYATT hotel, we drive up the street looking for paula deen's restaurant, Lady and Sons.  All we had to do was, turn one corner, and it was right in our face. It was really easy to find. It was already around 11 AM at this point. We were gonna go ahead and put our names on the list, but they had already stopped taking names for lunch and we would have to come back the next day.  From there, we walked back the way we came and went down this one street that had different little shops and a few restaurants and found BD burgers.   I ordered a BD burger with cheese and onion rings. That was the best cheeseburger I believe I have ever eaten and the onion rings were so good, you could have just made a meal off them by theirself. After this we went back to the room and cooled off a bit, cause it was insanely hot.  We took the elevator from our hotel down to Riverwalk, which is a giant strip of shops and stores of all kinds on both sides.  An area of Riverwalk was made of stones and there was a stone wall. According to my cousin's friend, those stones were brought over there on the ships that used to carry the slaves and they would throw the stones in the bottom of the ship to weigh it down.  At the end of the strip were some more monuments.  One was the olympic torch monument to commemerate the Olympics that were held there for the water rowing portion of the Atlanta Olympics. Another statue I thought was really neat was one of this girl, called ""the waving girl"" who back in the late 1800's would stand there on the grass and wave to the sailors as they were leaving and coming in.  I got a picture of that and the torch.  On the way back up Riverwalk, we walked on the other side and went into the stores over there. We accidentally walked back into one of the shops we had gone into when we first got there and ran into the guy who was signing the books of ""behind the green moss"" or something like that. We were standing there while he was signing some lady's book and he was asking her how long she was staying in town and whatnot, and asked if she watched foodnetwork and ask if she knew who paula deen was. of course she didn't know and my mom was like, ""i know who she is, I watch her every day at 4 o' clock.  My aunt bought one of his books and as he was signing hers, he was giving us all kinds of information about her brother's restuarnat Uncle Bubba's Oyster House, and telling us what times to be there and that paula was there everyday making up her own special plate of the day.  And he told us if we were going to Lady and Sons, to get there at 9:30 in the morning and put our name on the list.  He said if you can catch her at either restaurant, she will sit down with you for pictures, chat, and share recipes.  He was really nice about the whole thing.  We go back to the room and cool off again and at this point it was like 6 something. So we are trying to hurry up and trying to make it to uncle bubba's to see if paula is there. We all got in and was intending on eating there and my cousin asked a waitress if paula was there and of course she said 'no, paula is in new york promoting her new cookbook this weekend' so that blew that out of the water, but it was a neat experience nonetheless.  Everyone decided they didn't really want to eat there anymore, so I come up with the bright idea to go to Tybee Island and maybe find something there to eat. We found this little pizzaria thing once we got there and my cousin said he ate there before and it was good, so....thats where we ate. Despite how nasty the restaurant was....the food was excellent. It was the best calzone I had ever eaten.  Everyone else said their food was the best as well.  After that we turned the corner and walked down towards the beach and stopped at Ben and Jerry's for ice cream. I got Mint chocolate chip...which was awesome. My mom and aunt got cherry garcia, which they just loved. We got to the beach and walked all the way up to the end of this giant pier where people were fishing. We left Tybee Island and went back to the room, to cool off once more. And my aunt got this big bright idea that it would be cool to go on one of the ghost tours at night.  After many times of saying no, I finally got the guts to go. It was either go on the walking tour or go on the tour where you ride in a hearse through the city and i was not about to do that. Besides it was sold out when we called anyway.  We walk to the place that sells the tickets, which was about ablock away and they were only $10, not bad for a 90 minute tour.  So we are on the tour and the guide just stops at several different places where someone was either hung or buried alive. It was really interesting.  This one really old house, which is now a bed and breakfast, used to be a funeral home and the mortuary and embalming room was in the basement of the house. All around the house was a fence laid in marble, except for this one area that had a piece cut out, so they could slide the caskets in and out. The breakfast area of the house now, was where they once had the casket during the funeral service. Weird thing is, while the guy was talking about it...there were people actually staying there. There's no way in hell i'd stay there. The coolest and creepiest place he took us to was this old, OLD  4 level hospital where back in the day they would bring the sailors who were suffering from yellow fever up to the top room where they later died. This building had such an eerie feeling just standing outside of it. I got several pictures of the windows of these places and I'm hoping when I get them developed there might actually be something on there. The tour guide said he gets pics emailed to him all the time from previous people who have gone on the tour who seen things. But the tour wasn't really scary at all. More of a history thing really. It lasted for like 2 hours instead of and hour and a half.  Anyway.  We go back to the room for the rest of the night. The next morning I look at the clock and it was like 9 something. ""Oh shit, we over slept..."" Luckily, my mom was already up and almost ready, so she went down to lady and son's and put our name on the list so we could get in. We pack up all our shit to go home and check out of the hotel.  We walk back down to lady and sons around 11.  We were about the 10th name they called to finally go inside. There are like 3 levels to the restaurant and we were on the 3rd. It was so cool in there after sweating outside. It was sooo pretty in there and the food was out of this world. I got fried chicken, mashed potatoes, creamed corn... it was insanely good. it was well worth the aggrivation of standing in the heat.  It was the probably the best food I have ever eaten.  It is a definite must, especially if you liked southern cooked food, they way they did it in the old days.  We all got dessert to, we had a choice of banana pudding, which i got, chocolate gooey cake, and peach cobbler. We all got something different and just sampled each others. They were all so good. It was the best banana pudding i have ever eaten. it was the best peach cobbler i have ever eaten. and the cake was just oh so good. then we came home."

I Still have to take a bath and fix my hair...but I have to wait on my mom so she can watch ethan. So I'm basically waiting around. I have some clothes in my bag, but I can't put the rest of the stuff in until I am done getting ready.  I took the shirt back that my aunt got me and traded it in for the purple flip flops that i wanted...only had to pay a difference of 11 cents.  They were 2 for $10 to begin with. I have got my dvd's together and I'm taking beetlejuice, the notebook, and 13 going on 30.  I will probably only watch one.  There's not really much to do, besides write about boring shit on here. Mom is wanting to take ethan to see march of the penguins when we get back, but i seriously don't think he will sit down and watch it. That movie looks so cute. I actually want to see the dukes of hazard movie.  I won't be back till sunday evening sometime, I'm sure ya'll we're just dying to know."

"event","there's not really much going on at the moment. I just got done cleaning up my kitchen. I even mopped. I started once or twice to not doing it, but I just made myself do it.  I'm taking a break as we speak, then it will be off to cleaning the living room...oh joy.  Actually, I have been doing some things to get ready for this week end such as laundry and deciding on what to wear. My mom bought me this really cute shirt at goody's the other day for like $4.   My aunt bought me a shirt to, but it looks terrible on me, and even if it did fit the way i wanted it, the shirt is just hideous, no offense to her.  She told mom that i could take it back for something else, which I fully intend on doing. I might just put it towards a pair of sandals i saw there once, and they might even already be marked down again.  The first night (tomorrow) we are suppose to go out to eat at some restaurant in atlanta and I can't decide if I want to go ahead and get ready before I leave my house, since its only going to take a couple of hours to get there anyway. I won't even have to do anything once I get there, however I want to be comfortable on the ride down. I'm not even sure what pants I am wearing yet. If I wear shorts, it might be freezing in the restaurant.  I could just wear shorts on the way down and change into my pants once I get there. That sounds like a plan.  Last night I was digging in my closet upstairs for my bathing suit and found like a brand new pair of shorts i had bought at old navy last year. I had forgotten they had even existed. Talk about a natural high ;)  So I have 2 pairs of shorts and a pair of capri's to take with me. Not bad I guess.  Just...I never did find my bathing suit. Thats always lovely.  I think me and mom are gonna go look at wal-mart and see if they don't have any marked down.  I have a pair of board shorts, but what would I wear with them?  We aren't even going to the ocean to swim, just to stroll on the beach for a while. But we will mostly be shopping I guess.  I have yet to try on my new jeans again, I'm just gonna wait until tomorrow. I'm debating on whether or not to paint my toenails. ::sighs::  I have decided to take my dvd player, but now I can't decide on what dvd's to take. I will probably just listen to cd's on the first ride down.  There was a gecko on my house the other day. creepy."

"event","i just got off the phone with the people at my doctor's office and they said my x-rays came back normal.  The only thing left i could think of that is wrong with me is either my kidneys or my gall bladder.  For as long as this has been going on, you would think if it was my gall bladder it would have ruptured or something by now. I have been treating the situation as if it were kidney stones and it seems to work. I just need a medical diagnosis.  Now days you don't ever know what could be wrong. A lot of people just go in for a check up not complaining of anything, then they find out the only have a few months to live.
""Time is a precious thing, never waste it""
I tried to tell my doctor that it wasn't my actual back that was hurting, it was my sides in the back.  Well at least I know i don't have scoliosis, which runs on my dad's side of the family.  I have been doing pretty good with eating so far this week. I know, its only wednesday.  But, I have been eating only twice a day. I pretty much starve myself up until lunch, then eat dinner later on. I go to bed hungry and wake up hungry.  I'm trying to get what few decent clothes I have washed up for this weekend.  I still don't even know if david's mom will even watch him this weekend. I plan to call her tonight and see if she's not busy.  I will be highly disappointed if she says no, but there's not really anything I can do, but take him with me, and thats like begging to be a nervous wreck.  The whole point of me even going is so i can get away from everything, even if its just for 2 days.   I'm debating on whether or not to take my cd player.  The first ride down will only be a couple of hours, so it really wouldn't be worth fooling with. Just, the next day will be another 4-5 hours... I don't know if I can live without music that long. I'm sure my aunt will play the radio, but i do NOT want to hear gospel the whole way down there or the soundtrack to phantom of the opera.  Anyway...I figured I could take our portable dvd player, so not only could I watch a move if i wanted, but it doubles as a cd player as well, so...  I think that will be my best bet. I wished I had a small cd holder thing, the one i have holds like 40 something and thats not even half my collection. I just want to take a few of them. One's I know for sure I will listen to.  Let's see...both of my cure cd's, the bravery, and maybe even johnny cash. You gotta have some variety.  My stomach hurts.  Of course ethan ran out of diapers last night so i had to go to wal mart at like 9 and once i got there they were out of the size he needed, so i had to get him some of another brand...i got to the car opened them up so i could put one on him, turns out they were potty training pants. I forgot to get them out of the car last night and david had to go to work this morning. Ugh...can't i ever do anything right? So my mom was going to dayton anyway, she said she would just pick him up a pack of something... and she was bringing us something back for lunch, which at this point i could 'eat the legs off that chair'   I'm holding back, I can do it...maybe."

"event","ethan had his speech evaluation today at the speech and hearing center in chattanooga. Turns out he's gonna need speech therepy for a year, and he's gonna have to be preschooled once he's old enough.  They want him to start early so he can inter act with other children, which will help his speech tremendously.  David asked them if he might be autistic, and from their point of view they said they seriously thought he was fine, but of course they aren't the ones to determine that. So lets see, his pediatrician says he's fine, the pathologist says he's fine...are you with me so far? it's so funny, cause his family will give me a hard time about getting him appointments and shit, but yet they don't want to help get him to them. Anyway.  You can't tell them anything. It's better to just prove them wrong so they will leave me alone about it. The cool thing about the speech therepy is that, tenncare covers all of it for as long as he needs to go, which is good. I have to take him back on monday to have a hearing test done. The lady says she thinks his hearing is fine, they are just suppose to do the hearing test first, just to make sure.  I'm bored."

"event","Things have been a lot calmer around here the past few days.  Jb is suppose to be coming over either today or tomorrow, I dont remember which. I think she said Monday. I'm pretty sure it was Monday.  I have a lot of things I need to do before she comes, like straighten up my house and whatnot.  Me and my mom are going with my aunt this friday to stay with my cousin who lives in atlanta, then the next morning we are getting up and going to savannah, ga and staying at Tybee island. It should be fun I guess. I asked david last night if he mind if I went and it was no problem at all, which was very shocking.  He's going to watch ethan on friday and I'm gonna see if i can't get david's mom to keep him on saturday night and I will be back on sunday evening I think.  The only thing that sucks is I don't even have two dimes to rub together, but my mom said it wouldn't be a problem and she really wants me to go. I'm really excited cause while we are in savannah, we're suppose to visit food network's Paula Deen's Lady and Son's Restaurant.  I love watching her when I get the chance.  Mom bought me some of the neatest capri's at goody's the other day. They are so comfortable, despite the fact they feel a bit loose.  They are blue jean/stretchy material.  Actually, they are made from duck head and the original price was like $42, but I got them for $13.  Not bad I guess.  I guess she figured I needed a few new things before this weekend.  It's really sad, i had been wearing this one pair of jeans like everyday, cause they were the only ones that fit.  I have a brand new pair of jeans upstairs I just can't wear them cause my ass is too big right now. I have pretty much gained back everything I lost. I was doing good up until july 4th, then just lost it from there. I'm gonna see if I can't make any progress from now until the end of the week. I'm hungry now but there's not really anything to eat for breakfast. The place we are staying the second night will have a pool, which will be awesome for some exercise.  I remember when I was younger and we had a pool, I weighed hardly anything, simply cause I spent the entire summer swimming.  Now I pretty much just don't care anymore and eat whatever I want.  There's this really cure Blondie shirt at wal mart that i soooooo want. They actually have band tee's there now, which is a big shocker, after all it is wal mart. some of the others they had were, pink floyd, kiss, ac/dc, the rolling stones, and of course blondie, which is just awesome. The best part is they are at your everyday low wal-mart price of $9.48  I need to go turn in my application to the hospital today, if I can remember to take it. I had to make a special trip all the way up there just to do that, but if it means getting a job...  Gosh, I don't even remember where my bathing suit is...or better yet, if it even fits.  This is what makes me want to lose weight.  ugh... i'm so disgusting."

"event","ok, so i was suppose to have the x-rays and bloodwork done yesterday. Well we ended up not going, just because we didn't feel like it. But I am up for it today. I just want to get it over with while I still have insurance. I need to call about tenncare sometime today and see if I can't get an extension cause I have to go back to my doctor in two weeks and the insurance will be over by then.  Gotta do something. Ok, this is totally weird, but the kitchen light is on and like it keeps dimming for some reason. I think there are spirits around...Didn't start doing it till like 5 minutes ago maybe. While I'm up there today, I'm gonna see if I can't get a job in the emergency room.  I got to have something. I'm tired of sitting here with no money.  David can watch ethan for all i care, cause it doesn't look like he's going to be working anytime soon.  As if that was a surprise.   I'd like to get a job at wal mart, but jeez, it takes like 5 hours to complete their application.  Then its only good for 90 days, then you have to fill it out again after that. It's boring around here, as usual.  I think I have been suffering from post-partum depression all this time..."

"event","so i went to the doctor yesterday to talk to him about my ""kidneys"" and told him every single symptom i had, then he tells me I could have scoliosis?   That makes absolutely no sense to me, but he's a doctor so I guess he would know more than me. He told me I had to go get some back x-rays and some blood work done. I did blood work before for the same exact thing and everything came back negative, so why should I even bother doing the blood work again?  I definitely need a back x-ray cause I have this hump on the top part of my spine.  My mom had to get x-rays on her back yesterday at rhea county hospital, then my dr's appointment was afterwards.  She was suppose to get blood work done yesterday as well, but someone there misread the instructions. So were going back today.  I'm just going to give them the paper and tell them I'm there to have an x-ray on my back.  Maybe I can skip the whole blood work procedure. I just hate needles. It's funny cause, I have gone up there before complaining of my kidneys and they did x-rays and drew blood and as I said earlier, everything was normal.  Besides I haven't had any symptoms for over 3 weeks now. And how do you explain me having pains after drinking a regular coke?  If I had scoliosis, then why do I almost always puke whenever I get the pains? I have never heard of back pain making you puke.  Of course, having a curve in your spine could mean my organs are being smooshed together. I don't know. I also told him about my chronic heartburn and he prescribed me some tagament, which I take every 12 hours, which is excellent instead of taking something when I get the heartburn. With the tagament I could get it all in one wack, lol...wack.  Anyway. ::sighs::  I have some clothes drying in the dryer, I have to wait for them to dry so I can get ready to go back up there ::rolls eyes::  I'm so nervous about the bloodwork. I know I there's nothing in my blood, just I don't want to get stuck. :(    
I have been thinking very seriously after I get a job, to just get me a repossessed trailer and putting it behind my mom's.  I'm sure she would help me out.  She already told me she would help me pay my bills here, but she's not going to do it when there's a grown man here to do that when its his place to begin with. I don't blame her either.  Ugh...  There's so much on my mind right now. my chin is so sore from the other day.  I need to get out."

"event","well it was a very interesting morning, i guess you could say.  me and david were suppose to take ethan to his speech evaluation today, but of course, david's sorry ass didn't wake up. He got me up at 6:30, waited till I got ready, then decides to tell me he's not going with me cause he is too sleepy.  I was soooooo pissed. Still am.  He then looks at me and asks if i am going to take him anyway.  I basically told him how it was that it wasn't fair for me to take him down there and chase him all over the building by myself while his ass is at home asleep on the couch, cause he didn't go to bed till almost 2 this morning, he was up playing some stupid game.  I told him that if he's not going with me then i'm not going either. So we called and re-scheduled after many minutes of contiplating sp*.   I was so angry that i told him i was tired of his shit and that i was leaving. He first pushed me against the coat rack and held me down by my wrists then proceeded to grab me and push me backwards onto the couch.  He put all his weight on me so i couldn't move and covered my nose and mouth with one hand, so it was hard for me to breathe.  he told me he would let me breathe if i stopped screaming at him.  He did that twice.  I told him that was the last time he put his hands on me and i started gathering up all my shit.   after i had calmed down, we sat there and talked and i have decided to stay there until i can get a job and support myself and i can get my own place,  however long that will take.  I know i won't be able to do it alone and i certainly don't want to move back in with my mother. I will probably get a job sometime in the future hopefully and if david gets called back to work, he can get the piece of white shit in the driveway. I told him i would give him joint custody of ethan when the time comes.  I just want to do the right thing here. We just can't get along, and we have pretty much driven each other insane because of it.  As soon as I can be independent, I will be gone for good.  He was so afraid i wasn't going to let him ever see ethan again. I wasn't even about to do that, cause whether I like it or not, that is his dad.  I wasn't about to take that away from him."

"event","ok we went to see charlie and the chocolate factory last night, and have you ever seen one of those movies that start out really good, then it just progressively gets worse?  Thats the way this one was. It would have been a great movie minus the stupid oompa loompa dances. If I had to rate this film, I would give it two thumbs down.  ebert and roeper gave it two thumbs up...i don't know why.  I know the movie was going to be a little corny, but this was just irritating.  Willy Wonka in the original movie is eccentric, but they just went overboard with this new one. Of course, the one we saw last night was more true to the book than the origianl movie.  I just think the original is way better, but thats just me.  I can't believe I waited all year for that movie to come out and then I had to pay almost $8 just to see it. This is probably Tim Burton's worst movie yet, sadly to say.  I bet it didn't make shit at the box office.  I did get to see a preview for his upcoming film, ""Corpse Bride"" which I am just dying to see. It's another claymation actually. It looks really good.  Anyway."

"event","A lecturer, when explaining stress management to an audience, raised a
glass of water and asked, ""how heavy is this glass of water?"" Answers called
out ranged from 20g to 500g. The lecturer replied, ""The absolute weight doesn't
matter. It depends on how long you try to hold it. ""If I hold it for a minute, that's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you'll have to call an ambulance. In each case, it's the same weight, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes."" He continued, ""And that's the way it is with stress management. If we
carry our burdens all the time, sooner or later, as the burden becomes increasingly heavy, we won't be able to carry on. As with the glass of water, you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again. When we're refreshed, we can carry on with the burden. ""So before you return home tonight, put the burden of work down. Don't carry it home. You can pick it up tomorrow. Whatever burdens you're carrying now, let them down for a moment if you can."" ""Relax; pick them up later after you've rested. Life is short. Enjoy it!""
And then he shared some ways of dealing with the burdens of life:

* Accept that some days you're the pigeon, and some days you're the statue.
* Always keep your words soft and sweet, just in case you have to eat them.
* Always read stuff that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.
* Drive carefully. It's not only cars that can be recalled by their maker.
* If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.
* If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.
* It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to others.
* Never buy a car you can't push.
* Never put both feet in your mouth at the same time, because then you won't have a leg to stand on.
* Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.
* Since it's the early worm that gets eaten by the bird, sleep late.
* The second mouse gets the cheese.
* When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.
* Birthdays are good for you. The more you have, the longer you live.
* You may be only one person in the world, but to one person you may be the world.
* Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.
* We could learn a lot from crayons. Some are sharp, some are pretty and some are dull. Some have weird names, and all are different colors, but they all have to live in the same box.
* A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour."

"event","omg......we had the most awesome and creepy time yesterday when we went to see ocean's twelve

me, kerri and rotenko decided that we were gonna go see oceans twelve at the mall on friday...kerri checks the bus schedule and the bus is supposed to leave busch at 6:30...so we go eat dinner and then wait for the bus...so 6:30 comes and goes and then 7:00 comes and goes and still no bus...so while we are waiting in the freezing cold with our limbs falling off, this kid from our floor comes and starts talking to ua...he was supposed to meet his sister at the mall and he was waiting for the bus too...so he calls his sister and she comes with her boyfriend to pick him up and she gives us a ride too....
so we get to the mall and we missed the 7:30 show we were planning to see so we ended up just walking around the mall until the 9:30 show...at around 11:45, kerri makes us leave the movie five minutes before its over because the last bus to rutgers was supposed to leave at 12:00...so we leave and we're running through a mysteriously vacant parking lot, like someone was chasing us, to get to where the bus was supposed to be....so we're waiting and we were the only ones standing there at 12:00 and there was no bus...so tenko calls her brother and he says that the last bus leaves at 12:30 not at 12...so we wait inside until 12:30 and we are the only ones except for this one weird guy who tells us that he doesn't think the bus is coming and leaves after a while to go catch a cab...we start thinking that we should either walk laps around the mall until it opens, fall asleep in the mall, hang out in a cvs or walk back to busch...so we wait inside until a security guard starts locking us inside...she tells us to go through the mall to the cinema entrance because that doors always open...
so we're walking through this deserted mall and eerie christmas music was playing in the background (the first noel) and tenko says she has to pee...so we walk to the womens bathroom to find that someone was cleaning it...so we figured that the mall was closed and no one will ever find us here, so we go into the mens room, which smelled so bad...after that we make our way upstairs, and we get on an escalator and kerri reminds us that in horror movies when you go upstairs, you don't come back down alive...keeping this in mind...we walk towards the movie theatre entrance and wait outside for another hour until a cab came, during which we froze our asses off...so the cab comes up and this scary looking lady is driving and smoking the most toxic cigarette of all time with the windows closed except for one which was only cracked a little...she took every back road possible to get back to busch and every time she made a sharp turn, there was this loud thudding noise coming from the trunk and we were convinced that there were dead bodies in there...so we finally get back to busch reeking of cigarette smoke and we sat in tenko's room and.....yeah the end

we should turn this into a horror movie...seriously it felt like we were thrown into one

weird ass night, all just to see oceans twelve...which was a very good movie...i highly recommend you go download it"

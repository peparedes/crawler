Okay, so I'm stupid.

It's taking me about that long, and longer, to write Elemental.  Part of my world building included writing a novella.

Sure, a LOT has happened in that time, but if I can make this a full time career at some point I won't be able to make excuses.

Okay, not dire.  Not yet.  But if I don't get one, the living situation is going to get mighty uncomfortable starting next month or the month after, because my hours are being completely slashed.  I'm very unhappy about that.

But...because of it I've been writing like a woman possessed.

It's not entirely practical, though.  I might be hiding my head in the sand a bit, not finishing up my resume and sending it out to all sorts of places that will add a commute and the inconvenience of not working at home.  I know this.  I'm aware.  I'm also rather insecure about the interview process in general.

However, I want to finish my second draft of Elemental.  I want this chance.  I want to take this risk.  I love this novel, and I want to play in this world for years to come.  I want to write.

"event","The wedding threw me off my writing groove.  I'd been reading all of these books 'n stuff...and then a week ago I just had this urge to drop it all off a cliff.  =P  I've wanted to write, but I have this regular schedule now, and it's all days with weekends off.  ZOMG!  So, all the time I'd normally be writing while the boys are at work/school is taken up with...work.  And dammit, I'm a newlywed!  I don't want to get lost on the computer while my husband is home.

Anyway, I ended up rereading CCS...I picked up the Dark Horse omnibus editions but never got around to reading the whole thing.  And that got me thinking of old fanfics...

And last week I just sat around and reread old fics I've written.  Finished ones.  And...they're still good.  Not GREAT or anything, but very much worth the read.  Kinda fun if not too involved or convoluted.  Interesting twists, fast paced, etc...

Well, that made me want to go back and reread other things I've loved.  Last night I finished rereading The Labyrinth by Peacewish.  Oh, I had forgotten just how good that one was.  In fact, I don't think I stopped and appreciated all the detail she put into her stories before.  I am a HORRIBLE person, and I used to have this terrible habit of skimming or skipping large blocks of text...and I was guilty of that in too many of her stories.  And what I found this read through was GLORIOUS!  What a treat.  :D

I really need to finish Zettai Daijobu.  Like...now.  Before I keep adding large blocks of text to Elemental.  I owe Peacewish, and any other fans who have patiently waited for that fic.  And anyone who will find it only after it is finished.  The chapters are so short and easy, from my current perspective.  I have NOTES!  (Seriously, this fic was a huge turning point for me.  Planning and I never used to mix.  At all.  Ever.)  (We're talking oil and water.  For reals.)

So, yeah.  I can do this.  I WILL do this.  And I will finish it and put it out on LJ for folks, and then ff.n and maybe Tsukimine Shrine, and...this will be a good thing.  This fic and Riding the Wave have been hanging off my back, holding me back, dragging me...I will finish them.

And then revisions on Elemental will be a piece of cake."

Well, I suppose I'm getting better at pretending.  I know the right things to say these days, more often than I used to.  I still feel like I'm broken inside.

I read <a href=""http://www.danoah.com/2013/02/pulled-from-the-truth-box-week-10.html"" target=""_blank"">this post</a> of Single Dad Laughing today.  I'm falling apart all over again.  I don't have secrets like that, I wear it all pretty much on my sleeve, but the things others keep secret are things I feel, too.  I just have no shame, I guess.

This whole approaching wedding thing actually has me depressed, off and on.  Not about the wedding or the marriage, though that *does* terrify me in ways that are hard to explain.  (After 38 years of not being good enough for anyone, I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Good things just don't *happen* to me without some horrible cost.)  I think mostly it's the stress piling up, because that's a thing, right?

I've been telling everyone that I haven't been writing/editing because of the looming wedding.  Honestly, I started looking at agent websites and just about crumbled under the weight of not being good enough.  Even if I win the cosmic lottery and get one story, one novel, one *something* published, how could I ever hope to keep it up?  My book will sit on the bottom shelf, picked up by a handful of people who already know my fanfic if I'm lucky and they'd still give me a shot, and then...nothing.

I'm supposed to have it all together by now.  I keep saying, ""This year is the year.""  I've been saying that for so long it's obviously just a hollow shell now.  A brittle mask that hides the fact that there's just not enough substance inside to hold it up much longer.  I can't even get my best friends to stay interested in my novels long enough to read them.  I can't convince any boyfriend I've ever had to even give what I've written a try.

The second chapter is looming over me, staring at me and taunting me, telling me to just give up and play video games because I'll never be a good enough writer to make that chapter worth reading.

And then there's book 2 in the Lightbringer series that came out today.  Delivered straight to my Kindle.  And it's taunting me even worse, telling me I could just sit back and read all day instead of working on my own stories.

Dammit, I've been reading for the last two months.  I need to stop that long enough to get some writing done or I'll never be a success!

This chapter is hard.  And it sucks.  And editing/revising/rewriting is taking so much time that I'm wondering if it's even worth it to try to get published.  And why am I working on Elemental when it's probably the least likely to get published?  Oh, sure, I love it, but it's first person, and it's...flawed.  There are...things.  Things that are wrong with it.  And there's gender issues and sexual identity issues that are never fully resolved.

(Anakin is not entirely keen on the idea, but he's not exactly protesting either.  It's all a bit much for him, and he's got some concerns, but he also wants me to be happy, and I can tell he really likes the idea of being a part of Richard's family except for one small problem...he's got a small crush on the one girl who will become his cousin.  hehe)  

Then he asked my dad's permission, which apparently completely tickled my dad because nobody ever asked him before.  Or even took his opinion into account.

Then, since my parents are divorced, he called my mom.

Then, because my mom isn't nearly all that mature or responsible, he called my sister.

And, of course, he called his own son.

Then my brother, because my sis-in-law was feeling left out.

Followed by <lj user = ""umilingual""> because she's an ex-roommate of both of ours, one of my best friends, and someone we both love and respect a lot.

And then his best friend, Moose.

I called his mom after that, not entirely sure what to say to her because he technically hadn't asked *me* yet.  But since he was calling everyone under the sun, it didn't seem fair that I didn't call anyone.

And he still hasn't asked me.  Technically.  Later that night, he asked me a couple of times, ""So, how do you feel about it?""  And I gave playful, somewhat avoiding answers, because holy shit I was scared.

Terrified, really.

But that's okay.  So was he.  Even if he didn't act like it.  I know him well enough now.

Tuesday we went out and bought rings.  My engagement ring should be sized by next Wednesday.  There will be pics on Facebook.

We have a tentative date.  It's nerdy, so I hope I'll remember it.  We are thinking about having it in Las Vegas, to make it easier for people who will have to travel from other parts of the country.  We have our invitations narrowed down to a handful.  We wrote our first list of people to invite, and then we'll take those lists to our parents to fill in the blanks like great-uncles or great-aunts who might want to at least send gifts.

He called me Mrs. last night in an intimate moment, and while I protested that it's not yet, it was still a huge turn-on.

So...he still hasn't asked me, yet.  Not really.  And I still haven't given him an answer yet.

It's easy to sit there and let it all scroll past and share just that little tidbit that matters, or doesn't matter, or that word of wisdom you found at the bottom of your last bottle of beer.

When I sit down to write, and have time to do so, I try to put the energy into storytelling.  When I have a random thought, it ends up in story notes, or up on Facebook.


Anywho, I had breakfast with my step-mom today.  There's some evil badness there from my past, and from being a pretty messed-up teenager while my dad was dating and then married to someone not really ready to handle any of that.  We really haven't gotten along well, and sometimes in a spectacular manner.  Today went really well, though.  Today I genuinely liked hanging out with her, and I think I'd like to do that again.  I'm starting to understand her better, and that helps a lot.  I think there are a few times I'd like to go back in time and smack the person I used to be, so I don't blame her so much for having such a hard time.  We were raised *weird* when I was little...so...

Eh.  It's a minor miracle I ended up not killing myself as a teenager, between the depression and the abuse.  If I can wind up somewhere closer to normal, and at least able to function in society, it's a huge victory.  I'll take that.

I'll always be weird.  I just hope that it's not a *harmful* sort of weird.  Or, at least one that Anakin can recover from, eventually.  x_x  And one that doesn't wind up with me being found a week later under a pile of crap I've ""collected"", being devoured by my 72 cats.

Yikes.



Setting that thought aside, we're going to try to head up north tomorrow to see snow.  There was a storm last weekend, and apparently most of the snow melted this week, but we're not sure when we'll get another chance.  Some snowy goodness is better than none at all.  The weather just doesn't like my work schedule.  That's all.

I still don't think it will ever be published, but I know a few people who would love to get some more background for Elemental...or just more story, period.

On that note, I think I've rambled enough.  Work tonight is going to be insane, I'm sure.  Some of the clients we have on my shift cater to party animals, so I'm going to need to put in as much relaxing as I can before it starts!  Ciao for now!"

My first question was, ""What are you in trouble for this time?""

He quickly explained that it wasn't anything like that.  He started to go off on a rant about two other kids on the way home from school, and I grew irritated that he doesn't know how to get along with other kids.  As an only child, he can be a little overbearing and demanding, and still has problems compromising with others.

No, it wasn't anything like that.  He calmed down and explained that the two boys were picking on another, smaller, kid while they were walking home from school.  He yelled at them, stood up for the smaller kid, and they started picking on him for it.

Anakin didn't back down.  He didn't act afraid.  So they rode off on their bikes to taunt the smaller kid again, this time trying to get physical.  And Anakin said he glowered at them, rushing toward them to help the smaller kid out.

The bullies rode away, because he stood up to them.  He wasn't afraid of them.  He knew they had no interest in a fair fight.

I want to get the mythology behind Elemental written, and then I'm really going to have to just force myself to finally make a map.  World building is awesome and fun, but it's been a little bit daunting to realize that all the writing I've done the past five years has been world building for a larger story.  I suspected it three years ago, and that's what contributed to the long writing hiatus on Elemental, but enough people have read it and agree with my assessment that it's official now.

Damn what a GOOD bit of world building!

Okay, that aside, I've been getting a little bit of editing in here and there, but I've taken a bit of a break to read a few things by <lj user=""knkfics""> the last week or so.  Their writing always fills me with ideas and inspires me to write more, so in the long run it will balance out.

In other news, Anakin is taking piano lessons.  I mentioned it on Facebook, but I'm just so proud that I felt the need to post it again for another set of peeps...and to have a more permanent place to note it, so when I go back in a few years and look again I can remember it with a fond smile.  When I was little, we could never afford anything like that, and for the longest time in his life we still couldn't.  Now I'm trying to make sure we can.  It's a weird feeling, because I never even thought about things like after school activities being a part of my life or the life of my kid.  Now I can, and it's a good feeling to be able to encourage him like this.  I can't even begin to explain it.

Things are going well with The Evil Redhead.  We're both pretty nonconfrontational, which is a bit of a strain at times, but it's making me come out of my shell and resolve things more often.  We're both still learning how to deal with each other, and I *think* we're both growing from the experience.  Well, I know I am.  If he is or not is up to him.  hehe  Most of the time things are just...good.  I like good.  Good is a nice change.  :D

Finally, I picked up a nice cold from the public germ farm Anakin goes to every week day.  As TER said today, at least it won't interfere with our camping trip.  I'm looking forward to it SO much.  I'm not the outdoorsy type, I'll admit it.  Still, I enjoy camping anyway.  Getting away, experiencing new things, getting dirty and not caring, sitting at the campfire, relaxing in a tent, sitting in the middle of nature...wonderful.  Just wonderful.  I just don't get how anyone would not enjoy camping every once in a while.  So, yeah, glad I'll be over this cold before we go camping.  :D"

"event","...and I mostly watched anime in my spare time the last few days.  I finished both Negima and Princess Tutu.  They were both really good, and Princess Tutu gave me a few things to think about as far as writing goes.  I think I might be ready to tackle the end of Elemental, now.

There are some stories that inspire you to ""fix"" them, either through fanfic or by making a similar situation in your own world and going from there.  There are some stories that inspire you to expand them by writing side stories and fanfic about characters that just didn't get the time they deserved.  And then there are stories that inspire you to find your own story and just run with it.  I'm not sure yet if Princess Tutu is the first or the last for me, but it's one of those two.  The last two episodes made me really itch to start writing.  Immediately.

I hope the feeling carries on.  So, here's to our muses, wherever they're hiding.  :D"

"event","I'm tired today.  No, not sleepy.  I couldn't go back to sleep if I tried.

Just tired.  Weary, I suppose.

A few days ago my aunt asked if she could read Elemental when I was finished writing, before I get around to editing.

No, not my cool professor aunt who is married to a Jewish man and is very open-minded and exposed to a lot of really cool ideas all the time and made an antibiotic strain of flesh-eating bacteria a few summers ago.  (Destroyed at the end of the class, of course.)

My other aunt.

The waitress who lives in southern Idaho and is, as of late, a very devout follower of the LDS church.  She reads crime novels, mystery, suspense, and romance.  Sure, she was raised in California, and before she got married a second time she lived a VERY wild lifestyle.  She's always been very cool and very fun, and always very pretty.

I just don't know how she'll react to this story.

See, the main character in Elemental has a very fluid and flexible gender identity and sexual orientation.  

The majority of LDS people are struggling against accepting those sorts of concepts, as I'm sure most people who read this will know.  I grew up Mormon, until I was nine years old.  I went back a few times, until I prayed about it and realized that the way the church is right now, I can't be a part of it.  While I was Mormon I felt constantly drained and pulled apart.  When I realized I was bi in high school I was not going to any church, but when I went back to the LDS church afterward it was very hard.

I suffered from depression.  The LDS church added to that depression, because I could not pray away my attraction to women no matter how hard I tried, and how much I believed.

That will always be the biggest thing I took away from going to that church.  The times I flirted with suicide because I wanted to kiss my best friend.  The times in my first semester of college that I thought if I wrote my suicide note eloquently enough, that would show them.  That they would suffer as I was suffering.  That their inability to accept me for who I was would be driven home if I could only bring myself to die to let them know.

A few years ago my mom's second cousin killed himself because he was gay and Mormon.  She reminded me of that when I told her I wasn't sure if I should show Elemental to my aunt.  On top of that there were rumors that my mom's cousin, who was like a second mother to me when I was little, may have been a lesbian.  She never got married, and she had a roommate for years that may or may not have been her girlfriend.  I can't ask her about it, because she's dead now as well.

But maybe, maybe, maybe it will have been enough that my aunt can read my novel with an open mind.  I know my family loves me, no matter what my choices have been.  I know my family loves me, and that they are proud of me, and that they want me to succeed.  They're amazing people, full of spirit and faith, even if I just can't agree with the particular church they have put their faith in.

I'll send her a copy when I'm done and I suppose I'll just have to wait and see.  There's a lot of fear wrapped up around this, but I suppose since I write about non-traditional relationships all the time they're (the Mormon half of my family) bound to find out eventually, and I just have to trust them to make up their own minds."

I didn't expect a lot in the way of feedback on my fanfic chapters, <strike>but I'm still a bit sad that I didn't get anything at all.</strike>  I brought it on myself, though.

Actually, I *really* want to work on the ending of Riding the Wave right now.  Maybe I'll do that over the next couple of days.  It's such a fun story, and I'd hate to see it unfinished.

That might be one thing that's got me holding back right now.  Fanfic.  I noticed that one friend of mine who is professionally published right now pulled all of her fanfics from all fanfic archives.  I have no idea if she did that before or after she got an agent.  No idea if she did that in a fit of depression (when she deleted her LJ, too) or if it was because as a professional she couldn't have any of it up anymore.

I don't want to pull all of my fanfics.  I know I don't get the readers I used to, because I was inactive so long, but I know I still have people reading.  I don't want to disappoint the people who enjoyed those stories.  Writing isn't about money for me.  It's about sharing my ideas.  It would be *nice* to be able to make a living from it some day, but that's not what would drive me.  I write because I have stories in my head that want to be told.

So maybe that's it.  Maybe that's something that's been holding me back.  Maybe I'm a little afraid of success, because that means I'll have new limits.  I don't know.  I'll think about it.

eta:  Okay, I stuck my foot in my mouth.  I did get feedback on Zettai Daijobu, I just didn't check the right email account before I posted this.  I *do* feel better.  I feel bad about Riding the Wave, but I feel worlds better about writing in general.  Though...the part about what's holding me back on Elemental right now still stands."

I think it will run another 15k-20k words, and I want to flesh out a few things once I'm done putting the story down ""on paper"".  I need to finish writing down what all the holidays are, and maybe draw a map because the one in my head is still a little fuzzy.

I know what will happen at the end.  I mostly know how to get everyone from point A to point B at this point, but I've still got a few hazy areas.

I love this story.  I can't wait 'till it's in the shape of a book I'd love to read.  It's close.  But it's not there yet.

Friday was the boyfriend's birthday.  We went on a road trip, which was a lot of fun.  It gave me a few ideas for other novels, especially the Fae ones.  Jalireth grew up in Tucson after he turned 9, and driving around Arizona gives me a feel for what he'd have seen better than sitting in my air conditioned apartment in the middle of the city does.  One thing about writing: you can't write if all you do is sit behind a desk and stare at a computer.  If you don't engage your own five senses, how can you make your reader feel like all five of theirs are engaged?  =P

We've got clouds rolling in.  It might storm tonight.  It might not.  It would be really cool if it does.

"event","For years Elemental has been my baby.  I love the story and the characters in it far more than anything else I've ever written, even after all this time.  I want it to work, but the last chapter I wrote for it was painful.  It hit while my ten-year relationship with Anakin's dad was grinding to a devastating halt, and the desert setting hauntingly reflected my emotional state at the time.

I toyed with scrapping the whole project after how stilted and choppy the last chapter was, especially after one of my best friends pointed out how Agrad was frustratingly complacent and never initiated anything.  Instead he just reacts to everything going on around him, much like I was afraid to take any actions in my own situation at the time.  I felt like my main character had betrayed me, and I needed to write from another point of view to salvage the story and the world I was still so in love with.

It didn't work.  I was relating events in detail that aren't interesting until you know the story.  It sucked the life out of what I'd written before, and when I went back to look at it again it was choppy and left out details that could have made the world come to life.

The last three days I've been rereading the original first-person narrative I started so long ago, and I realized that it's still good.  It's in need of a LOT of editing, but I can salvage this.  It's not as bad as I was afraid it was, if I can just let go of some of the ideas I had of who Agrad is based on how I wanted to see myself at the time, and what I thought a sympathetic character would be.  So I'm rolling up my sleeves and writing like I haven't been able to in what feels like forever.  I've put in over 2,000 words today, words I actually feel good about for a change, and I'm not finished yet.  I don't want to play video games.  I don't want to watch TV.  I don't want to knit.

I do want to write.  And I am.

Riding the Wave in Five Minutes
Chapter One
Saya: Boohoo, I hurt my friend in a game of go.
Touya: How bad did you lose?
Saya: I didn't.
Shindou: How bad did you lose?
Saya: I never lose!
Touya: Want a teacher? o.o

Chapter Two
Shindou: So, wanna go out?
Touya: I'm oblivious, so sure. Because I know you don't mean on a date.
Shindou: Wanna be my best man?
Touya: Yep. That's why I'm oblivious.
Shindou: Remember all that bad shit that happened?
Touya: Yep. It was pretty bad. Say, wanna hang out more?
Shindou: Well, I guess, since you're going to be in my wedding...

Chapter Three
Shindou: Yep. That really was some bad shit I went through. I'll bet the reader would like to know what it was.
Touya: Isn't my student so cute?
Shindou: Woe is me, she reminds me of Sai.
Touya: Weren't you supposed to tell me about him a few YEARS ago?
Shindou: Yep. Sucks to be me.

Chapter Four:
Saya: Oooh, Shindou's famous! Wait, Shindou's a bad man...I think.
Touya: Your grandma had a heart attack, but I know all about that because my dad had one. Trust me, I'm an expert.
Saya: I hate hospitals.
Shindou: Cheer up, I'm awesome!
Saya: But...you're a bad man. o.o Or maybe not. Zzzzz
Grandma: I'm not dead, yet!
Touya: Did you hear something? Let's have a sleepover!

Chapter Five
Touya: I don't know how to have fun. I'll call Hikaru.
Akari: I'm just answering the phone to remind you that you can't have him...or can you?
Hikaru: Ha ha! I can have fun and you can't! But I'm too busy with my angst to enjoy it.
Saya: Tell me a bedtime story. And it had better be about Sai, because we all agree it's about time!
Hikaru: ...

Chapter Six
Hikaru: Once upon a time. The end. There, that's the story of Sai. I hope you caught that all.
Saya: Okay, good night.
Akira: o.o That explains so much!
Hikaru: You believe me? Waya didn't. Not even with good sex.
Akira: GAH! I don't need to hear about that!
Akari: GET A CLUE AND GET A ROOM, YOU TWO!
Hikaru: Thanks. You always know just what to say. =P

Chapter Seven
Saya: Gee I'm cute, and I'm hanging out with the go pros.
Kurata: I'm a pompous windbag, but I'm adorable that way. And you're a cute kid.
Ochi: I am sinister, bitter, and jealous. Mwahaha. I am an evil genius.
Hikaru: Ochi, my bestest friend! Isumi, my other bestest friend! Isn't Saya cute?
Akira: Touch my student and you die. And that means you, Ochi.
Hikaru: Oh shit, it's my ex! Here Ochi, touch Touya's student!
Ochi: What am I supposed to do with this thing? Oh well, wanna play go?
Saya: You're a bad man.

Chapter Eight
Akira: I can't believe you let Ochi touch my student! You're a bad man!
Waya: I'm here to make you feel jealous. And to make Hikaru feel like a nutcase. Bye!
Hikaru: It's not what it looks like! I didn't even get to first base! And he wants me to see a shrink.
Akira: I hate you, but I have lusty bad feelings for you. Kiss me!
Hikaru: We'll get caught!
Akira: I'm such a repressed goody-two-shoes, nobody would believe it. See? ~smooch~

Chapter Nine
Akira: Told you so.
Hikaru: Nobody's seen us yet!
Kurata and Isumi: What are we, chopped liver?
Akira: Told! You! So!
Hikaru: I'm running away! And paying the cab driver the 5000 yen I owe you!
Akari: Hikaru, you're an idiot. I can't fake-marry someone as dumb as you. Go away and get back to smooching the cute boy.

Chapter Ten
Saya: So. Grandma is coming home. Today.
Akira: Yep.
Saya: Sensei, do you think I might be Sai's reincarnation?
Akira: Well, if you are or if you aren't, you're good at the game. Keep rockin' it, little girl.
Saya: Yay! What about you, Shindou-sensei?
Hikaru: I need to admit my undying love for Touya.
Saya: Okay, it's about time, but that doesn't really answer my question."

It might be time to open something else, because I remember I was always the most prolific when I had several writing projects going on at once, instead of trying to concentrate on just one at a time.

I think it's time to start writing short stories more frequently, and give in to the occasional urge to do fanfic.  I don't know why I gave up on a technique that obviously worked for me for so long.  I suppose I thought that if I wanted to write ""for real"" instead of ""just"" fanfic I had to set aside a lot of what made writing fun.  And if I sucked all the fun out of writing, it's no wonder I've had a block for so many years.

"event","Okay, it's not so much changing my mind as changing how my mind works.  I tend toward more analytical thought the first half of the day, and more creative thought about an hour before I want to go to bed.  If I give in to the creative urge, I usually end up setting sleep aside a while.  

The window of opportunity for creative expression didn't used to be so small, but I don't know what happened to change it all around really.  Was it the time of day?  10pm is when I used to be at my most creative, even if I'd just woken up.  I'd usually spend a lot of time during the day reading or doing other things where I take in information and just think, and then I'd enjoy a creative spree when I got that out of my system.

Lately work is interfering with that, just when I started to get it back.  I've got the most *time* to write in the mornings when I have a day off, or when I work in the evening.  So, how can I change how I think?  I know there was a time when I could do a one-shot fanfic within an hour of waking up with the right prompt.  Same thing with continuing a WIP, if I left off somewhere that was easy to pick up again.  Does anyone have any ideas how to make that happen again?

It might be a matter of just writing.  Blogging, stream of consciousness, just putting words on paper until my creativity waves the white flag and gives in.  It seems slightly inefficient right now, but in the long term it might help.  But, does anybody have any shortcuts?"

I have Kevin Smith followed on Twitter and have for months...the latest big thing about Southwest Airlines caught my attention right away but the last two days I nosed around in the details.  In a lot of ways it's just one person fighting the machine.  They ""win"" because they're bigger and have a louder voice.

Then there was the guy who ran his plane into the IRS building in Austin.  Why would someone do that unless they were at the end of their rope?  These days our government is vast and powerful and lacks human compassion, and I can completely understand feeling that the only way to voice your frustrations is as a martyr.

The Dalai Lama is supposed to meet with our president, and this is making China bluster and threaten.  One giant country...one giant government...one giant collective of great power...against the spiritual leader of Tibet.

My heart is sick.  We all know that we live in this state, of those with power using it to oppress and ignore the problems of every individual entity.  We are the individuals, and we are the cogs in their well oiled machines.  We called Kevin Smith a fatty and kicked him off the plane.  We drove that man, and countless others, to suicide over IRS codes designed to madden US subjects into submissiveness.  We stand by and allow injustice to prevail.

These are the reasons I wanted to write.  These are just parts of what made me want to put my opinions and ideas into words and let those words be heard.

I lost my way for a time, and I never really learned how to voice my protests, but I need to remember.  I didn't decide to write for me.  I decided to write because I can't think of any other way I have a chance make the world a better place.  And this world sorely needs bettering."

"event","<i>Reply to this meme by yelling ""Words!"" and I will give you five words that remind me of you. Please post them in your journal and explain what they mean to you.</i>

<b>CCS</b> -  Writing fanfic for CCS made me grow up, as a writer.  It helped me understand that it takes work to be noticed, and to stay noticed.  It gave me a thicker skin, and a broader understanding of writing for others and writing for myself.  More than that, though, the series itself touched me.  It brought me into anime and manga, and it changed how I think and who I am.

<b>motherhood</b> - Oh, what a scary, wonderful, HUGE word!  I didn't want to be a mother, at all, ever, until I was 23.  I was certain I would be too terrible at it, and I didn't want to screw up another innocent human being the way I had been.  At 23, I realized that that fear might actually make me a better mother than I was afraid of being.  It's served me well.  Yeah, I'm probably screwing Anakin's life up even as you read this, but I'm not dating child molesters or molesting or beating him, so I figure I've beat the odds as long as I love him and fear ruining his life.


<b>college</b> - I start online classes on the 24th.  It's pretty intimidating.  I had a dream last night that they made you follow mazes to the right answer and other gimmicks to make sure you're actually the one doing the answers or something.  I'm hopeful, but also filled with apprehension.  I'm at the mercy of my family and feel pretty powerless...but this is the first step in having my own power and responsibility again, and I hope it's a good example to my son.

<b>determination</b> - It's amazing how much ""no viable choice"" looks like determination from the outside.  Yes, I keep walking forward, but sometimes it's baby steps, and sometimes there are days when I just stare straight ahead and say I'm walking forward in my heart when I know I'm standing still.  And maybe, just maybe, from the outside it looks like I have all kinds of excuses to give up and sit down and let myself fail...but from the inside, I have no choice.  No alternative.  I hope I never do, no matter how hard it is.  The thing I'm most determined to do is not to let my chronic depression destroy my life.  Literally.  Some days it tries to trick me and tell me that Anakin would be better off if I'd just die.  And I hang on by my nails, pushing forward, because I'm happily too scared to ruin his life by letting depression ruin mine.

<b>writing</b> - When I was little, I was told I was going to be a famous singer.  My grandmother had had some sort of prophetic dream before I was born, and as soon as I showed any hint of talent for music I was pushed in that direction.  For the longest time I thought that I was fated for music, it was meant to be, and I didn't have a choice.  But, writing is my choice.  Writing is my escape from fate and the expectations and control of my family.  Writing is my independence, and my way of being me, for me, because I'm me and not an extension of my childhood."

"event","I'm taking online classes through University of Phoenix.  I'm aiming for a degree in programming.  Umi talked me into it, when I was rejected for food stamps earlier in the week.  And OH it feels so much better to try to pick myself up and brush myself off than to beg for help from unsympathetic jerks who don't understand the living situation I'm in right now.  (It was humiliating enough asking for charity from the government, admitting I'm powerless and begging for help.  It was BEYOND humiliating to then be rejected.)

Okay, truth be told I'm terrified of this decision.  I'm putting myself in debt up to my eyebrows and there's no guarantee I'll get a computer job better than a phone tech support job in the end.  I've seen others go through it, and it's scary competitive right now.  But, it's better than sitting around and doing nothing more productive with my life than playing WoW.  (Okay, raising Anakin is productive, but it's nothing more than what every other parent in the world does.  It can't be my sole defining value.  What sort of example is that to him, especially at his age?)

I was worried that my family wouldn't be supportive, but so far they're more excited than I am.  (That's pretty damn excited, by the way.  But, they're not going to be paying back my student loans, so...)  They see that I'm doing something with my life, and no longer exchanging power for security.  They see I want to better myself.  The only negative thing I've heard is ""University of Phoenix is a little overpriced..."" but that's it.  And it was half-hearted.

I'm finally taking responsibility for myself again, after all these years.  It's a scary, but necessary step in not being a waste of space.  If anyone's got some spare luck to send my way, I would appreciate it!"

"event","I've just had someone ask me about this story again, and I don't know what to say.  I desperately want to finish it, but I'm having some difficulties in real life right now that make it difficult for me to write.

I know it's taken years between chapters for, oh, the last six or seven years.  It's not fair to anyone reading it to wait so long, especially when a few years ago I managed to put out three or more chapters a week of various fanfics on a regular basis.

I haven't been able to write anything original for a while either, so at least everyone who is a fan of my fanfics can take solace in knowing I'm not just ignoring fandom.  There's just been too much for me to keep up with, and I've lost my emotional balance.  I wish I could use all of the experiences I'm going through to fuel my writing, like I used to do, but I can't find any stable emotional ground to stand on in able to do that.

If you give up, if you have given up, I apologize and I can't blame you.  I want to finish everything I've started, but wanting doesn't make it so.  I'm going to try, but I'm not going to make any more promises that I don't know if I can keep.

I'm glad that people enjoy what I've written, and I hope I can write with such freedom and productivity again in the future at some point."

"event","Random thought:

Sometimes, it seems that bisexuals just can't fucking win.

If you end up with someone of the same sex, homosexuals congratulate themselves on finally getting you past the ""trial"" stage, because bisexuals are just afraid to admit their true preference.

If you end up with someone of the opposite sex, it was just an ""experimental phase"" that you got through and now you're back on the right family making track.

When I fall in love, I just fall in love.  What I find between their legs is infinitely less important than what's between their ears.  I prefer women, but since I ended up with a guy and had a kid that doesn't matter to certain people.  It's like I'm being humored!  ""Yeah.  Suuuure you like girls...""

Men are easier.  Women are more attractive.  That's how it is for me.  Stop assuming I'm this perfectly normal straight girl, just because I've got a kid and don't shave my head!  Life is hard enough, without people thinking that my sexual preference either doesn't exist, or it's just an excuse to get laid more.

At this point, I don't give a shit about having sex ever again in my life.  I just want someone to love.  I'm not a hedonist.  I just don't think love should have limits."

"event","So, I've had an eye infection for, uh, longer than I should.  (I'm stubborn and scared of doctors and have no insurance, shush.)  It spread from my blind eye to my good eye, and day before yesterday it started munching on my ear.  And so, after much ""I don't want to be a bother to anyone"" I finally agreed to let my dad take me to a doctor and pay for the visit and the prescriptions.

Also, in the last few days, it started to effect my eyesight.  I thought at first it was just eye goop from the infection getting in the way, but it's more than that.  So, I haven't read my friends list, or much of anything, in the last three or four days.  The subtitles on Kyou Kara Maou are big enough that I've been curled up around my laptop watching that, but that's about the extent of it.

I should be better in a few days.  I don't know if my stupidity/fear will have any lasting and lingering repercussions, but we'll see.  (Honestly, scared about this.  WITH my glasses on, I could make out the third line of the eye chart.  Barely.  It's that bad.  And I don't want that to be permanent.)

There's a LOT more going on.  I can't begin to go into it all, seriously.  But, you guys don't read my LJ to listen to me whine about RL crap anyway...  haha

Checking this over for spelling mistakes/typos is getting a little irritating on my eye, so I'm stopping now.  Just...I'm on antibiotics, the doctor wasn't scary OR condescending for a change, and I should be better in a few days, if anyone was worried."

Instead, I headed to the WoW forums.  The general forums.  I saw a suicide note get mocked and then locked down.  That made me feel a bit down, and then I saw this thread:  http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=16137075626&sid=1&pageNo=1

Random acts of kindness.

If people on the general WoW forum can be nice, I guess there's still some hope for humanity.

I do wish more people would at least make some sort of attempt to be nice, kind, or gracious.  To see more positive things in the world around you.  The never ending need to tear others down is really depressing.  So, go find something nice in something someone else has done, and go be nice to someone else."

"event","I spent a LOT of time on WoW last week.  A little bit of escapism, a little bit of trying to get ahead.  I was a bit on the irresponsible side with it, but Anakin was out of school for two weeks for spring break and so it was hard to do something that requires a lot of concentration like writing or editing.  I guess I can kinda ""blame"" my lack of productivity on him, but now that he's back in school it's time to get back into the swing of things.

This weekend I had another break in the routine, and boy did it shake me up!  I haven't been to a concert in 10 years.

I feel like I need to pause and emphasize that for a moment.  Ten years.  Okay, just shy of ten years by five months?  Nine and a half years?  Close enough.

For someone who, once upon a time, music was my LIFE...that was rough.  <lj user=""desert_dragon42""> was kind enough to drag me out of the house (kicking and screaming) and remind me what I'm missing.

A good concert for me is positively orgasmic.  It's earth-shattering.  It's mind-altering.  I completely lose myself and become one with the music, and time stops, and it's everything I wish sex was.

No, really.

We saw <i>Disturbed</i> on Saturday.  I think I can honestly say it was the best concert I've been to.  There's some tough competition there, especially since I saw Kiss at the height of my obsession with them, but this was better.  I went in knowing that I really like some of their music and that I'd appreciate it, and I walked out with a new musical obsession.  Right now I'm listening to them while I edit ""Wings of a Fallen Angel"", and it's perfect.  I know I'll be using some of their songs to write to, especially for climactic scenes that need a lot of energy and emotion.  I'll also be hunting for <i>Lacuna Coil</i> songs later, because their music made me go weak in the knees.  (The other bands were great for seeing live, but nothing I could write to.)

I'm still riding on the musical high.  I've missed this feeling so much.  I really hope I don't have to wait another ten years to get here again.

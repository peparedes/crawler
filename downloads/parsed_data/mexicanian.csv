"event","Just so everyone knows, I had to write all this twice because somehow with a combination of keys, I managed to push the browser back button and lost all of what it had taken me like 30 minutes to write, so I'm trying to remember what I wrote, but it probably won't be as good as my original.

Wow, okay. So it's been awhile...a very long while. A lot of things have changed with me, but nothing I really felt the need to update. I guess I just haven't been in an update kind of mood since forever. (and everyone who cares what happens and reads this pretty much already knows) I quit O'Charley's...big surprise. I liked the people I worked with, but I hated most of the people I waited on. Many of them deserve to have drinks poured over their big, fat, cocky bastard heads. I got a new job, which I love. I did have both jobs for a while, but I really needed to have some time to not be working during the week. It wasn't the best idea I've decided on doing. I did want to get another job during the Christmas season to have some extra moolah, but it's a little late for that now. Oh well. The time went by so slow at O'buttcheeks and it felt like I was working 60 hours a week when I wasn't even working 40. The time definitely goes by a lot faster at my new job. 

So now I work at The Goddard School in Woodlake with 2 and a half to 3 year olds. I absolutely love it. I love the kids, most of them anyways. Kids really do say some pretty funny things. Like fashina body. Instant classic. They are a lot of fun, and most of the time I just get to be a big goofball and keep them entertained, oh yeah, and occasionally, I work a little bit. Mostly during naptime. Tee hee. My co-teacher is really cool too. She reminds me a lot of how I remember Tia. She's older, 24, she's funny and she's nice. Recently we have been talking about getting an apartment together (more frequently these days, but I'll get to that later). I think we both had our concerns, at least I know I did, about working together for 6/7 hours a day and then going home and being with each other for the remainder of the day. That's a lot of time to be with someone and not get tired of it. She just had an interview yesterday (Wednesday) though and she seems to really want this new job. I really want her to get it, but I know the classroom is going to be hell for the first week or so that she's gone. It will make her a lot more money because we all know a teacher's salary isn't poop, and she will get to travel a lot. I mentioned to her a nice 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, kitchen, dining room, living room apartment around here for $650 which is very very reasonably priced. She was interested, but told me she wanted more of a 3-bedroom apartment in the 8 or 9 hundred range. She seems to be doing very well for herself in the monetary department. She doesn't seem to have any bills except her Saturn, she graduated college, and has lived with her parents, who still pretty much pay for everything. She knows I don't make that much and that I have my insurance, my car, my car repairs, and my cell phone to pay for that my parents bought me when I didn't have any money to pay them back. I told her that I didn't think I could do that right now, and she said not to worry about it, that she could pay the rent and I could pay utilities. Sweet.

Lately I've been pretty sick. Coughing, sneezing, runny nose. Beautiful, I know. It could have something to do with the fact that I wipe runny kid noses 40 hours a week or that it went from a chilled 50 to a foot of snow 11 out. My immune system loves that. (Thanks eb) The weather is also on my poop list because it attacked my baby and made him not able to come home and see me! V Tech is also on ""the list"" for canceling all the morning exams and opening later when the weather was worse in the afternoon. Buttheads. I'm keeping an optimistic attitude about it, but if they cancel it again, I'm going to be very upset. One extra day is enough.

I'm really excited about Christmas. I'm the best girlfriend there ever was and got Charlie something super sweet, among other things. Also I can't wait because I get to see Mandarin and SREE! and Tia if we get to see her. I'm not sure what her plans are as of now. On Friday (tomorrow), I have my work Christmas party from 7 to 9 at my director's house. Then Saturday, a bunch of us are planning to go see The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. Not my first choice, but I'm still excited. I wanted to see it anyways because I remember watching it when I was little and the lion was all electronic looking. It was silly. My first choice would be Memoirs of a Geisha, but alas, it hasn't come out yet. It comes out in select cities on the 16th, but Richmond is sadly not one of them. Otherwise, I think, it opens nationwide on December 23rd. I know what my Christmas present will be! Speaking of Christmas, my sister, Lauren, told me the other day that my parents are planning to go to Florida for Christmas. I will not be partaking in this trip for several reasons: 1) They are only taking the trip to take my step-dad's car to Atlanta, probably to ""pimp it out"" more or get it worked on with the money that they could be using to buy milk and other assorted groceries that we haven't had in the house for about a week and a half now 2) They are leaving ON CHRISTMAS to drive to Atlanta, stay the night, then drive over to Florida to see my step-aunt and cousins, one of which was pregnant the last time we went down there, but no one knew or found out until her mom was called into the hospital and walked into the room and saw my cousin holding her daughter 3) They have yet to mention it to me, and 4) I've already made plans for New Years and I refuse to miss it. So I'm sure I'll be staying home alone again like last year. Hopefully I can get some money out of it for taking care of the dogs and cat and fish and of course my mother's beloved Christmas tree. We'll see how that goes.

My sister is standing behind me now with I guess homework, so I'll finish later. But I think that covers the bulk of it. Maybe."

"event","So people are talking shit about me again...even though I hardly talk to ""them"" anymore. I thought we were friends, but if certain people are just going to talk to other certain people about things they know nothing about, then i don't really feel the need to be friends with their kind anyways. You put 2 and 2 together and made 5. You have no idea what is going on in my life, and why i am the way i am now. The only people who know are the only people who cared enough to find out. So if you didn't care enough to find out the truth, then why do you care enough to talk about it behind my back? If you're just doing it to start drama, then take your bullshit somewhere else because i really don't care enough to deal with it. If you have a problem with the way i live my life, or the way i am, then fuck you. If you can't deal with it, then don't.

"event","<b>$1 million treasure hunt hidden in pages of fairy tale</b>
NEW YORK (AP) -- There's an unclaimed $1 million out there -- somewhere.

The jackpot is actually 12 jewels hidden in very public places around the United States. Think diamonds, think rubies, think the rarest, most perfect Kashmir sapphire.

All you need to do to get any or all the gems is to decipher clues in the book ""A Treasure's Trove."" The clues lead to a dozen 18-karat gold tokens. Author Michael Stadther, who hid each of the tokens himself, promises that they are all in public places where they can be easily accessed without digging, moving or disturbing objects or structures.

Once a token is in hand, it can be redeemed for one of the jewels.

And Stadther is releasing a clue not contained in the book for the first time this week: ""Hint: Tackle repositories.""

""A Treasure's Trove: A Fairy Tale About Real Treasure for Parents and Children of All Ages"" is the realization of the author's 25-year-old dream to create a puzzle sandwiched between the pages of a classic, timeless fairy tale. He was inspired by 1979's ""Masquerade,"" for which author Kit Williams hid a necklace made of rare gems and gold that was found in the English countryside three years later.

""I studied fine arts and had a B.S. in math -- I thought I could do this. But for me, one treasure wasn't enough. And the story had to outlast the treasure hunt,"" Stadther says. ""Hopefully, 100 years from now, people will be looking for the 'jewels' in the story.""

So far, no one has claimed the real treasure.

Stadther has received hundreds of e-mails since his self-published book was released in November. The messages come from everyone -- 6-year-olds to an 88-year-old woman who says her mother is working on the puzzle. There are chat rooms on the Internet devoted to ""A Treasure's Trove"" and the book might get translated into Chinese.

When he does readings at schools, the 52-year-old Stadther is treated like a rock star with scores of kids charging at him, hoping to snare a clue.

""The kids go right for the puzzle and the treasure,"" he says. ""I thought the treasure was for the parents and the story was for the kids, but the opposite happened. I hear from parents that they're so happy that there's a story the family can read together that's not dumbed down.""

The story centers on 12 forest creatures who employ a pragmatic woodcarver, his half-elf, half-human wife and their winged pet, Pook, to save their mates who disappear after being crystallized by a falling dust. Woodcarver Zac can't see the fairies because he won't free his mind, but Ana can, and she helps guide him; Pook, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Stadther's American bull terrier, Misty, shows the value of loyalty and love.

""It's a family book, it's a family project. ... It's a love story as well. It's a novelette for kids,"" says Stadther.

In its first two months, nearly 100,000 copies of the hardcover and paperback versions, and the companion ""100 Puzzles, Clues, Maps, Tantalizing Tales and Stories of Real Treasure"" have been sold. Before early orders for the new ""Harry Potter"" book started to come in, ""A Treasure's Trove"" was ranked No. 2 on Amazon.com, and it debuted this week at No. 3 on The New York Times' list of best selling children's paperbacks.

It's rare, but not unheard of, for self-published works to become big successes, said Amazon.com's Kristin Schaefer Mariani. ""A New Kind of Science,"" by Stephen Wolfram, immediately shot to the online retailer's top spot in 2002 and the same thing happened with ""Ask and You Will Succeed,"" by Ken Foster, in 2003.

""We do think that it is the 'treasure hunt' theme that's selling this book,"" Barnes & Noble Booksellers' buyer Pat Brigandi said. ""The jeweled pieces look incredible. Who wouldn't want to find a 6.36 Kashmir blue sapphire -- even if it is the head of a spider?""

With many retailers sold out, Stadther is shipping directly to customers and is using the sun room at his suburban New York home as his warehouse.

Stadther never intended to self-publish his book, though he now says all the publishers that rejected him, some rather unkindly, did him a favor. By doing it all himself -- from the writing and illustrating (each picture took about 300 hours), to learning Adobe Photoshop and buying the rights to the photographs featured in the puzzle workbook -- Stadther not only had creative control, he is now making a lot more money.

The initial $2 million investment for his book project came from his banking software company, which he sold five years ago. His biggest cost was creating the pricey jewels based on the 12 forest creatures. The gems mostly came from Jewelry Designs in Danbury, Connecticut, a partnership that happened by coincidence.

The author was shopping one day in Jewelry Designs for a gift for his wife and noticed a hummingbird brooch. He went to the back office to talk to owner Robert Underhill, who was intrigued by Stadther's book idea but didn't sign on at first.

""I wasn't certain it was all for real, but once I saw how much time and effort he put into it, you could see it was real,"" Underhill said. ""I went ahead and made an ant.""

That ""ant"" has 4 1/2 carats of pave diamonds for legs.

""A Treasure's Trove"" has been a dream job for the company's artisans, Underhill said. ""It's the most fantastic thing we've been involved in. It's maybe the most fantastic project in jewelry.""

The most challenging jewel was the beetle because it was ""a grotesque character"" that Underhill and his staff needed to somehow make beautiful, he said. They used black diamonds to encrust its head, a canary diamond for they eye and more diamonds on the insect's belly. Then there are the moveable parts: The jaws depress and the wings open to show a 10-carat blue tanzanite with surrounding diamonds and latticework.

But will readers ever find it?

Stadther, who acknowledges that he's not great at word puzzles, thinks so: ""It's not rocket science. It's all in front of you."""

"event","Time for an update I suppose.

I would have to say, surprisingly, the most meaningful and evolved and ""right for me"" kind of relationship is the one that I have with Amanda. I say this in shock simply because of the enormous fight we got into which seemed to inevitably ruin and end our friendship for all of eternity. I am however, glad that it turned out to be a different story. The time we spent away from each other was actually a good thing for us. She learned that she didn't need to be dependent upon Tia and I, and we learned that we didn't need to be dependent upon her. She developed a life without us, and we did so without her as well. Now you may be thinking, ""What a great way to evolve a friendship, total lack of involvement in each other's lives during and after the 'big fight',"" but as strange as it may sound, you're exactly right. Now that we're friends again, we both have our own lives as well as one with each other. We understand that we don't need to talk to or call each other everyday, and that if someone has something else going on, it's not a big deal if one of us doesn't get to hang out every time the other is free. Even though she's only here on the weekends, if we can't hang out all the opportunities we get, it's not a big deal. Even with this distance that we seem to have in our friendship, we still consider ourselves to be the other's best friend. We both matured and moved on with our lives and got over all the high school drama bullshit. I consider this to be the most effective type of friendship I have. With this base already established, we are free to move on in our lives together. Somewhere down the road, we'll get married, or have kids, or move away, and we'll be accustomed to living our own lives while still involving each other just enough to make our friendship last forever. 

On a different note, Charlie comes home on Friday, and I'm so excited because he gets to stay the whole week instead of just a couple days. So far our week doesn't seem to be all too busy, but there is one thing on the schedule...Spongebob Squarepants! That's right, we're going to see the movie because we're undeniably the coolest people around.  That's all I can remember us having plans for as of now. I'm assuming we'll do something for our anniversary too, but I'm not sure what's going on with that. I don't really know what's going on with actual Thanksgiving day either. Hmm...interesting. Oh well, I'm sure we'll get our plans all straightened out and have a super duper good time as usual. I do know I have to work either Friday or Saturday night, but I'm not sure which, and also on Sunday, but that's in the morning, so it shouldn't be a big deal. Yay! Only a few more days! 

I think that's about it. If I forgot something and I remember it later, I'll come back and put it in. Oh, and thanks to MK for actually writing about happy things and not just always bitching in her journal. It's a nice change of pace."

See what I mean? 

Tomorrow is going to be kind of a busy day, but it'll be ok because it will be better than sitting around at home all day with nothing to do I suppose. My mommy comes home on Saturday...I have to spend the rest of the week with Tim...poop. I really need to clean my room. It's very messy. Messy girl! I also need to finish my laundry...at least I did my jeans...and colors. YAY! All I have left are my whites, pinks and delicates....ooo la la. Hopefully I'll get all that done before Charlie comes home on the weekend. YAY!! I'm super duper excited...I haven't seen my baby in a month. I miss him so much. I can't wait. Hmmm...I hope I get this job with circuit city, even though my parents don't really want me too because it's on the west end. On the weekend, we're going to go to the club and have some fun. I want to get a haircut, so maybe Charlie can help me pick something out. BIG BUCKS BIG BUCKS NO WHAMMYS NO WHAMMYS BIG BUUUUUUCKSS STOP! Anyways, I have a plan, hopefully it doesn't get screwed up. Although, it wouldn't surprise me if it did. I need to ask my daddy about Spring Break...before Christmas. ""With the headband, I'd say there's a 78% chance."" Talked to Meghan today, she's such a sweetie. She's going to bring Charlie back on October 8th. She wants me to come see the UVA vs Tech football game. We're planning it. She doesn't know what time it is, so we have to work on the plan later. I can't wait to get out of the house. It's driving me nuts. Brandon played a joke on me tonight, maybe Tia was in on it...maybe not...I don't really know. It wasn't very funny at the time, but I was glad it was a joke in the end. At first I thought I knew what was going on, but Brandon plays an awfully convincing Tia, so I got confused and reeled in. Good thing I'm not a fish. My eyes are itchy. Maybe I'm getting allergies. I like my brown shoes. They make me tall. I like my white ones too, they're pretty, and they have some pink. Pink is my favorite color. wee! I'm getting up kind of early tomorrow. I should probably go to bed. I think I will. Goodnight"

"event","Do you ever have those days where you just wake up feeling sad for no particular reason? Well, i've been having more than usual lately, and I don't really know why. Hopefully I'll just get over it. 

Today was the worst. Nothing really happened that would make it a bad day, it just was. I started thinking about my mom and Tim, and I realized that most of the time, I don't really like them. Mostly Tim because he has the power to change my mom's decisions regardless of how strongly she feels about the subject. It really upsets me when I think about college. It gets to me so much that I'd rather just not mention it anymore. Things would be so much better if my dad just lived in Virginia. 

It's been a whole week since I got to see Charlie, but I think we're doing ok. It helps a lot that I get to talk to him everyday. I don't know what I would do without him. No one has ever meant as much to me as he does, and I just hope we make it through whatever happens. sigh...

I just need to sleep."

"event","Alright, my new theory on life...

If being the good kid gets you nothing more than what being the bad kid gets you, why try and be the good kid when you can be the bad kid and just do whatever you want?

I was the good kid for awhile...I always let my mommy know where I was, I didn't talk back (...that much- at least not like I'm doing now), I quit doing all the bad stuff, staying out late, having the occasional malt beverage, lying. I was doing good, yet my phone still got taken away, and I still get yelled at on a daily basis for the stupidest stuff ever! THEREFORE, I give up on being the good kid. I'm not going to go out and rob stores or get drunk or anything like that, but I'm just going to go out when I want. I'm also staying out late no matter how much they ""ground"" me. Plus, since them saying ""you're grounded"" means pretty much nothing, there's nothing left they can do to me. Are they going to take away my car? NO! why? because I don't have one...simple enough. Are they going to take away my cell phone? NO! why? because I don't have one...they already took it away. Are they going to take away the TV? Maybe, but I don't care since the only time I watch it is either when they're in bed, or when Charlie's here and we're just chillaxin. Are they going to take away the computer? Maybe, but since they're never home, and I have about 10 phone cords stashed in various places, they can take it away, and I can just plug it back in. Also, if they take away the computer, I'll just talk to people on the phone all day, and then when they won't be able to make incoming or outgoing calls, they'll just give the computer back to me. What else is left that they could possibly take away? absolutely nothing! 

Another reason I don't care what they say anymore is because they don't give me anything...at all. Not even dinner anymore. They don't buy me clothes or anything else, they don't make me dinner, all they do is let me sleep in the house...whoopty doo. Bottom line: my parents are stupid heads, wait...let me rephrase...my mom and TIM are stupid heads! It's not fair to say ""parents"" since technically my daddy is my parent, and I like him. 

The only thing left for me is Charlie, and soon I have to leave him, so this is just awesome! I'm thinking I'll be gone for about a month, so I'll have to find some way to exist without him for that long. I think the time away from my mom and Tim will do me a lot of good though because, right now, I can't stand this house. Living with people I actually like and can stand should be a nice, relaxing change. Linzy and I always have a good time together, and she's my best friend, besides Tia of course. Lately I've been a bad sister, and I haven't talked to her much, but hopefully that'll change, and it can go back to the way it used to be...long long long conversations. I miss her a lot, and I know she and my dad want me to go to KU next year, but I don't think I can do it. It'll just be like every other school year, where I don't see them for 11 months, then I get to go back for a month before I have to come back and start school again. 

I really want to work at Victoria's Secret...I picked up an application the other day, so I need to get that all done and give it back to them, so hopefully they will hire me, and I can work in a pink store! yay pink! Right now, I really just want enough money to get my own cell phone so the buttheads can't take it away. I really like my old one though, so I'll have to save for a little before I can get that one back. Maybe sprint is having a deal or something...hmmm. 

Today was my last day of school! It hasn't really sunk in yet that there's no more high school...ever. It doesn't even really feel like the school year ended. I'm glad it did though because I was tired of school. Now all I need to do is get out of this house, and I'll be all set. I guess I just need a change of scenery. 

Now that that's all done with, I'm going to sleep. I think Saturday we're all going out to dinner for Johey's birthday, and maybe out somewhere after too (clubbing...oh yeah!!), depending on what he wants to do of course, so one day is planned...woo! Also, I wanna go to the beach sometime, so someone let me know if they want to do that."

Today was a good day...Memorial Day 2004...I did absolutely nothing. Actually, the fam and I went and saw Shrek 2, but after that...nothing. It was ok though because I did absolutely nothing all day with Charlie, and I could do nothing with him forever and still be happy. 

Actually, now that I think about it, I'm pretty sleepy, so I'll just finish this later, or maybe just leave it like it is. Good times.

The highlight of my day thus far has been doing my calculus homework which I don't even understand, which I have a ton of, and which is due tomorrow...I guess I would have started on it sooner had I not lost my calculus book which I, like the dumbass that I am, put all my assignments in, so I wouldn't lose them. Good going...

I saw Johey today which was a nice change of pace to say the least...i guess I know one person cares. 

I also was forced to open a bank account today which I'm not allowed to touch...sweet! I need some money out of it, but I know, since it is my mom and all, that I won't ever see the money again, and it'll just rot in the bank until they take all of it away because I never do anything with it...just like the last time i was forced to open a bank account in Kansas City...good times...I love it when people take my money! 

My sister was also caught smoking weed or something today, and although I don't smoke weed or do anything else bad, I'll probably still get in trouble for my sister doing it because my parents are awesome like that! 

AND even though I paid my stupid ass cell phone bill, i still don't get it back...I only get it at certain times that the dumbasses deem appropriate. I even asked my mom since it was the bill they were concerned about, and since I paid it why I didn't get it back, and she said ""where do you get your money?"" followed by ""we can't afford it to happen again."" Ok...bullshit! For usual things I do get my money from them, HOWEVER, to pay them back for my cell phone bill which I already knew was going to be over, I actually paid them back with my money, so she can kiss my ass...and if it goes over again, guess what...I'll just pay it again! <b>What a concept!!</b> I doubt $60 is going to break them anyways...it seems they just like to whine about it because they can. Whatever...I have my phone anyways because I took it, and although I'll probably get in trouble for this too, I don't really care. Oh well, might as well add it to the list of ""things to yell at Melissa about""...if anyone wants to add anything to that list, you better hurry because spaces are filling up fast, and I can only take so much per day!"

Not like anyone cares because the only people who read this thing anyways are people I talk to everyday, so you all already know what's up. Buuuut, I'm gonna update anyways...

Didn't go to school today because I'm cool like that...not going to school means I can't go to practice, and not going to practice means I can't play in the game tomorrow...seeing as how I don't care anymore because Herz plays favorites anyways, I didn't feel the need to go to school at all. Plus I forgot to get my homework stuff I needed for Monday out of my locker on Friday, so I wasn't ready for today's classes anyways. I don't know about anyone else, but I'd rather not go to calc class without my homework just to get yelled at and then have my fingers gnawed off like little sandwiches by Ms. Dunn. (nicknamed- two ton Dunn...you draw your own conclusions)

I did get up at 6:40 though because I had to take Lauren to school because Tia wasn't going, and Tim had already left, and I knew my mommy would be extremely angry if she had to wake up to take her. I went in and told her that Tia wasn't going and Tim had left and Lauren needed a ride, and before I could finish to tell her that I would just run her to school, she said, ""Shit!""...now for anyone who knows my mommy, you  know how often she says a bad word...very rarely...so she must've been pretty angry. I guess she just doesn't like to be woken up. I told her I would run her to school though, and she was ok after that. After having to sit through so much traffic in the stupid parking lot this morning, I've come to the conclusion that Clover Hill has the worst parking lot set-up ever! Oh well, only like 30 more days of dealing with that mess anyways.

"event","<b>Can't Wear Low-Rise Pants in This State?</b>

 Louisiana is considering a law that would ban people from wearing low-slung pants that expose skin or ""intimate clothing,"" reports the New Orleans Times-Picayune. The penalty? A fine up to $500 and up to six months in jail--just for showing your undies over your beltline.

 The bill was proposed by State Rep. Derrick Shepherd because he was annoyed at catching so many glimpses of boxer shorts and G-strings. ""I'm sick of seeing it,"" Shepherd told the Times-Picayune. ""The community's outraged. And if parents can't do their job, if parents can't regulate what their children wear, then there should be a law."" If the bill is passed, it will be tacked onto Louisiana's obscenity law that restricts sexual activity in public places, as well as the sale of sexually explicit items.
  
  The American Civil Liberties Union has already stepped up to the challenge, saying the bill probably won't meet the U.S. Supreme Court's standard for the prohibition of obscene behavior under the First Amendment. ""What about a woman who is wearing a bathing suit under her garment or she has something like a sarong wrapped around her and it's below her waist,"" ACLU chief Joe Cook told the Times-Picayune. ""I can think of a lot of workers, plumbers, who are working and expose their buttocks.""

"event","So far Spring Break has been fairly decent. I mean, I've been pretty busy, more so than expected, but the stuff I've been busy with hasn't been stuff I don't enjoy doing, so I guess I can't really complain. The best part of Spring Break was obviously the first weekend, but that really can't compare with the rest of Spring Break since that was special, so we'll just count that as it's own little dealy-bobber. Yeah, I like that word, so get over it. Anyways, Monday and Tuesday, I got some shopping done and added some things to the ever growing collection of pinkness that I've come to acquire...A new pink tube top that ties in the back and has a pretty flower on it, a new thumb ring with a little pink jewely in it, a white purse with a pink M on it, some pink flip flops (because I needed some to match my shirt), and I think that's pretty much it for the pink stuff. I was looking at some sunglasses, but I can't find any that I like as much as the other ones I had and accidentally mutilated....oh boy, they were definitely beyond repair. I was also being super-sister and running Lauren and some of her friends around on Monday. Then today, I got up and took a shower, and as soon as I stepped out of that my sister decides to tell me that she needs to take the movies back ""RIGHT NOW"" because they're already late...I don't know why she thought it would make a difference if they were an hour late as opposed to 3 hours late because to blockbuster, late is late hunny. Oh well, so I threw on some pants and my hoodie, put my hair up, and took her to blockbuster...as soon as I get back from there, Lauren tells me someone called this morning, but she didn't know who because Morgan answered the phone, so by checking the caller-id, I find out it was Johey and I call him back to see what's up...he wants to go bowling. I get ready for that, and then leave, but realize that I spent all my money at the mall, so I don't have enough to pay for myself, Lauren, and Morgan, so it's off to my mommy's work. Half way there, she calls and tells me that she's not there, she's at the mall..she works real hard...so we decide to meet her at her work, until 1 minute later when she calls back and tells us to come out to the mall instead. We go out there, and I get $60 and i'm ready to leave....not good enough...i'm forced to go look at prom dresses...something I definitely don't want to do considering I probably won't even go. Oh well, a nice solid 10 minutes of my life wasted...we leave for bowling and after 1 game, i'm ready to go, but no...everyone wants to bowl some more, so we end up bowling 3 games, and then we go to Chic-fil-a for some lunch/dinner. Tommy was there, so that was a nice surprise...he's such a sweetie. After that, i finally get to go home...only for about 5 minutes though until Tia asks if i want to go with her to drop her pathfinder off at the shop...seeing as how I hadn't hung out with her for a while, I definitely wanted to go. On route, Johey calls and asks what time i wanted to go to the movies, which i had totally forgotten about...so, since the shop is all the way in Petersburg, I didn't get home til late, so he decides to go to a later movie. We finally leave Petersburg to return home, but not until I take a sweet picture of a white 350z that Nissan had on the lot...a trip with a purpose...I love it! Anyways, I get home, and what do you know...5 minutes later, my mom asks if i can run Lauren over to her friends house...super. I do that, and as soon as i pull into the driveway, it's time for me to leave once again to go to the movies...go to the movies, go home...finally get to call it a day at 12:17. Tomorrow, I'll be gone all day because Lauren invited me to go with her and some friends to Kings Dominion. Then Friday, I won't be home because it's a fun-filled day of Busch Gardens with the fam, and then Saturday, I won't be home either because it'll be another fun-filled day with the fam only this time at Kings Dominion...I don't know why, but for some reason, I think I may be kinda tired of amusement parks by the end of the week. 

Good news: Minutes start over on Friday, and I'm pretty sure we only owe like $12ish, so that's sweet. After Friday, I have daytime minutes again...yay! Oh, and the boys changed my voicemail message today...I haven't heard it yet, but they said it's good. All I know is my mommy didn't like it when she heard it...whoops! haha, oh well. I also figured out how to put a different picture to show up when different people call, so if you want anything specific, you better tell me. 

Alright, I'm sleepy, and I have to get up in the morning to go to KD, so I better go to bed."

"event","Drink <b>THIS</b> Much Water Every Day

The Institute of Medicine, an independent group of experts that advises the federal government on health issues, has issued a specific, but controversial, recommendation on how much water we need to drink daily for proper hydration: Rely on your thirst to tell you how much water you need.
Beyond that, the Institute issued these guidelines:
Women should consume about 91 ounces (2.7 liters) of water a day.
Men should drink about 125 ounces (3.7 liters) per day.

<b>What's controversial about this?</b> The Institute says that water contained in food, coffee, beer, and other drinks all count toward the recommended daily amount. Sports medicine experts beg to differ. Loudly. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has other advice for serious athletes and weekend warriors during prolonged exercise or hot weather: If you rely on your thirst, you won't be drinking enough water. In addition, some drinks, such as coffee and beer, actually dehydrate our bodies.
 ""Our fluid intake is mostly behavioral,"" said Dr. W. Larry Kenney, the president of the ACSM and a professor of physiology and kinesiology at Pennsylvania State University, explained to Reuters. ""On a daily basis, people drink when they eat meals, when they get a little thirsty, when they walk past a water fountain."" He agreed that most of the time relying on thirst to dictate when and how much fluids you drink is acceptable. But the gotcha is during exercise. When we exercise, our thirst may not accurately tell how much fluid has been lost from sweating. So relying on that alone could do our bodies harm. What should you do? Kenney advises exercisers to weigh themselves before and after a workout. ""Strive to drink enough to get back to beginning body weight,"" he told Reuters.

The ACSM recommends the following guidelines for thirsty athletes:
--Eat a nutritionally-balanced diet.
--Drink adequate fluids during the day before exercise or an athletic event.
--About 2 hours before exercising, drink about 17 ounces of fluid.
--While you are exercising, drink early and at regular intervals so you replace the water you are losing through sweat.
--The best drink for athletes is cold water.
--If you're exercising less than an hour, you don't need specialized sports drinks that contain electrolytes and carbohydrates."

"event","I don't know why, but I'm absolutely in love with this song: 
The Reason- Hoobastank

Someone told me it was by Incubus, but upon investigation of my sister's cd case...i discovered it was on the Hoobastank cd I bought her for Christmas. (It's actually the title of their cd too...go figure)I don't really know why you all really care about that little tidbit of information, but I just felt like telling ya anyways. 

I guess, while I'm here, I can update a little bit...

Our softball team is actually pretty good this year! Surprise, surprise! I don't think we've played any district games yet, so these games that don't matter will be good practices. We played Thomas Dale and beat them in the scrimmage, but then i think we got cocky about playing them and lost 4-1 for our first game. We played Henrico as another scrimmage, and beat them as well. We played our second game of the season today against Matoaca who just moved up to the triple A division with us, so we didn't play them last year. We ended up beating them 6-1...so far we're looking pretty good. Tomorrow we head out to play against Amelia. Hopefully their pitching is better than the people we've been facing. I've heard it's decent, but we'll have to wait and see. I don't know why the other teams pitching is so slow this year...I mean, the Thomas Dale pitcher has an incredible amount of pitches, including her drop curve, which is a bitch to hit, but she has absolutely no speed. Even when people scootched all the way up in the box, most were still ahead of her pitching. She's not as bad as the Matoaca pitcher though...I was very surprised when she was the starting pitcher. Most pitchers can get away with being a little slower, but this girl's pitches didn't even look like they had any speed. The second string pitcher they put in wasn't too bad...I would have thought she would be the starter, but who knows what the coach was thinking. Oh, by the way...our umpires today sucked. Well, i guess the plate umpire was ok, but the first base umpire was crap. He called us out at first like 6 times when it was obvious that we were safe...what a stupid head. Oh well, we still beat them! Hopefully we'll keep up this way of playing all year and beat some district teams. Thomas Dale beat Bird...and we beat Thomas Dale before, so I'm hoping we'll beat Bird...For those of you who don't know....Clover Hill beating any district team (well, usually any team at all, district or not)is a major upset. Maybe our softball team is turning around!? Hmm...who knows? 

Let's see...what else has been going on...
School has been pretty normal, haven't gotten in any cool fights or gotten in trouble lately, so that's no fun. Haven't seen any movies...haven't been bowling or anything fun like that. Went to the new Wendy's...mmm frosty! Been playing softball a lot since games started. We're scheduled to have 3 games a week for awhile, but occasionally, we get a break and it drops down to two. It's almost inevitable that we go over our daytime minutes on the cell phones this month since we still have two weeks left until our plan starts over, and we only have 3 minutes left...yeah, we're good like that.

Well, this entry really has no purpose...so if you read it all, I'm sure you're wishing you hadn't! haha....sorry. I still love you."

"event","Last night was definitely a lot of fun. 

I went to the Fighting Gravity concert at the Canal Club with Johey. Tommy was supposed to come, but alas, he is but a poor college student with no source of income. We did, however, stop by his dorm on the way out there and hung out for a good half hour. I wish he would've come though, I think he would have really had a good time. Anyways, the concert was awesome, and it makes me happy whenever I get to do stuff like that. We had to leave around 12:45 though because my mom is a super-psycho-retard and made my curfew 1:15. (even though I didn't get home til 1:30. I know, I know...i'm a rebel) It was better than her initial curfew of 12:30 though. I figure if I pay $12 to get in, I'm staying for more than an hour! So after i argued with her about it for about 15 minutes, she says 1:15, and since I figure I'll come in whenever I want anyways, I agree so I can just leave. After we leave the concert, I'm really thirsty, so I decide we need to stop by a gas staion to get me some water. Well, little did I know, every gas station on the way back to my house is closed. Who ever heard of a gas station that closes at 1 am?? What happens if someone from the highway needs gas damn it?? Stupid, stupid. After 10 minutes of driving around to different closed gas stations, we say screw it, and just decide I can get water when I get home. I drop Johey off, then come home, and of course, my mom is still awake. I just walk past her and go to my room. Then I come back to get on the computer, so I can talk to one of my favorite people, and my mom is on the computer. She asks me how it was, and my response, ""It would've been better if I actually got to see the end."" Then she tells me how uncalled for that was...and again, i just walk away. She finally goes to bed, but not without telling me that i need to check the fish tank light to make sure it's off because it was left on the night before and ""the poor little fishys were fried."" I find that kind of funny, just as long as my little baby rocky makes it. (he's my little rock fish...the best fishy in the whole tank!) It was already off when I came home though. Anyways, I got on the computer and talked for a little bit, but I soon fell asleep since I only got 1 hour of sleep the night before and I was staying up late again to go to the concert. So, now I feel badly for not saying goodnight or anything similar to a closure for a conversation. 

Now I'm off to teach my little sister and her friend how to pitch...I must recall the repressed memories of being on the mound.  They've been bugging me about it for a week, so I figure I'll just do it. (no, bugging me for a week does not mean that you'll get your way with ALL situations) I still need to figure out something to do tonight. Maybe, depending on what time she's done with Amanda, I'll see if Tia wants to go see Barbershop 2. I guess it also depends on how she's feeling cuz she wasn't feeling very well last night. We'll see though."

"event","I've decided that I have one fear that rises above all the rest and kicks their asses: 

Rejection. 

Rejection is worse than ripping off your ear and throwing it to a starving, blood thirsty seagull...sick and twisted i know, but most of you know why i used the example.  

This fear is beyond belief. It can make you feel like the most powerful person alive, and it can make you feel like the smallest, most non-meaningful person to ever grace the earth with your presence. It can hurt people you love, it can hurt people you hate. It plays both sides and gets away with it. It's just a damn good playa. (haha I'm so white, but you guys know you still love me) 

*Anyways, back to topic--

Anytime rejection is involved, risk is involved. Risk is a topic all it's own, but here we'll just use it in relation to rejection. If you don't go through with something, you have ""what ifs"" to consider, and if you do go through with something and it turns out badly, you're best friends with rejection again. But then there are those times...the times where things work out. The times when it was all worth it, no matter what. When something so great comes out of it you couldn't imagine why you never thought of taking the risk in the first place. Those times that just make life worth living. 

So, here's to rejection...the pain, the depression, but in the end, the best times ever."

"event","ok, in light of recent events, I've decided that they need to be addressed. 

1)Amanda and I are no longer friends. 
     -this is, in fact, true, but it was her decision, so it's whatever. 

2)It's no one's fault...it would've happened eventually anyways, and apparently she's been building up to this moment for awhile
     -it's ok...don't dwell on the past!

3)We may never be friends again, or we may eventually regain some form of friendship...no one knows, but when the time comes, what happens, happens, and it'll be ok.
     -Everything will be OK! 

4)Tia and I hit some rocky points in the friendship, but we're all squared away now, and everything's going fine...Haha, listen to me, I sound like a doctor fresh out of surgery. Oy. (and now I'm apparently Jewish! grand!)
     -Our friendship was strong enough to make it through that, so hopefully it has helped us build a stronger foundation that will allow us to deal with future problems (if any are to occur)

5)Johey and I are better friends than ever, and better friends than I even imagined we would be.
     -I wouldn't give up the friendship that he and I have for anything, and I'll always be there...no matter what (it's just unfortunate that this series of events happened during the time we were becoming closer)

A lot has changed over the past few weeks, and normally I don't do very well with change, but there have been a few people who helped me through it. Whether it be talking to me about what's going on, or just plain talking to me about anything, it helped. Even if it's as random as a dog or a game! My life could've been made into a soap opera for a day or two, but after that it went back to boring, old Melissa-vision. There was the occasional grand gesture or mishap, but all in all, it's livable, and I don't think it's that bad of a life to have. I don't think anyone I know has a life that is completely and utterly shitty. Accept things as they are, and don't let them tear you up inside. Adjust and move on. 

Having said all that, there's a quote from possibly one of the stupidest most non-serious movies that fits this situation perfectly. (even though, I must say, I do think this movie is funny as hell) 
     
     ""Don't take life to seriously, you'll never get out alive!""

"event","Just in time for Valentine's Day gift giving comes word from the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. that chocolate will help your heart to keep working longer and stronger. You read that right: Eat chocolate. Live longer. It doesn't get any better than that.

 The magic ingredient is flavonoids, which are chemicals that help improve circulation, cut blood pressure, and may provide other health benefits, reports The Associated Press. Flavonoids are protective antioxidants that are also found in green tea and red wine. The hardworking members of the National Academy of Sciences spent all day on Tuesday locked up in some Washington, D.C. conference room tasting a variety of drinking cocoas and learning about the history, cultural impact, and medical benefits of cocoa, which is the plant that produces the raw material for chocolate.

 The ancient Aztecs sang these words: ""I drink chocolate, it makes me happy, my heart rejoices."" This may not be a metaphor. Dr. Helmut Sies, chairman of the department of biochemistry at the University of Duesseldorf, Germany, told AP that over the past 10 years scientists have come to see a definitive relationship between consuming more flavonoids and lowering the death rate from heart disease. Cocoa can also be used to lower blood pressure, according to Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg of Harvard Medical School. The trick is finding chocolate that retains cocoa's flavonoids, since cocoa processing often reduces the level of these heart-healthy chemicals.

And as with anything that seems too good to be true: Eat chocolate in moderation since it is high in fats and sugar.

Ahh, choclolate...nature's aphrodisiac."

Missi -
    Today is an amazing day of revelation for me.  You have made me see what I should have been looking at all along.  My whole life, I've been searching for a guy...that perfect guy.  When I thought I found him, I lost him.  What I have come to know is that, I'll never find that perfect person, until I find myself.  Until I know who I am and who is most important to me in my life.  Who I know will never leave me, and will never hurt me or break my heart and who would never lie or decieve me or pretend to be things that they are not...people who are willing to stick through the hard times with me, as well as the good, and who will support me through all of my decicisons that I make, good or bad.  There are few people in my life that I can truly count on, and that I know will not use me...even in my family.  I honestly believe that you are one of those few that I can see in my life forever, and that I know will never abandon me no matter what the situation...fights, distance, love...no matter what I can say that I would never choose a guy over you.  No matter how petrified that I am going to end up alone, the truth is that family is forever, and you can't risk that over something or someone that you're not sure of, or that you don't understand.  Plus, in the end, sometimes you never know if that ""perfect guy"" is going to be there...things happen and people change, but no matter what, your family should always be there.  I will do everything that I can to keep you in my life for as long as I live, because I know that I would not be the same person without you and that you have been such an influence that I feel like I am a better person just for knowing you.  I know that you will forever impact my life in wonderful ways, and I'd be a fool for ever thinking anything else or for ever letting you go.  As much as we go on talking sprees, then non-talking sprees (I think you know what I mean) in the end we are always there for each other.  Your letter touched me so deeply that I almost cried and the only reason I didn't is because the sleeping pills/anti-depressants supress that action a little.  I am honored to know that you can see me as your maid of honor, and I hope that you would have the same feeling for being mine.  I know that wherever you decide to go to college we will keep in touch just as we have been.  I am not worried about being able to see you more or less, because I know that our friendship is strong enough to surpass anything.  I know that being apart so much is just building our relationship up, and making it stronger.  I do hope, I have to admit, that you ultimately decide to come back to Kansas for college, not only for me, although that's a big part of it, but for you.  I honestly think that you would be happier here.  Whatever you decide, I will fully support you.  You should go wherever you think that you'll be the happiest and where you can pursue your dreams the most.  You deserve that, and you deserve to be happy and successful in everything that you do; as I know you will be.  If things go as planned, and good God I hope that they do, I will be able to be a part of your life when all things start to piece together and you are as happy as you should be.  I love you so much, and I am greatful to have a sister, and a friend as amazing as you.  The time until your graduation and this summer, could not pass fast enough.  I can't wait to be there, and according to your dad, well today at least, we will probably stay until Lauren gets out of school...so we could do that beach week that you've been talking about.

"event","Three members of the University of Georgia's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity are in trouble with their own fraternity chapter, and one is facing criminal charges after he allegedly shot a raccoon that was behaving erratically. After the animal was killed, another fraternity member skinned and burned it, while a third ate some of the meat.

 The Associated Press reports that sophomore Erik Robert Zimmerman, who was arrested on Thursday on a misdemeanor charge of animal cruelty, shot the animal with a pellet gun when he found it near a trash container on Dec. 12. Animal control officer Kim Winter told AP that Zimmerman should have contacted authorities when he saw the raccoon since the animal's erratic behavior could have been a symptom of rabies. Shooting the live raccoon with a pellet gun is an inhumane way to killing it, which led to the animal cruelty charge. Conviction of a misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of 12 months in prison and a maximum fine of $1,000. Zimmerman is now free after posting a $1,000 bond.

 According to the Red and Black, an independent newspaper serving the university, the three will have to apologize to their fraternity chapter and face mandatory 25 hours of community service at the local Humane Society, along with several other sanctions. This punishment was decided by the local fraternity through judicial proceedings independent of the University of Georgia.

Today Johey and I went bowling, and yes, he beat me, but only by like 10 pins! Then we went to Tommy's to watch Super Bowl, but with our crew, there wasn't much watching of the actual SUPER BOWL, just goofing around and listening to music and such. It was me, Johey, Tommy, Floyd, Brandon, Gavan, Allyson, Kim, Tia showed up at like 8:45, then Devin and Amanda showed up. It was aright eventhough everyone wanted the Panthers to win. Oh well. The half time show was crazy, especially the end with Janet and Justin...hmm nakedness maybe?? I didn't think it was at first, but then Jeff called Johey about it, so i guess it really was her nakedness. (As Tia just showed me, it was in fact, her nakedness!!)

Also tonight I was talked into going to the Sadie Hawkins dance coming up at C-Hill. I really don't want to go, but Johey really wanted to go, and Tia wouldn't go unless I went, so I'm being a trooper and going so they'll be happy. I don't know who i'll go with.

If anyone wants to go though, let me know...I'm open to suggestions!

Oh, today before I left, I burned my leg...a chemical burn. It hurt so badly. All I can say is I'm never using super glue again! (and now my pants have a ""hard spot"" on them) That sounds so wrong, but for those who were thinking it....shame on you!! get your minds out of the gutter!

Tomorrow, I really don't want to go to school bcuz of Clark's stupid presentation Tia and I (plus the other half of our group) have to do. I would really like to skip it, but that's not gonna happen. Hopefully it'll be ok.

Oh, by the way, I've decided that I need a new boy...and a valentine!"

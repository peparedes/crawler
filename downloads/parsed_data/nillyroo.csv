Seriously, though.  Today, I created a French Pandora station (which I've called Croissant Radio, btw). I have a couple of quirky-cute French songs thumbs-upped on another station, and one came on today, and I decided I wanted to hear more music like that.  Clickity-click, and an hour later, I'm still sitting here with a goofy smile on my face and tapping my toes to these cheeky tunes.  I love it.

Just yesterday, I told Rory that she should be a mime for Halloween next year.  Black & white striped shirt, black pants, white gloves, black beret, and adorably painted face.  Oh, and a sign that says ""Bonjour! Trick-or-treat!"" so she doesn't speak when she goes door to door (that will be the REAL challenge, duh).

I'm craving baguettes, and brie, and chocolate, and champagne.  And I've never had one, but I'd love to eat some of those beautifully colored macarons I've been seeing all over the internets.

Well, Paris, IDAHO.  (population 500 and change)

One of my favorite blogs, Oh Happy Day, is giving away a trip to Paris!  Not Paris, Idaho, but the totally legit Paris, FRANCE!  Mr. Roo and I just applied for our passports, so don't you think this is a perfect time to get an awesome European stamp on them?  I mean, it's cool and all to have a Canadian stamp on your passport, but it's not so glamorous to admit that the stamp will come from a one day port in Vancouver (or is it Victoria?) on an Alaskan cruise later this summer.

Anyhooters, visit Oh Happy Day, specifically this post:

"event","I've had all this time on my hands the last few weeks, so why haven't I been writing?  Question of the year.  Or at least the month.  Okay, maybe just this week.

So, why all the free time?  I got my toes operated on!  Finally.  

I had surgery two weeks ago, on May 3.  A slightly different surgical experience, in a couple of ways.  Geez, I sound like I'm a surgical pro, but I guess I have been around the Operating Room a time or two.  So, this surgery took place at a really nice surgical center, not at a hospital.  The pre/post-op areas have recliners instead of beds, and all of the staff was really, really nice.  My nurse and I share a birthday, and my anesthesiologist looked like Santa Claus.  I was a bit surprised that the operating gowns were as papery as they were, but I just figured it was because they were disposable.  

After getting prepped for surgery, which included a ""yes"" and ""no"" marking on my legs to indicate the proper appendage to work on (way to cover your bases!), I walked into the OR and situated myself on the bed.  It was COLD in there (typical), so they gave me a warm blanket.  But, it was thin, and I was thinking to myself ""They said they were going to keep me warm!"" The next thing I know, Santa Claus gives me something that looks like a dryer hose with warm air coming out of it.  He told me to hold onto it for a minute while he administered my anesthesia. He put the awesome dreamy-time stuff in my IV, and I could feel it right away.  He told me to pick out a really nice dream, and then he took the dryer hose, and hooked it into a valve my operating gown - so cool!  I had this constant stream of warm air to keep me warm!  Of course, ten seconds later, I was completely unconscious, and didn't have much time to fully appreciate how rad that really was.

When I woke up a couple hours later, I had a hella case of the shivers, which is typical with anesthesia and me.  They warmed me up and then wheeled me back to my recliner, where Jason was waiting for me.  He told me the waiting area was really nice, and that he'd created a foursquare check-in for Lewis-Clark Orthopaedic Associates.  Some toast and juice were scarfed down (I hadn't eaten since the night before), and they wheeled me to the exit.  Jason chauffered me to pick up my narcotics (hello, hydro), and then took me home where I proceeded to spend the next few days in a bit of a haze.

Thankfully, I had that hydrocodone because, holy crap you guys, bone pain HURTS.  Way more than any other muscular pain, or pain from incisions.  But, after a few days, the pain lightened up, and I weaned myself off the hydro.  I could see how that could be a little too easy to like.  I went back to the dr. last Monday, and they changed my dressing and took some x-rays.  I'm not sure I was prepared for how ugly my foot was going to look.  Swelling, bruising, oh, and FOUR incisions.  Yikes.  

When they removed my old dressing, my big toe was sticking out almost in the opposite direction of my other toes, mostly because my big toe had a whole bunch of bandaging around it.  I could've hitch hiked with that thing!  They wrapped it with fewer bandages, and my foot is slowly going back to normal.  Which feels weird.  I would imagine it's like when you have braces and get them tightened.  How it hurts for a bit, but then feels normal.

Have I mentioned I've not been allowed to put any weight on my foot?  No walking, no driving, nada.  It's been a bit of a tough pill to swallow, because I'm a pretty independent gal, and I don't like being at the mercy of others.  I've been able to bathe pretty much every day, and I've even managed a few showers, thanks to some awesome dressing covers my sister sent to me. I prefer the super awesome scooter to clumsy crutches.  I go back to the dr. tomorrow - hopefully to get my stitches out!  And, I'm also going back to work on Thursday.  I've been working half days since a few days after surgery, but I've been able to work mostly from home, which has been nice.  I do some work, then take a nap.  I do some work, then eat some lunch, then take a nap.  I could get used to this :)

Anyhoo, that's about all that's new in my hood.  I have a bionic foot now.  Sweet.

Oh, and Jason is now the foursquare mayor of Lewis Clark Orthopaedic Associates."

"event","Well, time to wrap this sucker up.  

Joe wanted to know if I had any old mix tapes hiding out.  In fact, I don't.  I did my fair share of mix tape making in my adolescence, and it usually involved scouring all the cds I owned (or my dad, or my sister) for ballads.  They were probably quite horrible.

The closest thing to a mix tape I have is when Jason surprised me on my 30th birthday with a cd he burned of all the mp3's off my old computer that had died.  It involved him hooking up the hard drive to a working computer and moving the files over.  A labor of love so that I can listen to all the Aqua, Vengaboys and other cheesy pop, plus some other awesome stuff.  It's now housed in my itunes, and we rock out (well, do stupid dances ...) to some of it with the kiddos now and then.

And SSB wanted to know how the Mister and I met.  Long story short, we met on the internet, pre match.com when meeting people on the internet was somewhat scandalous.  We met on IRC, when you used to be identified with an email address when you entered a chat room.  I noticed Jason's email address, and we started chatting.  One day, he and another fella from Idaho came down to visit me in southern Idaho.  I thought Jason was super charming and pretty cute.  Jason thought I liked the other guy.  He kissed me for the first time on my 19th birthday, and the rest is history.  

After we met, the rest of our courting path was fairly traditional.  When I moved up to northern Idaho, Jason's dad came down with him and met my family before loading up all my stuff and taking me home with them.  That was back in the day when all my worldly possessions would fit in the back of a pickup.  We were engaged (near the same spot where we shared our first smooch) after dating for nine months, and married a year from the day we got engaged.  This June, we will celebrate our 15th anniversary.  He's a good fella, and I am a lucky girl.

And there you have it.  30 in 30 (or 60, but who's counting?).  Did you learn stuff about me that you didn't know before?"

It has faded over the years, but I have a scar in the middle of my forehead, right near the top.  I think I was three when it happened.  One of my brothers was playing little league, and I was crawling around on the bleachers.  I lost my footing and fell from the top bleacher and hit my head on a metal garbage can.  I ended up with a nice little gash that bled.  My oldest brother walked me all the way to my grandma's house, which was a good six blocks away.  

So I had a giant scab on my forehead.  I was little.  I picked it.  All. The. Time.  So I ended up with a nice scar on my forehead.  I called it a dent.  

And over 30 years later, it's still there."

Oh geez.  To be ""moved"" by something doesn't mean I have to have cried, right?  So, here are a list of media things that have ""moved"" me:

Movies - The first movie I watched obsessively: Adventures in Babysitting
Movie I can nearly quote from start to finish: Pretty Woman
Movie that I will cry every time I watch it, without fail: Toy Story 3

Songs - First song Jason and I sang together in the car: Out of Tears by the Rolling Stones
Song we sang with the kids, loudly at times: High Enough by the Damn Yankees
Song that I hope Rory and I will sing together forever and ever: Pokerface (Glee cover)

Books - when I was in college, I told my good friend Jen that the best book I'd read was The Chamber, by John Grisham.  She told me I needed to get my ass to the library and check out some books.  I read Jane Eyre, I <i>tried</i> to read The Shipping News, and I read The Bean Trees (Barbara Kingsolver).  And then I read The Poisonwood Bible (Barbara Kingsolver).  All these books moved me in some way.  So I owe Jennifer Warnick a big Thank You for making me put down the crime lit and start reading REAL books.

The thing I dislike most about my appearance: my crooked teeth.

BUT!  This is soon to be fixed.  Well, as soon as I get my wisdom teeth pulled.  They never came in, so they have to be dug out.  Side story, I went in for a consult with an oral surgeon, back in 2003.  He was (and still is) the only oral surgeon in the area.  At that time, he wasn't in the insurance network, so when I went in to meet with their finance person and get my surgery scheduled, they told me it'd be approximately $3000 to get my teeth pulled.  I wasn't dying, so I decided that there was no way in hell that I was going to voluntarily spend that much money just to get some teeth pulled.

Fast forward a couple (okay SEVEN) years, and the university finally decides to offer a dental plan that includes adult orthodontia.  I can finally get braces.  Yes!  Oh, and the oral surgeon is now a preferred provider.  So I went in for a consult a couple weeks ago, and met with their finance person after my appointment.  The estimated cost of the procedure?  $425.  Much more palatable.

So I'll get my wisdom teeth pulled.  Then I can get braces.  And someday have straight teeth.

I've declared 2011 to be the year that my health savings account gets robbed.  Foot surgery + wisdom teeth pulled + braces.  Oh yeah."

"event","Man I am a slacker.

Something that scares me:

I don't know why, but it seems that once I started having kids, my body started falling apart.  First it was my gall bladder, that I got out when Jack was just a few months old.  Then I had a cervical polyp removed while I was pregnant with Rory.  Then I went and got a lazy uterus that liked to sit on my bladder.  All fixable things.  I'm feelin' good.

A couple years ago, I started having some issues with my right foot.  I'd get these stabbing pains that would come and go.  Some days I wouldn't feel it, and other days, I could barely walk by the end of the day.  So, I went to see a podiatrist, and learned that I have a neuroma in my right foot.  It's just a swollen nerve ending between two of my toes, and really wasn't a huge deal.  I wore ""sensible"" shoes for awhile and learned that vanity comes at a price.  Problem solved.  Temporarily.

Last summer, I started running.  I freaking loved it, and was gearing up to run my very first 5k.  A couple nights before the race, as I was finishing my run, I felt those stabbing pains again.  Dammit.  This time I also had a sore ankle.  Double dammit.  I walked the race instead of running, and made an appointment to see the podiatrist again.  It took a couple weeks to get in, and I'd stopped running, so by the time I'd got in my ankle was fine.

The dr. wasn't so much concerned with the neuroma as he was with the bunion that was so brightly apparent near my big toe.  After consulting, we decided that surgery was likely the best option.  But, with our upcoming trip to Disneyworld, I didn't want to chance that I wouldn't be completely recovered in time.  So, I decided to wait until after the trip.

After the trip, I scheduled my foot surgery, or at least I thought I did.  I showed up for my pre-op appointment, and the dr. asked if I wanted to get something scheduled.  ""Uhh, I thought that's why I was here"" was my response.  They didn't have my surgery scheduled.  So, we scheduled it - AGAIN, and he took some x-rays of my foot.  Looking at them, he pointed out that the length of my second toe was quite long, and likely the culprit of the neuroma.  He suggested shortening the length of that toe, which at first didn't seem horrible.  He made it sound as easy as going through the drive-through and ordering a value meal.  But then I started thinking about it and it freaked me out.  I got scared.

Combine my uneasy feelings with the fact that this office is run by a bunch of monkeys with HORRIBLE scheduling abilities and office management, my poor brain just churned.  I decided I didn't want this guy sawing on my foot, shortening my toes, and leaving me with the potential to be gimpy forever.  Okay, I'm exaggerating now, but that's how I was feeling.  

A couple days before my surgery, there was yet another scheduling issue - and that was the final straw.  I was not letting these people near my foot.  So, I called and made an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon and I have that consult scheduled for Monday morning.

I REALLY hope I can get some good answers at this appointment, and certainly hope I have a higher comfort level with the amount of care I'm getting.  I don't want to be stuck with wacky toes and a messed up foot forever.

I want to run again."

I'm a mom.  I'm a career gal.  Put those two together and you get one overcommitted chica.  My long term memory is amazing, but my short term memory leaves much to be desired.  Especially when it comes to making mental to-do lists.  If I don't write it down, chances are, I'll forget to do it.  And hell, even if I write it down, chances are I'll get too busy and forget to do it anyway.

Last week, I was visiting with Jason's mom.  Her birthday was coming up.  I said ""Well, it's usually you who does all the planning, so why don't you let us put something together for your birthday?""  She was totally cool with that.  So, we made tentative plans to meet at a brewery to do some beer tasting, and have our favorite pizza delivered there.  Awesome plans.  Except when you forget to share them with your hubby and, oh by the way, you leave town for a couple days for work and you're flying back home on the date of previously mentioned plans.

So a phone call between Jason and me last Thursday afternoon went something like this:

Jason: ""So, my mom was asking me last night if we were still on for Friday? Did we have plans?""
Me: (Oh shit.  You didn't tell him anything about Friday, did you?)  ""Oh Shit.  I forgot to have you call your brothers to make plans.""
Jason: ""Yeah, when I alluded that I didn't know anything about it, mom said not to worry about it.""
Me: (Feeling like shit because not only have I let him down, I've let his mom down.) ""Crap.  I'm sorry, honey.  Is it too late to make plans?""

As it turns out, his brothers didn't want to meet at the brewery.  So, plans were made to go out for pizza and that was that.

Fast forward one day.  I fly home and we're getting ready to pick the kids up from school, and I'm still trying to find a way to make this right.  So, we went next door and made plans with Jason's dad - we took him to town with us and met up with Jason's mom for beer tasting BEFORE dinner.  Fun was had by all, especially Jack & Rory who got their own cans of root beer!

Here's Rory and the birthday girl:

I honestly can't remember the last time I had a big ol' red-eyed runny-nosed cry.  It's been awhile.

So I'll tell you about the last two times I remember crying, even if it was only a little.  They both happened at Disneyworld.

Once was when, after a dinner with too much to drink was followed by a boat ride that was just about too long,  Jason's brother did a trot that resembled the waddle his grandma used to do when she was hustling to the bathroom.  That was bad enough.  Then he proceeded to be a little too happy to relieve himself in the bathroom.  There was a man in there with his kids who, after overhearing Jeremy's exalting, yelled ""I don't know what's going on in here, but there are kids in here!""  He could barely utter the story to us after exiting the bathroom.  We were all laughing so hard, we were crying.  Jason's mom may or may not have wet herself.  It took us a good five minutes to get settled down and not be so embarrassing.  I honestly can't remember if the kids were laughing along with us, or hiding in the bushes.  Definitely a top memory from the trip.

The second was a couple days later, when we went to the Animal Kingdom.  While there, we went to see The Festival Of The Lion King, which is a 30ish-minute long Broadway style production.  The kids were completely enamored, especially Rory.  You can see her getting into the spirit here:

But, when the show started, she really got into it.  Following the motions of so many of the performers.  It was adorable and as cheesy as it might sound, it was completely magical to experience.  I watched her move for a few minutes, her face oh so serious.  To her, she was in the show, and not in the audience.  And I cried as I watched her.  When it was over, she said she wanted to be in the Lion King.  And I believed it.

I will never forget that moment.  Watching her little hands move around in the air just like the performers before her.  I wonder if she's old enough to remember it."

So, let's pick up where we left off, shall we?

Today's topic: Something I crave

There's a restaurant in Lewiston where we like to go sometimes.  The last time we went, I ordered the 3 G's pizza for an appetizer - a flatbread with gouda, gorgonzola and red grapes.  Oh my, it was tasty!  The cheese was all melty and delicious, and the grapes still crunchy and sweet (but they didn't put nearly enough of them on, in my opinion).

So, I totally knew I could make this at home.  So easy!  

We buy those little Boboli crusts at Costco.  They're perfect for this.  I spread a thin layer of Rondele Garlic & Herbs Cheese, then layer some shredded gouda on top of that.  Then I slice a handful of grapes in half and put them on the cheese (cut side down).  Sprinkle with a little gorgonzola (or a lot, if that tickles your fancy) and then bake at 425 for 8-10 minutes.

Such a unique combination of flavors - it's heavenly!  And totally craveworthy."

Today's challenge is to show a childhood photo.  Well, I can only get my hands on one right now:

Those cheeks.  Those eyes.  They are mine!  An older photo before we grew out Rory's bangs would probably show an even more striking resemblance.  But this will have to do.

I love that kid.

And, I love her big brother who, by the way, turns eight today!

"event","Something I'm thankful for:

Especially on days like today, I'm thankful to have such awesome neighbors.  Not so much the neighbors to the east, but the neighbors to the west?  They're awesome.  And they're my in-laws.

You can tease us all you want.  You can ask ""How's life at Everybody Loves Raymond?""  But tonight, we were able to shoo the kids next door with plates of half-eaten dinner so we could rush off to meetings.  There, they may or may not have eaten all their dinner, for sure got at least one snack, and most definitely got lots of love.

My father-in-law is retired and currently serves as Grandpa-in-Chief.  We drop the kids off at school, and he picks them up.  Rory only has a half day of school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so she spends the afternoons with Grandpa.  It's pretty special.

Sometimes, we'll come home from work, not sure what we'll throw together for dinner.  And we'll walk next door to get the kids, and get invited to stay for supper.  Oh, and they always have cold beer in the fridge.

I think it speaks volumes to go on a family vacation with Grandma and Grandpa, and the day we returned to work and school, the kids were begging to stay longer at their house when we picked them up.

Thankful?  You bet."

"event","My favorite teacher:

Oh man, I've had lots of good teachers.  My favorite, though?  Mr. Holm.  I had him, I swear, for half my classes my senior year of high school.  Well, six of fifteen courses:  two trimesters of calculus, one trimester of AP calculus, and three trimesters of computer programming.  Nerdy is hot, right?

So, anyway - Mr. Holm.  Were his classes fun?  Not especially.  The classes were hard and he was a pretty stern instructor.  Maybe it was because it was one of the first times I noticed a teacher holding his students accountable, I don't know. But some students didn't like his teaching style.  There was something about him that just clicked with me, though.  

I got to see another side of Mr. Holm that not many others got to see.  He used to bring his elderly father into the pharmacy where I worked at the soda fountain, and they'd share a milkshake while his father's prescriptions were being filled.  I still remember that he'd ask for the shake to be made with vanilla ice cream and strawberry topping rather than just plain ol' strawberry ice cream.  He was very kind and tender, and it's something his students didn't see very often.  But I saw it every time he brought his dad to the pharmacy.  Maybe that's where I began to understand him.

But the best part of learning from him came after graduation.  It was a hot summer day when I got a letter from The College Board.  I knew exactly what it was.  It was my score from my AP Calculus exam.  I shut myself in our teeny bathroom and opened the letter, expecting the worst (typical me).  I got a 5 (the top score you could get).  I was astounded, and I was so proud of myself.  It was validation that it's not only possible but it's okay to be smart.  Mr. Holm showed me that.

He doesn't teach at my high school anymore.  A google search doesn't reveal much to his whereabouts, either.  I regret that I never told him how great I think he is, because I don't think teachers hear that enough.  Teachers are awesome, and the good ones?  Well, they're unforgettable."

"event","My favorite Christmas gift:

Oh gosh, it could have been the doll I got with hand sewn clothes and a handmade crib when I was in third grade.  Or it could have been the Camp Beverly Hills sweatshirt my dad gave me in junior high.  Or it could have been the bezel set diamond necklace Jason gave me for Christmas the year we graduated from college that, ten years later, I wear almost daily (yep, wearing it in the makeupless photo posted a few days ago).

I could have been any of those.

But let's rewind to the Christmas of 1995.  I was engaged to my sweetie.  It was Christmas Day, and I was unwrapping my last gift.  It wasn't huge, maybe a 10"" x 10"" box, 4-5"" high.  I peeled the paper from the box to reveal something that utterly confused me.  It was a pouring shield.  For a Kitchenaid mixer.  I didn't own a mixer.  I was SO confused.

Then Jason disappeared into our roommate's bedroom and emerged holding a giant box.  It was a Kitchenaid mixer!  At that point in my life, it was the nicest Christmas gift I'd ever received.  And it's brought me so much joy.

We've made banana bread.

It's pretty.  And something I would never splurge for.  (I mean, what kind of bargain-bin-scouring mama pays $400 for a duvet cover?!)

Well, when I got it, we were switching from our heavy winter bedding to lighter bedding.  So, it got put away, and kinda forgotten about.  Until last weekend.  Jason changed the sheets and, in a surprise move, put the new duvet cover on.  It's so pretty!  And, he fluffed up our duvet.  It's like sleeping in a marshmallow.  I freaking love it.

I love high-quality bedding.  It's even better when scored on a great deal (or especially when it's FREE).

Jason: ""You're a 38...""
Me: ""36DD""
Jason: ""Well, that's a nice fact.""

He's such a boy!

15 facts about me:

1. I'm a compulsive stationery purchaser.  But I suck at correspondence.  It's a 2011 resolution to be better about writing notes to people.  I can't say I'm off to the greatest start.

2. I'm a numbers girl.  I remember birthdays, phone numbers, addresses, etc.  Motherhood has tarnished that a bit, but I'm still pretty sharp.

3. I worked at an old-fashioned soda fountain in high school.  It was in a pharmacy.  I make a killer rainbow freeze (sherbet + 7up, mixed like a milkshake), and may have used those skills when it came to wooing Jason way back in the day.  He still asks for them when he's not feeling well.

4. I'm horrible at interrupting during conversations.

5. I was named after my grandma.  I used to hate my name when I was little, before I knew many other people who went by a nickname rather than their first name.  But now it's pretty special to me, just like my grandma.

6. I LOVE thrill rides, and am completely giddy that my kiddos got that gene from me.

7. I love to cook and try new recipes.  I even got Jason to LIKE a dish that had squash in it.  Go me!

8. Wipeout is pretty awesome.  I love any show that produces multiple belly laughs.  Interesting tidbit: it's the show where my kids learned the word ""moobs.""  Lord have mercy.

9. My favorite sandwich is grilled cheese.

10. I've never been pulled over, or received a speeding ticket.

11. I'm a total bargain shopper who hates paying full price for just about anything.  But I suck at using coupons regularly or effectively.

12. I was a month old before my parents gave me a name.  Until they agreed on a name, I was called ""pumpkin.""  Did I mention my due date was on Halloween?

13. I am birthday buddies with Julia Roberts.  And Bill Gates.  And Bruce Jenner.

14. My favorite color is red.

15. I totally have a brown thumb, but have managed to keep a pretty coleus plant thriving in my office for nearly a year.  I'm dumbfounded!

And there you have it."

"event","Something that makes me sad:

It might sound silly, but I am sad that I am not having foot surgery tomorrow.  Apparently, the dr's office failed to schedule it.  So when I went in for what I thought was me pre-op appointment yesterday, the doctor asked if I'd like to proceed with plans for surgery.  And I got confused, and totally annoyed.

Me: ""Umm, isn't that why I'm here?  I'm scheduled for surgery on Thursday.""
Dr C: ""Hmm.  I don't think I have any surgeries scheduled for Thursday.""
Me: ""Well, I guess that would explain why I didn't get the stuff in the mail that your receptionist said I'd have by the end of last week.""
Dr C: ""I don't think we can process all the paperwork in time to get you into surgery this week.  We could do next week, for sure.""
Me: ""Yeah, I have a trip planned to Portland two weeks from tomorrow. I can handle a trip two weeks post-surgery, but not one.""

Grr.

So, I'm scheduled to go in on Thursday, February 17th.  Why does this make me sad?  Well, I really want to get back on the road.  Running.  And I really was looking forward to a race in Spokane on May 1.  And putting this surgery off for another three weeks just doesn't leave me feeling optimistic that I'll even be ready for walking that race.

Who knows.

Grr.


Oh well.  I won't be gimpy for my Portland trip, which is good.  Right?"

"event","A talent I wish I had:

When I was growing up, I played the violin.  I started in the fourth grade, and minus a one-year stint of playing the cello in the fifth grade (I grew weary of lugging my cello to and from school), I played through my senior year of high school.  I was good, but I was not great.  I managed to hold court of third/fourth chair of the first violin section without a ton of practice.  I wish I had kept playing into my college years, and maybe even beyond.

I LOVE the piano.  I've never played, except by ear.  So, I would love to know how to play the piano.  And the guitar.  If I had these two talents, I would use them.  Specifically, at church.  We need good music there so badly.  

And I can carry a tune fairly well most of the time (except, ahem, if I've had a few too many cocktails prior to attending a concert), but if I were a better singer, I wouldn't turn that talent down, either."

"event","The last book I read:

Here's something funny.  I can't remember the last book I read.  It's not that it's been so long since I've read something, it's just that I went through, if you will, a reading ""growth"" spurt last year.  I probably read more books last year than I'd read in the last 10 years combined.  Not only did I read lots of books, I read lots of GREAT books.  Go me!  However, I did absolutely no reading over the Christmas holiday, so I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what it was I last read.

I'm pretty sure the last thing I read, though, was the Richard Castle series - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Heat-Wave-Richard-Castle/dp/1401310400/ref=bxgy_cc_b_text_a"">Heat Wave</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Heat-Nikki-Richard-Castle/dp/1401324029/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295642296&amp;sr=8-6"">Naked Heat</a>.  These books are ghostwritten by a fictional character from the ABC series, <a href=""http://abc.go.com/shows/castle?cid=showsitelinks_search"">Castle</a>.  I love that show!  Those two books certainly aren't high quality lit, but they were quick, fun reads.  You need those sometimes.

I also bought the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735819637/ref=oss_product"">Advent Storybook</a> that Jack and Rory and I read together each night before they got the little chocolate morsels out of their advent calendars.  We finished it on Christmas Eve, which I guess is technically the last book I read.

Currently in the queue is Elizabeth Edwards' <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Resilience-Reflections-Burdens-Facing-Adversities/dp/0767931564/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1295642853&amp;sr=1-1"">Resilience</a>.  It's making its way down the street - my favorite neighbor Alice read it, then Jason's mom, and now it's been following me around.  Maybe this weekend?  It's the first non-fiction book I will have read in a long, long time.

Oh, and I'm currently reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ralph-Mouse-Collection-Beverly-Cleary/dp/0064410048/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295642964&amp;sr=1-3"">The Ralph Mouse Collection</a> with Rory.  We're about six chapters in to the first book - The Mouse And The Motorcycle.  Anyone remember reading those?  I love Beverly Cleary."

[09:05] kristy: oh nice - and they were playing it?
[09:06] Darin: No I just saw it laying on the counter and remembered how much you played it when you were little.

Fast forward almost five years.  Each of our kiddos has a cheap-o mp3 player that has music of their choice loaded onto.  Jack's has music from the likes of Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.  Rory's has Kidz Bop (lord have mercy) and ... the old school Chipmunks Christmas album.  She LOVES it, and plays it all the time, singing along even though it's not Christmastime.

Not only does she look exactly like I did when I was little, but she does so much stuff similar to me, it's uncanny sometimes."

It doesn't happen every day, but it happens quite often - a hug sandwich.  This is what happens when a hug involves more than two people.  If it's me and Jason squeezing Jack in the middle, it's a Jacka sandwich.  If I'm in the middle, it's a Mama sandwich.  If it's all four of us, it's a family sandwich.  It usually involves discussion related to who is the bread, who is the cheese, and who is the bacon.  Because every sandwich needs bacon.  It sometimes involves singing, like below where poor Rory was getting serenaded to Chicago's ""You're The Inspiration"" at Jason's brother's wedding last summer.

"event","Okay folks, here it is.  30 blog topics in 30 days(ish).  Topic #1 is my workspace.

I'm an event planner for my alumni association.  I plan events as simple as happy hours and as complex as reunions for 500 people.  I also manage volunteers in a number of our alumni chapters and clubs nationwide.  It's kind of schizophrenic, so half the time I feel like a grown up with ADD.

My desk is messy:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kristy_mayer/5368067012/"" title=""my desk by kristy_mayer, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5125/5368067012_55903595f4.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""my desk"" /></a>

Maybe the mess contributes to my ADD, I don't know.  But my desk is huge, so naturally it's an environmental requirement to cover it with junk.  I've got notepads and post-it notes and notebooks.  My calendar is awesome.  I keep an electronic calendar for meetings and such, but need a pen and paper system for long range planning.  This calendar currently has full page months for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, and has last year's calendar in the back of the binder.  It's currently turned to April 2011.  Why?  Because I scheduled foot surgery this morning and was doing a count of weeks-out from surgery with some finger-crossing that I'll be roadworthy in time for Bloomsday (which is actually May 1, but I finished up my counting in April).  See the ADD patterns here?  Moving along ...

Oh, and see that dinosaur of a printer that takes up half my desk?  It's to the left of my monitor.  I've had the same printer since I started working here eight years ago.  The ink cartridges remind me of old-school cell phones.  They are HUGE!

And it's too bad that you can't see to the right of my phone.  Did I mention that my desk is six feet wide?  There's a magic 8 ball just a few inches from my phone, for those really important life-changing conversations that take place.  Like menu planning.  And voice mail.  I may or may not use that magic 8 ball when deciding if I'm going to call someone back right away.

And it's too bad you can't see above the old-school radiator that's behind my monitor.  Did I mention my office is in an old dorm?  Yep.  People have slept here.  People have done the dirty deed here.  Frat boys even lived here.  Thank GOD they painted and carpeted before we occupied this space last year.  I don't even want to know what kind of boy germs were left behind.  Oh but above the radiator?  Cute artwork.  That I borrowed from the internets.  And then pasted into a word document, and promptly emailed to my boss asking him to print them for me.  Because my printer is a dinosaur.  Oh yeah, and Timmy has the only color printer on our floor.  Yes, I call my boss Timmy.  He's got all kinds of nicknames - Timmy Ray, Timbo, T-bone.  I even gave him a tie for Christmas one year that had ""Timmy Ray"" screenprinted on it.  It currently hangs on the doorknob to his office.

So, like I said, my office is an old dorm room.  So I actually have an office with a door.  And a (giant) window.  And a closet.  And drawers.  It's kinda cool.  But I'm glad they took out the old-school hot plate and hood.  Because it was totally cramping my style.

I did include one more photo - shown below:

<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kristy_mayer/5368067260/"" title=""my office by kristy_mayer, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5084/5368067260_1190f8a905.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""my office"" /></a>

That's right.  I have a sofa in my office.  This sofa has been in this building longer than I have been alive.  But I'm the only one on our floor who has enough seating for our events team, so our weekly meetings take place in my office.  Lots of conversations about life, work, and other stuff happen here.  Naps may or may not have been taken here.

The curtains were found at overstock.com and have the same off-white color of paint that graces the walls in here, plus the gray color of my fabulously huge laminate desk, plus some blue and green that gave me some extra color in here.  We also had craft day one afternoon and I used scrapbook paper and some cheap Ikea frames to make the little ""art"" collection that hangs near the window.  And one of my favorite prints I own, though you can't see much of it because of the glare, is from the Eagle Rock Art Guild's Sidewalk Art Festival in Idaho Falls.  We bought it the first time we took Rory home to IF to meet the family, including my Grandma Coy, who passed away a few months later.

The rest of my office has the stuff lots of other people have, the obligatory college diploma hanging, pictures of an adorable hubby and kids, and a small collection of awesome kiddo artwork.  I have too much stuff in here, though, and some of it needs to go!  

Have you guys seen any other bloggers doing that challenge where they vow to get rid of 111 things in 1/11?  I could do that at home AND at work. Maybe I'll do that.

Oh, hi.  Remember me?  I'm sorry for dropping off the face of the posting planet.  Sure, I comment plenty on the posts of others, and I often think of things that would make a great post.  But by the time I get around to it, the moment seems to have passed or becomes what I think others would consider irrelevant.  Maybe it's a pity party?  I don't know.  Probably.  Yep, it is.

It's hard to believe this blog is 10 years old.  It certainly has had it's ebbs and flows, and maybe part of why I haven't posted for so long is that I feel like maybe I've outgrown the name I gave this blog when I made it so long ago.  Nillyroo.  An old IRC nickname.  I don't IRC anymore, but I feel like part of me is hanging on to this because it's where I met my hubby over 16 years ago.  Aww.  Sentimental.  Anyone need a tissue?  So, do I keep this blog?  Do I get a new one?  I just don't know.  What kind of name would I give a new blog?  Would anyone read it?  Do I really care?  I guess I do.  So, I'll just resume posting here until I come up with some kind of resolution.  So, welcome back!

My dear friend EH posted a list of topics on her blog the other day, and it's the perfect thing to get me back to blogging - 30 topics in 30 days.  See below:

1. Your workspace
2. The best part of your day
3. Something you refuse to do
4. The last book you read
5. Meaning behind your blog name
6. Talent you wish you had
7. A photo of you without make up (OMG!)
8. Last item you purchased
9. Something that makes you sad
10. 15 facts about you
11. Your favorite thing right now
12. Best Christmas present you ever got
13. Your favorite teacher
14. Something you're thankful for
15. A photo from your childhood
16. Something you crave
17. Your worst hair moment
18. Favorite smell
19. The last time you cried
20. Last time you had to apologize to someone
21. Something that scares you
22. Something that really bugs you
23. What you dislike most about your appearance
24. Celebrity crush
25. A trait you deplore in others
26. A photo taken 10 years ago
27. First book/movie/song that moved you
28. What turns you off
29. The story behind one of your scars
30. Left blank for suggestions!


I'll start tomorrow, when I go back to work.  Seems like the perfect place to provide commentary on my workspace.  I haven't been at work since January 6th (yeah, Florida!), so I need a bit of a refresher before posting.  (Not really, I'm just procrastinating - SO unlike me!)

See you then!"

Jack: Mama, when I'm with my other family, and
Me: Wait, what ""other family""?
Jack: You know, when I get married and stuff
Me: Oh, okay.
Jack: When I'm with my other family, and you miss me, you know I'll always love you.
Me: (choking a little because I didn't want him to see me teary) Thanks buddy, I love you too.
Jack: And if you really miss me, you'll have the black picture book (a small photo album I made in 2006 to take with me when I traveled - then he hijacked it and it's one of his prize possessions) so you can look at me.
Me: Okay.  Hey Jack?
Jack: Yeah?
Me: It doesn't matter how big you get, or who you marry, you will always be my little boy.
Jack: I know.
Me: I know that's goofy, and maybe a little embarrassing, but it's totally true.

*tuck*

Me: Goodnight Buddy.
Jack: Goodnight Mama.
Me: I love you.
Jack: Love you too.

Oh, and P.S. He and Rory like to watch Glee with me.  They play around during the dialogue and then when the singing starts, they stop in their tracks.  Tonight, I was singing along to last night's episode and Jack says ""Mama, maybe <i>you</i> should be on Glee.""  Aww, what a kid!"

Once a week, they have a giveaway.  And, as their website grows in popularity, so does the number of entrants for the contest (this week it was over 4000 entrants!).  But, you can't win if you don't enter!  I learned that this week.

I won!

Orbit White Bubblemint Gum
Argyle
Grilled cheese sandwiches (even better if they have pepperjack cheese in them)
Philosophy holiday-flavored lip glosses, particularly the eggnog latte one

The Nutcracker Suite
Weezer
Minimizer bras
Guster's rendition of <i>Donde Esta Santa Claus?</i> (especially when sung with my kiddos)
14 Hands cabernet sauvignon
Starbucks caramel brulee latte
etsy.com
My charcoal flannel pajama pants with snowflakes and a cute satin drawstring (Gilligan & O'Malley from Target)
Uh, Target (see above, for just one of a million reasons)

Oh, and we got home from work today and a package was waiting for us!  We ordered a Keurig beverage maker - so of course, we had to get it out and set it up immediately.  And it didn't disappoint! I'm enjoying a delicious cup of caribou blend coffee before dinner.

So, yep, my Keurig makes me happy too."

"event","Since we moved to the big city (pop. 925), we have had two Christmas trees; one we keep downstairs for the kids (colored lights, fun pop culture ornaments) and one upstairs for all the grown-up stuff (white lights, glass ornaments).  In that time, I've never had the time or energy to decorate the house the way I really want to.  Sad, I know.  

So, this year, I've decided to just do one tree.  The colored light tree will make its debut in the upstairs living room, and the white light tree will receive a hiatus for this year.  We'll do a combination of fun and grown-up ornaments, and the kids each picked out a box of candy canes (colorful, of course!) when we were shopping yesterday to hang on the tree.  Instead of tons of &quot;don't touch that!&quot; sentiments, the kids will be able to remove a candy cane every couple of days to munch on.  If I were more organized, I'd wrap little advent gifts for them.  But, I think this is a pretty major step for me to admit that I can't do everything I want, and that I'm choosing to embrace the holiday rather than be stressed and disappointed in my shortcomings.

So, I've donned my new Christmas t-shirt I picked up at Target last week.  I'm off to dust and vacuum the living room, and whip up a quick rearrange so we can get this party started!

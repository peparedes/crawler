"event","hey everyone! Well its my 3rd day here now and i am still staying at Victors brothers house. They are the Wang family and they're cool. They feed me lots of weird and tasty foods, try toget me pissed on some weird liquor that frankly tastes rank, and they took me shopping. There supermarkets are just like ours, except i cannot tell what anything is (except the obvious. Lets admit it, a box of eggs is a box of eggs). The family have an 18 year old son called Wang Xin. He has been helping me learn lots of words and noneof them are rude ones. Not like back in britain. The first thing most 18 year olds teach people is words like 'tosser' and fannybucket'. Anyway, Wang Xin is cool. He took me to play badminton in the street and table tennis is a disused warehouse. Last night I went out with him and his mother to Pizza Hut, which was not my choice. The reason we went was so I could meet the lady who has help me set ti his up from day 1, Jane, and a couple of other people who are also involved in varying degrees. There is one irish bloke called Michael who seems pretty cool, one English bloke who is ok (Nigel) and a canadian who seems alright (Chris). If I am honest then I would say that if I was at home in England then I would generally not associate with these people because they are pretty lame but they are good people so lets not 'judge the book by the cover', as the saying goes. Jane and Mary are the two chinese girls who were there and were really nice. They both work in the offices for Victor so I wil be seeing a lot more of them in the coming year. Michael and Nigel go off to another city tomorrow so i wont be seeing much of them.
Anyway, thats enough prattle. I move into my new gaff tomorrow so dont know when ill be online again. All i know is that I am being picked up at 8am. 
Lastly, a traffic update. I have realised that the drivers are all constantly beeping theor horns because if they dont then the hundreds of pedestrians and cyclists that walk wherever they want, wont die. Well at least they have a better chance of survival anyway. Im off to bed. Again ill edit these last few posts later and add photos to the to split these long paragraphs up a bit."

"event","Hello everybody. I have no pictures to add as of yet because I have to get a new memory card and a USB lead thing so you'll just have to wait till you see the wonderous place that I am living in. Besides, first things first...

I enter the country after a gruling 10 hour flight in which i cant sleep and the food is pretty good (for an aeroplane). I touch down in some shiny airport where everything is clean and new looking. From here its all good. I meet a crazy man named Victor, who is 'the guvenor' and a canadian bloke called Chris. From here we start our journey home. 
Now I have been to Amsterdam, and i know a few of you have also. We all know how mad the roads are and how dangerous they can be. well, compared to roads and driving in china, Amsterdam is like a childs play pen. Ok ok, lets start with the basics; Speed limits... check. Speed cameras... check. Road laws... umm, im a bit stuck on this one. At one point we were heading into oncoming traffic with Victor shouting at the other people. This combined with cars speeding around beeping horns indiscriminately at everything and nothing in a vast array of tunes and tones. This, to my horror (cos i thought we would get arrested for it) included a fake police siren which Victor put on so he could clear a path through heavier traffic. I soon found out that only certain cars could have this, which was good because other cars startedblaring away to.
And then we stop to eat. Lets just say, its not like our tasty resturants in the UK kinds! In fact its pretty grim. The home cooked food ive been given tho is brilliant, so why do people pay to eat in resturants? Either way, I'll get used to it. After a week ill be cooking my own food anyway so it'll be fine.
Then I saw my home city. Its not Kingston. I cannot describe what it looks like adaquetly enough to paint a good picture so I wont bother. Ill just say that nothing looks new. I have to admit I was scared as i looked out of that car window, tired and vulnerable, but now I have got used to it and am startingto like where I kive already. Its home so i suppose thats a good thing!
 
To conclude. My initial shock at lifestyle differences and food and culture is over, so now all can be at ease. I dont think anything is going to shock or surprise me after my initial feelings. Anyone that visits me will love it, as im already starting to myself. Please note that I have not spell checked this so ignore mistakes."

So Ill say now to all those whom i wanted to see but never did, that i am sorry but i there was just to much to do and too many of you to see. This whole 2 weeks has been cool but draining. I spent yesterday in bed (which is rare) and now i only have to visit a river to dispose of this one last charge...

As today is Wednesday, that gives me only tonight and thursday night to enjoy. Now if you were me and you had only 2 nights remaining in this country, then what would you do??? One suggestion would be to get police attention because they wont be able to find you if you run away. This is a nice suggestion, but a little risky. Plus i cant think of anything amusing to steal that I could really take advantage of before I went. No no kids, instead of all this silly illegalness, Im simply going to go to a pub and have a nice time

Im gonna be away for a year, during which I will be teaching some kids the subtle nuances of the English language. In reality this means Im gonna talk at a load of confused faces for a few hours a week and get paid for doing it. Whilst this is going on, I will be taking as many opportunities as possible to go look at cool stuff, such as terracotta warriors, big mountains, wonderful countrysides and historical sites dating back over the last 5000 years. All the pictures I will be posting here will be pictures taken by me, and arranged on here for your viewing pleasures. 

But lets be honest, the majority of this will be a write up of what i have been getting up to in my city, who I have met, whats happening, and about all the cultural differences that either make me laugh or drive me mad. I will try and make it as entertaining as I can so you willingly come back and read more about my fun fun life. I leave in 10 days. I will be offline after I leave and dont know exactly when ill be online again or when ill have something interesting to put down so you can all be good people and just check back every now and then, cant you."

I would like all to note that this is a picture of french brie. I, on the other habd am enjoying a nice creamy Somerset brie. And jacobs crackers reverse the effects that brie has on your dreams so its gonna be a nice restful sleep for me tonight. Im glad we cleared that up.
Anyway, I have just arrived back from Joanna's home. it was a lovely evening. You go somewhere to pick something up, you end up leaving after having a cup of tea, a swim and a lovely cloud clearing chat. I now feel very good. Wonderful. And so to tomorrow... Tomorrow I will be waking up, going swimming for 8am, going first to Principles to swap mums coat, then to PC World to slap the manager about my shabby service and shite PC and repairs they have subjected me to. I then proceed home to put on lovley clothes so that I may go to the chinese embassy and obtain a lovely Visa for the duration of my stay in their country. moving swiftly on, I then go meet my freind Miss Nicola whom i have not seen in around 3 years! That should be cool. Then ill go home to cook and eat a curry (which i may make after swimming, who knows).
Now that you have read my plan for the day, you may as well leave me alone and go to bed. OR you could find many ways to pick holes in my abnormally organised day which, of course, wont work out like it is written. If (If) I do get to swimming then it will most likely be at half 8 and the session finishes at 9 so will be a tad pants value for money. Then ill go to Principles, be refused an exchange and then go to PC World and discover that im particularly crap at arguing because at the end of the day, im just not very confrontational. Ill then go home and go online and forget the time and have to go to the Chinese embassy another day because i got dressed to late, hence meaning i wont be in London to meet miss nicola and will have to wait another 3 years before I see her again. Hurrah for standards! I need to tady my room and do some washing to. i think ill cook the curry while its on. Curry is best served the day after cos the flavours mix and the spices combine. Something like that anyway. The politics of curry is to much for me. It gets rather complex and looks something like this...

Not that its that interesting but woah people... this whole China thing has gone mad now. Everywhere I go Im getting asked about it and it seems to be all i am able to talk about accordingly. It doesn't help that im excited and perfectly willing to tell whoever asks all about it. I have so much to prepare tho! Its all getting silly. I've got lots of stuff to get rid of so if anyone wants some clothes before i take them to the charity shop then just say ""hey George, I would like to see soem of those lovely clothes that you are giving away like a true charity promoter king. oh look! You have lots of clothes that you bought and never wore! That was a waste of money wasnt it."" I took loads of videos the other day. Its a dead technology so i had no trouble giving them away.

I do not cope to well with sleeping in the day. I have no trouble sleeping, oh no. Its the eating. When am I supposed to eat when you bet at 10am and then get up at 5. Do I have dinner when I get up or do I have breakfast?

OR

Not that I would personally eat either of these dishes. The look a bit rank to be honest. The breakfast is just a power tool for the hands of the Heartattack Monster. The other just looks a little suspicious.
Tell you what, now Christmas is over Im going to have to lose weight. I know I normally say this sort of shite but i mean healthier than ever dieting. A diet where I dont eat much less, but it healthier and i will re-start my exersise schedule in the New Year, hence complimenting each other so i can feel good inside and out. Its a nice feeling and I miss it. I wonder how many people in the world know this feeling that I am attempting to conveying to you. Most people are so lazy that they wouldnt know the feeling in the first place. Except maybe in childhood, but then they would have forgotten the feeling along with all the other memories of their youth.

Anyway, i should shuffle up to my bed to mull over this crypic thought until I forget about it and just fall asleep. Way to have an interesting day, innit"

Thats not to say I dont have a couple of annoying night shifts but at least i can look at it positively. Christmas is gonna be nice. 4 days of relaxing with a family I rarely see. Im feeling quite proud of my present buying this year. I think Ive done pretty well. Its my turn to actually have the money for a change! Plus I know I wont be around next year because the Chinese dont celebate like we do in the ""west"". Christmas is also the only time of year I get to eat some of this...

Hopefully my own piece will wait patiently for cream rather than having someone pour it whiles it still complete. Some people call it decoration. I call it tainted.

Another part of christmas (which we have already touched upon) is food. not so much food as the way I eat food and what i eat. Normally i waife around looking skinny and eating good and healthy meals with generally few carbs in my diet. At Christmas every year, i eat a shit load and all of it stuff i would normally turn my nose up at. This time of year is fine for eating lots tho. January is the designated 'start exersise' period of every year. I did well for about 8/9 months this year but then got sloppy cos of work and general not being arsed. I need to start again tho. i feel so much worse physically and know i need to get back into the exersise. ive even eaten more then one McDonalds this month and thats just wrong. Ill look this this again if im not careful...

I was looking at the weather there. It apparently has a 'continental monsoon' climate, -16 to -3 in January, 25-27 in July. All of the rain is in summer. I would hazard a guess that its in the form of monsoons. How continental.

Im have to admit (and Im sure that you can tell) that Im getting quite excited now. Now unlike when I went to Amsterdam, i am aware that life is not always as we plan it and I assure you I wont be as nieve as on my last venture but still, I hope its good. For those of you that dont know, Im going to teach English there for a year! I cant say whats going to happen after that because who knows what life will throw at me in that next year. A wife, a car, a death, a cat... could be anything! What it will definately be is a learning curve in life and an experience that i can look back on, be it good or ill. I will make friends, enemies, aquaintences and maybe even children! (Unlikely. This is China remember. The government will have me assasinated if I do that). Saying that, i will be teaching children up to the age of 16 so I will be surrounded by kids everyday. A thrilling prospect if kids were not such bastards. This is not London tho. Surely the world outside of Britain has better kids than we do."

On the sports side we have decided to start training for Triathlons. Its all good because im the swimmer so I can set his training, while he is the runner and the training vise versa. Then we start adding light land training and, once bikes are aquired then were away! Ive got to do it, even if he dont stick to it.
On another note, I got lots of compliments at work about how much younger I look without my glasses :) A single good thing about loosing my glasses. It would have been easier obviously to have just taken them off and left them at home. They cost to much to lose and not feel like a pillock.

A LESSON FOR YOU ALL! DONT DRINK and go landscape painting. I wonder if I was mugged? I dont feel hurt but its possible i suppose. I still have everything on me.

"event","It is October 28th (never mind what the date on the post says) which means a month ago a good man left this earth for the next plain. That man was my dad. 

Like every person that lives on 'borrowed time' his death was sudden but not horrible. He woke up that morning and had his usual cup of coffee and then he went to sleep for a couple more minutes but there was no alarm that could wake him from that kind of sleep. He died on his sleep and he got to drink his cup of coffee (so at least when he went he wasn't cranky).

My dad was a good man, but a man all the same. He wasn't perfect or nowhere near. He was 54 years old, had been married to my mom for 30 something of those 54 years and during that long marriage, which had its ups and downs like any other marriage, he had us. My two older sisters and me. Even though he never said it to us mom did told us that he would tell her he was very proud of us.

He was a man that loved his work, he loved planes and loved keeping people safe. His favorite thing to do on weekends was go out on his motorbike with mom riding behind him and that is how I will forever remember him. Him waiting for mom in the driveway, dressed in jeans, a t-shirt, boots and his helmet...and then mom walking over with an outfit matching his in color and the same matching helmet. They would be gone all day and arrive at night, soaking wet from the rain but so very happy.

I will remember him in many things. Whenever I see a firetruck, a plane or a firefighter. When the sirens of the firetrucks mourn loudly as they head towards a fire. Whenever I ask for my favorite meal at a restaurant, (which he memorized so he could surprise me when he brought it home without me asking for it) but mostly whenever I play pool. Because that was something we didn't get to do before he left.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ A Fire-fighter's Prayer~

When I'm called to duty God
wherever flames may rage
give me strength to save a life
whatever be its age
 

Help me to embrace a little child
before it is too late
or save an older person from
the horror of that fate
 

Enable me to be alert
to hear the weakest shout
and quickly and efficiently
to put the fire out
 

I want to fill my calling and
to give the best in me
to guard my neighbor and
protect his property
 

And if according to your will
I have to lose my life
bless with your protecting hand
my children and my wife.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In loving memory of a true hero.

"event","Here I am again...Though I wish I was sleeping! If anyone was unsure I lived in the country this 'tale' is going to give them a pretty good idea of how far in the country I live! My parents house has a lot of terrain to it, which I like, however like any other house with terrain in the middle of a freaking mountain we get our share of unwanted visitors. (And NO I don't mean the kind that walks in two legs...though those we do get occasionally!)

After having crazy dreams and sleepless periods during the night the barking of the dogs got to me around 4 AM. (That's another story, we have 6 dogs on this property) They were barking their little heads off and of course my paranoia had to kick in because like I said I was having weird dreams so I thought maybe someone was trying to break in into the house. (HA! Silly me) Got up..Put up my regular house clothes, in case I needed to swing my aluminum baseball bat at the attacker I at LEAST had to be dressed...an hour went by, and the dogs were still barking, I had already smoked 2 ciggies waiting for whatever it was to show itself and then Epiphany! (Insert Huge fanfare here!) A loud metallic clomp on the drive way!  By this time my mom had already woken up (early riser...or sleepless, whatever you wanna call it) and we both head for the kitchen to look out the window. At 5 in the morning its still dark as hell so we turn on the lights...we see nothing...Again another metallic clomp. I have heard that sound before..what is it...? I ask myself and then another epiphany! (Apparently you can have more than one every day)

""Do we have a horse?"" I ask my mom, undoing all of the bolts and locks of the door, peeking out...""YUP, we have a horse!""

Somehow my mother had forgotten to tell me that one of the neighbors horses liked to drop by unannounced at really early hours of the morning to munch on the grass at our garden. (What can I say, since dad died in September not a lot of yard work  has been done) And that was exactly what it was doing, munching on the grass by the window of the room I'm staying in... WTF? Who exactly forgot to send me that freaking memo? True, it was a cute horse, very healthy looking...but still a horse! By MY WINDOW!!! AT FREAKING 4 AM IN THE MORNING!!!!!!!! Don't get me wrong...I like horses, I do...but I like sleeping even more."

"event","I've had this live journal thing for a while but I never found a reason to begin writing in my journal. Why? Well, its very simple. I've never been able to keep a journal in my whole life and I fear that this one wont be any different. Sure, ill post from time to time but to do so every day I know its not gonna happen. I don't have enough things going on in my life to post every single day so there.

Stay tuned."

"event","...completely different.  Okay so if you've been following this sketchblog since it started in 2005, you've seen sketches, doodles, works in progress, and whatever is the end result of putting pencil or pen to paper.  But never once, photos...I'm about to change that, right now.  So you've seen the end result of working on art right? Well now let's take a look at the things that are <i>used</i> to make said art...

<lj-cut text=""Only the poor workman blames his tools..."">


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/bamboo.jpg"" />

My tablet!  Can't get much digital art done without it!  Well you can with a <b>mouse</b> but seeing as I don't have the coordination(lol left handed!...I use this.  Now this tablet was a gift from Christmas '07!


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/blacksketchbook.jpg"" />

So instead of wasting all the printer paper in the house, enter one of my two sketchbooks and epic electric eraser.  This black one is for all the detailed stuff, and the sketch you see is of <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com/art/original/yuletide.jpg""><b>this</b></a>.



<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/clipboard.jpg"" />

And for those moments when some printer paper has been <strike>stolen</strike> borrowed, we have the clipboard of doom!  Actually this is really handy, it has this little compartment for holding pens, paper, candy...all the tools for an artist.


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/computar.jpg"" />

Ladies and gentlemen, you CANNOT CREATE DIGITAL ART WITHOUT A COMPUTER!  Do not believe what anyone has told you, for computers=digital and that is all you need to know!  Yeah...darn people, telling me I can make digital art without a computer, damn them...DAMN THEM TO HELL!!!!!!  And the wallpaper seen here is <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com/goodies/downloads/wallpapers/sh%5B1024x768%5D.jpg""><b>this</b></a> made by yours truly!


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/electriceraser.jpg"" />

Oh man I love this thing! I've read about people using electric erasers and one day I managed to pop into an art supply store(as I have a tendency to do, also with game, book and computer stores), saw they had one eraser in stock and bam!  I bough it, sketching has never been the same since...And here's the <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/Art%20stuff/Eraser%20box.jpg""><b>box it</b></a> came in :P!


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/markers.jpg"" />

The markers I NEVER USE...but I want to use them.  Thing is, I'm <i>afraid</i> to use them.  Unlike with photoshop/painter/openCanvas/paint tool SAI/  traditional media has NO UNDO BUTTON...but I guess the only way I'll get half descent at using them is to practise, so someone over the summer, poke me on MSN or AIM and say ""LEAH GO USE UR MARKERZ NAO PLZKTHX!"".  The copics I got at last year's Anime North, and hope to get some more and the Prismacolors were a christmas present in 2005, need to rebuy certain shades and get more fleshtones.


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/tablet.jpg"" />

And here we see the tablet in use, with the smudgeguard.  Yes my nails are naturally long, and I love me my french manicures.  Also, LOL LEFT HANDER!


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/whitesketchbook.jpg"" />

My other sketchbook, the sketchbook for anatomy practise and random ideas :P.  And behold...I like drawing bald characters!


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/ipod.jpg"" />

I find I'm able to work a lot better with a little music...and cleaning supplies apparently...


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/photos/artstuff/pencilcase.jpg"" />

My pencils let me show you them. Also have a couple erasers and junk in there.
</lj-cut>

Alright you've seen what I work with, now it's work in progress time!


<lj-cut text=""An idea that will lead to something...I hope."">


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/art/wips/randomlayout.jpg"" />

My next <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com""><b>website</b></a> layout, I want to have an area for wip screenshots and one for recent gallery updates, hence the little boxes on the left hand side.  Then I looked at what I had made and said, ""You know...lemme make something at actually features something I've <b>drawn</b>!""  So I'll try and doodle up something when I have free time.
</lj-cut>


And last but not least...

<lj-cut text=""I will finish these before I turn 30...or die trying."">


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/art/wips/texturedaristocrat.jpg"" />

Guess who learned about the wonderful world of textures?  Why does shading clothing take so long? Also would someone like to teach me how to shade clothes? No really...*headdesk*.


<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/art/wips/shadeddiablo.jpg"" />

MOAR TEXTUREZ!  Also, I'm tacking a crack at a little pencil lineart, wish me luck!
</lj-cut>

And here you have it, want to finish at least one of those images and then finally work on some gift art I owe people, all while trying to not be driven insane by school and my oh so non stress inducing job D:!  So that's it for now, more to come hopefully soon!

"event","What a fitting name, I really wish I had more time to update this blog, I almost debate whether or not to make my sketch/wip posts over at my new <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com""><b>site</b>'s blog <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blog""><b>section</b></a>...but for me to do that, I would actually need to have FREE TIME to work on new art and things like that >_> and also, still love livejournal and this little blog*squeeze*.  But anyways, I'll save my rants about my lovely job for <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou"">, now is a time for ART!  So it's been a little while since my last post and I'm sure you're wondering what I've been up to artistically. Well I launched my site on <b>November 25th</b> and I'm quite proud of that, seeing an idea and a dream come to reality always feels good...

<lj-cut text=""Splash! All the cool sites have splash images.."">

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/advertise2.jpg"">

Yup this little bit of chibi was one of the first pieces of art you would see when you enter the site.  To date it was one of the fastest pieces of cg art I've made, 7, 8 hours of <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/riiachan.jpg""><b>inking</b></a> in painter, while SICK(usually takes me upwards of 10 and 12 hours-must be a sign I'm getting the hang of digital inking), and 6 hours to cel-shade it in photoshop...why was I using the pen tool to shade before XD?  I really need to try regular sized cel-shaded characters.  Man, just looking at this, if I had the time, I'm tempted to resurrect my gaia <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/925s7d""><b>art shop</b></a> or see how I'd fare in one of those art auctions cause I really want both the angelic and nitemare mini wings, then I can die a happy gaian XD!
</lj-cut>

So in deviantart, I wanted a new avatar to replace the one I had for halloween...you know what happened next...

<lj-cut text=""This aint yo' grandma's photoshop son!"">

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/pixelgin3.gif""/>

So I've been making making <i>really simple</i> looking pixel avatars right? Well the thing that got me into making the avatars was <a href=""http://rhu.deviantart.com/gallery/#icons""><b>this gallery</b></a>.  Loved Rhu's artstyle for some time and those avatars are adorable ;___;!  So I always tried making on with little success.  Problem was, I kept putting in too much detail and after all, it's a 50x50 picture so it can't be as detailed as a full cg.  So one day, while reading through tutorials and getting pointers from <lj user=""xarpiex"">, this is the end result.  Now that I know to make a <b>rough sketch</b>, then outline with the line too...I gotta try making more and better ones, featuring my oc's and stuff.
</lj-cut> 

So I had my site going for a little while, and every time I looked at it, I wasn't too happy.  For one I tried using Dreamweaver's template option to quickly make my pages.  Now I'm not sure if it's because I FAIL or am a n00b at making sites still, but everytime a section would load, the images that would make up the layout would take their sweet time to show up.  That and the simpleness of the layout made me decide for a change...

<lj-cut text=""They say inspiration comes from many places.  For me it was a tutorial..."">

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/csstest.jpg""/>

So like the cut title says, you can get inspiration from anywhere and for me, it was a <a href=""http://psdlearning.com/2008/08/carbon-fiber-layout/""><b>tutorial</b></a>.  I really liked the background, so I whipped up a psd file, made the background and the container sections.  After that, I went with my own thing.  With this layout, I said GTFO with dreamweaver templates and following tutorials only from <a href=""http://www.tutvid.com/""><b>Tutvid</b></a>(good beginner tutorials but I do know something about webdesign) and decided to apply what I know about CSS.

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/carbonfiber.jpg""/>

Don't know why I was having a hard time slicing this...oh right, it was my second time slicing a layout to export it to dreamweaver. Oh well, I learn something new each time I play around with this, and big thanks to my buddy Maria for showing me how this <i>should</i> be sliced, cause we both know, if left to my own devices, I would have had over 9000 slices D:!
</lj-cut>


With slices ready, css files written, it was time to rebuild tranquil solace, and the first thing up was the index page...

<lj-cut text=""WEB COUNTER GOES HURR!"">

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/splashpreview.jpg"">

Sometimes it's nice to remind yourself where to put your webcounter :P! So after about 2 and a half days of formatting and recoding, I give you the end result...

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/layoutversions/ts2.jpg""/>

So nice being able to use 200x40 banners instead of tiny ones for everything.  If you want to see the layout in action, GO TO MY SITE :P!  Man I really need to start pimping out the place...
</lj-cut>

So while working on that, Christmas came and went....

<lj-cut text=""Season's greetings everyone!"">

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/seasonsgreetings.jpg""/>

Note to self: It's ""season's"" not ""season"" and making snowmen is fun :3!

<img src=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blogimages/seasonsavi.jpg""/>
</lj-cut>

Hopefully this makes up for my little abscence, as always, forgive me :(.  In the mean time, enjoy the artistic goodies for that's all for now!

"event","Boy oh boy, it seems like there's never enough time to work on anything anymore.  And any free time I do have feels like precious stolen moments...good grief, I need another job, just check the <b>friends locked</b> entries over at <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou"">. But I shall worry about my job woes later, for now, I give you ART!

<lj-cut text=""With each page, I am closer to completion!"">

<img src=""http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/5557/ap2vr4.jpg""/>

My little ""about"" section and what you see here, prominently displayed, is a little thank you to all the people who have helped and inspired me to draw.  Hopefully you can make out the text, if not, I'll type it all out.  It's worth reading :D.

<img src=""http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/4098/dashesae0.jpg""/>

Then I wanted a little dotted line/dashes separating eatch section of the faq and about sections, so here they are.

<img src=""http://img296.imageshack.us/img296/1686/faqscreenoe4.jpg""/>

And no site is complete without some sort of FAQ section, so here's mine :P!
</lj-cut>

So help me God I will get this site finished, come hell or high water.  I'd say I'm about 60-70% done(maybe) unless I see or read about some kind of feature that I want to put in.  Sometimes, I hate being a perfectionist...


So one one of the nights that I wasn't plagued by work, I picked up the sketchbook, with the intension of...

<lj-cut text=""Making a little something for halloween!"">

<img src=""http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/2446/diablosketchjn8.jpg""/>

Now I've seen quite a few artists, including Mr. Hyung Tae Kim who would use clean PENCIL sketches for their lineart, after a little playing around in photoshop and the like.  And I'm certain doing this will speed up the time it takes for me to cg stuff, at least I want to try it, as one cannot rely on one method of doing things.  And if it works, I can say I can ink with pens, digitally and with...pencils :P. It was fun to draw and some how I ended up putting in a whole lot of satanic symbols here and there o___o.  But I'll try drawing this over again since there are a few anatomical errors, maybe I'll colour both pics, who knows with me!
</lj-cut>

So I'm part of a certain <a href=""http://fuzzro.co.nr""><b>RO server</b></a>, hell I GM on that certain server.  And yesterday, I felt the need for a change in my forum avatar and signature...so...

<lj-cut text=""Old things made new again."">

<img src=""http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/57/matsuavie2xs9.jpg""/>

So here we have the avatar.  At first it had only a <a href=""http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/6720/matsuaviect8.jpg""/><b>white border</b></a> but that just blended in with the forum's colour scheme, so had to make it over again D:!

<img src=""http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/3414/matsusiggykd1.jpg""/>

And a matching forum signature.  It's amazing what you can do with a little <a href=""http://img261.imageshack.us/img261/6137/hpmatsusepiapsduy6.jpg""/><b>old</b></a> artwork.
</lj-cut>

Also that same server is going to be hosting a RO2 server and as such we have a special forum for Ragnarok Online 2...

<lj-cut text=""More avatars than you can shake a stick at!"">

<img src=""http://img91.imageshack.us/img91/9246/aristocrataviezt0.jpg""/>

Yeah an avie of the partially finished <a href=""http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/3094/aristocraticwip4tb4.jpg""/><b>work in progress</b></a>!  Tried uploading a <a href=""http://img357.imageshack.us/img357/549/aristocratavie2yr8.png""/><b>png version</b></a> with no luck, but that's okay, the colour quality of jpegs is usually better :P!
</lj-cut>

So that's all the art for now, I should go work on something, so see you!

And I need to get on to that, even more so with the purchase of <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com""><b>tranquil solace</b></a>.  So in between coding and designing the other pages, here's some art that will be featured on my various art hangouts...

<lj-cut text=""Every piece has its place!"">

<img alt="""" src=""http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/2074/wipsblogversiontw7.jpg"" />

Trying to have a few images that you'd only find on the site.  I might even finish off some older(and not too hideous) looking cg's and post them too :D.  Heck I have a few <a href=""http://img261.imageshack.us/img261/6137/hpmatsusepiapsduy6.jpg""><b>ragnarok</b></a> online pictures that I liked.  And some that I need to be <a href=""http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/23/wipro9.jpg""><b>finished</b></a>.  So we'll see how things go!
</lj-cut> 

A small update, but hopefully it's a worthwhile one, so that's all for now!

"event","Good grief, it's been about a month and a little bit since I've updated this.  My only excuse is my overly demanding job that leaves me with little to no quiet time.  And with the little quiet time I have, I'm way to tired to do anything artsy.  But luckily, according to my schedule I'll have more time at home and I'm hoping and praying I'm not called during the week because having a life is a <i>little</i>(read A LOT) more important than Walmart and their low, low prices.  And now for the artwork!

<lj-cut text=""Care to drop me a line?"">
<img src=""http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/2436/mailsentkz1.gif""/>

So like all the cool people with personal webpages, mine will have a contact form(to email me) when finished. So while googling on how to make a contact form, I came across a <a href=""http://www.thesitewizard.com/wizards/feedbackform.shtml""><b>free</b></a> php script.  And part of the script calls for a ""thank you"" page when the mail message goes through and an error one...so here we have a happy little envelope that's being sent to my inbox 8D!


<img src=""http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/3426/fancymailct0.gif""/>

This is what happens when you get new photoshop brushes :P!

<img src=""http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/7901/mailnotsentyn1.gif""/>

If you're the unlucky soul who manages to mess up on filling out a REALLY simple email form, you're gonna get this D:!
</lj-cut>

Still have a lot to type out for each page, but I'll get it done!  Even if they have to drag my dead body from the pc, I'll do it! Moving along, with all the pages that need to be typed and <b>artwork</b> that needs to be <b>watermarked</b> and uploaded to a <b>gallery</b> in order for the site to be complete, there needs to be a front page...

<lj-cut text=""Hello, I'm the Artist and I'll be your site host this evening..."">

<img src=""http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/6381/riiachibilx5.jpg""/>

I've noticed something!  A lot of the artists I admire have some sort of mascot. Bara-chan has her gorgeous artwork of her ragnarok online <a href=""http://www.barachan.com/art/color/""/><b>characters</b></a>.  Kaze-hime has <a href=""http://kaze-hime.deviantart.com/art/Holly-the-Bunny-83634717""/><b>Holly Bunny</b></a> and rabbits in general(dammit why didn't I think of that? I love rabbits!!), Finni has her digimon OC Finnimon and this adorable <a href=""http://finni.deviantart.com/art/Happy-Holidays-o6-45233722""><b>girl</b></a> and the list goes on...so what does Leah have?  Well she has original characters*cough*Gin,Yasu,Tama,Cain, athropomorphic vector fruit, graphic tablets or whatever I think of vectoring and also...chariactures of myself!  For you see, I've been drawing anime <a href=""http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/2774/lmfbluefj4.jpg""/><b>versions</b></a> of myself and characters that are <a href=""http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/4237/chibiartistartblogzi1.jpg""><b>related</b></a> to me for some <a href=""http://static.flickr.com/28/97755065_32e8aaeaf2_b.jpg""/><b>time</b></a> now.  So there you have it, the site mascot is the Artist herself.  Oh and I learned that those lovely people in Japan pronounce the name ""Leah"" as ""<a href=""http://www.japanesetranslator.co.uk/your-name-in-japanese/?forename=Leah&style=5""/><b>Riia</b></a>"" and not as ""Reafu"" as I've been wrongly saying for the past 13 years(remember kids, wapanese, bad name generators and wanting to sound so informed don't mix...but it's hard to get rid of old screen names). Oh and two things, it's ""Lee-ah"" not ""Lay-uh"", and no those aren't dreadlocks, they are hair twists :P!  That reminds me...I need to microbraid my hair XD!
</lj-cut>

And there you have it, here's hoping I get this site up and running and finish all the wip's I have sitting on my hard drive.  So that's all for now!

"event","Fate has smilled upon me, for I have a short work week YAY!  So with this extra time, I intend to finish my <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com""><b>site</b></a>, it really shouldn't take that long especially with <b>Dreamweaver</b> doing the actual coding ""work"" and <a href=""http://tutvid.com/""><b>this site</b></a> providing some amazing photoshop and dreamweaver tutorials.  Then all that's left is to make the gallery and decide on an important question: To watermark ot not to watermark?  Don't think my cg art and vector images are worth stealing, but I sometimes wonder and once I read this really nice comment on a friend's journal saying that when you sign a piece of artwork or put your name on it somehow, you're claiming it as your own, and showing the world you're proud of it.  And I am happy of come this far, knowing how I started out, so we'll see...And now, for the art people!

<lj-cut text=""Adobe Illustrator is a vector based drawing program..."">

<img src=""http://img103.imageshack.us/img103/286/illustratorpractiseyt8.jpg""/>

So I followed a <a href=""http://milkbun.deviantart.com/art/Illustrator-Shapes-Tutorial-86275997""/><b>tutorial</b></a> and you know what...I don't like the program .___.!  Perhaps because I've become so used to making my vectors in photoshop with the pen/shape tools, gradients and a whole lot of mouse clicking.  But I should definitely give Illustrator a try and see if I can come up with some of the really cute and abstract designs I've seen on the internet, bilboards, clothing, bags...WHY IS IT I GET IDEAS FROM <B>EVERYTHING</B> AROUND ME DX!
</lj-cut>

So continuing with the desire to finish my site quickly, I decided to work on something easy: website link buttons!  So looking at <a href=""http://ashen-ray.com""><b>Ashen Ray</b></a> and <a href=""http://lillymon.net""><b>[escape]</b></a>(two personal favourite artsites by people on deviantart :3) for the standard dimensions for said buttons, I booted up photoshop and went to work!

A few <b>200x40</b> buttons featuring older cg's I've made(which you can find here if you just look or at my <a href=""http://utena-tenjou10.deviantart.com""><b>deviantArt</b></a> page)!

And some <b>88x31</b> buttons using simple gradients!  I think I'll use the gray one for deviantArt and signatures.  Now to get to the job of coding the site :P!

"event","So I've been writing about it for a little while now at <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou"">, but I'm making  a personal <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com""><b>webpage</b></a>.  Right now, there's only that ""Under construction"" image and a <a href=""http://tranquil-solace.com/blog""><b>blog</b></a> page, but of course I can't leave it like that forever, art has to go there and other things.  But most importantly...

<lj-cut text=""Every site needs a layout..."">

<img src=""http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/8940/tryingtomakeawebsite5bd3.jpg""/>

I had a <a href=""http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/8345/tryingtomakeawebsite4ad0.jpg""><b>previous</b></a> design but because of a few problems with the positioning of the pencil and <strike>my stupidity</strike> other unforseen issues, had to make a new layout...And to make the sheets of paper look more authentic, I added those 3ring binder holes.
</lj-cut>

Then after a little layout slicing and optimization in photoshop, said layout had to be taken to dreamweaver.  It was a loooong process.  Riddled with deleting of files, remaking things, cussing, staring at a blank screen and something, screaming.  But in the end, I finally had something, thanks to a certain <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=lEjLciNRC8s""><b>tutorial</b></a>.  And here's...

<lj-cut text=""The finished product!"">

<img src=""http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/9412/completedtemplateyv0.jpg""/>

Now I need to figure out how to make the backgroud of the div(the spot where it says main content area and the google link) line up with the rest of the lined paper boxes so that it's smoother looking.  But hey this is my first website layout and I've done it all on my own, I can be a <i>little</i> proud right?
</lj-cut>

Now websites aren't just about pretty graphics, as you know, there's also coding...

<lj-cut text=""100 plus lines of coding to be exact!"">

<img src=""http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/7374/codesbs4.jpg""/>

When the website idea first came into my head, I thought that if I made something really simple, I could type something out in notepad, but with dreamweaver everything is incredibly simple(there's even a little button you can press they checks for any errors in coding and any potention problems there can be with different web browsers).  Can you imagine yourself having to type out 102 lines of HTML coding, I love that kind of stuff but no thank you!
</lj-cut>


So there you have it, hopefully I'll have everything up and running soon, so that I can go back to actual drawing(after all, if this is to be an online gallery, I need some ART).  So that's all for the time being!

Just a small update but hopefully worth while.  For that's all for now!

"event","No I have no forgotten this humble little art/sketch/graphics blog, just final exams and school were sapping a major part of my free time.  But now, I'm out of school and it's back to business.  So what have I been up to artistically?  Well let's take a look shall we?

<lj-cut text=""Multiple steps, multiple tries and one layout!"">

<img src=""http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/5327/nightskyljheaderpreviewoz7.jpg/"">

First I wanted a <a href=""http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/680/nightskyheadervd6.jpg/""><b>night sky</b></a> themed image.  I even had a background <a href=""http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/5156/nightskybgug9.jpg/""><b>tile</b></a> image to go with it.  But after looking at it for a while, I stopped liking it and wanted a longer header.  So let's take 2! 

<img src=""http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/9278/sunnydayzljheaderpreviefg6.jpg/"">

Enter the happy and <a href=""http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/4936/sunnydayzljheaderzk3.jpg""/><b>sunny</b></a> header!  Inspired by my deviantArt <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/15929.html#cutid3""/><b>CSS</b></a> layout.  And who doesn't like a bright and warm looking image for the summer?  If only the weather outside was equally as bright!

<img src=""http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/1117/sunnydayzbgimageve9.jpg""/>

Of course livejournal layouts need background images and here is mine.  Also I learned how to play with the layer mask function in order to make this*learns something new each day*!

<img src=""http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/513/sunnydayzljiconxq4.jpg""/>

Also you need default avatars for said layout!

<img src=""http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/3387/sunnydayzfriendsonlybanug1.gif""/><img src=""http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/2873/sunnydayzlockedentrybanvd9.gif""/>

My semi-friends only and locked entry banners.  Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't just lock my journal all together but, I dunno...I like making my banners :P!
</lj-cut>

And when you put this all together, what do you get?  Well you get <a href=""http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/7138/sunnydayzscreenshotsnm0.jpg""/><b>this</b></a>! Want a live preview?  Head on over to <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou"">!  And past livejournal layouts can be seen <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/18534.html""/><b>here</b></a>!!

And now that layout showcase is out of the way, it's time for some vector artwork!

<lj-cut text=""Now I sit and collect dust, alone and forgotten.  Like a lover spurned..."">

<img src=""http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/4785/graphire3chanki0.jpg""/>


Going along the same lines as <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/15722.html#cutid1""/><b>this</b></a> image.  I want to try making little images of all my favourite electronic gadgets.
</lj-cut>

And now for a little shameless self promotion...

<lj-cut text=""A little header for a little auction!"">

<img src=""http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/6745/gaiaauctionheaderbj2.png""/>

Yup!  A friend of mine and I are doing a little gaiaonline <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/5gzgop""><b>art</b></a> auction.  Go check it out, <strike>I need</strike> we need pretend money to buy pretend mini wings XD!
</lj-cut> 

And that's it for now!  I have actual <b>anime</b> pictures that are being inked and coloured(no I haven't stopped drawing anime :P). So expect a wave of those large eyed-brightly coloured, big haired characters that come from Japan soon.  But this is all for now.

<lj-cut text=""A little something..."">

<img src=""http://img376.imageshack.us/img376/8742/kafracolourzlt6.jpg""/>

A good <a href=""http://www.levenn.deviantart.com""/><b>friend</b></a> of mine gave me some lineart to colour so that she could put the artwork on her ragnarok online server's website. Always wondered what my crazy pentool cel-shading looks like on non-chibi people.  She likes how it's coming so far, so that makes me happy :3.  Maybe I should brush off and finish some of my <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/tag/ragnarokonline""><b>older</b></a> ro fanart for her to put on the site :P?
</lj-cut>   

Also, you know how I've been posting little pixel avatars, ranting and raving about how to make a perfect outline without the extra pixels? Well I think I finally got that problem solved...

<lj-cut text=""Enter the pixels!"">
<img src=""http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/2372/bambootabletsmallce6.gif""/><img src=""http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8012/whiteipodsmallzp8.gif""/><img src=""http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/1300/heartsmalltz7.gif""/>

The first one is supposed to be my tablet, the <b>Wacom Bamboo Fun</b>, medium sized tablet.  The second is a simple <b>iPod</b> and the last, just a heart...I need to learn to shade round things.  Did I forget to mention the little tablet is my current <a href=""http://www.utena-tenjou10.deviantart.com""><b>avatar</b></a>! I should make more for the practise over the summer :3.  Anyone want one?
</lj-cut>

And lastly, but not least, I wanted to change my deviantArt css journal layout so...

<lj-cut text=""Sunny days are here again!"">


<img src=""http://img386.imageshack.us/img386/7186/sunnydayzsmallversionhh3.jpg""/>

Putting my cutesy vector art to good <a href=""http://img396.imageshack.us/img396/6548/sunnydayzbigversionjr3.jpg""/><b>use</b></a>!  I wish there was some kind of ""offical"" journal template people could use, instead of searching for tutorials and wondering how more experienced people get their designs D: *sigh*...in the mean time, enjoy a <a href=""http://www.utena-tenjou10.deviantart.com/journal""><b>live</b></a> preview!
</lj-cut>


That's all for now, good luck with your exams everyone!

"event","Allow me to show you what happens when I do things on a whim.  Even when doing things on a whim it helps to have a little inspiration...so I looked down at my tablet and...


<lj-cut text=""I found a new friend...and it has a BLOODY FACE!"">

<img src=""http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/9805/coderedoq5.jpg""/>

It started off innocently...a red background, trippy looking branches.  

<img src=""http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/4667/codered2os0.jpg""/>

THEN IT GREW A FACE!  My tablet doesn't normally have a face!  It didn't have one when I bought it from the store...y'all have to be careful, tablets be growing faces and saying ""hello"" to you @___@!

<img src=""http://img379.imageshack.us/img379/4272/tabletchantw6.jpg""/>

And before I knew it, my tablet fell in love with me!  It was bound to happen...I spend so much time with him(yes my tablet is male).  He couldn't resist my charms :P!
</lj-cut>

Then yesterday, while looking at my <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/18534.html""><b>current</b></a> livejournal layout, I felt it was time for a change, and to possibly used my developing vectoring skills for a design.  The theme of this layout would be <b>citrus fruits</b>.  So before jumping right into the coding, I have a grand old time making the graphics.  So I needed a little practice in making citrusy fruits, and while making some limes, I learned something very important...

<lj-cut text=""We prevent scurvy!"">

<img src=""http://img376.imageshack.us/img376/4516/limesxz4.jpg""/>

It's true ladies and gentlemen, cirtrusy fruit like limes, do prevent scurvy :D!  So go eat some NOW!  If you get scurvy don't say I didn't warn you! Also, this little picture is available as a deviantArt <a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/print/2973459/""><b>print</b></a> :3!
</lj-cut>

Seeing as my <a href=""http://www.wacom.com/bambootablet/bamboofun.cfm""><b>Wacom Bamboo Fun</b></a> tablet now possesses facial features and apparently, it loves me...it was time for a new dA avatar and another attempt at pixel artwork!

<lj-cut text=""My tablet has a face and it floats!"">

<img src=""http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/7903/littletabletbigoi8.gif""/>

I love how the avatar servers on dA are taking their sweet time in showing <a href=""http://img241.imageshack.us/img241/9665/littletabletsmallut3.gif""/><b>this</b></a> it's really encouraging >_>;;...am I getting any better at these pixel things anyway?
</lj-cut>


With exams around the corner it may be a little while before I update here again, but please stay tuned!  That's all for now!

<img src=""http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/1618/vectororenjiavatarbighl5.gif""/>


Making more pixel avatars of <a href=""http://img352.imageshack.us/img352/3482/orenjiyo7.jpg""/><b>Orenji-chan</b></a>, the happy little orange.  But I didn't like the horrid white bits around it, and it didn't look any better when <a href=""http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/8472/vectororenjiavatarsmalljl8.gif""/><b>shrunk down</b></a>.

Don't like this one either...the caption bubble is cut off and it still isn't as smooth and pixel-y as I'd like.  Any pointers?  I guess my best bet is to read through my bookmarked <a href=""http://del.icio.us/reafu/pixel""/><b>pixel art</b></a> tutorials and keep at it...
</lj-cut>



Still randomly doodling things...I'm taking a sketchbook or bits of printer paper, sitting down and actually drawing things with a shape and form.  Don't want to fall out of practise all together.

<lj-cut text=""The doodles...they never end!"">

<img src=""http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/858/randomdoodles7cx3.jpg""/>

Yeah, I need to draw more people and the things I'm bad at =_=;;!
</lj-cut>


And remember my tale of woe about some bad looking lineart and my desire to colour like <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/15326.html""><b>Hyung Tae Kim</b></a>? Well look at what I've been up to...

<lj-cut text=""You are now entering...THE PAINTER ZONE!"">

<img src=""http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/5302/inkingthearistocratrv9.jpg""/> 

Get a little digital inking practise with Corel Painter :D!
</lj-cut>

And I will learn that colouring style, so help me God D:!


And that's all for now, I have work in the morning -_-...hopefully I'll have something better looking in the works soon...I can't wait for summer so I can draw/ink and colour more ._.!  So that's all for now!

"event","Well I'm on my reading week right now so you know what that means:  Much needed sleep, study and of course <b>art</b>!  And now it's time for me to show off what I've managed to come up with...

<lj-cut text=""I am the rosebride.."">

<img src=""http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/7482/chibianthyly4.jpg""/>

Another RGUtena chibi!  I'm going to attempt to make a series of chibi versions of the main characters of the show.  So to start off we have <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/12967.html#cutid2""/><b>Utena</b></a> and now Anthy.  I have to be honest, cel-shading these things is too much fun :P!
</lj-cut>

And since I was playing with Photoshop's pen tool, you know it could only lead to...

<lj-cut text=""RANDOM INTERNET MEME'S!"">

<img src=""http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/8048/chibianthylulzsw9.jpg""/>

What can I say?  I did it for the lulz :P!  Also...


<img src=""http://img160.imageshack.us/img160/2729/chibianthylulzicon2vx3.jpg""/>

Now in icon form!  You never know when you'll need a lulz icon, but if you do, take a picture that looks right, <a href=""http://img523.imageshack.us/img523/3388/chibianthylulziconlv4.jpg""><b>edit</b></a> it to your liking and you're set!
</lj-cut>

More Utena stuff to come soon!  And now for something a little different.  A good friend of mine, <a href=""http://www.teh-kenji.deviantart.com""><b>Kenji</b></a> and I were in a paintchat Saturday night.  I haven't oekaki-ed anything in quite some time so here's what I have...

<lj-cut text=""I think I may have reached an epiphany!"">

<img src=""http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/9269/epiphanyhu0.jpg""/>

At least I'm <b>FINALLY</b> starting to draw faces in the way I'd want to.  I know the body anatomy isn't perfect, but I did notice something, I wasn't really trying to draw a ""perfect"" body but I came out with something remotely decent.  Maybe if I don't focus so much on things I draw better?  Who knows O_o?!?

<img src=""http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/1235/yasuoekakimy1.jpg""/>

Slapping on some colour is fun :P!  Definitely need to keep drawing and make more strides :D!
</lj-cut>

 And last but not least, I took <lj user=""autovatic"">'s advice and...

<lj-cut text=""MAMMA I CAN ANIMATE NOW!!"">

<img src=""http://img182.imageshack.us/img182/4489/pagbigiw6.gif""/>

Now if you're sharp, you'll notice that this floaty head is from <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/14253.html#cutid6""><b>this</b></a> entry!  Now if only deviantArt would work properly so that I can upload this as my <a href=""http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/2299/pagsmalldg3.gif""><b>user</b></a> avatar >__>;;...dammit work you useless site!  I want to show off my new found skills with <b>Image Ready</b>
</lj-cut>

There you have it, a short and sweet update for you all to enjoy.  That's all for now so until next time!

"event","Wow it's been almost a month since I've updated here, so sorry!  But I have been doing things here and there as always.  And also as always, school and work get in the way -_-! Anywhoo...let's try something different, I'm always showing off sketches and finished pieces correct?  Well this time, I'm going to show off some of my works in progress(wip's) so here we go!

<lj-cut text=""A wallpaper for a new OS!"">

<img src=""http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/9425/thecuteorangeoe0.jpg""/>

Now of course this should look familiar to everyone who's been following this blog :).  This sprouted as a result of me wanting a nice wallpaper for my laptop, if I ever managed to install Windows Vista onto it...I still need to do that *sigh*

<img src=""http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/3850/thecuteorange2an7.jpg""/>

And more detail!
</lj-cut>

Now we don't just take screenshots of wallpaper designs, sometimes we take screenshots of...

NO ARTZ FOR JOO T___T!
</lj-cut>

So as some of you know, I have a <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/62951.html#cutid1""><b>list</b></a> of artistic resolutions.  And some of these art resolutions tie in with my little <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/49245.html#cutid2""><b>dream</b></a>.  One of these resolutions is to make an <b>art website</b>.  Right now, I'm narrowing down my choices for a decent webhost and I want to say a big thank you to <lj user=""soaker87""> and <lj user=""magentia""> for your hosting suggestions, I have no idea where I'd start without them &hearts;!  Anyways..websites need nice backgrounds and graphics correct? Well...

<lj-cut text=""I wandered lonely as a cloud..."">

<img src=""http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/2778/creationofawebbackgrounhe8.jpg""/>

Sort of want a beach, fruity theme at least for a first layout :D.  I give 10 internets to the person who can tell me where that line comes from :)!

<img src=""http://img50.imageshack.us/img50/9382/creationofawebbackgrounbm2.jpg""/>

And MOAR detail :P!

</lj-cut>

Alright so you might be a little tired of the simple vector art, sooo...let me tell you...

<lj-cut text=""I like purple!"">

<img src=""http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/2517/ilikepurplezf6.jpg""/>

Yes I do!  It happens to be my favourite colour too.  Annnd...I happen to like Revolutionary Girl Utena.  Might as well combine the two :P!

<img src=""http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/3415/boomb0.jpg""/>

More detail on the face :D!
</lj-cut>

And that concludes the screenshot portion of this posting!  Onto the more refined things!  One of the places that I was looking into getting a webhosting account going was...<a href=""http://www.surpasshosting.com/""><b>Surpass Hosting</b></a>.  I even went so far as to join their message board and ask a few questions.  You know what happens when I join a message board right?

<lj-cut text=""I need to make those graphics!"">

<img src=""http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/3843/redvectorsurpasshostingqm1.jpg""/>

A little signature image!  I don't know what is up with me and the colour red these days :/!  I didn't like the way this turned out, image quality wise...

<img src=""http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/5858/redvectorsurpasshostingpr7.jpg""/>

So I remade it :P!
</lj-cut>

Also related to the whole website thing...

<lj-cut text=""Under construction!"">

<img src=""http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/9505/orenjiunderconstructionhq1.jpg""/>

Always need to have your under construction picture, and here's the one I'll use(until I make something better).  And being the perfectionist I am, I found a mistake and <a href=""http://img120.imageshack.us/img120/6584/orenjiunderconstructionyu6.jpg""><b>made</b></a> it over.  And here you can see the image in <a href=""http://www.fruitsalad.freespaces.com/""><b>action</b></a>...if only freespaces met all my webhosting needs T__T!
</lj-cut>

Now let's look at some traditional art shall we?

<lj-cut text=""Experiments start off with  basic ideas..."">

<img src=""http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/8258/harajukutamagradientdy6.jpg""/>

First of all, I know the anatomy is off!  I drew this a while ago and yesterday, I went back to it and darkened the lines, but a <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/14253.html#cutid5""><b>certain</b></a> sketch was right beside it and the pencil from that sketch started rubbing onto this one and smudged it .____.!  Maybe I should lay off the cardboard/bristol board-thick sketchbooks and use printer paper =_=.  Oh and I want to <strike>sacrifice</strike> this to learn to colour like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyung-tae_Kim""><b>this</b></a> gentleman digitally...wish me luck D:!  Also the outfit design is from <a href=""http://img518.imageshack.us/img518/8831/nightqi0.jpg""><b>this old</b></a> cg pic :o!

<img src=""http://img174.imageshack.us/img174/5780/harajukutamasepiakh3.jpg""/>

In case you like sepia, this is for you :P!
</lj-cut>

Now we're on the home stretch!  There's a belief you know, that says an artist will put a little of themselves in the art they create.  This is especially true when it comes to drawing people.  Some believe that the Mona Lisa is actually a female, self portrait of DaVinci...now I'm not going to draw a male version of myself(at least not yet).  But sometimes...

<lj-cut text=""I gain inspiration from looking in the mirror..."">

<img src=""http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/2774/lmfbluefj4.jpg""/>

Here I go again with my semi-realistic anime style :o!  Yes I am sure there's problems with that bent arm, but at least, I tried something different.  Can I tell you all how difficult it is to draw hair twists?  I would have to be out of my mind to try and ink that hair in Painter.  If I tell anyone on AIM or MSN I am going to ink this digitally...tell me I am a damn fool -_-!  I must say, I do rather like the blue look, I must cg something simple and use a blue like this :D!  So it's supposed to be me, I forgot my glasses and I really do need to learn to draw better glasses D:.  Also, I wish I had one of those sweaters that falls off the shoulders but supposedly <strike>my ginormous, womanly, voluptuous breasts</strike> my curves get in the way o_o!  Now just to ink this with my trusty <b>fineliner pens</b> NOT <b>Corel Painter IX.5</b>.
</lj-cut>


And apparently, no artblog post would be complete without...

<lj-cut text=""R A N D O M  DOODLES!"">

<img src=""http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/6691/randomideas6wk8.jpg""/>

I seriously need to bring a sketchbook with me for in between classes @__@!

<img src=""http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/9347/mikedoodleqx1.jpg""/>

No seriously!
</lj-cut>

Ooooookaaaay!  I hope that makes up for the month of inactivity and that's all for today!

"event","So I had my stitches were removed , Wednesday of this week(I'll write about that at <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou"">) and the doctor says it will take a few weeks for the cut to heal and for my pinky to close up and look normal again D:!  So I still have to be very careful about holding things and using my right hand.  Luckily for me , I'm <b>lefthanded</b> so major things like <b>writing/drawing</b> aren't really affected.  But I will say this whole thing really does show in some ways , how much you need both your hands to do simple tasks...Case in point , I'm left handed correct?  Well I still need to use my right to <b>hold</b> any sketchbook/clipboard or paper I use , I still need it to use a computer mouse , hold glasses with drinks , hold gaming controllers and other things.  But one of the great things about nature is , that when you're injured you'll find a way to adapt!  Now let me show you how I've adapted...

<lj-cut text=""Tablets are gaining popularity as a replacement for computer mice!"">

<img src=""http://img352.imageshack.us/img352/3482/orenjiyo7.jpg""/>

Trying to draw something a little less abstract than you usual circles , stripes , X's and other shapes.  This actually started out as a <a href=""http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/1623/orenjiwallpaperxe2.jpg""/><b>wallpaper</b></a> but after fixing the text in the caption bubble and adding the necessary finishing touches , I had a nice little <a href=""http://img135.imageshack.us/img135/2350/orenjiwallpapernumbah2zs9.jpg""/><b>wallpaper</b></a> image that could be posted to <a href=""http://www.utena-tenjou10.deviantart.com""><b>deviantArt</b></a>.  And said wallpaper image was then cropped into the image you see before you.  I really have to say I've very proud with how this came out and quite surprised the number of people who downloaded it and used it as their desktop wallpaper...hell even people from school found out about it O_o!  Perhaps I should make this into a lovely 300<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch""><b>dpi</b></a> picture ,  get a <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/""><b>Cafepress</b></a> account and make little tshirts :O...anyone want to buy one?  Oh and lastly , yes , <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_tablet""><b>graphics tablets</b></a> can be used instead of a mouse :P!
</lj-cut>

That was not to be the last of that little orange fella , oh no , there was more!!!

<lj-cut text=""She must be STOPPED DAMMIT!"">

<img src=""http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/9135/orenjiid2le8.jpg""/>

I was in need of a new deviantArt ID , so I booted up ol' Photoshop and went to work.  After <a href=""http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/879/orenjiidiz2.jpg""><b>widening</b></a> out the image so that the speech bubble is seen , you get what you see here :D!  And the orange is right , I should be resting D:!
</lj-cut>


But it's not all work all the time , sometimes I make things for fun too :P!

<lj-cut text=""MSN: Not just for chatting anymore!"">

<img src=""http://img161.imageshack.us/img161/9518/msndoodlesaa9.jpg""/>

Gotta love that handwriting function :O.  They need to make the writing area wider or I need to learn to draw smaller -_-!
</lj-cut>

And there's always pencil doodles...

<lj-cut text=""Put down the goddam graph paper already!"">

<img src=""http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/4499/randomideas5tv4.jpg""/>

This is proof that I need to walk with a sketchbook during free periods .__.!  Also this is proof that , over time , as one improves with their anatomy and technical drawing skills , the <a href=""http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2763/yuletideimprovement0tj.jpg""><b>look</b></a> of their <a href=""http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2763/yuletideimprovement0tj.jpg""><b>characters</b></a> changes over time.  For those of you who do not know , this is <b>Yasu</b>. This blond haired <a href=""http://static.flickr.com/32/100666815_9dedcfe5f6_o.jpg""/><b>chick</b></a> that is drawn from <a href=""http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/8227/reflectionqn7.jpg""><b>time</b></a> to <a href=""http://img503.imageshack.us/img503/741/realisticanimeyasupencivs5.jpg""><b>time</b></a>. She is associated with this girl who has silver hair and yellow/gold <a href=""http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/381/backwardsandfowardsaz8.jpg""><b>streaks</b></a> and another girl that has <a href=""http://i1.tinypic.com/280tjf5.jpg""><b>jet black</b></a> hair :P.  I think I shall stick with this curly , ringlet look , yet she still retains hair that sticks up in the air like antennae XD!
</lj-cut>
 

Last but certainly not least , I give you...

<lj-cut text=""The start of a little project!"">

<img src=""http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/7471/beachpartypreviewvd5.jpg""/>

This is just a <a href=""http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/6189/beachpartywebpagebgce2.jpg""><b>preview</b></a> image for a little something I'm working on.  Want a hint?  Read through this <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/62951.html""><b>new year resolution</b></a> entry and this entry on my <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/49245.html""/><b>artistic</b></a> ambitions and it should become clear to you.  All I ask of you guys is...does anyone know of any well run(and inexpensive , if not free) web hosting services?  I've talked to a couple people about it , but the more opinions the better :D!
</lj-cut>

I will try and draw some real people soon , drawing anthropomorphic things is great but I must not forget how to draw the things I started out drawing before this to.  So that's all the artsy stuff for now.  Now I head off to work D:!

Anthy Himemiya of Revolutionary Girl Utena fame.  Started this one in Corel Painter with my old , Wacom Graphire3 tablet and ended it , last week Thursday when I got my Wacom Bamboo Fun[Medium sized] tablet :O.  Gosh this new tablet has such a smooth and sleek look while having a ton of features.  I'll try and finish this tonight or sometime during the week and work on my artistic ""todo list"".
</lj-cut>

And I even threw a little colour on this too...

<lj-cut text=""But rainbows make the world brighter!"">

<img src=""http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/9531/colouringtherosebridepc0.jpg""/>

Nothing like looking at how something turns out with basic colours :D!
</lj-cut>

Sadly this is a short post , but of course there's all the older posts for you to look and comment at :D.  Hope everyone had a good holiday.  Let's hope everyone survives what's left of the school year and whatever time you have left at work.  So that's all for now , later everyone!

Hopefully everyone's holiday and the first two days of 2008 have gone well so far.  Been relatively quiet for me but it's been artistically productive too!

 <lj-cut text=""We start off with a sketch..."">

<img src=""http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/8224/elfishgincolourgradienthn8.jpg""/>

Yes ladies and gentlemen , it's my original character ,<b>Gin Hoshi</b> in chibi demonic , santa elf form XD!  And for the first time ever , I've drawn her hair in a way that I actually like.  And you know something else?  Using a reference from a <a href=""http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/gallery/fiche.php?id=142""><b>hairstyle magazine</b></a> actually helps :D!!  When I first drew this , I had hoped to ink and colour it for Christmas..
</lj-cut>

And as always when we start with a sketch , we just have to outline it somehow.  This time , I went with the old fashioned way...

<lj-cut text=""If you're thinking about being my baby , it don't matter if you're black or white! Or...sepia!"">

<img src=""http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/8591/elfishginsepiarz4.jpg""/>

Inked with my trusty , Pilot DR Drawing/Pigmentliner pens :D!

And for those of you who prefer plain black and white...

<img src=""http://img183.imageshack.us/img183/6501/elfishginoriginalub0.jpg""/>

God I love my fancy font sets :P!
</lj-cut>

And once we have outlined our sketch there's nothing left but to colour it and...

<lj-cut text=""I give you the last of 2007 and the first of 2008!"">

<img src=""http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/381/backwardsandfowardsaz8.jpg""/>

Coloured partly in ol' Photoshop 7.0 and finished off in Photoshop CS2 with my e3 Works and Wacom Graphire3 tablet.  Cel-shading is fun and making the grid pattern was definitely fun to make :3!
</lj-cut>

And now that you've got your fill of eyecandy , it's off to update my regular blog.  So that's all for today , later everyone!

"event","Well I done with my exams and free from school for the time being and Christmas is less than a week away.  It is at this time that artists on and offline turn to this special season for inspiration...

<lj-cut text=""It all started with a wallpaper..."">

<img src=""http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/3672/seasonssgreetingstextanqb5.jpg""/>

As stated from the lj-cut title , this came to be from wanting to make a Christmas themed wallpaper.  I was following a vector tutorial for making wallpapers and unfortunately , I forgot to make the canvas the right size for a wallpaper(at least 1024x768px).  Instead I had this square shaped image , so making the best of it I <a href=""http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/3189/seasonssgreetingsnotextsc8.jpg""><b>finished</b></a> the picture , added my little <a href=""http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5108/seasonssgreetingstextkg5.jpg""/><b>watermark</b></a> and a border.  And there you have it , a digital image completely made of vectors in good ol' Photoshop with my handy-dandy Wacom Graphire3 tablet!
</lj-cut>

Keeping up with the Christmas spirit , I had to make sure I was holiday ready on livejournal...

<lj-cut text=""Presents?  I want some!"">

<img src=""http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/8366/presentavatarjo9.jpg""/>

A little avatar from the first image :P!
</lj-cut>

Then there was my attempt at making a ""real"" Christmas wallpaper...it wasn't productive :(!

<lj-cut text=""All I want for Christmas is my two front...WALLPAPERS!"">

<img src=""http://img174.imageshack.us/img174/4171/christmaswallpapertexthp2.jpg""/> 

I have to say that this was a lot of <a href=""http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/6151/christmaswallpapernotexua7.jpg""><b>fun</b></a> to make but the thing is , this ""wallpaper"" still isn't the right size D:...I guess I'll try again today XP!
</lj-cut>

Here's something a little different!  Now I'm going to show you somethings I had to make for this <strike>incredibly useless , waste of my &*^)!@# time , waste of a student's *^%)!@ money</strike> computer course...

<lj-cut text=""You need to create a background image , a title image and a logo!"">

<img src=""http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/8607/heartlogolargeue3.jpg""/>

The final project of said course asked students to make a power point presentation on any topic(I chose the roles of computers in art and digital art in general).  We had to create a company ""logo"" and this is mine.  I had to <a href=""http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/2704/heartlogosmalliv5.jpg""/><b>shrink</b></a> it down a little to make sure it fit onto the slides though.

<img src=""http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/5751/magatamalogolargevd8.jpg""/>

This is a japanese <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magatama""><b>magatama</b></a>.  I made this for my background image for the presentation.  Not sure why I picked this , but I like it :O!  And this too was <a href=""http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5711/magatamalogosmalliv9.jpg""><b>shrunk</b></a> down.

<img src=""http://img297.imageshack.us/img297/5601/yinyanglogolargeii0.jpg""/>

And this is for the title image , it's your usual <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinyang""><b>yinyang</b></a> symbol.  At first I wanted to make <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe""><b>tomoe</b></a> but I couldn't get the shape right D""!  So I went with this.  Like with the others , this too was <a href=""http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/8881/yinyanglogosmallgt7.jpg""/><b>shrunk</b></a> down.  Of course for all of these images , the white background was removed and made all trasparent ish :P!
</lj-cut>

And for this project , I got a <b>40/50</b> :D!

Last but not least...I just have to tell you about an early Christmas present that I received last Wednesday...

<lj-cut text=""Out with the old and in with the new!"">

Yes ladies and germs , I was given Christmas money , went to WalMart where I work and got me an <b>80GB iPod Classic</b> in black.  I'll write more about this at <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou"">!
</lj-cut>

And that's all the art for the time being , season's greetings everyone and have a happy new year!

"event","Hey there everyone , it's coming down to the Christmas Holidays and that means more art and more updates to this place.  Now if you've been keeping tabs , you know that every now and then I'll take a little detour from the cg artwork with some vector art and css layouts.  Well it's that time again for some css fun...

<lj-cut text=""Call a code red!!"">

<img src=""http://img410.imageshack.us/img410/4659/coderedcsssmallkf1.jpg""/>

Now this is a little something that I made for my <a href=""http://www.utena-tenjou10.deviantart.com""><b>deviantArt</b></a> journal <a href=""http://www.utena-tenjou10.deviantart.com/journal""><b>section</b></a>.  One of the perks to being a ""subscriber"" on the site is that you can design custom made css layouts for the journals.  And for this particular one , my only idea was something that was red and white...I never expected the little circle things to look like the Target logo , I swear D:!  And if you want to see a larger version of this image , <a href=""http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/3019/coderedcsslargeex1.jpg""><b>here</b></a> you go!  Also , if you want a ""live"" preview , look right <a href=""http://utena-tenjou10.deviantart.com/journal/""><b>here</b></a>!  I have to admit , it was fun to make this.
</lj-cut>

Now we all know that you don't have to use css coding only in the world of deviantArt blogs!  Of course you can use them for blogs too.  Blogs like the ones found in livejournal...

<lj-cut text=""A cyber rainbow for the digital age..."">

Okay everyone , I'm going to do something really different!  One thing I've always wanted to do since I've started making livejournal layouts , is to make a layout that <b>other people</b> could[and would want to] use and what I'm about post is the first out of (hopefully) many layouts...so here goes:

<a href=""http://img259.imageshack.us/my.php?image=layoutpreviewbe3.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/1479/layoutpreviewbe3.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a>

<small><b>Theme:</b> Cyber Rainbow
<b>Style:</b> Smooth Sailing
<b>System:</b> S2
<b>Works w/ Navigation Strip:</b> Yes , but it doesn't look that nice.
<b>Customized Comment Pages:</b> Yes[Paid and Permanent accounts only!]
<b>Best View:</b> 1024x768 , 1280x1024
<b>Browser:</b> Firefox & IE[should work on other browsers too!]
<b>Account Type:</b> All account levels!
<b>Live Preview:</b> <lj user=""cyberrainbow"">
<b>Credit:</b> <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou""> or <lj user=""known_as_leah""></small>

<u><b>Things to Remember</b></u>

<b>o1.</b> The graphics for this layout were created by me using Adobe Photoshop ver 7.0 and a Wacom Grahire3 Tablet.
<b>o2.</b> The custom security , user and community icons are from <a href=""http://www.famfamfam.com""><b>Famfamfam</b></a>
<b>o3.</b> All the graphics have been uploaded to <a href=""http://www.imageshack.us""><b>imageshack</b></a> , if the images do not load properly , you just need to reupload them[I'll provide a .rar file with the graphics and css codes].
<b>o4.</b> If there are any mistakes or problems with the coding , just reply to this entry and I'll do my best to help ASAP :D!
<b>o5.</b> If you want to make a layout yourself , <lj user=""everything_lj""> is a great place for tutorials!

And now for the codes...

Started this one a loooong time <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/10524.html#cutid3""><b>ago</b></a>!  And I've been working on it every chance I could get.  Unfortunately school and an even more demanding job saps away from my free time.  And the times that I do want to draw I'm just exhausted...hopefully with the Christmas holidays around the corner I'll get a chance to draw and colour things a little faster instead of taking weeks on end to finish something like this did.  Anywhoo this was made for a friend of mine on a gaiaonline art ""shop"" thread , all she wanted was a picture of her gaian avatar and a bridge in the background scene.  With a reference picture of her avatar and the bridge I ended up making 5 sketches with 2 that I really liked.  This was one of them and the other , because I feel horrible for taking so long to colour this , I'm going to finish the other picture free of charge :D.  Hope she likes both!

</lj-cut>

Feeling exhilarated by how that picture came out , and having some recently finished <a href=""http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/7763/chibiutenaartbloglinearmu6.jpg""><b>lineart</b></a> sitting on my brand new pc , last week Monday I started to colour it.  This was a nice little experiment in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel-shaded_animation""><b>cel-shading</b></a> since I really have NO clue how to do it.  

<lj-cut text=""Was this experiment a success?"">

I can't very well use <b>Revolutionary Girl Utena</b> themed screen names [kakumei_tenjou , utena-tenjou10 and others] and not draw some fanart related to the series , especially the main character!  So here's a little chibi for all the RGU fans to enjoy!

And noticing the almost blank expression on Miss Tenjou's face , spending too much time reading some of those crazy encyclopedia dramatica articles(especially <a href=""http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/LOL_WUT""><b>this</b></a> one)and having a <b>pen tool</b> and internet tutorials at my disposal...well...I had to be a little silly...

You know something?  Making speech bubbles is fun :P.  And so is...

<img src=""http://img107.imageshack.us/img107/3776/lolutenaljiconyx2.jpg""/>

Making matching avatars :D!  So now I have a ""LOL WUT"" for just that special occasion :3!
</lj-cut>

Now just to finish the pictures I promised people then I'm set...school , work , give me some time to my self...<b>PLEASE</b>!!  And that's all for today but hopefully more will come soon.

"event","Here's a little something quick.  A little while ago a special <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2tyyol""><b>event</b></a> happened in my life as an artist and as a member of the popular art community deviantArt.  As a result of my extreme elation and out and out excitement I went and offered to make free , simple cg images for <b>5</b> people.  Surprisingly , from all the replies , there are people who actually want free stuff from me :O.  That in it's self leaves me touched &hearts;...

<lj-cut text=""Nulla dies sin linea..."">

<img src=""http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/3093/bouegenschoolgirlginartnq9.jpg""/>

One of the people who is to get free art is ol' <lj user=""revulo"">.  She wanted me to draw a <a href=""http://revulo.livejournal.com/429032.html#cutid1""><b>bouegen</b></a> which is a really neat , fictional race of characters she created.  So spending a day reading through most of her role play and art related postings about them , I took pencil to sketchbook paper.  For this , I really tried overcoming that ""wonderful"" lefthander trait to smudge everything because of the way the heel of the hand rests on the page.  I thought wearing tight latex gloves could do it , but I was wrong , so very wrong D:...Surprisingly though , when the sketch was scanned , it came out incredibly bright(hmmm Windows vista+lexmark multifunction printers=Clean sketches o_O?).  Then a little adjustments of the brightness , contrast and a little erasing here and there in photoshop and voila!  Then to make it look a little professional-ish I added a border and my signature(on this deviantArt <a href=""http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/595/bouegenschoolgirlgindasne1.jpg""><b>version</b></a>).  Would you guys laugh at me a lot if I told you that I spent half an hour trying to sign my name?  I don't know if my hand got tired or my brain stopped working but I couldn't spell my last name if my life depended on it...

""FRANXIo...no""
""FRANCS...nada!""
""FRANCI..*the letters veer off the page*!!!""
""FRANCIII*drops the pen* yay!""
""FRANCIS...I DON'T LIKE HOW THOSE LETTERS LOOK!!!!!!""
""FRANCIS...OH MAI FUGGIN' GAWD FINALLY!  I SPELL MAH NAME YO'!""

...I fail at writing apparently D:!
</lj-cut>

So that's all we have for the moment , but if you'd like to know more about the event that I have described , let me direct you to some links:

A thank you from the <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/12220.html""><b>artBLOG</b></a>.

"event","Hi there everyone , long time , no update!  Well you see , my computer decided to up and <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/56178.html""><b>die</b></a> on me , so my mother and I went out and bought a <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/56387.html""><b>new</b></a> one.  After spending a hour so getting the basic setup going and another day reinstalling my favourite fonts sets , it was time to get back to the business of making art(and doing stuff for school...I hate you school!)...

<lj-cut text=""Every picture starts with...lines."">

<img src=""http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/7763/chibiutenaartbloglinearmu6.jpg""/>

Now if you're paying attention , you'll notice that this is the inked version of this <a href=""http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/3476/chibiutenapencilartblogko9.jpg""><b>sketch</b></a>.  I started inking this on my older pc and when it conked out of me , I thought I would have to start all over again.  Lucky for me , the lovely tech support guys at Future Shop burnt all the files on my hard drive onto a backup cd...remember kids , BACK UP YOUR SHIT!!!!! This image with inked in <b>Corel Painter IX.5</b> with my <b>Wacom Graphire3</b> pen tablet.
</lj-cut>

 Once we have our lines it's time to add some colour!

<lj-cut text=""Now we lay down the flat colours!"">

<img src=""http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/6645/chibiutenaartblogscreencv1.jpg""/>

Hooray for official artwork!  It's alot better to sample the colours you need from an official picture like this <a href=""http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7328/utenaanthy01lu3.jpg""><b>one</b></a> instead of picking and guessing which photoshop swatch looks ""about"" right.  Note to self , draw in Utena's breast pocket .__.!
</lj-cut>

And since I'm not one for starting off something new with out finishing any older projects , let's take a look at what I'd LIKE to finish SOON.  If only school and work would LET ME DRAW FOR AT LEAST A DAMN HOUR OR TWO.     I am seriously considering putting my photoshop PSD files onto a flash drive , taking my older tablet with me to school , commandeering an Apple computer with photshop(despite all things Apple being the work of satan) or installing photoshop onto my laptop and doing something with my ridiculously long spare periods between classes.  I really should *sigh*!

<lj-cut text="" I will finish these , so help me God!!!"">

<img src=""http://img102.imageshack.us/img102/5410/workvf9.jpg""/>

Made this back when I thought I would never be able to use <a href=""http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/""><b>silkscreen</b></a> font again.  Turns out , I just needed the Truetype font downloaded and just click on the font icon to install it to the windows fonts.  My watermarks are nothing without my silkscreen D:!  And I swear , one day I will include a link to an artsite instead of just my deviantArt page.  AS GOD IS MY WITNESS I WILL HAVE MY ART PAGE |D!  But in the mean time , let me make more descent art to show off on a page :O!
</lj-cut>

Also while playing around with this new computer and photoshop , I came across a new rangnarok online <a href=""http://www.legacyro.com/""><b>server</b></a>.  Most servers have a forum/message board component to their  and where there's message boards , there's forum avatars and forum signatures...

<lj-cut text=""There's always something more personal , about making your own graphics from scratch."">

<img src=""http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/982/redvectorlegacyroavatarhk6.jpg""/>

Then I decided that I wanted a border on this...take two!

<img src=""http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2103/redvectorlegacyroavatarqw4.jpg""/>

Somehow , to me , it looks a lot cleaner with the thin white border.

<img src=""http://img509.imageshack.us/img509/5871/redvectorlegacyrosignatdl3.jpg""/>

And a matching signature image.  Man I go nuts with the circle-y vector thingies and I love the hanging ornaments junk XD.  Maybe I should try combining my digital anime art with vectors some how :O?
</lj-cut>

I'm determined to upload or at least progress in one of my wip's(work[s] in progress) so as soon as I'm done watching Dr.Phil I'm sitting in front of that computer and doing what I have to do.  So that's all the artsy stuff for the time being.

"event","Yesterday(September 5 , 2007) , I reached a little milestone.  After being a member of the popular art community , <b>deviantArt</b> for 3 years I broke through to the <b>20 000</b> pageview mark.  I know there are many who would say that the number of pageviews means nothing , but I can't help but feel proud about this , especially knowing the kinds of things I used to draw when I first joined the <a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v80/UtenaTenjou10/Drawings/Gaia%20Chracters/?action=view&current=Sexy_Kronos.jpg""><b>site</b></a> .  So to anyone who found my <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/bf9qk""><b>deviantArt</b></a> page through this artblog or from <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou"">...

<center><img src=""http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/1919/abthxle3.gif""/></center>

And now that portion is out of the way , onto some art postings!

<lj-cut text=""Sometimes , you need to appreciate low-tech methods..."">

<img src=""http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/3443/aristocraticwipuc4.jpg""/>

As mentioned <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/54987.html""><b>here</b></a> , my computer is on it's last legs and it loves to freeze up on me while doing important school work or labour intensive digital artwork.  And a lot of the time , in order to undo my computer's frozen state , I end up having to shut all the running programs.  Unfortunately , when the computer freezes up and I shut down , it has a lovely effect on artwork being inked in <a href=""http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/4154/ripmywipfi6.jpg""><b>painter</b></a>.  Anyhoo...instead of throwing the monitor out the window like I had planned , I took a colourized print out of that picture's pencil sketch , inked it with my pigmentliner/fineliner pens and went to town.  So there's a screen shot of me colouring it in photoshop.  I still need a better computer -_-!
</lj-cut>

Also while looking through deviantArt I decided to try out my developing vectoring skills and tried my hand at  making a new website button(for my livejournal).

<lj-cut text=""One button , multiple tries!"">

<img src=""http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/8541/deviantartljbuttoncg2.jpg""/>

First of all , I wish deviantArt would allow website buttons that were bigger than their <b>88x31</b> pixel limit because this looked so much better when it was <b>200x70</b> pixels D:!  And go me for forgetting to make this into a <b>GIF</b> file.

<img src=""http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/9177/deviantartljbuttonver20pb2.jpg""/>

See what I mean about things looking better , bigger?

<img src=""http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/600/deviantartljbuttonver20pg2.gif""/>

But you gotta shrink it down...

<img src=""http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/9996/deviantartljbuttonver20eq8.gif""/>


Transparent things are cool too(highlight the image if you can't see the details and if that fails , click <a href=""http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/5717/websitebuttonth5.jpg""><b>here</b></a>!)!  
</lj-cut>

Wouldn't surprise me if I make another button but for now the transparent one will do!  And in the mean time , I have some art and school related activities to do so that's all the art for now!

"event","A PENCIL IS GOOD TOO!  It's true!  As most of you know , them visual artist types like to start their paintings , marker art , coloured pencil thingies , paintings and digital artwork with a <b>pencil</b> sketch(mind you , there are some very talented digital artist who make their sketches right on the computer , perhaps one day I shall be one of them :O?).  So let's take a look at the beginning stages of art pieces shall we? 

<lj-cut text=""I promise you...I will change the world...WITH CHIBIS!"">

<img src=""http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/3476/chibiutenapencilartblogko9.jpg""/>

Now way back in 2003 when I decided that I would start watching less ""cutesy"" animes , I went and watched Revolutionary Girl Utena(aka Shoujo Kakumei Utena) out of curiosity and being drawn to the military style outfits the main characters wear.  Also I was drawn to Utena's mostly gallant personality and tomboyishness.  So in honor of that here's a chibi of her...and I messed up her jacket and made her back too wide and angular .___.;;;.  Well it's the thought that counts right D:?
</lj-cut>

Now I can't draw Utena with out her partner in crime...erm I mean , crazy-symbolic sword fights!

<lj-cut text=""Every prince needs a princess!"">

<img src=""http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/9573/chibianthypencilartbloghc7.jpg""/>

YAY IT'S ANTHY!!!!  Now this chibi I actually like with the pudgy limbs (likes drawing chibis with pudgy limbs as opposed to the huge head and small body ones).  And you know , I could see myself making something such as this into a little sticker or a button and selling it at a convention.  I must make more :O!  And as a side note , STOP DRAWING ON NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE!  THE FEET WILL GET CUT OFF , DRAW IN THE <B>MIDDLE</B> OF THE PAGE  -_______-!  <b>EDIT</b>-Apparently , I cannot spell ""middle"" oy vey....D:!
</lj-cut>

I'm sure I'll end up inking and colouring those two as my deviantArt gallery is somewhat small and needs to grow some.  But enough with the fan art , let's try something original!  Now I've been noticing a certain growing <a href=""http://scrotumnose.deviantart.com/journal/13854493/""><b>trend</b></a> across the pages of deviantart land.  I would love to make one of those pixel ID thingies!  Having said that , I must make the necessary pixel sprite and ""portrait"" image of my fighter.  I opted to make the portrait first...

<lj-cut text=""She once was an aristocrat..."">

<img src=""http://img504.imageshack.us/img504/9476/aristocratpencilartblognh4.jpg""/>

Ladies and gentlemen , I have a confession to make.  I , Leah Marie Francis , love gothic lolita <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Lolita""><b>fashion</b></a>. Ever since I saw this newspaper article about it in 2000 (I think) I've been looking at photos of the outfits and you know what , I'd love to dress like one.  Perhaps it's the ribbons and lacy bits that has me hooked or dark shades(I loves my purple and blacks and a bit of gray too!) or the fact that it isn't like the mainstream , overly tight , overly exposed fashion but I do know that I've always wanted to dress up in something and to draw something two.  One problem though , the outfits are expensive and two , I might look a tad odd being a black lady and all(ZOMG BLACK CHICK WHO DRAWS ANIMU :O!)...but if you want to be techical there is a bit of <b>Chinese</b> and a dash of <b>Indian</b> in my blood lol.  Meh , fashion is fashion , despite ethnicity!  Now I wonder if I could find a dress patter or two and convice my seamstress mother to whip up something(she helped me to make my first cosplay outfit &hearts;!)...if all else fails , I'll just have to either buy bits and pieces online or make something from second hand outfits.  If you know something , PLEASE share your info :3!  And hooray for tattered dresses :D!
</lj-cut>

Once we have a sketch that is clean and we are satisfied with the end result , the artist will proceed to ink and possibly colour the picture.  This can be done with traditional artist pens(which I do the most) or one can embrace the digital age and use some sort of digital art program.  Since I need the practice , I went with the latter...

<lj-cut text=""She was elegant , and her lines...beautiful!"">

<img src=""http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/3593/aristocratwiphs6.jpg""/>

We start off with the head :D!

<img src=""http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/1535/aristocratwipver20je3.jpg""/>

Then we keep going :D!  Something like this just seems to look better with thicker outlines to me!
</lj-cut>

Now <lj user=""revulo""> would you be a dear and remind me to make the pixel sprite lol?  Just to make sure I don't forget or anything.  And of course I'll finish any leftover gaiaonline art too.  But for the time being this is all for now!

"event","So in my last <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/11497.html""><b>entry</b></a> , I presented to you all my attempt at abstract vector artwork.  And from these attempts I started working on a new livejournal layout.  This time , instead of looking for a layout template to work from and customize , I'm giving <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2koh43""><b>s2</b></a> layout styles a try.  For those of you who don't know , first of all , you need to have a <b>paid</b> account(or if you were someone with money to spend , you could have bought a <b>permanent</b> account) and secondly , I'd suggest reading <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2orfek""><b>this</b></a>.  Now that we have the technical stuff out of the way , onto the HEADERS OF DOOM *scary music plays*!

<lj-cut text=""4 headers , 4 attempts!"">

<img src=""http://img57.imageshack.us/img57/8140/orangevectorheaderkt1.jpg""/>

Here's attempt number 1!  A <b>585x180</b> banner that I made when I first started playing around with abstract and orange designs.  As soon as I merged all my layers that I used , I realised that I wanted a <b>bigger</b> header DX!  Now let's look at take two...

<img src=""http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/8116/orangevectorheaderver20en4.jpg""/>

Take 2!  A <b>850x200</b> image , unfortunately this one had to be scrapped because somewhere along the way , I messed up my coding and the damn header was overlapping on the text and navigation bar part of the journal and I don't really know how to fix it ;_;!  Let's see if the third attempt works...

<img src=""http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/1790/orangevectorheaderver30cx0.jpg""/>

This one is <b>800x500</b> , I don't know what in hell I was thinking with this , but what I do know is , I just <b>hate</b> this and want to kill it with fire .____.!  Let's give this header thing one more try...

<img src=""http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/2659/orangevectorheaderver40sy7.jpg""/>

And here's my <b>4th</b> and final attempt!  This one is <b>800x200</b> , I got a fix to stretch the journal container and fixing my header(note to self , learn more about stretching journal containers @_@).  Not only do I like making swirly things , I'm starting to get fixated on drawing circles , hopefully this is beneficial somehow :O....?
</lj-cut>

 So with all those attempts you might be asking ""Leah , you aren't going to delete all those banners you worked on  , are you?""  No , I'm not(I have all of these images saved on my pc) , I'm sure I can use them for other layouts , for example , once I have this layout in the making , just <b>perfect</b> and time goes by , I'm going to give <b>The Boxer</b> or <b>Smooth Sailing</b> with these layer things a try , especially since there seems to be more tutorials involving these two layouts , and communities for them , such as <lj user=""boxer_help""> and <lj user=""s2smoothsailing"">.  It's times like this I'm glad I'm good at finding information for stuff on the net :'D!  And here's one more , decent looking banner for the road...

<lj-cut text=""Present your profile please!"">

<img src=""http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/1264/orangevectorprofileheadah0.jpg""/>

A little <b>350x50</b> one that will be used for my profile page that I need to rewrite :O!  
</lj-cut>

Oh and since I have you all here...

<lj-cut text=""All the cool layouts have backgrounds!"">

<img src=""http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/2387/orangevectorbgimagefh6.jpg""/>

Now this little diddy is <b>300x500</b>.  Is it just me , or do all these circular designs remind you of <b>crop</b> circles , because I'm getting that vibe O_o?
</lj-cut>  

And that's all the <b>orangey goodness</b> and <b>citrusy fun</b> for the time being!  If you want more orangeness , read this <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/234jy9""><b>entry</b></a> and here you can find my layout in <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3ad2wa""><b>progress</b></a>.  Hopefully , with information from various paid account communities and tutorials from places like <lj user=""everything_lj""> , I can get this damn layout up and running soon.  And so , that's all the artwork you're getting for now!

"event","One thing that makes the world of art beautiful is <b>spontaneity</b>.  This evening I went onto my old but still somewhat study pc , to finish this piece of <a href=""http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/4834/lanternhayguyzrq8.jpg""><b>artwork</b></a> while talking to my good buddy <lj user=""revulo"">. Instead of opening up the PSD file(Photoshop Document) with the picture I was working on , I did something completely different...

As I mentioned in my most recent entry at <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou""> , I'm itching to make a new livejournal layout using livejournal's custom themes and <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/ysub4s""><b>layers</b></a>.  I had one idea of a layout based on images of people at school since I'm a college student(last year WHOO HOOO) but another idea popped into my head.  What idea you ask?  <font color=""#FF5A00""><b>Orange</b></font>.  Yes , the colour , the fruit and everything else that goes with it.  So as usual I headed to some of my favourite stock photo places , such as the <a href=""http://www.stockvault.net/""><b>StockVault</b></a> and the <a href=""http://www.sxc.hu/index.phtml""><b>StockXchange</b></a> and searched for orange.  As expected I got tons of photos about oranges(as in the fruit) and a few pictures of lemons and limes(HELLO LIMES ARE <b>GREEN</b>!) , then I tried a few other stock photo sites and found out I'd have to pay in order to use a good photo of a damn orange.  Then I tried google and bingo.  I came across a few nice <b>vector</b> pictures.  Intrigued , I did a google search for ""orange vectors"" and I found this <a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-2263040.html""><b>beauty</b></a>!  Unfortunately I'd have to pay for that one...so I made this an opportunity to try my hand at vector art....so I give you...

<lj-cut text=""Oranju Vectaaa! *does a dramatic anime pose*"">

<img src=""http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/8086/orangevectorpsdaw4.jpg""/>

Saying things in psudo-engrish makes everything better!  Seriously it sounds like the name of some kind of mecha anime , ""NEXT TIME ON HYPER TIME SPACE BEING ORANJU VECTA!"" , if I ever make an anime , I'm giving it that title , please don't steal my idea D:.  So here's my little vector thingy , as you can see I was inspired by the stock photo but really tried to do my own thing too.  You know , making vectors is good practise with photoshop's Pen tool :O!
</lj-cut>

Being satisfied with my first attempt and having the little wheels in my head turning , I decided to make me a little avatar...

<lj-cut text=""Oranjuuuu abataaa!"">

<img src=""http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/1111/orangevectoravatarxl2.jpg""/>

Random fact: Japanese people seem to have this thing about words that have a ""V"" in them , they pronounce as a ""B"" :O!  And this is my little avatar to go with my organge vectory layout(that I hope to have up and running very soon).  As you can see , it's pretty similar to the first one.
</lj-cut>

Then with the success of the avatar , I started to get really ambitious...

<lj-cut text=""An orange header for an orange layout!"">

<img src=""http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/9260/orangevectorheadermg2.jpg""/>

More vectory goodness!  For those of you who pay attention when I change my layouts would notice that I change the <b>name</b> and the <b>subtitle</b> of the journal to go with the layout theme.  Having said that , I plan to rename my journal <font color=""#FF5A00""><b>Orangey Goodness , Citrusy Fun!</b></font> and for a subtitle....how about....<font color=""#FF5A00""><b>Oranju Vectaa!</b></font>...so nerdy D:!
</lj-cut>

So we have an avatar and a header.  Two important components for any livejournal/blog layout.  But what about if you're someone who uses a <b>locked</b> or <b>semi-locked</b> journal?  Well I have you covered!  

<lj-cut text=""It's time for....oranju...erm I mean....Oranjuuuu bannas!"">

And this one for my locked entries.  I know they're locked to the public but I really <b>love</b> making little banners and graphics for things like that...I swear I should make a graphics community for things like this.  As soon as I learn how to make better <b>avatars</b> , <b>brushes</b> , <b>textures</b> and <b>wallpapers</b>.  Stay tuned , I just might do it :P!

<img src=""http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/7008/orangevectortestimonialud2.jpg""/>

I've seen a few people who make a ""Testimonial"" entry where their friends write about their experiences with the person and some of the better quotes are posted on their profile page.  It's something I wouldn't mind trying that out.  I can see it now...""That Leah stole my man and pretended like she didn't like him all along D:!"" or ""Leah said she'd lend me 5 dollars , claimed she was broke and came back with a designer dress and STILL said she was broke!""  or even better ""....who's Leah?"" XD.  Anywhooo , here's my testimonial entry banner :P!
</lj-cut>

So what do you all think?  Are the vectors a hit?  Should I still to drawing and improving my anime art or can I throw in a few of these from time to time?  Are there any other fans of the colour orange as I am lol?  And that concludes today's art posting .  I'm heading to bed , goodnight all :D!

"event","Livejournal has finally recovered from it's power outage.  I love it how when I'm up and ready to update my wonderful little journals(<lj user=""kakumei_tenjou""> and here at <lj user=""known_as_leah"">) , this is <b>EXACTLY</b> when Livejournal decides to conk out on me!  I'm not even making this up , I got up this morning , walked across the little hallway from my bedroom , into the room where I do my ironing and have my pc(lol multipurpose room) , turned on the computer , booted up photoshop , logged onto lj and...

<center><big>LIVEJOURNAL IS TEMPORARILY EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.  WE WILL TRY TO GET BACK ONLINE ASAP!</big></center>

NOOOOO...so the rest of the afternoon I kept myself busy with other computer related activities and actually stepping away from the pc from time to time*gasp*.  And now let's look at some pretty pictures shall we :3?

<lj-cut text=""A little artist for you..."">
<img src=""http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/4237/chibiartistartblogzi1.jpg"" />

A little something that was drawn and coloured for the specific purpose of beautifying posts that I made <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2bpvar""><b>here</b></a>.  As usual , working on my anatomy kinks , any colouring and/or shading kinks and what have you.  But it definitely was fun to colour , adding little bits of white to the skin to make it shiny , especially on the nose makes it look more realistic and less cartoony.  And since we're on the subject of color...do you know how hard it is as a non-caucasian person , finding the right shade of <b>brown</b> to look like ""me""?  I'm not super dark , nor am I super light and I want my gaia avatar too sort of look like me colour wise and it's pretty close.  In this matter , I hate technology and the internet...because of a little thing called <b>Hexadecimal</b> coding for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet""><b>colours</b></a> on the net , photoshop has 12349463201238457019 different shades of brown...black and indian people need to be only <b>one</b> shade , plain and simple.
</lj-cut>  

I'm definitely in a chibi drawing mood so I'm certain that more are on their way , I just need some time to actually sit down and draw.  When I'm all relaxed good things come from it.  Now do you all remember a little <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/10910.html""><b>while</b></a> ago , me mentioning how much I would love to try inking more images digitally?  To be more specific , that I wanted the digital art program , <b>Corel Painter</b> with it's infamous ""Scratchboard"" tool?  Well I GOT IT(more of how I got the program later).  So after reading a few tutorials , playing around with it's settings and doing the moonwalk of happyness , it was time to get down to business...

<lj-cut text=""LOOK MA!  NO PENZ!!!"">
<img src=""http://img384.imageshack.us/img384/3734/digitalinklanternpk7.jpg""/>

I apologize right now in case you are put off by the jaggedness of the lines. As stated on the screenshot image , it was my very first try with the program.  It's alot easier than trying with any form of Bezier <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Computer_graphics""><b>curve</b></a> tool in photoshop and it's a different experience from sitting down with any type of drawing pen(eg. fineliner or pigmentliner that I use) and paper...too bad with computers I can't sit down and ink in between watching tv lol.  Hopefully I'll get better at this over time!
</lj-cut>

So once the inking was done...2 days later because my old computer decided to crash on me and eat my picture.  Flat colour was added...

<lj-cut text=""I FUCKIN' LOVE COLOURING!!!"">
<img src=""http://img260.imageshack.us/img260/5351/lanternpreviewlk4.jpg""/>

It's true , I love to colour.  And...AREN'T MY CLOUDS SEXY <3!?!?  You know , working on stuff in the background really helps you get an idea of how the picture will come out over all.  And by the way , the cut title refers to <a href=""http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/4324/coloringnk4.jpg""><b>this</b></a> XD!
</lj-cut>

And last but not least , since we're on a gaiaonline themed art posting , I give you...SIGNATURE IMAGES.  Since all know Adobe photoshop is not just useful for creating and editing images , it's amazing for making little pictures to put in webforum signatures...

<lj-cut text=""Little images sorta like these..."">
<img src=""http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/5649/stuffgothiceu2.jpg""/> <img src=""http://img470.imageshack.us/img470/3422/stuffeglzj6.jpg""/>
Okay the first one on the left I made quickly and uploaded it and the second on the right I made a day later.  Thank you <a href=""http://www.tektek.org/index.php""><b>Tektek.org</b></a> for your always useful avatar generator and thanks a lot <a href=""http://www.tektek.org/index.php""><b>dAFont</b></a> for always having great font sets that I can use for artwork!  Maaaaaan...looking at these little images reminds me how much I want to dress like an elegant , gothic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Lolita""><b>lolita</b></a> if only once <3...
</lj-cut>

So hopefully all of those pictures will keep you guys going until the next time I update this(which is hopefully soon).  And now I need some much needed sleep!

"event","In my never ending quest to improve artistically , a few days ago I opened up ol' photoshop and tried my hand at inking with the pen tool(aka Bezier curves) and well , not only is this am exercise in extreme patience(took me 3.5 days to complete) but it's also very tricky if you have no idea what's you're doing.  That being said , onto  the screenshot...

<lj-cut text=""I'll never play connect the dots again!"">
<img src=""http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/9333/digitalinkvu8.jpg"" />

The finished product is really something too(I really need to take a screen shot and show it off.  And note to self: STOP USING ""STIMULATE PRESSURE"" ON <b>EVERY</b> DAMN THING @___@!  And compare it to the kind of things I've <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/tag/pens""><b>inked</b></a> with my pigmentliner pens.  
</lj-cut>

I can say from that experience that I really need to purchase the latest version of Corel Painter.  But the thing is I have a little <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2vaqs9""><b>dilemma</b></a>.  So I'm going to ask any of you art students out there , know where I can get painter at a cheaper price or any easier way of inking in photoshop :D?

Of course , once a picture has been outlined in some sort of ink , it must be coloured or made pretty in some shape or form...sooooooo...

<lj-cut text=""Let's start with the face..."">
<img src=""http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/8449/chibiartistscreenshotfp1.jpg"" />

Slight variation in the colouring.  I purposely drew in a nose for this chibi so that I'd have to shade it and add a little , sparkly bit of light that you see on noses depending on the angle...all part of my plan to make*drumroll* SEMI-REALISTIC LOOKING ANIME CHARACTERS!!!  Hopefully it's coming out well.  Painting the glasses and eyes was fun.  Oh and the lips too!
</lj-cut>

But pictures do not just consist of heads , they also have...

<lj-cut text=""Bodies!"">
<img src=""http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/7475/chibiartistscreenshot2gc1.jpg"" />
I'm almost tempted to shade parts of the sweater over again DX.  Why am I such a perfectionish , why God whyyyyyyy?!?  I'm hellbent to finish and post this tomorrow :P!
</lj-cut>

On a side note , thanks <lj user=""revulo""> thanks for the tip for working with large images , it really helps! And that's all from me for now!

A character <a href=""http://img241.imageshack.us/img241/6240/referenceginhoshibyutenxy0.jpg""><b>reference</b></a> sheet(it's in link form because the picture is sort of huge D:!)!

Looking  at this and looking at the way I've been trying to improve my drawing , I <b>know</b> I can do better , so once I've developed this new style a little more and can come up with better poses , I'll remake this.  Dammit I just noticed a screwed up the ear piercings on Ginny D:!  Aw well , if you plan to draw her , pay no mind to that and read <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/2536.html#cutid1""><b>this</b></a>!
</lj-cut>

Also , a big THANK YOU goes out too <lj user=""autovatic""> and <lj user=""revulo""> for your lovely Gin farart :3!  So a little while ago I said I'd make more fanart and I'd try doing some form of comission work.  And of course being on the ever popular gaiaonline is a great opportunity to do both.  Don't you just love situations like this where you kill two birds with one stone?  I sure do!

A little chibi picture of my gaian avatar when dressed like <a href=""http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/6093/reafupreppygirlzr8.png""><b>this</b></a> , looking all preppyish.  But a preppy look is fitting for someone in college.  Anyways , still working on proportions and all that , even though it's a little version of the character , anatomy is still important.  At least inking and colouring this won't take as long as something with a regular sized character with a detailed background , sheesh!  And for a little shop promotion , here's the <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2bpvar""><b>shop</b></a> I'm decorating with this image.
</lj-cut>

It's amazing how much gold(the currency of the site) you can make from selling your artistic services!  Even though the gold isn't real(how I'd love to have 300K in my bank account!!) , it is a nice little ego boost and it's a good way to have your art seen.  So I'm jumping on the commission bandwagon and selling some art myself and hopefully if I do well , more people will flock to my deviantArt page and maybe , just maybe , people will want to pay <b>real</b> money for my services...A little while ago , I had a little <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2u92od""><b>shop</b></a> with a friend of mine who would play ragnarok online with me.    Now another RO friend commissioned me to draw her <a href=""http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/6071/relliuschineseghostzu4.png""><b>avatar</b></a>.  Her only request was that I draw a brige that looks like this <a href=""http://img182.imageshack.us/img182/3669/bridgepicturetm0.jpg""><b>one</b></a>.  Over time , I tried drawing different things related to this and each sketch I ended up hating and tossing into my shredder.  Then the beginning of this week I tried again , came up with one sketch , wasn't too sure about it and drew another.  Now I have a dilemma , I have <b>two</b> pictures that can be coloured and given to the customer.  But I don't know which one to go with...

<lj-cut text=""Pick a picture , any picture!"">

<img src=""http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/9589/lanternpencilpsdij4.jpg"" /> <img src=""http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/8585/glowpencilgg0.jpg"" />

The picture on the left is the first one I drew on some printer paper and the second I drew in a sketchbook.  I kind of like the second one because , it looks pretty proportionate and I've noticed I always draw characters really small and ""squished"" into a small space on the page.  So what do you guys think?  I might just colour both and decide later :P!  As a side note , I really need to do something about posing hands XP!

"event","It's been a little while since I've updated this thing , only because my new job at WalMart has me working almost every day*sigh* on the bright side I've requested to work the morning shift more often to have time for myself.  And even better , with all the hours I've been working it's MORE MONEY :P!  And now onto the task at hand , showing off artwork!  

Now I strongly believe that art isn't just limited to drawings , paintings , digital or traditional art , sculpture or any of those ""usual"" ways of making art.  In this digital age people(like myself) have embraced computers and new technology to express themselves artistically.  Now that it's easier to obtain a webspace or a blogging account people are learning HTML and CSS coding to make their little corner of the internet a little brighter and I'm no different(you'd know this if you read this <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/9280.html""><b>little</b></a> entry at the top of the page!).  So without further ado...

<lj-cut text=""The result of boredom!"">
<img src=""http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/7686/bgcsspreviewfs1.jpg""/>
Now this took me <b>2</b> days to complete! If you couldn't tell , this is one of those CSS blog/journal layouts  for deviantart.  One thing about it irks me though , I've been wanting to shift the position of the title and I have <b>NO</b> idea how to do this...I guess I'll leave it for the time being.  Maybe I'll check the coding for errors and submit it as a deviation for others to use(and take out the header with my artwork).  <a href=""http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/7192/bgcsslargenz8.jpg""><b>Here</b></a>'s what the layout would look like on deviantart.  And since I'm on the subject of css coding , I found this <a href=""http://www.chami.com/html-kit/""><b>neat</b></a> little site where you can make a poster of your codes...I swear there must be a computer nerd somewhere , practically going through orgasmic convulsions over this...here's my poster!

<img src=""http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/4728/cssposterblackgraydajouho6.png"" />

Somehow looking at this thing makes the coding seem even more difficult :O!
</lj-cut>

So yes , we can combine technology and good old art to make even more artsy stuff!  But it's still nice to sit down and do the stuff you're used to.  As <a href=""http://kakumei-tenjou.livejournal.com/49245.html#cutid2""><b>stated</b></a> in an entry a little while ago , I'd really love to do something by way of selling my humble anime art.  Like anyone who is trying to develop in any way , I also know that there are things I need to improve on if I'm to stand a chance at sell these pictures.  As such , I've taken it upon myself to spend any free time I've given just drawing and trying out new things and last night , I had such an opportunity...

<lj-cut text=""It was supposed to be just a head and neck!"">
<img src=""http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/1955/yasubluerealisticanimevm5.jpg""/>
I really don't know how this happened!  I had my special ""Practise your anatomy , posing and technical stuff here!"" sketchbook , with the intention of drawing a forward facing head but then I said...""Let me draw a neck so it's not some floating head!"" so I drew a neck and kept going , but then I said...""Let's draw some shoulders to see how the character's upper body is posed!!""...so a skeleton is fashioned out of lines and circles.  But it wasn't enough , never enough for ol' perfectionist Leah , oh NO!  She had to draw a neck shoulders and part of the torso and arms and funny , frilly dress-armwarmer combo and oh my God!  It took me <b>4</b> hours to finish this...drawing JUST a head should not turn out like this and take so long...AHHHHH!  Anyways...are my bodies getting ummm ""better""? I really like how this is sort of animeish sort of realistic and I've very tempted to keep drawing in this manner and keep the extra large eyes for the <a href=""http://img116.imageshack.us/img116/9827/reafudotsps6.jpg""><b>chibis</b></a>!  Hmmm what else can I say?  It's a nice change from attempting to draw waif-ishly thin female characters , after all , them women folk seem to have a propensity towards varying degrees of curves!  

Now just to draw a decent guy in this manner , make detailed images and I am so set.  Oh and if you were wondering if this was some sort of character or a random female , it is the girl in <a href=""http://static.flickr.com/32/100666815_9dedcfe5f6_o.jpg""><b>this</b></a> picture and <a href=""http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2763/yuletideimprovement0tj.jpg""><b>here</b></a>*points to the blonde lass* and also in <a href=""http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/8227/reflectionqn7.jpg""><b>here</b></a>.  <b>Yasu</b> I gave you better looking hair and all that , so to be fair , I go to do the same to the other characters because I'm a fair and I treat all my artistic brainchildren well :P!  Lastly , it's always fun touching up images in photoshop and adding bits of colour to pencil sketches. Not too sure if I'll colour this , I like it as it is to be honest...guess I just have to keep drawing. 
</lj-cut>


So there you have it!  Two forms of art that both were a joy to make!  Perhaps the WalMart fairy will be kind to me and give me more morning shift work instead of me having to go through 102 939 393 983 forms to change my time table >_>!  So that's all you get to look at for now!

Then there's a small listing of her vital statistics and more importantly I've included , little , circular swatches that show the colours I always use for my favourite , heterochromic , introverted , gothic-lolita , punktastic anime girl!  Then there's a couple of heads , I had intended to draw some at different angles...hey I could do that and post a link to said heads here , I win :D!  All that is left is to ink and colour <a href=""http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/3051/nakeyginpencilul2.jpg""><b>this</b></a> and draw those heads.

I must say , I am quite proud of my little circles and how they are outlined...<b>elliptical marquee</b> tool and the <b>stroke</b> layer style function , I love you both &hearts;!

"event","Trying to enjoy what free time I have left before I start a new summer job(WalMart for the WIN!). And of course you all know what I love to do with my free time...*drum roll* MAKE ART WORK!  And here is some of the stuff I have so far...

<lj-cut text=""Still working on that damn anatomy..."">
<img src=""http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/3051/nakeyginpencilul2.jpg"" />
I seriously wish I could draw a perfect body off the top of my head without looking through drawing books , medical text and magazines for help -_-.  Also I wish I could draw descent feet .____.!  Though this would make for a nice character reference sheet image.  And hooray for colour gradients :P!
</lj-cut>

And I'm still trying to clear out my pc's hard drive of old PSD files...

<lj-cut text=""Like this one!"">
<img src=""http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/9782/matsuscreenshotnb2.jpg"" />
For one , using lacy patterns in photoshop really makes the picture look like one of those black and white or sepia photos from way back when.  Also it saves you from trying to paint in a background(still might paint in a little something though).  Not to sure about the way I've shaded the clothes and I might just do over some parts again :P!  <b>EDIT</b> As stated before , I made a second attempt at colouring the clothes.  I think this whole experience tells me that one , proper posing and anatomy makes shading clothes easier and two I should draw more ragnarok high priests/priestesses in different poses for clothing shading opportunities and 3rdly , do not , I repeat <b>DO NOT</b> try colouring in a different method than you are used to unless you know what the hell you are doing T_T...and now for the <a href=""http://img184.imageshack.us/img184/764/hpmatsusepiaimprovedscrin5.jpg"" /><b>screen</b></a>shot!
</lj-cut>

And that is all the art you're getting from me for the time being , hopefully I'll have something done before work takes over my life and if I'm lucking I'll go to the anime north converntion , buy a few art books , maybe even some <b>COPIC</b> markers and get even more inspiration!  And one quick question , who is a fan of the new layout :D?

"event","Nothing like being able to sit down quietly with my pencils , erasers , pens and sketchbook and letting the ideas in my head flow out onto the page.  There's also a wonderful feeling when you take an old pencil sketch that is screaming for attention and finally dust it off and start working on completing the image as the sketch deserves.  So Thrusday evening I sat down with my stuff and did the very things I just described...

<lj-cut text=""Heads are much better inked!"">
<img src=""http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/6158/ginheadsinkartblognh4.jpg"">

And nice thick lines make said heads stand out more :D!  Now this just needs some colour and I'm set set set!

As stated before , it's also nice to work on older artwork...

<lj-cut text=""Sorta like this one!"">

Now the <a href=""http://known-as-leah.livejournal.com/5595.html#cutid2""><b>pencil</b></a> sketch for this back in August of last year.  The pencil sketch has been sitting on my pc ever since then and I want to finish all the sketches and cg art on the computer and clear everything off so this was the first one I picked up.  Also for this picture , I did a little practicing on my pen inking skils(you know varying the line widths to make the picture have more ""depth"" and stuff).  Also I did something a little different with the colouring.  I limited myself to shades of brown (and some orange/yellows here and there) to give the picture the look of those old school , sepia photos.  And this is what I have so far(decided to not post this in link form):

<img src=""http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/2301/matsupreviewcw7.jpg"" />

Hooray for watermarks*points to the little copyright thing*!

And that is all the art for the time being , I'm sure I'll finish these up soon.

"event","Well I've been enjoying a week of doing sweet nothing since finishing up school for the year.  I managed to pull myself away from playing ragnarok online long enough to do something artistic.  I made a promise to myself to draw over the summer and improve artisically.  And now let's see what some of my practise art has produced...

<lj-cut text=""Bring in the Heads!"">
<img src=""http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/5563/ginheadspenciloy9.gif"" />

Yup it's ol' Gin again!  I tried a couple of different head drawing tutorials in the hopes of making my heads less lopsided.  I rather like the profile head and the one of the bottom right.</lj-cut>

And also...

<lj-cut text=""Enter the Userbar!"">
<img src=""http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/4789/dagreenuserbaruq7.jpg"" />

I seriously need to stop making these damn things!  At least this one matches with the usual puke green theme for the deviantArt website.
</lj-cut>

Also I've been watching subtitled episodes of Sailormoon so fanart should be forthcoming!  Actually I just need to do more fanart period!  I should really try drawing fanart from some of the fandoms I list on the profile page.  I WILL DO IT :P!  Anyways that's all the art from me for now!

"event","So with nothing to do at the time , I searched through my bookmarks for this really nice <a href=""http://www.tutorials-db.com/articles/Creating_a_bright_forum_signature_userbar/""><font color=#FF2A00><b>tutorial</b></font></a> on making those userbar thingies.  You know , those web images that say stuff like ""Firefox user"" or ""Wii owner"" , ""iPod User"".  Well I followed along with the tutorial and here's what I got:

<lj-cut text=""DeviantART USER"">
<img src=""http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/8817/dauserbarcn1.jpg"" />

Now I have to remind myself to remake this because the deviantArt site has this green theme to it , it's this puke green theme XD! So when I get around to it , I WILL MAKE A PUKE GREEN USER BAR!!!!!
</lj-cut>

But my bar making didn't stop there , oh no!  I took what I learned and made a few....LINK BUTTONS*scary music plays* and now I will share them with you all because I'm nice like that :3!

<lj-cut text=""I has buttonz!"">
<img src=""http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/6391/livejournalbuttonfancyew0.jpg""/> <img src=""http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1825/deviantartbuttonfancyni4.jpg""/> <img src=""http://img380.imageshack.us/img380/333/artblogbuttonfancyuq7.jpg""/>

If you look on the profile page for this journal or my actual blogging journal at <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou""> you'd see that I threw these in to do their link button work.  Behold the fruits of my loins or erm....my hands O_o?!</lj-cut>

And seeing how I was now on a roll with this....

<lj-cut text=""One more for the road!"">
<img src=""http://img480.imageshack.us/img480/7480/deviantsushisubtitlefanqn4.jpg"" />

This one I plastered into the journal section of my deviantart page.  And with this , I have shown my competence at making images for buttons XD!  I will so get a job with this skill alone!!
</lj-cut>

And there's a bunch of other things I made over a few weeks...

<lj-cut text=""All graphics related somehow..."">
<img src=""http://img377.imageshack.us/img377/4139/squishroforumavie2qf0.jpg"" /><img src=""http://img410.imageshack.us/img410/9537/squishroforumsiggie3kp5.jpg"" />

Perhaps I am too nerdy for my own good , I actually enjoy making little avatars and junk while most ladies like buying clothes and stuff...well I do have a penchant for shoes , hats , accessories , makeup and manicures :O!
</lj-cut>

And last but not least , here's a little anime art!

<lj-cut text=""Behold the chibi of d00m!"">

<img src=""http://img116.imageshack.us/img116/9827/reafudotsps6.jpg"" />

You might want to highlight the image to see the white border!  Now this is the result of me trying to come up with my own super deformed aka ""chibi"" style.  Still working on getting it right with the chubby forearms and calves but I think this came out alright.  I liked the image so much that I made a <a href=""http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/4322/reafubookmarkrm7.jpg""><b>bookmark</b></a> image from it and a deviant <a href=""http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/3233/reafudaavatar2mb3.gif"" /><b>avatar</b></a>.  Yeah , I'm just a graphics making fool :P!
</lj-cut>

And that is all for me artisitically!

Anyways...I've come to learn that part of the livejournaling experience is customizing a layout for your actual journal.  Now there are many places that have premade layouts that you can choose from , such as <lj user=""freelayouts""> , <lj user=""premade_ljs""> and <lj user=""spiralbound_lj"">.  Also , it's never hurt to look for ""free livejournal layouts"" on google.  Some of us , like myself don't mind the challenge and experience of coding their own layout.  As such they turn to tutorial communities such as <lj user=""everything_lj""> for their tutorials , information and help with their layouts.  Once you're done the coding part , it's just a matter of making complementary graphics such as...

Perhaps I should make a few more ""art"" related ones :O?

Train station banners!  One of the first pair of banners that I've made.  Once again these banners were made in photoshop using stock images.  Also these banners correspond to different layouts that I've used in the past , these layouts can be found <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/yzm4et""><b>here</b></a>! 
</lj-cut>

So I have(hopefully) come a long way when it comes to making banners and stuff.  And still working on better layouts/icons and other graphics so that one day I might make one of those graphics communities for people to use(and <b>credit</b>) and enjoy the things I make(Hey that would be <b>4</b> journals I own and maintain , <lj user=""kakumei_tenjou""> , <lj user=""kakumei_test""> , <lj user=""known_as_leah""> and some kind of graphics community :O!).  That reminds me I should make a layout for <lj user=""italianginodany""> like I promised to...but first homework must be completed!  And that's all the eye candy you get for the time being!

So here's my screenshot!  It features a few cg pictures I've done over a period of...6 months?  All of the little screenshots are of images that you can either find right here in this journal , my dA page or in both places.

"event","So what happens when you get a package of cardstock , 65 prismacolour markers , a trio of female characters to choose from , a can of fixative spray and some white paint? 

<lj-cut text=""Some chibi art of course!"">
<img src=""http://img260.imageshack.us/img260/5301/chibischoolgirltamavl9.jpg"" />
And this is a little chibi version of my character , Tama(refer to pictures of a girl with black hair and dark red eyes) and it took me 1.5 hours to draw and 3 hours to colour. I'm busily working on some kind of recognizable chibi style and so far I have this: chubby forearms and chubby calves. As usual , I'm working on proportions and all that , I realise the feet are too big and the arms and legs need work but this is just one practise picture out of many more! And you know , if I keep this up , with the marker art , I could sell a few of this at conventions in Toronto!!! Wish me luck in improving!</lj-cut>

And also...

<lj-cut text=""CAINY HAS COLOUR!!!!"">

Yes , with lots of smudging , highlighting and other work this picture was made into a deviantID. All it needed was a <a href=""http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/7033/chibicaingreenbw6.jpg""><b>green</b></a> background and some <a href=""http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/7618/devidver30caingr6.jpg""><b>text</b></a> and voila!</lj-cut>

More art to come!

"event","For reasons that have yet to be revealed to me , I went and brushed off my old gaia online account , changed the screen name and started posting again. As part of this renewed interest in gaia , I booted up photoshop and made some graphics...

<lj-cut text=""The gaia signature"">
<img src=""http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/513/gaiasig2an2.jpg"" />
So this is my signature image. In order to make it , I went and downloaded special photoshop brushes that give a paint splatter effect which I really like.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Journal Header"">
<img src=""http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/5205/gaiajournalheader3jf6.jpg"" />
And they have this blogging system there(dispite not getting any responses) , I went and made this header , once again with splatter brushes and I learned how to make a silhouette effect with the text*is proud*!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Shop Button"">
<img src=""http://img372.imageshack.us/img372/7062/gaiashopforumbuttonax4.jpg"" />
One way you can some money(well pretend money they call 'gold') is to sell the little items and stuff that people accumulate for their avatars. I have a little shop for that and this is the link button for it. Yay for me learning how to make diagonal scanlines! And being the perfectionist that I am , I went and resized this to go with the ""Stuff"" button , <a href=""http://img102.imageshack.us/img102/4034/gaiashopforumbuttondb7.jpg""><b>see</b></a>?</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Art Shop Button"">
<img src=""http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/2225/squishchocolatever20dw9.jpg"" />
I didn't like the little link button I had before anymore*points to the one at the bottom of this post* , so I remade it , dang I'm having fun with this!</lj-cut>

And now for some artwork!

Another nice  way to make a lot of money(aka gold) on gaia is to offer your artistic services on forums. So a friend of mine and I are running an art shop and this was my first comission. <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v58/beautifulstar/goddess.png""><b>This</b></a> is the character I was asked to draw and she wanted it posed like <a href=""http://www.gaiaonline.com/gaia/redirect.php?r=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fv58%2Fbeautifulstar%2FArt%252004%2Fcommish-1.jpg""><b>so</b></a>. Hey hows my anatomy coming XP? I went and used one of those artist mannequin thingies to get the pose right since the reference looks a little off to me T_T! EDIT-Annnnd <a href=""http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/2910/reniswhitemg9.jpg"" /><b>finished</b></a> and it also comes with <a href=""http://img453.imageshack.us/img453/3290/renisgreenqy9.jpg"" /><b>scanlines</b></a>.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Chibi Avatar"">
<img src=""http://img409.imageshack.us/img409/9771/reafupencilbmpxo7.jpg"">
That would be my avatar , I'm working on developing a cute style for drawing chibis(you know those super deformed , unproportionate anime charactes) and came up with this. Some how drawing something with arms like Popeye and disproportionate calves sort of worked but I'll keep at it.</lj-cut>

Now to get that first picture coloured and posted so I can finish other things! Also , <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/bngkb""><b>here</b></a>'s my gaia profile. And also click this:

"event","Hopefully everyone had a great christmas and their 2007 is going well so far. As a new year begins , there's new art to be made , but before we look at that , here's my christmas picture which happens to be my last coloured image of 2006...

<lj-cut text=""Yultide"">

<img src=""http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2763/yuletideimprovement0tj.jpg"" />

It features my original characters(from left to right) Yasu , Gin and Tama. A few days ago , I noticed I coloured Gin's left eye(viewer's right) the wrong colour. Her left eye is supposed to be <b>green</b> while the right is <b>blue</b> XD. <a href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/154/332387187_06d8f43986_o.jpg""><b>Here</b></a>'s the mistake!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""A Tale of 3 Cains"">

<img src=""http://img183.imageshack.us/img183/3477/ataleof3cains1fy.jpg"" />

Been trucking along on this picture , it took me 3 tries but they say 3rd time's the charm. I'm still not happy with the basic shading of the skin so it's time for Take 4! Now for attempt number <a href=""http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/7813/the4thchapterofthetalekr6.jpg""><b>4</b></a>! And the paler one looks better , it goes with <a href=""http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/4402/witchinghouryt3.jpg""><b>this</b></a> picture.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Nekkid Gin!"">

Working on my female anatomy and proportions. Also I plan to make an attempt (keyword attempt) at making one(or more) of those character reference sheets. As such ol' Gin will be the first victim erm I mean subject since she's my first character *clings to her as if she were my baby* O_o! Note to self , I gotta learn to draw better feet and hands , her hand(right to be exact) I don't know if it's too long or something and I need to learn to draw better thumbs and pinkies T_T! And hooray for crosshatching to colour hair and eyes :D! </lj-cut>
 
And that's all for now because I am nauseated  something awful X_X!

Here we see my original characters(from left to right) Yasu , Gin and Tama in christmas themed outfits...let me tell you , when you're not used to drawing more then <b>2</b> people at a time , in different poses , it can be a little tricky , but this is how a person learns...It will be coloured soon! Next I really should make some reference pictures for these three ladies. EDIT-I cleaned up the line art and removed the extra specks and smudges that came from the picture being scanned. Also I made the lineart a darker brown.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Chibi Cain"">

My first real attempt at guys and my first good attempt at drawing different facial angles! This was my fastest cg ever being completed in 3 days! This lovely witch well worlock if you want to be techical is named Cain. YAY more OC's now just to make some reference pictures and decide wheather or not to use them for a piece of fiction or a manga :O! Got to fix that border too...I'll do that later :p! I have this on my dA page , go and comment on it :O!!!!

Here is my latest inked picture...

<lj-cut text=""Chibi Cain"">

Always a good idea to practise drawing chibis :D! Especially proportionate ones...chibis? Proportions? Wow XD! It's Cainy again XD. I might make this into a new deviant ID.
</lj-cut>

Came across some random doodles yesterday too

<lj-cut text=""The doodles"">

Found these little sketches in a binder somewhere , it's my OC's :D!
</lj-cut>

Lastly , here are all of the digital wip's that need some colouring. Now that I've learned to effectively use the paint bucket and the polygonal lasso tool I HOPE this won't take too long XP!

<lj-cut text=""Works in Progress"">

"event","consistency is not my thing... constant change in emotion warps my soul twisting my being... i dont kno how much more i can take... anger, hate, love, happiness, sadness trying to take over at the same time with the victor taking me in its grip... save me please...

RAGE!... i've missed this glorious feeling, 
let it grip me, consume me, and take me away
to a place where nothing matters but revenge, 
and i will have no pain again, only the joy 
of seeing your corpse, then this rage will 
completely destroy me and i will be gone, 
having finished my final task...
HATE!... and spite, you stir up these feelings
inside me, i think about you and i desire to
kill, hate comes from the tortured soul, and 
is passed on, and in me grows a hatred that
you cannot even begin to fathom, and will
be passed unto you in the form of my blade...
SADNESS... will take over me, as i gasp for
air, the adrenaline flowing through my body
is leaving me, and leaving behind a feeling of 
emptiness, now that the fire of my rage has been
put out, and my hatred has escaped into your corpse,
i have nothing left, and as was said in the fire, 
this rage has consumed me, off to quench my 
unquenchable thirst for blood, i go out into the
world, and will soon find my death..."

Then the next day i went to gina's soccer game. haha that was fun, me and lauren went and played shoot-em-up games one where we had to remodulate our phasers or we would be assimilated haha don't ask. then lauren saw the dasani water bottle was taller thab her and was jealous so i ripped it off the wall and she did the dasani water bottle dance hahaha. then um yea not much else. then next weekend kathleen came over and it was pretty freakin sweet. we attempted to watch some movies lol. then saturday we went to newport with kathleen meredith lauren alex colin cat and um some other people or somthin. that was really fun. then i had to study and stuff, ugh. but this weekend was kick ass cuz matt came over. so we went to go meet him at jungle jims and i got some highly caffienated beverages and the fun began. but we had to make a detour to get my sweet blue cast, they gave me the use of my thumb yay! so then we went home and played video games and got hyped up on full throttle. then lauren and gina came over to play football and lauren finally got me pink shoelaces!! they kick so much ass!!then we played football and got muddy and stuff then walked around then matt drove 60 mph on my street in gina's car hahaha that was great! then um we conviced gina to drive to blockbuster and rent a scary movie so they got texas chainsaw massacre... the OLD one. it was hilarious though cuz it was so corny. she ran into a tree branch and we watched just that part like 8 times. then the next day kathleen was supposed to come over but her parents wouldn't let her so i am mad at them about that grrrr but oh well... so me and matt just played video games. but then i got my temps and we totally went driving in my dad's manual lancer, so i have mastered stick now haha it was sooo fun!! driving is the best!! and i did a burnout yes! then we played more video games and walked places and stuff. then we went to gina's soccer game and played the remodulate phasers game some more and did other stuff. it was fun. then umm we woke up early this morning for easter mass, woo hoo. then me and matt went to my gmas and omg mitchy is the coolest kid ever. i think me and matt screwed him up lol, he's gonna turn out so weird but cool, but shh it wasn't us at all i swear. so anywhow he's like 5, and he literally quoted half of napolean dynamite word for word in his cute little 5 year old voice it was the best! so yea then we hung out and did funny stuff that i'm still laughing about but can't remember wat it is lol if that makes sense. then he had to go and life went on boring as usual. the end. and this entry was longer the first time but my stupid cast hit a button and it got erased. haha peace out

Then today because of all the stress from last night i guess i was even more sick and stayed home from school."

"event","ok this weekend kicked major ass. friday was great. me kathleen jackie and ashley went to uss nightmare. it wasn't that scary but it was still really good. ashley was freaked out so i told all of the workers to scare her and that was just freakin hilarious. then we went to newport and got ice cream and saw a majic show. ok so the guy pulled a 5 dollar bill out of a kiwi... thats a new one lol. then saturday was the most excellent dance. i had to dress up and that sucked but its all good cuz it was for kathleen. dinner was hilarious. me and chris came up with some funny shit haha. then the dance was sweet. i did miss the greenday concert and i heard it was awesome so i'm very pissed about that, but hopefully they will make a dvd or somethin. then today i had to write a paper oh joy. and i was home alone and almost died of starvation because i somehow messed up our last instant oatmeal, don't ask how ok. and since i can't cook i had nothing to eat. so me and lauren decided that she's gonna have to cook for me when i move out.

"event","well this weekend was fun. friday alex came over and we played some xbox, watched some aqua teen, the watched Ronin (the greatest movie ever). Then saturday was the game. I was basically freezing my ass off the whole time but kathleen was there so it was worth it. Josh is now goin to the x dance with... brace yourself... LILLY VOLLE *pause for intense laughter*. Sorry Josh but you have to admit that it's extremely funny. Then sunday was homework day, oh joy. At least i did some resarch with matt on some vettes we want. We have determined that our kick ass cars shall be either classic vettes or stangs. Well thats about it.

"event","ok so this was probably the ultimate weekend. Friday I went to the x vs moeller game. That was insane. We were dominating, then down, then won! Everyone was crazy. I was crazy from caffiene mints and chugging a mountain dew. Kathleen was there and that made it all the better. Then we went to the mixer which was ome good times, cuz the caffiene still hadn't worn off since i had another mountain dew. Then today me kathleen lisa and lisa's bro went to newport. Saw a movie and just hung out. It was awesome, good times. Then to repeat myself... BE AT THE GREENDAY CONCERT OCT. 23!!!!!!!

"event","Yea so yesterday i went to the x mixer and it was crazy, thats all i got to say about that. Then today i could go to PKI with my family or Nippert with my friends. I chose Nippert, and boy did i choose wrong. It rained and rained and my ride stayed there so i was forced to wait and wait. Then Jackie called and saved me, we talked for like a half an hour, and it was all good. Then i went to larosas with kevin and buddy, funny stuff. Well thats about it."

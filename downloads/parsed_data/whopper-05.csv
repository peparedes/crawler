1.	Yo mama is like a hockey player she doesn't change her pad for three periods.
2.	Yo mama's so fat the only time she sees 90210 is on a scale!
3.	Yo mama's so fat, she went outside and got stuck.
4.	Yo mama is so poor, I saw her walking down the street with only one shoe, and I asked her if she lost her other shoe and she said, ""No, I found one!""
5.	Your mom is so stupid, she threw a rock at the ground and missed.
6.	Yo mama's teeth so yellow when she smiles, cars slow down.
7.	The only difference between your mama and a washing machine is, after you drop a load in the washing machine, it doesn't follow you around!"

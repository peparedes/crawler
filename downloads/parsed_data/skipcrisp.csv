"event","I just got out of iowa.  I wanted to finish the rest of my last post but i got sidetracked by things going on in san diego.  by the way, its the greatest f'in place in the world.  the entire month i was there it was sunny and 72 degrees.  Submarine week was a lot of fun.  Subs are a lot roomier than you might imagine, except for your rack.  i felt like i was in a coffin that was on a gimble.  Anyway, we got to run around the submarine checking out all the areas of it.  we slept in between the thermonuclear missiles.  all i could think about was the fact that the large metallic tube i was in had the power to destroy an entire continent.  a little freaky.  the food was fantastic.  sweet and sour shrimp, egg rolls, lo mein, ice cream, pizza, etc.  basically, i got fat that week.  when not on the sub we were on land doing certain simulators. the wet trainer was the most fun as basically they put you in the bottom of a swimming pool that had a lot of pipes.  when we started, water hit you from every direction and you had to use clamps and other materials to plug up the holes in the pipes.   then they shut off the lights... which made it even more fun.  except for the blast of water in the pills.  that hurt... a lot.  a few more bullshit training areas and we were done.  then my favorite week, aviation.  we didn't fly the first two days.  first day was water survival training where you put on a flight suit and all your gear to see if you can still swim with it on.  that was a lot of fun actually, and treading water with all the gear + helmet + boots is really tough.  next day was more briefs.  the following day we got our flight in T-34s, which are old, but fun aircraft.  Single engine prop.  we got about 5 minutes of stick time.  inside the 30 mintues of the flight we did cuban eights, barrell rolls, aileron rolls, split-s's, wingovers and more.  most fun i've had in a long time.  next day we had SH-60B hops.  we went down to imperial beach for our flights.  I got to fly first in my group.  its a lot harder than it looks.  i don't mean to brag, but i got a real good compliment, and its my way of defending my geekiness when it comes to computer games.  i was hovering the helicopter when he switched off the 'magic', or flight assistance computers which help the pilot keep the helo more stable.  I actually kept it in a hover.  when we got back on the ground the crew chief told me i did better than some of the more experienced pilots do.  yes i know, i was just hovering, and yes, he could have been blowing smoke up my ass, but it made me very happy for the day.

the beach was every weekend.  i managed to peg a girl in the face with a football.  she wasn't that hot, but she had braces so i felt bad.  did a lot of swimming/beating the shit out of cottingham.  if you go to san diego, DON""T GO TO OCEAN BEACH.  very bad.  very very very bad.  

all in all, i know i want to be an aviator for sure now, and COTRAMID West 2005 was freaking amazing.  if you have questions, i would love to talk about it.  

oh, and i'm home tommorrow."

"event","I want to be stationed in San Diego when i get commissioned.  we have not had a single bad day of weather since I got here.  I had marine week first which was a lot of fun.  Got to shoot a .50 caliber machine gun, M249 SAW, M240G, M-16, and a Mark III grenade launcher.  we did a lot of other manly-marine type activities, some which can not be discussed in public.  It ALMOST made me want to be a marine, almost.  spent a lot of time at the beach... so far i've only managed to hit 1 girl in the head with a football.  she had braces.  i felt bad but i had to laugh.  I had surface week next which was boring as hell.  I was on LSD-42, which is an amphibious landing ship dock.  basically, the center of the boat is for tanks, AAVs, humvees, etc."

"event","My Five Songs: 
1. NOT Ari Hest - Goo Goo Dolls - Big Machine
2. Fuel - Shimmer
3. Stevie Ray Vaughan - Life By the Drop
4. Stevie Ray Vaughan & The Blues Brothers - Sweet Home Chicago
5. Gary Allen - Can't Do it Today

Yes, the last one is country... BITCHES.  What is with Ari Hest all of sudden?  Its just John Mayer redux.  It can't be because he's good at guitar, because then we would all listen to Stevie.  

4 more days... seems like forever.  i think when they make the exam schedule, they look at my schedule and summer plans and say ""Lets fuck this kid over.""  I HATE OSU at this point, but its the best university in the nation.  Now, I need to get some coffee, it was a good night last night."

"event","Jacob, a true Christian brother.  You always carried yourself in a righteous way.  i never got the chance to sit and talk with you as so many did... but we saw each other everywhere.  Jacob, like David, always did the right thing.  it just doesn't seem fair that the people who do things right are punished... but i know you are in a better place, one i one day hope to go.  you and david were the best of friends to me. Jacob, enjoy yourself up there buddy

"event","Never have a met a person that could live his life to the fullest for every single moment.  He always gave his best effort on every SINGLE THING HE DID.  He always had time for his friends, and never insulted a single person with malice.  It's safe to say he was a friend to all.  I've never wept so much in my life as i did yesterday.  I still cannot think of him as dead, and he never will be.  He lives on, and we will see him again, for he is with Jesus Christ.  I don't know about other people, but this is a big wake up call.  David died doing things correctly, doing it the right way, doing what he could do the best of his ability.  i have run out of tears, all i have is words.  he was great inspiration, and a great friend.  i love him as a friend, as a christian, and as a brother.  David Chu, i will carry you in my memories forever.  God has a greater plan than what we can see, lets rely on it
thanks david

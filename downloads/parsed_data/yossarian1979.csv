This isn't a please take me back message. This is a message coming from the bottom of my heart. I am laying in bed right now with your hoodie on just thinking about the good times we had how happy you make me. I fucked up many times and I am sorry. I know my actions didn't show I love you. I do love you John. I am sorry for what I put you through and you deserve better than me. This isn't me asking for you back. This is me saying I am sorry John. I really really really don't want you to respond to this. I have tears in my eyes. Thank you for everything John. For being here me. I hurt you but you were always still there for me. I don't know where I will be tomorrow or a week from now. I just want you know you will always be in my heart. I put the picture of you on my little board next to my computer so you will always be with me. John... Just... Thank you. Really thank you for just being you. I really didn't deserve you. Thank you for opening my eyes to the many things in this world. I love you John. Thank you.


this is whats written to me, making it crystal clear she doesnt want back...I dont think she knows, idk who she doesnt, but I dont think she realizes I dont want back... I think the games should stop. I have nothing more to say to her anymore. This weekend holds new horizons, I am done sitting and wallowing for someone filled with lies, someone that is basically been a stranger to me. Finding out she was using a snapchat the whole time... My best friend said a few things the other night to really get my head back on straight. I am glad I am starting to feel normal again....Here is to you Ricky, and your words of wisdom. Ull never read this, but u saved me a heart break....


You want my raw gut feeling?

yeah

I know you're hurt and the depression is choking the life from you right now. But you gotta let her go duder
My gut is saying that there's more hurt to come if you don't

The only thing that'll happen if you make her compromise is resentment


If you feel the need to hide dumb shit then you're probably gonna hide a lot more


and last but not least....


Like you said she ran away from the talks that needed to be had
That's a cheaters mentality
Instead of confronting emotion and hashing things out it's easier to console yourself in someone else than to be vulnerable and face each other


Thanks Julio Hernandez for being family to me. Sincerly my life wouldnt be the same without you. You are always here with me bro!"

"event","Sometimes I go back and read one of my friends entries. I read them due to having similiar feelings, though he articulates his thoughts in a way I cannot. I feel sometimes we write and hit a truth far greater than we truly know. I write to see who I am. I write to see the history of me growing, in the end, we realize we had it right at the starting line, but throughout the race, we lose the original epiphany, thinking its something deeper. Perhaps its really more simplistic? 

We try to uncover the shades and layers to see the core, but I have a deep feeling the core has always been there to see. I leave this entry with my friends post from years ago. This is for us that sometimes lose our way. We need to see things as they are, nothing more.


""It wasn't a day later, just later in the day

so begins another day. why does it always feel like i'm counting the days towards something. i realized that lately all i've been doing is putting up song lyrics and for now for this moment i feel like i have emotions i have desires i want to be. i've been thinking about all the things i want, and how i want to have it all.

today i was thinking about children. it has become clear to me that our understanding of the world, what's right what should be decays exponentially as we grow from adolescence and then only begins to ascend again once we are very very old. kids can feel untainted love, they understand theres no bad in the world because there really IS no bad in the world. bah bah bah. wasted words. right now, i'm thinking right now what i want, i close my eyes and i want the best words. i want the things that are good about me to be bad and the things that are bad about me to be, well. kids. i miss being a kid.

i think if i had one wish it would be to be a writer a good writer to impress no one but myself. i would write and read and repeat and never show anyone that part of me.

i want i want i want i want i want. is it possible to want too much, to reach the brim of your capacity to desire and then all of a sudden collapse in a heap of dirt....i think that was a question.

there is something out there that is everything i want, it's on these scales and on the other side is me waiting for everything to balance waiting for me not to be staring down at my fingers feeling like i can't accomplish anything lik ei can't run fast enough or please anyone. why does it have to be someone else. why not me. hey louie, what about me.

i'm done

Can we all bite the bullet and run around together happy? Or do we keep painting another unfinished picture that will never be complete? It all makes me dizzy.

"event","The times they are a changing. Ive walked a long way since my last entry. I have been through alot of changing and growing up since I last posted. Alot of my friends faces are different now. The names i once wrote about are memories that I will be hauling til they fade, just like the childhood memories I once thought were stored permanent. 

Its nice to cherish the people I have in my life. I couldnt imagine my life without Mingo, Jay, Kevbo, Beau, Smitty, Michelle, Val, and of course my lovely Sergio. There are some new names, and some old ones. I like to hope the old ones will stay with me til I go. 

This year I had resolutions and closures of sorts. I found out alot of things about my parents that I didnt recall really. Things that hurt me, made me feel ashamed. Coming to climb the fence was harder than the actual climbing. Facing the denials made me find myself in a sort of way. I like who i am, I dont think I have thought that too much in my life. I was afraid of being a monster, Im no monster, I was just a confused soul ready to lash out at hostile hands. 

The people I have met through my journey have given me knowledge, and perception of a reality i might not have been able to find on my own. Im glad im coming to terms with myself. Im glad im growing, its hard to grow when at points you get so used to pain that it becomes a crutch that makes you fold and crumble without it.

To all the people I may have touched along the way, Im sorry for any pain I have caused, and I forgive the pain caused on me, I forgive that some of you will forget me, I can still smile though because some of you will not forget me, some of you will stay on the ride with me til it finally stops never to start again.


Thank you all for making me the man I am today. Its time to look up, to breathe in the roads set out for me, and to make my choices, because til im dead I will always have a choice.

"event","Well to say how i felt, theres no words to describe. It made me feel like being in the movie waking the dead to an extent. On my first call for my ride-along I had to go to Gulf view mall because of 2 teenagers ODing. When we got to the scene there was a spectacle surrounding the 2 patients. We brought them to the ambulance and i ventilated the patient while the paramedic intubated the patient to clear the airway. All i gotta say was for a first call, it was fuckin nuts. The guy ended up still being in a coma when my shift came to an end. The next call we got was a car wreck on 19 and mainstreet. this wasnt so bad, the patient was just complaining of leg pains and we took her in. 
The third call was the mother of all calls. The call was a man fell down at Kanes furniture. We were the 1st rescue unit on the scene, i come running and see a ladder, it was about 12 feet up. I assumed the fall wasnt that bad, but then i looked by the ladder and there was no body near it, i go in for closer inspection and gasped as to what i saw. This gentleman fell 35 feet headfirst to the floor, fracturing his skull and hand. His bone to his thumb was protruding through the skin, he was just screaming in pain, but couldnt talk, blood was everywhere, we put a long spineboard onto him and positioned him so that we wouldnt move him too much, when we log-rolled him there was blood all over the floor, someone stated there was brain matter, but it was only blood clots, but as soon as i heard that my thoughts were ""HOLY FUCK THIS GUY IS GONNA DIE"" At that point i made sure to just let instinct take over and do whatever the fuck my guys wanted me to do. I actually kept my cool very well, i didnt do too much on this call, all i could really do was restrain the guy cuz he was trying to fight us and get up. I probably sweat off 40 lbs from that call, but my Paramedic said i did excellent and that i didnt freak out. Frankly I was very fuckin freaked out, not by the blood or any of that, truthfully that shit didnt bother me, it was the fact that i felt like for a situation like this no matter how much you read, it feels you dont know jack shit on what to do in a situation like that when you face it. It made me appreciate people in this type of profession tenfold. That night i came home wondering if this may in fact be not the job for me, but i realize its gonna take alot to become a true professional at this job, and in the end everyone who has this type of job loves it. I just need to learn the ropes and realize i put too much pressure on myself on my first day expecting that i should excel, hell maybe by the third ride-along ill actually be able to get a blood pressure in the truck =). 

All in all This is truly an underappreciated job, and the people you will meet in this profession are some of the coolest cats in the world.

Well apparently theres been alot of flak stating that the sequel ""Closing time"" sux, and if people would read more than the first 5 pages, they would find an extrodinary novel that people are too quick to write off. I have fallen in love with this book and its already exceeded my expectations  and im only halfway through. I was so afraid to read this novel due to all the negative reviews i heard, but now im glad i started it. Next up its to actually see the movie Catch-22 and pray that i dont hate that.

Ill let my being smile on the inside so i can crack the liars. In this world of no answers all i can do is stare at the sun with a sigh of final content. 

Sometimes i think we all like to forget who we are and disguise ourselves in the work that we do, or maybe the books and movies we read and see. Its nice to know besides all the molding i have from watching Television, that there is a nice hard shell that no one can touch but me, the center jelly mass of who I am. 

All in all Im excited to get some momentum going again, im happy to walk down the road again. I couldnt have done anything in my life without my loved ones that surround my life with happy thoughts and positiveness (yea not sure if thats a word). So thanks to you all for filling the mold for me to be a positive person. So thanks Corissa, Ming, Lou, Beau, Kevin, Serge,Shu, Dayu, and to everyone that has wanted good things for me, its much appreciated.

"event","Well i was in a slump in BJJ and MMA. I got pretty shaken up with this 300 pounder who would just toss me like a rag doll, I was pretty depressed, that is until tonight. 

Tonight i won the MVP, i was ran a 60 minute rolling session with only a ten minute break so it was almost straight through, I tapped 3 people , 2 with the anaconda choke, and one with a kimura from the guard. I ran the gauntlet for 15 minutes twice and didnt get tapped. I realize that i impress myself alot. Alot of people fall into patterns and routines, I truly always try to change mine up. I will give 2 examples about what happend tonight.

My first match was with Addison, and well i was in his guard, i was in for a good 2 minutes, then i advanced and got side-mount, now instead of going for submissions i switched it up. I started to just transition from good position to better, then go back, I ran up 40 points just transitioning from side-mount to mount, then to the other side getting side-mount, then i would get him in a scarf position, i could tell he was getting frustrated, then i gave him some room to bait him. I let him get into whats called the turtle position, then i applied the Anaconda choke on him and won, but what was most impressive about this match was my fluid movement on positioning, everyone shook my hand and congratulated me on such smooth movements, and said thats the best transitions they seen in a while.

second match that was incredible was against little brandon, we tangled up and fought to get the takedown, and instead of trying to dominate and get top position, i decided to pull guard, but heres the catch: i never pull guard, so i decided to through in a quick sub attempt while i did it, as i pulled guard i went for a kimura, got him in it, he rolled and i ended up tapping him with the same kimura in side-mount. Everyone was like WOAH, there was this new guy who looks like Ricco Rodrigez, he was so impressed with me and said ""man i want to be like you on the ground"" and it was the coolest compliment i have gotten thus far. I realize i keep on improving and adapting, if you stick with the same and dont evolve thats when you get caught. I actually did a Sakuraba jump over someones legs to get mount, everyone started clapping, it was amazing. I wrestled the most tonight and i was proud of myself of sticking to it, i ended up throwing up at the end, but it was all worth pushing myself.

Now here is the list of who i have tapped in class and who has tapped me, it gives a rundown of where i stand, and gives me goals to attempt to dominate.


People i have tapped                 peeps that tapped me       

Brandon                                Brandon
Justin                                 Justin
Jason                                  Jason
Landon                                 Dennis
Emanuel                                Will
Addison                                John
Rich                                   Rich
David                                  Dan
Dan                                    Sergio
Teddy
Dave
Sergio


Neutral
Jeff
Blake
Bill

now im pretty even with the ones that i tap and tap me, but will dominates me and John does as well, so i have to push myself to become better than them, train with a different strategy, overall im probably like 5th or 6th outta like 25 people so im not too upset, i just want to start gaining a more consistency and tapping different people.

Ok all enough for tonight, plz post comments cuz you love me.

this is Trent signing off."

"event","So the past class in MMA i was submitted by Will the gargantuan wrestler who took boxing for 8 years, It was during an exercise and i took him lightly and he caught me. I was real pissed by this, and it proceeded to fuck up my whole night and i kept getting my ass kicked by everyone. It seems my instructors dont see me as anything special anymore, i dont hear the ""goodjobs"" like i used to, or hear any sort of compliments, or any signs of me that im improving. I debated quitting, I had a long talk with Corissa (thanks for the advice) and Justin. Justin actually called me tuesday cuz he was annoyed that i didnt show up on Tuesday. I seriously thought my hobby/addiction was coming to a halt. Justin is going through the same feelings and turmoils that i am, we both are getting frustrated that we are at a standstill when it seems the people around us are improving.

Its hard to not have an ego, when no one thinks you are anythign worth while, meanwhile im tapping the people that are supposedly the aces of the class. I have something to prove, and i like proving it everyclass by beating the better ones, by upsetting them, I make them doubt their skills, I make them lose their confidence they once had when facing me. I like being the one who keeps proving himself every match, who keeps surprising his opponents, but now it seems its all being turned around.

Being in this class is like being an animal in the jungle, for example i was the zebra, i didnt have too many offenses but i would get out of holds and had good escapes, i slowly progressed to the hyena which while wasnt the best i could get positions, and my escapes were getting really crisp. Now i am in-between being the Lion, and the Hyena, I am slowly rising to the top area of our class and now i always have to prove something, when people call me out, when i call others out, when the new guys come in trying to take my head off, i always have to be on my A-game, even when injuries, or sores come along, Its soo much pressure, i feel it all melting away, and im slowly going downhill. I feel like whenever this fuckin tournament gets scheduled will be my true do or die day, the first tournament was to uphold respect towards my school, this tournament is for every shmuck that doubts me, and as well as for everyone that believes in me, for all those that see my sacrifices, for all those that havent seen any change, you can all witness who i am becoming.

I feel like these next weeks are my do or die for classes, and for the sport i love and have a passion for. Maybe im not as skilled as i thought, maybe i dont have the heart, but these next classes im gonna find all this out.

heres a song thats in my head when i think of all this.



Schism

I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing,
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.

I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesnt mean I dont desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication.

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
Ive done the the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication

Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion

Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers.

And I know the pieces fit."

"event","so today we had BJJ and it was me, Justin, Jeff (hes a football player who is kinda a body builder) and Landon who is 13 years old and is Jason's friend from class. Jason and justin im closest to in class, and i have to avenge my loss to jason but anyway heres the story.

Brandon the teacher was telling us how since there is 4 of us he wants to do the guantlet, The guantlet starts out with 2 people and every 3 minutes a new person takes over for 1 of them and the other person has to try and last 15 minutes. Well today he put a new spin on it, when he asked who wanted to start the guantlet me and Justin both said we did, so he changed the rules. He knows we are both competitive with each other, but he also knows that Justin is more technical, so he told us that we are gonna do a no time-limit match, and the winner stays in. Right after hearing that i got mentally prepared cuz i knew i could last many minutes without being tapped, so we start off and justin pulls guard and right away catches me with a choke, i escape trying to pass his guard. we stay like this for about 2 minutes, then he sweeps me and gets mount, starts leaning towards an armbar from mount, i sweep him and we are back in guard. He tries for the same sweep he did before and i base out (which means try to maintain balance) and then pass his guard into sidemount, from here i start to relax and put all my weight into him, he keeps trying to escape, and i told myself just relax right now he is wasting energy, so finally i see him tire out alittle, i go for full-mount, i succeed in getting it, as soon as i do he reverses me and he mounts me, he starts using his index finger knuckle and pressing it into my eye he ends up popping a blood vessel right by my eye, which is purple right now lol, but i still wouldnt tap, Brandon yells out damn this is a long match, but we continue and then i see my opening and reverse his position so im on top.

At this point i relax and start digging my two bent fingers right into his jugular, his face is turning purple and everyone is screaming in the class, finally he taps- total match time 17 minutes 22 seconds, longest match i have ever had. The significance? Justin went to the finals at the last in-house tournament, and a few classes ago the only people he said he was worried about was jeff and dennis, I think i just opened his eyes to why its no fluke when i win against him.

Next match Jeff, he is soo much stronger than me, he took me down at will and threw me around, but try as he might he was nowhere close  to making me tap, i let him do what he wanted, i reversed him a few times, but overall he woulda won the match on points, but i was already fatigued going into that match, so i get to stay in the guantlet.

Last match with Landon, he came strong but he is too green to the game, but amazingly he had a triangle on me that i almost tapped to because i twas too fatigued to get out, but brandon starts to yell at me to throw him, so i did, cuz i rather die than have brandon be disappointed in me, needless to say i stayed in guard alot of the fight and closed my eyes and tried to think of something more happier than being soo tired. I eventually heard justin say there was 1 minute left, so then i tried to overcome his guard, passing it then getting sidemount, i went for an opposite arm armbar and had it but the buzzer went, overall i survived 23 minutes of torture and didnt tap. I am gonna do good in this tournament, i can feel it."

I learned that two of your friends, one your supposed best and the other a girl of your dreams, can suddenly disappear and be replaced by a butch leather jacket wearing girl named Tori. Then they can magically reappear and yet Tori disappears. It is a frightening paradox

I learned that it is better to rely on your principal than it is to rely on his cool, but careless brother.

I learned that a family can change from episode to episode. Sometimes I have a brother, and sometimes I do not.

I learned there is no hope on dope.

I learned that ducks can melt your heart, especially when slathered in hot juicy oil.

I learned that behind a locker in every high school in America there is an old, but perfectly functional, radio station that used to be used by the principal when he was a hippie



ya those are true! i learned that no matter what, students always have an abundance of cash on them at any given time. like when zack and slater would pull scams and sell t shirts, zit creme, hall passes or whatever. i remember one episode they got one of the ""nerds"" to pay over 100 dollars for something, i think it was about slaters football jersey or something. anyway. they always had money. another funny thing is the music on thejukebox at the max never had lyrics. it was always this cheesy synthesizer-type music, and everyone would dance to it. dumb."

"event","So my head is hurting pretty bad lately, the chills, and burning ups have stopped but im just really bad congested, and cant seem to sleep cuz of all the stuffiness in my nose...things acomplished while sick so far.

1. Eating Carrot Casserole
2. Watching a movie i havent seen in a long ass time (Air America)
3. Watching Saved by the bell at like 6am today and realizing the Junior High episodes are by far the better, and actually quite humorous , being compared to the High School episodes, in matter of fact, the only thing better about the HS episodes was Tiffany Amber Theissen, but thats 1 big advantage.
4. Miss Bliss can dance like a mofo
5. Mr. belding was kinda cooler in the JHS episodes.
6. Movies that normally suck while sober, and alert, are quite entertaining while sick.
7. if house is left to yourself, first thing to do is spend money frivilously and throw house parties til you have no house, and no furniture.
8. If accomplish number 7, dont worry, just go sell insurance, then become straight and narrow, and your house will look better than before even when you started throwing parties.
9. Seth green played in some many b movies.
10. Looking up 1 of the weird shitty movies i watched this morning i noticed the actor plays the same name in like 30 of his movies, kinda weird.
that is all."

 I realize im close to a few of my classmates, and it feels like a family, cuz i know no matter what, they will have my back, and that we go through alot of ups and downs together with training and what goes on in our personal lives. It was definitely a bonding night (sorry that sounds cheezy as fuck) with all my friends from class, and from just work and whanot.

 Well heres to the hangover, and to the asskicking im gonna get tomorrow night at MMA! Yippee!~"

"event","So i was thinking about why i like fighting so much, and well here are a few explanations. I think one of the main reasons is the fear, the fear of being hurt, of someone wanting to impose pain on me, its a huge adrenaline high. Another reason is when i go and spar and shit, its not about who i disguise myself to be, everything is bare, im stripped to the bone, there is noone but me and my opponent, and we are the real people that hide inside our everyday lives, the beauty of conflict is high, and just you have no chance to wear a mask, this is who i am, and i rely soley on instincts and training. The last reason is while its fun to just dominate a match, the best matches are the real close ones, i have only had 1 real close one, the rest i either get dismantled or dominate, but the close one, i was getting lit up, but i was nailing liver shots and just kept working the bodys with low right hooks, and midsection knees, and finally he fell, and i got him in the turtle position and just landed knees to his shoulders, and liver shots and felt my confidence growing and growing til finally he tapped. The feeling that the fight was almost lost, but staying focused and toughing it out to work a victory made me proud of myself.

 I remember when iwas like 12 there was this kid that kept wanting to fight me for no reason, he just wanted to ""be cool"" and look good in front of his friends, so i was in my house and he kept ringing the bell and telling me to come outside so he can beat my ass, i remember being scared as hell, but my dad told me to get my shoes on and finish this so the kid doesnt bother me, I ended up beating the kid up and just not getting hit once, my dad watched from a far away view, and i felt real proud, i felt like i was on the top of the world. They say the highs are real high, and the lows are lowest of lows, but this sport makes you learn soo much about yourself, it makes you examine yourself as a human being, and the psychological aspects of dealing with a huge stress such as fighting is incredible. You tend to learn what you can make yourself do, and what limits you can push, and this is only the beginning for me, i cant wait to keep experiencing and learn more and more, its a great feeling.

Goodnight all."

"event","Well whoever wants to come to my in-house tournament in June it is free i believe, and i will make 2 promises.
1. I will give everything i have in there, and i will not lose lightly
2. this second 1 is kinda a funny thing, but if i get caught in a choke of any sort, i wont tap, i will fight til the second i pass out, i understand if i have a limb caught i wouldnt be able to do that, but being choked unconscious now 2 times, i kinda dont mind. The first time i got choked out, i was grappling my instructor, he pulled a gi choke on me, and i wouldnt tap, i just wanted to keep fighting, then i remember him saying my name and i woke up kinda shaking. At that point i actually felt relieved, I did something and i didnt quit, i just went in there and gave it everything and decided that i wouldnt quit. Thats gonna be my attitude for this one.

  Im the biggest underdog in this, and i might have it stacked against me on who i draw in the first round, but i will go down with guns a-blazing. If someone is gonna beat me, im gonna make sure they never want to face me again, and that they use everything they have on me, Its time to think and use strategies, my thinking game is whats gonna make me prevail, and i do quite well now, so i truly think i have a shot of taking this. Its all about the luck of the draw, and the determination im willing to give, The match will end with my hand raised, and from this moment on im gonna visualize this til the day of the tournie, and i will keep thinking that even if the lights are fading out above, I will prevail, I will do what i love to do, and take pride doing it.

"event","So i got an in-house tournament coming in June for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, im in the 185 and under class, i just have to cut 7 pounds, which is pretty easy with the time i have. I been taking MMA, and my body is breaking, and bruising, but when you want something, it always is better if you sacrifice things, they seem to make the sacrifices sweeter once you attained your goal. On a side note i decided its time for me to get a cellie, I need one to keep in contact with all my drug-deals, and for all my hoes to keep track of. In all honesty I just hate not having one, i feel like a cheap ass.


  I been taking personal trainer classes with my MMA coach, and he said in about 1 or 2 years i can get into my first match, but i want to speed it up, so im gonna give everything and hopefully i can do it. Everything else has been monotonous, and every day seems like another routine, but that is the jist of life i guess. On a side note, we must all pray for Mirko Cro-Cop to do good in this next Pride tournament, and we must all wish Matt Hughes the best of luck against Royce Gracie, ok I leave you with another shitty writing to ponder.



When you can squeeze the life right out
when the time comes for you to come along
Im not sure what i want to do
I can still see the sun around the bend

Waiting for another moment
wanting nothing more to say
Lying on the street today
just leave me alone

this morning i will be gone
never look back
i made things right
i just feel real drousy

sometimes, i just want to sleep
I dont want the line to break...."

I hope all of you have a great holiday, I will be around somewhere, but i must cope with certain issues at hand, i would like to leave you all with a token of wisdom, but have none.

Thanks to all that read, and everyone that posted comments, im sure i dont have much of an audience, but its been a blast for the years that i posted. Sorry to say i have nothing left i can post in here as of now. Thanks to everyone that put a smile on my face, and thanks to everyone that left feedback on here. I could only wish to give a better reason for my sudden cease of posting on here, but perhaps one day this place will be opened up again. Here are some quotes that i enjoyed, and figured what better place to put them.

""If I feel depressed I will sing.
If I feel sad I will laugh.
If I feel ill I will double my labour.
If I feel fear I will plunge ahead.
If I feel inferior I will wear new garments.
If I feel uncertain I will raise my voice.
If I feel poverty I will think of wealth to come.
If I feel incompetent I will think of past success.
If I feel insignificant I will remember my goals.
Today I will be the master of my emotions.""


Engrave this Quote   	 ""If the radiance of a thousand suns
Were to burst at once into the sky
That would be like the splendor of the Mighty one --
I am become Death,
The shatterer of Worlds.""

""The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep
And miles to go before I sleep."" 

""Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.""

and the last 4 from my favorite book


Catch 22-

""Let someone else get killed!"" ""Suppose everyone on our side felt that way?"" ""Well then I'd certainly be a damned fool to feel any other way, wouldn't I?"" ""Englishmen are dying for England, American's are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can all be worth dying for?"" ""Anything worth living for,"" said Nately, ""is worth dying for."" ""And anything worth dying for,"" ""answered the old man, ""is certainly worth living for.""

What would they do to me"" he asked in conidential tones, ""if I refused to fly them?""
""We'd probably shoot you,"" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen replied.
""We?"" Yossarian cried in surprise. ""What do you mean, we? Since when are you on their side?""
""If you're going to be shot, whose side do you expect me to be on?"" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen retorted.

Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out the window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot like other kinds of garbage. The spirit gone, man is garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.


""He had decided to live forever or die in the attempt."""

"event","So me and Brian S. have been sparring partners for about 2 weeks, and we train together in stand-up, and grappling. I must say hes a much better athelete than me. I feel we are both pretty even in both areas, if we were to stand-up i feel im stronger in close, but distance he has me, in grappling i feel that he has better top control and take-downs, but i have more knowledge and experience. Today we grappled and it ended up that i tapped 3 times, and i tapped him 3 times. One of the matches was a crazy three minute bout, that kept going back and forth with him controlling me on top, then me reversing, but ended up catching me in a guillotine choke that almost made me pass out. The move of the day though, I must admit without trying to sound  conceited but i caught Brian in a flying guillotine choke. Now this move is about as hard as it sounds, it requires you to get ur foe in a guillotine, flip one leg over his back, push ur other leg up in the air and wrap it around ur other leg while falling back. This is all in 1 motion, its a real fuckin cool feeling getting that on someone though. 

I realized i have a huge problem with taking Brian down, i have cat-like reflexes when he came to take me down a bunch of times, but i like pushing peoples heads toward my shoulder when i grapple, but he is way taller than me so it renders that move useless, so i continually have to out-muscle him on upper body throws, which earlier it was dead even but then i was getting dominated as the day wore on.

hold that thought dog needs potty. K well im thinking of getting into Karate in January. Since the closest Jiu-Jitsu class is about 70 miles i figure its time to train in something, even though its not the one i wanted. I have been trying to drop weight to get in shape for pigging out on Christmas, and for being more agile when it comes to submission holds, i started at 215, which completely sux ass, but now im down to 202, gunning for 185 by Christmas, hopefully all my goals will be accomplished.

Til next time its been a good day, and Brian congrats on giving me my toughest matches and tapping me out 3 times, but next time its going to be even harder for you as i keep trying to evolve my ground game."

"event","I had gotten done watching the movie I heart Huckabee's a few days ago and promised myself that i would deliver a post about it. This movie was probably one of the most underrated movies i have seen, the dialogue is hilarious and comical, but also has a very serious message in general throughout the whole movie. I can see why some people might not like this movie, but at the very least i think everyone should check it out."

"event","So Nine Inch Nails is coming to Florida in about 3 weeks.I have soo much excitement and anticipation inside me i can burst. This is the main band for me, nothing in the world can compete with them in my eyes. I have been a fan of Trent's for about 8 or 9 years now, and saw them live during the Fragility tour, and let me say this; there is no experience like seeing Nine Inch Nails live.

I am bias yes because i have been a huge fan for way back when, but when i first saw the show, it was like when i was a kid going into my first haunted house, the excitement and fear made me not want to even breath. The show brought up soo many emotions for me, i go through every sort of feeling by the time the last song finishes. The music holds alot of meaning and memories to me, alot of which was hard to bear back then, but now i see it as making me the complete adult i am. If there were to be 1 concert outta the 50 i have been to, that i would recommend to a friend, then it would be this one.

Im trying to remember what the bands playlist was when i saw them, as far as i can remember these are the songs i know they played.

i mighta missed 1 or 2 but that was the overall show basically. im actually going to check and see if i ever wrote a livejournal back in the day when i seen NIN. 


PS- Louie, write a comment of what you thought of NIN when you saw them with me. It would be greatly appreciated since a few of my friends are going with me, that have yet to see them."

"event","Well last Sunday i was amped up for the Pride GP finals, and the fight of the century. I had some friends over we drank talked, lit cigarettes, drank some more. It was a pretty good evening overall. About the 3 grand story well most of my associates already knew, but in case youre reading this and havent heard about this I will go into explanation.

About 4 months ago i made 2 bets on 2 fighters, 1 who is undefeated and the Middleweight champ, the other was a huge underdog, but i watched his fights and felt he could take the whole thing. I put a hundred each on them, and well there were alot of doubters on the underdog, which if he woulda won i would win three thousand. Well they both made it to the Semi finals which there they would face each other to see who would go into the finals.

So now that brings us back to Sunday. As the first fight came to a close I started to get nervous because the next fight was the fight my money was on to see who would go into the finals. Now keep in mind i had money on both fighters so i wouldnt be dissappointed on who would advance, but I was definitely rooting for Arona (the underdog) to beat Silva (MW champ) to advance because everyone was banking that i was gonna eat my words and Arona would lose to him.

As the stare-down ensued the whole room of people were on the edge of their seat, i was about ready to urinate on the person next to me(which was a sober Brian, who prolly wouldnt have found that very entertaining), so the fight starts and Arona gets about 4 unanswered low-kicks, which had me in a state of a frenzy, I about wanted to scream just to see some kinda reaction....then my dreams came true, as Silva went in for another low-kick this time Arona countered with one of his own, who made Silva fall on his back from the power combined with Silva being alittle off balance made Silva disoriented, and as soon as that happend Arona landed in his guard, and proceeded to throw powerful strikes towards Silva's head. the round ended in that same position.

So now im pumped and pretty happy and as the bell rings for the final round I feel alot more confidence run through me, but now there was a change in Silva's fighting style, as the round started Silva started to threw some wild hay-makers and proceeded to land a few to make Arona seem to be in a daze. at this point i was going to cry, As Silva smelled the tide changing he went in for the kill,  but then something miraculous happend, as Silva went to throw a huge combo, Arona nailed him once knocking Silva back, which gave the chance for Arona to shoot for a double-leg takedown and proceed to throw some wild-ass haymakers which didnt land that much, but controlled the agression of the fight in Arona's favor, as the round proceeded to close I knew i had won this fight, but the battle was not over. As the ref pulled off Arona from Silva, Arona had gotten his last revenge by yelling and smiling right in Silva's face which pissed him off to no-end.

The next fight in the semis went exactly as i predicted but was hoping for a different outcome. This fight was with Shogun (Silvas camp mate, and sparring partner) He dismantled his opponent for the most part with little trouble (exception for a guillotine that he almost got caught in).

So before the finals they had the fight of the century, which by all means lived up to the hype. I am a huge huge fan of Mirko Cro-cop, but for once in a very very long time he was a big underdog to the reigning champ who is undefeated for 7 years Fedor Emalianko. The fight was going back and forth in the first round until one deciding factor that changed the whole course of the fight.Mirko landed a huge left straight and right punch, then Mirko threw his signature left high-kick which for most opponents would render them unconscious, but not this time, he threw it in haste and didnt land cleanly and as he brought his leg back Fedor grabbed it causing Mirko to fall back, and proceed to get ""grounded & pounded"" throughout most of the 1st round, but as Fedor was landing some shots, I noticed that Mirko has the best open-guard ive seen, especially for someone who isnt a grappler. He was landing some up-kicks and punches to the head with actual power in them.

After the first round the faces of the fighters were extremely different, and if you went by just pictures of their faces you would think Fedor was losing. Mirko had about 1 scratch on his face, but by far was losing all his fuel trying to prevent subs from the ground. The next 2 rounds were more 1 sided with Fedor taking Mirko down more and doing more of the same, but this time the stand-up battle changed pace to Fedor with him landing lots of bodyshots where i thought Mirko was going to quit more than 1 time. I was very happy with both performances, and wasnt upset that Mirko lost, but I have a good feeling the rematch will be quite different.

Now was the time, the only fight left was the finals. My only true worry was that Arona expended an amazing amount of energy on Silva, which was my worry since the semis were announced. As the fight got underway it couldnt be more one-sided, Shogun threw some leg kicks and proceeded to beat the piss outta Arona for the first minute, then there was a glimmer of hope when Arona went for a takedown, but it turned out to be the last nail in the coffin, cuz Arona landed horribly and injured his shoulder, as he laid there Shogun went in for a couple of foot-stomps to Arona's head, which he dodged well, but then the hammer fist landed right to Aronas temple and rendered him unconscious. The night ended on such a downnote, and my friends probably thought i was upset, but its dumb to think, that i was more happy in predicting Arona to beat Silva that all the disappointment went right away, knowing i have some good knowledge of the sport, and even though there isnt money for 2nd place my predictions went almost all the way, and i was proud of that. 

Its weird how addicted i truly am to this sport. Its like the stereotype for football for guys, is the way this sport is to me. Theres something about seeing a Rocky movie come to life right before your eyes without a pre-determined ending that makes this sport really a sight to see. Some people call it brutal, while others call it boring, but for the hardcore fans out there, such as Ryan, Robby, Mike, and Jeff from www.sherdog.com it is life."

"event","So my girlfriend, who i love and care for very deeply moved to NC, now fast foward a few weeks and she moved back!!! walla im a true fuckin magician! It sucked for the time she was gone, but now that she is back everything is whole once again.


Oh and there was a definitive road trip here between me and brian seamon. We drove for 24 hours straight with an hour break. Needless to say it was fuckin nuts. I shared alot of thoughts with him and whatnot, and this guy is truly in my best of friends group. I know this sounds cheezy as fuck but if he murdered someone i wouldnt turn him in. He helped me out of a hard time, and then proceeded to break bread with me after we got back and showered. We helped ourselves to some Bacardi razz, and some good ole cheap vodka. It was one of those times where you know that this guy is like your brother cuz everyone around you is sipping their drinks with that horrendous look like the planet fuckin Pluto just landed on my nose as me, and my partner fuckin chug the shit outta glass after glass.

So we were all sittin telling stories, and i remember at one point thinking...""wow you know what would make these stories about ten times better? more alcohol!""
At this point i was losing track of the people who were there, it felt like there was a spotlight on me, mingo and brian, and the rest were our audience. So i tried my new material, and then i remembered i never had old material, so i did what we in the biz called IMPROVISE. so i was working on my one-liners, and i looked over and brian was talking to some femme, so i decided hey lets try to drain the bottle...after drinking that, it felt like someone spiked my vodka, cuz i was FUCKED! i remember taking about 100 percent effort to look over at brian and realized he was still talking, but now there was no female there...in matter of fact no one was there, but i didnt want to interrupt him, cuz it seemed he thought he had his audience mezmerized. I looked away and stared at the sink, and the thought of Bill Cosby saying ""Choclate Pudding"" came into my head and made me laugh, as the laughing subsided the vomit that was forming in my throat said ""HEY LET ME THE FUCK OUT"" came up, and proceeded to clog and fill the sink.

Now this is where the story gets sketchy and there are various versions, but what happend to me was i spilled the half filled bottle of green flavored vodka in the sink, and while in my comatose state i took it out hoping some shmuck would end up drinking the new green vomit flavored vodka, but with my current state i realized the only ass gobbler stupid enough to have fallen for it woulda been me if someone hid it for a minute then presented it to me in all its beauty. Then i remember jay taking care of me while Brian proceeded to go under the gun of alkie poisoning...he got me to my bed and i passed out.....

there are 2 morals to this story

1. dont let fuckin canadians take sexual advantage of you while ur passed out...oh did i forget to mention that part? well its cuz i was about dead, and my canuck friend beau came over (he is the type that while youre trying to take a piss, he wants you to give him a golden shower) proceeded to massage my asshole, and try to get his canadian bacon in my blackest of holys.

2. when all else fails, you and your best friends can fuck up 1 night, but have a story like this live on forever! 

This story is brought to you by the true soldiers of the night

purple heart- John Mahoney
Medal of Honor- Brian Seamon"

me vs pete e. - victory by kimura


i notice when i grapple that i never try to improve my weaknesses so now im gonna list what i think are some of my weaknesses and strengths.

weaknesses - too passive, not enough instinct on going for sub attempts, need much much better cardio ( yea i need to quit smoking) need to go for more takedowns and try to not get tired on the stand up area.

strengths - great at finessing holds onto people, good at trying different subs to learn how to apply them better, such as triangle, anaconda chokes, and leg locks. good at escapes, and maintaining positions.


oh yea tomorrow early on im getting NIN tickets, fuckin A and now my gf is living with me which is yet another awesome thing."

"event","Well, i just finished off going over my friend mingo's house and showing him Shaun of the dead, and Session 9. Althought Shaun was a great movie in its own right, Session 9 is a fuckin great creepy, and very uncomfortable feeling flick. By uncomfortable feeling i mean when you watch a movie and it just gives you the utter creeps. I watched that movie two days ago and it kept me up thinking about some of the shit that happens in that movie. I would recommend this film for people that like unique scary movies instead of the usual hack and slash movies. If anyone has seen it out there let me know your opinions."

"event","Well i hope everyone enjoyed their holidays, and everyone was safe. I went and saw Meet the Fockers on New years eve, and spent time with my love. We rented two movies that night and had a cool time. We watched Touching the void, which is about two ice climbers that are pretty much fuckin crazy and they go somewhere in Peru to climb a huge ass mountain and well one of them falls through a crevice and is hanging tied to his friend, who doesnt realize what happend, and has to decide whether to cut the chord, which unbeknownst to him will lead to a 300 ft. drop. Its pretty much a documentary so it made it that much more fucked up. it gets 3 outta five stars from me.


 The other movie i watched was Garden State which is probably the best movie i have watched in quite a long long time (thanks for the suggestion lou). That whole movie was great and just had gotten me more absorbed as i continued to watch.

 Well I hope everyone had a great time on their holidays, oh yea and i bet on vanderlei silva to win in his last fight which was two nights ago, and proceeded to lose 250 dollars. Have a good one all."

I look at the city every single day with wonder and delight, as it is a sight to behold. But the city is nothing compared to the surrounding landscape.  I have seen magnificent waterfalls, roaring from birthing peaks into a vast river valley below.  I have climbed up a Western Hemlock tree to see the forest canopy from above.  Dangling from only a rope I witnessed the nurturing sun bath all the glorious species in the forest. I have plunged into the deep aqua waters of Opal Creek, screaming as the water held me with its icy embrace.  I have been 9000 feet in the air soaring on my snowboard too distracted by the view to stand up. And on most days, I hike in the largest city park in the US.   I am truly a lucky girl!!!  I feel like I belong here.  I am addicted to the ocean and the mountains.  To the cool damp winters and the cool damp summers*giggle*"

"event","i have a wonderful chow mix that i believe is truly a friend. I am glad beyond words that he was handed to me at Petsmart (i worked there at the time). I know that he looked up at me and wimpered momma, because I had said no to litterally hundreds of needy pets before him. He had a SERIOUS temperment issue and would bite, growl, and corner people whom he did not like. He had been abused and mistrusted humans, especially humans with food for a long time. It has taken alot of patience for us to show him that he is safe with us. Still to day there are rules that he has set out to any strangers. NO touching the ears. NO alcohol abuse. NO restraining my head. NO hurting my momma!!! I allow him to keep his rules, he does not get punnished for acting out when a stranger is drunk, i ask the stranger to leave rather than the dog. He is my pal, he has his rights and i will not attempt to change anymore of his behavior. He knows that I am his friend, he trusts me, he minds me knowing that he is safer for doing so. He cuddles with me every night and me and my partner always make sure that someone is in the house aside from a few hours a day. For the first time he did not growl at the vet last week, he is sick and i think that he knew that it was time to have certain unpleasant things done to him in order to get better. 
I very much fear what would have happened to him had been given to someone else."

to one that knows who the hell he is.  you are amazing, your growth and wisdom inspires me.  where i once saw a weakness i now see strength beyond words. i hope that we share many more words for years to come.  there is something to be said about a friendship that in age still captures your attention.  i am so happy for you and your budding life and love.  may you and your beloved rest easy until your hearts can reunite...omg i am sooo gushy at 4am!!!

to the love of my life.  i am glad that your feet still wiggle when i come into the room as you sleep. 

to the two new girls
ba.  to meet a like mind who can talk about brain anatomy as if we were discussing the weather, i am just stunned.  you are beautiful and intelligent, i hope we get to spend some biogeeky time together soon. i am so happy to have a friend that doesn't involve code and software or just records.
 
mi.  i only wish that i would have gotten to spend this much time with you last year.  i am only beginning to know who you are but i already value your strength.  do not fear your ability to be independent, you already are.  i am at your dispose for anything you need here to get started.   

si.  i hope that you find what you are looking for.  i only wish that you could learn to trust and rely on your friends.  there are many people that are out here that love you, love you more than could ever be conveyed by words.  so much more to say, but somehow i don't think the words would penetrate what you are feeling, so when you are ready to hear it like it is, find me."

"event","Oh i had HORRIBLE dreams last night, it is the first time in awhile that my parents were in them.  First i had some sort of stalker following me, and he had started doing some heinous stuff, like ruin a project of mine and tear up some possesions.  I told him coldly to leave and thinking i was sooo tough didn't think he would do anything but leave.  But he didn't, he went to the kitchen and strangled my mother to near death.  I came in to see him sitting with her talking to her and she had the cord wrapped around her neck still.  I remember coming in and shaking her....she looked dead.  I unwrapped the cord and i kept yelling, ""mom mom mom"" then she just said, ""hello, i think i am having problems remembering""  
I picked her up and got her on her feet...she just shuffled about me leading her to HIS car and then i didn't want to put her in it and go and get the keys....i didn't want to leave her again, but i couldn't take her back in there.  She looked at me and opened her hand, and right there she had his key.  I took it and rummbled out of the driveway with her in this old classic car, a green nova or something, which is strange because now i remember they had one of those when i was born. And I got her to the hospital but i think it was too late to save her brain, and he came there, the stalker, and acted like he had done nothing.   

the other dream was shocking but not nearly as vivid.  I found out that beatpusher was sleeping with some guy, and that guy really loved him or something.   Very strange dreams."

<killshot> i told her yes...
<Scola> good answer.
<killshot> its not meat....
<killshot> but i wouldnt really call it vegitarian
<queek> good answer indeed!
<Scola> it sure as fuck isn't vegetable is it
<Scola> it is an animal product strictly speaking.
<killshot> ya... and it is made of little living organisms
<maeda_studies> actually
<Scola> well... not exactly.
<maeda_studies> they are potential organisms
<Scola> right.
<killshot> ya
<killshot> i suppose
<maeda_studies> uhh huh
<maeda_studies> so 1/2 life
<killshot> they are a little living..
<killshot> because... they move
<maeda_studies> w/o the egg they are nothing but wriggling cells of yourself
<Scola> it really depends on if the girl was a vegetarian for dietary purposes or for animal friendliness reasons.
<maeda_studies> movement is only one facet to living
<maeda_studies> there are many more
<killshot> dietary purposes..... as was i
<killshot> but now i eat fishies and birds
<killshot> but no cows and piggies
<Scola> oh... well, then yeah.  I'm afraid that the sperm is not vegetarian.
<Scola> cows and piggies are delicious.
<maeda_studies> hmmm
<killshot> they are icky
<maeda_studies> sperm is too veggie
<maeda_studies> well
<maeda_studies> she is actually eating little bites of killshot
<Scola> wow.
<maeda_studies> but she is doing the same as she is kissing a killshot
<Scola> There's a marketing hook.
<maeda_studies> cuz killshot cells get in her mouth
<maeda_studies> and those cells even have a complete set of dna
<Scola> hey, you should put out a raverporn breakfast cereal.
<Scola> called ""Little Bites O' Killshot""
<killshot> now with complete daily allowance of DNA!
<maeda_studies> and it could be crispy flakes covered in killshot spooge
<killshot> no milk needed!
<Scola> yes,,, I was hoping we could use toasted corn shaped like sperm.
<Scola> it would make both production AND marketing a hell of a lot easier.
<killshot> hmm.. imagining seeing someone eating a big bowl of cum covered corn flakes
<killshot> i saw a girl brushing her teeth with cum on a site once..
<maeda_studies> hrm...
<Scola> that's nice.
<killshot> i wonder if it cleans teeth good
<killshot> it would need some sort of abrasive in it
<Scola> i would guess not.
<maeda_studies> pwerhaps
<killshot> i should come out with a whole line of cum based products
<Scola> considering that it is JIZZ
<maeda_studies> protein is good
<maeda_studies> i have heard of jizz shampoo
<killshot> toothpaste, shampoo, ceareal, hair gel.....
<maeda_studies> protein enriched with sperm"

What's holding up is a mirror.
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn this piss to wine.

They're both totally void of hate,
But killing me just the same.

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Considerately.

Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Drags me down like some sweet gravity.

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been.
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again.

And I feel this coming over like a storm again.

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,


Without the skin,
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears
The walls came down.

And the snake is drowned and
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times.

I could have cried then.
I should have cried then.

And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
and will die.
It's all right.
I don't mind.

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,"

In a little bit we're going back to their house for dinner. I went tubing for the first time today...OMG it was so fun but soooooo scary! I went 3 times with Alexis, the first time&nbsp;I stayed on but Alexis fell off, the second time we both stayed on and the third time&nbsp;I fell off. It was 2 seperate tubes being pulled at once. I've never had the guts to go tubing but i'm glad&nbsp;I did! The third time was sooooo choppy so alexis and I both went into the wake but it was even worse! lol...It was really freaky when u wiped out though! I'm so tired though *YaWnInG* </FONT></STRONG></P>

(Swept means won all of them) It was a tie game most of the time&nbsp;3-3 and in the 12th inning redsox scored one run. The Yankees soon came up 2 runs when John Farhety Got&nbsp;an RBI Double..Usually John isnt good with the bat. It was amazing!!The game went into 13 innings and i got home at&nbsp;1 in the morning. Jeter and A-rod made amazing plays! Jeter went to cath a fly ball and he Flew into the crowd FULL SPEED to catch the ball. He was bleeding and had to get stitches but he still made the out!! A-rod made an amazing play also!! He caught the ball on a bad hop, stepped on third, threw it home, and&nbsp;Posada threw it to second. The only reason it wasnt a triple play was cuz the guy that ran to third was the same guy that ran home. It was great! I had one of the best nights of my life...They say that that's been the best baseball game this year and maybe even in like 3 years! It's Great. Padro Martinez started for the Red sox and every yankee fan hates him so whenever someone on the yankees would score a homerun the crowd would tease him and we'd all go Paaaaaaadro Paaaaaadro it was soooooo funny! And also the crowd would cheer 1918, 1918 cuz thats the last time the red sox won the world series....So in the end, the Yankees won 5-4 and swept them away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahahaha i had a great time! Well i gtg ttyl xo mwa</STRONG></FONT></P>

I really miss Brett :'-( Camp is AWESOME! I go to Teen Treks. Today was my 2nd day. Yesturday we went to some cool arcade place and today we went to the ""science center"". Yesturday was really fun, there was this cool laser tag and i got the most shots on my team! And councelors were on my team i was like omg!! Lol it's in my jenes. The science center was Ok, they were really strict but there was this REALLY cool 3D show (i know it sounds dorky) lol. There was also this pitch black tunnel and it took 5 minutes to get out of and it had curves and it was supposed to show u what it would be like if u were blind. It was sooooo scary but sooo cool!!!! Nat, Christina, and Cathy were in front of me but they were faster so i had to lead Casey and Caroline omg it was soo freaky and i kept on getting trapped and the tunnel kept getting smaller. It was cool&nbsp; but sooooo freakin' scary! The bus ride there was awful we got stuck in traffic it took us about, 2 hours!! I sat with Elena which was fun. The way home went quicker. Elena, Cathy, Natalie, and I all played B.S. and the last game took soooo long cuz we kept on losing and getting more and more cards until one of us had practically the whole deck and them someone else would lose and get a lot. It was so funny. Then all of us went to sleep and it made the ride seem shorter...lol. When i got home i went out for pizza with my mom which was fun. I can't wait for tomarrow!! I get to go to a Yankee Game with my daddy...It's gonna be so fun. I'm watching tonights game right now, Yankess Vs. Red sox...Yanks' down by one and its the third inning. Last night the Yank's KILLED the Red sox....it was funny :-D! Well i'm gonna go, ttyl mwa!! Brett i miss u sooo much!!</FONT></STRONG></P>

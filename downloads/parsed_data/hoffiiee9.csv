And I really don't know what to say.  I suppose I owe you an ""im sorry"" if those words really mean anything anymore, they are way to overrated, used to much, become meaningless really.  But I could never truely say that it was a complete lie, cause it wasn't alot of it was real and I think that you know that to, alot of it still means alot to me, but I guess I have moved on, not saying that I am gunna forget or wipe it out of my mind cause I believe thats nearly impossible.  I have a piece of you, I always will and I am pretty damn sure that goes both ways.  I know we will always be friends at least I hope, why I dunno I just have the feeling.  I don't wish you a good life cause I wanna hear about it everyday..."

Ohh yeah and what, Stammler is ummm....MY PHYSCO PATH NEIGHBOUR....ya i think he is just a little nuts!  And what about that English teacher, Murray-Somthing-Someing all wearing short ass tassled skirts lol!  Yeah and just checking up on this little mental note, I still feel totally left out @ school, its so weird, just like im visiting like I don't really belong or have a place there, and its pissing the hell out of me, I know ppl are trying to be nice, but its just not the same.  Whatever I miss my old friends SOOOOOOOOO MUCHH!!!  Brandons friends are cool, most of the guys I get along with, but its so much like im not pretty or old enough for those girls so w/e makes them happy as if I care.  Some of the gr 11 guys are amazin and some are um, well yeah assholes.  The whole school thing makes me want to just to everything by myself and sit in a corner or somthing, whatever I probably sound retarded but its honestly depressing me.  Yeah and then thank god for hockey, like the one thing that I can do my way, I have friends, respect, and a ton of fun, its basically the only thing I look forward to anymore.  Work is just a dread day to day, but I mean its work, so what do u expect, nothing more nothing less.  HAAA @ least there are some entertaining people there now lol, wow some crazziiiiee nights @ work.  Maybe things will get better when I move to Kingsville, though I doubt it that just means that I am farther away from my friends in Essex, PERRRFECCCTTT! I could so just like sit in my room all week and not do anything, thats how much life sux, i'd rather be in there by myself.  Ughhh magazines are gay, perfect this, perfect that, fix this...look like a star.  If I wanted to look like someone in one of those magz i'd go waste my money, fucking modeling company called me AGAIN, hmmm I told them no 3 times wtf honestly...I had enough of that crap! Yeah a best friend would be nice right now, well any friends for that fact, god stuff sucks.  Anyways I am either out of words or going to listen to Foamy The Squirrel lol SQUIRRELLY WRATH lmao o boyyyyyy

"event","So this is what I get, you know what I honestly change my mind again, I think the new school, work, and everything that has been happening again is terrible, I want nothing to do with it, maybe i'll fail all my classes this year on purpose, I want to start a new rep, there ya go.  So I guess that religion is going to screw up my entire life right, cause thats sure how it looks right now.  So lets lay down a few of the rules that I heard are suppose to be followed actually just got lectured for the last 2 hours about them, bet ya I broke 90% of them but hey we shall see.

#1  Dress Modest - Not that I try to dress slutty but the whole, cover everything to protect yourself from evil, just doesn't fly with me.

#2  Do Not Let Guys Touch You Sexually Unless You Plan To Marry - Well I killed that a while ago, and apart from what my mother would like to think, no she doesn't know everything.

#3  Attend Church - Well on a first note I don't see why it is mandatory because why do you need to prove that you believe in God by singing about him infront of a crowd of a 100 ppl.  And besides that, yes it may only be an hour long but maybe I want to spend that hour in a different way.

#4  Respect Your Parents - I do respect my parents and I do love them with all my heart, but I do no respect every decision they make, and who says that they are ALWAYS right cause sometimes they aren't.

#5  Be Around Christian People - Well I don't have a problem being around Christian people I mean I am Christian, but I don't see why I need to follow all of these rules.  And why can we not give other ppl a chance, apperently unless you are Christian since you were 5 then you are no good.  Does that mean that every other person in the world is bad?? To my mother apperently.  Maybe I like someone thats not a Christian, maybe someone of a completly different religion...what are they going to do, not much they can.

#6   Try To Spread The Faith - I don't think that myself or anyone else has the right to go around trying to change someone else's life if they wanted to beleive in this stuff then they would I don't need to be pushing my parents opinions on someone else I mean I know what it feels like.

I don't see why it is such a big deal like really, if its that important then I will do it but they just cant change everything about me, its just not possible.  So then all these gay fights just make me change my mind about everything, no I have like no desire to meet new people or do new things.  I just want my life to be normal and it seems that it never will be unless I lie and I guess thats what it is comnig to cause I don't get my way any other way so hopw many choices does it leave me?  Also there are way to many guys for my own good I give up, I am losing my best friend, I really hope that I don't I am trying to make things better, but how fast is fast enough?

"event","Why does this happen to me everytime?  I swear all life deos is go in circles for me one thing leads to the next and the next and the next and then your back at the beginning again!  I don't see why I even try @ all to do things the way I'm told to because it never gets me anywhere, but then again if I don't I don't get anything out of it either, so where does it get me really...nowhere at all.  So I get 90's in school, I play travel sports, I work full time, and help my parents out around the house, but is that good enough...nope!  O well I guess there isn't much I can do about it eh.  So the new school thing is looking up for a change I guess somtimes I don't really give things time to play out before I assume they are going to suck lol.  I dunno I guess I know some ppl there and everyone is telling me that they are sure I will have no problem finding friends, so thats an upside I guess.  Right on so dad is working in Toronto again so he will be home every weekend I am not so sure if that is a good or a bad thing yet, cause things always get tense around here when he gets home, not that I don't want to see him, cause thats not it at all I suppose its just break of routine.  Omg lol brandon is a cutie, he is so innocent about how he does everything its like soo amusing lol.  Thats cool I am actually liking all the people that I have to work with except for the ""Unspoken"" few.  Makes the time go by quicker when you are working with ppl that you like, speically mel lol alot of ppl don't like her I guess, but she just always makes me laugh I dunno I get along with her well!  Haha died my hair red, that didn't go over well with the rents, haha not that it matters whats done is done!  I love it tho I actually think that my hair looks good for once!  Wait actually I think that I look good for once all together and that is def a first considering I always thing that I look bad.  Haha maybe I can make a good impression in k-town lol that would be cool.

I guess this is what you get for having differnt opinions, this was my reply to my ""best friends"" comments that I can see she enjoys posting about me on the internet so why not right...

Yeah okay I am sure that by the name of this message you know who this is...and if not I guess its your ""best friend"" past tense you know what I mean right...well I am sorry that your life is going so bad for you right now, but I have like just got mine into check and going the way that I want it and I am trying really hard not to mess things up, and like you used to get what I meant but I don't think that you do anymore...just because I can't hang out with you in the summer is no reason to get all pissy, you know I have been working my butt off 6 days a week this summer and when stuff like that happens I only have one day a week to do everything else that needs done, so don't act like I have been partying and hanging around my house doing nothing, not to mention that fact that you live so far away and its like impossible for me to sleep anywhere for the night cause 99% of the time I have to work the next day. Besides that even stacey who lives say 5 min away from me has only seen me like 3 times this summer for like a couple hours in the afternoon, its not just *you* although you think that it is, cause I haven't been hanging out with anyone this summer @ all, and I don't care what the makes me. And somthing that pisses me off the fact about my birthday and yours, first off I did invite you to my birthday so I don't know what the heck you are talking about because I did you told me on the phone that you dad wouldn't let you come that weekend, so what exactly did you want me to do, I would have much rather had you there then half the people that were there and you know that, but whatever makes you happy saying that I didn't invite you and stuff thats cool, and your birthday you already know the reason why I couldn't come to yours on the first day and the second time I worked my ass off that morning and my mom wouldn't let me come which you obviously realize and you know I don't exactly see how that is my fault, cause your dad wouldn't let u come and my mom wouldn't let me so doesn't it run equal both ways...or am I like totally off base here???? Yeah I am sorry that I wasn't here the other night I don't see how that was such a big problem like I have called you before when your not home...whatever. Look I think basically the whole sum of this is that me and you are going in two totally different directions...I'm sorry but its true and you know it is, don't tell me that you haven't figured that out by now. But don't start this crap about our friendship being a bunch of lies, cause god knows thats not true, I don't even know where you would come up with a comment as good as that one, like honestly, what have I lied to you about, other then stuff that you want to believe is a lie even though its not whatever I don't need you to believe me, if you don't want to then don't, but our friendship that we had was no lie, it was a true as they get, you helped me through alot of stuff and I am in no way trying to say that you didn't or that your worth nothing my point is not to put you down but to make a point, don't try and make it look like its all my fault I am just doing what I need to right now. And just on a personal note I don't think the drugs and the ""carefree"" attitude are helping you much, things have gotten alot better for me and I think they could for you if you changed some things, but I guess I am wrong right...cause thats ""cool"" and the easy way to get rid off all your problems for an hour, don't tell me either that you can't do it and your not a good person or your not worth anything cause me and you both know otherwise. If your mad @ all about me and stacey hanging out and stuff and if thats what makes you think I am lieing I am sorry but she is my best friend right now like it or not, your not here and you going in an opposite direction and like you said in your thing you need someone right now and so do I, its not just you gonig through hard times everyone does, If you still want to be friends then cool if not I am sorry to hear that but I wish that things get better for you and I hope only the best, but I hope you don't think I am not trying its just the way things are right now...I truely am sorry, doesnt matter if you believe me or not.

---My Message---

Well that was somthing really hard to write to someone that you shared so much with over a few years, but I don't know what else to do honestly, life is going so well but yet it is so royally messed up.  O well I guess I am pretty much going for a new start this year, new work, new school, new friends, new house, new town, I dunno what else I could possibly change, my hair, my clothes??? done already...o well I suppose its for the best.  Hopefully things go smoother and get better this year, if not I don't know what I am going to do.  But I know that Stace is still gunna be there for me, she is not that ditching for drugs type, I am trying to stay away from those ones this time, as mean as is sounds maybe it was draging me down I don't know.  Though I do dearly miss the old crazy times maybe its time to grow up...not all the way mind you, but think for a change and not making stupid decisions that never work out in the end.  Well this was a weekend of screaming and crying I must say but I am over it as always right...mom yelled, dad yelled, ""I get the point"", its over, now what do I actually try to conform to the way that they want me to be or do I spring in the total opposite direction cause its what I want??  Well there is a good question, one which church is hanging by a thread, I don't get it, don't get it at all.  What are friends really anyways, I don't even know if I know truely myself really, but that just waiting for me to find out I suppose.  By the way if *you* read this, you should know that I miss *you* alot and I am very sure that you know who you are *HugGsS n KisSeS* I think I made a bad decision but I dunno what I can do about it cause I can't see how I can put myself through all this and not have it work out and if it didn't then I don't know what I would do.  O well thats for me to find out.  Life is so twisted.

"event","I suppose that changing schools won't be that bad I mean I get to start all over right, not that I am complaining about what I have right now cause I have a bunch of awesome friends.  So hopefully I will just be gaining friends and not losing them!  But i can for sure see how its going to be way easier going to school in Kingsville if i live right beside it and now that I work right there and stuff it will be easy...and actually for once I am not afraid of changing usually I would be but for some strange reason this time is different so thats good @ least.  I am gunna totally miss stacey so much, yeah I am retarded I know but like she is my best friend, the ONLY persont that I tell everything no matter what, she has helped me through so much and I don't know how well thats gunna hold out, but I lost one best friend I don't want to lose another.  I miss my dad so much I wish that he would come home soon, but i know that he can't I think that this is going to be the hardest year yet, why I don't know I just have one of those feelings and they are usually right...so thats not somthing I am looking forward to.  Hockey is looking fine as of right now as long as they get everything organized I don't care as long as I get to play.  I haven't really figured my mom out yet, somtimes she rips into me about little things just because she can and other times I feel bad cause I know that she has no one to talk to.  And I find it very odd for somone that finds it so easy to take charge of people that she takes the back seat at her work and lets people push her around, even though she is the boss, that just blows my mind.  When I went in there today she lets all the people below her tell her what to do and treat her like crap I don't get it @ all, maybe I am missing somthing, but I realy don't think so. Whatever I am just going to do as much as I can that she tells me to and other then that stay out of her way and just do my thing, it works much better that way.  Overall life as gotten alot better, me getting along better with my brothers, my mom, and dad.  For some random reason and I would like to know why all the guys like me, I find it very strange, and love how the guys that I liked like 3 years ago like me now, what did I do like honestly...its strange!  Whatever lol I will just go with it for now lol...the more friends the better.   Haha omg I am sooo looking forward to tomorrow, I haven't been shopping with as much money to spend as I want on whatever I want in forever its gonig to be crazy, but hey its cool lol! And then a movie and a whole day with my best friend omg its gunna be bomb!!! Even if Kokes and Fenos don't end up coming over, who cares about them lol! Wow I cannot stop laughing about that phone call it was way to funny!  Damnnn man the dentist sucks I HATE HIM lol not really it just hurt really really bad omg I must have looked retarded when I screamed but I don't care it realyl really hurt!! And I love how he said it wouldn't and now I like can't eat *sighs*

"event","Okay...so I guess this is how it goes right...I try hard to do everything thats asked of me by my parents and actually did a half decent job this time i heard...things where actually good for once!  Mom was happy, dad was happy, friends were happy, you know generally good, but no that was way to good to be true, that lasted a little short of a month and then everything goes back to the old way of life.  So I say somthing that doesn't fall in line with the ""My mother calls the so called perfect way of life"" and then there sparks the 3 hour long fight about somthing that will never be resolved in the first place.  Not only do I fight with her but I fight constantly with myself, about whats rigth and whats wrong and what do I do about this and that, and yet I still haven't fully decided.  I'm not into my mother religion, is that so wrong?  I don't see why I don't have the choice, it's my life and when I grow up I am going to have the choice for myself not her, whatever I guess thats what she sees as the ""right"" thing to do, if there really is such a thing.  I don't even know where I stand with my dad anymore things have changed, big time and there is nothing I can do about it...I am hoping that things will get better once I am into the new house and in school, but I know that this year will be a big challenge.  Work is actually going well I am trying really hard to have at least that go right for me, attitude is everything @ that job and having a good one is the only way to get anywhere!  As far as my ""love life"" or anything near that, omg don't wanna go there it just so scrambled as of right now all I can say is 
-?-wish I knew who he was- 
-B-missing like crazie- 
-M-need to make a quick decision- 
-D-feel so bad, but I can't change a heart- 
-R-university- 
-M-user-  
That will make sense to very few, but only that few need to know for now anyways!  I will be bavk to vent some more tomorrow you can bet.

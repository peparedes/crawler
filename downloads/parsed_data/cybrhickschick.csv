"event","Not much has happened since I last wrote. I think I lead a pretty boring life actually. I didn't do anything on Saturday - not really. We did get up and go to garage sales. Steve got a papasan (sp?) chair for the garage. He loves those chairs. I hate them. We kind of have the garage set up w/ a rocker, the papasan chair, 2 of my van seats propped up and a patio chair. We have a TV out there. Eventually we plan to get a storage shed for the lawn stuff and other junk stuff. And rearrange the garage to make it more of a play area. Great for the when the kids are outside playing - I can be in the garage - watch some TV, read a book, stuff like that. But still be accessible. Great w/ Grace still being too young to go off by herself but being a bit more independent too. Anyway, the chair is a pain in the butt! He's actually got it set up close to the laundry are - so it's become more of a big laundry basket! lol! We came home and he snoozed a bit while I played on the computer. I eventually started straightening the house - and later he worked on the garage. Then I went out and cleaned out my van - a much needed task. I vacuumed it also and used armor all type stuff. And window cleaner! yes! I was so proud of my clean van! Later than evening we went out to eat and then to Walmart. On the way we ran thru a carwash! So now it was clean outside and in. Pretty cool. We watched Notting Hill that evening. It was a good movie - not a great one. I think I expected more out of Julia Roberts. Not sure what, but more. Still a romantic comedy. We also have Waterworld to watch and Arlington Road. Steve's watched Arlington Road - said it's about terrorists - he said a great movie just not for this current time line. Not w/ the current events anyway. I want to see Waterworld - but it's just so long! We'll need to watch it in parts I suppose. 

Sunday was pretty nice - the kids were decent. The boys behaved anyway. Grace was a pill - as usual. Sometimes I envy the other churches that have children's church and nursery the whole time. But I also like the time together as a family - even if the kids are bored and Grace is a toot. I did pretty well socially - talked w/ people. I felt like I had a panic attack the whole time - racing heart that wasn't really racing, short of breath, lightheaded, upset stomach - but I persevered. I spoke w/ the Relief Society president about my visiting teaching. Trying to get released. She said once you are called - you don't get released! lol! She said you just choose to do ir or not. She advised me to just mail out the message this month - to all my people - and to call my partner and let her know that I wuold just be sending out the message instead of visiting. In the meantime she would try to find me a more take charge partner. One that would motivate me - get me excited about VT but also be a leader and do a lot of the contact work in the beginning. She was very sympathetic. It made me feel better. Even though I cried when I talked w/ her. She told me not to worry about it. I hate it though - not having a partner. I hate not being a faithful VT either - like I'm failing people that might need me! I loved my VT! They have really been a source of strength for me in the past. Anyway, I'll hang in there. I had a good night that evening too. Don't remember anything in particular - but it was nice. 

Monday I cleaned my house! Yea! I also met w/ devin's teacher for parent/teacher conference. That went well. I was pleased anyway. He is doing very well in school - only occasional problems w/ his attitude. He gets frustrated w/ the other kids when they poke fun or do something he deems as unfair - like cutting in line or taking something from someone else. He's big on fairness I think. I got to speak w/ the Search teacher and she is really impressed w/ him! Says he's a great creative thinker - gets the more traditional thinkers to see outside the box so to speak. They were happy w/ what I've said I'm doing at home w/ him: the Magic Treehouse books I've gotten for him for Christmas, the Carmen Sandiego games we've gotten for geography, letting him work on his own w/ games like Payday (being the banker and loan officer and figuring the math himself) - stuff like that. If I cooked more - I'd get him in the kitchen w/ me to measure. I've heard that is great for math. Then for physical - he does karate; arts he does piano lessons; and he's also in scouts. It made me feel good. I still have a long way to go though. I need to work on Tony too. At least he participates in the stuff at home - like playing where in the usa is carmen sandiego. But he doesn't read yet and I don't know how to teach him. I'll be able to do more once he knows how to read. And he'll partcipate more in sports once he turns 6 next month. He'll start karate in either December or January - whenever the next session starts. Then next summer/fall he'll start soccer. He'll start piano at the earliest at 7 - once he's reading good. Anyway, it was a good meeting w/ Devin's teacher. I did meet w/ the school counselor - to have her start seeing him also. I want to take advantage of all the resources available. Then I went to the cafeteria to see Tony - he was at lunch by that point. It was a nice surprise for him. I didn't stay b/c he was already seated and there weren't any seats available. So Grace and I came home and I started cleaning. I got most of the house clean. My bedroom is awful! And the laundry may be clean, but it's not folded - so it's piling up. I'm so bad at that! That's my goal for tomorrow - before 1PM when the missionaries will be here. Yikes! I felt good on Monday. I got to visit w/ Dad also and Rosella and Wayne (dad's cousins). They are so fun and nice! I wish I had known them earlier in life. Wayne went to see a chiropractor while down here and they just called around. I wish I had known - been able to save them the time. Turned out alright though b/c they picked my chiro anyway! lol! And they like him! They go back home on Thursday. I even made dinner when I got home! grace wasn't feeling well and we both were in bed by 9PM! Can you believe that?! 

We also both were up by 7 this AM. Got the boys up; made breakfast and their lunches. They usually get school lunches but both of them wanted to take it today. We were running late too - so it was rush rush. I was able to read a short story out of the Book of Mormon Stories that I'm reading to them. That's our AM ""scripture study"" - I think more on their level. Plus it helps me I think w/ my studies. We were able to say a quick AM prayer and out the door they went just as the bus was getting the kids. They were able to run all the way while the bus waited. Ever since we've started the reading and prayer - they have yet to miss the bus! It's been great! I was tired though and wanted to go back to bed. Grace didn't. But by 10 she was asleep - so we got a quick nap - well actually about an hour. Then up and getting ready for counseling. My dad's wife babysat on short notice. So I got another visit w/ Rosella and Wayne. Went to my counselor and stopped at Old Navy on the way home - trying to find another pair of sunglasses for Grace. The boys lost hers. They were out but was having a great sale. I got Steve 5 shirts for under $20! He was impressed. I lost track of time though and rushed home. Trying to get here by 3:20 - when the boys got off the bus. Drove the bus route - checking for the bus - thinking if I saw it then I was late. Never saw it. But the boys had climbed in a window b/c I wasn't home! The bus had to have been super early! Very frustrating. Anyway, they were safe and off we went to Cheryl's to get Grace. Visited a bit more w/ everyone. Then off we came home. Did nothing at home b/c I have struggled w/ either a mild migraine or the pressure of a sinus headache. Not sure. But it hurts and makes doing things difficult. We did play a game tonight w/ the boys. And my grandparents called. I don't talk to them as much as I'd like - so it's always a long wonderful conversation. I really miss them. They are in poor health and I probably won't see them again before they die. That makes me sad. Best news today was that I finished 2nd Nephi! yea! I've never done that! I estimate by the end of the week I will be in Mosiah? Or thereabouts. There are several books that are only one chapter. It'll take a couple days to finish Jacob. Anyway, I'm proud that I'm sticking with it. Even last night - not feeling well. I still read one chapter. I just didn't feel right about not reading at all. 

My counseling visit - went pretty well. She's waiting on a call from a stake president somewhere that's a shrink. I told her about the research clinic - who I haven't heard from yet. She was excited about that and told me to keep pursuing that as well. I told her all the Becca shared w/ me and she was impressed - said it sounded like a really good seminar. We talked about my anger issues - w/ the kids and stuff. How to handle things - we're going to try deep breathing techniques next time. She says it's impossible to be angry and relaxed at the same time. She also said a way to tell if physical punishment is a good idea or not (based on severity I guess) is to tell whether you are angry or not. If you aren't angry - then physical punishment will be for the benefit of the child (my words not hers) vs. just getting anger out on a child's rear. Made lots of sense - but also something I was aware of. We did discuss my family. She agreed w/ me - as far as not living in the past. She says I'm not. I'm realizing certain issues are tied to the past - but I'm not living in the past. I am trying to move forward. She doesn't think having sessions w/ Melissa are a good idea b/c these are my sessions - and not all about her. Like today was a lot about other issues in my life. Plus - my point of view - the church picks up half the tab. Not fair for the church to pay for something that isn't really related to the reasons I'm in therapy in the first place. Mom had suggested counseling for all of us - but one that doesn't know any of us. I agree that's probably a good idea - but who's going to pick up that tab. Not me, that's for sure. Not w/ all the expenses I have lately. Anyway, she says I'm doing good. She agrees - or sees my point anyway - about the hurt I experienced w/ my mom expressing her ""concern"" to my sister about the possibility of cycling and not being on meds. The meds thing was for several reasons - main one being lack of funds and insurance. Another one was b/c of the issues w/ SSRIs - and things I've read. Things I thought mom agreed w/ being a holistic type person herself. The therapist herself agreed that I'm not being careless by not being on meds - I'm not doing something stupid. It was a trial run - and it's not going very well. But it was me trying to take responsibility for myself. And the comments from her about me cycling and from Melissa about my ""mood swings"" and ""rages"" (which she herself has also) - the reason I felt hurt was b/c I feel like I'm not allowed to express any other emotion than happy go lucky. Not sadness or anger or madness or exuberance. If I do - then it must be a mood swing. And heaven forbid I go thru a point of being happy about something and then angry in the same day - then I must be cycling - or I guess again, the mood swings. Whatever. It puts blame on my disorder, blame that I myself am not putting! I take responsibility for my feelings - if I'm wrong to be angry - I'm wrong. But I'm not saying, ""oh, I must be cycling; my bipolar is controlling my life"" - or whatever. If I'm not putting the blame on it - why shoudl they. The counselor pointed out that underneath what I'm also saying is - if they put the blame on the bipolar - they are in effect invalidating my feelings. Like they don't matter. It's just the bipolar and my feelings aren't real or justified. I also feel like maybe they should put themselves in my shoes and be brutally honest w/ themselves - how would they react if the situations were completely reversed? Would they also be hurt and/or angry? Sure they would! So how is I'm cycling or raging or having mood swings? I'm in counseling to take control and to change my behavior patterns - to learn how to have control and keep control of my life. not let some stupid disorder control me. So don't blame the disorder. 

I don't know - there are times when I do mention - on up days - that I must be manic. I have absolutely no idea how to control that. But those days - unless medicated - are few and far between. And the least of my worries. For one - they feel great! lol! But also - depression is where I get the most sensitive to changes in moods - depressed, sad, irritated, frustrated, hurt, etc. I'm just generally happy while manic. Sometimes irritated, but mostly happy. And talkative! lol! Anyway, I'm in therapy to deal w/ this. I have learned thru all of this that I cannot speak of my mental issues w/ my family b/c they fling it back at me. 

Well, that's been my few days. Basically uneventful. Oh, mom is sending Melissa my emails to her - so Melissa can read them and go over them and then email me or whatever. she goofed and sent one of mine (of the 2 I sent her) back to me instead of to Melissa. I honestly can't wait to hear what Melissa has to say - whether she ""supports"" me like she says she will or whether she attacks me again. We'll see tomorrow I suppose. Whatever - I've already decided I am incapable of having an honest relationship w/ mom or Melissa - ever. Dad maybe - but he still talks to mom at times about us. So maybe not even him. I was proud of myself - dad tried to gossip about Melissa and I gave my opinion on her moving in w/ her guy and getting married - nothing I haven't said to Melissa already. Then I left it at that. When I felt it starting to turn to gossip - I stopped. Today too w/ Cheryl - she tried to talk about the marraige thing. Did not participate in gossip. Felt good about that. But we'll see what tomorrow turns up. My therapist agrees w/ me also - that since I do not plan to be close w/ Melissa - that a face to face meeting to get this all out of the way - it would not be productive. It would end up w/ hurt feelings and more hoopla - and not condusive at all to a healthy relationship - since I do not foresee us having a healthy relationship anyway. 

Gotta go to bed. I think Grace may actually be asleep and maybe Steve and I get FINALLY get some action! heehee!"

"event","Oh my gosh! I hate my computer! I had an entry all typed out when my computer froze! Lost it all! Let me see if I can remember what I wrote.

Not much has happened this week - maybe it has; depends on how you look at it. My sister and I may or may not be making progress. We can't read each others emails very well - always reading emotions into them that aren't there. She wants to sit down and do this face to face. I'm wondering at the point of it. We dont' see eye to eye. She wants to put everything behind her and go on about life. I don't see it that way. If she wants an honest relationship w/ me - we need to talk about things. But then she makes it out like I'm living in the past and need to just get over things. Makes it all about me. I think she just doens't want to see the truth about herself. She talks about me being whiny and raging and having mood swings - things she can't handle. About me making this all about me. When I think she needs to just look in the mirror. B/c I see the same things in her. She's getting married now. In January - but I'm not supposed to tell anyone. They'll actually have the ""ceremony"" next year in August. His first marraige - so she's respecting his rights to keep it private. Oops! I wasn't supposed to tell! Oh well. She said herself, as have I, no one in this family can keep a secret. She keeps asking to keep my boys overnight when she moves in w/ this guy. Even once they are married - proving it to me on a certificate if that's what it takes. I just don't know. Definitely not while they aren't married - I'm tired of having to explain to my kids why these guys keep coming and going in her life! Devin is scared now that me and steve will get divorced! I actually think this marraige - if it makes it that far - will make it. For about 5 years maybe. Then she'll get tired of being a mommy and wifey - tired of being tied down to one person. She didn't meet him at the club or out drinking - so she'll most likely get bored w/ him. Then she'll hook up w/ some single friends again and start over. Only this time she'll be pushing 40 (well, 1/2 way thru 30). Probably sagging more than now - and not just her boobs. Wrinkles b/c she tans so much. I'm sure she won't look her best. And how many almost 40 yr olds are out there partying all night and sleeping around? Probably a lot, actually, but not exactly good examples. Anyway, I expect her to ""show"" us for awhile that she can be a good mommy (she's quitting her job for at least a couple months to stay w/ the kids - maybe even go back to college) and wife - be stable and mature. Try to prove to us she can change. Whatever. Don't see it lasting. Not at least until her kids are grown and she no longer has anyone. Then she'll at least pick someone to latch onto - so she's not alone. Gee - I don't paint a good picture of her, do I?

Mom and I - hmm, not really sure what to do there. I've at least emailed her to let her know what I think and why I was hurt. She emailed back her thoughts and feelings. She's now hurt - to be expected. Of course she changes things - or adds things. Things I don't remember from my youth - could just be skewed from my own memory. Or could be her changing or adding things to fit her story. She denies most of the abuse too, yet me and my sister remember it. I really love her - want a relationship w/ her. But I just don't think I can trust her. Not w/ the kids - totally. Not w/ me. Or my emotions or feelings or thoughts. I've laid the law on gossip. I won't participate or tolerate. She did say something in the email that totally ticked me off. She said she was concerned, and expressed that concern to my sister, that I might be cycling. That she was concerned that I was off my meds. This is from the homeopathic queen! She claims to know the dangers of the SSRI drugs -etc. Yet she's concerned I'm off meds?! It would make more sense for her to be concerned if I was ON meds! But of course, once I start meds again - if I have a reaction or get worse or whatever, of course she'll have seen that coming or been worried about that. She always plays the ""I saw that coming"" part. Like w/ Melissa and her beaus - mom always sees the problems before anyone else. Anyway, back to the comment. It makes me mad b/c I've shared my mental health issues w/ her - w/ everyone actually. ANd I feel she used it as a weapon - back to hurt me or something. Like a person that's bipolar can't have ups and downs! Liek I'm supposed to be happy all the time - if I'm not - then I must be cycling or raging or having mood swings. It explains my sister's comments about me - since they apparently discussed it. Yet people don't come to me w/ their concerns. I guess they are afriad I'll flip out and kill them or something. Like my husband -I've asked Steve many times - to be my monitor. If I seem to be losing it more often - he needs to not be afraid to let me know. I do not want to slip to uncontrollable - I want that least of all! More than anyone - I want to be healthy; somewhat normal. I can't stand it if I'm upset for someone to say ""are you taking your meds?"" ""are you cycling?"" ""I can't handle your mood swings""! Whatever! Get a grip lady!

Good news is that Becca emailed me and she attended a seminar. There is a research clinic down in her town - they are doing studies right now on depression, anxiety and bipolar. She thinks it's current meds - not new ones. She says they are able to pinpoint better what neurotransmitter is messing up or missing. And able to prescribe drugs to work better. I've asked her for the info on it. Also she said the doc showed CAT scans on the brains of chronically depressed people and how they differ from normal brains. Signs of brain damage - especially, I think she said, in the memory centers. Which actually makes sense b/c my memory isn't the best lately - short term mostly. I can't function well under stress - at recalling info. I used to thrive under pressure. I can't read or listen or watch something complicated w/o getting lost or confused or just disorientated. Usually my mind just drifts off. Reading the scriptures really really stresses me out b/c they can be difficult to understand. Anyway, I've been depressed for years - as early as preteens. Possibly earlier. I wonder what my brain looks like. Maybe I better not wonder! lol!

More good news is I've been praying every single night now - almost 2 weeks. I've read my scriptures for a week now - every night. Well, except one. I was sick and took some tylenol PM and fell asleep. I'm well into 2nd Nephi - well not well into it. Chapter 10 I think is where I stopped. But 10 -24 seem like short chapters. I can probably knock those out tomorrow. The only reason I quit is b/c my mind starts to wander and I end up having to read over and over. When that happens, I need to stop. I'm not bored though. I've also - since MOnday morning - read to the boys while they ate breakfast. Not out of the scriputres, but one of their level scripture books - the Beginner Reader or something like that. We're into Enos or something like that. At first it was keepign up w/ me. Now it's ahead! I feel the need to rush! Also before they walk out the door - we kneel and say a family prayer - well just the boys and me. I lead. I've noticed their evening prayers are improving too. Anyway, the days have improved - only today did I get a temper tantrum out of Tony. And I think that was because he was tired. Anyway, I didn't handle it well. But in the end - he was okay. Thank goodness. I have faith the Lord is with me - even when I stumble. I am trying every day - to make my life better so the boys lives will be better. I can tell a difference in my attitude b/c I'm so much more patient w/ Gracie that I was w/ the boys at her age. She is a trying little personality too! She potty training now. Her decision, not mine! not really looking forward to it but that's life I guess. We all grow up. She actually peed in the potty tonight! yea! Oh, my counselor said something on Tuesday that I thought was interesting. She said she sees me in the eye of the storm so to speak. I'm past so much garbage and now am in the calm. A place where I can look around and see all the garbage I've been thru as well as stuff I haven't yet. A place to reflect and plan. B/c I know that if I'm to make it better for myself, I have to make it thru the rest of the storm to get past it. So that's good to know. I'm halfway there. I hope so. 

Gotta go to bed now. I'm exhausted! Lots to do tomorrow. I really really really need to vacuum, sweep and mop and do laundry. I would like to finish 2nd Nephi tomorrow totally too. Steve needs to mow and finish cleaning the garage. I've bought shelves to put food storage and emergency essentials on too - so he needs to put those together and then screw them to the walls in the garage so they don't fall over. Then maybe Monday I'll feel brave enough to actually venture to Sam's and go shopping! I have money to blow! WooHoo!!!"

"event","Church went really well today! Steve didn't go - he was sick and running a fever. I took my time getting ready and the kids ready but we still weren' very late. Got there just as the bread was being passed. We stayed in the foyer the whole time - Grace was very ornery! Very cranky and just a pistol. Oh well, we made. The speakers all were on time - no one was long winded. Which was really amazing b/c one guy that spoke is known for speaking very very slowly and taking forever! So Sacrament meeting was done early! I got Grace to nursery and she threw a fit - but it didn't last long and she stayed the whole time. I really wanted to go to the Gospel Doctrine class, but it's so big and my anxiety prevented me from just going in and sitting down. But I did go into the Essentials class and even sat next to someone and started a conversation - even participated in the lesson! It was a good day! I read some after opening exercises in YW - I went to the foyer to read, but then a couple women came and sat and we all talked. After church I met w/ the bishop and he is going to check about when I can start temple prep classes! yes! I'm so excited about this! I will most likely have my endowments by the end of the year! I came home and Steve was still sick - but instead of feeling resentful of him, I tended to him and the kids. I feel a bit proud of myself for serving willingly instead of griping or feeling resentment. I tend to be selfish and I was tired and have had a headache all day. Usually I want to lie down and don't want to take care of someone else. And Steve is usually so giving and accomodating - always giving up his time to take care of me or the kids so I can get a break. So it was nice to give back. I started reading the Book of Mormon last night - I've been reading the Bible this last week - just pieces here and there, not really knowing where to start - besides the beginning. But I opened the BofM and began there. I've never made it out of 2nd Nephi. I'm already thru Chapter 11 of 1st Nephi and plan to finish tomorrow! So by the end of the week - I will most definitely be out of 2nd Nephi! I plan to read every day - morning and night! I plan to try to spend less time on the computer doing basically nothign and more time reading. It feels good. I really feel the Lord answered my prayer about anxiety at church - and I was able to ahve a good meeting and not feel stressed at all! The Bishop and I had a good talk too - about my counseling and medication. He is concerned about the meds - he's heard it can keep one from feeling the Spirit. That was a big issue w/ me - and my counselor had originally said that was a classic excuse of bipolars to avoid medications. But I told him that I've prayed about it. And while it isn't the ideal situation in my book - it is the solution that is needed. And while I do worry about feeling the Spirit - I am more concerned for my family if I don't return to meds. I'm becoming a social recluse and it's beginning to hurt my kids. And I really don't want that. I told him that the Lord will hold my hand, and while there may be times when I dont' feel the Spirit - it will be there. I feel good about this decision. I'm glad too. But it really made me feel good that the Bishop was concerned and not just pushing the meds! I thought that was awesome. He recommended a priesthood blessing - so I need to call my home teacher and see if I can get one. 
I've been emailed a better list for food and supply storage. I think it will fit our family better. As much as I want to improve our diet and eat less junk - I think we may be out of time for me to learn. So I'll stick w/ the stuff we do eat - w/ some healthy stuff thrown in. It's just a more practical list. Like what am I going to do w/ 1000 pounds of wheat??? I don't have a clue what to do w/ it! But boxes of mac and cheese - now THAT I know what to do with! haha! Anyway, I'm really hyped about it! But I'm concerned about how much time I have! We have a bit of money in savings and I could get quite a bit of food storage and supplies - a rather large portion. But I don't know if I should clean out our savings or not. He does get paid on the 1st and I'll have almost $500 after bills - and I may just take all of that and leave the savings alone for right now. Steve did mention getting a storage shed for our lawn equipment and getting it out of the garage. That would free up some space too in the garage! So I'm thinking lots of shelves in the garage - for storage of supplies that aren't bothered by the heat or cold. I need to clean out our closet and Gracie's again - make more room. I may whittle down what I have on my side of the closet and move Grace's stuff into our closet - so I can use hers for storage for the time being. I'm thinking a shelving unit also for our bathroom. Not pretty - but no one uses our bathroom anyway. Anyway, I'm really hyped about stocking up. Just not really sure where to start. There are so many things we need! Food sure - but also the supplies. And those may not be around or become hard to get. It's just hard trying to figure out what those might be. 
Anyway, Devin starts piano lessons on Thursday. That's exciting! It's $7 a lesson plus books. She wants to get 3 books to start and they are around $6 ea - but that's not an every lesson thing. So he now has karate on Mondays, w/ scouts on Wednesdays and now piano lessons on Thursdays! 
Well, I'd better get to bed. I still need to say my prayers. I also think Steve called me a minute ago but I'm not sure b/c I didnt' hear him call again."

"event","Hmm, not much has happened. I don't remember where I left off. I don't remember if I mentioned 9-11-01. Such a bizarre, horrible, scary day. What horror to look at those buildings - to see the news show over and over the plane crashing into one of them - to see the people jumping! Then the buildings crashing. The country - world has pulled together. We're very patriotic right now. Lots of gatherings and displays of memories, patriotism, thanks. It makes me proud to be an American.

Of course another thing that makes me proud is that I can look at the president and see that he is doing lots to pull us together - to make us feel safer - to be prayerful and mindful of us. And I can wonder what his hidden agenda is. Like this new Homeland Security business. Of course the country is thrilled! We're getting more protection! We're willing to give up some of our freedoms so we can be safe! Yes! Yes! NO WAY! This program was announced 9 months ago! This is a program to take away our freedoms! It's a program to make us a police state! This is a program to destroy the constitution of the United States - the constitution our founding fathers fought for! Yet, we're all scared and afraid that without this protection - the horror will happen again! So what to do, what to do? 

I've been praying every evening. And I've been reading my scriptures. I hope to begin morning prayers and morning study also. But I have to do a little at a time or I overwhelm myself and never develop a habit. I'm looking at our food storage. And it sucks! We'd be lucky to last a month. So I'm trying to find ways to quickly build it - at least a years worth. Cheaply. Quickly. Where to store it? I've thought of Grace's room - not like she sleeps in there. Steve's worried about weight - too much weight he says will crack the foundation. We'll work it out - I guess - b/c I'm getting the food anyway. I'm just torn at the moment between buying in bulk like 50# bags of stuff or 10# cans. The cans will last longer and store better - but the bags are cheaper. I'll really have to see. I'm concerned about Steve though. I feel he's not on board - spiritually as well as temporaly. He doesn't see the big picture w/ the food storage. He doesn't see the need for the spiritual mumbo jumbo. He believes in God and the Bible - but he doesn't practice it. He's really into worldly things. I feel us growing apart some days.

Like this weekend. He called me early in the week to ask me out on a date. I was excited! We haven't been out in awhile and I was feeling distant from him. Well Friday night came - night of the date. ANd he was busy cleaning up his truck. He's got to give it to another coworker so he can get a new one. He said Saturday. I waited all day for him. Of course we did absolutely nothing! He said he couldn't find a babysitter. Fine - but he didn't tell me! I had to ask what happened to our date. This was at 9:30PM! He didn't see the big deal until I told him it hurt me! Made me feel unimportant. Now he's apologetic. Maybe next weekend. We really need to connect! All this stuff going on - I feel very distant from him. 

Oh well, off to bed. I'm the only one still up - I can't believe it! Grace is asleep - been there for over an hour! What am I still doing up? Got church tomorrow - hoping it will be a good day. I'm already dreading it though - I've ""started"" so I'm expecting hormones to be raging! lol! HOpefully Steve will go w/ me - I really need him to sit w/ me, help w/ the kids, stay for sunday school. We'll see."

"event","Wow - it's been ages. I sit at the computer most days and just don't know what to write - or want to take the time to do it. So much has happened, it's hard to know where to begin. 

First, there was my sister's party - I think I've written since then. My sister and I were just getting past the party fight - when CPS called her and met w/ her. She was convinced I called and refused to talk to me -  but willingly talked about me to everyone else. It was a huge mess! Well, we're finally getting past that - she says she still doesn't know who called, but she forgives them. The biggest problem I had though - and still do - is my mom. For years my mom has said that we all need to stand together and confront Melissa - for using us, etc. And when it came time to admit what we've thought - I stood alone. I don't know how many times I was told by others that mom believed that I didn't call CPS - she was defending me! Yet, who was it getting attacked for badmouthing my sister? Who was it that took all the anger? I did! Mom is now denying things that she said - such as her agreeing the CPS was probably warranted; or that it would hopefully be a wakeup call for her if someone called. Now she tells dad that whoever did it is dispicable and a low life. I believe she is doing what she always does - and either denies doing anything (sudden amnesia I guess) or changes things so she looks better. She talks a good talk when she's mad at someone - but when it comes down to it - she can't handle the confrontation. She's also terrified my sister will take the kids! So of course she'll do whatever to keep that from happening. I also believe - which my counselor pointed out when I was talking about my youth w/ my sister and I now fully believe! - that mom tries to play us against each other! Mom and I were just talking about our fear that Melissa would try to play me and Mom against each other - and the whole time i believe mom does it to me and Melissa! Instead of being a mom and letting me and Melissa duke it out or work it out - she butts in and usually eggs it on! At the party - she was the first one griping! She immediately started in badmouthing her w/ Renee and Brandy - two of Melissa's friends. I didn't participate hardly at all til Michael got there - then of course I let loose. And that was wrong. But at least I can admit what I've done and get over it. At least my conscience is clear. Other times mom could have taken sides - for example: when I was growing up. Many times my sister beat the crap out of me! She was jealous of me from day one. Well, I rarely hit her back and when I did - I 'pulled' my punches b/c I didn't want to hurt her. When I was 15, I got fed up and decked her in the face. She called mom - who was 2 hours away taking care of her ailing father - and tattled that I broke her nose (never even bruised or bled). Mom griped me out! Until Melissa was out of earshot - then i got a pat on the back. All those years, mom could have stopped Melissa from beating me up - but she didn't. At that time, she could have told Melissa that she deserved it! Or at least asked her what she did to cause me to do that - since I was never violent! All thru our youth, mom would gripe or make fun of Melissa to me - and vice versa! it would cause anger and hurt feelings. And instead of talking it out - to clear things up - we would end up fighting. This time - she could have said - well, I said those things too. So what? You are a slut; it was awful to invite all your ex's to your party and then hang on them! you do treat your kids like crap a lot. I agree w/ Melanie and have said the same things as her! but did she? NO! Dad is angry too b/c she is denying some of the things she said to him. I really feel cheated b/c I thought she had changed. I thought we were getting closer. I felt like I could really count on her for anything. Not anymore. So I don't trust her. There have been times when we've talked about the church and the last days. We've talked about when the Prophet calls us to New Jerusalem - and we'd go. We talked about Melissa and mom said she'd kidnap the kids! In '97, when Steve left me b/c I was mentally out of control - he took the kids. I was devastated! I was also desperate and miserable, etc! And she wanted to get him to go over there - take the kids there so I could have a ""supervised"" visit - and then she'd help me take the kids and run! Dad was my voice of reason then. Told me Steve's ""demands"" were reasonable and I'd be a fool not to do them - and if I didn't, he wouldn't help me. All Steve really wanted was for me to get help. Which I did. And it was the best thing he could have done for me. I really am beginning to wonder if mom really loves us - or just the gkids. I mean, they adore her! They don't see her faults - and we do. We remember the abuse (which she denies most of). But they love her unconditionally - and I think she feeds off of that. If I were to die - and Steve was left w/ the kids - I'm sure she would sue for custody. She told me once when I was dating my exboyfriend - that if I was a slob when I had kids (I really was a slob before I had kids) - then she'd get the kids taken from me. She also used to tell me when I was in high school - that if I ever got pregnant, she wouldn't be mad. She'd even take the kid to raise so I could keep my youth and not be tied down. This was when she should have been telling me that I should not have sex! I could go on and on - but I really am beginning to wonder what I can trust about her. I love her and forgive her for the abuse as a child - most of it. Some of it I'm just now realizing she did. Maybe not abuse - but pitting me and my sister against each other - that bites. We probably could have been close sisters. Not now. 

Anyway, that's all I'm going to get into tonight. I didn't realize I'd have so much to say. I'll try to post more tomorrow. I have nothing going on, except counseling w/ Devin's counselor - which I think I will pass on. I just don't ""click"" w/ her - bad vibes or something. Plus she really thinks Devin is done w/ his counseling. And I have my own counselor - who I ""click"" w/ very nicely. I had a great session yesterday. Oh, I'm also going to go back on meds. That sucks and it doesn't. I mean - it's a way for me to hopefully get my sanity back; but it sucks b/c I really don't trust the meds from everything I've read. I will just have to pray they work. Maybe I'll even get a blessing. We'll see. That's it for now."

"event","It's Monday - and what a day it's been. I've actually accomplished very little! lol! I did get my junk drawer and utensil drawers in the kitchen cleaned out. I plan to try to get my cabinets cleaned out either tonight or tomorrow. I need some organization - badly! Anyone know how to organize and want to come to my house to help - for free?? lol! I spent Saturday baking 5 different kinds of cookies and preparing for the party. I had to go get the tables myself - they didn't fit in the back - since i had 3 kids; but I made it home. Luckily I only lived 1/2 mile from the party store. I went to mom's to decorate. The mosquitos were terrible! We all got eaten up! I did get most of the house decorated and mom got lots of the cooking done. So home we went. When we got home, I made everyone take 2 garlic pills each - for the mosquitos. Devin chewed one of his and Grace chewed both of hers! Gross! the house reeked from it! I made the signs - on Publisher; glued them to neon posterboard and then laminated them. They looked really good! I was proud of myself! lol! Steve had to go to his mom's to help her on her car. Sunday came and I took the boys to Melissa's - she was going to watch them while I got the party stuff ready. I loaded the van and headed to mom's. The weather was nasty and it ended up pouring down rain. Luckily that stopped most people from coming. I think a total of 27 people were there - but 5 of them weren't invited - she called them in the afternoon and asked them to come. She drank all day and acted the slut part real well. Her ""ex"" Michael showed up - w/ a sexy friend of his. Not a girlfriend, just a friend. She was HOT! (Women can say that about each other - lol) We all wanted to kill her until we found out she'd never had any kids - then we all were just envious - b/c none of us looked like that even before kids! lol! It was a tiresome party but nothing was really said there - except behind her back. Everyone there talked about her when she left the room. Now she's mad b/c she found out. Steve said that her party was an ""ex"" party - and he didn't know she was there when he said it. So she heard him. He also said that more people there had seen her naked than hadn't. It was true! Well, she's got her panties in a wad now and emailed me asking me if I said this or that. Well, I'm fed up so I told her what I said and why I said it. It felt good to tell her - that I cared, but that I was concerned about her lifestyle. And I thought it was ridiculous to get mad at us and her ""ex"" for still getting along. She brings these guys into our lives and then expects us to hate them or write them off when she's done using them. But these are nice guys! We still like them! I also told her that I thought it was dangerous to always bring these guys into her home - around her children. For them to wonder who this guy is in their house and in their mom's bed - and when he leaves - where did he go? It's hard on the kids to understand and it's hard on the guys that like her kids. But she just got mad and basically told me to mind my own business. Which I then told her that it's not any of my business and it is my opinion - but maybe I wouldn't have it if she wouldn't broadcast her life - and intimate details - to everyone; thus making it our business. She is currently on her way to mom's to pick up her daughter and to ""visit"". Mom and I think she is there to gripe - and I'm betting that she is mad at me and is now going to try to turn mom against me also. Problem is Mom is on my side. 
Dad's cousin - Wayne - is right now in surgery having a triple bypass. He went up there at 6AM and didn't get into surgery until 3PM - I can't imagine spending all that time waiting! How awful! But it's a very risky surgery and he wasn't looking forward to it; though he knew he needed it. That's why he's here in the first place. 
Steve had another brother die - sometime Saturday night. His kids found him Sunday morning and he was cold by then. His sister is guessing a heart attack. He was in his 40's and had a myriad of health problems. It's sad though and scary for Steve. In June of '99 his brother Ben died (drowned from fishing while drunk); 9-16-00 his dad died (he was 74); and now this. 3 deaths in 3 years. Steve is faced w/ his mortality and he's not liking it. We can't go to OH this time though - not really financial, though it is an issue. More b/c he feels his job can't really make it w/o him. Shoot - he took a week vacation and he got called every day! Also at his dad's funeral last year, the family split. My FIL was married and had 6 kids - his wife died and he later married my MIL and had 2 more kids. So Steve is the youngest of 8. Well, the 6 kids never like my MIL and felt she ruined my FIL's life. Problem was - Bob stayed w/ her for 30+ years! She may have made things hard, but it was still his decision to stay and choose to love her. Lots of things got said and lots of people got hurt and took sides. Biggest problem I have w/ Steve's family is people say one thing about someone and everyone else takes it as fact instead of staying out of it or finding out the other side. No one has any privacy. I was a lousy wife and caused Steve to have to choose between me and them - for awhile. I felt like they were being very rude and disrespectful and judgmental of me and him. And they felt the same way about me. Instead of sitting down to talk about it - they made assumptions about what I was mad about and yelled and screamed and made things miserable for Steve. For example the night we left the house to get a hotel - it was b/c they were up all hours of the night and I couldn't get Grace to sleep; the cigarette smoke was killing me and Steve and I needed to be alone; he was getting very angry at his family and I was feeling very angry at them for making my husband mad. The oldest sister got it in her head that I thought she should have banned smoking in her house - which I would never assume. In my house yes, but not in someone else's own home. Another instance was the morning Steve had left to go make arrangements at the funeral home - I was in the bedroom w/ Grace and I started crying. I felt sad about my FIL. His middle sister came in and saw me and asked if I needed to talk - I didn't want to but didn't say anything else either. So she got it in her head and the older sister's head that I was mad at Steve for leaving me there. Stupid petty stuff. Our marraige almost ended. It was scary b/c I was so close to leaving him there and driving back myself. Well, now it's been insinuated that we - Steve and I; nor his mother or youngest sister - are not welcome there for the funeral. It makes no difference - if we wanted to be there, we would be there. And we would not impose on her for a place to sleep - we would either stay w/ his grandparents *if* they offered or we would get a hotel (most likely). It was said right out that there was no room for us. The brother that died is not Steve's full brother - it's a half. They made it plain as day at his dad's funeral last year that there was significance in that half. It meant they (Steve and his sister) were worth less than the others b/c 'their"" dad was more important (it's the SAME dad). Whatever! Anyway, he's torn up about his brother dying and we can't go. We are loaning the money for my MIL to fly to OH for her to go. She will stay w/her parents while she is there. I've even thought about going w/ my MIL - just to be w/ her. And #1 the though of flying kills me (terrified) and #2 I never want to see that side of the family again. I've said my apologies to them and have yet to see the adults that supposedly exist - no apologies back. Anyway, this brother was a decent man - he tried to mend the family at his dad's funeral the year before. I will miss him. It's odd though - not making a trip to OH this year. After 2 years of going, it's just weird. 
Well, that's all I think - between the death and my sister's party - I can't remember any other news. My birthday got kind of shoved into the background. As usual."

"event","Well, it's not been much of a birthday. The kids missed the bus so I had to take them. Which meant losing my day to sleep in - cause I had to wake Grace up. She was wide awake by the time I got back. We went to walk today - finally. The air compressor in my van isn't working for some reason so I had to dig up quarters for the air machine at the gas station - the jogging stroller has inflatable tires. We went to walk. About 1/2 mile in my left hip starts hurting. It's okay - I'll make it. But on the beginning of the 2nd mile the track turns the other way and now the sun is in Gracie's eyes. She refused to wear her sunglasses and cried most of the time. So I cut out the last 1/2 mile - and actually the last couple hundred feet or so I jogged. Ooh, I do NOT run. I have injured my knees from falling - in high school on skates on the seawall in Galveston; on roller blades in a skate shop learning a new stop technique; at a volleyball game a month after the roller blade incident - leading to bursitis; etc. Now my hip is KILLING me! It hurts very very very badly. So then Grace and I go get breakfast. It's about 9AM. There is this really creepy scary guy that just stares the entire time! A couple times I looked for our waitress and saw him staring so I smiled - nothing. Just stared. Weird! Luckily he didn't leave when I did - or I wouldn't have drove home! lol! I made it to the mall today to get our pictures. The kids let me get a nap. It was a nice pretty day. 
Unfortunately Steve had to work late. Poor guy - he had a terrible day at work! Nothing went right today and he said he actually almost quit! That would TOTALLY suck! I understand where he's coming from but it's scary to think about. He's mad b/c he didn't get to be here for my birthday - but I understand. Now he has to work tomorrow too to finish the job he had today. Hopefully he will be home early enough to help me w/ the party preparations. I have to make about 5 or 6 dozen cookies tomorrow - go shopping for final supplies - go to mom's to start decorating and help her finish cleaning. Yuck. And w/ him working - I have to miss the volunteer basic training for scouts. I don't have a babysitter. 
We went to McDonald's for lunch b/c I so badly did not want to cook. But I felt bad and didn't really want to eat out either - geez! Especially w/ my 3 kids and no help on my birthday! What a nightmare that would be. 
Luckily Steve is home now - probably in bed by now. I need to get there too. I have a terrible migraine headache. Hopefully the meds will kick in soon and I can get some rest. Please!"

"event","Again, it's been a few days. I'm not sure why it's been so hard to sit and write. I can play mind numbing, boring, stupid computer games or work on the newsletter for church, or email. But the thought of writing out - even just my day - has not appealed to me at all. 

I went and saw my counselor and spent the whole session griping about my sister. And how angry she makes me. It's consumed me - keeping me awake at night; dreaming up scenarios of how I tell her off or write her out of my life. She was impressed w/ my mood chart and said since I write well - I need to write my feelings down about my sister. Like what I would say to her - the different scenarios and such. But it just never felt right. Long and drawn out - mundane. Mostly, just too close to home - writing it would make it more real maybe? I've been busy all week dealing w/ her party stuff. Went shopping for food and decorations. Took those to mom's. Made the direction signs and bought the stakes. I even made her a pretty halo - type thing instead of the typical birthday hat. It's a circle for her head of flowers w/ ribbon down the back. I think it looks neat - though I know it's not her type of thing. She'll at least wear it while we sing happy birthday. She called today several times and emailed about several things - tents for the yard; tables; etc. I flat out told her I had no more money to spend. Mom said the same thing. And it felt good to say that. She was very receptive and offered to pay for the tables and her new beau bought some tents from Academy. Not once all day did she do something ""wrong"". I waited and waited for her to do something or say something - selfish or greedy - so I could finally blow up at her or say something. But it never happened. It kind of made me mad! lol! But while I was waiting at the counselor for Devin, I was reading the Ensign (church magazine) and there was an article on gratitude. It was very good and really hit home. I think I spend most of my time griping about my life, or someone else's or things that go wrong, and I just do not take the time to be grateful - for much of anything. I've tried I think, but never made a real effort. I don't really like myself much - and I wonder if it's b/c I'm so negative - or at least part of it anyway. I really don't like my mother in law b/c she is extremely negative and pessimistic. And I'm becoming the same way. I have found that if I'm around negative people or people that gossip or judge/condemn others - I become the same way. I tend to mimic those around me. So I thought about all that went right today - or things I'm grateful for. My husband is truly awesome. He helps everyone out and rarely gripes. We see very little of each other at times b/c he's out w/ others helping. I usually get resentful of this but it really is nice to have a husband that is dependable - someone my family can turn to or others can turn to for help. He went to my mom's tonight to finish up the fort then came back home to fix the server (our UPS battery finally died and he had to bypass that). Then he left to go work on his mom's car. Now he's out trying to get his work stuff ready for tomorrow and he may not get any sleep tonight. He could have put my mom and his mom off so he could get his work stuff done and still get sleep and time w/ his family - but he didn't. B/c they needed him. My visiting teachers came by this AM to bring me flowers and cookies for my birthday. I was irritated b/c they didnt' call - and we had sceduled for tomorrow; I was on my out of the door when the came by. But they thought of me! They brought me a gift for my birthday! Then my home teacher came by tonight - I haven't seen him in 2 months, so that was nice. There was another article in the Ensign about wayward children - those that take a different path. One that disagrees w/ how the Lord wants us to live. And how this mom was frustrated w/ her daughter - and her daughter's choices. After struggling several years w/ trying to correct her daughter's behavior and make her go back to the right path - she realized that she needed to change herself. And gradually those changes brought changes in her relationship w/ her daughter. It made me think of my sister. And how the path she is on totally disagrees w/ everything I believe in. And I realized that I judge her. And condemn her. And it's not my place to do that. That's the Lord's job. It's my place to love her and be an example to her. It hurts to look at myself like that. Of course I think it helped that she was nice today. She came by this evening to pay me for the scout uniform I bought her son today - and she brought me a birthday card. It said inside ""Thanks for everything"" and ""I love you"" - these were her words, not the cards. I don't remember the last time my sister wrote I love you in a card and I've never heard her say it. I didn't get her a card. I didn't even talk to her on her birthday. How petty of me. I have decided to try to change myself - to try to be more supportive or understanding or just there. An example of Christlike love. Less judgmental and condemning. Very hard to change, but I'm going to try. I need to spend more time w/ my scriptures and less time on this computer too. I swear I vow every night to change, but every day passes w/o change. So on my birthday tomorrow I will try harder. 

I am finding triggers for my anger. Like being alone - if I'm stressed or get stressed and I'm alone w/ the kids, I will more likely lose it than if Steve is here - or someone else. Also, noise really bothers me. I can't stand it when the kids get really loud. I was talking w/ Devin's counselor and Grace was getting very loud and it was hard to focus. I found myself feeling trapped and smothered. I could feel panic or anxiety building - which leads to me blowing up. Luckily I was in public and I control myself better - afraid of CPS I guess or what others will think. I also feel this way in crowds. At Walmart the other day - it was very crowded. It rained for over a week straight and this day it stopped for a bit. So everyone was out. We had lots of shopping to do and it took awhile. I felt anxious and nervous - felt trapped. I could feel it in my stomach and throat. That usually leads to me being mean to my family. I'm afraid to lose it in public and the stress of hiding it or holding back - when I get alone w/ my family I can let loose. And it comes out. I hate that. It's good though that I'm finding triggers. This will help me learn to cope w/ the triggers - I hope - so that I can then cope w/ the blowups and anger. 

Not much else to say. My birthday is in 15 minutes. I suppose I should at least get ready for bed and try to get Grace asleep. She's tired and I need to tend to her. She is another thing I'm extremely grateful for - she knows just how to make me laugh. I love her so very much. Time to go snuggle."

"event","Oh, I'm so depressed! I didn't get to church today b/c we're flooded in again! It's over the curb and up the driveway about 6' - 19' more to go before it gets to the house. At least we're at a slope - so even though it's at 6' up the driveway, that's just the water line. It's not deep. But I can't get out to go to church. And I worked late on the YW newsletter! And it looks so good! I probably could make it if my van was facing the other way. Like if I had backed it in yesterday. But I'd have to back out and it dips at the edge of the road so my exhaust would be under the water. And I could probably turn the van around - but my luck, we'd get stuck in the yard. 
We went to Walmart yesterday and you'd think it was a tourist place - it was SO crowded! It's rained all week and only drizzled all day yesterday - w/ the occasional downpour - so everyone must have decided to get out at the same time to shop. I hate crowded stores too b/c I get panicky - like I'm trapped. So I did NOT have fun shopping. I still have to shop for my sister's party stuff - but I put it off til tomorrow. If the rain doesn't stop - I'll have to wait til later in the week. I still need to go to the dollar store too and pick up supplies for the platoon. Mom and I are on a discussion board together and we (the board) adopted a military platoon. We still need to send out stuff to Kim who's going to mail at the end of the week. So I was going to the dollar store tomorrow so on Tuesday we could ship. That may be out too. I'm SO depressed!
My sister took her yearly trip to Uvalde - it's been pouring there too! lol! She called mom yesterday, but mom didn't get the message until last night. They've packed up and were heading to Mexico. Presumably they are trying to get away from the rain. But I still thinks it's kind of funny. Her vacation is ruined! lol! 
Steve and I went to a birthday party yesterday for a friend of his. It was fun! We've been together for almost 9 years and I had no clue that my bday and Rex's were only 5 days apart. We stayed for almost 3 hours! The kids were great during that time. I'm so glad Rex's wife, Melissa had her kids there. Her oldest was so well behaved and kept our boys entertained. After the cake, Grace fell asleep and slept the rest of the time. 
Oh, when we got home and finally went to bed - after midnight - Grace was still wide away and she watched TV w/ daddy. Finally she fell asleep next to the love seat. So Steve moved to the couch and fell asleep. At some point during the night - she woke Steve up ""daddy daddy"". Steve woke up and looked at her - she said ""moo"" and pushed him. So he scooted over and she crawled up and fell back asleep next to him again. Too sweet! She loves her daddy. 
I finished my mood chart - well got it caught up to date anyway. I go back to my counselor on the 4th - I think. So I needed it updated. I did a good job! 
Oh well, that's it for me. I'm sad b/c I can't go to church. I have cabin fever big time!"

"event","Well I haven't posted in a couple days. It's been pretty hectic. I'm very moody right now - that ""time"". Lucky me. I went to the new Sam's w/ my mom on Tuesday, but we didn't get to look at everything we wanted - she wanted to get home to watch her show. She hadn't set the VCR b/c we thought the store opened earlier than they did. But we got some stuff. Got prices on others - to compare at other stores before we need to buy. I've tried to keep the house clean, but I haven't been too motivated. I signed Devin up for cub scouts and had told my sister that her son couldn't join, I didn't think, until the next year, b/c I was under the impression it was based on age. But when I got there and found out it was based on school grade - I took an application to her apt (right down the street) and got her son signed up too. I also felt cornered to sign up as a parent volunteer. Scouts will be on Wednesday evenings at 5 so I have to pick up my nephew from daycare and take him, volunteer at scouts, then attend opening exercises for the Young Women (at least the opening exercises) before going home. Karate is on Mondays, and I was hoping to join myself this time, but I'm thinking that's out of the question. We're considering signing Tony up, not this next session, but the one after - I think December or January. He will be 6 then. Maybe when we get him signed up - then I'll join. That way maybe my MIL can watch (or my step mom) Grace while Tony goes at 6 (and Devin too if he wants a 2 hour practice), then Devin at 7 and then me at 8. Maybe. Anyway, I've also volunteered to be a room mom or something at the school - and that meeting (I'm guessing to make assignments?) is on Thursday morning next week. So I'm guessing I'll start volunteering once a week - hopefully I can take Grace. She is such a pain though - always running away. I don't see how I can volunteer and get a sitter every week though. I'll attend the meeting and see how that goes. So on Mondays, Devin has counseling and karate. Tuesdays I usually have counseling while the boys are in school. It's also one of the days I volunteered to be at the school. Wednesday is scouts and YW in the evening. Thursday is another day I said I was available. And then Friday's I meet w/ Michelle so her baby and mine can get together to play and me and her can talk and have a bit of fun. I wonder when I will have the time to learn to sew like I wanted, make my Christmas ornaments, organize my house. I'm guessing I need to make one goal a day - like clean out my kitchen junk drawer or organize my closet or make 5 ornaments. And leave it at that. Next week is a pain - Monday the boys are off school, and Devin has his karate test. Tuesday, I have counseling (something else too but I can't remember what right now). Wednesday is scouts and YW. Thursday I have the parent volunteer meeting, my visiting teachers want to come by and Devin has counseling. Friday I meet w/ Michelle (hopefully) and also need to do last minute shopping for my sister's party. I also need to go to the mall wednesday or after to pick up our family pics. Saturday I have ""basic training"" for scout volunteer leaders. And Sunday is the party. Whew! And I thought I was busy when I had a ""job""!
Becca emailed me - we've been talking about depression and how my counselor notices that I'm more depressed on Sundays. Becca says she notices it w/ me at ""that"" time of the month (which usually falls on the weekend - Sundays). So I went to church on Sunday and felt SO depressed. I couldn't shake it. I was glad I was there - but yuck. I tried to talk to one lady - the YW president - about it while we were in the foyer. But I don't think she gets it - plus I don't reveal things all the way either b/c people think I'm depressed all the time if I do. Or weird. I was miserable all day. We had family pics w/ my dad - and my sister made me very angry - then I got angry w/ my son and had that guilt and misery to deal w/. I think I cleaned on Monday, but I know I felt like crap - cancelled going to Sam's w/ my mom. Took the van to the shop and got the a/c working; Devin had karate that night. Went to Sam's the next day w/ mom. I noticed that my bladder was acting weird. I kept having to go to the bathroom but I didn't have any pain or anything. Like I would expect w/ an infection - but the frequency was mimicking an infection. I mentioned to mom that I thought it was werid. The weather had been nasty all week so it was rainy that day. Got home and finally got a nap. I missed my counseling appt so I had to call to reschedule. I signed Devin up for scouts and came home. I ended up being in pain (bladder) for most of the night so I didn't get to bed until 3:30AM. But about midnight I went to the bathroom and found out I started! The last several months I've been right at 28 days but I hadn't really looked at a calendar and thought I had a couple more days or maybe even next week. I was dead on 28 days. Plus I usually spot for a day or two. I didn't do that. Great. At least I almost always start at home. Anyway, got to bed, and had to get up 3-1/2 hours later. I dragged but all day long. I did manage to get a little bit more cleaning done. Fedex delivered my stroller! yea! Except it has rained every day this week so I can't use it! But I take Grace for rides thru the house and she has a blast. She loves it! I did manage to steam clean the living room carpet today and also made brownies. But geez! They're already gone! We're a bunch of pigs! lol! It's flooding now. Actually it's starting to recede, but we've had 2 tornado warnings for our county. Man, when Allison hit, what - a couple months ago? - our street never covered w/ water while other places were many many feet deep. But this flood today? *At least* 4 foot deep in the street! It creeped up our driveway - luckily we live w/ the houses up a slope from the street - until it got to my back tires on the van - a good 10 feet from the curb! I packed an emergency back pack w/ all our important documents and papers. I really need to make a 72 hour kit. It was crazy! I cleaned out our closet - our refuge for tornados but we didn't need it. And we watched the water rise and rise. Our small town was even on the news! Of course they have to pick the biggest hillbillies to talk to! What a bunch of crazy people! The boys were scared to sleep in their room, but my oldest is in his bed. My youngest son is in our closet on the floor w/ his pillow and blanket. He felt safer in there - since we'd all go there during a tornado anyway. I worry though that Devin is still on the other side of the house should he have to come. Luckily Grace sleeps w/ us. So Steve would have to go grab Devin while I got me and Grace in the closet and Tony's already there. The rain seems to have stopped for awhile  but there's more coming. So it will continue during the night. Our street is still flooded - though it has receded several feet down our driveway. But the ditch it flows into is outside it's banks and that intersection - just down the road and around the corner - is closed. Anymore rain will make it very difficult. The current was strong too in the road - steve went out to measure the depth and it almost knocked him down! 
Well, I'm meeting w/ Michelle tomorrow at McDs - for play day - hopefully I'll get to go. She likes to go early! Juliette gets up early though -even on the days she sleeps ""in""! They'll be there between 8 and 9 - grace and I don't like to get up before 10! lol! So it'll be an early day. Hopefully though we'll get an early nap and get to bed in the evening at a decent hour. Nothing planned this weekend! Yea! 
Oh, yeah, I've been in a spiritual mood today. Listening to Afterglow and Janice Kapp Perry. It's been nice. If only I would pick up the scriptures and read. I should do that. now they are packed in the ""to go"" back pack! lol! Well, I'm off to check my boards and turn the computer off so I can go to bed. Steve has to get up at 4AM and its' midnight almost! I don't know how he manages w/ so little sleep. 
Oh and Grace has picked up some more words - ""cow"" for couch, ""happite"" for happy, ""tow"" for towel, ""kie"" for sky. Talkative little thing"

"event","Well, I got most of my stuff done. The bathroom got straightened. The clothes all got folded and hung up and put away. All the dishes got done. I never got around to vacuuming the living room or cleaning any further in the kitchen. Oh well. Karate was okay, but the test is actually next Monday - he's ready though. Dad never stopped by. I did get my van to the shop and Kent went to drain the a/c. But when he popped the hood - he saw condensation from my defroster (it rained and my windows fogged up) - so he got to checking. ANd the compresser had a valve that was stuck open - so fixed that and my A/C WORKS!!!!! YEA!!!! It was a cold ride home! lol! I bought some valerian root - but I only took 2 pills instead of the recommended 3. Plus it was like 11PM when I took it and I didn't get to sleep til about midnight - thanks to a very hyper daughter. And I didn't sleep good either - kept waking up for various reasons. Maybe it'll work better tonight, when I can take it earlier and also when Steve's home. I never sleep good when he's out of town. 

As much as I want to go back to bed - I'm making breakfast and getting dressed and going to get mom to go to Sam's. So I guess I have to start getting ready for that. I'm soooooooo sleepy. Hey - good thing I'm driving! (not really)"

"event","Well, so much for shopping. I was so tired and my head hurt when I got up w/ the boys that I emailed mom and asked if we could go tomorrow. I was going back to bed. I got up about 9:30 and got to work a bit. I've cleaned about 1/2 the house - maybe less. But laundry has piled up - clean and dirty, so I'm doing that. Plus all the dishes that piled up. I'm telling you, I did nothing this entire weekend. I did manage to clean the office and vacuum. Then I steam cleaned the carpet. I'm not impressed w/ the oxyclean - it's working no different that regular carpet cleaner thru a steam cleaner. Oh well, at least the carpet got cleaned. I did have to empty the resevoir - GROSS! Just one pass thru that room was awful! It was such dirty filthy, nasty water! Unfortunately, the vacuum cleaner isn't working right now, so I can't start on the living room, which really really really needs it! Steve is leaving for Midland in a couple hours. He's on his way home right now to pick up some stuff and let Cody get packed. Rene was supposed to go w/ Steve but he ended up needing to be at Anadrill for the lots of work they have. So they are sending Cody. So Steve will look at the vacuum cleaner when he gets here. 

Anyway, clothes are folded but I still need to hang some up. Plus what I'm washing. Hopefully I will be able to stay on top of it and not poop out too quick. Dishes are only 1/3 of the way done - but I'm heading in there in a minute to do the next sink full. The floor is picked up in the living room - it just needs to be vacuumed. Actually I may dust today - really really needs it - so I may do that too before vacuuming. The kitchen table is finally cleared off but the glass is really really dirty! I hate glass top tables! Especially when they are inlaid in wood or whatever. Food and junk gets caked inbetween the glass and wood. Nasty! And it's a pain to clean! So I've got that too, plus clean the kitchen - you know, the counters and floor. The floor is really really bad! Steve HAS to get the vacuum working b/c I don't want to sweep - the vacuum does bare floors. Then I can ""mop"" (actually it's me on hands and knees scrubbing. ugh). PLUS I still have to go to STR to get my a/c drained and be here for the boys when they get off the bus. I'm guessing I'm not getting a nap today. At least Devin doesn't have counseling. He does have karate and it's test night so he's got to study. Which means of course that I need to find his book. Great. Something else to do. And I haven't even touched the bathroom. Maybe the chores for the boys today will be one does the bedroom and the other does the bathroom. I think that's fair since I'm doing the rest. 

OH YEAH - I forgot Dad was coming over too. Better get back to work. Oh man! Now Grace pooped. What a day."

"event","I hate pain. I feel like my entire life revolves around pain - how much I'm having and what I can or can't tolerate. I have to get up in a few hours for church - I haven't gone in 3 weeks and really need to go - and yet I can't get to bed b/c of pain. And if it's not physical, then it's emotional. 

I've been studying two aspects of the Church - one is the ""evidences"" of the book of Mormon. Archeological evidences discovered in the last 50 years or so. It's incredible! I'm saving these for a time when Steve may actually be interested. I was actually hopeful. The other aspect is the Last Days. I'm reading a book by Roger K. Young (As a Thief in the Night) and it goes over everything in Revelations and Daniel and various other sources - including more specific LDS sources (B of M, quotes from authorities, D & C). It's very thought provoking and scary at the same time! I've also been reading the mainstream Christian fiction novels ""Left Behind"" and the series. It's based on a more fundamentalist view of the Last Days - a more literal translation. Good books but not accurate to my beliefs. Anyway, back to Roger K. Young. I was trying to explain what he says in this book to Steve - and he's SO not interested. He says there was a time when he got caught up in reading materials about the last days, but he ""discovered"" that getting ""worked up"" over this does nothing but cause anxiety. According to him, there's nothing we can do except be spiritually prepared. Well, I don't buy that - b/c I believe in being physically prepared also. Such as a food storage. He's not opposed to it, just doesn't see the benefit of it. Well, even if the Last Days doesn't bear the necessity of a food storage - say he loses his job or gets hurt on the job! It could come in handy then! Plus, what does he expect - if we refuse ""the mark of the Beast""! We will most likely die anyway, he says; but if we don't - we can't buy or sell! I started reading him some other stuff and he has a ""panic attack"". I mean, maybe he did or just chest pains, but it just seemed coincidental. He didn't want to hear what I was reading. It hurt me! He did come to me afterwards and asked me to continue and maybe I'm being self centered, but I didn't want to continue. i'm not going to argue w/ him - but I can't stand that we don't see eye to eye on religion! How can we not see the same when it comes to the Last Days! I don't want to face it alone! Yet, he thinks this great rapture is going to occur - and if we're faithful enough, we'll disappear! BUT HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING to get to a spiritual point of even being raptured!!! (not that I believe it anyway) I have wondered - what will happen if we survive to the point that we need to make our way to New Jerusalem? I'm going! W/ the children - if they are still young enough to be at home. But I know in my heart, that I will go alone, and against much opposition if the kids are still there. It does seem kind of cultish if you look at from an outsiders point of view - but if he would just study and pray - he would know! I have realized tonight that he will never take me from Church - I may stray now and then, but in my heart, I know it's true. And if I stray, it's from meetings, not from my beliefs. And if I had to come down to choosing between him and the Church, it wouldn't be him I choose! And that scares me to death! I feel like he's my soul mate - yet I can't turn my back on God or my eternal salvation! To do that would sign my condemnation - my place in the afterlife. And my salvation is worth so much more than any earthly joy or comfort. But it hurts. I feel like there's this huge canyon between us now. I haven't prayed enough - or really at all. I haven't studied enough. And I haven't been an example - and what if I run out of time b/c I goofed off? I don't want to face eternity w/out him by my side, but I will do it if I have to. It's just so scary and lonely feeling. 

Hopefully I can go to bed now. Hopefully the pain will ease and I can get in a few good hours. I also have pictures w/ dad tomorrow - so I won't get a nap. And of course, no a/c in my van - still. The auto parts sold a defective condenser. So we are filing a claim for all the parts that we wasted b/c the condenser crapped out - such as freon. If I don't dip into savings - to replace the parts while we wait on the claim - it could be 4 to 6 weeks before we get our money. Or we can try again next weekend. I just want my a/c fixed! By the time it gets fixed, I won't need it and I'll still need my fan fixed for the heater to work good. I feel like my van is falling apart - I still need a passenger side mirror, the headliner is falling, the leather seats are cracking, the back speakers are blown or not working right, the a/c doesn't work, the fan only works on med/low and med/high - not low or high. I think that's it. At least a couple weeks ago he finally fixed the passenger window so it rolls down - it was hades riding around w/ no a/c and a window that couldn't roll down. Oh well, enough griping. I know it's not his fault, but I'm actually in a gripey mood today. First time in a couple weeks. Wonder if I'm PMSing or starting to cycle again. I can't wait til wednesday when my stroller gets here!"

"event","I noticed I didn't write yesterday. I'm just so tired. I did go to my counselor and we talked. She thinks the last couple weeks have possibly been stressful for me and wants to see if it's still going on it a couple more weeks. She also brought up sleep deprivation. I haven't slept thru the night since I was 11 years old - waking up several times a night. So I'm going to try some valerian root - recommended by Becca ;) - mom says it's not a good shot though b/c if I have a chemical imbalance it won't work. But if I'm just sleep deprived, maybe I don't have a chemical imbalance after all? Also, I just bought (off ebay) a jogging stroller and hope to have it next week. After the boys get on the bus in the AM, I'm planning on getting dressed and waking Grace up and heading to the college to walk. Walking at night w/ Paula is fun, but I'm thinking I need the endorphin rush in the AM so my day will be more productive. Also my counselor says that early morning light is the most therapeutic for depression. I really hope all this works.

I got to volunteer for Meals on Wheels yesterday too and that was fun! I agreed to volunteer every month now - it's only one day out of the month. I'm looking forward to it! It was nice to serve the elderly again! I do miss my job sometimes when I got to help them. 

Poor Steve had a tooth pulled on Tuesday and is in pain. Now it looks like the hole is filled w/ pus and his breath reeks!! Yuck! He goes back to the dentist today at 3. I'm worried about him. He still has 5 more cavities that need to be taken care of ASAP - so there goes the tax rebate check. Oh well. I really need to clean but I'm all pooped out - just so very tired. Steve just got home, I wonder if i could lay down? Of course, I've only been up for 2 hours! Maybe I could run to the herb store. Get the valerian root. 

That's all for today. I'm tired and have nothing else to say or do."

"event","What a day. It hasn't exactly been bad, but I have just been so very very tired. All I could think of was making to nap time. Luckily though, Grace took an early nap - about 3PM. Lately she's been napping in the early evening so she ends up late at night. Steve was home b/c he had a tooth pulled. He was reading and watching TV w/ the boys so I laid down. I always feel worse after a nap - I don't know why I take them! But I'm just so tired, I can't help but think it will make me feel better. I didn't get to walk tonight. I'm starting to think of walking in the AM. I'm going to look for a jogging stroller - at a resale shop, preferably - and if I find one, I'm going to try to start walking after the boys go to school. That way, it's not too hot when I go and hopefully I'll get my endorphins going so I can make thru the day. Maybe actually get some work done around the house. I'm just so sick of being tired. I really wonder how this can possibly be an effect of the depression! I'm hardly feeling depressed these last couple weeks - and not hypomanic either - so how can this be depression? I *want* to get up and do things! I *want* to have energy! But I don't! How can that be depression??? Yet, I've had my thyroid checked, my glucose levels, my iron levels. What else? Someone told me to have my chiropractor check me out - yet he doesn't do that - he's not into kinesiology, just does adjustments. And I have looked all around town for a chiro that does more -yet I can't find one. But if I go back to my doctor (whom I like a lot) - I *know* he'll just tell me ""depression"" related. I go see my therapist tomorrow and I *know* she'll say the same thing. And worse, I know she'll start pushing for drugs. And I so much don't want to do that! When I stopped the herbs though, I did stop the Vitalerbs also - herbal vitamins - so maybe I need to start those again. I sure hope that helps! And I pray I find a stroller tomorrow. 

I had a great day yesterday - as far as emotions. I had 3 friends email me and one friend call me! It made me feel liked and feel important! I want to start looking at positive things that happened during the day - things the Lord blessed me w/ that day. Yesterday it was my friends; my realization of the importance of the Gospel in my life. And small things - like the boys didn't fight and they both were excited to start school. 

Today I'm grateful for the love my daughter gives me all the time! She is so loving and funny. Such a blessing to our lives. I'm grateful for my husband and his love and support of me - even when he's not feeling well, he still puts me first! I wish I was more like him. I'm grateful for the patience I've had today - I mean I did yell a bit this evening, but it was when the boys were being loud while Steve was trying to rest (he had a tooth pulled). But I helped Devin w/ his homework w/out feeling like I had other things more important to do. And I'm grateful for the Gospel. I'm on a study group and one lady is sharing many articles that point to the truthfullness of the Gospel and show that it's not some fabrication of a semi-literate farm boy. I'm grateful the Lord is there to pick me up when I'm down and to hold my hand when I feel scared. 

Grace has learned some new words. Yesterday she said 3 new ones: light (yight), bus (bush - w/ the 'uh' sound) and happy (happete). Today she says hot dog! It sounds more like dead duck - but if she says it slowly, it's hot dog. Plus we had hot dogs for dinner so I *know* that's what she's saying! it's just adorable but she's growing and advancing way too fast. 

I'd better go - the boys need to say prayers and get to bed. Steve wants to watch a movie tonight (October Sky). Plus I need to get a shower. I'm volunteering for meals on wheels tomorrow w/ a lady from church. Her daughter usually goes w/ her - her daughter is anorexic and was homebound - but she reentered school this year. We're all praying for the best. ANyway, Mary needed a new partner so she called me. I'm nervous. I hate new situations, but I need to serve others and this is a great opportunity. And it's only once a month. Plus counseling tomorrow. We'll see how that goes. Shoot! I need to find someone to be here when the boys get off the bus - I may be a few minutes late getting here from the counselor! Something else I need to do!"

At some point Devin ended up beside me in bed - I *hate* being in the middle on the bed. Of course I had to pee and crawl over him just to get out. Then I laid down on the couch and a bit later - a couple hours maybe? - Grace woke up. So I carried her to bed and laid her in the middle. The alarm eventually went off for Steve but of course he was late getting up. Why does he set an alarm when he just rolls over? Plus he never hears it - I have to get up to turn it off and wake him up. I feel like it's just another kid. He finally left and he also got Devin to get out of our bed. So I got about 45 minutes of sleep before the alarm went off again - this time for me. Why can't I be the June Cleaver mom? Make breakfast, be chipper and happy? All I can think is giong back to bed."

"event","Forgot to mention that I was discussing Tony's tantrums w/ someone recently and food allergies were brought up. I said i would look into it, not really thinking much about it though. Then she mentioned allergies to dairy - specifically milk protein causing tantrums and mood changes. And it dawned on me that Tony's been allergic to milk protein in the past - from birth! We finally got him to tolerate milk when he was almost 3. It never occurred to me that his symptoms of allergies would switch from diarrhea, yeast infections, etc to that of mood changes. I'm going to document his milk intake and see if there is a connection - obvious connection. Steve won't let me ban milk from the house - yet."

"event","Oh I'm SO tired! I don't remember where I left off at - oh well. I'll try to update my last couple of days. 

Yesterday AM Steve took Devin to the karate tourney - they had to get there early and we'd show up when he was ready to fight. It was only a couple minutes from the house. I managed to do almost all our laundry in a couple hours - and finished the last couple loads when we got home. Of course they are all still on the loveseat - laid out to be hung up or piled high to be folded. That's a  job for today. Anyway we went and they were still doing musical kata's then they had to do the grand champion musical and traditional katas. There was this little boy there that looked about 5 or 6 - but I'm guessing he was just little and was probably 7 at least. Anyway, he was doing katas and he was AWESOME! So we waited then they started lining the white and yellow belts up (Devin is a white) and got them lined up in groups to fight; then brought in the orange, green and blue and then the rest. Devin was 3rd up to fight in his group. He would fight the loser (I think) and then if he won, he would fight the winner of the 1st fight. It was double elimination, but I can't remember how that was explained. Anyway, Devin won both fights!!! He got a 1st place trophey!!! We are so excited and of course, so was he! He was jumping up and down just thrilled to death! They didn't have team fights -we found out they only do that 1st and 3rd tournaments (I think) so next time they'll do it. Wait, maybe it was 2nd and 4th b/c I think this was the 3rd of the year. I don't know. I took some pics and hope to get them developed soon so I can put them on his webpage. Grace was so funny b/c she was going up to kids that were like 7 or so and kicking and punching them! They'd play back w/ her - it was cool. 

Oh, forgot about Friday night. We went to the ice breaker for the reunion - I was disappointed and was determined to leave as soon as we finished eating. It was pretty boring. For those that didn't pay in advance, there was supposed to be a $10 fee to get in but there wasn't anyone at the doors managing that. We were also under the impression that food and stuff would be provided - hence the fee. But of course we had to pay for our own meals. I didn't eat - nibbled a bit off Grace's plate - but I just can't eat a meal in front of people I don't know or know very well. We met up w/ a few people - most I didn't remember. It was weird though having the really popular girls coming up and saying hi - when I was not popular and was usually a source of jokes for them. Things change in 10 years I guess. Maybe they don't remember the torment I was put thru. I hated (and loved) my high school years. I hated the torment and being the butt of jokes all the time, but I made some really neat friends and that made it so worth it. Plus those were the years I discovered who I was. Then there was this guy that came up and introduced himself - I didn't connect at first, not til he walked off. He'd changed a lot - but the name rang a bell and eventually the neurons connected in my underused brain - lol - and this was guy that I didn't necessarily hang out w/, but I think we had the same friends or something. He was a quiet person and a loner (it seemed to me) and he always intrigued me. Not like a crush, but kind of - he seemed troubled a lot and guys like that drew me for some reason. Like I wanted to be the person that could fix them or something like that. So he intrigued me. Someone I remember watching but never had to guts to really get to know. I regret that now. B/c he and his wife are SO COOL! Him and Steve seemed to get along great! And when we left Saturday night, he said ""I like him"" which is saying a lot - b/c Steve can get along great w/ anyone but not really like them or want to go out of his way to spend time w/ them. And the girls I usually become friends w/, he usually doesn't like the husbands - so no couples to do things w/. That's okay too b/c I don't generally like the husbands! lol! Anyway, while we were eating (before Richard and Betty came up) I told Steve, if this doesn't change by the time we are done eating - we are out of here! Rick and Betty intro'd themselves and went on their way. Eventually Grace became a handful and there were kids on the patio so i thought I'd take her out there to run - Steve was talking to a girl he'd gone to church with. Betty was out there w/ her kids and after a few minutes we started talking about the kids. Kids are great ice breakers! She is such a neat person. What was really really weird though was her oldest son had a diaphragmatic hernia when he was born and so did my 2nd son. Her situation was so much worse - though - b/c her son needed 3 surgeries b/c they wouldn't work! I can't imagine! Tony was very very sick for 2 months but it was his colon problems (twisted thru the hole in his diaphragm) and not the hernia that caused problems. It was a very small hernia. And he did almost die on Christmas '95 - and would have had it not been for Steve insisting to call the dr. on that day (I wanted to wait one more day). By the time we got to the hospital we was blue and would have died w/in the hour - God was really prompting my husband to take care of our son. But I can't imagine giving birth to a baby that was so tragically ill! And having to go thru that fear of surgery so soon after birth - then again a month (I think) later - then again a year later! How horribly terrifying. Her son is named Steven - thought that was neat. He's 9. Anyway, I was all ready to leave earlier in the evening and then we all ended up being the absolute last people to leave! Oh, Tony called about 10 or so (we were late and his mom was babysitting). He told his daddy that we were late and then wanted to talk to me. He again said that we were late - I said ""well, is grandma mad?"" He said ""no, it's just that...well, I'm tired!"" haha! I said ""well, go to bed!"" Him: ""oh, okay! Bye!"" Too funny! Turned out though even when we got home that they were still up. And Grace! Wow! That girl did not go to sleep until after 1AM I think. What is up w/ her?!

So Saturday night we were late getting there. Had to go to Payless to get Steve some shoes. He took Grace in while I talked w/ my sister's ex-husband (he was coming out of the restaurant next door). They didn't have anything and so we left to drop the kids off. Got to mom's and I had to call Payless back b/c Steve let Grace take her sunglasses in and she dropped them in there. Normally I wouldn't care, but Grace loves those glasses (her eyes) and they hold up really well to her - she's had them for 2 months and they have yet to be destroyed. Anyway, they had them and are holding them for me. We went into Clear Lake and stopped at a strip center that had a Palais Royal and Fox Den - Fox Den was horribly expensive!! So we tried Palais Royal - not much better, but we both got shoes (buy one get one 1/2 off) and that took some time. FINALLY we got on our way but we didn't have time to eat. They were only having hor d'erves. We got there about 1 hr late. Luckily we saw someone we knew right off the bat. So we didn't have to socialize w/ people we didn't know or like or worse, stand around looking dumb until we saw someone. So we visited. Richard was w/ the person we knew. Eventually Betty made her way over. We spent most of the night talking and visiting w/ others. The bar downstairs was cheaper and faster so there were several trips downstairs. Luckily water was free - that's all Betty and I drank! I'm not sure for Richard, but Steve drank a lot! He drinks wine, but he had 6 or 7 glasses (from his recollection - I don't know). He was very funny and acting silly - more so than normal, so I *knew* he was buzzing. I was tempted so hard to drink. It's very hard for me to resist that temptation but I know it's wrong to go against my beliefs. Steve said it was good b/c we have always had an agreement that if one of us drank, the other wouldn't - so one was always sober to drive. But that never even occured to me - the only thing keeping me from drinking was my convictions. But Satan tempted very very hard. Alcohol is the only thing I've found to really loosen me up and allow me to have fun and relax and be myself. I'm always so reserved around bunches of people - afraid to say or do something wrong or embarrassing. And alcohol helps me to loosen those inhibitions (or inbibitions as I once said while drunk! lol) and I become very funny and silly like Steve. Only thing I was really disappointed in myself over though was my mind was in the gutter most of the night - lol - and I cussed a few times. I didn't like that. Anyway, around midnight Betty and Richard mentioned going to see a movie - so we called mom and she said she would watch them late. So we drove together and went to see Rush Hour 2. It was SO funny! It was so nice to laugh and have fun - and even to stay out late w/o the kids. I feel bad for mom having to watch them so late and I think Grace was a pain; but we really needed this time to just be us. I felt bad on the way home too b/c I thought RH2 was a RR movie - and I don't like to watch those; but I found out this am that it's actually PG-13 so that was cool! I fell in love w/ Steve all over again b/c of how silly he is! That's what drew me to him from the beginning - it was never looks or money or anything like that; it was his ability to make me laugh! That is so sexy to me! And Richard and Betty were an absolute blast! So we exchanged info and came home. Sad thing w/ Rich and Betty are that they live 10+ hours away from here! We finally find a couple we really connect w/ and we had such an awesome time w/ them - and they have to live so blasted far away! But they invited us out for Christmas! How fun to do something for Christmas besides the normal! I hope we do it and they can still have us. We picked the kids up and got home about 4AM.

Steve left early to go get my a/c fixed and they fixed most of it, but now it seems my condenser is bad. Lucky me. Another week w/o an a/c. I was mad at first - and took it out of Steve. Well, I just made him feel bad, but it's not his fault. And what's one more week. At least the kids are in school and ride the bus to and from, so I don't have to drive. So Steve finally crashed about noon today and I want to go wake him up - so we can do things on his last day of vacation, but I know he needs his sleep. My house is a mess and I didn't go to church for the 3rd week in a row (no vehicle and I didn't wake up til 11AM). I keep this up and it will be very hard to keep going! Oh well, my hearts in the right place, circumstances just keep me from it (Tony's ear infection one week, camping the next, and now no vehicle at the time and exhausted). Unfortunately I need to go clean the house - fold clothes and clean the kitchen; and then go to Kroger's to buy school supplies (they have them pre-packaged per grade so I don't need to find each individual item). I dont' want to shop on a Sunday, but I will b/c I was too lazy to do it during the week. 

School starts tomorrow and I'm hoping life returns to normal. Devin does have counseling at 4 tomorrow and then karate at 6 - so once school's out it will be rush rush. Then I have counseling on Wednesday at 2 - I'm still not sure how to manage that. They get off the bus at 3:20 - maybe I can get my MIL to come over and wait? Or my mom? I hate to ask mom since she babysat for us SOOOOO late! We'll see. 

I am just so hyped b/c I had a really good weekend and I thought it would totally suck! I'm SO glad Richard and Betty were there and we got to visit. Steve said something funny - he said that Friday night he thought they must be really boring people to end up spending so much time visiting w/ us - they must have had nothing better to do! lol! Oh well, I think we're pretty interesting and Steve is just a riot! Oh, Richard works for Border Patrol, so before Steve and him met, Steve was going to go up to him and say something like ""Hey! I know you! You busted me for a 1/2 oz(gram, whatever) of cocaine! too bad you missed all the pot I had!"" lol! We kept bugging him to do it, but he never did. He was also going to act like an old girlfriend that had a sex change. Oh and Saturday night - there was another class that was having a reunion downstairs and we talked about going in there and acting like we knew people - he's just a riot! Anyway, I'd better go get my stuff done - or at least get dressed!"

"event","You know, I""ve noticed I spend most of my time just documenting what I've done during the day, and not really listing feelings or thoughts. I'm thinking it's b/c I try to keep my mind busy so I dont' feel or think - maybe. I don't know. 

We had family pics done today and they turned out great! I'm so excited! Steve scanned them in, so now I need to take the time to upload them to a webpage so I can show them off! I actually look 1/2 decent! We had one taken of just me and him and I love it! We've never had one like that before - so this is neat. 

I got to go to kindergarten orientation w/ Tony tonight - just me and him. I really like that time w/ my kids. But I notice that he talks A LOT! lol! He likes his teacher and I like her too! A couple kids in his class he already knows so that will make things easier. I volunteered - or filled out the form anyway. Since I'm not working, I think it's an important use of my time. Plus w/ Tony's temper problems, maybe I can mediate w/ his teacher - or at least be closer to her so problems can be bounced off each other. I feel like I have so much to do before Monday when school starts! I still need to get them uniforms!!

We went to mom's tonight so Steve could help work on the play fort again. After orientation, I went back - to get Steve and the other kids - and my sister was there. Happy happy joy joy. My sister is the biggest slut I know! She is so into herself. She is always talking about how many guys look at her, hit on her, want to date or screw her, etc. She seems genuinely astounded that they do this! Yet she dresses very provacotively; either short or low cut or see thru or tight, etc. She flirts like it's going out of style - she is a tease. Hinting at promises to come then shoots 'em down the first chance she gets. She was married and then had a son. Her husband got involved w/ golf - she became a golf widow. Well my sister is high maintenace. Anyway he really loved the game and played a lot of days a week - after work. She got lonely and bored and probably felt neglected. So she started going out w/ her friends - only they were single. So she went to clubs and did ""single"" things. This led to trouble and she had an affair. Well her husband found out and he was hurt and then he had an affair. So they divorced. She got involved very heavily in the party scene - going out and getting drunk - falling down, can't remember anything, hangover the next AM drunk - 3-4 times a week after work. She just dumped her son w/ whoever would watch him. I remember several times her mentioning incidents like this: she finds herself in the parking lot of the club - in a car w/ a guy - making out and she doesn't remember going out there. I would not be surprised if she was date raped during that time. If so, she probably chalked it up to being too drunk to remember. She ended up pregnant and her and this guy tried to work it out several times. Living together and whatnot. They just didn't work. He was controlling and rude - from what I hear (I never saw it, though my mom says she did - since they lived w/ mom for a bit). So she was a single mom w/ 2 kids now. Eventually she was actually living on her own. This floored me b/c I could not see her living by herself - she admits to not liking being alone b/c it gives her too much time to think. She actually lived by herself for a few months - maybe a year. I don't remember. Anyway, her ex-husband and her eventually got back together. They were back together for a year or 2 and he treated her daughter like his own. Also, he wasn't as involved in golf as before. He allowed her some freedom to go and do things - she has a very active social life. But this year - they split up again. The funny thing is that he stuck around for a month. Let me explain - she was on a rodeo committee for the Houston Livestock show and Rodeo in February. She had worked for a couple years trying to get on this committee and finally made it. So she was very busy during this month. And he, knowing how important this was to her, stuck around so that the kids would be taken care of while she did her thing. As soon as rodeo was over, it was agreed that he would leave. When he did - she claimed he abandoned her. So now she's enjoying her single life and slutting around. She's found this nice guy - she just couldn't get over how much she liked him and how much they clicked - and he just wasn't her type. They were an ""item"" for about 3 months and then they broke up. Yet he stills stays over and they have sex - well now anyway. Last weekend they started that again. She said she just couldn't live w/o it and needed it. So she calls him. She says (in front of him) how she could have called anyone, but she called him. She gets mad when we poke fun at her and says we make her sound like a slut. Yet she does it herself. I said, in front of him, ""so you're using him"" and she laughs and says yes. And the really really sad part is this poor sap has feelings for her and feels like he might still have a chance. Yet he is losing every bit of dignity he has by letting her use him. 

Well, that's all the griping about her tonight. There is OH so much more I can tell - like her lack of mothering ability and my desire to call CPS on her (she gave her daughter Tylenol w/ codeine tonight so she would sleep - all so she wouldn't be bothered during sex and that's a very small part of her problems); or this blasted party. I really wish that was over. The party is really sad b/c no one - not a single person - in her family is excited for this party and really wanting to come. No one wants anything to do w/ her. It's very sad. OH - I have to share this. My sister is now jealous of my breast size!!! I have always been a great plains kind of person but w/ 3 kids and nursing them all - well, I've grown a bit. My sister on the other hand must have gotten my share when we hit puberty b/c she has big ones. She is jealous tonight b/c now I have ""big"" boobs and it's not just her anymore. She has always been jealous over me and probably always will be. And the sad part is there isn't anything to be jealous over. She was the ""pretty one"" and I was the ""smart"" one growing up. Then my senior year I modelled - she was horribly jealous there. We could never share anything - b/c it was always her against me. Yet I feel no competition. It's very very sad. 

Steve is out fishing tonight - he needs to do this while on vacation and I'm needing a vacation from him! He was really getting on my nerves today! I actually felt better w/ the break at orientation. I really truly love him - feel like he is my soul mate - but if I spend too much day to day time w/ him, I go bonkers! I actually dread retirement and I'm only 28! lol! 

Well, I'd better head to bed. Still didn't post many thoughts. I really want to upload at least one picture to share. Maybe I'll do that."

"event","Okay, where was I? Oh yeah, we'd packed up fishing and drove back to camp. I took the boys swimming and Steve came down w/ Gracie. Me and the boys had fun and then Grace wanted in so Steve changed her clothes and me and her had fun playing. The boys kepted bugging each other and I was worried one of them was going to get hurt so we got out and went back to camp. Oh I think we had lunch before swimming, but it may have been after. Anyway, I got tired and laid in the hammock. Grace was cranky b/c she was so sleepy - so Steve loaded the kids up and drove around the camp to get Grace to sleep - and also to let me get some quiet so I could sleep. Well, that didn't work - for me anyway. The ducks came around - did I mention those? They were hungry and wandered off to our new campsite neighbors. Well, these people had about a 14 or 15 yo girl there and all she could do was scream at the top of her lungs at the ducks and stand on the picnic table! The mom and the girls brother (I'm guessing) were chasing the ducks and they guy was saying something about making them for dinner. I got frustrated b/c I didn't want them to hurt the ducks - all they wanted was some food. If you left them alone, they'd leave. Or feed them. Anyway, I pulled out the rest of the bread and called the ducks over. That drew them away. By this time Steve had made it back and Grace was sleeping. Steve set the pan of beans down (from lunch) and the ducks went to town. It was hilarious to watch ducks eat those beans. They made this horrid mess on themselves! lol! Well, one of the ducks finally came over and I picked out the last two slices of bread that Ihad saved specifically for this duck - it was handicapped (it limped anyway) and I called it Handy Capp (like the cartoon - Andy Capp). Anyway, I about got attacked again from all the other ducks. It was almost scary. Well, they went on their way. The boys were griping about being bored and wanting to swim again. I was tired and cranky. The bugs were bothering Devin and he kept running all over the camp, etc. Steve was trying to sleep and I wouldn't let him. I'm so mean! lol! Finally the topic of a hotel came up and we ran w/ it! lol! We packed up camp in about an hour and clean up. Then we drove into town. We found a Holiday Inn Express - what is the difference between a regular Inn and an Express?? Anyway, Steve went in and initially he wanted to lie about the kids - not tell them we have any. I hated that idea - especially on a Sunday! Luckily the Lord was on my side and this hotel you had to go inside to get to your rooms - lol! It was about $70 for a room but he lied (again!) and got a corporate discount of $5 for us. Our room had 2 queen size beds, a big TV and 2 dressers, A/C (one of the most important features!), 2 phone lines *plus* internet connection (!); warm shower (the other most important feature) and a coffee maker. Oh and an ironing board and iron and the hotel had a washer and dryer! Plus a pool and ""deluxe continental breakfast""! lol! We were in heaven! We tag teamed showered. It was interesting. I jumped in first and about 5 minutes later Steve put Gracie in. I finished and started on Grace, then Steve jumped in as I got out. He finished Grace while I got dressed and then I got her out and we left the bathroom and tagged Devin. Devin got in just as Steve was getting out so after he got dressed - Steve tagged Tony to get in! lol! I said we should do this more often - we probably saved a ton of water compared to normal! lol! We got dressed and felt great! Walked across the parking lot to Pizza Inn and pigged out on bug free food. Came back and went swimming - no we did not wait the required 30 minutes after eating! lol! The boys had fun and the water felt great. It started to sprinkle about 8PM so we came inside. I started doing some laundry - to save for when we got home. The boys went to bed and Grace was totally wired! I finished laundry about 10 and Grace fell asleep about 10:30 so that was cool. I folded clothes and Steve came home. I also played on the internet. Steve had gone to clean out my van and repack everything. He came back and we went to bed. Got up in the AM - not sure what time - maybe 8:30 and went down to get breakfast. I had a horrible migraine headache but the Tylenol I took kicked it w/in an hour. We had a good breakfast and then headed back to the room to pack. Called my Grandma and asked her if we could come visit. 

Went to Grandma's house which was about 30 minutes away. Her lawn was getting high so Steve offered to mow. My grandma is in her mid to late 70's (I think 75, but not sure) and is in poor health. Plus there are few people she can rely on to help. Anyway, he got out the riding lawnmower and the tire fell off the wheel. It was dryrotted. He couldn't get the rim off b/c it was rusted on, so he unpacked the van and popped up the seats - then we loaded the riding mower into the back of our van. He drove to get it fixed. I got to visit w/ my Grandma for a long time. We talked about lots of things. Steve got back and mowed her 5 lots - even when it rained! lol! The kids had fun watching her TV - she has a satellite - and also playing w/ her dog. We left about 5. On the way home we stopped in Pearland at a new McDonalds for us to eat and also for the kids to play. Then we came home. It was about 8 by the time we got here. Whew! It's great to be home! lol! We began unpacking and just relaxing.

Not much has happened since then. Let's see - yesterday Steve actually fixed my passenger window so it rolls down all the way. Which is great since the a/c isn't working. But he's planning to get that fixed on Sunday! Yea! Also he got my van washed/waxed and detailed inside. That was nice. I worked on laundry and a bit of cleaning. Not much - just relaxing. Oh and we went to Walmart and broke the bank - lol! I finally got him that DVD player he's wanted and he bought Cast Away. They had the little plaster Christmas ornaments that you paint - I've been wanting some of those to exchange w/ others (I'm on an ornament exchange group). I'm so excited! Now I've got a reason to go to Hobby Lobby to buy paints! lol! Then I went walking last night w/ Paula. We didn't walk as far, but it was nice to get out of the house. 

Real quick - hopefully. Today we went to Space Center Houston w/ the boys. I am so exhausted! We spent $64 to get in - but it's b/c we bought the family membership. W/ parking it would have been $54 w/o the membership. So for 10 extra bucks we can go all year w/o any fees - even parking is free! Plus there are centers - and museums and stuff that are free w/ this membership - all over the world! Tony had a huge tantrum and I had to carry him out of the place and to the van. It lasted for about 1/2 hour. I had to restrain him the whole time. That was the worst part. Him screaming ""let me go"" and ""I hate you"" and then also fighting me - hitting, biting, scratching, head butting, kicking, etc. He's very strong and it's getting very hard for me. I tried to talk to Steve about it after it was over - that we need to find other ways to help him deal w/ his anger. He said if he's still doing this in a year or so we need to start whipping his butt. I hate this! These aren't normal temper tantrums ""I'm not getting what I want so I'm going to get mad until you give me what you"". These are anger control problem tantrums. He gets mad and doesn't know how to deal w/ it. As soon as he wears himself out = he's fine. He's apologetic and loving. He's also cooperative and back to being himself. And besides we've tried spanking him when he throws a fit and it just makes it last longer and makes it worse. There was a time when they were just about every day that I would have to sit on him to restrain him b/c he's so strong. I just feel like Steve doesn't get it - like he thinks Tony is just spoiled or something. I'VE been to counseling w/ these kids, I'VE heard what the counselors have said, I'VE been the one figuring out what works and what doesn't. NOT HIM! Like beating a child is the answer to everything! So that put a damper on the rest of the day. The cool thing was we watched a movie there and Devin really wants to be an astronaut! He's always loved space stuff - especially when Steve worked at NASA. So that was neat. Now we're home and I'm playing on the computer. Forgot about karate tonight - poor kid. Too late now and tomorrow is out of the question. So Steve is supposed to spar w/ Devin tonight. Problem is I've asked Steve to spar w/ him *every* night since last MOnday night and he doesn't. How does he expect the child to get better at it if he doesn't practice? And now Devin hasnt' been in a week and a half and is mad b/c he doesn't *want* to practice. SO I'm mad at Steve for it! lol! I'm supposed to go walking tonight again w/ paula. I hope so b/c I have some stress I need to work out. And I need to color my hair. We're doing family portraits tomorrow. I still need to go school clothes shopping too. ACK! I have NO idea what the kids will wear tomorrow! Or me or Steve! HELP! Too much to do and not enough time! I can't wait til next week! School starts and hopefully things will be calm during the day! lol!"

"event","Well, I don't have much time since I'm leaving in 1/2 hour to go walk, but I'll try to get some of it down. 

This weekend went really good! I was so happy to get away from home. I cleaned my house and did all the laundry so that there wouldn't be a mess to clean up when we got back in addition to all the other mess we'd bring in w/ us. So we left about 6:30 Saturday morning - got a later start that we'd planned. Forgot to turn the a/c off which we didn't notice til we got home, but that's okay. In Livingston we stopped (about 2 hours from home and about 30 minutes from the reservation) at a restaurant for breakfast. Turns out this was the same restaurant we stopped at last year when we were headed to Ohio w/ his family to bury his dad. It was freezing in there and I craved coffee but got hot cocoa instead. We all ate - the boys were pills and grace was very tired and cranky. But we made it thru. Steve messed up the check and ended up giving her about a $7 tip on a $23 meal! lol! Oh well, we probably made her day. But I'm sure she had a mess to clean up after we left. We got the reservation and found out they no longer have any shows or indian stuff anymore! It's awful! They are opening up a casino now. But they still had camp sites so we paid and went and found a good site. Set up camp - the tent was huge! We borrowed it and it had 3 rooms! So the boys had one side, we had the middle and the kitchen/other stuff was on the other side. There were ducks there that apparently are human fed. They begged for food and would come right up to you! They'd wag their tail feathers too and try to take your food from you. Sometimes it was scary. And for most of that day it seemed they made rounds about every hour. Kinda funny. We went swimming and Tony almost drowned! He got away and into a deep area and couldn't swim. He finally made it to the platform he was going for and we didn't realize the trouble he was in until it was over. Very very scary. They had these platforms out in the swimming hole - kinda like piers or something but not attached to the shore. So the kids would swim out there and dive off, or go under and make noises but you couldn't see them. Anyway, Grace loved it. We didn't stay long and went back to make lunch. Then we took naps. It was hot and muggy - though it wasn't as hot as I thought it'd be. Still it was sticky heat. And the bugs were awful. The gnats were really bad, and the honey bees, and there were huge black ants (though they didn't bite)! We went swimming again for a bit and that was fun. We had dinner and cleaned up. Steve had set up two milk crates tied to a tree for sinks. He'd put a trash bag in one so it'd hold water and the other was so the dishes could drain. Also he had a hammock so we all got turns in that! I think he was hoping it would be for him, he was wrong! lol! We played Bible games and took turns asking questions about the Bible. Turns out we don't know very much - lol! At least not as much as we thought we did. We finally got the boys to bed and Steve and I played a memory card game. We listened to Janice Kapp Perry and I got in a really spiritual mood. I started reading the scriptures and also singing to the music. That was the 1st time in a really long tiem that I felt close to Heavenly Father. I feel so jumbled up in my head most of the time - a very busy feeling - even when I'm bored, that I just don't feel the Spirit. I did that night. We finally laid down and eventually Grace fell asleep. I was beginning to think she never would. My problem though is that I get really paranoid at night - being in unfamiliar territory and outdoors. I get freaked out by every sound. Like I'm thinking some mass murderer is behind every tree. I couldn't relax and go to sleep. So I said a prayer. I asked Heavenly Father to watch over us, keep us safe, but most imporantly - to allow me to find some peace so I could get some sleep. And also if anything were to happen, let the Spirit guide my husband. While I slept like crap - you know, the hard ground, hot, bugs, noises, and finally, I had to pee about 15 times that night! lol! Luckily we have a little porta potty that we had - so I didn't have to travel. But the important thing was that once I finally relaxed and had faith that heavenly Father would protect me and help me rest - every time I woke up, I was never afraid. Even more amazing to me was the next day, while hiking, I never felt fear. But I'll explain that in a bit. He answered my prayers though. 

The next morning I woke up and laid there a bit. Steve woke up and we stared at each other and also tried dozing a bit more. Then we heard Tony wake up and wake up Devin. ""Devin! Wake up! We need to wake up Daddy so we can go fishing!"" Steve and I looked at each other and smiled. He got up and cooked breakfast while I stayed there w/ Gracie. The boys got up and got dressed. Finally I got up to join them. They packed up and took the van to the other side of the ""lake"" to go fishing. I say ""lake"" b/c it's very small. Maybe 2 miles all the way around. Anyway I put on some Jeff Goodrich and read in Job until Grace woke up = which was a short amount of time later. She woke and I fed her. while she ate, I worked on a broom. I gathered lots of pine needles and then tied them together, w/ a rubber band and also some string. It was a hand broom. Then when she was done, i went in the tent and started cleaning up and putting things away. then I swept the floor to get all the dirt and pine needles up. Then I cleaned the camp site up a bit, though I didn't do dishes. It's funny, Steve does dishes while we camp and I do them at home. he also cooks while camping and I do it at home. Anyway, once that was done, I packed grace in the stroller w/ a bottle of water and the camera and off we went to go to the other side of the lake. Wow! It was much farther than I thought it'd be! Plus harder. We were near east TX so there were lots of hilly areas - ups and downs. Very hard hiking on someone out of shape - lol! There was an area that was fairly large that is isolated from the any other campers. This is the area that normally I would have gotten very freaked out in. I would have felt very scared and threatened. But instead I felt very peaceful and Grace and I just enjoyed nature. It was nice. FINALLY we found them! They hadn't caught anything and were ready to pack up. I took a few pics then realized that it look like my film was winding so I popped open the back. Big mistake - just exposed all the film. Oh well. We packed up and drove back to camp. Measured it and it was only a mile. It seemed so much farther; I guess I got a workout! lol! 

gotta run now and get ready for my walk w/ Paula. I'll write more later."

"event","Wow - it's been a very very hectic day! I woke up late - so I didn't get the trash out. And I was hoping to finish cleaning the house and *then* deal w/ the house stuff, but it started as soon as I rolled out of bed. Lucky me. I did get the kitchen finished and floor swept and mopped and also the clothes hung up. But I dealt w/ the house stuff all day long. We ended up needing money for closing afterall. The seller was to pay $1698 of closing but b/c of the way they are doing it - as a refinance, he couldn't just give them the money. It had to be given to us and then we gave it to the title company. I still don't think they will take it b/c it has his name on it as who it's from. We'll see. But at closing, I just handed her an envelope - it had my closing costs and the cashier's check from the seller. She never even checked. I'm sure I will hear something on Monday though. It doesn't matter b/c I have a check for that amount if they don't take his - then he will take his to the bank and change the name to ours. So we'll get reimbursed. And technically we don't officially close until the 15th - but that's b/c we have 3 days from signing to back out. So the seller doesn't get his money until the 15th - which means instead of rent being prorated for 10 days, it's 15 (counting the weekend). And right before I went to the bank I remembered our earnest money and didn't know where that fit in - turns out they all forgot about it. So it lowered our closing costs. Good thing *I* remembered! lol! Steve made it back in time. As soon as he got home, we took the kids to mom's; drove to the bank and got the 2 checks; and then drove to the insurance agent to pay our homeowner's insurance for the year and get a receipt. Then we came home and waited on the seller. He met us and we visited for a minute while we resigned the contract for deed - since the original got lost in the mail, on someone's desk or something. Then we went to the title company. After much confusion - we finally got it done. We closed on the house! Yea! I'm so excited - to be $70K in debt - to know this is *our* house - to not have a rent payment anymore - to just have this all behind us! We both are just SO excited! We headed to Walmart afterwards to do our camping shopping but my stomach reminded me I hadn't eaten all day and we were right at Walmart - the only restaurant is Casa Ole or Dairy Queen. SO we did Casa Ole (Casa Ole, Every day, Casa Ole, Fresh Today - anyone else hear that song when you see Casa Ole???). Yuck. Now I remember why we don't eat there. Call mom to let her know we're running late (oh, closing did NOT take 1 hour, it was 2). Went to Wally World and *that* took an hour. Came home, unloaded the van and split up. I went to mom's to get the kids - Devin said she was sad b/c I was late. Turns out she was watching my sister's son (and possibly daughter) shortly after I picked up the kids - so I imagine it's b/c she didn't get a break. I feel so bad. Came back home and started packing. Steve went to Amie's to get the tent, to James's to borrow more camp stuff, to Dwayne's to drop off tools since Steve isn't working for a week! YEA!!!! Then he got started. We're mostly done packing now and he still needs to go back to walmart to get some stuff we forgot. I have no clue what time we're getting up but it's before the sun comes up. And yet Grace is STILL up! Ugh. At least she'll sleep on the way. And it's only 2 hours there. Hopefully from here on out, things won't get so screwed up. I won't post for a few days - we'll be back sometime on Monday. Maybe Monday night I'll get back on. But I'm sure I'll be swamped w/ laundry - luckily the house is pretty clean so I don't have any yucky cleaning to do. Just putting things away and cleaning stuff from camping. Still - I'm sure that will be a lot. I'm really looking forward to getting close to nature. I'm hoping that this trip will bring us a bit closer together as a family, but also help us along spiritually. Steve and I are taking our scriptures and have agreed to have a morning and evening devotional time or scripture reading. We don't do that now, and we really need to. I'm hoping the kids will be receptive to it so when we get back home it won't be so hard maybe to keep up."

"event","What a day. It has been so very busy. We are closing tomorrow but the title people aren't happy. Turns out the seller is backing out of his verbal agreement to pay 3% of selling price at closing. Luckily since he's doing that, he's now responsible for the GFE seller's responsibilities so that is just under the 3%. So we'll only need to come up w/ a couple hundred - maybe. We'll see. 
Steve left for wherever - Magnolia I think. He got a late start b/c of the seller and mortgage fiasco - so he stayed and helped me deal w/ that. Especially since i was having a breakdown. This stress is killing me! 
It's 10:30 or so and Gracie is actually asleep! My kitchen is clean - except the floor. Living room is clean and vacuumed. Clothes need to be hung up and towels folded, but that can be done in the AM. Trash is ready to take out in the AM. I've gotten a lot done. I have a 4 page list of stuff for camping. Actually one page is camping supplies needed; the next page is clothes for everyone (I like to have a list so I know if everything is there for when we leave to come home); 3rd page is food to take list and toys list; and the fourth page is the shopping list. I still have a to do list, but it's separate.

I think Grace is getting sick - she feels warm and she pulls on her ears a bit. So I've started the garlic oil on her. Eww - making the stuff stunk my house up bad! lol! Hopefully she'll be better in the AM.

Well, I talked to mom - so this is a big vent about my sister. Now I think I said before that I had to lie to my sister about mailing out invites just to get her off my back. Well she's been bugging me ever since b/c people haven't gotten them. Anyway, mom said one girl called today about the invites. Wondering when the party was and she hadn't gotten an invite. Well, obviously she knows when the party is b/c she had to talk to sis to get mom's number. And if she hasn't gotten the invite -WAIT ANOTHER DAY!!! She needs a map and mom said that there were maps in the invites. Well, she needs one today - so mom emails her one. Well, my sister gripes that it wasn't as good as mine - though mine had a couple mistakes but I'm supposed to be correcting them. yeah right! I didn't correct nothing - if they can't figure out a houston map - then they don't need to come! It's as detailed as it needs to be to get to mom's! And she keeps inviting more and more people! It started w/ just 25 or so people - including family and kids. Maybe a bit more. Well now it's up to  40+ people!! And she's not helping w/ the expenses at all! It's all *expected* of us! She's guilted us and nagged us into doing this party, and I'm too darn nice to tell her to take a flying leap - b/c I don't want her to associate a bday w/ a family fight (justified or not). But I just think it's horribly rude to expect your family to throw you a party and then nag the whole step of the way - I mean I feel like telling her ""plan it yourself, I'm done!"" And then to expect us to foot the bill the whole way! I can't expect mom to split it w/ me - b/c she's got a big expense recently buying a play fort for the grandkids (*our* kids) to play one. She's on a limited income. But if we were to bring this up to sis, she would just say ""well, *I* didn't ask for a play fort for the kids"" - like she would have had to. I mean it's mom's money to spend how she sees fit - but if we don't do things exactly as sis sees then we're wrong. It's like when dad would loan her money when she and her ex split (father of her daughter) - he'd offer loans to help buy groceries and such. And she has yet to pay him back. Why? B/c she didn't ask initially for the money - so she doesn't consider it a loan. He offered. But she took so she should pay him back. But it's been years. Father's Day: she *invited* Dad out to eat and then expected him to pay his own way. But she doesn't see this as selfish or rude in any way. If we point it out - *then* it's rude. I loaned her $200 to buy her son school clothes and i know she hasn't done that yet. She was griping the other day about not being able to pay rent and daycare costs. Then I find out she's borrowed $50 from mom! She said initially that she could pay me back $50 a paycheck. I wrote on the memo line ""loan - payback $50 ea paycheck"" - I don't know if she saw that or not. but you can bet your bottom that I will take her butt to court if she doesn't pay me back! She said last week or maybe a bit earlier that she expected she could pay me back in full w/ her paycheck on the 10th - but I *HIGHLY* doubt it. I fully expect to never see that money again. It's sad. Luckily we're not living paycheck to paycheck anymore, so while it's a chunk of money, it's not needed at this time. I'm sick of her selfish ways and I'm getting really close to being sick of being related to her. I expect in the near future I will write her off as my sister. It's sad, but I don't want my kids exposed to her ways or to her in general. She's always making fun of my kids anyway - well, except Grace. I mean, you just can't make fun of Grace - she's too darn cute!

Well, I best be getting to bed. I need to get up early and get started on things. Hopefully by noon - I'll know what I need to take to closing - so I know how much I can spend at the store or whether I need transfer from savings or not. Hopefully not. Ooh - I just remembered! B/c we're closing tomorrow, we'll get most of our rent back (since we weren't here the whole month) as well as the $100 that's left from our security deposit! Yea! Money!!! It's about $575 that we'll be getting. WooHoo! Okay, off to bed!"

Anyway. Many, I just got off the phone w/ an orthodontist for the kids. I've called around but it is impossible to get prices! The dentists have to see them first and then determine needs. Of course I want to get the most reasonable but how do I know which one that will be? So I finally just made an appt. The receptionist was funny though. She mentioned the visit and then if braces were needed, etc. I said well my kids won't need braces yet - they are 5 and 7. She said ""Well, this is an orthodontist office"" - duh, like I didn't know who I called! lol! I told her they had seen a dentist and it was recommended they see an orthodonitst. She asked ""why on earth would a 5 and 7 yr old need to see an orthodontist?"" So I said ""one has tongue thrust and the other has too many teeth"". She said ""Ahhhh"" and we made the appt. It's $30 for both (whew!) just for the visual visit. If x-rays are needed, it'll be more and then obviously more for the appliances/work that needs to be done. I'm guessing that Tony is more urgent; b/c Devin still has extra permanent teeth that haven't come in yet. But i could be wrong. They are calling the dentists office for records and possibly the xrays. She did say though that if it was ""bitewings"" they couldn't use those. I figure that's probably what they got though. Oh well. We'll take this one day at a time. Luckily I have plenty of time to fret about it - the appt isn't until Sept 21! I could have gotten them in a couple weeks earlier,but the 21st was the one that had an appt *after* school let out. So the kids won't need to miss a day. 
The mortgage company overnighted a form and it got here at 7AM. I stumbled out of bed when the doorbell went off. Took 2 steps before I realized my whole left leg was numb. I felt like igor in Frankenstein - dragging my leg as I stumbled to the door. It was sad. If I looked up and took a step, my foot would drag, but I wouldn't realize it didn't land right until I stepped on it. Of course, I would step on the TOP of my foot! OUCH! I was terrified I was going to break my foot or ankle - but I was determined to get to the door before they rang the bell again. I did not want the kids to wake up yet!  Blast it! Why is my bedroom at the back of the house?! OH and on the way, I'm wondering how I'm going to sign for something w/out letting the delivery person realize I'm half naked! So I get there and open the door and the envelope is on the ground! I didnt' need to sign for it - yea! But now I had to reach out to get it - exposing any neighbors that might be peeking to my scantily clad body. I thnk stumbled to the desk - office is right next to the front door. At this point the pins and needles started on the leg. Oh that is awful! You have to just sit there (or in my case, stand there) and take it b/c even tensing a muscle causes it to get worse! Oh the agony! Finally it stops and I stumble off to bed. I was still very very tired since I didn't get to bed til 2AM. 
So I'm sleeping again and then Grace wakes up. Ugh, my eyes are too blurred to see the alarm clock, plus it sits in the windowsill so the sunshine behind it makes it really hard to read anyway. So I'm trying to ignore Gracie - all the while she is kicking me. She keeps calling the boys, but she has that sleepy voice and it's not very loud - so they don't hear. I'm trying to justify having the boys come get her while I stay in bed! lol! Then the phone rings. Of course the cordless is right next to the non-cordless - in the office. Luckily this time my legs weren't asleep. lol! I miss the call - 3 rings and it goes to call notes. Darn - it was unavailable which is probably Greg. So I call him and it was - he needs a good number for Steve's boss. They need to verify employment - the day before closing to make sure he hasn't lost his job. But they can't get anyone except one person who, they thought was Esther, but wasn't; and she couldn't do it. So I call Steve and get the numbers, call Greg and Verena and give the numbers. Steve calls Esther and Don and tell them to expect calls from the loan company. Just found out they have verified employment. Yea! And Greg told Steve closing is definitely tomorrow! Yea! Now of course I just gotta call the title company to verify. I'm scared to call and get bad news! lol! 
But while talking w/ Steve, I find out that for him to do closing tomorrow he will have to get a hotel room and work this evenign and first thing in the AM. He's got to go to magnolia, I think, for a rig and rig inspections can take lots of time. So if he goes tonight - or this afternoon and does about 1/2 of it, then sleeps in a hotel, then finishes in the AM, he'll be home w/ plenty of time for closing. No rushing involved. SO I get to spend the night away from dh. I hate that part of the job. Oh well, it means we get to close tomorrow! We'll officially be homeowners! Yea!
Oh, and my new friend Michelle wants to meet tomorrow! I'm not sure I'll be able to - depending on closing; but it's so fun to have friends! And we just might go to Hobby Lobby soon - I've been looking for an excuse to go - tee hee!
My sister called - it's been a busy morning! She wanted to know if Steve was going to Mom's tonight, but I said I doubted it w/ work. I just called her back to tell her no. But she got in my business about walking (which I did last night - 2.5 miles!). She wants to go w/ us! That is *my* time! I don't want to spend it w/ her! Good news is we go late - when it's dark, so she says that's too late. But I said if she wanted to go on the days I didn't go w/ Paula and Amie, then let me know, b/c I need to do it more often. She's getting ready for a juvenile diabetes walk - and she needs to get in shape. I told her we power walk though. She jsut wants to walk. We book it! We'll leave her in our dust! lol! 
Well, I'd better get back to chores and making lunch for the kids. They are bugging me about it. What to make, what to make?
Hope the rest of my day is slow and uneventful!"

"event","what a day. NOT! I have felt yucky all day. Headachy and just blech. So I cleaned a bit and made lunch for the boys. Watched Recess w/ the kids; then I laid down. I wasn't trying to sleep -well, maybe; but luckily Steve got home and he was able to watch the kids while I slept. Man I was freezing for a long time! Then steve came in and said Greg was on the phone. By the time I got off, I was burning up! Now I feel all hot and sticky. 
Good news is that Greg said closing on Friday, barring any complications! (which means, maybe next week since they can't seem to do anything w/o complications! lol). I called the Title company and we aren't on the books. They are waiting on the original contract for deed - which of course the mortgage company has to send to us -overnighting tonight. Then they have to make up a loan or Note and Deed of Trust - since the books show no lein on the property. This is all so confusing. I just can't see the mortgage compnay coming up w/ the Note and Deed of Trust w/o mistakes. we'll see. But it looks like it *could* be this week! Yea! 
I just got a letter from the school about kindergarten orientation. That's next Thursday. And I called the school and the class lists will be up tonight after 5. So, now I'm getting all say b/c my boys start school in a week and a half! I didn't think I would get upset w/ Tony going to K; I mean he went to pre-K every day last year. I thought the emotional was last year. But apparently not. Now I'm all sad that he's growing up. That's just going to leave me and Gracie all day every day while they are at school. I don't know what either one of us will do! Grace adores her brothers and she will be so lost. So, of course, will I since they help me SO much w/ her. One lady at church was talking about starting a play group for SAHMs and wanted to know if I was interested. Of course! But I haven't heard anything. Then again, I didn't go to church last week and won't be there this week either. Maybe.
Now I'm trying to talk Steve out of camping. First I tried telling him that me and Gracie were going to just stay here b/c I'm not getting into all that much right now. And he of course doesn't want to do this just w/ the boys. He said, it would be different if it was just overnight. But he wants to do something as a family. This is the cheapest vacation we know of right now. But it's just so blasted hot! People are dying all over b/c of heat; I don't want one of  my kids to get heat stroke, you know? I worry mostly about Gracie. Dont' get me wrong, I don't want to stay here b/c I'll just end up bored and depressed. But I just don't think I'll be able to take the heat. So we're debating about that. Maybe leave Saturday AM - but it'd have to be really really early so by the time we get there, it's not super hot already, b/c we have to set up camp. Stay all day Saturday and Sunday and leave Monday AM or early afternoon. Devin has karate Monday night and I don't want him to miss that since he really needs one more sparring class before the tournament. 
Becca! i just thought of something - Next Wednesday I probably could come down to Clute b/c we don't have young women activity. They are going to Temple on Tuesday; so no activity on Wednesday. And I read your post and saw that Institute is Tuesdays. Are you free that night? I think it's the 15th. 
We'll see."

"event","So I didn't get to walk and I'm bummed about that. Paula had to teach a class tonight at church and said she thought she'd be done by 8 and would meet me there around 8:30 but would call first. Well I left at 8:30 to get there (needed out of the house) and read the paper while I waited. Lots of non-interesting things happening in my town. I called her husband and he gave me her cell #. I called that but just got a voice mail recording - it was an automated recording so it wasn't her and I wasn't even sure if I had the right number. Anyways, tried again at 9 and finally came home. At 9:15, she calls and said she totally lost track of time. Turns out it was her number, but she can't pick up voice mail so the message was a waste! lol! Oh well, hopefully we'll go tomorrow.
But I'm just so depressed. It's weird - at teh counselor, I didn't feel depressed. Just so very exhausted. But I said that for a few days I hadn't really felt sad or what I would call depressed. She said the tiredness and sleep disturbances are signs of depression. I know that but it took a bit to get across to her that when I say I feel depressed - I'm meaning more emotional feelings. Like sadness. But by the time I left I was on my way to being depressed. The session stirred up feelings of inadequacy about my parenting skills; my frustrations w/ my sister and then seeing her at mom's just made it worse. Steve is awesome and is so supportive but I just feel so alone right now. Even w/ him sitting beside me, or like when he laid on the bed next to me when I came back from not walking. We talk and interact, but I feel so very very alone. 
I've been thinking of something too that bugs me. I'm part of several groups on the internet - message boards as well as email groups. And most of those groups know so much about me b/c it's so easy for me to ask for help or tell about myself and/or problems/experiences (why is it so darn difficult IRL?). But I realized that I know very very little about other people. I wonder if it's a bipolar thing, or just me. But I seem to share everything about myself in an attempt (maybe?) to connect w/ other people so I feel less alone. But in a way it makes me feel like I'm weak - always asking for help. I wonder what others think of me, yet I know I shouldn't care. But I do! I don't want people thinking I'm wishy washy or self absorbed or judgemental or whatever. I dont' mind peopel thinking I'm weird - b/c I know I am! lol! But I do care what others think. I worry I'll freak people out and then they'll not want to be around me anymore. I hate my self doubt I always carry w/ me. 
More bad news - Tony is still sick. Poor guy. I'm going to have to break down and take the bugger to the doctor. Turns out I wasn't using the garlic oil right and so he wasn't getting enough. Now it's pretty bad. I just hate his doctor. She's just weird and I don't feel really listens at all. I hate insurance sometimes but it's nearly impossible w/o insurance to get them medical care when they do need it. Oh well, I'm off to try to go to bed. I'm hoping Steve will offer to stay up w/ grace while I go to bed. i don't want to ask b/c he's worked hard all day; but if he offers I'll take him up on it. Luckily I don't have anything to do tomorrow! So I can rest. hopefully. Oh, and clean. Darn it - some mosquitos got in and I'm getting eaten alive!"

Unfortunately Tony got sick again on the way and Ididn't have any meds. His fever came back, his ears started hurting again and now his head was hurting. Mom gave him some herbal stuff - but it *stank*!! lol! Went to the dentist; they were supposed to schedule both boys at the same time, but they didn't. SO Devin was back there for almost an hour and then it was TOny's turn. No cavities - good news, right? Well, yeah, but both are going to require TONS of orthodontic work. Tony has tongue thrust - which means his tongue goes forward and pushes on his teeth when he swallows instead of going up and back (swallow and pay attention to what your tongue does). His baby teeth are already falling out and he's only 5; it's b/c he's wearing them out w/ his tongue. Problem is that as his permanent teeth come in - the tongue is going to keep pushing on them. Instead of having teeth that are straight up and down, they will be forced out - sort of like an over bite. But the dentist said if it got bad enough, it could even require surgery! So he needs an appliance to teach his tongue to work correctly. That's about $500! Then there's Devin. Wonderful Devin. I always knew he was a strange, weird child. Now I have confirmation. That child has extra teeth. And only on one side! So as his permanent teeth all come in, his mouth will be very crowded and he will be, as she put it, an orthodontic nightmare. He also has a cross bite. So it's recommended we see an orthodontist ASAP - for their recommendations. Problem: the insurance doesn't pay for orthodontic work or appliances. So it's all out of pocket. Good thing Steve got that raise I suppose. 
Was running late after the dentist so I had to rush to Blockbuster and buy ""Recess, School's Out"" and take the kids to mom (promised them the movie to watch at mom's). Then rushed to the head shrinker. Luckily I made good time (went a different way and saved TONS of time) so I had about 15 minutes to run thru the drivethru and eat in my car. I ended up griping about my sister almost the whole session so I was still working thru my emotions w/ her. Funny thing is that when I work thru my emotions on things - or people - I don't erally want to deal w/ them for a bit. So who's at mom's this evenign? Yep - my sister. Great. Instead of feeling irritated and grouchy right now, I'm depressed. I hate it. I'm all teary eyed and sad. Another thing we talked about was how I feel about the boys vs how I feel about Grace. I just don't think I love the boys as much as I love Grace and I hate that! I explained my theory - the circumstances surrounding the pregnancies and births and postpartum periods. Grace's was the only stable and somewhat planned baby. She was wanted before we ever got pg - unlike the boys. They both were totally unplanned and unexpected and w/ Tony (on my part) unwanted. I hated him when I was pg w/ him. I bonded w/ him a couple of days after birth; but I was miserably depressed during that time. I feel like lots of things led me to not be as close w/ them. I also nursed Grace for almost a year - where I only bf Devin for 1 or 2 days and Tony for 2 months. I think that also contributed. Anyway, I hate the way I feel lots of times w/ the boys. I ahve to force myself to be affectionate w/ them and patient and not indicate they bug me. I dont' want them to get scarred b/c I'm messed up. I think that depressed me to. I mean I know I have problems and things I need to work on, but to actually vocalize them when someone is looking at you - wow, that's depressing to admit you're screwed up. Life is just so hard.
good news is I go walking, hopefully, in about 1/2 hour - waiting on the phone call right now. 
bad news: still no news on the house. 3 days left in the week! Who wants to bet it won't happen this week?????"

"event","Oh I am SO tired! I hate this crap - I feel ""normal"" one day, or at least not so depressed, or maybe even up - then the next day I'm dragging butt. I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep for quite awhile, even though I was really sleepy. So when Gracie woke up, I was exhausted. ANd I'm already gripey at my kids. Oh well. I need to head to Walmart or Blockbuster or somewhere and get the new Recess movie I promised my kids - it came out today. Oh but I'm so tired and just do not want to get dressed or deal w/ the world today. 
The boys have dental appts at 1 this afternoon and I got head shrinking at 4. Yippee. Luckily I bonded pretty well w/ my counselor - unlike Devin's counselor. I really don't like her. She's good w/ Devin, but something about her really irks me. 
Hoping to hear something on the house today. I'd better b/c Greg's in trouble if he messes w/ me today! lol! 
Is the music slot for the music you listen to while typing?"

"event","Had an eventful day. The surveyor came out but our neighbor wonders if he was drinking when he did it b/c the flags don't line up! lol! Oh well, it was the very last thing we were waiting on - and Greg says that he should get the ""final docs"" tomorrow AM and we should be ready to close by tomorrow evening (which really means Wednesday b/c Steve needs notice for work). So by mid week we could be done! Finally! I'm so excited! 

Took Devin to counseling - while he was w/ the therapist, I finally finished my sister's birthday invitations. And got them mailed later this evening. Finally! She emailed me 8 times today about this darned party! My sister is so very selfish! She expects us to through her a 30th bday party and she's directing how it's done! She asked if I was going to put up street direction signs for people (the location is on a country road) and i said yes. Well actually I said ""Signs? Geez! We were really hoping they'd get lost and we could keep all the food for ourselves, but it you *really* want people there, we'll put up signs. Sheesh"" - lol! She even offered to put the signs up. I'm thinking I'll take her up on it. I spent $9 on invitations (*then* I thought about doing them on the computer, darn it); about $5 on stamps. Now I've got to get decorations and food and then a present. B/c she'll think I'm rude if I don't get her a present. I just hate her selfishness. It is so amazing that we both grew up in the same home -b/c we are SOOOOO different. So anyway, I lied to her last week about the invitations - told her I'd already mailed them. Finally dropped them at the post office this evening. 
Took Devin to karate. That poor boy - he is so uncoordinated and unconfident (is that a word?). These big girls (I mean big too) would be sparring w/ him and he'd just keep backing away. He finally told the instructer his ankle hurts and he couldn't breath (anxiety attack I think - he has anxiety disorder). The tournament is in 2 weeks! So I told Steve he *really* needs to work w/ him nightly! Hopefully now they will practice spar every night til the tournament. He *really* needs to work on his combos too. I can take him more than once a week, but I don't want to do that b/c it's so far. The other classes are in Freeport, Sweeny and Clute and those are just out of my way. Oh, and I'm thinking of signing up for karate next session. This instructer offers free classes to adults in medicine or police work. I think it would be a great way for me to get in shape. We'll see though.
I got home and Paula called so I got to go walking this evening. That is such a stress reliever for me. We walk 2 miles in a power walk. One mile into it my chest was hurting but that went away. I was hot and sticky when I got home so I hopped in the bath. Of course then Grace wanted to take a bath too. So we bathed together. She is SO cute! I wish I could just bottle up all this funness and cuteness she exhibits. She does this thing where she hides and then peeks and says ""I ee ou"" (I see you) in such a sweet voice! Now she says ""I ee ou too!!"" when we say I see you too back to her. SOOO funnY! She is growing up too fast! I remember when she was a baby and she took her time w/ everything. I was so blessed to have her stay little and babyish for a long time. I cherished every minute thinking that when she started to grow I would be satisfied that I experienced everything. You see, the boys grew SO fast and progressed at amazing rates. They just didn't stay babies for very long. But I was wrong - I miss the baby stages! I miss the night time feedings and snuggles! I miss the times when she just wanted to be held and would look at me w/ such wise eyes. She would be SO content just to have me near! And it never bugged me! I *loved* to hold her ALL the time! When Steve and I went on dates, we both couldn't part w/ her so the boys would go to mom's and Grace would come w/ us! Now she's a handful so it's easier to have her at mom's so we can see a movie or get a nice dinner, but we miss her terribly when we're gone from her! Why dont' I feel this way about the boys? I feel like I love them so much less. But circumstances w/ them were just different. I mean Steve and I were so unstable and both boys were totally unplanned - and not at the best of times eithers. Grace was semi planned and 100% wanted and we were both so thrilled to be pregnant! Our relationship was so much better that I think it was easier to bond w/out all the negative stuff like financial issues or marital issues there too. But I feel like a terrible mom b/c I love my daughter so incredibly much and i just know it's obvious. I don't want my boys to ever think they weren't wanted or we love them less. But it's just different w/ Grace. And I don't know how to make it better for them. Oh well, she's karate chopping me right now! Too funny b/c she makes the little noise too. 
Well, I need to get to bed. I think I said that last night too but it didn't happen until 2AM! 
Oh! We found a tent to borrow for camping so that will save us some money!! yea! 
I have counseling myself tomorrow. I wonder if I should print this journal out for the counselor. She thinks I'm not rapid cycling on days I feel both manic and depressed, she's thinking maybe I have mixed moods?  I don't know, but I *do* know that I'm feeling lots better! Depression is such a bad place to be and I'm doing really good!

"event","I actually got up early this AM to get started on my ""to do"" list. Of course Greg was not at the office when I called the mortgage company so I talked w/ Verena (not sure what she does, but her name was on the papers I got in the mail). After 20 minutes of her jargon (why can't they speak so you understand them?) and my getting very very frustrated that Greg has failed to tell me what this other loan is for - we find out that this was a mistake. That I need to disregard the papers. GRRR! I'm so frustrated! And then the survey that was *supposed* to be done Thursday or Friday last week, was done the AM! I am SOOOOOOO frustrated w/ this whole process! Now, of course, Greg and I are playing phone tag. I'm guessing I was in the garage when he called and then he wasn't at his desk.
But I'm getting a bit accomplished. I've already folded all the towels! Yea! Now I just need to sort laundry and start folding. I just finished washing everything yesterday, but was too lazy to actually sort and fold and hang up. So now I've got a TON of laundry to put away. Lucky me. Aw well, back to the grind"

"event","Well, it's been a pretty uneventful day. I thought my son's ear was getting better, but at the grocery store, it started hurting again. Luckily he went to bed fairly easily. My daughter was asleep by 11 this evening - so that's a good sign. I should be taking advantage of this and getting some sleep - and I will shortly. Let's see, hmm, I don't think anything else happened - except Steve got *my* computer working now! Yea! He began a couple weeks ago when we were given 2 new motherboards. I was upgraded from a Pentium 500 to a 1 gig. But for some reason he kept getting errors and it would lock up or wouldn't load right. FINALLY he figured out what was wrong (I couldn't tell you of course) and now I'm back to my computer! I'm so happy! He had this ""natural"" keyboard - the kind that is split and it took me several days to get used to it. Now I'm back to a tiny keyboard compared to his (my old keyboard wasn't compatible w/ the motherboard, so he had to dig me out one from the garage) and I keep having to hit backspace to correct mistakes! lol! Oh well - I can't gripe too much b/c he put a lot of time into fixing my computer! Now he's working on his! I hope tomorrow is a good day - I have to call the mortgage company 1st thing in the AM - I am SO dreading that. I *never* get any info out of them. I also have to mail the rent check and, oh no! I gotta pay the car insurance that was due today! Oh well, it's only 1 day late. 
Oh, found a neat site that has free homeschool materials - not much, just phonics and math for K-3; so I ordered some. That should be fun! I can't believe that school starts 2 weeks from tomorrow! I still need to go clothes shopping for them (I *hate* uniforms). OOH! I just thought about something - their teacher lists should be up this week! Then on Friday we leave to go camping! I can't wait (well, really I can, lol)! Off to bed now!"

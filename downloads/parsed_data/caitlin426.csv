"event","&nbsp;so halloween is probably my favorite holiday ever. i love it. my costume was not so awesome this yr but it was free so it was good enough i believe.

i quit my job at pier one, it was pretty much a hell hole of retail bs. i got an interview as a nanny and it went well so im hoping she will call me back to work cuz i am brokeeeeeee.


i got advised for next semester and it turns out after spring i only have 3 classes to take. thank god. i was thinking i had to be here an extra year, its a pretty big relief. while the real world is somewhat frightening, being here forever is even more so. im pretty much over being a student its getting old.


my family is coming this weekend for the florida game, i could not be more excited. it should be a good game i expect.






mmmm ok that is all for now."

"event","well i havent written in here in about 3 or 4 months now. sweet. i guess i just forgot. megan ann hook if youre reading this (because i know youve been spending about 5 hours a day on the internet) post an entry, just for old times sakes.


to sum up the past few months of my life:

-didnt have such a great spring semester i was slightly emotionally messed up 

-worked on the beach again this summer and loved it

-got promoted to being a lunch relief/dispatcher. so i spent half of the time in an air conditioned box reading books or talking on my phone. awesomeeeeeeeee.

-realized that just about everyone likes to be a flake

-im over my bestfriend being selfish and all about her boyfriend and proceeded to tell her

-had a few awkward weeks of being in the middle of drama fest. felt like i was back in middle school

-realized that while some people can be fun to hang out with, they can annoy the shit out of me if i spend too much time with them

-made a lifestyle change, i pretty much dont eat fast food or fattening crap anymore and i run every other day or do some sort of activity

-spent about 4 months not talking to someone i loved dearly but at the same time hated immensely...saw him in a bar, made a drunken scene, left...then we talked and met up and tried to&nbsp;talk things out, didnt go so well... just ended up being me telling him what a screw up hes been...but finally we hung out before we left and now things are back on track and may i dare say we are now just friends. probably the best time we've had since highschool, it made me very happy.

-ive gotten to be more spiritual the last few months, i feel like it helps alot. im starting to educate myself more about my religion, which is something i always wanted to do but never did. (dont worry i didnt go gung ho crazy christian or anything)




and for the first time in a long time im beginning to feel ok about myself and my life again, its a good feeling."

you know what i dont like? seeing this crazy ass fundamentalist pastor stand around columbia Bible in hand screaming at people and condeming them to hell. i just get upset and think what are u doing? this is why people think christians are insane, people like this. it really blows my mind how a religion that is based on love gets represented by people like this moron.



you know what else i dont like? when everytime i get on facebook and i see constant religious based status updates. if u dont know what im talking about just check out meredith holberts...""Meredith is seeing the filth of sin and how wretched it really is""

christmas break was alright. nothing great or exciting really happened and i was bored for the most of it. i should of had a job or done something slightly productive. my days consisted of sleeping until 1:00 every day. 

im glad to be back here. my classes this semester are about a million times way more interesting than last. of course im taking a god damn HTML class and im sure ill want to kill myself a couple hundred times during the semester because i hate HTML and everything about it. i really dont give a fuck about how to make a website nor how it will enhance my day to day life in anyway possible which i doubt it will. technology and i for the most part dont get along well. it usually just irratates me. so besides that and european history my classes are awesome...im taking:

-Criminal Justice & Mental Health (i get to learn about serial killers and all their personality disorders)

-Psychology of Human Sexual Behavior (need i explain more?)

-Socy of the Paranormal 

-stupid european history and comp sci 102

-and finally my favorite class, Backpacking. (i get to learn survival skills and how to pitch a tent haha. plus for our final we take a two day trip to the Blue Ridge Mountains of NC...im seriously so excited. ive wanted to go hiking for such a long time!!!)




so hopefully this semester goes well. im expecting it to. besides the fucking freezing cold weather we're having im having a good time so far.


theres a chance for snow tonight...more likely is freezing rain...im hoping for either because that means classes get cancelled!"

its pretty hard to accept the fact that someone who was an important part of your life is nothing but a memory now. 



its even harder to accept it when it was his decision to have it that way.






but i'll never regret this summer."

friday- millers apt= drinking with friends and having a splendid time til the cops came. and i had to hide under kennedys desk. oh yes. luckily lauryn started bawling and they felt bad and ended up just leaving us alone and didnt give any drinking tickets. which is quite good because god knows i dont have 500 bucks to shell out for that crap. besides that happening i had an awesome time and lots of pictures to prove it. most of which are all on facebook, if u arent on facebook then it sucks for you.

saturday- woke up really late. then lauryn still wanted to go river rafting (aka floating down the river on tubes) so i gave in and said ok even though we had a cold front and it was only 70 degrees outside. lovely. so we get there and as soon as my foot hits the water i realize this probably wasnt the smartest idea we'd ever had. we all get in and get used to having our bodies turn numb. for some reason the current wasnt strong so floating down wasnt gonna happen so i suggested moving upstream where the rapid is and play there. if u havent ever floated down a rapid on a tub then youre really missing out. it was pretty fun....what else..dinner at monterreys with lauryn and her brothers. then the fiesta started. i had a wonderful time and it was even better that i could just go crawl back into bed and not have to drive home.



its amazing to me that ive had more fun this past month or so then i have since ive been at school."

my life is really not interesting right now hence the not very frequent posts.


i really love my roomates so much this yr. we all get along really well. its such a nice change and its so nice to always have them to hang out or do random shit with.

we did go to the rocks today and yesterday, which by the way was fun. the cold water felt good since it was so hot outside. and i floated down a rapid. (for everyone who reads this and doesnt go to USC ""the rocks"" is just a river near my house with alot of rocks to lay out on and people kayak and float on tube down it)


so only a few more days til i have internet and cable. i cant wait. me and my roomates have just been watching gilmore girls on dvd everytime we get bored. which is often.

"event","the best summer of my life has come and gone. i cant believe ive already been here a week. its insane.


saying goodbye to levi was probably one of the hardest things ive done in awhile. it was pretty much just a festival of tears. i didnt expect to grow such an attachment to someone i just met only a couple months prior. it makes me sad that its over because i had more fun with him in the past 2 1/2 months than i did in the last 12. some things are meant to be short term i guess. doesnt take away from the fact that i still miss him a great deal and wish that he was here with me. but the memories are here to stay.


im currently sitting in the library due to the fact that we do not have internet or cable yet...lameeeeeeeeeeee. ive changed my classes about a million times and im still not happy with my schedule. i accidentally chose the wrong chem class and went to it tonite and still sat there thru the class hoping that i wasnt wasting my time, but i was. the forensic chem i need wont be offered til spring, god dammit. so now i have an 8am class tomorrow...MY BRAIN DOESNT FUNCTION THIS EARLY. i seriously dont know how im going to do it. god help me.

im going to be working at b&n for a lil while again this semester. i dont really want to but it was just so much easier to walk in there and just have them put me on the schedule than to have to go look for more jobs. oh wells.


i honeslty love my living situation right now. lauryn and liz are living with me and so far so good. we all have similar personalities so i think its going to work out great. im really happy....im hoping for a really good school year.


alright i guess i should meander home now...i hope everyone has a great first week or second week of classes!"

tonite was erins bday dinner, we went to sapporro and usually its fine at the sushi bar minus bad service but whatever. anyway we sat at the part where they cook infront of you and i swear to christ it was probably 105 degrees in the room..im like um why the hell is it so hot and the lady was like its cuz of the grill things but that doesnt make sense cuz takeya isnt like that...who knows, plus the chef was a really big creepy pervert guy. ew. it was quite the experience.

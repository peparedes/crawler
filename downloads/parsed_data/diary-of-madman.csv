"event","Well....Today is the day that I start to plan out whats ahead of me in life, FINALLY gonna be done with this DUI bullshit, or so I think. I cant get ahold of my attorney or probation officer so thats gonna create problems, I still owe $600 that I cant even come close to getting. Yup, today is either gonna be good or is going to suck extremely bad....all depends on if the judge is a dick or not."

"event","Well, I just got back from Dara's, can't say that I had the greatest time in the world, but things will get better. Monday she text messeged me telling her to come pick her up from school because she didnt wanna be there, so I picked her up and we came back to the house and watched american wedding and then went to my room and layed down...had a fun time with her every since, but the school calls her dad today, she gets suspended for a day, and her dad is anything buthappy....we've actually got the blame on her ex boyfriend who her dad dosent like already so now maybe he wont hate me too. I was over there while she was changing clothes and I was downstairs talking to her dad and he told me that he likes me, but if I break his trust then he'll hunt me down and tear the meat off my bones....such a nice guy."

"event","I just got to thinkin about how many times Ive been asked not to come back to Dennys over on 71st street...whenever were bored late at night we just go hang out there and never order anything but coffee and fuck things up. One time I was in there with Brian and he was in the bathroom and called me on my cellphone and told me to bring a syrup container to him so I do and of course, he pissed in it and we sat it back down on the table...they really hated that one....they called the cops, we left pretty quick. We wrote ""FUCK DENNYS"" in ketchup on the table one time and it took up the whole table. Another time we were in there bored and I got them to bring me a pen and some paper so I could draw something..we had a real good picture of someone gettin the waitress in the ass and then Brian hands it to her, yet again they told us not to come back. There was also the time when we tore the baby changer off the wall in the bathroom and flooded the toilet and the baby changer was like floating in water.....and yes, theres more, the news paper machine has been thrown out in the middle of the street before, threw a fork across the resturaunt and landed in someones food. Last night, I went there with zac and harvey, someone taps me on the shoulder and its Chris and some of his friends...havent seen him in quite a while. (he was my best friend for a while then he moved away). So they all ordered food and then walked out without paying and then they tried to make me and Chris pay for everyones food and I wasnt having any part of that, neither was chris, even though it was all planned out, so we ended up getting alot of free food. Told us not to come back unless we plan on having money to pay that ticket with too. Anyways...enough about Dennys, I could write a book about all the hell we've put them through. I seem to have a problem with girls, a few in particular. Dunno how to start this but here goes....Me & Brandy are talkin again I dunno what I said last time I updated so you may know some of this already. Pretty good friends and all now, saturday morning she calls me and asks me if she can take me out to eat so of course I said yes...I like food, We went to Zio's (Italian place), it was good. So after we left there she still wanted to hang out still so we decided to get a movie and ended up gettin 2 (american wedding & boat trip). We came back to the house and layed down in my room and watched American Wedding then it ended and I was real freakin tired and she watched some of national security...some movie that was on tv, but I slept through it a little. We layed all close and stuff...kinda miss that, as much as I dont wanna say that. She asked me if we could at least date and I was like, I dunno...we'll talk about it later. anyways, we watched the other movie and ordered a pizza from papa johns (yeah I know, italian twice in one day)...Didnt really watch a whole lot of the movie, but it was there, I mainly noticed all the boobs in it, other than that it was nothing but 2 guys on a cruise ship with nothing but gay guys. Fell asleep with her there and woke up later on and took her home around 12:30 I think is when we left. I wasnt really that tired after the long car ride there, so I met harvey and zac up at Billiards Palace to play some pool then we left there after we realized how much it sucked and did the Dennys thing and I only slept for like an hour before my dad called and wanted me to meet up at this one resturant to eat breakfast, nice to spend time with him. So, Ive got this situation on my hands now with like...3 girls...4 if ya wanna count mckenzie, I just dont really like her that much, shes a nice girl and all, just not my type. Ya know about Brandy already, Dara...thursday night I was at her house laying with her on the couch watchin tv and she was like tryin to get it on right there...and Crissy meets me at work Friday night wanting to talk about me and her.....to much...way to much, Im thinkin about goin out to the airport by my grandmas house tonight like I used to....not sure that anyone knows about this either so SHHH!!! cant tell anyone or it wont be a secret. But yeah, go out there by the pond and watch planes take off and land...its peaceful, and turn my phone off and just sit and let the time pass, hopefully its not to cold...might sit in the truck and listen to music or something. Oh yeah...JEN!!! (had to get your shoutout in here...dont know much to write about you that everyone doesnt already know so Im going to save myself some time and talk to you instead."

A sickened mind and spirit
The mirror tells me lies
Could I mistake myself for someone
Who lives behind my eyes
Will he escape my soul
Or will he live in me
Is he tryin' to get out or tryin' to enter me

Voices in the darkness
Scream away my mental health
Can I ask a question
To help me save me from myself

Where should I start....well, its so freaking cold here its not even funny, we were supposed to get a little snow during the night...key word, little. Cant trust a weather man.....I was out and about and got freaking stuck twice in the snow. Oh yeah, I got my license back :-)Anyhoo, there ended up bein like 6 or 8 inches of snow and there hasnt been anyone driving on it except me and charlie of course. I got him a job up where I work, he had to work tonight and I didnt (tonight is his first night)and I'd say probly 30 minutes ago he called me and was like, walk to the front of your neighborhood and help me get unstuck, and he was stuck pretty good, and to top it all off, it seems like its 0 degrees out....according to the news its 19 degrees, they're fulla shit if ya ask me. well, enough about my disliking for snow...and Jen, if I could, i'd shovel it all and throw it your way. Earlier in the night when my sleep got interupted for the first time it was birdshit (bridgette) and brandy callin me buggin the crap out of wanting me of all people to drive out to where they're at and see them. I ended up arguing with them and just hung up...havent talked since. :-) thats the way you gotta work girls these days. Im gonna attempt to sleep again and hopefully I dont get phone calls tellin me that I need to get someone unstuck, bye all"

"event","Well, It is that time of the year, yet again to give thanks to everyone....although my list of everyone is rather short this year, just because I really havent gotten along with a whole lot of people as of lately. 

Grandma & Grandpa...wow, great people, anytime Ive ever needed someones help they're always more than willing to help me with anything, even after all this DUI crap they've been really impressed with me as to how I have handled the situation and not drove anyways and always tried to keep a positive attitude, even though you guys were extremely disappointed in me, I would have to say that was one of the most disappointing things about that whole situation Ive gone through. Even though you guys dont read this I love ya to death and whenever I get my license back you will be the first ones I go to visit. :-)

Mom....ya sometimes piss me off but your also always there for me and I appreciate it.

Dad...you are seriously the funniest person I know, we argue once in a while but it happens with the best of them...glad to say that I got a dad like you.

Zac....You as well piss me off sometimes, but hey...thats what brothers are for. Me and you have had some fun times goin out pickin up on girls...lets keep it up....hope everything works out for you and marie. We've gotten to be alot cooler with eachother since I got arrested, thanks man.

Jen....wow, you are truely amazing. Never in my life have I met a girl I can communicate with more...whats it been....2...3 years now? I know you for who you are because well, I havent ever gotten to see you, and I'd love to squeeze you to death and let ya know how much I care about ya...but unfortunatly thats gotta wait a little bit. My own girlfriend pissed was a cunt to you and I wasnt much better that night and you forgave me, one more thing back then that made me realize just how great you really are. Jen, all I can say is, I love you.

yes, there is more friends that I have I just dont feel like writing anymore as of right now. 

HAPPY THANKSGIVING everyone."

So I just took me some tylenol pm because I wanna be asleep, gotta get back into somewhat of a sleep schedule, It would be a good thing. I went and ate breakfast with my dad, his boss and his bosses daughter, she was one of the most attractive girls Ive ever seen believe it or not....tall & skinny, flat stomach and a good face,  I'd have to say I was impressed....not that I had chance with her or anything, but she was really hot.

"event","Well...Last night pissed me off pretty bad, as you can already tell it had something to do with electronics...those fuckers. Charlie called me at like 7:00 pm and told me that he was gonnna stop by for a little bit after he got out of his GED class. So he shows up around 8 and we watch south park for a minute and then Harvey and some chick show up to pick up zac, they were going to play pool for a while so me and Charlie followed along behind them in Charlies car. We went inside for an hour or so then it got pretty boring so we left and stopped by my work and gave zac $20 to go buy me and charlie a 30 pack of beer....we were gonna hook up my car stereo and figured it would help. So we go home and start drinkin and start messin things up....I figured out that you shouldnt try to ground a wire to metal when its hooked up to the battery, it goes boom, and kinda hurts like hell. Anyways, we ended up getting everything hooked up but we needed one fucking screwdriver that was small enough to fit in this one place that I didnt have...and by this time it was pushin 3:30 am so the only place open was walmart and I didnt wanna go there so yet again, its not totally finished. However I wasnt to messed up off all the beer, theres like 3 left and they're out in the back of my truck, Im sure my mom will walk out there and wonder how those got back there, but oh well...I'll blame it on zac if I have to. Anyhoo, Im just sittin at home bored as hell with no potential of anything cool happening, and I just woke up so I dont see myself sleeping. Ah...no license truely does suck balls."

"event","Wow, long time since I've written in here....wonder if anyone will ever read it again, I guess I could make a post and see if it anyone still cares to read. Here I am sitting at home after another hard monday night work, wondering what in the hell to do...it's sad, it really is...I come home from work and take tylenol PM everyday so I can fall asleep because if I dont I die of absolute boredom during the day, and then I sleep the whole evening. Of course, with the sleeping aid I end up sleeping from around 9 a.m. till 9 p.m. . Im writing in this as my mind sits and wonders about life, I honestly dont know what I want, and it pisses me off, because usually I have been content with what Ive got, but I really feel like Im not doing something that I should be doing. I think about things and then Im like, "" Oh, well I am just doing this till I get my license back then I can continue my life how I want"". But now that I look at that, I don't see it changing any when I can drive again, whenever I have free time everyone I know is asleep or at school...it sucks, I like my job alot, I just really despise the hours that I have to work. I can tell this is definitly not what I wanna do for a really long time. Why is it I find myself to be so...unhappy with life? I hate it. I was talking to a friend last night right before work that I havent talked to in a week or so, she asked me, ""Evan, why is it everytime we try to make something happen it never works out""...I honestly dont know, theres nothin wrong with her I guess maybe its just not meant to be. But...I realize that all the girls I go after or that come after me end up being the same way...it really confuses me. The people I talk to around here....Crissy, Dara, Julie, Brandy, Ashley, Amber & Harvey. Break that down and theres 2 of them that I've never done anything with....Harvey of course, and I really dont talk to him as much as I would like, and Amber, how I talk to the least of all. Crissy, Dara, and Ashley...sounds childish but Ive done alot more than just kissed these girls and they're my friends....all my fucking friends it seems like Ive dated, I dont think its a good thing either, they get a boyfriend, I talk to a different girl and the friendship is all messed up. I dont know what to do anymore, my life is the samething over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over....get the picture? I'll lay in bed sometimes with the radio slightly on and fall asleep listening to the words of songs...and god I relate to so many of them its not funny. I need a change...dont know what it will be as of yet, but something is definitly going to change. Ah screw it, im goin to bed for another eternity."

Reasors will let me off work for it, I dont care what they say. Anyhoo...last night was about crazy/scary, went out with Brian, Harvey, and some chick....of course I drank a little more than I should have, but hey, it was my night off. Brian drives like a bat outta hell and just about killed us...I kid you not. here we are going down the highway and I reminded him of the time we cut across the highway really fast....different story, so anyways, hes like, oh yeah, like this! and swerves across the highway..that part wasnt bad, but when your in a swerve at 80 mph and you decide to do a really sharpe turn while in the swerve is never a good thing so we do a 180 on the highway and were stopped in the middle turned sideways....luckily it was at like 4 am so there wernt a whole lot of cars, but just so happens that before we can get moved theres a semi and 2 cars coming, in all 3 lanes, and were taking up 2 lanes...NEVER a good thing, and the semi was in the lane where it woulda hit my door first...also, NOT a good thing. After that I went home because I needed to get some sleep so I could get up and go to work tonight....and here I am, havent slept yet...go me. I called about my dui class I gotta go to and some other thing I gotta go to at 9 this morning and its gonna be like 3 fucking more months till I get my license back, which pisses me off like you wouldnt believe. To top it all off, my grill that I ordered, I got it, but it was the wrong damn thing...so they still havent even picked it up so I can get the right one.......those bastards."

Anyhoo, after that I wasnt tired for some reason....so me, my dad, and my brother went and got the waverunner and went to the lake...put it in the water and went to the storage and got the boat out, put it in the water and off we were....we went to Fun Island and chilled out there most of the day just riding the waverunner around and we cooked some food out there since they have a charcoaler on the island. Ended up being like 34 hours that I had been awake when I finally got home and got a chance to sleep. so moving on a few days to last night, wow. I woke up at 7 pm to Julie and Dara calling me trying to find a way to get liquor so I got in the shower and stuff, I couldnt find anyone to do it since zac is currently in arizona, so I walked in the liquor store myself and got the medium sized bottle of jose cuervo, Julie wanted some parrot bay which I hate, and me, I set sail with captain morgan (spiced rum) a half gallon...had over a gallon between it all...very beautiful site. So the guy doesnt even I.D. me when I try to buy it so off we were. Justin had said something about the presidential suite at this new big ass hotel in tulsa called the rennisance....that room was $800 bucks for the night and they had a room for Justin and tyler....tylers parents got the big one, but Justin and Tylers was still like $250. Julie needed to go see her boyfriend for a while so she dropped me and Dara off there with the liquor and then I start the night off there by losing my phone in the hotel room. Tylers parents ended up going to some bars and stuff so they were gone till like 3 almost so we had both rooms and there was a room full of girls for a birthday party in between the two rooms we had....worked out perfect. So we started drinking and for some reason ordered a really crappy porno on the tv for like $11that nobody even watched...I was gettin pretty drunk so we decided to go to swim...so of course I dont have a bathing suit and everyone else does....dara didnt get in, so tyler and justin get in...me, I was drunk so I just took my pants off and jumped in....in my boxers with a coronita (yes, I did spell it right....my corona had a t in it for some reason). Buncha people in there staring at me...so dara takes one of the keycards outside to wait on Julie because she was coming back and couldnt get in, and we ran out of stuff to drink down there so we were gonna go upstairs...I had a towel on and that was it besides my boxers and Justin and tyler took my clothes up with them and I went outside to wait with dara, couldnt find her. so aparently her and Julie already went to the room, tyler and Justin go to the room and im going around this hotel in a towel now...security guard stops me and wants to see an ID because I had a corona and I was like, my pants are gone! and he starts bitchin about me going around a 5 star hotel in my boxers...wet ones at that....so im up at like the front desk trying to get the guy to give me a key to get in and he wont do it...so im like, well fuck you then, I'll find a way. Luckily Julie and Dara came looking for me. So I get upstairs and those girls start talking about the guy running around the hotel in his boxers and I was like, hey, thats me! anyways, I got my pants on and stuff and next thing I know, im trying to pee in the bathroom and Julie and Dara come in there and take their shirts off....have no idea why.....nothin new since Ive seen it all before....Dara was hangin all over me....I think shes like, trying to get back with me or somethin, not real sure what I think about that. At 1:55 we went to Quick Trip and bought a 30 pack of bud light for those girls. and honestly, thats about the last I remember, my phone was in portugeese when I found it...have no idea what happened, the ringer was different too. So today I have had about the worst hangover....and thats about all im gonna type for now :-)"

While we were at the mall I decided that I needed some more cologne since I was out...so I asked this girl to tell me what smell would attract me to her so I picked that out...""chanel allure"" is what it is...probly butchered that word. Anyhoo....Me,Zac, and Harvey went out to the midnight drags last night with a 30 pack of rolling rock..well,24 pack of cans and 6 bottles since they didnt have a 30 pack of cans....we were on the tower next to the burnouts and we started stacking our beer cans up and made a tower out of them..so at 2:15 they start giving away beers because they cant sell it anymore so we ended up with 38 beers stacked on the tower...the crowd out there even cheered for us when the announcer guy saw it and said something. I do kinda need to get off here though..Amber is comin over in a bit I think and I should probly clean up before she gets here. ~Evan~"

I got up at 3pm and went to work at 10:30 got off at 7 am...went to the lake at 8 am got home at 6 pm, do the math and you'll realize that its a long damn time. My cousin that lives somewhere in Arizona was there camped out, me, her, and my dad got the boat and waverunner and went to fun island out on ft. gibson lake. There was a few topless chicks, wasnt a bad thing at all, even better, only a few fat girls. People are gonna start callin me Consuelo or Eduardo before to very long....the suns doin its thing there, and starting to get my hair blonde from bein out in it so much. It was 103 degrees when we were out there and I forgot sun screen. I got paid today and ended up spending $180 of it so far so that kind of sucks...I should try putting some of it in my bank account, what an idea. Me, Zac, Harvey, Brian, Justin and whoever else wants to go are goin out to the midnight drags this saturday, hopefully Dennis lets me off work to go....if not I may just work extra slow so he'll be forced to do as I say. My mom pissed me off earlier...when I was buying some jeans and went to pay for them, the lady was like, ""are these on sale?"" so of course I said yeah...I think they were $29 and my mom starts sayin something about them bein 70...so she cost me 40 bucks. lets see...I saw Hector today...flipped him off and he followed us for a while, that was intresting. Well, as you can see im starting to ramble on about things, nothin ever happens over here so Im out for now. ~Evan~"

Anyhoo, before all that I got a voice mail from Justin..havent seen him in a while except for tonight, and he got pulled over for goin 88 mph and a 70 mph zone, he had been drinkin had a bottle of vodka in the car, and 2 drunk girls...thats not the best thing to have when you get pulled over. So the cop shines the light in the car, first thing he shines the light on is the vodka bottle of all things, so he makes Justin get out of the car and walk in a straight line and tell him all kinds of bullshit. Thought he was going to jail but somehow managed to only get a speeding ticket, minor in possesion, and transporting an open container....which is alot better than I got when I got pulled over for that. Good thing I had to work tonight because I was gonna go with them...then to a pool party, still havent heard how that went. Played pool for a little bit before I had to go to work at Magoo's. I saw Rachael there, old neighbor from when we lived in Broken Arrow, nice to see her again, she looks 100 times better than she did. After we left there Brian was talking to these girls that blew him off and they slammed the door in his face so he pulled the car behind theirs so they couldnt back out....it was quite funny. So we went and sat up at the Quck Trip everyone turns around at and blared Megadeth and amazingly it attracted girls, and as soon as it did, I had to go to work. ALWAYS works out that way. I saw my ex the other night (danielle), nothing good came from that...Brian also added that he wanted to kick her in the stomach since shes pregnant. Hopefully my Journal gets the whole makeover thing... thanks to Marie :-) I told her I'd give her an entry to herself if she did it for me so I may have to do that pretty soon, it should be way better than Jens journal could ever dream of being. Marie seems to be pretty smart about that kind of stuff so I have confidence that shes the right person to do better than Jen. Thats all I got time to right for now, my dads here and were off to the lake so I can look even more like a mexican. ~Evan~"

"event","well....so far there hasnt been a whole lot happen since last time, I went to work....dropped a can of green beans on chucks head, it was pretty funny...shouldnt have been down by my nuts and it wouldnt have happened. At work when someone is down there by your nuts tryin to fix something and your doin something to the top part of the shelf...they call that nuggin (nut-hugging) and chuck seems to like to do that. My birthday is in 14 days (thats 2 weeks for you florida people) and I got a box in the mail from gillette with a razor and some shaving cream as a birthday present from them for some damn reason, not real sure how they knew it was my birthday, or even how they got my address...but its a good razor so I wont bitch. Just figured out that I gotta work friday and saturday night, which sucks a few nuts. Anyhoo, Im outta here...I need to hop in the shower and go get somethin to eat after that. ~Evan"

"event","Yeah....I had one of these a long time ago but I forgot the password because it had been so long since I had written in it. I decided I'd make one of these to keep me from getting quite so bored, doubt that'll work though....I'll end up gettin lazy and not writting in it. So yeah, for anyone reading this who doesnt know me, My name is Evan, I and I live in boring Oklahoma (someday I'll be outta here). Lets see...more background info, I got kicked outta school last year for having a knife in my truck....long story as to why they searched in the first place, got my GED though. I work at a grocery store stocking from 10:30 pm to 7 am 5 times a week so that keeps me pretty busy. I have a truck, cant drive it right now...stupid me had to go out with some friends and get drunk and decide to drive run from cops...that was a bad night. Get my license back October 1st hopefully, havent been to court yet for it, they were supposed to send me some info in the mail as to when I was supposed to go and they didnt so I get 2 warrants in the mail...had to turn myself in and got a new court date, lawyer was outta town so once again it gets rescheduled to July 29th, 6 days after my birthday (thats July 23rd for all the idiots out in florida). Lets see...girls, they seem to cause all sorts of problems. Dara, been friends with her for like 2 years and she had a boyfriend most of the time, she broke up with him and all so we had a thing goin and ended up doin alot of stuff and of course, she goes outta town and when she gets back, gets back with her boyfriend, and stops talking to me. PISSES ME OFF when that happens, and its happened before. Oh well, enough on girls, I could go on forever with that subject. I do need to take a shower and get ready for work so I'll write more in this later, most likely tomorrow.  ~Evan"

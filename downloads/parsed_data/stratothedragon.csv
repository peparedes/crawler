"event","I havent posted i na long time, mostly because most of the things I need to get off my chest needed to be thoughtfully expressed so my true meaning is expressed. but once again as almost anyone who has ever read my journal before can testify to that I am going to complain about people. Yeah, complain. After all if people didn't complain there would be so much less conversation, I think more than half of all conversations are someone complainin. Anyway. Lets kick it off with a pretty populrar subject ok? People are drama queens. All of us, you, me, all of us, and i get irritated when people think their not. Maybe not all the time, but whenever anyone gets upset they just switch into drama queen mode, and theres nothin we can really do about it so why do we give so many people so much shit for it? because some people do it way more than other people and because they do it for ridiculous reasons sometimes? of course. But its all ridiculous in one way or the other right? or to someone? But hey who cares what other people think right? Everyone does dont give me that. Not all people sure, but everyone cares what someone thinks of them, and if its only one person that would be impressive. And ya know first people complain, and i thinks thats not really a problem, I think its when people blow things out of proportion when things get out of hand and thats when people need told to suck it up. And like I said, everyone does this, chalk another flaw up to human nature. And people are so untrusting. And not without good reason, I'll give us that. People are not trustworthy, but I also think that people need a lot of lessons in the kidns of things people lie about, cause I've heard people not beleive siblings or good friends about htings that they wouldnt lie about, I dont think. And they would think so too I think if they could just step back and ask why would they lie about that? what benefit to them is there? usually none. people are involuntarily honset much mroe than they intend and much more than people realize. I've heard countless people say that people create a lot of there own problems and this can be very true, bt uI dont think it is most of the time. I think its the same as the truth, not many people go out of their way to make other people unhappy, its usually either involuntary or necessary for that person to look out for themselves (also what all people do), thats when people start to blow things out of proportion or refuse to look at the other side of things. Next time you do something or say something, anything ask yourself who could this get back to? cause almost everything is offensive to someone, and then their gonna give you shit for it. But I'm not sayin we should keep our mouths shut, quite the contrary, I think people should speak there minds more, and that other people should just take it with a grain of fuckin salt, cause thats what you have to do with what other people do/say, or ask what the person meant or think of themselves in that persons position. It is important to kow that other people effect you only as much as you let them most of the time, but yes, of coures people can just fuck you up, not all disturbances of ones daily routine are just things your mind creates, thats ridiculous to think. People are not meant to be taken as seriously as most people take them I think. People are ridiculous, so are you, so why do you take them so seriously? Same reason you take them so seriously. Basically we're bored. Without drama, life would be much less entertaining. So next time you get mad cause someone isnt takin you seriously (unless in like, you know REALLY serious situations) ask yourslef, what do you care? If you cant properly communicate yourself to someone else, you think its your fault and you get pissed about it? That makes no sense to me, but hey who am I to tell other people about tempers? About the same,if you ask me, as people gettin 'so sick and tired' of things that are never going to stop happening throughout their entire lives. Learn to deal with it. work around it, whatever, but you cant let yourself get upset about it, or let it piss you off, or however you want to see it, cause your gonna kill yourself, tiny tiny peices at a time. (and dont say anyting like 'well maybe thats what i want' your being DRAMATIC! hahahah, see thought I was rambling didnt you?) One thing I let ya know about is that if you know something and are as smart as a lot of peopel say they are, like i said earlier, dont hold back, say what you got to say, otherwise you might as well not know shit, whatever excuse you wanna give me, your afraid of something. Happens to me too, everyone does (human nature flaw #?? i lost track) I've also heard a lot of people say stuff like peopel arent worth it, if people arent worth it, what is? Some people, certain, specific people, yeah I get that, but how do you know there arent more of those people than you know of? you dont. neither do I though, dont feel bad. People are too untrusting to try and find out, or too afraid. And speakin of fear, whats so damn wrong with bein afraid? I dont think anything, if your not afraid of anything you must lead a boring ass life. I also think people's minds are too black and white, thinking theres no happy medium, like there are only weak and strong or smart and dumb, I am of the firm beleif that this is not true, there are only people who either do or do not live up to their potential, but those who completely dont or compeltely do are few and far between, everyone is in the middle somewhere. Shit, I'm late for work."

"event","No, I don't. But I also know once i get goin I'll write a book if you let me. Hmm, whats new whats new. I dont know, not very much I guess. Nothing exciting in any case. How do I feel. I am kind of bored, with a lot of things in my life, school beinga big one. I'm ready for it to be done in a way that I've never wanted before. It used to just be typical teenage angst, but now I really feel that I am ready to gt on with the rest of my life, althought I plan on keeping it low key for awhile. Actually now that I think about it, I'm pretty mad/upset/not happy with  quite a few things. Big things. Things that I am not going to discuss in my live journal, because that never breeds anything but trouble does it? Inevitably someone I don't want to hear about it is going to hear it, then again, why do I care if people hear the problems I have with them? Easy, I don't. SO why then do I not say everything I would like to say? Like I stated previously, I'm bored. It's boring, its nothing new, new problems maybe with new people, that will probably end up the same, I think this time I would really rather skip it all. I'm gonna wait til it gets to the point of being ridiculous first. And with some of it, it's already there, but I'd rather just, I don't know, see how things play out for a little befor I show my hand I guess. Trick there is, dont wait too long. Suffice to say, I'm not very happy with lots of things. It might be you it might not, you won't find out even if you ask me, not until I feel like telling you. Difficult no? If you've been around me any great length you've heard me say, Timing is everything. I will talk about what I wish to talk about with whom I wish to talk about it with, when I feel the time is ripe. Patience is a virtue my friends. But look on the bright side, I might not even be talking to or about you. So hey don't worry about it."

"event","This was just a little thought that for some reason seeded itself in my brain while I was taking pee break. Why do people date? (Amber this has nothing to do with you) I mean, obviously people date becuse they like each other more than just friends right? I know people who date, but don't like each other much, and I also know people who like each other and never date. Why is that? It has been my experience that people who date, but don't like eac other are either afraid to hurt the other person or don't want to be alone, or are soemtimes afraid of there significant other's reaction. People who like each other but never date is because they never find out about the other person likin them and don't wanna be the first one to say something. Fear of rejection, very understandable. Or if they hear about it they hear from someone else and don't beleive them. Sometimes it can be combined they like each other but one is goin out with a person they don't like. Crazy, no? Why wouldn't people just be straight forward with each toher? Especially people they supposedly care about. But then people date when they don't particularly like eac other sometimes for the, frankly, the sex. So maybe dating is just the thing you do with the person you have sexual relations with? But people also have sexual relations with people they are not dating. Sometimes they care bout the person sometimes not. So that leads me to the conclusion that dating is more than just whoever you have sexual relations with. Also leads me to beleive that sexual relations are just added benefits that tend to come with relationships, lets be honest with ourselves, some action is expected sooner or later, usually sooner. So what is it then? So we don't feel so alone? But we've all got friends, no one's really alone. But everyone craves that special bond with a singular person, yes? at least sometimes. Likewise no one wants to be alone all the time. I hear people say from time to time something about friends before significant others, I refuse to use the more vulgar terms commonly spoken. But if they really think that why do they have significant others? If they care about there 'just friends' more than the S.O.s then why don't they jsut tell there close friends about there deepest darkest things that usually only S.O.s hear about? Because they don't want lots of people to know just maybe one special one? Ok so S.O.s are more important than everyday friends, not to mention everyday friends are usually of the same sex, the closest ones anyway, with yeah I know some exceptions. but those are sisterly and brotherly people who it wouldnt even occur to you to have sex with. SO we're back to sex. So, do we date people becasue we care about them as more than friends, they are of the opposite sex, and to get some? That sounds pretty accurate to me.But as was stated, some people date who don't care about each other very much. That only leaves the other two, and thats back to sex. again. But if those can't be the only two cause i know people that have sex and fool around but don't date.  So why do they have sex? or fool around? there atracted to each other, but don't care enough about them to put forth the effort of being there S.O.? Sure. So who says it isn't in human nature to be mean? thats mean, so screw someone or fool around with them, but not care enough about them to put forth any more effort. But we'll save human nature for another book. Dating. Why? How do we come to the conclusion we want to date someone? What qualifies them? I don't know what qualifies a person for me. Again, lets be honest, we all have pre-requisits. I think, unless judgement is being severely clouded (and it is sometimes, everyone makes mistakes) to qualify a person must at least be agreeable witha person to be there friend. Friends are people with similar interests, people who generally think the same. but we've already made the assesment that a friend is not good enough to be a S.O. But more than that a S.O. should be someone who can offer more than a friend can yes? Companionship, i suppose htat is important to some people on a higher level than others. Never really was for me to be honest. But it cant be true that they must at least qualify for a friend, because sometimes it doens't work that way. Take my girlfriend (this is still not about you, by the way) she loves some bands that I would take nails on a chalk board over. Music is a big thing for me, she likes my music too, but loves hers, but thats not a big deal right? So maybe they don't have to be people you would be friends with. Ya know what I think it is? Honestly, deep down inside every person somewhere? ownership. I've heard guys and girls say that 'he's mine' or 'she's mine' and i remember sayin, no they aren't no person owns another person. But I'm startin to wonderin about that, becasue sometimes it really seems otherwise. One should never let themselves be owned. Everyone is there won person, your already an unwilling and unknowing slave to so many things, in love at least you should be your own responsibility. But I think thats it. I think people like to at least feel like they can actually call someone else their's. their own. Whether to acheive status (sad and pathetic) or for sex (sad and pathetic, more understandable) or becasue they really care about the person, these are all parts of it, especialy the latter is a huge one, but I think part of everyone dating is so they can say 'she's mine' he's mine' It makes people feel like there not a lone i think, not as alone anyway. It also expalins why people get jealous of there S.O. hangin out with other girls or guys sometimes. sensitive of others bein on their territory. Everyone does it sometimes, some much less or more than others, but nonetheless, the good ones just won't make a big deal out of it, or only let it happen once or twice, on strange occasions. But, (of course theres a but) does that mean that if you dont feel territorial even from time to time or occasionally, does that mean you care less about the person? Cause I've heard people say that jsut means your not a jealous asshole, but everyone is a jealous asshole soemtimes, thats how you know they care right? ok, I lost my train of thought so i guess I'm done. Later."

"event","so i don't really have anything to post about again, but i feel like writing. I started going to school at west campus as everyone who reads this journal probably knows and i I love it. Way better than east for me, I feel i made the right choice. I get to see some (and probably most) of my favorite people in the whole world during the day. And I haven't made an enemys yet. It is hard to have good days when people go out of thre way to make sure you have a bad day. This was the case at east with me sometimes. No one does this at west making it much easier to have a good day. The people i talk to at any length are good people so far. getting to see people like heather, danielle, jenny, evan, devin(kinda), matt,rachel, and several others helps my mood a lot. Even if it is just a breif pass in the hallway, it helps me out, I love you all. And as much as I like it, I'm stressed about a class or two, but no bigy so far. I think after this weekend I will be goin on the third week I haven't seen Justine. Christ. fuck that shit. I hate it, it pisses me off, alot. How ghey and inconveinient and all sorts of other bad shit and in no way good. So last week's new comic day was on a thursday. Marvel was supposed to have 6 new books comin out, but only came out with 5. I needed 6. 6 made me hit the 1000 mark. 5 leaves me at 999. How...frustrating. by the way if any of you are interested in the new resident evil movie, it sucks, worse than the first one i think. Aside from a humorous moment here and there. I saw it tonight (alone) which didn't bother me, but i expected much more because people were ravin about it and there were kidsaskin older people to get them tickets outside the theater and shit. Definately not worth the trouble. I started getting cold again. I know I'm sick, but a little before that, in the mornings, mostly. No matter how many layers I wear I shake and shiver like a bag of fuckin ferrets. and about bein sick, it's totally ghey. I take vitamins, I tried sleepin more, I tried sweatin it out. It ain't goin away and I'm tired of havin a sore throat and coffin. ( i know i spelled it wrong). I don't get to get out to the WL much since school started, that also sucks a good deal of ass. I miss it. There was a show the other night though, I didn't even stay for the whole thing and still got my ass rocked off and released a lot of pent up energy and frustration. Good ol' rock. Can always count on Murder of Crows and Johnny B. to rock off various artivles of clothing. In this case my shirt and bandana, which were left in the basement. heh. Well, I'm out. Night, boys and girls."

And the last time I was angry was at work, which did suck, but nothin got destroyed. except a few pizzas which were just re-amde, so no bigy. I don't know what it was. Maybe I just happened to get exceptionally angry a few times in a row and I overreacted about it. Or just read into it too much. I know theres someone out there right now readin this goin ""I fuckin told you you just read into things too much."" yeah well, you told me so. I'm glad you did too. All in all I suppose I am on the right track again. I feel like writing, but I find myself drawing a blank. The few thigns I can think of to right about, I wish to keep to myself for the time being.

"event","so what in the hell is goin on. I just got my computer back yesterday and spent most of the day fixin it before I went to work, and everything was erased off it and it sucks a lot. But that is beside the point of this post. The first sentence was a good start, but I got sidetracked. What in the hell is goin on with me? I don't have a fuckin clue. There has never been a time in my life when I have questioned my sanity more than I have the last few weeks. I think maybe since I went camping with my family not long ago, but it's been worst as of late. I don't know whats wrong with me. I eat less, sleep less than I ever have, which has never been very much, I've always had a bad temper, but lately I've been gettin super pissed off about really really dumb things. Once I'm done bein pissed off I realize this immediately but before hand I get too pissed, too fast, to even think straight. Before I know what I'm doin I'm throwin shit around (big stuff, like, chairs) my basement, and puttin holes in the walls of my garage, and yellin and cursin as loud as I can and bein all around out of control. The things that used to calm me down, don't calm me down anymore, same with sleep. The things that used to make me tired, don't anymore. Read, write, draw, paint, movies, music, runnin, anything, everythin, nothin works. And that in itself is frustratin as hell. When I'm out with friends, I'm havin a great time, but theres this little peice of me that keeps sayin how much I wanna be alone, how much I'd rather be in my room, or jsut at my house by myself. I thought maybe I just needed some time to myself. Thats happened before. But alone time doesn't even do for me what it used to do for me. When I'm alone (usually at peak hours of the morning/mid afternoon) I want to be talking to someone, or be with someone, or for someone to just be around. I can feel my body losing strength and gettin slow, and oof balance, and less coordinated. I fuckin hate bein angry, I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt someone, or myself or somethin. It's outta hand. My parents already think I'm depressed, I've talked about it with a few people, that didn't help a bit. Amoung the few people I've talked to about it, the genereal concsensus seems to be that there is some deep, underlying problem that everything else is stemming from. But you'd think a problem that big would be easily recognizable or identifiable, yes? It would seem not apparently.I don't have any fuckin idea. I've literally sat/layed around for hours thinking about this, and I'm got nothin. Nothings really changed, nothings going so different as it seems like would be aggravating me as much as I am aggravated. Tiny itty-bitty little stupid things fuckin piss me off to the point of being absolutely lived. It doesn't gradually happen, I'm either calm, or screaming. I hate it. I was talkin to someone and they (quite jokingly) told me to kill myself, and I chuckled with them a little, but realized, can you really kill yourself if your not very alive to begin with?"

"event","(isn't it funny to play on words?) I don't have anything to really post about. As usual. I start off a lot of entrys that way don't I? I woke up around 8 o'clock this morning to go work with my father at my aunt cheryl's house in crystal lake. Got home around 1:40. Have to go to work at stucs at 4. What a waste of a day that had infinite potential the night before. But oh well. You have to work sometimes, thats all there is to it. *shrugs* Least I dont have to rely on other people to feed me, cloth me, and all that. Just to shelter me, and we'll see how long that lasts. There is an interesting topic for this insertion, (ew) Relying on people. Can't be too great a thing right? If you rely on people to do things for you for  along time you'll get used to it, then when the time comes to rely on yourself you don't know how to do it or where to start, and wouldn't you feel like kind of an idiot calling up your father or mother or someone every day or so and saying ""what now?"" An easily avoidable situation if you ask me. Not to say everyone who relys on people turns out bad. After all, everyone mst rely on other people from time to time out of necessity. I personally just prefer to not do it until necessary. And I'd be lying if I said that I had no problem asking people for help, I don't usually do it, even when i need help. I'll end up doing so though. I know people who never will. That is also foolish I think. One must realize that no one can do everything, but i see nothing wrong with being absolutely sure you can't do it yourself, before asking for help. But I think people think they are out of options far before they actually are. And ask for help far before they actually need it. Try once or twice, fail once or twice, ask for help cause you obviously can't do it. I always tell people, Try again. I think a lot of people would be surprised what they could accomplish if they only tried a little harder. But then I suppose it really boils down to what a person can and cant do, like Depp says in Pirates. All that matters in life (besides all rules) is what a man can and cant do. how very true. Some people can do more than other people, be it because there smarter, or think differently, or are stronger (in one way or another) or whatever. So, I suppose some people really need to ask for help before some other people. Some people, perhaps, they way they wre raised, there parents sheltered them too much so they don't know how to deal with things as well as someone who;s parents let them find things out for themselves, even if it hurt them? Makes sense to me. I see it being a difficult thing to let your own child get hurt. But I think I would do it. I think i will be under the impression that, as I am now, that it is important that people learn some things for themselves, because it is the only way and/or the best way for them to learn it. (long silent,contemplative pause) My, my I do ever so enjoy stating the obvious for my own benefit dont I? I'll tell me what I'm tired of. People taking things for  granted. Life mostly, and whats it's given to them. I went to (this is for nicole) SeeSaw, last night and it made me start thinkin of this ( great movie by the way) I'm not about to say that everyone has everything and i got shit on, that would be terrible of me. But there are people who, myself included, who have far more than they think they do, or that they see. I know people who think they ave such a hard time all the time and always say they had a bad day, but they have someone who loves them, or cares about them a great deal, and I don't mean family and friends. The boy in the relationship, and i don't mean one in particular (ok, I do, but many more than one) says he has bad days and he has to do shit with his fmaily and work a part time job. But he has a girlfriend, who he can tell anything to, and lay next to in a bed, and kiss, and walk with, and talk o be silent with. That is something I hear and see boys take for granted all the time, the women in there lives. Boys would be less than nothing without girls. But likewise, the girl in the relationship, second guesses things,or mistakes things the boy says for other things, and/or turns his words around/takes them the wrong way/blows things out of proportion. Not to say guys dont do things things, and visa versa for girls with the guy stuff, too. I, personally, would give almost anything to have somene that I could do anything with, and do nothing with, someone i could just lay around with, or walk with, talking or silent, someone i could enjoy a nice day or night with. Or enjoy a not particularly nice day, just because I am with them. Someone to kiss. Someone with which I could argue about things and know it doesn't matter, or that it does matter. But, as I am on the subject of taking things for granted, let us not forget my firends which I know I have and I know they love me just as I love them. And I am infinitely grateful for the ones that are always there for me, or have been as long as I've known them, (heather, danielle, molly, carlie, rachel, matt, john and Co. you guys know who you are) But I know just as well as all of them know, that its a little different. But at the same time, being alone doens't bother me much. Not at the moment at least. Being alone never bothered me much, It gets to me from time to time, it gets to me pretty bad. but never to the point where I crave to have a female by my side. I've always had more self control than that. Which I am a bit proud of. Anyway, the point of this whole thing, the driving force and the underlying message in this post, is that everyone should go and see Saw, (hehe, seesaw, get it?) it's a good movie."

And I realize that many many thoughts could easily fit under this category, but I mean more specifically, have you ever caught yourself thinkin of something, or someone, or somewhere, or some situation, and your sort of caught off guard or surprised what it is your thinking of? I don't very often but I did tonight. Had plenty of time to think about it too, on my walk home from Heather's at 2 AM. It was nice, and comforting I was pleased to find out. When I realized that I was thinking a great deal about what it was that I was thinking about, it turned out it didn't bother me at all, which I don't know why it ever would, despite what it is your thinking of. I can't help the feeling that I may be seting myself up to get hurt, but for now I am quite content and pleased to just turn it over in my head and see how things play out.

"event","well obviously this post is going to be about music, and as usual is more for my benefit than yours, I just need to get some stuff down. I know nothing I will say is anything new to you or to me, I always knew I loved music, and I'm sure you've always known this about yourself as well. I also expect this entry to be rather lengthy, being as I ramble a lot. Now, what is it about music exaclty? I wondered that for a long time and I think I have figured out at least part of it. Music is capable of bringing out your inner most emotions no matter how hard you try to hide them or deny that you even have them. Music shows you who you are and allows you to be most honest with yoruself. And that is always a good thing. It brings out the purset emotions too, which is why they seem so mch more terrific, most feelings are a couple feelins mixed together and are thus not pure and harder for your brain to register. Music lets your brain easily define between feelings so can feelexactly what it is each feeling is supposed to feel like on it's own. This way even when you encounter emotions mixed and jumbled together you can more accurately translate what your feeling, so naturally everyone loves music and listens to diferent music for different feelings and different reactions. Wrestlers listen to heavy music to get them pumped before a match or while they lift weights, some people listen to soft music to sleep, some people listen to certain types of music to help the mexpress feelings they don't even know their trying to express. I've listened to music to make me angry, and to feed my anger until it subsides and to take my anger away, I've listened to music that can (and has) made me cry, for good and bad reasons, whether through a realization about myself or another or a situationm or whatever. Or it's just made me so happy tears are all that come. That admittedly is rare, but I've heard some great music. Some music has brought me close to happy tears because it made me feel so much like someone somewhere felt the same way I did, which is a comforting thing sometimes. No one wants to be alone all the time. Or maybe a song has made clear to me what it is that I'm experiencing or feeling, a feeling unknown to me until I heard it described in a single line, note, chord, whatever. And it's beautiful. It doens't even have to be the words to the song that I adore, sometimes just the sound of it in my head when I'm not paying attention, or the music, or the beat or something. People get the wrong idea about music sometimes, like when an artist gets sued for a kid killin himself or somethin. Thats ridiculous, although suicide is ridiculous anyway, we won't get ito that. It's ridiculous because A). music should be a kid's last ditch effort to not kill themselves, like I said, even if it's a sad song they should find comfort in the fact that someone feels the same way. but maybe thats just me. and B). I really think anyone who listens to any song or cd or whatever and decides thats it its the last straw is seriously misunderstanding the song/artist. But I don't think that happens very often, at least I hope. Music touches your soul, is what it is. And your soul of course is where all your feelings come from. Your sould of course is a very hard hting to be touched, it's not really up to you or anyone whether or not it gets touched, it just happens. But when it happens you know, and you love it and it never lasts as long as you'd like it to and doesnt' come nearly as often as you'd like it to, and it's hard to describe and its hard to remember. I think thats how love should be. Not all the time I mean, constant contact with your sould be be pure bliss and drive a person mad it would be so great, you know what they say too much of a good thing... No, the best moments of love, even if it isn't with a person you are necessarily in love with. It can be with family, friends, loved ones anyone. It's a given that it's best with a loved one if you ask me, but I also think that a passionate kiss is the best way to convey the deepest of emotions. Shit, even sex. Sex is a great way to excercise, convery love, release tension/frustration, have a good time, be dirty, hell its good for a lot of things. I think the soul is like a small animal, it is happy in it's natural habitat, but appreciates bein walked and run around now and then. Sex is a good way to do that I think. How did I get to talkin about sex? Or love? I was talkin about music. It's awesome, I think I've conveyed that message. Anyway, so I got home from camping today, it sucked in case you care, devin bailed on me, what a pussy, he was feelin sick, although well enough to canoe, and at least watch movies and play video games with annie the whole fuckin time he was supposed to come campin with me. What a bitch.  He thinks I'm mad at him? I'm amazed there's any doubt in his fuckin mind I'm mad as hell at him. Thats ok, had he gone with me, I woulda been slowed down through my hikes and runs through the woods. Whether he felt good or not. And hike I did, almost every waking hour I wasn't biking I was hiking, no path through the thorns style. It was awesome. Bluff climbin and all that fun shit. Down to basics it was. Instincts got the go around it was fantastic. But then I ge back home and listen to some music and I got angry and it was sweet, cause it was good, releiving, angry. Liberating angry and I danced around my basement. I have way too much energy to be indoors already, and moving my fingers ain't doin the trick, so I'm gonna rap this up, I hope I didn't forget anything. Later."

"event","So, usually I update if there is something in particular I wish to write about, but there isn't this time. Nothing specific to bitch about, although I always find something don't I? Nothing exceptionally good happened yet, I just felt like updating, felt like writing just for the sake of doing so. And so I don't get tired. For the last, I think, 2 or 2 and a half days I've been functioning on about 4 hours of sleep. Which I think is great, I don't know why, but I like it. I can't say I'm no a morning person, I enjoy mornings quite thoroughly, I just happen to like the night more, so I stay up late and thus, sleep through the morning. But the morning is very different from the rest of the day, maybe just because I'm not used to it. It's a different kind of quite from night, it's not tense, if your up early, you get to watch and hear the world wake up, and thats a very comforting feeling. Probably the most peaceful moment I've had in quite a long time, my only regret being as I had no one to share it with but my dog, which I don't really mind that much at all. The crisp morning air and mist and slight chill I feel and see and smell while sitting on a swing-seat in my backyard is...relaxing. Nothing is wrong in the world during those moments, even if its only 15 minutes. It's beautiful, all solutions are only temporary right? Yeah. My legs hurt, I was running. It got to be about 4:30-ish this morning and I wasn't getting tired so I decided I would go for a run. It was very nice. Very pleasant. I'm out of shape, but the burn in my calves from running on the balls of my feet forthe fist time in however long is a welcome pain. I think I might like mornings and the burn in my legs because it makes it very easy for me to realize and to see how alive I am. Which is of course a good thing for me to realize. I would remain alive if for no other reason than to sit up some mornings and listen to things begin there day. I am currently very aware of my being alive. I like it, I don't know if I feel less alive other times, I don't think I do, I think its just a different part of me being a live at night in particular. That part of me gets to feel alive all the time, and I like it, but it nice to change pace every now and then ya know? I'm also feeling surprisingly optimistic. It doens't matter to me at all right now that things might not work out how I want them to because I am aware that it is just as possible for things to end up exactly how I want them to. I guess I'm just either being very realistic right now or looking on the bright side or something. Truth be told I don't care what I'm being, I feel pretty good. All the people I like, I like them more right now. All the people I don't like right now, I feel no bitterness or hostility towards them. All throughout my life there has been a list of people, short or long, that I felt I could live a good deal of my life with. And lately, I have been more happy and more pleased about that list than I ever have before. It's very encouraging, even if these people would not spend any more time with me than they had to, it wouldn't matter. Right now I want everyone on the planet to know exactly how I feel about them, and I mean that in a good way. I of course want the people I don't like to know exactly how I feel about them too, but that can wait. If someone I cared about called me right now and asked me how I really felt about them, I would be extatic to tell them the devil's honest truth and be very happy and feel releived about it and I'm sure they would be surprised as well, in a good way I hope, I also get the feeling some people would be freaked out and never want to talk to me again, but they'd know, and I'd know they know, so there wouldn't be anything left for it, and it seems like it would be a great weight off my soul. I don't know why I don't feel this way more often. Maybe I should sleep less. I can only hope it lasts. Hold that pose, earth, *click*. There. So someday I can tell myself, ""See? there are times like that, that stuff really happens."" and I'll actually beleive me."

"event","This entry is going to be in sharp contrast with the previous one is the feeling I am getting right now. I am having an awful night. Which under normal cirsumstances would not be the least bit strange, but I was having such a..mediocre day and the night had taken what I had believed to be a turn for the better. I was wrong. I went to see King Arthur, not a bad flick. But as I got home after dropping everyone off and what not, I was still having a decent night, and I think it just got to be that time of the week/month/wahtever, where I start to question myself about every tiny miniscule little thing. My value to people, my contribution to anything and everything I'm involved in, which isn't much I know, what I am doing with myself, or what I could be doing. I know I have said before that I think this journal would be for my own benefit more than for others', but this entry specifically. Everyone has people or a person that they confide in about things they don't tell other people. I am no exception, even if I only have one or two of these people. But presently I don't feel that way. I don't feel confident in confiding in anyone, not fully anyway. Whether out of guilt on myself for confiding in some people about certain things or out of a feeling of being betrayed, even a false sense of betryal. It's moments like these when I feel like I could drop off the face of the earth or choke to death on some food item in my basement and no one would know about it for quite some time. I can't say no one would care, I know some people would care, but I also happen to know that there are some people who wouldn't mind in the least, and may even be better off, whether they admit that or not. But I would be curious as to how long it would take for someone to find out that I was dead. Especially if my parents didn't find me, sometimes days go by and I don't see or talk to anyone else who live in my house.  Sometimes I think the stink would be the first indication they had. And with that said why would I express what it is that is wrong in this thing? Knowing that someone is going to read it? I'm not going to. I don't even really know if anyone is going to read this, does anyone? HELLO?!!?? I didn't think so. I talked about this with myself once, about how I know thre are people who care about me and all that, but they also get so used to me being around that they start to ignore that fact, then when I'm not around anymore they don't notice. Some people call if they need a ride, although I am sure that is never the only case, it's just convenient. SO, instead of me letting slip clues to, or the exact thing I have no one to confide in with, I will tell myself something that bothers me. I tbothers me when I am called to hang out with someone or have plans to hang out with people, and there are more people there than I thought I was hangin out with, or we start hangin out with other people. That is not the part that bothers me unless it happens to be someone I don't like. No, the part that bothers me is when I get suckered in to giving people rides home. We start hangin out and it gets late and I take the people who I had planned to hang out with home and other people are like, hey can I get a ride? How the fuck did they get there in the first place?!??! No you cna't get a fuckin ride! I didn't bring you here, so I don't have to take you anywhere. But do I ever tell them that? NO!! why? cause I'm a lot fuckin nicer to people than I think I should be, which may surprise some of you cause I'm a huge dick. No, I don't tell them to fuck off and hitch-hike cause there friends with my friends, the people I planned on hangin out with. I am very nice to these people and I always tell them what a horses ass I am and they never believe me, whys that? cause they never see me bein a horses ass to anyone cause I don't want the people I care about to think I'm a horses ass. But I am really, I promise. In fact as of right now, I'm not doin it anymore. I'm gonna tell everyone before hand too, I didn't bring you here, I'm not givin you a ride home. I didn't know I was hangin out with you, I'm not givin you a ride home, unless I am informed before hand that I might need to give someone a ride home, then fuck 'em. With few exceptions to this rule. I am sick and fuckin tired of almost everything in this fuckin town and on this fuckin planet. I am pissed off and aggitated and ornery and every other adjective you or webster can think of for bein upset. I hope everyone else has a fuckin bad night too. godamnit..."

"event","Hey everyone remember me? The one who never posts? Yeah thats the one. This time not too much has happened to post upon. Been playin some dodgeball recently. And it's been fantastic. Playin at west's tennis courts, we take up three of them. I'm rated amoung the best of the players we have. And if you know any of the people I play with you'll understand why I am so proud and honored to receive their praise. What is it about dodgeball? I think it's the usage of that killer instinct that circumstances often requires us to hinder. We can just let it loose, like setting a hungry beast on small girls who have just fallen off bikes and scraped their knees. The animal is hungry and smells blood and can probably even se the girl if we let it out close enough. Dodgeball has always been there, why did we need Vince Vaughn to play it first? Oh well, better late than never. Bringing myself into more active companionship with this inner beast is very relieving. I can feel the stress drip off my forehead with the sweat. Nothing to worry about excpet my body giving out, and my health. I think if ever I was to go to war I would come back an adrenaline junky and end up shootin somebody, I'd definately go Rambo on this town. That'd be grat huh? All my old highschool buddys read in a newspaper one day about me goin nuts after comin back from Vietnam 2 and killin a bunch of gas station attendants. Wouldn't really surprise ya would it? Fucker. Anyway, dodgeball, I love it, if you wanna play ask me. I love that feelin of bein a predator chasing down prey and visa-versa. The combination of the idea of fighting for my life and fighting to take another is very very invigorating. I love it. If I was only fightin to kill, and had not much if any threat of bein killed back, it would be much less fun. The thought of inherent danger is exciting. The knowledge of the possibility of a turn of events. And only being the prey is bad for obvious reasons, of course. Dodgeball lets me get rid of all that extra pent up psychopathic energy I have building up all the time, I get let out my anger/craziness, be violent, and not receive a negative sanction (thank you sociology class...)for it. And thats totally rad. I can be mean and nasty and evil and inflict pain with no more reprocutions than what I am directly to blame for (being that if there was reprocutions I would only recieve punishment if I failed to dodge, duck, dive,or dodge.) The last two and a half or so days I been sore and bruised from head to toe, and my feet are covered in blisters (that popped during the second game the next day) and now my feet are bandaged becaus I cut off the dead skin. It's my fight club basically, although that would be cooler and i'd still be a big threat I think.) What else besides dodgeball? Umm, saw the movie, it's funny (fuckin chuck norriss) uh, hangin out, pretty sweet Thrirst Thursdays at the house, girl I like still doesn't like me, and I don't think she ever will, and bitch and moan and yadda yadda yadda, I don't wanna get into that tonight I'm too tired. Plus when it's all said and done I'll still like the girl anyway so it doesn't matter. Um, OH, I guess I have a tendency to ask alot of questions to no one but myself in general, although I do enjoy the responses, and I guess tonight is no exception. Is it wrong to have an all consuming goal or purpose? And of course I do not mean completely consumed but you know. Of course you know, the you I refer to is me. Duh. Anyway, I mean, lets use the wadzinski incident for example. While I was under that frame of mind she was all I thought about most of the day and I wanted to be with her and make her happy and never wanted to be away from her if I could help it and did things for her, and worried about her and all this stupid crap. That mighta actually been the only time I ever had it that bad. It was yeah. And then I stopped all that, and it was totally rad for awhile, but the more time passed the more I was like ok..I'm ready now, just needed a break. Life doesn't give breaks, I find, Dad shoulda told me that one just a little sooner, I think. I posted about this kinda thing once before. Did the couple of things that occupied my mind to that extent but for not as long after that only happen becaus I really wanted them to so I let it happen more easy, or was it real? Thats such a ghey stupid question. *smack* I was there, course it was real does it really matter why? Thats the question I guess.  Does it matter why? Do the intentions of the action change the derisive meaning of the action? Thats an equally, if not more stupid, question, of course it does. Damn I'm either bein really fuckin stupid tonight or very productive. Sorry, definately sidetracked. Question: Bad to have a consuming goal? This, much like the answer to most of my bullshit questions, is half anf half/partially kinda thing. Bad because you may and almost definately will let soemthing good pass you by, and that only doesn't matter if you go the distance and acheive your all consuming goal. Otherwise after you quite your like damn, that totally wasn't worth passin up and I wans't even payin attention. And then all you can say is Oh well, live and learn shit like that. But it'll happen again, flaw of human nature. BUT, it's good because it can distract you or disuade you from much much worse thoughts. Having an all consuming goal, under the assumption it's a good one, can stop one from doing all sorts of nasty things, like drugs, or hurting yourself, or others, or being sad and depressed, and it's a good way to get your shit together. Good luck acheivin your goals wihtout your shit together, if your goal is my kinda goal, which I'm not sure about. SO basically an all consuming goal is ok to have as long as you keep an on everything else still happening around you. I wasnt really much worried about that one to be honest, I'm sorry if I lacked conviction for that rant. Even if it was wrong was I gonna stop? Me? Give up on somthing I want? Stop being a persistant asshole? Are we talkin about the same me here? I'm no quiter. Even if I should be sometimes. NEVER SAY DIE"

"event","Today was unbeleivable. I'll recap the WHOLE thing it was so good, and it's gonna take forever. But I don't care. I woke up at like 6, which was not bad because I wanted to. See wakin up early for school sucks, it's an obligation and nobody like those. wakin up early out of my own free will if dandy. So I wake up, lay in bed half awake, half asleep, half dreaming, half thinking, for about an hour and a half. And it's fantastic, the crisp morning air was refreshing. I was happy, even ever so breifly, One of my favorite quotes goes ""the best things in life are the small, unamed, unrecognized kindnesses of everyday life."" I think this morning was one of those. s0 then mom wakes me up (after clickin on the AC, score)and tells me to get up so I can take her to work, and I do and I took her to work and came home and showered. I usually shower at night, but I discovered in the morning is to my liking as well. After that I drove over to west to see who I could see and I saw miranda and that dumbass guy and jen, and hung out with jen for awhile and saw a lot of my good friends at west. Then I was takin Jen home and we talked and got some ice cream (happy jacks is closed at 9:30 in the morning by the way, but the D.D./31 flavors is open) and I got a banana split with cookies and cream ice cream and chocolate peanut butter ice cream and all the toppings and it was delicious. Then I took Jen home, she's a sweet girl, I like her a lot I think. Then I ran some errands and was very productive. which was good, I got lots done that I wanted to and needed to get done. Then on my way home from that, who do I pull up next to in a turn lane? My pal Veronica. So I go faster than I should down some backroads and follow her to her house and scare the shit out of her with my horn. (car horn, people, car horn) We bullshitted for awhile then her mom conviced me to go out on their wave runner dealy. I was nervous cause I never had been on one before then. Lemme tell ya it's super easy (wasy) and I'm a natural. I loved it. We did it for hours and it was fuckin super rad. I figured out how to turn real sharp, then how to jump off waves from boats, then how much fun it is to stand up, THEN how much fun it is to sharp turn into a wave from a boa while standing up and we ate shit, well water actually, but it too, was super rad. Then we bullshitted awhile longer and I left at what I beleived to be almost 4 o'clock (it was actually only almost 3) so, uhhh, I went home briefly to eat, and then went and got comics, then started to read them but only got through one cause I got a phone call and my friend amanda was like wanna hang out? and I was like alright, so I hung out with them awhile then picked up my mom from work, then got MORE ice cream (I fuckin love ice cream) chocolate chip cookie dough on a sugar cone this time. Then me and amanda came back to my house and she wanted to watch a movie but she fell asleep so I read comics. And ya know what? They kicked fuckin ass. Everyone of them was really really fuckin good. I was especially pleased with the new Ultimate X-men comic I got. They Ultimized APOCOLYPSE!!! I know none of you know what this means, but I was very very excited. Then I watched Enter the Dragon, bruce Lee is my hero (RIP) and halfway through it amanda got picked up and then a little later sarah (weird huh?) molly, and serena stopped by. We hung out for a bit and me and serena got into a little thing, and it threatened to ruin my perfect day then I decided that nothing, especially serena, was worth my wonderful day, but it was all kinda worked out and we hung for a bit and watched the rest of Enter the Dragon. When they left I got online and now the only thing botherin me is an empty belly, which is strange because I've eaten tons of food today, I'm gonna be fat soon I swear it. But it's ok. It was such a good day. Usually summer days are at least half wasted because I don't wake up til noon, but this was very nice. I had stuff to do all day and was occupied all day, it was great. I am very happy and only one thing comes to mind to make the day better, but even without it, the day was good enough to give me more hope and courage for that one thing. Just so everyone knows, I love everyone who contributed to this being a wonderful say. Everyone I saw at west, Jen, Veronica, Molly, Sarah, I love you all more than I already did now, and if it's ok with you I think I will cherish the memory of this day and these people to my last breath. Good days are rare for me, especially ones of this magnitude, so thank you all from teh depths of my soul, because I'm not sure how deep my heart goes, and no matter how far that is, my soul goes deeper anyway. You all helped me to truly appreciate the beauty and magnificense of the world and it's simple pleasures. My hope and zest for life are officially restored. Oh, last thing, thank you to heather too."

"event","Well so much for upsatin more often huh? Face it your talkin to yourself man. I know. It's been a long weekend. Played some four square friday, but not as much and not with as many people as I would have liked to. People told me they'd come, but didn't. Only one person called and said so too. (thanks TJ) Dave left to go to a toga party, understandable yes, but he still made plans for the same day he already had plans for, right in front of me no less. But thats ok too, I've grown accustomed to being ditched. I don't remember the rest of friday really. I know we ended up doing somethin. I think I hung out with devin/annie, sarah, molly, and maybe someone else too. It was a good time. Saturday, worked, hung with devin/annie. Sunday, today, saw Troy, better than Van Hellsing, but that wasn't gonna be hard to accomplish. Then went to work. Sounds like a good weekend aside from the work, no? It wasn't really. I was pissed off and cranky for too much of it. I hate bein pissed off and cranky especially at the same time, which is very very unfortunate because I have an awful temper. I think, actually I'm almost positive it started friday. Even if it started before then, it got it's worst friday. After four square, when dave left all I could do was think about how my friends keep leaving me for something better. Sometimes it's other people, sometimes it's drinkin or drugs or other affairs. But it still sucks either way. If I'm being left for things that are better does that mean I am just really crappy or has everyone found somethin really really awesome? And if everyone has found somethin really awesome how com I can't find somethin or someone really awesome. Or have I found somethin or someone and it/they left because I'm crappy or they already have somethin awesome and don't need/want me? So friday, I came really really close to freakin out. And by freakin out I mean havin a mental breakdown. I sat in my basement with devin and whoever else tryin to decide somethin to do and the fact that I could not think or feel of anyting I had any desire to do drove me insane. I always have a desire to do at least something, even if it is something I cannot do. But I felt nothing. I was hangin out, but wasn't doing anyting for me, I didn't want to read, or write, or draw, or watch a movie, or play a video game or even play four square anymore. I wanted to fuckin cry. But somethin happened and I was saved from oblivion. We started doing somethin, so crisis averted. but it was enough to make me cranky and ornery and mean and nasty the rest of the weekend, most of it anyway. It was the first time in a long time I really felt like dieing. And the first time it's ever happened in front of other people. I'm usually alone. Which brings me to the title of this entry. Confused about it? me too. what do I love? What do I care about? What really matters to me? What is it that makes me who I am? I don't have any idea. I don't think I've truly loved anyone since vicki, if I even really loved her, but we won't get into that. In fact I've never even come close, to be honest. And at first I thought that was great, to continue being honest. I thought not being that tightly connected with another human being again was gonna be like gettin out of jail, a jail with big boobs, yes, but still a jail. I was pretty wrong. The more time that passes the more I wish I cared about someone as much as I had cared about vicki. And I think it is that desire which has made it pretty easy for me to start caring about people. Which is not all a bad thing, but it has cost me. I started liking people much easier than I ever used to just in hopes that I would find someone that I could be with like I was with vicki.., but better of course, I found much better people. I don't know if I was wrong about these people or not. Like Nicole, I started liking her more easily than I had ever allowed myself to like a person before. Was that because of my desire to be with someone, and to care about someone, and to have the thought of them fill my head all the time? or was it just becuase I am attracted to Nicole that much? Either answer would not surprise me really. I think Nicole and I would have gotten along wonderfully, but who knows? I'm no sure why we didn't, but again, who knows? Well thats silly, maybe Nicole knows. But it would be rude to ask. Her motives don't matter, if she doesn't want to be with me than I should/will.do respect her wishes. I don't know if it hurt me more because of my desire about vicki, or if  I got over it more quickly because of that same desire. That is something I will never know, but is also unimportant. Nicole wasn't the only one though. I almost went for a person or two that would have proved to be a huge mistake, but as far as me making mistakes with people I'll say no more. And then Lisa. The only girl I've really liked since Nicole, but I doubt she wants anything to do with with me even more than Nicole. Last, and not least Sarah. I wonder now if she reads this. I imagine she would be quite upset if she is. Again, probably not for the last time, To be perfectly honest I like sarah. I really do, but why I do not like her much much more than I do is beyond me. Maybe she strikes me as more of a friends with benefits? Nothing wrong with that I suppose, but still. I think, to rid myself of the matter, I'll say that she is somewhat... aggrivating, maybe.I don't think thats the word or phrase I was looking for but I don't want to discuss it anymore. Am I drunk? No, I'm just fuckin stupid. Dave broke up with Liz. Is it wrong that I wasn't sad for him? NO. Is that mean? YES. And I don't care. Which brings me to point #2, why is it that suddenly, I don't seem to really care about anything. Not very much anyway, I mean obviously I care about heather and danielle and nicole and lisa and john and a few other people, but really not much. Is it really as suddently as I think it is? or have I always not cared and I am just now realizing it? Sarah says I have no emotions, maybe thats true, outside judges have always had more accurate results about me than I have. It also makes me wonder who can care about a person who has no emotion? or a person who himseld does not care? Ya can't really. But I know for a fact that there are people who care about me, so I must have emotion, but they are also the people that i care about. Some of them anyway. (back to point #1) maybe thats why people keep goin off to better stuff, not cause I suck or cause they found somethin better, but because they think I don't care. Which is understandable because I'm not good at showin that I care, and thats because when I try and show I care it happens to be with people who I accidentally freak out, or they don't like me or whatever. Is it just me or am I the only assertive one? But then asserting myself means freakin somebody out, so can you really blame me for not doing it? Yeah apparently some people can. well if I don't stop now I'm gonna write a novel, so I'll stop and keep the rest to my self. Bitch a lot don't I?"

It was a pretty good weekend, basement show, dance party, hangin with all of, if not most of, my favorite people in the world. I'm thinkin about scrappin this journal. Much like the government did to the first weapon x project. Any and everyone who is against my scrappin of this project should gimme a post and I might keep it up.

"event","Pretty good description of me, don't ya think? been awhile since I posted, like you really care right? been a long weekend, almost too long, I'm dreading school tomorrow, mostly because I am not ready for my mock trial. I didn't do a bunch of shit I was supposed to. Had a close call this weekend with someone dyin, someone who's more like a father to me than my father, but he's not dyin don't worry. My temper got me in some more trouble again, surprise surprise. everyone knows it's one of the hardest things ever to change yourself, damn near impossible actually, and there's only some things that ya can change. Half the time is spent discerning what you can change from what you can't. Then ya gotta figure out how to change them, methods and form. I had it pretty well taken care of quite some time ago, changed myself, a lot of myself, for what I thought was the better, no one else seemed to agree. So that fucked me over, but i figured, hey, if friends don't like the person I am, and I'm happy with who I am, then fuck 'em, right? My friendsshould be happy with me bein happy with who I am. SO I found some people like that, and even managed to repair some old ones, made 'em better ya might even say. But remember those things I was talkin about that ya can't change? temper is one of them. The 'way I am' got someone pissed off at me and also got me askin that old question, 'is it even worth it?' a question I continue to struggle to answer. By the way, everyone who's anyone should see the Punisher movie, it rocks aside from a cheesy line or two. Another thought that breifly and recently occured to me as I walked into my bedroom after a refreshing shower and smelled the warm, moist air, which made it smell cool, and remembered a time when happiness came without effort. When friends were always there, and I was one of the 'group'. It is a time that seems long ago, and I mourned it's death. I love that smell though. I have friends, who love me very much, I know this, but...I wonder if I am the only one who had a period of time in there lives when my entire life and the entire lives of my friends, was each other. They and I had other friends, but they hung out with all of us, we didn't go hang out with another group of friends. Now it seems like everyone has other groups of friends they are with, and I Don't know if I don't belong to any one them, or is it just not my turn yet? Someone told me something tonight that I am not sure how it made me feel, I think I would have been hurt if they hadn't made it sound so true, they said 'I have someting you lack, emotion.'"

I was smart though, in control, I kept my temper in check, and recognized the number of friends he had behind him. I hate when people get in my face about shitty stuff, like me talkin to my buddy who happens to be there girlfriend. I had one little dream with her in it, (in which nothing happened) and I told her about it ( thinking she has the right to know about it) and he flips out. What a cock. If he gets in my face again, friends or not, he's gettin his face worst scarred than i already is. Oh and I got kicked outta physics again today, surprise surprise, argued with that bitch for like 20 minutes too, it was sweet. The weathe was fantastic, and it'll be nicer tomorrow! SCORE! I also get to drive to school tomorrow, thats just gonna be weird, I'll probably ditch and go to west or somethin, heh. I smell like campfire, I love that stink. Well, their askin for me in the adamantium tanks. I'll talk to everyone later."

"event","Well holy hell, was today one for the record books, started out totally fine, got bad quick, got no so bad kinda slow, got bad real quick again, got not so bad pretty slow again but it was alright better late then never right? yeah..sure. Got worse, way worse, didn't get better until way late in the day and after a well earned nap. Then hung out with john and my sister. Total score, better now. Crisis averted. Theres not much else to tell other than I'm awfully nude. Well, you may think it's awful, but I think it's wonderful blissfull naked freedom. Thats what bein in the weapon-x program is all about, nudity. Wolverine was nude the whole damn time, why should I be any different? Maybe it was the nudity that makes him the bets there is at what he does (heh) I want that edge too, so, naked it is. your just jealous cause I'm comfy and your wearing something, HAHA, thats what I say. Whatever, goodnight chickenmonkeys."

But I did get to hang out with devin and that was a blast like it always is, and annie was only there for one of the days we hung out! *gasp* Thats ok though, Annie's cool. I am also ot looking forward to the workin I'm gonna have to be doin a little later today. That'll be ghey too, especially cause I got in an argument with the only co-worker that I actually consider a friend. Great, good job ya jack ass, right? Yeah, I know. Shut up. I'm gonna get the hell outta here while  I have a few hours of freedom left. Later all."

"event","hullo, well, gee wiz here's my brand spankin new live journal that my brosive help me set up. Bought time too. I think this journal will end up bein mostly fer my own benefit than it will for anyone elses, but I still figure it'll be a good way to waste some time and maybe even get some o' the things in my head, out. Which is always good. I doubt if very many  people will even see this, but it is still a comforting thought. I looke forward to reading any and all comments (even if they are all from myself, heh) well, I'm spendin some valuable time with devin and the D, time I don't get much of any more, so I'm gnna go enjoy it. Goodnight for those of you sleepin already, you wusses."

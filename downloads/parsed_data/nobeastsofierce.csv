It's been such a while since I first heard of Straight Time and SO BADLY wanted to see it.

http://kaenhoushaki.livejournal.com/153410.html

March 8 2007 was when I finished the book.
It's been a year since my obsession.

<3

And I'm still so obsessed

In fact.

I want to read it again.
 
yay!

I didn't see the movie until April 4. ON VHS. LAWL."

This isn't in the novel the way the movie shows it.
Dembo does kill Willy...but differently.
In the novel, Dembo shaves his head (to change identity because the cops were able to identify the living robber as 'Maxwell Dembo') and confronts Willy at his home and then in his car. In the movie, Max is mad that Willy left he and Jerry behind. IN THE NOVEL HOWEVER, Max is mad because he thinks Willy told the police his identity (Willy was the only other person who knew about the robbery). After calling him a rat, he shoots Willy in the knee and then again until he dies.
Dembo then takes Willy's dead body off road and pisses on his corpse. BRUTAL.

I kinda like the movie's way better. GIMMIE A BIG BEAR HUG! *BANG*"

<lj-embed id=""15"" />

FIRST OFF:
In the novel, Willy wasn't with Max and Jerry...instead, there was a character named Aaron who tagged along to cut off the police response system. Aaron gets caught and arrested.
SECOND OFF:
The bit about Max taking too long to bag and run didn't exist in the novel at all.
THIRD OFF:
The police do show and there's a bit of a chase, like the movie. Just minus the get-away car bit....because again...Willy wasn't with them. Willy had to take a drug test.

The way Jerry dies, however...that's in the novel just the way the movie shows it."

Best scene in the entire movie, I believe.
Like the novel...Max and Jerry rob a bank. 

Shame Aaron isn't in the movie version. NO RED EITHER. NOR AUGIE. NOR MARY. :C
(It would have been awesome to see Max fucking Mary and the daughter walking in on them in the movie, like the novel version. ""Far out orgasm"" Max says. hahah)"

This part is very different from the book.
First off, it wasn't Willy...it was a character named Augie.
Second off, Dembo allows him to fix...because Augie was looking very ill.
Third off, watching Augie fix made Max crave a taste but not shoot up."

(It may not top my favorite read, <u>No Beast So Fierce</u>, but I loved this book no doubt.)<br />We focus upon three characters - Troy, 'Mad Dog' McCain, and Diesel. All three having troubled pasts and desperate needs, like all of Bunker's criminals. My favorite part was a later scene - when Troy and Diesel mugged the drug dealer, Moon Eyes,&nbsp;and drove off in a stolen vehicle...later being caught by the police. SUCH IRONY.<br />Overall, it's a great crime thriller read~ which is much expected from Edward Bunker anyway!"

I smoked marijuana at twelve (in the '40s) and shot heroin at sixteen. I have no experience with LSD and methedrine. They came to popularity since my imprisonment. I've buggered pretty young boys and feminine homosexuals (but only when locked up away from women). In the idiom of jails, prisons, and gutters (some plush gutters) I'm a motherfucker!

He loved getting an understanding of Bunker and how it was really like to be out of the joint, then taken out into the roughs of society. Hoffman learned and actually remembered a lot from Bunker.<br /></font></div></li><li><div align=""left""><font size=""1"">The scene when Max is with Willy and his family was totally improvised.<br /></font></div></li><li><div align=""left""><font size=""1"">Hoffman based the pull-Earl's-pants-down humiliation off an embarrassing childhood memory he had. A bully had done that to him in front of everyone in the lunch cafeteria, including a girl he had a crush on.<br /></font></div></li><li><div align=""left""><font size=""1"">The scene when Manny doesn't show up with the guns for Max and Jerry was actually based off something Bunker had done the day before that scene was shot. Bunker was talking with someone and had a fight. They decided to use it.<br /></font></div></li><li><div align=""left""><font size=""1"">During the filming of the scene when Max and Jerry rob the jewelry store, another robbery was going on in Beverly Hills...VERY similar to the scene they were acting. Coincidence!<br /></font></div></li><li><div align=""left""><font size=""1"">Hoffman wanted to include a scene in the movie that shows Dembo's last days in prison...being a star in prison, getting messages from a young fellow, having it made!...Then released into society as not a star, but a lowlife...an ""invisible"" being in society. I would have LOVED that scene. <br /></font></div></li><li><div align=""left""><font size=""1"">At the end of the movie- the mug shots were of course old photographs of Hoffman. When Bunker was looking at them, the last photo, Bunker commented, ""...There you are...you could have been one of us."" That bit amused me.<br /></font></div></li></ul>"

It's been shipped already so all I do is wait a bit more.

In the meantime...
Since I posted some German posters, I'll post more from all over that I found. VINTAGE and everything, ofcourse.

You see, the American Poster kinda sucks...

If I wanted a Straight Time poster for my room, I'd rather get a foreign one...they look better. X3

Like this one from Mexico.

<img src=""http://i163.photobucket.com/albums/t293/max_dembo_did_it/STS.jpg"" />

It's got more Dembo. :)

However I really love the French poster. *_*

<img src=""http://i163.photobucket.com/albums/t293/max_dembo_did_it/STF.jpg"" />

OR THE JAPANESE ONE.

<img src=""http://i163.photobucket.com/albums/t293/max_dembo_did_it/STJ.jpg"" />

The Japanese one is my favorite! It's also the most expensive on ebay........ DANG IT.

I guess I'm better off DRAWING my own Straight Time poster. XDDDD
</lj-cut>

I can't wait. SCREEEEENCAPS, GUUHHHHH!
That would mean more Straight Time fanart! :DDDD"

"event","Grandfather died last night. 

I'm staying around to deal with funeral arrangements. After that? It seems that I'll be staying here. I'm the only heir that there is to be found for the Takatori family (not really a family anymore since it's only me, I guess). 

Before he died, grandfather made arrangements for what he considered to be a 'proper' bride to be introduced to me. She isn't anyone spectacular, rather shy, but nice. Nice is something I can deal with. Her family was also really pushing for this union... Her name is Hanako. She knows that this will only be a marriage for convenience, and appearances, mainly because I'm going to follow in my family's footsteps and go into a political career. 

I suppose to a certain extent, this means that Tsukiyiono Omi is being set aside to make room for Takatori Mamoru. With luck, I'll be able to do more good as Mamoru than I ever managed to do as Omi, since it seems that I was never able to protect anyone properly anyway...

I'm sorry.

-Omi.

<i><font size=""-2"">OOC - slightly echoing yannie's opinion; feeling like one is begging for attention isn't fun. a lot of the weird stuff that i did... mainly because i was bored and was looking for interaction.

it almost feels like, if the character isn't boinking someone, they didn't really matter. i guess, i'll just officially move the non-boinking omi and seiki off monitor for the time being so that everyone can get back to their pre-scheduled drama/angst and boinkiness.

"event","A situation has come to my immediate attention regarding the individuals formerly held captive by the organization known as <i>Azure Hoshin</i>. As you may well know, one of Kritiker's agents (see attached data file for <i>Pixie-bob</i>) was formerly one of <i>Azure Hoshin's</i> so called 'pets'. 

It seems that the surviving 'pets' are dying at an alarming rate, even for as group as volatile as this one. Research has been done on this subject, and it has also brought up the fact that the police have been ordered to not investigate any further on these deaths. 

A former <i>Azure Hoshin</i> client (Inoue Yasuo) is currently dating Pixie-bob. This individual is also suspected of murdering four perhaps even five other former <i>Azure Hoshin</i> 'pets'. My own research has shown him to be in the immediate vicinity of the deaths of at least seven others.

Attached are the files with all relavent research regarding this matter.

Permission is requested to take action in proportion to the (direct or indirect) threat against agent Pixie-bob.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Wheeeee!!!"">He didn't have to put that much thought into what he was going to wear to the club, most anything out of the back of the closet would be fine. Black pants with zippers to tighten the legs were pulled on and essentially molded to his thighs. The calves were left loose so he could get his boots on with no problems. They rested low on Omi's hips and the teen grabbed an extra set of bondage straps which were promptly clipped into place. 

Next was the body glitter, because he wanted to be noticed in at least one aspect of his life... Part of him wondered if anyone would notice if he just didn't show up to work tomorrow? Yohji did that aa good deal of the time. Omi pulled out his box of temperary tattoos. A set of <a href=""http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/300W/images3.deviantart.com/i/2005/145/c/8/Tribal_Wing_Design_by_zabador.jpg"" target=""_blank"">angel wings</a> was found. Those were attached to his right shoulder blade. 

While the 'tattoo' was drying, Omi got out his make-up and accented what everyone considered his best feature... his eyes. He gave himself a smoky look and applied a little more glitter to his golden hair. A small almost transparent top was tugged on. Leather cuffs and a collar were perfect accents to his look. 

The blond grabbed his boots and pulled those one once he got to the door. Locking up, he left. 

--

Omi saw Ken and Aya go into the club he'd been thinking about going to. He rolled his eyes and went a block down to a different club. With his luck, they'd probably take one look at him and try to protect him from any potential perverts. Right now, the last thing that he needed or wanted was for anyone to look at him and remember the bright-eyed and smiling flower-shop boy who was eternally polite... Right now, he just wanted to lose himself in the beat of pulsating bodies. 



There were a number of booths and small tables around the edges, but most of the club not actually bar space was taken up by a large dance floor.  A number of bodies were already moving with the music. Omi stayed to the edges of the dance floor nursing his drink. When he'd had most of the beverage, he handed it over to one of the servers and slipped in amongst the dancers. For a time, he danced with a girl that obviously bleached her hair, but quietly moved to another 'partner' when it looked like she wanted to dance a bit more provocatively than he cared for at the moment. Perhaps after another two or three drinks he'd start to consider it, but not at the moment.

Someone bumped him.  A barely heard 'sorry' was tossed over a shoulder. Omi looked to see who had jostled him, and noticed the red tipped hair. Not bad he thought to himself. ""s'okay..."" the small blond tossed back.

The figure turned, long hair, whipping around slightly.  He smiled.  ""Hey.""

""Hey,"" The blond smiled back. Had he seen the guy here before? Omi wracked his memory. No he hadn't... Was that good or bad? It didn't matter. 

The guy was jostled again from behind, barely catching himself before he slammed into the smaller blond.  ""Okay... that's my limit for now.  Want a drink?""

But he'd just had... ""Sure!""

He smiled and led the way out of the crush of people, to an equally crowded bar.  ""This might take a bit... what would you like?  I'll buy this one.""

The teen let himself appreciate his mystery friend's body while being led. ""Smirnoff Ice, Green Apple."" He thought for a moment. Then changed places with the other male, finding the spots that he could fit through and gently nudging enough people out of the way so that they would both fit through to get to the bar.

""All right...""  Once they get a bartender's attention, he orders the Smirnoff and a rum and coke for himself.  ""Booth?  Table?  Lean against the wall?""

""A booth if there's one open."" Omi smiled, and noted the look the bartender gave when he realized who the smirnoff was for.

""Hmmm... hope so.""

""Hope so too."" The drinks were brought over, and Omi didn't make a move to touch his. He just looked up at the bartender with an impassive gaze. The man grabbed the bottle saying that he had better things to do with his time that to cater to some kid's delusions of paranoia. But a new bottle was still produced, which the blond took with an impish smile. 

His companion gave them a weird look but paid the man and then moved away from the bar.  He scanned the area then nodded to one side.  ""over there.""

Nodding, the smaller teen led the way to the recently vacated booth.

""Fweeew... Hi.  My name is Tatsu by the way, never did introduce myself.""

""I'm Omi."" He chuckled. ""Sorry about that... I get a little paranoid about drinks in public places.""

""Ah... well, that's probably a wise practice.""

""It seems to be, except that I end up pissing off bartenders a lot."" Omi grinned.

""They can deal... it's their job after all.""  He took a drink.

""True."" He watched Tatsu as he drank. ""You come here often?""

""Probably once a week.  I like the music here.""

""They do play a decent selection of music. Not like some places that will start to play a track to death.""

""Yeah, nothing ruins a good song faster.""

""So, what do you normally do when not being sexy at this club?""

Tatsu smiled and pulling a band from his pocket, tied his hair back.  ""Go to school mostly.""

""College or High School?""

""College.  I go to Komazawa University.""  He lounged in the seat, playing with his drink.

""Very prestigious."" Omi looked impressed.

Tatsu shrugged.  ""My grandfather went there.  How about you?""

""Me? I work in a flower shop.""

""Well... at least you're making money.  I've got two more years at this level, then some research, a masters, more research and hopefully a doctorate.  THEN, maybe I'll make money.""  He smiled.

""It feels more like I either end up fading into the background or yelling at my co-workers for skipping work because they just 'feel like it'.""

""Oh fun.  I either get the 'you're nobody kid, or oh you're Fuyuki's grandson!'

Omi laughed. ""Consider yourself lucky.""

Tatsu finished off his drink and fished out some ice to crunch.  ""Say that AFTER I've been out on a dig for a month.""

""I think that I'd gladly hand over my problems for those."" The blond winked and worked on his own drink.

""Everyone else problems look preferable, ne?""

Omi nodded. ""The only thing I can say is that I'm not dead yet.""

He toasts the blond with his empty glass.  ""To not being dead!""

The smaller teen raised his half empty bottle. ""Not being dead."" He laughed and took another long drink.

""So... how about you?  Do you come here often?""

""I came in here after I saw a set of my friends walk into the club that I was going to go to."" Omi admitted. ""If there was going to be angst and or drama, I didn't want to be anywhere near it.""

He laughed.  ""I hear you.  My friends were heading for one of those thrasher-industrial places.  NOT my scene.""

""I went to one of those places once... After the first fight, I decided that it wasn't a good place for me to be."" The blond giggled.

""I hear you.  I like to DANCE, not jump around and get into a brawl.""

""And speaking of dancing,"" Omi finished up his drink, ""How about another round on the dance floor?""

""That, sounds like an excellent idea.""

Omi led the way back to the dance-floor and managed to squirm his way through several dancers before finding a patch of floor that wasn't completely occupied. Tatsu grinned and joined him.  ""Mind if I totally invade your personal space?""

""Invade away."" The blonde smiled 'innocently' back.

--

Omi had his arms wrapped around Tatsu by the time the left the club. He was harder than he'd been in a long time... and to tell the truth, he was having a difficult time remembering the last time he'd seen any action that didn't involve his right hand. The small blond nibbled at the other teen's neck. ""where to?"" Even if he hadn't been drinking, Omi's bike was sitting at home, a safety precaution that he'd picked up a while back.

""Hmmm... my apartment, such as it is, isn't far...""  He whispered in Omi's ear.

""my place... is a bit far..."" Omi purred at the whisper. ""yours... it is.""

Tatsu chuckled, a sound that went straight to the blonde's libido.  ""This way.""  They weaved a bit going down the street, joining the throng of young people and displaced tourists. Quite content to be led, Omi continued giving sporadic nips and nuzzles as they went their way. The other young man seemed quite pleased, offering kisses and pets of his own.

""how much further?"" the blond asked breathily while rubbing up against Tatsu.

""next block...""  He seemed to be getting as needy as Omi.

""good,""  Omi purred back.

Tatsu steered them into a small apartment mansion and towards the stairway.  ""Up... two floors...""

The smaller teen pushed other against the wall with a teasing grin. ""so far... so good."" Omi massaged Tatsu's groin through the fabric of his pants for a moment before letting go, his eyes darkening with need. 

The young man's grin widened and he all but dragged Omi up the stairs, down the hall.  He fumbled with keys... but finally got the door unlocked. The entire time that Tatsu was fumbling for the keys, Omi didn't bother to make his life any easier. Reaching between the other youth's legs, the blond slowly massaged his member with an amused smile.

Pushing the door open, he hauled the blond inside and slammed the door behind, locking out of habit.  ""Welcome to my home...""  His eyes glinted and he smirked.

""I want the tour that includes the bed..."" Omi smirked back, his hand straying to his own groin.

Waves to one side of the room.  ""the kitchen.""  Towards the one door, ""the bathroom.""  Straight ahead, ""the livingroom/bedroom... and..."", the corner of the room, ""the bed.""

""So far.. so good."" He stepped up to Tatsu. ""how about we take a closer look at that bed?"" Omi went up on tip toes to reach the other teen's mouth, and started kissing him while his hands explored at that nicely sculpted body.

""hmmm... bed... sure...""  Walks the blond backwards toward the low mattress.

""Then again, there's always the wall."" The blond smiled 'innocently' once again.

""You wanted to see the bed...""  Tumbles them both. A startled yet amusing squeak escaped from Omi when he landed on the bed. Kissing the blonde's neck... ""so... what do you think?""

Omi moaned happily. ""i... like it...""

""good... but I think you're wearing way too much...""

""then what are you going to do about that?"" He grinned mischievously and nudged at Tatsu's crotch with his knee.

""relieve you of... some of them...""

A little more pressure was applied. ""sounds good to me."" Tatsu worked to take clothes off of both of them, pausing for frequent kisses and nips. Omi's small but calloused hands found their way across Tatsu's skin, and slid down his chest. Instead of heading straight for the straining erection, he stroked the quivering thighs with an amused chuckle.

Tatsu groaned.  ""you're evil.""

""only sometimes..."" he chuckled again and sat up so he could take a better look at tonight's lover.

The young man laid back, smirking.  A few pieces of long hair had escaped from the tie and fanned out on the blanket, the tips scarlet.  He had a dancer or swimmer's body; long, slender, with lean muscle.  ""Like what you see?""

""i like it very much..."" 

""hmmm...""  He reached out and felt Omi's arms.  ""What do you do, lift weights or something?""

""something."" Omi smiled and raised an eyebrow. ""condoms?"" 

Waves towards a low cabinet next to the bed.  ""In there.""

It was about now that Omi really wished that he had Nagi's powers. He turned and rummaged in the cabinet for the condoms. No comment was made on the fuzzy cuffs or other meager toys that were stored in there. But the self-warming lube was a pleasant find. 

Meanwhile, a hand wandered over his bare rear and hip, teasingly. Causing Omi to groan encouragingly. ""Which do you prefer?""  His voice was husky.

""either..."" the smaller teen answered, the need palpable in his voice, even though he desperately wanted to just be fucked into the mattress right now.

""surely... you prefer one or the other?""  His words turned silky even as his fingers teased the blond.

He moaned throatily. Legs spread invitingly of their own accord. ""please fuck me...."" Omi panted out.

The bed dipped slightly as Tatsu reached around Omi to grab the lube and a condom.  He was quick but thorough and soon, poised to enter the other teen. The blond pushed back, encouraging the penetration. 

They were both young, and very ready, and with all the teasing and rubbing, neither was going to last long. When Omi came, to say that he was vocal is an understatement. All the stress and tension that he didn't even know he'd been carrying around flowed out of him. Slumping forward, he groaned as Tatsu continued thrusting into him. The young man groaned loudly and came himself, half collapsing on top of the smaller blond.  After a moment, he managed to roll them onto their sides, still joined.

The small blond was barely coherent when he was moved, and fell fast asleep while being held by the other youth. Tatsu did the minimal cleanup necessary and yanked up the extra blanket folded at the bottom of the bed.

--

The next morning, Omi woke at his usual time... the butt-crack of dawn... and groaned at his headache. There was an arm wrapped around his middle, and a warm body at his back. He could feel the other person's 'interest' starting to peak behind him. Under most other circumstances, Omi would want to go for another round, but right now, he wanted a shower, a glass of water, and some aspirin, not necessarily in that order. Omi carefully disengaged himself from his companion and slipped off the bed trying not to wake Tatsu in the process.

Fortunately for Omi's headache, the curtains were heavy, and more importantly, closed.  The small studio apartment was like a dark cave.

Omi shuffled naked across the large room towards the door he vaguely remembered as being the bathroom. His clothes had been quickly gathered up, and one short shower later, the blond was feeling slightly human again. Only his pants were pulled on, but the zippers on the legs were left undone. He was still toweling off his hair when he emerged from the small bathroom. 


He'd haphazardly brushed his teeth with a bit of toothpaste and his fingertip. At least that was better than going around with dragon breath till he got back home. 

Tatsu was still asleep, but had shifted onto his back.  His hair had come completly loose in the night. The blond admired the sight for a moment, then located the aspirin up in the cabinets. He took a couple himself with a full glass of water, and then brought a set over to set near Tatsu before climbing back into the bed himself. The other teen moved a bit, making curious sounds, but settled back down shortly.

Omi curled up and slept for another couple of hours before starting to rouse again. This time when he was waking, he saw Tatsu looking down at him. ""uhm... hi?""

""hey.""

""i'm late for work...""

""Ah... sorry about that.  I don't have any classes today so... I didn't think to set the alarm.""

Omi smiled. ""it's alright... i came back to bed. It'll be interesting to see if anyone notices that I'm this late.""

""Hmmm... thanks for staying.""

The small blond sat up and kissed Tatsu lightly on the cheek. ""Seemed a better alternative than leaving a note.""

He smiled lazily.  ""Yeah, that'd be a touch rude.""

""and now that i'm not rude... i have to get going..."" he snickered. ""though, I did have a good time last night.""

The grin widened.  ""Me too... we'll have to try that again sometime.""

""Preferably sober."" Omi winked. 

Tatsu stretched and then got up to walk Omi to the door.  ""Oh, I don't know... drunken sex is fun.""

""True... but sober sex is when I'd let those fuzzy cuffs come into play."" He grinned. ""and I really have to get going now."" The teen tugged his shirt back on while wrinkling his nose a little in distaste from the sweat of the night before on it. Before he left, he gave the other youth his celphone number.

Tatsu scrawled his on another piece of paper and unlocked the door, locking again behind the blond."

I also hacked into the police servers and had a peek at the reports... plus a little background information. I'm just not going to try and figure this one out. The only explanation that I can come up with is that the police were being paid not to notice the large blinking neon signs pointing to this place.

I also had a look at the payments to the Madoka Detective Agency. Looks like grandfather is starting to get a little desperate for me to procreate. If he wants to shove money at people in hopes that I'll chose someone, let him. 

On a side note... I think that I'll go out and have some fun before Yuuto starts introducing young ladies to me."

"event","Omi walked into the studio where those horrible dolls were made. The master and apprentice were quickly acquainted with the neurotoxin that tipped a set of his darts. The child on the table was already dead. If Omi had come in maybe an hour or two earlier, maybe that would be one less life lost. He was tired of '<i>maybe's</i>'. 

The pliable forms of the two men he was murdering were arranged at a table. One of them smoked. That worked to his advantage. The other thing that worked to his advantage was how the building was constructed. Wearing his mission gloves, Omi located a matchbook from one of the drawers. He lit a match and tucked it into the booklet... dropped it on the table between the two men so they could see what would happen. After all, the toxin he used wasn't lethal, it simply made the voluntary muscle control impossible.

Twenty minutes later, when the place was engulfed in flames, Omi was back in the main building.

The fire would be considered an unfortunate accident. Too bad the materials to create those dolls were mostly flamable. The apprentice should have known better than to smoke while working. It really was a shame that such a rare techinique would be lost forever. But as far as Omi was concerned, a technique that stole lives didn't need to survive even a single generation."

"event","Hey guys, there seems to be an interesting problem that I've been looking into.

Statistically what I'm looking at doesn't make sense for it to be completely random. The former <i>'pets'</i> from Azure Hoshin are dying at a pretty constant rate. After the inicial round of suicides when they were freed, there has been a death on average once a month for the past eight years among those that were considered stable enough to not be sectioned for their own and society's good.

Lately the deaths seem to have become concentrated in the Kanto region. 

I have a list of at least six potential victims (seven if one decides to include Seiki). Three of those six live in Toyko. The remaining ones live within fifty miles of Tokyo.

Anyone interested in helping take out the person/people that has been specifically targeting this group?"

The fact that I'm not fending off any new prospective fiancees is good news. The other good news is that I am most definitely enjoying the use of the archery range here. :)

Also, still not liking the hypnosis in my therapy sessions. Getting Mamoru's fluffy-bunny memories shoved down my throat is not fun. Seriously. I get another memory of happily playing outside with my brothers, and I will start throwing up. There are reasons that I don't like them, and I definitely do not need the cute wuffy feelings of a five year old. lol."

"event","Omi politely ignored his grandfather's guests. He slunk off to the archery range for target practice. The teen was more than mildly annoyed... the impression that he'd been given was that the old goat was sick. Jerk.

There was an assortment of equipment at his disposal on the range. For appearences sake, the boy only used a normal bow. He caught a glimpse of the other guests in a window. The arrow was sunk into the bullseye of his target. It took a little longer for him to reach his <i>happy</i> place while practicing with an unwanted audience. 

That evening he gave noncommital answers to inane questions and remained relatively pleasant to everyone one around him. At least not having to fend off any prospective brides or pushy maids made this visit much better. Even so, the door was locked and a chair pushed up against it before the blond fell asleep that night."

This is a calculated personal assault on me, isn't it? My mind is literally being played with in the shrink's office. At least I'll be able to have fun with the fucking archery targets that they have set up.

I wonder if anyone would be overly annoyed if the old man just kicked it while I am visiting?

... he's probably located some other 'appropriate' female to marry me. What criteria is he using? I can see the want ad now <i>'Please marry my gay grandson. Must be fertile and photogenic.

Already did a session. It was recorded. I have the original, and no copies were made. But I digress... I've come to a few conclusions:

1- Mamoru has/had about as much common sense as a small puppy.
2- My family are even bigger bastards than I originally remembered <small>(maybe because I now have a better context for their dickery?)</small>. Mom and Ouka being the exceptions...
3- It's been far too long since I've been to a club.
4- Reconciling Mamoru's fluffer-nutter memories of his family and my memories of them isn't easy."

Schuldich was also nice enough (or evil enough) to torture Mamoru to bring me back. Unfortunately, he neglected to say whether this is permanent, or if Mamoru will pop back screaming in terror.

The phone was sitting on the charger. He glanced at the computer and noticed that it was on. Picking up the phone, he dialed in Kotarou's number and sat down in front of the computer. Several programs were up and running. Some of this looked pretty serious."

It was large, eloborate and the blond sighed as he attached the ribbon around the vase. He was missing about an inch of ribbon to complete the bow he wanted. The bow was undone and rewound around the spool. 

Omi looked up, and smiled. Yuuto was at the register. So he waited till Yohji's cousin was finished ringing up the current customer. ""Yuuto, I need the spool of crimson that's in the drawer to your..."" he swayed once, then fell, taking with him the floral arrangement that he'd been poking at. 

On the floor, the vase broke sending glass and flowers everywhere. The excess water from the oasis started to soak into Omi's light colored shirt, plastering the material to his skin."

Great. Excuse me while I go leap with joy.


The visit with doctor wasn't much better for me. They did a blood analysis to see what remenant chemicals may still be in my system. Turns out that there are a LOT of frikkin chemicals still floating around in me. Why does this make me want to beat Mamoru if I ever were to have the chance? 

Upside to the funky chemicals is that they are pretty certain that is what is putting the additional stress on my system to keep me as the current personality (why does that sound so weird?). 

Downside... no one is really certain what will happen once everything works it's way out. 

Yohji made noises in the direction about the possibility of perhaps Schuldich being able to fix this situation with me. There's just one itty bitty problem with that idea. There is a little thing known as the fact that we really don't like each other? Something tells me that the fact that I simply BREATHE and am NOT DROOLING offends the man. He doesn't understand that having Schuldich do something of the sort to me would be the equivalent of having Endora perform brainsurgery on Darrin, if she messed up, she would have no qualms about pitching the mutilated and twitching remains straight out the window and then heading over to comfort Yohji... err, Sammantha while saying that <i>sorry, did all I could, it just can't be helped he thinks he's a turnip now.</i>"

Peonies for healing, jasmine for grace and elegance, gladiolus for strength, and freesias for innocence and thoughtfulness.

Note? Omi wondered about that. One of the generic Get-well-soon cards would be best. What name to put on the card, Omi debated on whether or not to have them put Mamoru's name on the arrangement... he decided to just go ahead and put his own. After all, it wasn't a lie, now was it?

He gave his credit card information for payment, and then told them the address to where the flowers would need to be delivered. Delivery time, today? Yes, he was willing to pay a fee for the rush, as long as it looked good.

Apparently someone had told Seike that he was supposed to have bed rest... and damn the man, that bastard was making sure that he GOT the fucking BED REST!!! Humiliating was too weak of a word to describe the means by which Seiki had gotten him up here and into bed. 

More or less after the shop had been cleaned up after closing time, Seiki had picked him up and carried him over his shoulder up to his apartment. Omi wasn't sure whether it was his complaints or just the situation that had brought about the giggles of his teammates. Once up in his apartment, he'd been unceremoniosly dumped on the bed and told to go shower, change into pajamas, and brush his teeth, cause he was going to bed.

Seiki settled himself several feet past the door to Omi's room.

Omi put up a fuss, but eventually got showered, changed into pajamas and brushed teeth. Then he tried working on the computer. The glow from the laptop's screen ended up drawing Seiki's attention to the room, and the laptop was taken away. The bastard even went far enough to walk off with the powercords to his desktop computer!

Reading? He'd gotten chased back to his room like he was a small child.

Mamoru had moved his darts and other equipment, so that meant no knocking Seiki out. Okay, that option was a little exreme. But DAMNIT!!! He was being treated like a little kid!!!!

The blond continued to fuss and quite naturally, sleep eluded him. Omi could see Seiki get up from his spot and walk off for a bit. The man returned with a mug of warm milk and told him to drink it. Omi seethed mentally, he wasn't some colicky baby! He was tempted to chuck the mug at Seiki's head, but then he'd have to clean the mess up. 

Still scowling, Omi drank the milk and gave the mug back. Seiki took the mug, set it on the night table, and maneuvered the small blond so that the boy was laying on his stomach. Next came strong and secure hands kneading the skin of Omi's  back. When he tried to speak, he was gently shushed, and those hands continued to move in soothing motions. Slowly but surely, the blond started to doze off."

"event","He was tired, listles, and wanted to go back to sleep... but every time he laid down, he ended up staring at the ceiling. Omi growled and went to his computer, changed the desktop BACK to the one he normally used and did an online search.

Yohji had said something about a fugue earlier.... So that is where the search started. Several hours later the sun had come up and was shining brightly in the sky and Omi wasn't liking what he was finding. He set his head against the desktop and sighed. 

The land line was picked up. After all, his cellphone had been thrown at that jerk who'd been threatening Oohira Kotarou. Nagi's number was dialed... At the moment, he wanted to talk to someone that wasn't really involved in all the shit he was going through... he wanted to be able to complain for complaining sake. What he wanted right now was a friend."

"event","Sitting in Seiki's apartment playing some action oriented game, Mamoru wondered how Kotarou had liked the get-well-soon arrangement that was made for him. After losing horribly did the blond head outside. The door stayed open so that Seiki could still keep an eye on him.

The phone was pulled out and Mamoru found Kotatou's number. He hesitated. Really, who was <i>he</i> to even be interested in someone as sweet as Kotarou? According to the internet, his own father wasn't a very nice person, and did dishonorable things while in office. That would really be a great topic to open a conversation on... <i>'hi, my dad was a relatively evil polititian, what does your father do?'</i>

Mamoru sighed. There was also the whole 'supposed to carry on the family name' thing as well. His grandfather would insist on his getting married. The blond looked at his phone and pushed the send button. Bringing the phone up to his ear, he could hear the other side ringing."

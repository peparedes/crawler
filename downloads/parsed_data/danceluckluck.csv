"event","Aiight, so Taichou has a booze tolerance like I've never seen! No surprise there though, he always was a little better at holdin' liquor than I was. 
I think I might need to go get Fukutaichou from the living realm. Must prepare my poor head.
Oi Yumi, I don't know what but we should hang out! >:D We haven't seen much of each other lately, and its freaking me out!!"

"event","Ahhh aiight bitches. I ain't got this thing to 'rant', 'bitch' or complain. I'm jumpin' back an' forth from Soul Society back to the living realm, and it gets friggin' tiring trying to keep 'reports' straight. Taichou and Fukutaichou dont care, so really it dont matter much-- guess I dont mind just writing shit down for once, whether it's relevant for a report or not, I'll leave that to Yumichika. SO, yah. Now I'm hungry. Might head back to the living realm to snag me some of them rice balls.."

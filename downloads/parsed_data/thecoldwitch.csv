I messed up again when I tried
You spend all your money and I
And, oh! By the way,
With all you did nothing has changed
So lie like a waste by the side
As everything just falls apart
'Cause everything just fell apart for me

I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my heart

And I don't feel the need to go on
I was happier singing along the way
I had things, I need to say
But now it's like a swallowed tape
That holds up my face from inside
As everything just falls apart
'Cause everything just fell apart for me

So woe is me
Oh woe is me, yeah

I cracked my head and broke my... heart
And the hell of it is what we are
We finish and wish we could start again
Our skin tears away as
Our memories fade with age
And we don't even know 'til it's gone?
But everything just fell apart
'Cause everything just falls apart for me

So woe is me
It all falls apart you see
So woe it me
It all fell apart

I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my heart
Everything just comes down
It falls around me
'Cause, well...
Everything just falls uhhhh

So woe is me
It all falls apart you see
So woe is me
It all fell apart

But I cracked my head and broke my
I cracked my head and broke my
Everything just falls a...

"event","My theory is that girls who are hairy do not have brothers and girls that do have brothers at least trim their feminine area.  I have done limited research and have hypothesized this.  I'd like to do more research, but I'm only one man.

While I can offer no reasoning for this phenomena.  I think it may be because girls with brothers may be better equipped to understand what most guys find desirable.  

So far, the participants in this study have yielded evidence to support this claim.  I must do more research.

"event","So, its the end.  Me and Vick broke up today.  I'm not happy about it, obviously.  Already thinking about what I'm going to miss since I'm not going to be a part of her life.  Even the things I hated don't seem as bad now.  The way she tied her hair back, when she looked so much better with her hair loose. The thing I'll miss most is probably the way I could hold her and her warmth would make all my problems go away.  Her smile was so soothing.  I didn't get to see it often, but that made it all the more special when I did.

I could say I understand her reason, but I really don't.  It was honestly, in my opinion, her unwillingness to try. And I get that. Its scary when you don't think you're gonna have enough time.  But I think if she really, truly loved me, we would be able to work through this.  But, you know what? I'll be alright in time, and I got shit to do too.  I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing, and I'll find someone that actually wants to be with me, and I guess I'm glad she set me free before we got into this any further and she really broke my heart.  At least now I can sleep, knowing that it's over. 

She still wants to be friends, and I do too. But, at the same time, it was a fucked up break up. It was fucked up in the sense that, neither of us did anything wrong.  I'll just need time.

Whether it was, she wasn't willing to try or whether this will make her life simpler.  But, I really hope, I sincerely hope, that this will make her happier and she finds a guy that's so much better then I could ever be, that can be with her whenever she needs him and isn't a half an hour away, because I think that's honestly what she wants. And even though I think she gave up on me, I hope she's happier then she ever could be with me.

And one more thing, I'm fucking back bitches!

"event","You know it's funny how one thing leads to another and you realize what you have is greater then you thought it was before.  I was going to go down to see Vick tonight to surprise her.  Mostly because I really wanted to hug her and tell her that I love her in person because sometimes a phone isn't good enough.  But I couldn't because I'm just too weak.  I couldn't even get into the car. I fell and thank god my dad looked out the door after his shower. How pathetic am I?

But, Vick called me and was very reassuring and it helped a lot.  I never had that, but she always does it.  

Alright, anyway, enough with the sappy shit ... I'll post some rants I've been working on in a few days.

But, for now, I leave you with a song ...

<i>When I see your smile
Tears run down my face I can't replace
And now that I'm stronger I've figured out
How this world turns cold and breaks through my soul
And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven

It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.
Seasons are changing
And waves are crashing
And stars are falling all for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you I'll be the one

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven

Cuz you're my, you're my, my true love, my whole heart
Please don't throw that away
Cuz I'm here for you
Please don't walk away, 
Please tell me you'll stay, stay

Use me as you will
Pull my strings just for a thrill
And I know I'll be ok
Though my skies are turning gray

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven</i>

"event","<center><i>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth.

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same.

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</i></center>




I've been so confused recently, about everything.  My future, my life, just everything seems to be a big cloud over my head, that I can't get rid off or shake off. Part of the reason I've been so moody lately.

But I decided to look up some of my old friends to see what there doing and see if I want to go back off this road I'm on and take the other.  To see if all my choices made sense. And there was one ... old friend, that made me have an epiphany. An epiphany is defined as a moment of clarity where everything makes sense, and it did.   

I won't tell you who it was, unless you ask me in person, because I don't think that it's very fair.  But this person used to be very special to me a long time ago, and it took me a long time to get over losing their friendship. And I think about how special this person was while talking, and all I can do is watch the clock and think of how much time is left till Vick gets out of work. Call it cold feet to move ahead, call it being in neutral, call it whatever you want.  But I learned something. We may fight all the time and we might not have good times every time we go out, cause she's an asshole or I'm an asshole or some big fight or something insignificant that gets blown out of proportion by one of us. But there's one thing I can say, we always fix it and we always move forward, like any good couple should.

But as I was talking to this person, and listening to how their life has gone and just being in that surreal moment, talking to them again for the first time ... there was nothing.  It was like a hollowness; an emptiness. And in that same moment of weakness, where I was looking back at the steps I've taken over the years to get to where I am, wondering if I should turn back to come to that fork in the road and take the road I didn't take all those years ago; and not just with this person, but drop out again, or switch my major back, or move out on my own, or any number of things that I haven't done; The Road Not Taken. And then I looked ahead; toward everything I have ahead of me on this path. Holy Family University, my psychology career, and the most important, Vick.

I know we both have our secret doubts.  It's not anything that we can control. But when I tried to look back, and saw nothing there, not even the footprints that it took to get to where I am today and I look forward again and I see the woman I know now, in my heart, I was meant to be with; no matter the problem or insignificant thing that stands between us or divides us.  She's almost like Hermine in Steppenwolf.  She's a mirror.  She's the exact opposite of me in so many ways, yet she completely me.

And as for my career.  This is what I want.  I want to be a psychologist, no matter how I do it.  I want to go to Holy Family.

So, in a weird way, through all the confusion, through all the restless nights.  everything makes sense now.

There's probably so much more I haven't said and yet, so much more I can't say because I can't put it into words.

"event","Confusion ... such a funny word really.  There's no real reason to make believe it isn't.  Yet it has so much power over each of our lives, especially mine.  I don't let it.  I try to be calm, cool and collected and stay in control, but yet I always find myself spinning out of it.  How am I supposed to know what I want 20, 10, or even 5 years from now? I wish I was more like Vick, very calculated; knowing exactly what she wants and how to get there AND the steps needed to make it happen.  But yet, outside of that, I don't think she knows anything about how her life will turn out.  I suppose she's controlling the one part of her life that she really can grasp onto.  The more I try to organize my life, the more it gets flipped upside down like a child having a tantrum with puzzle pieces.  And my attitude doesn't help matters.  I think I'm getting asinine in my old age or just developing a short fuse to a powder keg.  Nobody's much help honestly either.  You tell most of my friends about ""your feelings"" and you'll get a sarcastic retort or a ill-timed joke back.  And everyone wonders why I don't talk about myself all that much.  Half the time I want to curl into a little ball and die, wondering if anyone will give a fuck that I'm gone, or whether they are too wrapped up emotionally in their own worlds to even notice. I know a few people would, but what kind of drive is that? My motto in life has always been ""I live today to see if I'll die tomorrow.""  Sometimes I think it's just out of morbid curiousity that I'm still able to get up in the morning. I know, I know. I have good people that care about me, probably too numerous to name, but by the same token, I also have my demons that I fight with on a constant basis. Sometimes I conquer them, something they conquer me.  Its an epic struggle, but in the end, does it matter?

Then, theres Vick.  I really love her, with all my heart and I can see myself being with her for along time.  We're soul mates on so many levels, yet not on so many more.  Part of me wants to marry her a couple years and part of me doesn't. I don't know what to do half the time. When we go out and have a good time, not even a great time, but a good time, its like magic.  Its an indescribable feeling; like this high that you never want to come down off of.  But, we do our fair share of arguing and fighting and not talking to one another, it feels like our relationship is on pins and needles on those occasions.  Although I do that with everyone, and its probably just me.  I think its my defense mechanism.  But after a year and half I guess I thought we'd be further then we are.  Not necessarily physically, but emotionally.  I guess I didn't think I'd have to walk on eggshells, thinking if I say something else thats stupid during an argument, that'll the relationship will blow up in my face.  I guess that's a sign of how much I like the relationship and how much I love her, but still, there are some things I would change and I'm sure there are some things she would change.  But in the end, isn't that all people in a relationship? Don't all people in relationships have something they would change about the other person? Is that what a relationship is about? taking the good with the bad and accepting that no one is perfect?

I think back over all my old relationships and all my old friends and think how much of a schmuck I was.  All the mistakes I made and all my character flaws that drove them away.  And here I sit again, asking more questions then I have answers.

If time heals all wounds, then time must have stopped.

"event","Yuppie soccer moms who spend way too damn much money on a costume for their two year old, should be beaten with a dull, rusty axe.  And I'm not sure about all of you, but I'm fond of candy I actually fucking like and I'll tell you what I don't, no ... NO ONE fucking likes.  Its those damn orange rubber door stops in the shape of a peanut.  Can't you get them like a thousand for a dollar at some grimy gas station?  And why does a brand new package of those things taste like they're from 1968?

And to all you yuppie soccer moms, here's a hint to save you $50 on a god damn spook costume your kid will wear once for three hours while you're standing there freezing your nuts off, making sure your little dumbass does hurt himself walking into a door instead of knocking on it.  Some of those glass doors are tricky, I know. Here's the tip, spend $4 on a bag of candy your little diluted sperm baby likes, and be done with it.  No fifty dollar costume, no freezing your nuts off in the cold October air.

And what's with these assholes that are bigger then me Trick or Treating? I'm 6'1"", 275 ... these assholes make me look like a midget.  Do you really think you look cool wearing make up and a Dracula costume when you're 23? All these jerk offs are apparently in the same club though. The No Pussy For Life club.  And notice how its all guys that look like retards anyway that do this?  Of course you'd have to be half a tard to begin with to prove you're a moron rather then just buy a bag of candy for $4.  My self-respect is worth more to me then $4, but apparently there are people among us that give theirs away for free.

DUMBASSES!!!!

"event","Vicky won't see me without a shaved face.  She has a hang up about it and chastises me constantly when I don't shave or miss a spot, to the point where I gotta go home and do it or do it better, so she'll shut up.

well, it was a funny story, not at the time ... but, yea ..

 my grandmother comes over to make my bed each day, cause she has nothing better to do ... and i was supposed to go get my friend from work at 1230 ... so, i'm in the bathroom shaving cause I'm running late (its about 1235 at this point) and also taking a dump, you know how that is ... and my cell phone rings and it's in my room.  Naturally, i cant answer it .... so it rings again, I'm screaming at Nana ""answer the damn phone"" ... shes screaming back ""I don't know how"" ........ so then the house phone rings ... and heres Nana trying to open the bathroom door ... so that's when I raked the razor over my face, trying to keep this hysterical woman out of the bathroom.  So, my pant's are around my ankles, cause I'm in the middle of getting dressed, taking a dump, and I'm bleeding pretty bad. Blood is just rushing down my chest as I'm trying to hold the door closed with my foot and shes screaming ""i dont know how to answer it, you answer it"" ... so I let her open the door a crack, so she can't see anything and it turns out shes handing me my damn cell phone, as the house phone continues to ring.

So, here I am with a phone that does me no good, my blood is gushing out of this gash I made in my skin all over my chest and stomach and down onto the clean shirt I was about to put on and towel I had in my lap.  So, after about 15-20 minutes of trying to make my bleeding stop, it finally does.

The shit I do for love."

"event","Is it wrong to want to show affection for the one you love?  And when does that affection become sexual? Who decides? And is trust the barrier between affection and sex? Does one thing really lead to another? Or can you stop at a point that is comfortable for you both?  And how do you talk about what is comfortable without feeling awkward and embarrassed? Is that true trust? The ability to talk about things that would otherwise embarrass you to talk about? How do you know when it's appropriate to talk about these things? Are you just supposed to know? How do you know when a gentle hand movement is a gesture of ""no more"" or ""try harder""?  When does oral communication shut down and body language take over as the only thing that can be understood? When does trust turn to mistrust? When miscommunication takes hold?  

When does anger take hold and hurt feelings?  What threshold does love have?  Is anger a stronger emotion then love?  Is god such a fool that he would install such an emotion?  Or are we the fools that must learn the consequences for our actions with the blood of relationships past and present?  Can we tame this beast called love while trying to tame ourselves?  Is there such balance within our hearts?  Does love conquer all?

I don't know the answers to any of these questions.  I'm not sure whether that makes me a horrible person, naive, or just a human being.  I don't need to know the answers to these questions I don't think.  I think as long as I know who I love, these questions don't really matter.  But more than just that, I think as long as I know who loves me, these questions don't matter.  My quick temper and affection don't matter, because when I get lost in her eyes, I know the only thing that matters to me is her happiness.

Hold on, hear me out ye of little faith, some people call gay men ""Mary""s and I think that's what the bible writers were trying to do too.  Think about it, but not too long, I'm probably wrong and you'll get an aneurysm."

"event","I was watching Brewster's Millions today. Its an interesting movie.  Basically, Brewster had to spend $30 million to spend in thirty days and if he could, he'd get $300 million.  BUT, there's a couple catches; First of all, he can't own any assets at the end of spending the $30 million.  Also, he can't destroy anything of inherent value. He can't give money away and he can hire people, but he has to gain valuable service.  And he can't tell anyone why he has $30 million or why he has to spend it so quickly, so he can't get help in spending it.

He also has a wimp clause, if he doesn't want to spend the $30 million, he can have $1 million dollars to forget about it.

Now, if you were offered this, would you do it? Or would you take the million and run?  I want comments.  If you would take the challenge, what would you spend the money on?

"event","1. Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering: ""Shut up, dammit, all of you just shut UP!"" 

2. Whistle the first seven notes of ""It's a Small World"" incessantly. 

3. Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside ask: ""Got enough air in there?"" 

4. Offer name tags to everyone getting on the elevator. Wear yours upside-down. 

5. Stand silent and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off. 

6. When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open, then act embarrassed when they open by themselves. 

7. Greet everyone getting on the elevator with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral. 

8. On the highest floor, hold the door open and demand that it stay open until you hear the penny you dropped down the shaft go ""plink"" at the bottom. 

9. Stare, grinning, at another passenger for a while, and then announce: ""I've got new socks on!"" 

10. When at least 8 people have boarded, moan from the back: ""Oh, no, not now, damn motion sickness!"" 

11. Meow occasionally. 

12. Holler ""Chutes away!"" whenever the elevator descends. 

13. Walk on with a cooler that says ""human head"" on the side. 

14. Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce ""You're one of THEM!"" and move to the far corner of the elevator. 

15. Wear a puppet on your hand and talk to other passengers ""through"" it. 

16. When the elevator is silent, look around and ask ""is that your beeper?"" 

17. Say ""Ding!"" at each floor. 

18. Say ""I wonder what all these do"" and push the red buttons. 

19. Listen to the elevator walls with a stethoscope. 

20. Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers that this is your ""personal space."" 

21. Announce in a demonic voice: ""I must find a more suitable host body."" 

22. Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button. 

23. Wear ""X-Ray Specs"" and leer suggestively at other passengers. 

24. Stop at every floor, run off the elevator, then run back on."

He's probably just hibernating. 
I'm making a citizen's arrest. 
So, you're a cannibal. 
It's probably just a rash. 
Yeah, I made the deciding vote on the jury, so what of it? 
The odds of that happening have to be a million-to-one! 
Pull the pin and count to what? 
Which wire was I supposed to cut? 
I wonder where the mother bear is. 
I've seen this done on TV. 
These are the good kind of mushrooms. 
I'll hold it and you light the fuse. 
Funny, you look just like Charles Manson. 
Rat poison only kills rats. 
It can't possibly rain for forty days and nights. 
This doesn't taste right. 
I can make this light before it changes. 
Nice doggie. 
I can do that with my eyes closed. 
Well, we've made it this far.

"event","I think if you rescue a chick and actually save their life, they should at least give you a bj.  Or at least your pick of their family.  You know, if she's a disgusting pig and you haul her Chevy truck bed size ass from a burning car, you should get to choose her hot cousin to bang.  You'd see a bunch more helpful mother fuckers around.  And it has to help you directly, none of this joining the army shit and getting a bj from every girl in America.  And there should be degrees too, if you help an old lady to her car and put her groceries in the car, you should get a hand job from her grand-daughter or if you perform successful surgery (not plastic) on a chick, you should get to bang her when she's better.

""What will that do?"" you may ask.  Well, it'll push a lot more kids through med school and prove that you really do have to get good grades.  Also, a bunch more people will want to become lifeguards and rescue squad techs.  And I think it would make the world a safer place.  Of course, it also works reverse, so if a woman saves a man, she gets her choice of him or his family, which I think is cool.  Equality, I'm all for that.

Of course, there might be some husbands and wives that might not like it, but if you're significant other was rescued, don't you think the rescuer deserves something other than a thank you?

Of course, there would be a bunch of rescuers at a time no doubt, so you'd get to choose which you want to be rescued by, if you're still conscious.  And if you're not ... Pot Luck!

So, write to your Congressman and tell him you want this law put up for a vote.  I think the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.

"event","I recently heard about something in college that was so awesome, I had to make up an award for it and give it to the guy.

Apparently a schizophrenic got out of a mental institution and went across the street to a local convenience store and started getting blow jobs in the parking lot.  This act, in and of itself is amazing, but the fact that HE was CHARGING the GIRLS FIVE DOLLARS to suck HIS dick, is the best part.  Now, the price isn't spectacular, but the fact that he could charge someone anything to do all the work and get nothing in return is every scammers' dream, but this guy has the best scam I've ever heard of.

I salute this man, on behalf of every other man on the planet."

"event","So much has happened, that I can't describe recently. I don't even know why I'm going to try,  I don't know why I'm writing this, and why I think I should. But I'm going to anyway.

I just think my body and mind have undergone a revolution recently and things that were so important to me, aren't now.  Call it a rearrangement of priorities.  When it comes down to it, people that you choose to associate with are all that really matter so you have to make those choices wisely.  Not to say family doesn't matter, because I know the old saying ""you only get one family.""  And my family is great, on the whole.  Sometimes it may seem like I'm complacent when it comes to them, or anyone for that matter, but I'm really not.  I take them for granted too much, I know, but maybe it's because they've always been there physically or not enough emotionally.  I can't tell.  I've always been an emotional wreck and the more I think about it, the more I straighten myself out.

As I said previously, Vicky and I have had our ups and downs, but I'd rather have a down day with her then an up day with anyone else, as cheesy as that sounds.Recently, it's been as good as it has been.  I think we're finally getting comfortable with each other.  It took a little longer then it usually does, but I guess that's how you know you're with someone special.  When you don't have to rush to get comfortable with someone, but you were always comfortable with them from the start, if that makes any sense at all.  What I mean is, I guess I feel like I can tell her anything now, when before, there were certain things I didn't want to give up about myself. Certain things I thought maybe she'd judge the wrong way.  And to tell you the truth, I don't even know what those things are.  So I can't just list to her everything I didn't want to say before.  It's just I know there's been times when I've held back.  I guess as I think of stuff I'll tell her.  It's not like I intentionally do it, I've just been burned so much, its hard to open up anymore. People that have known me 8 or 9 years don't even really know me.  If they actually knew the real me, they might be surprised I think.  But, I think we all do that to an extent, put on a face that people want to see rather then what we truly are.  I guess that's how you know when you're with someone that you truly love. When you can trust them enough not to burn you when you show them the real you.

So anyway, Vick and I both have our own lives, but I would definitely do anything for her. I'd do anything for any of my friends, but especially her. She's just ... it's hard to explain without getting too personal. She's everything I want to be.  She has a goal and she's pursuing it.  She has a great family and friends that truly care about her well being. Not to say I don't have that, but she has her life so figured out and I'm just now starting to do that.  But it's so much more then that.  She completes me I think, in a weird way.  We can have an argument and not get mad at each other.  We can have a bad time and shake it off.  She makes me do things that I ordinarily wouldn't do even though it's in my best interest.  Like, go back to college.  Go work out hard enough to be able to do somethings that I should be able to do if I was ""normal.""  Maybe that's part of my problem too.  I never consider myself ""normal"" and maybe a little worthless.  I don't know, sometimes it feels like I'm trying to prove something to everyone and it seems like I have nothing to prove to myself because I'm constantly worried about what other's think of me.   Sometimes I wish I could curl up within myself and not have to worry about anyone but myself, but where would the honor and pride be in giving up?

I don't know.  Maybe I gave up too much personal information, but who cares really? Only a few people are going to read this and I feel better. And isn't that what this thing is for?

"event","... however good or bad that may be. Anymore, my life feels like one big roller coaster ride.  Just a whole bunch of ups and a lot of downs too.  I wish I could say there's more ups then downs, but I really can't.  I don't know what's going on, day to day, anymore. And everything seems so important, yet so damn unimportant at the same time.

Where to start ...? Hmmm ... I guess start with the most important and work down to trivial.  

Me and Vick have been great for a long time now ... almost a year and a half.  We have our rough spots, but in the end, love conquers all I guess.  Little cheesy, I know, but it's the way it goes.  I wish I knew what she sees in me honestly, maybe I wouldn't have such low self esteem.  I must be doing something right. I just hope I continue.  Sometimes, I know I come on a little strong for her, but you never know what tomorrow may bring, so you gotta do as much today as you can.  But uhhh ... I just hope there's a lot of tomorrows with her.

So that ends my cheesiness.  I've been thinking a lot about death recently, and not about myself dying per say ... which is a first.  But just about, not saying what you want to say or doing what you want to do, cause when your life's over ... and you've held back, how's anyone going to know what you really thought? or even what your really like?  which brings me back to Vick for a few lines, so bear with me, I have this complex, where I have to say ""I love you"" to her, and sometimes, I know, it goes to weird lengths like she told me tonight, but what if I die tomorrow and I didn't say it? would she naturally know it? Probably, but still ... I'd rather over tell her that I love her and appreciate her, then tell her too little or not at all.  I'm not a ""she knows how I feel"" kind of guy.

But anyway, someone close to Vick died and she's as well as can be expected. But she brought up a point, that prompted all that.  She didn't really talk to her friend that passed all that much in recent memory, but they were on good terms when she died.  And she's kicking the shit out of herself emotionally for not talking to her more, even though she really had no inclination that this was going to happen.  It just sucks that hindsight is 20/20 and I never want to leave this type of problem when I die.  But wounds heal, over time.  I guess that's why I keep my friends so close.  You can never get those you love back and its got to be the most horrible part of living and the easiest part of dying.

I don't know ... I don't know much anymore.  I don't even know what I don't know.  It just seems like my life is a whirlwind right now.  Between everyone and everything in my life, its weird to me that I haven't picked up a knife and tried to end it all, but I guess that shows how much I've grown as a person and how much everyone means to me.  I really don't even think about doing that anymore, except when I take a step back and really only as a musing.  It seems to me I just need to stick to my convictions and do what I say to myself.  Get stronger, mind and body, and be a better person.  Of course, if that was easy, everyone would do it.  But I think I rush into things too fast and get overwhelmed too easily. That and my ""OOOO, SHINY!"" complex doesn't help matters much either.  I just need to take things slower I think.  Retrain myself to think about tomorrow as being a fact and not a possibility.

I let my site's registration lapse.  so no more withmymind.com.  I wasn't updating it anyway, no one was reading it, and my web master isn't on at all anymore.  One year was enough and this'll be the new home of anything weird and funny that comes out of my brain.

Sonja's been worrying Vick lately, which in turn, worries me, because she always brings it up.  I don't know what she thinks it'll do to just talk about it.  I understand her frustration, but we can't get inside Sonja's head and the more you ask her ""why,"" the more frustrated she becomes with all of us.  You can't badger Sonja into doing something that you want and I wouldn't want to impose my opinion on her anyway, because I'm not with them 24/7.  She's 22 years old and it's her life.  I can tell her my opinion till I'm blue in the face, but will it matter? Probably not, because I don't know the full story.  You hear things through the grapevine that may or may not be true.  I can tell you one thing though, if he hurts her, I will hurt him.  Its just hard when you can see the future so clearly for somebody else and they can't see it for themselves. Rob's probably been the most vocal, but all it does is drive sonja away from him, and I don't want that for me and Sonja. It's just such a helpless situation, like when you're the witness to an accident, you want to warn the people involved before it happens, but you can't.

I started college back up again.  Its been a good experience so far.  Thank god.  I don't need a repeat proformance like last time.  I think Vick would divorce me even though we aren't married and my dad would disown me.  So thats not even an option.  But, more then that, I think I need to prove to myself that I'm not completely useless.  That's always been something that I've battled my whole life.

My ex-favorite aunt and I aren't speaking, which is cool with me.  She wants to start shit in the family using me as a pawn, then throw it back on me.  That's retarded, but it's fine.  She wants to give me this grand speech about how she told my mother when she died, that she'd take care of me, then betray my trust and call me a liar.  That's what pisses me off the most about the whole situation.  Is that how much she thought of my mom? Screw what she thinks of me, I could really give a fuck less.  But is that what she thinks of my mom's memory?  Fuck my aunt.

I'm still writing, as a matter of fact, I'm planning to start a story that I hope I can stick with long enough to make substantial, but I doubt that'll happen. The working title is ""Godless Heathen"" and that's all I care to release about it at this moment.

I'm sure there's a ton more that's happened recently, but I forget or don't care at this time.

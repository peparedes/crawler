"event","I'm one of the most self centered people I know. So.

Google me please. and if you're viewing my livejournal as a google stalker, thanks. Seriously. I've googled everyone from my past, even girls I crushed on in 3rd grade. 

<img src=""http://members.aol.com/sasonalmah/smitten.jpg"" />


Here's a list of crushes to the end of junior high school. This does not include fantasies. Just crushes.

1) Alison __ was actually my ""finance"" in Nursery school. One time I told her to call this Asian girl named Jennifer ""jenny, for short"", in order to ""make fun of her""..She took it quite literally and called her ""jenny-4-short""

2) Arielle Simon-Kindergarten.  We road the bus together to Riverdale country day camp. She lived a block away from me and her mother went running every morning. She's probably a secretary now. Maybe she works in human resources. 

3) Lisa March---2nd Grade. Another elementary school ""colleague"" of mine, however I only developed a crush on her years later, in 2nd grade. She had a younger sister named Anaka who I was not attracted to. I believe her parents were psychologists or social workers. 

4) Noelle Chapplain- 3rd  Grade. She was the first girl my age to cross her legs. I said ""fuck"" alot around her to impress her. She moved away to San Fransisco the following year and I have not been able to find her on google, or friendster, or myspace since. 

5) Lucy Eggleston--4th Grade. I wonder if she was related to William Eggelston. Probably not. I only had a crush on her for a week.

6) Julia Stiles--The actress. 5th + 6th Grade. Most likely didn't know my name. She left to go to Friends Seminary. Now she's in US weekly, I think. I listened to a lot of wimpy heavy metal and I used to hear the song ""Love of a lifetime"" by Firehouse, whenever I saw her. Gay.

7 )Abby Biberman--6th grade-7th Grade. She was actually friends with Julia. I liked her because she was Jewish, had braces, and liked Beavis and Butthead and Murphy Brown and Chicago Hope. I found out that she had a crush on some boy named Joey Mintz and this pissed me off. 

8)Nora Feher. 8th Grade. Her mom had been friends with my mom earlier. She was my first crush who was actually my friend. She liked Operation Ivy and Rancid, and I thought this was incredibly cool. She ALMOST said yes when I asked her out."

He washes for a good minute. then goes to the paper towels and takes like 25 feet of paper towel in intervals of about 6 sheets at a time. then he goes and washes his hands again, takes *mad* paper towels throws half of them out, crumples the rest into a ball, walks to the door, and takes a 3-point shot into the garbage can."

""The thing about Harry Potter, it's crazy, you know? That woman JK Rowling or whatever her name is is a fucking billionaire. I mean, she's got every market tapped, not just the seven year olds and dudes who want to get inside Harmynie. Take, for instance, this woman I was dating, I mean I'm not dating her anymore, not necccesarily because of Harry Potter, but anyway...A few weeks ago she invited me upstate to go to this Harry Potter reading, or convention whatnot, and so I went, not 'cos I liked Harry potter, but, of course 'cos I wanted to fuck her, I mean, that's my only reason, you know?"""

"event","Men in baggy pants and khaki Caterpillar boots take the best shits. With silver belt buckles tapping the bathroom tiles they grunt and crack their knuckles like a milkshake of construction worker and anxious jew. They wipe themselves in crumpled up toilet paper balls of indefinite lengths, always in one-ply. When they pee, they leave the seat as-is, dribbling and spraying about, never wiping their remains.

Today a man in baggy pants and khaki Caterpillar boots took a shit quicker than my piss; wiped, flushed the toilet with a fish grip handshake leaving a poor impression on the bowl, and stormed out of the bathroom without washing his hands."

This time I used the middle stall. Man wearing soiled brown Hush Pupppies and tapered khaki dockers walks into the stall beside me. Four rips of toilet paper scattered about the seat, sits down, plops twice, flushes, plops twice, flushes again, plops twice, flushes again, plops twice, flushes again. I guess he didnt want to fill up the bowl."

"event","yesterday at work I went to the bathroom to pee. The handles to the urinals are always wet and disgusting so I tend to use the stalls. Or maybe I'm just too much of a jew to pee in the urinal. I used stall #3 because the door to the first stall was occupied and the second stall has been famous for its pee ridden seats. When I closed the door, I heard a quick zip and rustling of feet followed by  a ""have fun on your trip,"" a high-five, and a furious washing of the hands."

Joe says that the trick to de-ghettoizing chunk light tuna is to drain the water completely.
I think he should shut the fuck up and get some corn rows. 
Raymond would be funnier if his last name was Simkowitz."

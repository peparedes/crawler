"event","damn. cant believe its been over a year since i last wrote in this sucker. a lot has happened to me too. i did move away to texas for a bit, but i decided to come back home to va. missed everyone, plus mom aint gettin any younger. been back since arpil of 2002. just been working and tryin to have a lil fun.  obviously things with Christian didnt float above water. it was over before it had a chance to get off the ground i guess you could say. he got scared of his own feelings. oh well. 
right now im not at my best...im really at my worst...i dont know if i could get more depressed. its really not just one thing, its a lot of things piled up on each other. i had to have some major stuff done on me and ive not adjusted too well from it. i mean..the end result is great. i look great...but i just dont feel right when i go to sleep at nite. ya know? then my last job i had, at Travelocity in clintwood, it was just too stressful for me. i wound up having to quit. i couldnt handle it. plus dad fell off the back of his big truck and fractured his elbow and a lower vertebrae. lovely. he is ok now just in pain and stuff.
i started having bad chest pains a few weeks ago. even went to the er twice, but there is nothing physically wrong with me according to them. so i am going to be giong to see a counselor. im almost positive i am what they call clinically depressed. ive looked it up and i match all the symptoms. its so bad that i dont wanna lay around the house all the time but yet i dont wanna be anywhere. i went to walmart a few nites ago. it was crowded. i didnt feel like my world was crashing down or anything like that..but it basically freeked me out when we got back home. i had to cry for a bit before i could do anything else.
sad thing is i think that the things that make me so depressed are things i think are stupid to be getting depressed about. makes me feel even worse really. i dunno what to do or what to think. i was hoping that maybe writing in this again would help....if i can keep it up. ah well. i should get to bed. much as i dont feel like it. but dad wants to go to the bank tomorrow to refinance my truck.

"event","Things are going good I suppose. I am still working at that damn gas station LOL. But I don't know where else to go to right now. I need something that will pay me at least $8 an hour. grrrrrrr. It's so aggravating. And frustrating too.

Things are going okay with Christian I suppose. Haven't gotten to talk to him since Thursday nite. Still taking things slowly. I don't wanna go slow, yet at the same time I do. All my other relationships I was in a rush and pushed a lil too soon. We can all guess where those ended up going. heh. So maybe this will work if I go at his pace. Much as I don't want to. LOL. Ah, need to learn better patience. Such a key factor in many things these days. He seems to be worth it tho :-) I am happy just to get to talk to him sometimes. And he is in college. Going to make something of himself...I'm so proud :-P hahaha. He is supportive and sweet and caring. And sexy too. hehehe. I can't think of much else to ask for. LOL. 

Had to move on Friday. We found a nice trailor nearby in a town called Willis. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Perfect for us. My sis decided to only pay part of the rent at the apartment so she could afford to pay some of the deposits for this place. Therefore, we were evicted from the apartment lol. Had to move in a lil sooner than we planned, like a week or so early, but we managed. Couldn't get the power turned on until yesterday. And the phone wasn't hooked up til today. Lovely, huh? LOL. Ah well. Everything is fine now. That's all that matters I guess. 

I shall go for now and see who all is on my ICQ and how many msgs I have waiting for me. Peace and love dahlings.

"event","Well howdy. Told ya I would be back LOL. I'm pretty dang tired tho :-P Worked my lil arse off tonite. Anyways, where was I? Oh yea, I was talking about Christian. hehe. I do think he is pretty damn sexy tho ;-) Ah well. I will be fine. I have been missing talking to him at nites. I think it is weird that I am missing him, but I guess it's normal if u like someone. I think about him quite a bit too. Someone help me out here. I am confused about my feelings. Do I really like him? Or what? I think he likes me too but I'm not sure. He was typing the words to some song from Nitemare on Elm Street 5 in the chatroom one nite. I asked him what it was and he told me, but a couple days later I find an email waiting for me from him. And its the song he told me about. Plus he sent me another song by the same guy that he thought I would like. Which he was right, I did. Did I mention b4 that he tells me I'm beautiful? I find it so hard to get, considering I am sooooo not used to being told any such thing. So, tell me if u think he likes me too. I hate this sometimes. I can never tell these things. I can very rarely tell if someone is flirting with me. Dammit LOL. OOOOOOh yea....another thing, Christian always asks me if there is anything going on with me that I wanna talk about and he tells me I can tell him anything. Ok Ok Ok Ok Ok. Enuff about this b4 I make ya sick to ur stomach and u don't ever wanna read this again. 

I'm gettin pretty sleepy too. Guess I shall go for now.
Much love and happiness.

"event","Heh. Damn. I find it a lil hard to believe I have really been here almost two weeks now. I started my new job last nite. Never knew how gas stations ran, LOL. It was fun tho. I got a lot to remember, but it really isn't all that different from Wal-Mart and K-Mart. This might be the best job for me right now. I get to meet all kinds of ppl and stuff. 

Alicia tells me I am living her dream by just being here. She asks me everytime we talk ""Hows Texas?"" LOL. She is hoping to one day soon make it out here. I hope she can too. I miss her big mouth heehee.

Christian (dude I know from a chatroom on aol) sent me his new pic. Hot damn! LOL. He got to be pretty damn sexy. Too bad he is livin in Indiana. Hehe. He tells me I am beautiful, hmmmmmmmm.........Dunno how to take it. Not sure if he likes me in that way or not. I ain't totally against online-dating, cause I know of quite a few couples that started out that way. (Okay, so they all came from that chatroom I go in LOL give me a break!!) But anyways, I think the feelings would have to be a lil stronger for each other than they would be in person.

Well, I would love to continue this subject, but I need to finish getting ready for work. Much love!

I feel kinda weird and maybe even a lil outta place too. I dunno. This is the first time I have been somewhere so far away from my mom..not to mention the fact this is the first time I have lived somewhere without her too. It's a lil scary really. I miss all my friends for sure. If I had just one of them here...it probly wouldn't be so bad. I would feel 'safer', I guess is the appropriate word. This apartment we are in right now I really don't feel too safe in. It is ok..but I think I might feel better in a trailor or something I guess. Well I am goin now. Still kinda sleepy from my long drive Wednesday nite 
:-)
Nite and much love."

I must also say that everyone pray for a friend's mother...she is not well at all and could use a few extra prayers at this time.
And *hopefully* on a lighter note....I got my belly button pierced yesterday. heh. It feels so weird. LOL. But then again, I guess it should. hehe.

"event","Oh my goodness.........I met this totaly good guy last nite. I mean he is so nice...N-I-C-E!! In every sense of the word. If I didn't already believe in love at first site, I am so sure I would now.hehe. 
I was riding around Wal-Mart doing my usual schtick...thinkin bout goin home cause everyone was pretty much gone. Then I saw this jeep roll in. Guy looked aight...ya know....so I kept my eye out and stuff. I was playin around with this other dude tho. And then the cops rolled in too...so I left and rode downtown. Came up by the park to see if I knew anyone up there. And there he was. He was just getting out of his jeep and going to sit on the lil wall there to smoke. He looked kinda pitiful I thought all by himself, right? As I was goin to leave, something told me to swing back around and go talk to him if he was still alone. And he WAS!!! I pulled in and stuck my head out my winder and hollered hey. He came over to my car and we started chit-chatting. He put out his hand and said his name was Jeremy. I told him mine too of course..heh. We b-s'ed for a lil while. He said he was from bsg. He just turned 23. And he does construction-type work right now. I think. heh. He asked if I wanted to go for a ride. So we hopped in his jeep (which is pretty dang nice if u ask me LOL ~ its a 99 and a goldish color w/ 30-day tags still) and rode up to high knob ~ for some odd reason~heh. We made it up to the tower and just parked there. We stayed there for like 2 hours!! just talking. He even started getting silly and makin buncha noises and stuff. It was actually really great. I kept laughin, he was so silly!! Just like me!!!!!!!!!! LOL He told me he would take me back to my car whenever I wanted to go , but I was enjoying myself too much. Told him nah I was having fun. He was surprised, he said he didn't think I would be just sitting there talkin to him. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww :-)
But then some ppl came up to where we were, so we left. He took me to this lil lake that I didn't even know was there. And it was sooooo pretty! It was the most beautiful site I have ever seen in this place. I wished it hadn't been so chilly and windy out cause I wanted to stand on the platform there and look at the water. And a lil while after I said that, he took off his jacket so I could wear it out there while he smoked a cigg. (he has a thing for not smoking in his jeep) We stood next to each other on the platform just lookin at the water and talkin. God it was sooooo nice. I was in heaven. LOL It's been a while since I enjoyed myself so much doing so little, ya know? 
Oy I feel so dumb tho. When I left him I told him that I had a really great time, and he said he did too. But we didn't exchange no numbers or nothin. :-( I could almost cry thinkin bout that. I had the most wonderful time that I can ever think of having in the past. And all I have to show for it is the memory. I hope I can see him again. That it is in my fate to do so. I prayed on my way home that it would be. Well I am gonna get off here before I make myself cry cause this is so pitiful. Later"

That's when mom and dad's court date for the bankruptcy is. Shew. I dunno...maybe it's just me...but I feel used here. I think they are expecting me to be around for a good while, like at least another yr or more. I got news for them, I got plans. I ain't gonna say nuttin tho til it is closer to time for me to go. Don't wanna give them all this time to dispute it and try to talk me out of it. Don't need to be put in the position at all. My brain is going in enuff circles as it is trying to make sure everything is gonna work out to leave.

Had an interview at Syke's this morning. It went fairly well. I gotta wait up to wo weeks b4 i can hear anything bout it. I am starting to question whether or not I wanna do it tho. The woman let me listen to a couple calls to give me an idea of how it will go when I go to work for them. I have a feeling that my hatred for customers will be fueled, ignited, ablaze, and out of control. Not that I can't do it. I can. It's just wanting to do it and not getting all stressed out by it. That is my problem. That's why I had to leave K-mart. That and they just couldn't seem to realize it would make more sense to hire more part-time ppl so that their full-timers would stop getting so much overtime. Ah well. Not my problem anymore.
Although, I do not recommend that anyone get a job there. You WILL hate it. Guaranteed.

On a good note....LOL.....I got lil mister Josh to open to me last nite. He needed to talk to someone. I knew he needed to, and he knew he needed to. So I finally convinced him to do it...hehe. I dunno tho, maybe I helped him out and maybe I didn't. It's hard to say. But we did talk for quite a while. Well, I am getting frustrated at someone right now. So I better get off of here and cool off. Lata!"

He was fun to talk to, but not my type. :-P  I was quite proud of myself...hehe. I hollered at all kinds of cuties. And actually got a few to pull in where we were at. hehe. I flirted like crazy with this one guy I went to school with. He flirted back, so it's ok. haha. That's the best way to be. :-P And dear Rhonda...LOL...she is a nut and a half. She is old enuff to be my mother I think. She has a daughter that is like not quite old enuff to drive I don't think. Ah well. LOL. Rhonda kept all of us rolling while she was out last nite. She told us of a trick she can do - picking up a quater off the top of a beer bottle. I will leave to the imagination what it is that she picks it up with. She is a trip, and pretty damn perverted too. But she is hilarious. I met all kinds of guys. There is one in particular, Wes. He is funny, but not exactly my type.

"event","Well, I dunno really. I had such fun last nite. I've been kinda dwelling on it. lol. I am going to take Roger to Guest River Gorge tomorrow after the movie. Since we did all that walking last nite, I ofund out he has never went under the tunnel at nite. It is so odd. It gives u almost a feeling of helplessness because you absolutely cannot see anything in there. But yet it is cool too. It really cannot be totally described, you must check it out for yourself. But I recommend not going alone. 

I am a lil worried bout my dear friend Alicia. She wants a bf it sounds like to me, but I really don't think she should have one just yet. Ever since her accident in December, she hasn't had the right amount of time to really get over it. It totally knocked her for a loop and rocked her world. She has an idea of that, but I don't think she fully understands it. And where her ankle is still causing her problems, I am afraid it might be effecting her more than she realizes. She gets extremely offensive about her scar on her ankle. And with that disease too, RSD, it is really bothering her. At least I think it is. I believe it would bother me. And we aren't that much different. Besides, it is something that is affecting the rest of her life. Because things were not done quite right in her first surgery after the accident, she is going to have to have another. I don't know what to say or do for her. Except be there for her. Which I am to the best of my ability. In a way I guess she needs a bf, to have someone intimate to talk with. But then again....grrrrr.....I dunno.

I'm also worried about my other dear friend Andie. I just don't agree with her decision to stay with PeeWee. He hasn't been good for her. Past few times I've seen her, she was no longer the sweet and loving person she has always been. His bad attitude and defensiveness of his practically retarded behavior has rubbed off on her I'm afraid. And I still cannot get over him tellin her that she was causing him to put his life in danger just to have a job. All because he decided to try to become a miner. How dumb and munipulative is that?!?!?!?!?!?! GRRRRRRRR.....He aggravates me so much they way he does her. Tries to turn everything around on Andie. All the dumb things he does, tells her she is the reason cause if she was with him and living with him then he wouldn't do those things. Like he isn't man enuff to not do them on his own. Hardly anyone treats him like a grown up anyways. So he must feel like he doesn't need to act like one. I'm gonna end this b4 I get too into it. And possibly ruin my mood. It's all ready almost spoiled. Later."

Got up to find a note from mom inviting me to come to her church and see the teens and college-kids that came up from our old home, Charlotte, North Carolina. Plus there was food!! hehe. Ahhh...it was nice. I also met a friend of mom's and mine, Faye, whom I have not seen in quite a while. Afterwards, I went to my bro's and hung out with him while my nephew Mikey was takin a nap. Then dear unt Rocky came home. haha. So I went into her and her daughter's room and hung out with them for a bit. I haven't gotten to do that in a while. Forgot how much I like to...haha. I left her and found Mikey had awaken, so I played with him a lil while. He is so cheesy. It's crazy how he and Shawn can alter my mood. No matter how I am feeling, they make me feel better. I came home to find mom chillin' watching tv. A rare site indeed. hehe.But the poor woman deserves it. We busted our arses yesterday doing yard work. blech!!! :-(

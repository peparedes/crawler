"event","This weekend was incredible. Two awesome shows, Seven AMAZING bands. You should be very jealous. 

We drove to Indy on Sunday, thinking we'd get to the show right at 7:30 when it started. And that was perfect. None of us wanted to hang out and be early for this show... But we are all retarded, apparently, forgetting about the cool time change. So instead of being right on time, we were an hour early. Sweet! We made good use of our time though. Got some Bawls in our mouths. Good times, good times. 

Next week will be just as amazing. 
Tuesday: Atreyu and The Used. 
Friday: Mae and Simple Plan.

Next Thursday: Letterkills and SOTY. 

Mmhmm. Awesome."

"event","Tonight is Green Day, NFG, Sugarcult. Woohoo! I am excited. It's been forever since I've seen Green Day... like junior year when I went and saw them in Columbus with Blink and Saves the Day. Hopefully this one will top that.

Tomorrow we head to Indy to see Mest, Hawthorne Heights, Punchline and Bayside. I think I'm more excited about this concert than the other one. I've only seen Mest and Punchline. So, that'll be fun...

And it's all time well spent with the boyfriend and my siblings. Sweet, family road trip.

In the mean time, I am stuck at work, watching the second hand drag on."

lost!!! i made it 3 min into the period. and then i had to talk to
him.. ok it wasnt my fult it was his.. he wouldnt stop talkin to me!but
anyways,, i think that im gonna give up.. yea i like the kid alot.. but
it just doesnt seem like its worth my time.. hes talking to everyone
about his feelings and i dont know a thing.. and that bothers me...
maybe he just doesnt want&nbsp; to talk to me or maybe he just doesnt
know what to do.. i just really want to know what the HELL is going
on!!!&nbsp; i kinda wish that i had the balls to say somthing to him..

""so your radar's going off??"" OMG i wanted to DIE it was sooo
embarassing.. i decided that i make and ass out of myself whenever he's
aroind and its not on purpose... but yea and he knows about this web
page.. so im PRAYING that he wont read it.. but if he does oh well!!
maybe one day he'll figure out that i like him and maybe he'll do
somthing about.. or maybe not.. cause u all know me im to chicken to
talk to him about it..&nbsp; and i think me and kristin really freeked
him out yesterday in sh.. caue agian i made an ass out of myslef!! haha
that tends to be a common trend.. but yea im kinda hoping that i see

Do you ever feel like breaking down?<br>
Do you ever feel out of place?<br>
Like somehow you just don't belong<br>
And no one understands you<br>
Do you ever wanna runaway?<br>
Do you lock yourself in your room?<br>
With the radio on turned up so loud <br>
That no one hears you screaming<br>
<br>
No you don't know what it's like<br>
When nothing feels all right<br>
You don't know what it's like<br>
To be like me<br>
<br>
To be hurt<br>
To feel lost<br>
To be left out in the dark<br>
To be kicked when you're down<br>
To feel like you've been pushed around<br>
To be on the edge of breaking down<br>
With no one's there to save you <br>
No you don't know what it's like<br>
Welcome to my life<br>
<br>
Do you wanna be somebody else?<br>
Are you sick of feeling so left out?<br>
Are you desparate to find something more?<br>
Before your life is over<br>
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?<br>
Are you sick of everyone around?<br>
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies<br>
While deep inside you're bleeding<br>
<br>
No you don't know what it's like<br>
When nothing feels all right<br>
You don't know what it's like<br>
To be like me<br>
<br>
To be hurt<br>
To feel lost<br>
To be left out in the dark<br>
To be kicked when you're down<br>
To feel like you've been pushed around<br>
To be on the edge of breaking down<br>
With no one's there to save you <br>
No you don't know what it's like<br>
Welcome to my life<br>
<br>
No one ever lied straight to your face<br>
No one ever stabbed you in the back<br>
You might think I'm happy but I'm not gonna be okay<br>
Everybody always gave you what you wanted<br>
Never had to work it was always there<br>
You don't know what it's like what it's like<br>
<br>
To be hurt<br>
To feel lost<br>
To be left out in the dark<br>
To be kicked when you're down<br>
To feel like you've been pushed around<br>
To be on the edge of breaking down<br>
With no one's there to save you <br>
No you don't know what it's like, what it's like <br>

with each other.. (like that will ever happen) haha but the only reason

to be a really long day... i got to eat ice cream in Marketing today
which was fun and the hott kids in that class (and no i dont know his

here are some&nbsp; quotes to maybe keep in mind:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;~Things change constatly dont hold onto 1 moment 4vevr move on <br>
~Love is always patient and kind It is never jealous. love is never
boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take
offense and is not resentful<br>
~""Love is something you find and can never lose, just misplace.""<br>

Well, I walk into the room<br>
Passing out hundred dollar bills<br>
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill<br>
And I buy the bar a double round of crown<br>
And everybody's getting down <br>
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same.<br>
<br>
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br>
Cause I saddle up my horse<br>
and I ride into the city<br>
I make a lot of noise<br>
Cause the girls<br>
They are so pretty<br>
Riding up and down Broadway<br>
on my old stud Leroy<br>
And the girls say<br>
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.<br>
Everybody says<br>
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy<br>
<br>
Well I don't give a dang about nothing<br>
I'm singing and Bling- Blanging<br>
While the girls are drinking<br>
Long necks down!<br>
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy<br>
or my Chevrolet for your Escalade<br>
Or your freak parade<br>
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town<br>
<br>
And I saddle up my horse<br>
and I ride into the city<br>
I make a lot of noise<br>
Cause the girls<br>
They are so pretty<br>
Riding up and down Broadway<br>
on my old stud Leroy<br>
And the girls say<br>
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.<br>
Everybody says<br>
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy<br>

<i>[Spoken:]</i><br>
I'm a thourough-bred<br>
that's what she said<br>
in the back of my truck bed<br>
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds<br>
Out on some back country road.<br>
We where flying high<br>
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time<br>
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.<br>
But her evaluation<br>
of my cowboy reputation<br>
Had me begging for salvation<br>
all night long<br>
So I took her out giggin frogs<br>
Introduced her to my old bird dog<br>
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of<br>
<br>
And we made love<br>
And I saddled up my horse<br>
and I ride into the city<br>
I make a lot of noise<br>
Cause the girls<br>
They are so pretty<br>
Riding up and down Broadway<br>
on my old stud Leroy<br>
And the girls say<br>
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.<br>
Everybody says<br>
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy<br>
<br>
What? What?<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well this morning went good but then i ran into
nick..and you all know how me and nick are... well were getting over
the fact that i made an ass of myself at homecoming but i dont think
were to the point where we used to be..the you have matt... totally
different story.. i love the kid to death hes soooo much fun to talk to
and he really listens to me and im sooooooo glad hes in my life but the
fact that hes in love with me and i dont feel that way kiinda creeps me
out.... see he let be barrow a cd... which im listening to and its sooo
good... but he always offers to do things for me and i dont want to be
mean and turn him down and i dont want to use him..cause i know how
that feels.. (andy enough said).. yet i know that there is no hope for
me and nick cause i know that he doesnt feel that way about me.... then
theres ricky... yea ex-bf ricky...he sayes that he likes me again and i
dont think i want to go down that road...but i have to big of a heart
to hurt anyone...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other than my boy problems that i always have im
doing ok... ive been kinda down latey i guess its cause today its been
2 months since my grampa died and that impacted my life alot.. i know
somepeople are just like get over it..but this is the first loss in my
family that i really had to deal with every other one i was to young to
remember.. and i loved my grammpa very much we were very close....
~RIP~Grandpa Calleri ~<br>
<br>
I hate all the drama at school.... everyone is always backstabing each
other... kimmy and kay finally stopped fighting (thank god!!!!!!) but
ive learned that you cant trust anyone... i know that not very positive
but thats what ive come up with becasue everytime i tell somone
somthing someone else ends up knowning.... so ive decied that im not
trusting anyone again... nah that will last like a week... haha... <br>
<br>
<br>
well i out for now!!! ive got homework.... grr pre-calc!!! <br>

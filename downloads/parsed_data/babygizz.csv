Oh my word. i am soooo dissappointed due to the fact that <FONT color=#66ffff>me and unity have done some extensive detective work to try to figure out what movie ""home skillet biscuit"" came from. We called half of the worlds population, then when we reached our boiling point, puddy decided she wanted to stroll in here and break us down even more by telling how it came from ""that's so raven""</FONT> </FONT><FONT color=#33ff33>can u say dissappointment?? yeah but im over it now nd im goin to go conversate so ill update eventually.

"event","iite this is only my second entry cuz i forgot i had a live journal. yea so anyway. this weekend was one that i'll not be complaning about ne time soon. The highlight was friday night at the last 15 minutes or so of the dance. But there r alot of things that suck at the current moment though. # 1: the fact that I have enough spare time to b writing in this damn thing. #2: The fact that I like the person (once again) I thought I was way, way over. Well actually i'm not sure if I like him but I just can't get him nd his stuff outta my mind. Yea well i think that was a really good update... hector is sexxy. I love dima nd I have nothin to do with my life at the current time. Ok i'll probaby b hittin back today on a different subject. oh yes before I leave b-ritt, ash and scuba I love u guyz, But dima thinks ure all crazzy."

"event","since I just got this, I have some respectable shoutouts to give to deserving people.
Nee unit- U started anti- social, now there isn't anything ANTI about u. There isn't too much to say besides I'm glad I met u. BANGERFULICIOUSNESS for life.

Ronald- U R THE CRAZIEST person I have ever had the pleasure to come in contact with. but I would never want u to change. This friendship started in art class (briana nd the vibrater) and I hope it lasts along time. SA   SA

Chanda- We've been friends for a long time. We had our ups and downs but just remember noone can break up the dynamic duo because- we playettes that ride and die together.

Brian- I have nuthin but love for ya. Marriage is thicker then blood. I think we have the best relationship that a step brother and sister have ever had in the history of forever. Let's keep it that way.

Toasty- What happens in the mountians stays in the mountians

Big B- I give u the keys to the cakes ( just don't eat em' all at once)

Crispy- I love u but I  do have one suggestion. Find out what micheal jackson used to make him white. and ask him if u can borrow some. I mean that in the best way possibe;.

These are some of the people that mean the most to me in my life. LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY"

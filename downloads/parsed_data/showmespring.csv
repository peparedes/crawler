"event","you painted such beautiful silhouettes
you painted white trees against monster gray skies
white paint covered your hands,
the hands that eventually held mine
but I <b>hate</b> everything about you.
The shadow of the monster on your face -
why did you never paint that for me or <b>with</b> me?
I could have done it.
We could have painted away those green eyes that trapped mine
drowned your pupils in turpentine
but instead your pupils bore into mine
and never let me be.

I feel you on top of me with seventeen hands
on a thirteen year old body
I see your silhouette every place, every place
the movie theater the park the dark bar
I'm too young to get into
I see your silhouette in the moons
and in every fucking Starbucks
or fair trade coffee shop
floating on top of my lattes, the white foam mocking me;
while all I can see is paint, white paint

I can only paint the silhouettes now
you no longer exist in my light but
you are reborn to me in the darkness
when I see a white rose I just see the outline of your hand
crushing its petals between your thumbs
and I can never forgive you,
I will forget everything but the silhouettes
for eternity.

just sticky coffee and the cheap tricks

saw the picture of you, beautiful and wispy

and caffeinated
and full of neon hope and thin arms

and she could dance beautifully and 
multitask with a cigarette and a phone and a song 
and a glass of warm wine
she could do eyeshadow and lipstick

she was perfection
and she always learned the hard way
she played the good music and 
wrote the good songs

"event","the bricks on the patio
redder than my skin
your hand in mine
warmer than i could even recall
where was this place
next to the train tracks
and the rest of the city
which never seemed to sleep
and concrete stairs
leading down to nowhere
the underground world, dark with stars
of glow sticks and glittered hair
and girls kissing men
and girls kissing women
pale blue and clear and teal stones
grace the bottom of their red heels
watching them dance for too long
makes us dizzy
so we pretend
and we pretend
while you hold my hand that we'll never be anything
or we'll never need anything
besides ourselves, besides our drugs
our wild companions
our hairspray and Beatles posters.

when did i let go?
i know it isn't time -
you climb on stage and stare at me
teal, focused eyes -
and i fold.

"event","a sense of loss, a holiday
in a crowd of angry smoke
outside freezing in a winter fleece
full of things i cannot say
i tried my hardest,
and you went away
and now i've nowhere to go

how did we get to this silent place?
flicking cigarettes and angry faces
instead of car drives and laughter
and feeling whole with diet cokes
and smiles with dimples
and complete sincerity in parking lots
now turning to others instead of each other
how did we get to this silent place?

"event","after every glance - it's over
where did you expect me to turn?
green movie preview screens
in a haze of yellow outdoor light
where did you expect me to turn?
it's been one more day
of me just saying i'm through
and one more cold night
coming back to you
at the end of the day - it's all it is
at the end of the day, one more cigarette
another five minutes of silence
that i worship
where did you expect me to turn?
scribbled notes and heads turned
and cold benches with no words - 
last year left,
in a blur of car rides
and smoke and night air and music
and late talks and parking lots
last year left
ended with a door slam
a wave goodnight
ended without reciprocation
ended - 
crying on a bathroom floor
reaching far
grasping air
gasping 
anything - too far away
tempted to dismiss you
just to let it go

"event","next time around maybe i'll say no
until then you're just a child
in a small red and black striped shirt
and an ice blue baseball cap
riding on a cold leathered train's backseat
never knowing where you're going
heart stamps on the back of your hand
maybe telling of
where you've been and who've you seen
and maybe every boy you've loved
or the number of secrets you kept from me  
the days you have left
once they're finally numbered
death is a game and life is a fight
but keep your eyes on me
i stood my ground and you took your flight
and now i'll never know

i do it because of you
i do it because of you

because i know i can't 
have your eyes or ignore your arrogance
there's no one left to hold my hair
when there's no one left to hold your hand
after a caffeine headache and too much aspirin
and too many tears to hold in
and i'll say i'll never be there
after the hundredth lie 
and the hundredth manipulation

but babe, i'm right around the corner
when you need me

next time around maybe i'll say no
but i'm lacking 
the ability to spin around
and walk away"

"event","i am stuck in a sea and i'm wandering
and you're so far away right now when
you always said you'd never leave, well
i did it all for you, you said
and i held onto everything
maybe someday
maybe someday
i don't know why you mean that much and
i don't know why i'm struggling
but i've fallen somehow in this mud 
and my boots can't let up
and i'm missing you to death
and i'm too close to dialing 
a seven-digit number well
keep saying it's just a phase
you're just like any other boy
wandering and stupid and lost
and i'm just like any other girl
complicated and no consideration of cost
listening to pink floyd and thinking
i'm a teen for nothing
wondering about comfortably numb
when i've fallen and i'm still mumbling
you could be the one, i think
to listen when i talk
to hold my hand and hold my hair
a friendly kiss goodnight
if i'm ever able to get there."

"event","i withheld everything
you'd be too hurt to hear
too angry
too hateful
too dark on this cold front porch
a swing and a pillow
and seven hours
a hundred cigarettes or more
and a desire for coffee
at six on a sunday morning
in awe
in shock
that the girl yelling at this dog
would never understand
and i love you,
but i love him
that walking disaster time bomb
that i can't help but care for
fifteen more dollar bills
for four more packs of cigarettes
just to watch the smoke
waiting for the fireworks
we know we'll never see

"event","new york is just
a little too much like anywhere tonight
in march
in fog
in weariness
and i'm so damn tired
of every flashing light
every honk
every insult
everything i wished to be
and every night i've been crying
in this strange town
in the bottom of a porcelain shower
'cause i'm still thinking of you
this far away
in this strange city
'cause it's still march
in this strange city
and i can't help but hate you
and i can't help but miss him
i want a cigarette
and i want life and light
and i want relief
instead of these stupid glass elevators
gracing every hall
instead of company i detest
and cold water on my shoulders
hoping for april to come early this year
instead of broadway shows
and prada bags
and cheesecake and blisters
burnt hot dog spring air and
carousel rides
mud and sore throats
and missing you to death.

i wanted to hear
but the firecrackers in my ear
allow me to void you, null you
i'll never know what i've wanted
but now what i've got
well, what i meant
no longer means a thing
but i meant every sound
and every thank you and every tear
it just didn't seem real until now
and now i've got a future
screaming tacky vegas night lights
straight into my face
leaving everything i claimed not to love
should never be this hard
but nothing will take its place
i wasn't thinking, 
i didn't think at the time
but everything i claimed as mine - 
late nights, pizzas, cold beer
laughs while sirens rang in every direction
i've missed it now
the five years that flew by
the fact i can't move
every time a clock ticks softly in my ear
the purple haze can't leave me now
glitter black sparkle nails
can't save my soul
and your spark, excitement
will not leave my memory
and i surrender what i knew
to every aspect of you
and every grass stain
that mattered"

i followed you inside but 
all that reached my ear 
was a cold silence - 
then a recorded message, so blunt
so stationary so far
from how i felt
all i felt

was the cold water on my fingertips
burning like acetone
in your bathroom sink
you called them <i>lagrimas</i>
in an awful accent
and i cringed

my necessary break from you - 
you laid nonchalantly on a couch
you'd never let me sleep on

woke up the next morning with so many bruises
tears from you
you were convinced it was the devil 
that had corrupted you and i 
stepped outside for half a moment.

my lips cracked, your fingers bled
and i couldn't hold still
you couldn't hold it in
you screamed
and i watched

imagining you pale
cold
dead

as winter

until i learned
to let it go.

took a leap to the other side
on a tuesday i wasn't looking for
mixed you a drink and handed you
the ripest peach from the bowl
wished you'd jump with me but all i could do
was touch your sunburned skin and your 
over-bleached hair while you slept
silently on my pillows the same pillows
i breathe your scent from 
every night you're not around
and drink another glass of orange-juiced vodka
another slice of cold pizza
pace around for an hour and an extra five minutes
crush tea leaves in my palms
burn sweet strawberry incense and watch
your eyes flicker below your lids
push ""glow"" on the alarm clock to see how many hours
i can watch you sleep still
still
light four more candles and kiss your cheek
curled my hair and smiled in a dark mirror
of reflections of you
your goofiness
your loveliness
well...
i'm always too hopeful 
my head is always too full
and foolish but
i think i found a hand to hold.

how many times do we have to circle
around and through again
your almost i'm-sorrys
my almost i-love-yous only repealed
because i really do 
another sheer blue vase broken
another few flowers dead
another sigh - so collective
so heavy because they know
we shouldn't see each other
at least not like this 
and how funny it was
to think you could change 
to think i could 
give you a rose you wouldn't crush
red petals between your thumbs
to think you wouldn't
add another stitch to my lips 
if you ever got the chance
to think you'd give a damn
the next time i doubted you
she got to you first
cut you down after a fast back-hand slap
and a yellow-purple clean-cut bruise
after fifty i've suffered through
how much do you feel now?
your fake police siren music-maker
your fake laughing at a water-drop covered violet
your fake grin
your fake bitterness
my undying desire just to figure out
what fucked you up

but maybe it was nothing

but maybe it was me

i'll never take further than 
your pink lying lips
your death green envy eyes
you always shine on me and
if i knocked on your door tonight
you would lock your door tonight
and i'd wait so patiently until morning
on your front porch
because that's what you wanted
crushing my toes on the pebbles on the pavement 
because i know that's what you wanted
every word you've said to me -
well i've analyzed you to the core
if that's what you want and i discovered
it's only what you wanted
to hear through those ears
to hear instead of constant shouting
backed into a dark wall with a cold-hearted tv
and a brown-haired infomercial announcer
spitting fumes
spitting lies
spitting everything you'd never wanted to say
but had to anyway
because it wasn't enough to release yourself
and it wasn't enough to release me
from your arms
but you could just turn around
so easily turn around from me
let your tears fall - so easily away from me
for the first time
lack of answers but i KNEW
because i know you.

so you don't need to slip past
slick plastic and your metal can
of intoxicating hair spray fumes
and you don't need to drown 
in plastic dixie cups of vodka
or call me and ask me to tell you
that i love you

because you should already know.

"event","i could always drown between words
between words like love and light.
when no one followed me
when no one wanted to go the same way
nobody wanted to change a feeling
of hopelessness.
so i was left on cold train tracks
singing about love
while another tiny house of straw
burned to dust and ash.
another needle punctured a water bed
of the blue people who never slept anyway
and i muttered. so tied down
about love i'd never experience
and liquid lemon sugar 
i'd never be able to taste
and dialed numbers that never got me farther
than a hello.
a glass wall rose and my voice got caught
and the yellow flowers bloomed on your side
and the red ones 
you desired because they bled so strongly
thrived on mine - 
a communication gap only explicable through
our commonalities
our fear of knowledge about the only things
too personal to share but we could anyway.
on a night of train tracks and horns 
and too much beauty it made me sick
you couldn't hold my hair back and i couldn't
explain my feelings
that maybe i could only love you 
'cause you were the first one
i saw.
how much i gotta move. take a train
pick a rose and put it in my hair.
drive with me and ask for a ticket [or two] and 
we
will
fly
and guitars can play when you float higher
but the glass never ends
it browns
and fades
you're too gone to let it shatter
and you'll never reach me
you'll never be there that night and 
if you ask me...
i'll never take you home.

everything you said 
so freely flows through the epitome 
of my being - the center
of every stupid poem and every insult
i could ever think to say
so long after you've gone - 
'cause you never stayed around to see it work
'cause you were too certain of yourself
'cause my lack of courage changed my mind 
on an summer's tuesday
when i got so close to swimming
when you weren't there that day 
when i got so close to loving someone
when you weren't there that day and
there's so little i've known
so little i've grown since then
and too many times i've thought of you
watching kids in an idle classroom
and clouds in an idle sky
and i fell alone, like you said
i always would
it just wasn't as hard 
as you wanted it to be
just so much harder
than i thought it would be and
how can i help you stand
when you're all you'll ever be
how i've learned - when neither of us
will change 
and we won't get anything back
in this life
when there's no afterlife to speak of
how can i help you stand
when you're all you'll ever be?

it's raining 

can't hide my arms -  a cellular phone
gripped by freezing cold hands.
'i hope you're indoors...'
so sincere - how sincere can you be?
how valid of a question can you ask?

...so i lie.

numbers you say i should not feel
so ashamed to be a part of 

your little red notebook
helps you accept your fate
and every stupid analogy you use
helps you overcome something you'd
always refuse to talk about
it won't bother me - whatever i am to you
as long as you just tell me -
but never doubt how much i love you
it's just a matter of questioning...

how honest are you?

no, nothing's the end of the world
not my life, not a violation
not debris and not the endless
projects you put me through
not a thrown away plate of food
not a disappearance or a red tear
and not death.

not your warm dry hospital beds
with white sheets.

everything i forgot -
you're so very temporary
so permanent in my memory 
of daydreams and wondering
where i'd ever go with you
maybe wishing was better 
than the reality which followed
maybe i'd rather have the dream
than a kiss and a wave goodbye
maybe if i weld the metal
just right and i 
place you in between
love and hate and i connect
my heart and mind -
such an idea... but so far off
from what's real
i held you closer than i ever 
thought i'd be able to 
how proud you should be and
how much shame overpowers you
how could i resist?
your tears blinded me
how much i couldn't cry
for you this time
even though i thought we'd mesh
thoughts of how early our lives ended
we'd share memories
that could leave us crying in
my green pillows for hours
my desire not to 
scared me
and my lack of self control
frightened me
and my happiness 
overwhelmed me
how far my heart could sink 
surprised me
as i finally cut off our connection
with bumbling thoughts and
excuses
and i locked the door
you gave me a glance that i ignored
and fell asleep
quietly

a filthy green shirt
holds an empty black guitar case
to form an image
he always fit anyway
only...
curly black hair worries me too much
and purple scratches 
from a thrown ladder 
thrown to the floor
a floor covered in stop baths
and clothespins
and ruined photographs
and a small white string
tying a world together -
quite his only world
except . . . her
""i don't want to lose her""
just pull the curtains across
and no one's
gonna see
pull the curtain across
smash a vase against the wall
pull the curtain across
no one's gonna be scared
just pull the curtains across
and no one's
gonna see

i ran twenty miles in a 
broken blue green glass bottle
and wondered about your heart like
what if yours is broken?
or charred in a fire
from a bridge you tried to burn
when you promised me
you'd never say it again?
a regular - a low-key
incognito 
don't want to speak - so
cotton is a good excuse
for anyone of your stamina
anything you want to be
and i'm all right - 
with ten cotton balls swelling
in my throat
and ten not-so-empty threats burning
behind my eyes
and an empty laundry basket
all i can see out of the
corner of my eye
or..your eye - yours at the moment?
only a possession of yours as my soul
floats to the door
a soul which should never leave a body
or maybe just thoughts
of another dream
maybe just thoughts that
perhaps---
through a twisted way
and miles of cotton perhaps
an aura of truth could still surround you
another rubber bracelet ripped
could still affect you
another scent of my perfume
could still intoxicate your
eyes which i will always regret being blue
but deserving? 
you must deserve them somehow
and there is something there that
perhaps i'll never see
or maybe they're just thoughts
of another dream
a deep breath that you always caused
something -- i hate you for something
that makes my ankle hurt 
everytime i look at a scratched-out
candid picture of you with that silly coat
and your bangs hanging in one eye 
which will stay forever locked
in a thousand safes
which i will never be desperate enough
to open
never again to see your face
or the pain you chose to share with me.

nothing but the clearing of throats
in a quiet room 
and leftover photos stuck
with sticky tape or perhaps
the overwhelming humidity 
to the walls 
with the so-called encouraging statements 
typed on red circles of paper
which never stopped anybody
from ending something they 
could never physically start

and the brown haired boy has
stared out every window
and he's still never found what he's looking for
talk of trust and confidentiality
when freedom is what he needs
another door another window another dream
and low-life confessions 
that are barely confessions and
a few lies that aren't really lies
but an aura of sleepiness
and sleepy bodies surrounding
what could have been a true being
had he been
completely alone in the world.

im still waiting
in a cold white-sheet room
re-crossing my ankles
over and over
re-discovering every hint
to apply mascara without crying
from the glamour magazine
shaking in my hands

my eyes on the articles
glittering with headlines
and my thoughts on the memories
glittering with your smile
and your red hot fingertips
from when the matches got too low
and your sadness got too high 
and your arms got too covered.

im too fooled to ask.
im too confused to clarify.

toned arms 
lie pale and white 
closed eyes and a head of 
glass, 
lungs fill with water
a tree sits forever
dented 
and a pool sits forever
tarped. 

alive...? 

were you ever?

laughing. [unacceptable] and shivering
shivering by an air conditioning vent
lost in a cell-phoned conversation
about nothing.
wondering if the day happened
or if illusions are becoming 
a cocoon of hope.
same clothes
same places
same feelings [as yesterday]
and waking up every morning
checking every 
lost memory of you 
to see if i've understood
your offhand comments and 
supposed lies which were just
pathetic attempts at love - 
- constantly successful and confusing
especially to you.
blocking out images 
because learning that you could hurt
meant i could hurt more.

they thought we were alike
but i never could've been you.

it was never you.

your laugh succeeded in 
making me laugh in a 
cold
blue nightgown on an edge of a pier
a seagull landed and you didn't even care
didn't bother to throw a 
dry crust just watched
'he looks scared... like you'
a rational statement
that made me cry in your
flannel for an hour

but it was never you

your laugh succeeded in 
making me cold in a 
wide open space - 
an excitement, a scarf
and purple nails 
and a beat up truck
and a seventeen year old boy - a friend
never a friend
evil, but beautiful -
a night of dance of broken ankles of 
blisters and red shoes and 
things i'd never worn

but it was never you

your laugh succeeded in 
making me shiver in a 
drenched cabin from a 
dark rain that never fell
never burned out the fire
that never stopped burning
never stopped burning my skin
fuel 
fuel
fuel burned
a cry sounded - a sob
it felt like a match
it felt like a fight
it felt like 

i'd never stop dying

and it was evil - 
a smile
a smile that was

always you

a failure of
comprehension
the monotone of a formerly
harmonious voice
echoed in the receiver
as a thin black needle
rose itself, lowered itself
nested itself in the grooves of
a record
while a thin black needle
burrowed itself deep inside
a thin white arm
of equal proportion to a stomach
to two legs
and to only one ear

a cold january day
left me with nothing but
a cold january dial tone
seven hours of persuasion
so many dollars in phone bills
never changed her mind
a begging voice
never changed her mind

she could swallow a fire
but choked on the match
thought she could burn
burn 
through a thin white arm
did nothing but 
pull her into a white gown
covering the burns that
hold so many secrets
and a needle ripped
a vein broke
and she cried and
she looks like
she looks like she's 
still beautiful

welcome signs blur
neon lights
a need of rest covers
the glare of the sun
on wounded skin

small brown cork
captures every bubble
in every bottle
sitting on his shelf
i'll never destroy

green loves a hand
and his hands love
the green
needles through ears
destroy every sound

it would all be all right
but the need of remembrance
will haunt every 
disturbed soul in the
bits and pieces of us

the floor begins
where the ceiling ends
everything ends where
we can see
and not beyond

there is nothing higher
above what we can touch
a lack of hope
a lack of faith
a lack of health

left him wounded.

water

'we all miss her' 

your head against the clear plastic the shampoo
running off our hair and our
cheap jeans and any clothes
we found out of kellie's closet
and tears 
and it tears us inside

'we all know how to cry'

swift shoes 
he walks to the window and presses
a dull hand against the frozen glass
and lifts it up with a noise that
makes the whole world gasp
'look . . . look at the snow
look at the way it falls
it lands on your eyelashes and blurs what you
never saw at all' 
and the hushed silence is more than i 
can take and i'm sick of them
listening to him and . . .
and the confusion rises within everyone's
mouths
sour with whatever we've been drinking
and my brain is too heavy to
understand him
nobody says a word and i can't take
the terrible noise of quiet
'it never snows here'
 i say with stale breath
and a sour undertone that makes
 the silence become louder inside
my ears
and the people stare at me like i've
crushed his only dream
and perhaps i have but i think
he should be dreaming about something
much more important
the hug that follows creates the sigh
of relief rise upon the clones
he tells me it's okay and stares into my eyes
grasps my hands and he's so
cold and he whispers
'just look into your soul
i've never found what i've been
supposedly looking for and i'll never 
know what it's like and what it's not
but at least you can because you're
not . . . not . . .'
the dimple never shows when he's been drinking
because vodka will never be his friend
and it is too hard to recall what he says next
but i am sure that it is not
'i love you' as others claim to remember
there are not enough things 
there are not many things 
that i remember
just his stale breath
and my head slamming against the corner
of the glass coffee table
shattering of glass 
like the ice that
suddenly appears outside
and i look . . . look at the snow
i look at the way it falls
it lands on my eyelashes and blurs what i
never saw at all

and he's not here to see it

something so strange about the way 
he yells and the way he confirms
the way he whispers
""you'll never admit you liked it""
ripping my plaid shirt
the only one worth wearing and the
only one i can feel comfortable - touching my arms 
the shame swiftly morphs
into amber-red rage and
my hair is so tangled that i can't
hear his voice in my ears anymore
i can just remember how much i
wanted to change
and now wondering how much it will take
to get back again
and it's not that long before he 
starts crying and he slams my wrists against 
the stucco
""why did you 
why did you have to give up?"" 
i would tell you if i knew because
i want a response and i want to
show you how much i know
and you're right -
i'll never admit that i liked it
because i didn't
because i never will
and i'm not afraid to
tell you that tonight 
you're not my king nor my savior
and you are not better than i
you won't admit you need the power
just to stay alive
it's not hard to notice when your eyes turn green
there is nothing in your words
except an undertone that suggests
the control and hate surging through
endless miles of veins
the meaning is lost under my feet but
surely it goes to my heart
""you'll never admit you liked it""
no, i won't
because i didn't
and i'm not going to lie tonight
and the floor touches my face
in a sharp rush of your own pain
as you whisper bitterly
'merry christmas bitch'

'you can fall alone or 
stand up alone
the choice was always yours'
paralyzed words cold
brushing near the fireplace
ideas
just brushing by the fire
just feeling i could burn
everything 
feeling a pit so strong
a gut splitting a beautiful
thing, object, place
what do you see
certainly never me and
this place ... such a beauty
i'd take an axe to the table ..
to the floor to his wrists to his arms
never gave me a reason never
gave me a reason and he'll
never see i'm cold
i can't give you a reason for
the things i do and don't do
i only remember the feelings
the feelings and the grass and the
splinters of the wood the floor 
so frozen from his formerly warm arms
his hands got so cold in three weeks
i'd take an axe to his heart to his throat
i'd nail him to a cold wooden board for eternity
never let him die
i'll never let him die
the control under my painted fingernails
bamboo shoots crawl from my skin
a need for torture a need to pray
a need to pray for nothing 
absolutely nothing - purity
a night of peace of quiet of not
having his heart his face his breath
on my heart my face my breath
every second
i can't get deep enough i can't
ever get deep enough 

i can fall alone
and i will fall alone

in a house of yellowing bricks 
in a cult of secrets of 
true love maybe behind our
crazy minds
one can say a word and 
be thrown out our window
and one may burn beauty
with cigarettes and cold smoke
and stay as long 
as his black lungs desire
our human flesh
a trail of ashes on our stomachs
left us with a craving
of control and water torture
our dreams left us dreamless
once we tried so hard to 
simply work our way in
under our skin
this time we just want
to get out of the one thing
we've controlled
the one thing we've trapped
ourselves 
so deeply into
the flame leaves scars on
our own pale bodies
our forked tongues 
rings of hope
none of us have the power
for the evil have control
we hold the beliefs and
truths to be self-evident
that others must bring flowers
to our own graves 
we will NEVER hold the flame
for we have the necessity
but never the power to leave
leave from this house of
burning bricks

underneath the ceiling 
void of every star
in every country of

fingers strumming  softly
'sweetie what did you take?'
cars rumbling with the

watching from afar
'you promised you'd control it'
maybe he did but maybe he

it's colder now and the heat is 
flowing but never out of my own body
'sweetie how do you feel'
our wrists are tied behind our backs but not

tape she pulled across our mouths

cold puddles to your office that
drench the jeans you love and
the K, who knows what it stands for?
it takes three times to get
to the right building 
waiting for hours
before you rush out -  glasses
smudged to the side and
finally a beard growing
you take me in and . . . 
you know the toys
disturb me with their
posters on the walls
'thank you' and 'merry
christmas' it's so sad
they have to come to you and
how old do you think i am?
there must be a reason
'i get the feeling you
don't want to talk'
clenching nails into hands
wishing to morph to my younger self
i want to i want to i want to
i wish i could but i can't
so i'll shake my head
'i don't want to . . .'
i wish i could tell you why
why i can't let them
ever know
and who's susan
the little girl who drew you
the picture and wrote the
alphabet in twisted arrangements
made happy faces on the wall
and wrote 'feared' with your markers
in the waiting room
what is she afraid of?
i wish i could - so i could see you again
but you can't find me 
'i feel like
there's something you're not telling me'
it would have to be you
i like your solemn voice and your
liking of the word 'blurry' and my descriptions and
the intent way you stare at me
like i really have anything to tell you
'hmm's after everything i say and your
questions and you not telling
a word
to 
anyone
and i can't believe that 
i wish you'd know that i'm lying
but now i can't see you
for six months
if not later.

deep breaths and closed eyes
gripping salty hands
with icy gray fingers
'careful, you'll have to
let go eventually'
our worlds are separate
connecting them with glances
containing only glares
'we loved you 
as much as we possibly could'
memories of rain flood
our ears and the beautiful 
arms have disappeared
'careful, we have to check
your pulse'
crossing wrists, grasping harder
who begged you to control
the little girl? 
'there's more to it than you 
ever assumed'
now with beers and pretty girls
glances - ever so tough
don't you ever get scared? 
'does you heart still beat
in a shallow chest?'
it was once a new world with
the glamour and eyeliners
in the metal box
'do you still possibly 
love yourself?'
whispering to selves making
molehills out of mountains
was it always this hard?
'don't judge us, we're still
reaching out'
longer fingernails and
the painted surfaces - yours
were the most painful
'please don't let my heart
bleed again'
i guess we always knew
i've felt enough guilt
for the both of us
'i just can't stop wishing
you were here'
and i never knew that
it could be so hard
to let you go this way 
'and if you need us, we'll always
be on this dirty street'

don't you realize i can't forget
any words you've ever said?

tiles in the bathroom 
i need to regrout them even if
the party's still blasting
on the other side i don't
mean to be a cinderella and i'm
not trying to act like you, i just
wish that everything was clean again
sometimes i just need relief
sometimes i just need to
hide.

please remember darling 
i was never betrayed by
blue green eyes
so it's okay
to grab my hand and i 
never did let you go
just 'cause i've never let 
anyone here go before

and you say you're
worried that i'll never fly
but you're afraid of a lot 
of things, darling
and i'm just afraid of 
hitting the concrete 
like he wants me to
hard, like one of you

so it's okay to keep crying
and it's okay to keep trying
just not with me
'cause if you had a sliver of an
idea of how much she needs you
i truly believe 
you'd understand

soon you'll know
who you're
so much better off without

sometime this spring
some late march night
when it's warm like 
july days and there's no way
that you can save her - 
you won't have to leave me
because i will smile and finally
learn to fly
from his window
and not be afraid of the concrete
scraping my neck

and please don't be sad
because she's got brown eyes
but when she says
that she loves you
it's the first time 
she hasn't lied

the dirt i've seen 
has too much glitter 
and too many sparkles
sleeping between masses of
brown mud
it makes it hard
to give up that way
but he always told me
'nothing is
impossible'

and up through the ground
i still see nothing
but murky brown
and i'm still sick and tired
of whoever's watering it 
and even if i asked 
even if i was nice about it
he would only plant daffodils
just because yellow ones
are the only ones that die

and even if i asked you
if i asked you nicely
you would only plant daffodils
just because they're my 
favorite flower

and you're so much alike
so much alike that way
and i'm sorry for the
distance that keeps growing
with every breath and every note
i know it's my fault
but i'm so scared
and you have my heart
so don't hurt me

you're just so much alike
so much alike that way
and you're the only reason
the reason that keeps me going

you're too much alike
too much alike in that way
and that's the only reason
why i'm able
to let go.

"event","geez. my journal seems awfully depressing.
things got better in my life since the ending of school. 


i gratuated.
got kicked out of my house three days after my 18th birthday.
spent 47 days homeless. 
got an apartment.
got my license. 
going to school.
got a car.
blew up car.  
working at deja vu.
getting ready to move to richmond. 



i don't really need anything except someone to sleep beside me. 
things in my life are looking up and up and up. 
well, besides the fact that i have to be up in 7 hours and i still have a four page paper to write. 

i think i might go to eku for forensics
and get a bartending license.
 
the venture brothers are on. 
fucking yeah dude. 
so i'm gonna stop procrastinating and sip on my milkshake and type this paper.
or, smoke a cig and then do that. 

damn it."

"event","So. 
I did it again.
&& this time it hurts.

I think I fucked up big time.
I always think that, and it just hurts now.
I can't leave something just physical, 
and now i'm hurting.
I always get attached
and I hate it.

I want to just stay away.
Why can't I just not go around him?
I mean- fuck- I don't know what I mean.

I don't like getting attached because that means i'm happy with him.
And that will only get me hurt.
Maybe I want to be hurt
but he doesn't.

Josh&ryan kept referring to me as matt's girl.
whatever
i found it kinda funny
and i was about to punch josh in the face
XD

my brain hurts
and my heart hurts

samantha went to common grounds last night
with PUCKETT
and i got pissed
i'd never say anything to samantha's face
but for christ sake
she cheated on me with him
and he's fucking disgusting
like seriously.

i'm becoming attached to matt
i guess he only wants shit physical
i'm just gonna leave it alone for right now
like totally.
i'mgonna see how long it takes me to 
write him a myspace message or post on something. 
i need to break this before i get hurt. 
i need to break this now.

<321
someone help.
I don't want to find myself changing for him
but it's already happening
I quit smoking 
I mean 
COMEON kayla
Why the hell would you want to do that?

i'm hurting myself
just to hurt him
because i'm suffering

he thinks i'm bulemic
it's kinda funny
i'll let him believe what ever he wants"

"event","so, i decided to start typing in this motherfucker since i don't like typing in my myspace blog.


things are getting so complicated. 





samantha- i have no idea what the hell i'm doing anymore on that subject. i mean the way i see it once a cheater always a cheater, but i miss her. i really do. she asked me if i felt awkward around her, and i responded with ""no i don't feel awkward around you, it's just that sometimes i wish i could reach out and touch you, and i can't, because if i do, i'll just get hurt all over again."" brutally honest. 

matt- since i last typed on here a lot of shit has happened. i've met matt. 
i don't understand how to explain him at all. we met over at josh's house and it seems to me that spencerian apartments are where i go totally wrong. i mean last wednesday i had sex with matt. 

WTF WAS I THINKING? i mean honestly wtf.

on a scale from 1 (whore) to 10 (virgin) i'm a 9.5.
here's the lowdown: 
last wednesday i was supposed to stay the night with syd. 
but she couldn't pick me up form work.
so i get matt to pick me up and we were gonna hang out for a while
but a while turned into 2am 
and it was just a game of foreplay 
and then at 545 in the mornign it happened. 
i got to syds at like 630 
and fell asleep for like 30 mins
and then got up tried to smoke a bowl
almost threw up
drank a rockstar
smoked two bowls
went to the science fair 
fucked with a bunch of little kids
went ands smoked at david's house 
and then went back to school

now things have changed drastically, i wish it didn't, but it has. 
he doesn't want a relationship, okay that's fine.
he tells me that he can't worry about anyone else right now, because he's trying to get off x and he's trying to stay focused on school. okay. but when he heard that i got hit by the two roommates i lived with, he drove 120 back from olive hill. i mean, that's caring isn't it?

he says we're so different yet so the same.

i think the best thing that he ever said to me was in a myspace comment, he told me ""you look so.. you in this picture. i know you love your piercings, and so do i, but i love the natural beauty underneath."" wtf? gah.
he also told me that i'm the coolest girl that he's ever met, the most unique girl he's ever met,and i'm gorgeous. wtf. maybe i wasn't meant to understand boys.

when matt told me that he was gonna beat the fuck outta the room mates i started thinking. needing help makes me weak. i can't start depending on people, not now. beacuse i've been in so many situations where i was totally alone, and i had only myself to depend on, and i'm getting scared because i'm getting weak. i can't need people. and i feel so safe when i'm around him. i do. i am so stupid for ever going around him, but every decision i make is a right decision. no matter how much it hurts. 




i wasn't prepared for this. 
not at all. 
i don't think i could have prepared myself for this. 

i keep listening to ani
over and over
hoping she'll tell me something
give me a ray of hope
and one day 
the smell sunshine
will help me overcome my fears
that day can't some soon enough
i'm driving myself nuts
but whatever happens happens right?

















i'm dying."

"event","today was a good day.
i spent the night over liz's yesterday and liz geneva and i got up at 1 and went to the skatepark to hang out with rocky and monty.

liz and rocky look so cute together.
monty looks so lonely.
liz and i are afraid that he'll be so desperate for a gf that he'll get a girl that'll treat him like shit.
if that happens then that bitch is gonna die.

it's 2am. i gotta be up at 8. fucking band. 
i love band but i really don't want to fuck up my summer.
my social life down the drain.
no more anything. 
fucking a.

i had a convo with eric today. 
it hurts me saying that he isnt loved.
everyone there loved him.
and still do.
i wish he would stop dxm. 
i dunno if that's gonna happen,
cutting is stupid.
next topic.

larry and i are fighting over money. 
as per the usual.

marching band is going to kill me.
i'll be sxe for awhile.
and liz hates band cuz it's taking me away from her.
and i don't get to see samm as much. at all.

kelsey and miriam. wow.
3000 miles away and they talk all the time.
that is determination. 
no wait.
that's love.

well i'm gonna go try to find a cig.

<321

Today was liz's party and we got fucking crunk. a ton of shit happened... like eric cutting the fuck out of both of his forearms and shit like that. 

Relationships:
Harrison and uh.. that one girl. 
geneva and zak
liz and rocky
sam and i (<321)

marching band is starting up again.
which means...
(negative effects) 
no shows
no drugs
no alcohol
less cigs
no sex (i'll barely ever see samm)
and no social life.
damn.
(positive effects)
lose weight
get excercise
look better (everyone knows i need that shit)

yeah at the moment, i think that the negatives outweigh the positives, but what the hell i'll do it anyway.

i haven't even started summer reading. 
yay me.

i have no car.
until i'm 18,
in college.
fuck.

yeah i'm too drunk to go on right now. more later.

fuck the police. 

Today was the rally. and oh my fucking goddess. 

I left school around 3:30 and walked to the bus stop and caught a bus with david to the bus station where we took a transfer to the uk student lawn.

it was out three fully loaded corners against the one corner that was pro bush. we had a great time picketing until it happened. 

cops were getting irritated and kept yelling at us to stay on the curb/sidewalk. when a supporter of bush tried to cross the street (jay walking) the cops got pissed and tackled the guy back to the curb and tasered him. he was just crossing the damn street.then three of anti-bush supporters rushed over and tried to get the four armed police off of the guy (not physical just words mind you). but unsuccessfully. the police tasered and restrianed the other people even though they weren't resisting. the pol9ice officers pushed ppl into the bushes and told them to get back even though we couldn't move. traffic was really heavy and we picketed police brutality when the three commrades and the bush supporter went into the police van and got taken away. 

the police fucking tasered a 15 year old kid for trying to tell the cops that the guy was just trying to cross the street. he wasn't even fighting. he didn't even resist. it was so fucked up and they started pulling mase out when we wouldn't leave. i and a few other people kept picketing until they threatened to take us away into protective custody. i went to david's mom's car and the girls from howlyn underground picketing. it was so fucked up. we weren't even obstructing traffic or ther cub or whatever. we were trying to have a peaceful protest and they fucking taser us..


this is freedom?

what freedom??


anyone else agree that that is fucked up?"

This Thursday, we need everybody to scrape by without spending one single penny all day. 
This is a huge movement around the US to strike a huge blow to corporate America on the day of Bush's inauguration. 
Do whatever you might the day before to prepare, but please don't spend a dime on January 20th. 
Imagine if the worst day for the American economy in decades happened on the same day that Bush spends $40 million to throw himself an inauguration party. 
It could send a huge message and grab headlines around the entire world. 
Band together to send the strongest message possible, the message of the almighty dollar!

If ya need something, buy it in advance. NOT ONE DAMN DIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","yeah... so after last night's fucked up entry i decided for a more uplifting update on the weekend. 

on friday i went to the show at beaumont ymca. sweetness. antons band was still amazing as ever. 
kelsey showed up even though she was grounded. i was so happy to see her but i almost wished she wasnt there because i knew she'd be grounded for longer. i love kelso. harrison showed up too. i was glad to actually see him because no sort of fighting and or bickering took place. 
some kid named austin ripped out my clevage ring. i was soo pissed. harrison and kelsey and jenna and i all went into the girls bathroom and stood talking until kristin the colourguard instructor came in. i hadn't see her for a goo long while since band season and she told me that she would look after me since she'd be seing me at the shows. yay.

i met a coumple ppl from hc. some guy dressed in black i sucked a skittle from his lips, and some guy that commented on my arms and said that he had scars too. sooo yeah. 

after the show luke chris jenna and i went and watched donnie darko. what a cool fucking movie. it was a little hard to get but it was seriously rad. (yes i said rad)
i went to jennas house where julia and jenna and i ate ovaltine milkshakes and watched napoleon dynamite. 

saturday we all ganged up again and went to rachels where we had a weird ass horrible non burning bonfire. woohoo. i got to get on a horsie! sweetness. 

on sunday i cam home and really did nothing. 

today i woke up and did chores and then went to lukes and hung out with shawn, then we went over to johnny's and listening to johnny spin his tables."

"event","goddess i feel so fucking sick. 
i think half a fifth of beam on an empty stomach was a little too much.
i wanted to drown away all the thoughts that kept swimming in my head.
now i'm swimming in my lonliness and i'm losing my little bit of grip on reality.

wait what reality?
i don't think reality really exists. it's just this horrible hell that people are stuck in for eternity. just an agonizing torture. that only drugs, alcohol or self harm deletes.


reality is merely a dream. nothing really exists. not you not me. not the blood running down my arm and thigh. not the smiling pictures of fond memoreies looking down on me from the walls. not the shadows that attempt to end my solace with their cruel dance upon my bed sheets. nothing exists. nothing was never ment to ecists. i'm nothing. i was never meant to exist. my mom told me i was an accident. i am the reason she fucked up her life. she had everything going for her and i fucked it up for her because if was born. i never asked to be born. i never asked to come into this world and suffer with what i have gone though. to be hated by everyone. to look the way i look, to talk the way i talk, to be who i am. this is one fucked up dream and i wish i could wake up. 

god i can taste him still on my lips and smell him on my clothes. i can't believe i want what i can't have. i always want what's beyond my reach. that's the point i guess. the most tempting thing is the thing that we cannot have. its like when your grandma puts cookies in a cookie jar and tells you not to eat one until later. that just makes you want it more. more more more. if she wouldn't have said that you probably would've waited until later. god fucking damn.

i woke up in the bath tub today. the water was so hot and so red. in the bath tub i layed for awhile. just thinking. i hate when i think. it hurts when i think hack to memories psat and remember who i am and where i came from. i sometimes sit back and watch people talk. happy people. smiling people. laughing people. and wish to be like them. i wish to be like them for just a minute. even a second. just to remember how it feels to be loved. to be wanted. to be saved. 

i can't feel that anymore. one too many times hurt i guess. i've built up a wall around me and i hurt myself everytime i want ot let someone in. now there's someone who's seen inside me and still loves me for me. i'm hoping that this is real. i mean as real as reality gets since reality is a dream. 

i take that back. i can feel it. i just won't feel it. if i feel it then my lows are just gonna get lower and lower and i'll sink back down to what i was. crying like a fucking kid. 

i did cry today. as much as it hurts me to say i did cry today. in that bath tub with my red bath wateri cried just for the fucking sake of crying. i felt so dirty when i wiped away the tears that streamed down my face. crying is just a vunerability. a weakness that i don't need and can't have. not if i wanna stay strong. 

the pain is numbing now. after so long i can't feel it anymore.

i'm so lost in my head. i wish i could get out but i doubt i'll ever find the way. i'm lost in my thoughts and my feelings and my wishese and wants and dreams. what is there anymore? 

welps of raised flesh have taken over my body. i cut just so i know that i still have control. sometimes i feel like i've lost my grip on reality and on my actions and my thoughts and me. 

i feel that way when i cut. out of control swipes of anger just to show myself that i do hate myself. i've been taught to hate myself. i've been force-fed the idea of hating myself. ever since i was born and breathing i've hated myself. my mom has, my grandma has. who hasn't?

sometimes i cut when i'm happy. just to tell myself that it is going to get worse and that my high is gonna go down. way fucking down. 

i wish i wasn't so lost. i wish someone was with me to show me the way but no one is there. no one is in front of me or behind me or even beside me. and why am i not suprised? why am i not suprised? why am i not fucking suprised?

i don't understand how someone could even look at me. let alone tell me that they love me. i'm beginning to lose my faith in love. maybe it doens't exist. if it does i can't find it and maybe it lost my address. 

i feel like such a horrible blemish on society. i hate myself and everyone hates myself and i wish i was someone else some place else. anyone anywhere. i just hate being me. sometimes i wonder if i did end it all would i become someone else someplace else. 

i'm fracturing. i'm bending and breaking and splintering and no one seems to notice.
'm so fucking broken and damaged and just by touching me i'll contaminate you with the fear of living. the fear of loving someone. the fear of getting hurt. 


i've had so much heartache in my life. if i have anyoother one i don't htink i can take it. 

i can't take much more. 

goddess i feel so fucking emo typing all this shit which no one will read which no one will care or comment or talk or feel or hear or think of my words. people only read words. they never feel them. can you feel the razor? smell the water? taste the blade? see the fear behind my eyes? do you understand anything that i type or write or talk or say? 




i feel so fucking alone."

today was the first day at henry clay. 
oh my fucking goddess.

i woke up at 7 ate breakfast went outside at 7:45 and got on the bus. 
after like 10 mins i got to henry clay. 
i know i'm just being stupid but that is a huge school to me. 

i got my schedule switched twice. now i'm in stlp, pre cal (which i don't know what the fuck is going on at all), ap us history, adv english 3, band, and spanish 2. 

i don't have anyfriends. at all. yeah. i'm really not too suprised or anything. i don't even eat lunch. i just sit by myself listening to the used on repeat.

i think i'll like it here. hopefully. 
i really don't want to go back to williamstown. ever.
i will miss my band though. that's the only thing i will really miss.
but don't tell them that. 

shawn is grounded from the computer. which is soo fucked up. he does have a couple bad grades. but who doesn't? 

kelsey hunni if you're reading this i heart you. i wish i could do something to make youfeel better. i'm sorry you're grounded. i really wanted to come and see you today after i talked to you. i heart you soo much. if i can ever do anything for you or if you ever need to talk to mre come and see me or call me or whatever.

harrison called me tonight. he was ultra weird. well when isn't he? he was making fun of my so called emoness.me? emo? puhlease. 

i think i am gonna end up going to the show tomorrow. 
i can't get a ride over to beaumont tomorrow from here. 
soooo.. i'm guessing that harrison and i are gonna go over to johnny's and get a ride over to beaumont. 

i'm not gonna be on tomorrow because i'm going to the show and then gong to jennas to spend the night. and i'm not gonna be on saturday cuz of the party at rachels. and i don't know about monday.
today was my first day at school in more than a month. i'm way behind and way fucked. 
yay expulsion. my mommy and grandma went to my other school and got my stuff. and since i am a concieted whore i had pictures of myself in it. sooooooooooooo my grandma and mom started crying. then all of the ppl that knew me started crying. i'm like wtf? that's really fucked up. but hey whatever as you like it.

i had an epiphany last night. 
i think that last night i gave up my faith in everything.

yes i know i am an attention loving bitch. 
and yes i did try to kill myself last night. 
and since i am typing this i'm obviously alive. 

i keep saying the wrong things at the wrong times. and being in the wrong places with the wrong people doing wrong things. everything i do is wrong. my life is wrong. i am a dissapointment and a screw up. 

i don't exactly understand why i didn't die last night. or why i even wanted to. 
at my funeral i don't want anyone to cry. anyone who decides to show up anyway. 

i just keep pretending that everything is alright. but it's not. it hasn't and never will be. ever.
this journal sounds so emotionless i guess but i really don't know how to feel anymore. or if i should be feeling anything at all. 

si isn't doing it anymore. drinking and whatever else i do. nothing is helping anymore. that's what i am though. nothing. 

my mom didn't show up to take me to court today so i can start at henry clay. this is day nmber 5 that i haven't been in school. i'm not even sure if i have to go to court for getting expelled or whatever. 

i'm really worried about things. 

maybe if i hold in everything. 
maybe it'll all go away. 
maybe i'll just disappear.
maybe one day.
maybe.

if you're gonna reply to this or anything. please don't pity me. i hate that."

the show at howlyn was amazing. antons band kicked ass. harrison and kelsey showed up which was erally weird. kelsey seemed so.. i dunno. just out of it. harrison is turning uber emo. he and shawn did an emo hair flip at the same time and they both sat side by side with their arms crossed and didn't talk. it was really funny.

hmm.. i think i am gonna go to the george bush protest on the 20th. i just gotta find a ride i guess.

yesterday i went to lukes and spent like 2 hours in shawns arms. it was really relaxing hehe. around 4 or 5 we went to the mall and ran around like a bunch of punks haha. we went and watched lemony snicketsa series of unfortunate events.  it was so ultra cute. johnny kept making fun of everything and jordan and harrison looked soo cute. hehe

we went to lukes dads after the movie and watched dazed and confused. jenna and i went back to her hosue and made ravaoli and ovaltine milkshakes and watched napoleon dynamite until we both fell asleep.

god i am gonna love it here."

"event","love is dead.
and if so... why do i continue to hate myself?

i've hated myself for a long time now. maybe tonights cutting frenzy was just my... realization that i will never be happy. and that i'll never make anyone else happy. happiness is just too far a reach away.
i've tried one too many times to be happy. i've tried one too many times to be loved to feel love. maybe i am better off dead. 

it just doesn't make any since to me. love, hate, happiness, sadness. whatever. everything is beyond my reach now. i can't even keep a grip on my sanity or my self control anymore. 

why do i have to hurt so fucking much?
i've actually gotten to the point where i'm cutting just because i can. 
maybe i am truly addicted to it. i want it more and more and all i can think about is a razor. 
maybe i do it to show me that my ""happiness"" is not really there. 
maybe i do it to show people that they can hurt me but i can hurt me more
maybe i do it just to do it. 
maybe because i can. 

the more scars that are on the outsice the more scars there are on the inside. my arms and thighs are cut with intricate slices that show everyone that i am as broken as they think i am. i've been through too much shit to give up on life. but i want to. sometimes i can hear my own euology in my head. 

my heart can't take much more disappointment. 
i find myself hesitant to let shawn see what i'm like on the inside
i regret letting harrison see because the heartbreak of him telling me that he hated me damn well almost killed me. 

i'm hoping for someone or something to hold on to. i'm losing my focus and my grip. my want to succeed is slowly fading away to nothing. it hurts too fucking much anymore. maybe that's the reason that i bleed. 

i bleed away all the disappointments, the love, the hate, the heartbreak, the sadness, the want, the hopes, the faith, i'm bleeding away everything. 

maybe there is no hope for me anymore. 
i've lost my faith in everything. 

someone please help."

i wish i  could stop cutting. i stopped for a while and now it's back again and it's really hard now. i can't just flat out stop again and now it's hurting me again. maybe i don't wanna stop but i really wanna at least slow down.

frankly he's my bony ass emo kid. damn metrosexual.

had a really weird conversation with harrison. he said he likes me or loves me or something but could never be in a relationship/friend with benefit thing because he knew that he wouldn't be the only one. i'm so confused on whether he likes me or not. god i feel like such a whore liking two guys. why must love be so fucking

"event","Hurray for vicodin!

yeah. i went to the emergency room this morning. i have a spider bite on my neck right on my JUGGULAR (sp?) vein. it hurts like a bitch. but they gave me vicodin and keflex. maybe it'll get better so they won't have to cut it open. 

erica is so mad that i'm moving to lexington. i'm so scared of getting down there and not having anyone. i'll have to get used to block and where everything is. hell i don't even know what school i'm going to yet.

i think i have officially given up on love. to me it doesn't exist. nothing really means anything. harrison found out i kissed/made out with shawn and he's uber pissed/jealous/doesn't care. i'm soo confused. geez. he says he loves me but he just wants to be friends and yadda yadda. i dunno. shawn doesn't like me and i know that. it was just fun to have someone i could connect to. maybe it's just me but i hate being lonely. i'm so scared of being alone for the rest of my life. it hurts to think of myself down in lexington being worse off than how i am here. 

my mom is going to school on wednesday and so is a whole bunch of parents whose kids have piercings. they're gonna go off on the principal. geez i dread this week.

hmmm... i feel like a whore because i like three different people. harrison (who already said he didn't like me enough to go out with me), johnny (who i like but is just really aggressive), and shawn (but i already read on his lj that he doesn't like me and he refers to me as the ""kayla girl."" oh well i guess i'll end up being happy sometime in the future. maybe a week. maybe a month. maybe next year. but it will happen sometimes. 

i'm losing my grip on everything now. it's getting harder to wake up. it's getting harder to hide the cuts that bleed profusely my broken dreams. i can't breathe at all when i'm drowning in the darkness that surrounds me. i'm fading from the surface choking on the water while trying to grab onto something to keep me afloat. it's impossible to keep it all in anymore. i told harrison i was going to keep it all in. now i'm just cutting more and more and more and the scars on the inside are worse than the scars on the outside. 



oh god someone please help me."

yep. you heard me out there in la la land. i'm moving to lexington. i'm not sure which school currently but i am.

sorry for the lack of updates but i spent the week in Lexington.

I left on Saturday night when sammy and larry came and got me. Woohoo aloneness!

On Sunday i did nothing at all but continue to breathe and watch the MADtv marathon

on monday i went and watched the Johnny's band rehearse. it was really good i did something after that but i soooooooooo don't remember what it was. 

on tuesday i went and watched the band rehearse again. harrison was there and he was being all overly protective and shit. i'm like wtf? i went with johnny to go pick up luke and evan and after they played for about 4 FRICKIN hours we were goin to the ky but since we had to drop eric off we went to mcdonalds and then to harrisons house where we ate and watched i-robot. (yay for sxe)

on wednesday i did nothing until johnny and luke and i went to the bellhouse. there was three really good bands. the swashbucklers, peticoat peticoat and sub rosa (johnny's band). luke and i got drunk and ran around. i sat on shawn's lap. shawn is pretty hot for a bony kid. (hehe) i'm sooo serious that you can see his ribs. he's sssssssooo totally ticklish. after the show we went to johnny's house where we all crashed out. 

on thursday i didn't do anything too intersting and on friday it wsa new years eve. Shawn came over to my house and we stayed there for like 2 hours and then went to lukes. from luke we went to arrons and then to matt kisers house. i drank bacardi 151+miller lite high life beer+ameretto all in one glass. nasty! we went to waffle house in John's car. yes JOHN's FAMOUS CAR!

how much do you think he spent on that car? 

$1 you heard me right! one dollar. and then he spraypaint tagged it to fuck yay! i passed out on matt kisers bed in the back bedroom and i made andrew scoot his ass over. hehe 


good thing number one: i got a new years kiss from an uber hot guy
good thing number two: i'm moving to lexintgon"

dane is perhaps the horniest canadian i know. ^^ lmao. he said that he wondered how many guys a chick could fuck at one time. he said dor me it'd be 7... if my ears were gagued to an equivalent to 4'... i was like wow... you acutlayy measured the diameter of your dick.. he just smiled and then went on about fucking.. wow...

anyway... i like pie. 

i have an extremely good possiility of getting kicked out  of school. due to me not talking out my piercings and not making my hair a natural colour. so i'll prolly end up moving to lexington.. yay...

OH MY FUCKING GODDESS. there is no such thing as love. i spilled my heart out and it got tore apart. i'm gonna cry so fucking much when i get drunk. I hate this. i hate liking someone so much it fucking hurts me. he doesn't realise it but i've been cutting because of him. i just wanted to remind myself it isn't as good as i think it is. and guess what? i was right. my life is hell. my life sucks. i hope i die. the end. of everything. of me. of my fucked up distorted existance. i hate it i hate it i hate it. whatever. i hate it i hate it i hate it. god damn everything to hell.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Somewhat Damaged

So impressed with all you do
Tried so hard to be like you
Flew too high and burnt the wing
Lost my faith in everything

Lick around divine debris
Taste the wealth of hate in me
Shedding skin succumb defeat
This machine is obsolete

Made the choice to go away
Drink the fountain of decay
Tear a hole exquisite red
Fuck the rest and stab it dead

Broken bruised forgotten sore
Too fucked up to care anymore
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care anymore

In the back off the side far away is a place where I hide where I
Stay tried to say tried to ask I needed to all alone by myself where
Were you?
How could I ever think it's funny how everything that
Swore it wouldn't change is different now just like you
Would always say we'll make it through then my head fell apart
And where were you?
How could I ever think it's funny how everything you swore would
Never change is different now like you said you and me make it
Through didn't quite fell apart
Where the fuck were you

Where were you all the times i cried and had no one to lean on?
where were you when i carved your name into my arm?
where were you when i wanted to kill myself?
where were you when i tried?
where were you when i screamed your name?
where were you when i turned down him for you?
where were you when i wanted to talk to you?
where were you when i gave up on love?
where were you when i gave up hope?
where were you when i had the needle to my arm?
where were you when he tried to hurt me?
where were you when he did?
where were you wheh i died?
because my last dying thoughts are gonna be of you
and how you forgot me. and threw me away. and how 
much you said that you cared and didn't. and how
many times you said i was beautiful and wasn't. all 
the times you lied to me and told me i was gonna be
okay? where the fuck were yoy? so you don't care? so
i'm not beautiful. i did cut. i cut for you. i cut 
because i knew that it's not real. all the things 
you ever told me were lies. why did you tell me 
any of that? why did you try to hurt me? was that 
your intention all along? to hurt me bad enough that
i would finish off the job? i've tried and tried over
and over. with a razor in my hand carving into my 
wrist. into my body. where your lips once were i've 
sewed away all the secrets.

I'm in a nin mood today. I did something VERY wrong yesterday and I fuckng hatemyself for it. if anyone wants to know i will im you leave a post if you wanna know- but i fucked up really bad. 

Minus that my life still is fucked. 
woohoo. life must be a nympho for fucking me over so many damn times. 
harrison hates me. i hate me. my mom, grandma, grandpa, yadda yadda insert other relatives hate me. anyone else wanna join the list?

I heart my clevage piercing. and my bridge. yay # 25 and 26.

i wanna die. i wanna die now with his smile in my mind. how he told me he wasn't interested in love. how he just wanted to be a kid. how he just wanted
what he couldn't have. i'm running out of places to hide the scars. to hide the cuts. to slice away what i thought could have been 'us' to burn it all away into a fading memory. i want to kill it all away. kill away everything.

splashing onto candles the room goes dim
she wished it idn't have to end this way 
there were still too many words left to say
even in the hot water she was chilled to the bone
in the biggest crowd she was always alone
she was the one that he'd finally break 
it was her innocence that he'd finally take
the bloody shard of mirror shattered as it hit the floor
the pain she kept inside no longer made her sore
fingers that used to grip the razor that tried
to hide all the pain she kept inside
now lay lifeless because their deed was done
her eyes closed death had finally won
so many times the though plagued her
the razor was the only way out the only cure
at her funeral he was the one left crying
picturing her angelic face as she was dying
she was the reason that she had cried
in his own pool of blood that night, he died.

his body against hers

he loves getting under her skin
to feel it all and not just a taste
he stole her purity, her innocence
he loves being in control
as he chains her to the bed

I went to the w.e.b.n. fireworks on September 2nd. I had just gotten home from spending the night at my friend Nathan's house and i went straight to the fireworks. It was scorching hot (which was odd), but since i had a pink plaid miniskirt and bitch knee boots. Well, when we were heading down the enbankment to our usual place beside the riverbank i passed 2 kids. One was a tall brown headed boy dressed completely in black with a acousic guitar in his hand and a girl with a red spaghetti strap shirt on. They caught my attention as i passed them on the way down the hill but i didn't pay them any special attention.I had alot of mud on my boots so i went and washed them off in the river. The boy was sitting on a rock about 200 feet from where i was. i washed them off and messed around joking with corey and andrew, sticking out my tongue and wiggling it around making fun of andrew. About 20 mins later the boy still hadn't moved. He sat on the rock and out of the corner of my eye i could tell that he looked over occasionally at me making a jackass out of myself. I walked up to him and caught him by suprise. I asked him if he wanted to walk since i was alone and he was alone. we walked around and i met his parents. his parents were mad at him because the girl had gotten upset when she had seen him with me. so he went to find the girl. about 20 mins later i found the girl and harrison came later. we exchanged 411 at the end of the day and i went on my merry way.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harrison and i kept in touch, talking to each other everyday almost and i talked to kelsey (the girl) every once in a while. i went down For the four day halloween weekend and i met johnny (that's the next link). Harrison got really incredibly jealous...

HALLOWEEN WEEKEND
Friday night i went down to Lexington and around 10 pm i went to the stadium and listened to one of harrison's friends (luke) band play. 
Saturday afternoon (around noon) i went to harrison's house where we hung out until around 3 when johnny showed up. harrison got incredibly pissed because johnny was hitting on me (playing with my feet, my hands and my hair). he eventually got over it and we ate dinner (crabs and steak). I got the living hell scared out of me by harrison's grandma who told me that ""you don't represent womanhood."" yay exactly what i need. after that we went to the rocky horror picture show. i got stoned out of my mind.
Sunday i showed up at harrison's around 6pm and we went trick or treating. i was drug around on a chain. really kinky. we went to kelsey's where harrison had fun painting me with uv paint. i spent the night there
Monday we went to harrison's and hung out doing basically nothing.
Tuesday i went to harrisons and hung out, there was some action in there but since i don't know who all is reading this thing i'm not gonna state any of it. I left around 10pm when paul came and picked me up.

This past weekend i went down to lexington again. On friday night we just ran around the mall and went to see ""the grudge."" It is the stupidest movie i've seen in my entire life. meowing asians? what the fuck was that director smoking? Saturday i went to his house around 3 and we had a replay of the halloween Tuesday, i got picked up by sammy around 2 and i left early sunday morning. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
I'm not sure what to think about him. He always tells me that i'm beautiful and i know that when i tell him that i love him i am being drug deeper and i'm going to get hurt. i know it in the back of my head that i am going to be hurt and it's going to be the most agonizing pain i'll ever go through. the funny thing is is that he is scared that he is going to lose me. him lose me? i think it is going to be the other way around. i'm going to lose him and it's going to kill me. it already hurts when i don't talk to him for a day, or don't get a letter, or don't see him. i miss his arms around me and his touch. guh. it's going to hurt. 
Yep johnny he says he likes me but i don't think he does. he may like me because he thinks i am an easy lay (*ahem* which i am not) or because harrison does? i dunno but it's just odd. no two guts have liked me at the same time...ever.

Nathan and i have lost touch. i met him at the grant county fair and we had something. it was a little spark i guess but we did have something. then he stopped calling. and he got a girlfriend. then he moved from walton to gallatin county. he still says i am the most beautiful girl he'd seen in his life but he hated being alone. well i hate being alone too damn it.
Kelsey is an interesting girl. she's just kelsey. she did give harrison head for her birthday. yep i did type that right. she asked harrison on her birthday if she could give him head. and he let her. i was seriously pissed off but hey i can't be a hypocrite and tell him what he can and cannot do with his body. guh. 
Pete is a sophomore at Carroll county. I went to an academic team match at carroll county last monday and his friend andrew came up to me and he said that i should talk to him. then pete came over. i seriously have to respect a guy that comes up and asks for a girls number. especially when that girl is me. i mean i'm not the prettiest or the smartest or the perkiest blonde bimbo. but he just comes right and asks me for my number. i gave it too him because i was pissed at harrison about the kelsey thing. i'd never tell it to his face that i was pissed but i was really mad that he let her do that. god maybe i'm being a control freak. pete is an extremely interesting guy. he has brown hair, plays the guitar, is on the academic team, he's catholic (but he accepts my religion so it's cool)he skateboards and he plays soccer. he's really really thin. i think i am gonna keep talking to him because he is really interesting and he's really good looking too 

Yep. harrison called me yesterday and he's mad at me over the whole cutting thing. i'm trying to supress it and it hurts. i mean it really hurts. i can't believe i started doing it again. i thought i was almost all better but no. i fucked it all up when i got mad at myself and cut again. i didn't tell harrison why i cut but it was because of him. i cut because i felt bad from making him feel bad. i don't know what the hell is wrong with me anymore. everything is going to shit when i don't talk to him or see him or feel him. i feel so damn alone. i'm alone when i'm in a crowd , in the hallways, with my friends. except him. god i'm going to get hurt. i'm falling in love and i wish i weren't. i can feel it in the back of my mind that it's all going to go to hell and i won't be able to take it. guh.</lj-cut>

dark thoughts and death wishes
slender fingers clutching the blade
into her pain she shall fade
she cut at her skin to forget
everything since they had first met
he stripped away her innocence
the divine falling from grace
faithfully she gave him her heart
now she reached inside to tear apart
the crimson river trickled down
she reveled in the solace she found
she hated him but hated herself more
she gave him her body, she was no whore
within the deepest depths of her crushed soul
she cut away the pain, she wanted to be whole
deeper and deeper, scar after scar
her one last time, he drove her to far, 
she slashed and slashed, fueled by hate
the razor she loved showed her her fate
she wished that she would die
her last words were bleed me dry."

"event","I have good news. I think i'm falling in love. 

I went to the webn fireworks and i met an amazing guy. His name is harrison and he lives in lexington. He's... there really isn't any words to describe him. He is so gorgeous, and he likes me. for me. no strings attached, no catches or anything, he likes me for me. Around here there is absolutely no one that likes me (like that). There's something about him that drives me insane. His look his touch, hell just about everything. I went down and stayed the weekend at my uncle sammys over halloween break. I stayed with harrison during the day. I think that i am getting in way over my head with him. I've always been unable to associate with anyone like i do him. I don't know anymore. I am afraid of getting hurt. Yes kayla is afraid of getting hurt. funny isn't it?

He makes me insane. I'm so scared to lost him because he is actually keeping me grounded. Funnily enough he feels the same way. He was a cutter and i stopped awhile ago. well i had stopped about a week ago i made him feel so damn bad i cut. There's a huge cut on my wrist and the word hate carved underneath it. I hate the way i am treated and i hate the way i seem to treat people. Actually due to my incredibly fucked up life i've grown to hate myself. I look at myself so negatively- i dunno. Harrison doesn't. He tells me that i'm so beautiful and that i have the sexiest legs. he's making me feel better about myself which isn't bad but i'll end up getting hurt. I just have a feeling i will.

During that halloween stay, harrison's friend johnny came over. Johnny likes me ALOT. and harrison got really protective. I mean he was JEALOUS. it was sorta funny to me because i had never been fought over before. it was a totally new experience. That weekend was the first weekend i had ever gotten totally fried before. it was actually funny. I went to the rocky horror picture show, and got drug around on a leash. i'm falling inlove and it hurts. it hurts me whenever i think of how lonely i use to be and how everything was shit. i wish i hadn't cut though. It was my fault for hurting harrison though... and what do i do? i hurt myself more. 

At the aademic team match this guy name pete came up to me. he knew my name and i gave him my number. it wasn't that i was pissed at harrison (okay at the time i was because i found out that a girl named kelsey gave him head) it was that i hadn't ever had someone jsut come up and ask for my number. he's from a really strict catholic family and it sucks for him. He's stuck in the boy scouts too. something to do with a car or something like that. he is uber cute though. he lives in carrollton and he turned 16 on nov 13. he likes the piercings- all of them (LOL) all 24 of them.

wow i make myself out to sound like such awhore.i like pete- pete likes me. i like harrison- harrison likes me. i like johnny(somewhat anyway- i like his hair) and harrison likes me. Wowie zowie what a whore. hmm... i dunno though i guess that i'm in shock that anyone likes me. i guess i'm somewhat stuck. 

I'm sorry i haven't updated this in a long while but with marching band and my lack of computer it's been hard. i'm moving in with gena now. since my grandma is moving back to pend. county i wanted to stay in williamstown school district (okay i really wanna move in with sammy who said he'd take me and go to dunbar with harrison but yeah) so i have to move in with gena. and corey is moving in with andrew.

What else has happened to me since i posted last? hmmm... crystal and i fixed things. things will never be like they once were but i am glad things have been patched up with her. Our marching band won the class a state championship. yay go band (with like oh my god so much enthusiasm). i keep writing alot so my next post will be a poem. or whatever the hell you wanna call it. 

I'm going to be applying for gsp (astronomy), gsa (creative writing) and a muarry state thing. Hopefully i don't totally suck and not get into any of them. well until later i'm off.

We got the opener on in two days(monday and tuesday). Yesterday was the day to clean it and today we learned the entire second song. I'm happy that this might be the one that takes us to state champs.

I'm crystal free. I'm actually crystal free. I'm glad i never listened to her trying to talk me out of doing band. *sigh of relief* I wonder what she's going to say when Gena and I don't let her sit at our table.

I haven't heard from erica in awhile. I hope she's doing okay.

Well sorry to keep it short but i'm going to get off of here and go lay in the band room floor and listen to my tool cd. I'm so tired and i've counted at least 37 bruises. Guh.

BTW.. i officially have 21 piercings. My tongue is wonderful and i love it. I've got a blue ball on it until i can get $$ and go get a five pointed star barbell that i seen at the flea market.

I'm 16 now. I've been 16 since july first and I've gone through nothing but hell since july first. I've gotten drunk got yelled at gotten a fifth of triple distilled vodka stolen from me. Went through a fight with a girl i thought was my friend. Yeah Crystal I'm talking to you. My life totally fucking sucks. Mike moved away, robert won't talk to me, i refuse to talk to crystal since she hacked my hotmail account and deleted the pictures she sent me and she deleted her addy from my messenger. I swear the cuts are getting deeper and wider and maybe one of these days i will hit a vein in the right spot.
I had the weirdest conversation with a couple of stoners. Andrew is a cutter and even though I am somehow the ""Cult"" leader of williamstown.. Andrew is the starter of all things painful. He's hot and i like him hell i'd admit it to anymone but things would never work out because of corey. Andrew is corey's best friend and since corey is older cuz to moi... well yeah you get the pic. 

I'm finally getting my letterman jacket and i counted that i officially have 20 piercings yay indeed. 

Erica i just thought i'd tell you that you're officially my only best friend since i was back stabbed by the lying two faced crystal. 

And oh yeah Crystal... Megan is a whore. Just thought you needed an approprate reality check. MEGAN IS A WHORE WHORE WHORE WHORE WHORE WHORE WHORE!!!!! YOU KNOW IT I KNOW IT SHE SURE TO HELL MUST KNOW IT IF SHE SAYS TO MIKE ""ALL YOU NEEDED TO DO WAS ASK ME IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE SEX!!""
I'm glad he didn't cuz he would have gotten herpes. hell even Jon said that she smelled so bad he just couldn't keep it or even GET it up!!

And finally to Megan... Live it up while you can fascist whore... you are one of the biggest whores i know and you still are you loose two dollar schissekof lot lizard.

Long time no see journal. 

I've lost a couple of pounds and my har is back black and blonde. I'm still the same old reckless me. 

AFter two years of not seeing him, i seen him again. Mike is back in Williamstown and it's drove me crazy. He's broke 5 sexbracelets and no matter how much i want to fuck him i can't. I don't know why but i can't. He played with my spots until i positively wanted to. but didn't. Then we (meaning tasha and i) went to the skate park where we met the 20 year old ronnie and I gave him a hand job and he fingered me. Go fucking figure. I don't know what hte hell is wrong with me anymore. 


Hmmm... Band is starting up next month. I can't wait. I'll get to see erica again and i can't wait. She's prolly pissed that i haven't been texting back but i just got minutes on my phone 3 houts ago. 

I passed with a 4.0 with honours again. yay go me. I'm so unenthusiastic right now it's not funny. Everyone expects that shit from me it's no suprise when i pull it off. 

I love mike so damn much. I'm fucking infatuated and i can't fuck him. All those times that i cried in his arms. All the laughing, blood, and tears. I just can't no matter how much i want to.. i just can't. It's fucking weird. I've ""overdosed"" twice and i ended up saying so really bad shit to him that i can't take back because i said it was true, and it is. I asked him what i told him and he said ""what you told me will just stay between you and i.""

That is good. Seeing that i probably told him i was raped and that i was born addicted to crank. 

I'm cutting again. I just missed it too much to stop. I stopped cutting for 27 days and i stopped smoking for 23. Now with my nerves shot with my damn grandma i am smoking and cutting again. Wow. I was so damn close yet so damn far. 

La la la.. off to sleepy land. I'll post again whenever i get ahold of a computer and some free time.

Gena for cuts and chris howard for everything and anything they could find, *sigh* thank god they didn't search me for cuts because they would have found a arm full of them... i'm so damned tired of everything that is happening at my school. I found out that to go into forensics you have to take a hair test and a lie detector test.. which means i am pretty much fucked. I wish there was some way so i don't fail that damn hair test but since gena made me smoke with her i've pretty much fucked up my future. 

Crystal broke up with fuckhead. and she started cutting. not to kill herself but just to cut i guess... fuckehead went out with a girl named shelly who has apparently gone to the psych. ward for cutting. How ironic... 

Mike is desprately wanting to see Gena. We snuck onto the property to return mike his movies and i made sure that gena kissed mike. she's feeling really vunerable and she thinks she'll have a miscarriagedue to Zach kicking her in the stomach. I know she is too young to havea kid and i'm sure that gena will make zach pay because she really wants a kid. *sigh*

Fuckhead stole scaupel (sp?) blades from the science lab. He took them home and the next day he got searched. I am so glad that i didn't get searched because i had my razors on me, WEll- he made ME of all people go put them back. and i did (although i took a couple for my scaupels).

I am so damned tired i think i am going to escape off to bed while i am able. I did get grounded for dying my hair red and black again but i really don't care. It doesn't seem important to me anymore what my grandma thinks because no matter what i will go behind her back and do it anyway. Hopefully all this fucking shit will change when i get my lisence. Yet....

I don't understand why all this shit is happening to me. I don't do anything that anyone can find out about and my grandma just goes off on me because people are talking. Hell i really don't know what i am going to do. Tomorrow night i'm going to sneak out of my momma's house and do see crystal, Gena-babes, mike and the rest of the gang. I miss them alot. I miss my clothes. I feel so dirty for cutting again but i feel so damned relieved. I just hope no one in the family finds out or i'll be sent off. I'm fucking sure of it. Why is black such a hated colour? Guh- i'll never understand. I'll just keep cutting to fill in the hole that she's dug into me. `

Today is the last day before spring break. I am indeed loved. I was talking to Gena about 10 mins ago and I found out why the other ""goth"" kids don't like me. It's because Jon and Rachael think that Chris Howard is lying about how he can levitate fire, just when no one is around. So Chris is a ""witch."" Or so he thinks. But the thing is I am a practicioner of wicca. So those two think that i am also lying. And rachael thinks that I have visions. LOL. And I also found out why Cameron hates me. It's because when she was dating Chris H. someone had came up to her and told her I was fucking him. Damn I want this all to fucking stop right now. But I really doubt that is will.

It's been 9 days, 21 hours, and 32 minutes since i've cut. I'm somewhat happy. But i am dying for a razor. 

I'm trying to figure out what i am going to do with my free spring break time. Erica, crystal, mom, grandma, gena, chelea, yadda yadda yadda... hell i dunno.

I had cut the night before and the cuts were bright against my pale flesh.She pulled me through the hallways and into the nurses office where i got a lecture, then to the office where I saw my best friend (Gena), my boyfriend (mike), my friend (matt) and this bitch named holly who had told on us. She had been caught and decided to rat us four out. We all four (gena, mike, matt and i) all knew eachother do it and it just went bad. WE were al smart enough to say that we had we didn't know that eachother cut and that was enough. I was immensely pissed. I was escorted home by the nurse and she talked to my mom. And guess what? My mom knew my mom fucking knew. After the nurse left she asked to see my arms. She ran her fingertips lightly over it and said i understand. 

Friday night after school someone had told my grandma who has custody of me, that i cut. She has threatened to send me off to Onita, a private catholic reform school. I hope i don't go because if i do i am running so fucking far away it's not funny. Mike broke up with me after that. It's not that he didn't like me but he just couldn't date me due to his parents xtreme dislike of how i look.

Guh. I want to cut so bad right now but i am wondering if i should risk it and cut. I'm so close and my racors are too. I can't go this long without a razor. It's fucking impossible. 

Has anyone else been caught and still cut? Any advise? Someone please comment just to let me know that someone understands me.

Firstly I have a boyfriend. I think I am actually in love. I hope i don't get my heart hurt of get fucked over by him-it just feels weird actually hving someone to connect to. He's a cutter and weare both trying to slow it down. Not stop but just slow down. I also changed my hair. No more pink hair for me but instead all of it except my bangs are black and my bangs are red as well as underneath. Cha ching. Mike (the bf) is about to dye his hair blue. I am going to laugh so hard at him running around in a 6 inch mohawk with blue kooliad dripping down his face. 
I'm addicted to his tounch i think. I always feel so safe around him and I thik ive actually found a place where i belong. I mean I actually get along with people. Of course they go throught the same bullshit i do so we do tend to get along. The goth-freaks as it is. Mike also pierced his septum and i think i will do the same- just another thing to have in common.
Crystal took me to see ""dawn of the dead"" it's a fucking awesome movie and i was so impressed. Chelase may be preggie by David- that STD fucker and i swear that if she is i am going to kill him. 
My mom told me something the other day. She has syphillus- ?- I was like wtf mom... you're dying.

I cried yesterday so much that my mom yelled at me and threw me out. I felt so dirty because i couldn't help crying. My grandpa came and picked me up from outside and took me home. I felt so FUCKING dirty that I had to take a shower and I just couldn't get the blood off. It was so fucking scary i took a razor to my skin again- and i tried to scrape the dry, caked blood from my arms (I had hidden my arms from everyone because i had on a long sleeved shirt). I really thought I was losing it. 

*sigh* I was really really hoping that erica would find me a date to the sweetheats but she didn't and that's ok... i don't think she would wanted me to be there anyway. I'm shunned everywhere I go- so i don't think that up there in Fort Thomas would be any different.

I really need a guy. I mean really. I need someone I can relate to and I really doubt that I can find one in my school. I doubt is as much as i doubt anything....

Supposedly someone brought a gun to school on Thursday to kill the stupid fuck who said that glenn deserved to die. I wish they (whoever it was) would have killed that stupid fuck because all the lunch ladies are now making sure he isn't killed in the lunchroom.

On the oh so very upside I decided that I am going to be forced to go to eku. I'll majour in Forensic science and I'll minor in photography... I wish it could be the other way around but alas my mom thinks that being a photographer is a waste of my life. 

Oooh yes. Also I pierced my nose today! It's a diy thing of course and I, hoping that I can go and get my middle bottom lip done one of these days but then i couldn't play my sax- which would interfere with many MANY aspects of my life right now. Guh.

Picks coming soon.

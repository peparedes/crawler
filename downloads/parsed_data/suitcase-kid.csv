<P><FONT color=#339999>wow. that saturday was one of the best times of my life</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#339999>so me and lil walked to michelles we made raviolis and gascon and brian came over again. we hung out for a couple hours then they had to bounce. michelles sister came and picked us up and we wrote on the back window of her car with a car marker ""BAD GIRLS ON A MISSION... TBS"" and then on the side windows ""IF WE GO DOWN, WE GO DOWN TOGETHER"" it was great. it took us a while to get&nbsp;there but we like raced these guys the whole way and listend to our music to get pumped. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#339999>FINALLY we got there and the line was seriously like 3 blocks long. carazy. me and lily went and hid my camera in a bush bc they wouldnt let us bring them in and there was the sexiest thrift store. so yes we got in there and waited like a millon bagillion minuets there was 3,000 people! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#339999>finally the first band came on. a thorn for every heart. they were pretty good the crowd was just like gaaahh how long is this gona take.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#339999>&nbsp;then matchbook came on and it was so soooo awesome. Me and my lil michella were like singing with these 2 guys next to us i loved it. we got split from lily and mandy bc of the crowd shiftyness.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#339999>then fall out boy came on. this nasty guy or girl we dont know&nbsp; smelled like poop and was wearing a hoodie was in front of me and lil and it was like the grosest thing ever. he was soaked with sweat.&nbsp;eeew so we went away from him. they were jammin,&nbsp;it was hot, i called my bro during grand theft autumn bc its his favorite song in the world. we met a bunch of like seniors and saw a buttload of people from school.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#339999>BLAAHHGHGHGHGHGHT THEN TAKING BACK SUNDAY CAME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAYYY. so yeah me lil and michelle all like got way close bc we wanted to be in there hardcore. haha so we they started and it was crazy. oh jeez. everyone was going&nbsp;loco and we kept getting thrown into moshes. our arms were hooked so we wouldnt get split up. it was great, singing with everyone. but seriously it was so funny bc we like were rocking out hard with all these guys and screaming at the top of our lungs. taking back sunday is like the world to us. god i love them so much. it was the best time. oohhh then like these 2 power machine men haha lifted lily up to crowed surf and then they kept askin me so i actually went!! haha it was great, i was all up there and shit then i fell head first into like this whole of people. i was like staring into a tunnel of light with all these people around me picking me up. so then after i got up another girl who was crowd surfin like got thrown on my head wich knocked us both down. after this guy who loooked exactly like MJ from the real world picked me up to crowd surf again and i made it to the very front in the&nbsp;hands of the&nbsp;security guards.later on i realized how&nbsp;it would have been better to just stayed in bc we were so up there.&nbsp;so then i was sepparated from lily and michelle and everyone else and i actually went back into the crowd by myself. i was so proud i was just in there being pushed around by with everyone. hardcore haha. but it was all good bc me and tbs connect like that. i would climb a mountain for them. they even played 2 encores. &lt;3</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#339999>today we went shoppin for michella's homecoming dress. its muy purty. we talked about the concert like non-stop. we have the ""after concert feeling"" where like its all you can think about and you just wish you were back there. and everytime you do think about it, it puts a smile on your face. haha</FONT></P>"

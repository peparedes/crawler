I wish i could have gone
I wish I never said things
I wish people would stop hating on your good times
I wish I could make everyone happy
I wish I had more time 
I wish things didnt get this far
I wish growing up was eaiser
I wish people would see they do the samething they hate that people do to them
I hope I have learned from everything that is happening
I hope i never live for the future but for the moment
I hope you find what your looking for in those pills
I hope you learn a better way to deal with life
I hope in days you forgive me and we can be freinds


I wish and hope that everyone will know what its like to be able to know its all ok just with a kiss."

"event","so tonite has been weird.  there is this friend of mine that i have that i have known for years and years.  Well he started dating this girl and then all of sudden she hated me because he was going to give me his old red shorts sweater.  Well at least thats what i thought it was.  well the guy and his girl are always  off and on and well when they are off  I hang out with more and well one thing led to another, but she doesnt know about that.  well today her and this girl who hates me even though we were best freinds in high school, but  she became a horror and fucked all my guy freiends who i knew longer,  they both saw me and went into the bedroom.  I have never met someone who hates me as much as my freinds girlfreind.  I mean this girl probably has thought of me often because she hates me so much.  Like what she would love to do to me and shit.  well she started talking shit to me because i said i guess yall still hate me.  Like she was pissed, i saw the anger in her eyes.  If it was just some random fight i would have had a chance, but this bitch hates me.  she said i said i wanted to suck her boyfriends dick......i dont know whats she talking about, the only time i can think i would have said that was way before they even hooked up the very first time.  She got mad because i was like im just chillin im sorry you stilll hate me.  Trying to help her get over me.  I mean this bitch is a mother now and shit and she was telling rj to not stand up to me and he said he hates me and all this other bullshit.  the same old game homeboys play when their chicks hate their homegirls.  Finally i was like im going to go because im too old for this high school shit.  she got mad slammed the door in my face locked the door then opened it again and  started to walk behind me.  she was like leave bitch if i ever hear you talking to my man im going to kick your ass.  I was just like im sorry you have spent so much energy on hating me and i wish the best for your family.  then she started calling me dyke and stupid lesbian, i was like those words dont mean shit to me. then her and the other girl watched me get into my car while i smiled and said bye.  man i feel kind of honored in a way to have someone have spendt so much energy on me.  When jon gets out and im always hanging out with him and rj is with jon too, she will love that.  I mean ok dont like me, but please get over it.

then i got really high with her boyfreind after she left, they called me to come back over and get me high to say sorry."

"event","I came home very sore and tired.  Took a shower and noticed all the brusies i had and where i was really sore at.  I had a lot of fun.  I was at the front almost the whole concert but i started to get weak so i need to get out and get some water.  It ended like 10 mins after that.  I should have just stayed up there the whole time.  I was right on the railing for deftones and near the pits for posion the well and denali.  It was awesome being so close to chino.  My freind from san antonio was there and he brought along this cute boy with dreads. I lost them right when the deftones came on, it got really crazy.  It was way more crazy for them than posion the well.

All in all it was a fun times."

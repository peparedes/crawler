"event","How come all these beings who consider themselves of higher power feel the need to cleanse the earth? If it's really as bad as they say it is, then why not let it rip itself to shreds. I really don't see where people get the idea that <i>they</i> have the authority to ""cleanse"" the Earth.

As far as I'm concerned, they're only bored people who only have way too much power for their own good."

"event","The Staff of One is making a fuss. It doesn't seem to want to cast any spells correctly, and it keeps <i>talking</i>. I'm used to it helping me, but now it's like it's constently in my <i>head</i> or in my <i>soul</i>.

I'm worried. Things have been known to go from bad to worse, and if this is ""bad"", I really don't want to see what ""worse"" is.

And I have a headache. <s>Maybe I should steal some asprin or something.</s>"

"event","I think... some really bad stuff is happening right now. I'm not sure what. There's allot of talk about ""portals"" and these shadow things, and castles that don't exist? I'm really not sure what's happening, but it's probably worse than the civil war going on right now. <s>Fuck, my team probably really needs me right now...</s>

It's times like these I really want to be back with my makeshift family.

Also, people who are dead are apparently coming back to life. I'm worried this might mean we'll see the <i>real</i> Alex soon. I really... can't deal with seeing him again. I <i>really</i> can't. The scare with his dad was enough."

"event","Okay, so I figured out a spell to get me out of Thailand back to LA (or, at the very least, America). But then... I'm not sure what happened. Maybe I didn't have enough... whatever to complete it, or to keep it going until I got there. Whatever the reason, I'm now in Japan. I'm pretty sure of this because I landed in the JAL or whatever, and it said, in big letters ""WELCOME TO JAPAN"".

It's really frustrating. I managed to find a recite and a pencil, and I've figured out a spell to send it to Gert. I just hope it <i>works</i> this time.

I hope ""any means necessary"" doesn't mean eventually contacting the likes of the Avengers or X-Men for help. If anything, they're a last resort."

"event","I'm a little freaked out here.

Last thing I did was go to sleep, back in The Hostel. And it was pretty hot. Liveing under the tar pits and all. So I went to bed in my underwear.

And now I'm not in The Hostel. In fact, I'm not very sure on <i>where</i> I am. The Staff of One had allready gone inside me and everything, and I didn't have a toothbrush handy, so I had to make a shank so I could get it out and cast a ""get-some-cloths"" spell. Let's hope I never get into a predicament like this again.

I swear to God, if Chase is playing some sort of sick joke on me, I am kicking his ass like he wouldn't <i>believe</i>."

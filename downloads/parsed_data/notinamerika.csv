As they are, but none the less they are drastically changed and i am exceedingly stationary. i cant imagine but i can. putting myself on a cold street somewhere in bosnia, barefoot, poor, yet finding motivation to live every day. because there could be something better, but probably unlikely for me to ever have it. Speculation. staring, almost certainly neutral, sitting and alloting consciousness of the life chosen, and the life not chosen.

I talk a lot of shit, undoubtedly. I talk, which is shit, undoubtedly. And this accumulation of crap ive slotted to talk about is very much laughable, in some respects. but it is something of an endeavor, something that could create something from nothing. this is no pulitzer winner, but it is something. and you could take something from it, if not nothing than knowing someone elses side other than your own. people need to be themselves, to actually be. not just hold back and sheild themselves from ever being known for fear of being let down. there is not enough faith esteemed in people, among themselves, among others, to grant them the atmosphere to be as they will. instead we have pressure, and anxiety, and fear, selfconciousness, and the like. i dont know where im going with this, i never do, it never matters. this will end, the select individual(s) that find themselves reading this will think something to themselves (now, you) and go ohhh this or hrrmm that. and you are no further or behind in your life, just a blank screen. this isnt so much negativity as wondering where anything is taking me, and if it isnt bringing me where i want what is, and why arent i doing more of it... i dont know about people, what is the malfunction"

""The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this.""  Now this, my select readers, is very similar to what marijuana laws are doing in this country. And let it be known that Einstein said those words, and let it be known to all around thee that he is a badass, and his words are better than yours. And seriously, he is right. so go to hell america, im smoking my pot."

I walk around school and i watch people and i listen and observe. all these differences in what is going on in many ways and its so complex yet so systematic. its a curious nature of humans to duplicate each other. words like common exist because so many repeat or reflect each other. learning through observation teaches these repetitive traits, and at the same time it serves to teach me the deoth to which it goes. and im thinking about what kind of blinders have we been equipped with in a subtle fashion. what observations did we come to inherit as our own behavior and in what way are these limiting our 'vision'. Dont imaginations still reserve some boundaries no matter how free the thinker. These things that we cannot readily percieve with our intellect are only to remain hidden so long as the implications of our mimicry arent reflected upon.

"event","in a world where countries are led by the ignorant, what is a pacifist to do? Trying to be reasonable to the reason-less is proving more difficult with 'time'. i ask myself what will be worse; war or  revolution. A war might give a country what it had in mind from the beginning, or the ends, and be happy with that. Their war is a 'necessity' and the ends justify the means. Nevermind the small loss of life, the world has been saved. Somewhere in this an indirect notion that one casualty is better than two; two better than three, and so on has been derived. The world as a whole is placed before one and I ponder why. To assume that brand of 'thinking' implies a self-righteous point-of-view. One or many has to make that executive decision to deploy forces, understanding the inevitable losses that will result. I wonder if the people making decisions would reason the same if they were one of the deployed if that decision is made. Where does this lack of consideration of anothers life come from? you find it in the death penalty. you find it throughout the governments practices. infact, a government is sometimes defined as a body created to preserve the greater good of the whole. What is it that makes up this whole but each and every individual? And even before we are countrymen or clergymen, we are HUMAN. All to be had is this experience and there are those who are in power to take all that is YOU so that they can keep theirs. And whats scary is people like you and your parents and their neighbors voluntairly elect and support people who exercise these powers. And what is someone like me to do, born of this country, born of this world, but at all times being a pawn to their ideals? Revolution."

Can there be thought without existence...or existence without thought. And which would be superior...to exist as we do or to live as animals, for all we know, unconcious of what we 'know'.

I also havent eaten since i woke up so i bet this all plays a factor. my head feels kind of numb. the thoughts that i can usually play out arent willing to come out today. I feel like maybe im half-concious. my fingers are slightly jittery. I went to a concert wednesday. saw xzibit, xecutioners, papa roach, ludacris, and eminem. it was at hifi buys ampitheater aka lakewood. i was in the unusual position of having bubba sparxxx, andre 3000 from outkast, scarface, and eminems manager Paul Rosenberg stand right infront of me during most of the show. That does not happen to anyone too often. I left them alone though a shitload of people felt like bothering them. I know they just want to chill so i let them. But anyway it was cool to cross paths with people who lead much different lives. Here i am, some broke ass nobody kid who lives with his parents, still in highschool, doing nothing and pretty much just existing. There they are, able to skip city to city, rosenberg having that house in the hamptons(he does, seriously), meeting people and doing things ive never done. Im just another kid in that huge lakewood crowd to these guys. and its not that i want to be more than that, its that i know i am more than that. and they dont. i want to be on the other side of things sometime. it is about time i make some serious contributions to myself. that is, i want to tap into what it is ive got in my head and make something with it. i need expression and i want to put myself in a better position. i want to focus my efforts on maybe music or some creative flow. ive seriously contemplated leaving everything that i know here. just leaving alone and not coming back soon. i feel like there is a need for change in my life. A shift in direction...not to say there is somewhere to go. But with all this time i feel it is a necessity that i do something more productive. I had to answer this questionaire thing at my school upon enrolling and it asked something like ""what in your life do you feel most proud of?"" and i thought and thought. I was never able to answer that and i still wonder why......."

                                     The song recounted the true story of four post-Civil War

                                     privates under the command of white brass, who fought for a
                                     quarter century against the Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa,
                                     Apache, Ute and Sioux. In the end, fourteen key black
                                     campaigners, whom the Indians had dubbed ""buffalo soldiers,""
                                     were awarded the Medal of Honor as part of a public relations
                                     move to justify and glorify the genocide of Native Americans,
                                     underlining the U.S. government's policy of manifest destiny. Such
                                     were the ploys that, then as now, comprised the politics of
                                     neutralization. 
 Here i sit and think. This only furthers my justification for why America isnt where i want to be. I dont stand for that at all. The mighty greenback says i trust in god. In God We Trust. I want to scream no. It is a lie and nothing less. Theyve got no right to speak for me, so i must speak for myself. I want to unite with you people, i really do. It is something i hope we can accomplish someday. I have love for all and i dont judge a one of you. I cant prove God doesnt exist...and you cant prove he does. Its up in the air. I leave it that, honestly. And thats why i laugh at those who stand there and tell me they KNOW God exists. Its not that i know they are wrong, its that i know they dont know that. There is just no way to know. Philosophy has taught me that. Thank you Descartes. I mean ive come to question even more. What is the self? what is this ''I'' that i speak of. The connections between the mind and body. I mean Descartes was bold enough to consider that he doesnt know what he thought he did. Break things down, ask yourself the most basic of questions. I no longer want to tell people how things are...i want them to see it for themselves. You cant be taught how to be intellectual...it must be discovered within. There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path. So i leave it up to 'dem. If i write a book, will any of you read it"

Also what she doesnt do, sometimes. I do not judge. And i am no source on any matter. But i am a thinking individual. I read this persons life and i think. They arent completely like this. I am, in a lot of ways, ignorant to much of what makes this person them. I do know their mentality though, some of their thought processes, and i see how deep their mind can go as of right then. Their limitations are exposed, as mine are im sure. What i see is someone who is not enlightened. I am just in my infancy of being enlightened if you will. But leap and bounds is that birth, by which compared to others. I beg you, people, THINK. Read. Use reason. Read. Read. There are so many things for the thinking mind to do. To think you know anything is hard to actually prove to yourself. We think we are right more often than not, but its the other way around. To say you dont value learning or education or thinking is absurd. To say that is to say you accept that others will control your life. Not like a puppetmaster. Not so obvious to the untrained mind, the unconscious brain. The more intelligible will win out because that is what gets them there, knowledge. thinking. reading. I cant make you want it, you must think and see the light. You must conclude that knowledge is important. That the tool between your two shoulders does not dull and rust in the shed. Keep it sharp, too sharp. Let the other tools dull, they wont live such a colorful life as you. They will sit in the darkness, while you spend your days in the light, being used like you should.

That being said, I woke today to find out my dad was in the hospital. He almost had a heart attack and his artery is 99% clogged. He must have an angioplasty done to fix it.I have felt strange today. Hoping he would be alright. He had a heart attack once when i was in 4th grade. I am not ready to lose my father but I know he is getting old. You never know when people will die. I dont think that is a good thing. It is odd to know one day i wil be alive and my parents will not. My whole life so far has had them in it. And sooner than I want they will be gone. I have mixed feelings about people thesedays. I am very easygoing and not an ass too much yet i get the full bitch out of people. My actions dont warrant the shit but I get it nonetheless. Let it go people. I am pretty confident ill never connect with a female, make sense to them on any intellectual level. Women and men think so differently. They can decieve you for a while, make u think they use reason to rule their life. But soon u realize they are very emotional people, whether they realize it or not. My life isnt free of emotion, no doubt, but it doesnt come out when theres no purpose. I dont carry an attitude onto people who did nothing to me. I sound like i am whining probably, but I am just trying to point out dumb shit I experience. No one reads this and im not sure it would be liked if it was. I think too much. Opinionated u could say. If u dont conform to others just a little it poses a problem. There has to be some kind of compromise. Yes i have many opinions but that doesnt make yours any less. I dont make things out like that. I dont take shots. I justask questions, pick peoples brains, and they dislike me for it. I like to know things about others. Their justification for why they do things. Like why do girls wear makeup. It is by no means a need. It is a want that is forced by others. Our inability to be ourselves sucks. Sooner or later im going to seem fucking crazy. But ill simply be being myself more than now. I can get tom green strange. That man is crazy funny. He kills me. Unleash the fury, mitch. I am torn between my thoughts. I seek to find a point in something. I just want to not have to deal with some things alone, though it doesnt bother me all that much. I dont want to die alone is what i am saying. May the force be with you..."

"event","I feel like there is no hope. It is just me against the world as 2pac would say. My friends attempt at defending his beliefs in god are so weak. In the two hour argument or whatever he failed to make many points. He is the type of person who tries to comment or add some bit of knowledge to any situation. The best part is he does not know what he is talking about. But he will still try to be all factual about it. His research is limited to um, little to nothing. Yet his conviction remains. I dont feel like i know much of anything to be 'matter of fact' anymore. Sure i think i know but by no means have i checked up on most of the shit. I would like to say things with the utmost confidence. I want to tell you how it is and be sure of it. I think ive got it to some extent now, compared to others(everything is relative). For being classified as a dumbass i am well thought out. Maybe too much. Or not. My friend was just a lack of thought. Making sense is 70% of an argument. If you dont make sense you are not going to win. There must be facts. The undeniable kind. Or atleast the uncontested. And no one knows what facts are anymore. Philosophy teaches us what true knowledge is. It isnt something that is easily attained. Some of my best conclusions about life are: 
-No matter what IT DOESNT MATTER(im talking ANY situation at ANY time. Our lives are insignificant. so many countless lives before us and OURS is supposed to mean something? thats just it...it doesnt matter) 
-Question everything. People keep doing the same things in life. I refuse to believe we all want the same thing. We are all so different yet we accept so much out of laziness. Life doesnt have to be like it is made out to be. You dont have to have kids, own a home, and drive a minivan. Of all the possibilities, that one is settled on. What the fuck! Seek what YOU want and live it. Dont buy into things so blindly. The things we do are not necessary and dont make life. recognize these things.

Thats all i feel like disclosing on that. Ill write a book or two granted i live long enough. Lakers won...3peat BITCHES. Shaq Attack. I want to play pro ball. What an easy living. Doing something I do out of interest, out of love. It isnt just a guy thing. I saw christian at the Y yesterday. I have a strange affinity towards her. Looking at her alone is thought provoking. Shes hot. And damnit if i talked to her all school year and got nowhere. She knows but she doesnt. Shes got the idea but i dunno, for some reason i have thought about her. Odd, these fixations we have. Though i wouldnt call it that. As different as our minds are, i feel like she is still someone i could be with everyday. The future scares me in some ways. It is so foggy, unclear. Do i die in 4 years...will i hit it rich...will i go broke and on the street?. I think i will still be alone in the future. I can handle it, but if i could choose, i wouldnt be alone. But thats what life is. The big fucking question mark. A mystery unraveled. Ive spent 20 some odd minutes writing this. Hopefully it was time well spent. Im sorry to hear you are not satisfied with your life, Savannah. I, too, am not satisfied. Who can be in a world like this. But i find satisfaction in getting what i need. In the end, thats all that gets us there. Food, clothing, shelter. It is all that is necessary for our survival. Human beings are peculiar animals. If we only didnt have a brain things would be so much better. Ignorance is a way of life. let me kno if this is getting read. Im not sure it is."

I&nbsp;have six inches or more of snow outside my window, and five&nbsp;more days of this coming. I&nbsp;can't wait for summer.&quot;&nbsp;<br /><br />The rationale behind this thought is that I&nbsp;have Raynaud's Phenomenon. This is a circulation problem that leaves your extremities completely at the mercy of the cold. Although it isn't a big deal for most people that have it, it is for me. I&nbsp;have primary Raynaud's, which manifests a bit worse than secondary, and the other notable difference is that primary Raynaud's is a stand-alone condition, there isn't a bigger problem that's causing the circulation issues. The slightest coolness or even stress can cause an attack of Raynaud's. There isn't medication for it, so all I can do is take cinnamon and niacin for circulation and bundle up. <br /><br />My normal winter get-up is pretty&nbsp;comical. If you have seen <em>A Christmas Story</em>&nbsp;remember the scene in which the boys are bundled up so heavily they can't lower their arms. Winter wear isn't far from that for me. Factor in that my job is half outdoors, stocking cold&nbsp;sodas and beer&nbsp;in ill-insulated sheds that are not climate controlled and that one of my co-workers is on heavy medication that causes her to overheat if the mercury hits forty degrees. Imagine a blonde gal swinging open both the doors on the tiny convenience store (due to poor construction they're directly across from each other, no more than twelve feet or so between them) and she's flushed red with heat, hanging out of one of the doors, facing into the biting wind with her eyes shut in pleasure as snowflakes the size of quarters and half-dollar coins fall on her skin and immediately evaporate. Yes, that is steam!&nbsp;Meanwhile, I am dragging an exposed cart of cold product across the parking lot in my marshmallow suit, and thinking of curling up in front of the heater in the back office. <br /><br />I hate the cold.<br /><br />Truly. <br /><br />In the parched, searing hot summers we get in the high desert I&nbsp;spend my free time laying on large, smooth expanses of bedrock sunning myself like the snakes do. Even in the early part of fall, the breeze is only enough to be refreshing and I&nbsp;can relax in a patch of sunshine in the windowsill. In the our soggy spring weather it's often all I can do to stay warm enough to move, but I&nbsp;hang in there with a lot of hot tea and a few good books. In fact, come to think of it I'd miss the other three seasons if it was summer all the time. Half the fun of summer really is the anticipation, however cliche it may sound. So keep it coming, Jack Frost. It just makes me appreciate the summer heat even more."

"event","I made and printed a bunch of new resumes yesterday, since I'm still job-hunting. Today I came home after babysitting and Terry wanted to see the resumes. 

Now I realize she's over twice my age and knows what she's doing usually. But she's also drunk as soon as she gets home pretty much every night. And she really shouldn't correct my spelling, of all things. That's one thing I usually do rather well at. She tried to tell me to call the cash drawer a ""til"" instead of a ""till."" For one thing her spelling is a shortening of ""until"" and is missing an apostrophe. *headdesk* I realize us ""young people who think we know everything because we DON'T"" are annoying, but so are older people who think they know everything and try to beat us over the head with it. Ugh. 

I've written my own resumes before and done well enough, and considering the whole till thing I figured it was best to ignore her advice. She took a pen and started scratching out everything she didn't like on my resume and writing new things on there and generally picking it apart. It's one thing to do that with my creative writing-- that, at least, I can understand. People have creative differences, sometimes the flow isn't right, sometimes there are plot errors, etc. But my <i>resume,</i> for God's sake? 

I almost told her straight to her face, ""You're so drunk you can hardly speak, and you're criticizing my resume?""

And I've been working on a seed bead choker on my loom. It's a beautiful design that more or less honors the old myth of Raven stealing the light.

One is too pale, one is too cheesy, and the other the beads are wider than all the other seed beads I'm using. *headdesk* It's frustrating me because I could be done with it by the end of the week if I had the right beads.

"event","I haven't felt like writing in quite a while, maybe almost a year. Right now, however, I would KILL to have my RAM drive from my old computer so I could work on some old stories I had started on it. I asked my brother if he'd send it to me, but he never answered me, so I'm guessing that means he and Johnny (my cousin) adopted it for online Battle for Middle Earth fights. Bleh. 

I may wind up using my LJ for a story/plot dump-bin for a little while. 

Also, I have a lovely t-shirt with a Native American theme-- well, I have a few of those, but this one has a raven with a totem-style sun in his talons. I love it, because it's centered around a Tlingit myth about how the sun, moon, and stars came into being. 

Basically a greedy little old man was keeping all the light in the world in a box within a box within a box buried in layers of boxes. Raven found out about this, and transformed himself into a hemlock needle when the old man's daughter went to fetch water from a river, and floated into her basket. She became pregnant, and being a shape-shifter Raven turned himself into something that would easily pass for human in the dark. His ""grandfather"" was extremely affectionate, as grandparents generally are, and eventually gave in to the Raven-child's tantrums and let him have the outer box. After a while, Raven had quite a few of the boxes and eventually talked Grandpa into letting him hold the light for just a minute. Of course, as soon as he had it, he transformed himself into his normal Raven self, flew off with the light, dropped it, and it shattered into two big pieces and lots of little shards-- the sun, moon, and stars. 

Point being, it's an awesome myth and I always thought it would be kinda cool to get a small tattoo of Raven carrying the light. I'm considering actually getting this tattoo when I get my tax returns. 

And I need to find my notebook and do some writing...."

"event","<p>Last night I scared the bejesus out of everyone. I left a&nbsp; note saying I'd gone for a walk and would be back by 4 in the morning or thereabouts. I left the house at 2. I had underestimated how upset I was. I couldn't bring myself to turn around and head home when 3 rolled around, not even after the sheriff pulled me over and asked if I was okay or needed a ride. I couldn't bring myself to go home, or call any of my family to pick me up.&nbsp;<br /><br />I walked right out of town.&nbsp;<br /><br />I thought about walking to Olalla, where Justin lives, but decided against it. I felt no ill feelings toward him, I just didn't want to see anyone right then. So I headed the other way, to Purdy. I almost stopped at the Purdy Spit, to sit on the beach for a while, but I couldn't stop walking. So I kept going.&nbsp;<br /><br />I got on the freeway and walked until I got to the Burnham exit. I had walked all the way to Gig Harbor. I stopped briefly in front of the Target and Albertson's stores on top of the hill, and looked at my watch. It had taken me only three hours to walk there.&nbsp;<br /><br />I still didn't want to go home, but my legs were cramping up fairly badly by then, and I didn't think they'd take me the remaining distance to where I wanted to go. So I walked around that area of Gig Harbor for about an hour, circling the area over and over again.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then I went back to Albertson's. They had a payphone. I had no money on me, not having planned to walk as far as I did. I kept playing with the ring Justin gave me for Christmas, feeling insecure and upset as all Hell still. I had to call though. I couldn't walk anymore. My legs hurt so bad I could barely stand, and was getting stiff and wobbly. So I called Collect. As it turns out, my aunt and uncle do not accept Collect calls, and neither does my&nbsp; mother. The people Justin lives with do, though. Linda answered, and I kept apologizing for waking her up so early. It was six in the morning, and she sounded really tired. She got ahold of my family, and my uncle picked me up and took me home.&nbsp;<br /><br />I feel better now, but that walk only took the edge off of what I was feeling. Apathy is setting in, but it feels temporary, like I'm just in the eye of a bigass emotional storm. Maybe next time I take off I'll have the good sense to take my wallet and my pepperspray with me.</p>"

Also, today I am going out to the tribal agency (SPIPA) and have to take part in a fashion show. *headdesk* I must also suffer high heels. Yippee. But at least I feel all nice and clean, and not like a walking greaseball. *grins* I'm dragging Justin along, too. *laughs* He keeps complaining that they all gawk at him because he's the only white kid there. In his own words, ""Okay, but they all keep staring at the tall red-headed beanpole white kid, and wondering why you're going out with an Aryan."" Because most of the people there look very obviously Native American. Truth be told, though, most of them could care less.&nbsp;

Other than that, my mom has a boyfriend now, has had one for two or three weeks. His name is Paul. She met him at a bar.&nbsp; She had&nbsp;not been to a bar before this for over half a dozen years, maybe a decade, I'm not sure. It's my fault she was there in&nbsp;the first place. I had stayed out all night, having called her and gotten her permission. That night she went out, got drunk, met Paul whom she says was just applying there and drank only coffee. She did not come home that night, even though she should have been there to take care of my two brothers.&nbsp;

She hasn't been home much since, and she's only slept at home maybe two or three times since she met him.&nbsp;So my uncle kicked her out. Now Mom is alternately bouncing from place to place with Paul (who has no home, no job, no anything) or sleeping in the car. She's making plans for us to move out with her, but they're really iffy. One of my brothers is really angry at her and has already refused to move out with us, which is fine, because she gave us each a choice whether to stay with my aunt and uncle or move out with her.&nbsp;I'm undecided as yet. My youngest brother is 10 years old. I raised him for the first five or six years of his life. Mom may not take care of him, if she continues like she's been doing the past few weeks. He's already decided he's moving with Mom. I'm trying to decide whether to stay here and definitely get my education, definitely be able to still see my friends and Justin, or go and make sure Sevy's going to be okay and maybe be forced to give up all that.&nbsp;

We only squeezed in one tonight (at my place) and we're hoping the people he lives with will let us watch one or two more tomorrow at his place.&nbsp;<br /><br />For any of you who perhaps planned to see <em>The Hills Have Eyes</em> and have not yet, <strong>DON'T.</strong> It is not scary. Just really, <em>really</em> sick. We also rented <em>The House on Haunted Hill</em>, but we were only about ten minutes into it when his ride came to pick him up. *laughs* And we haven't touched <em>Hostel</em> yet. Thus the hope for a continuation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, the next person who questions Justin's integrity will get a free nosejob. It will be painful. He knows I will hit him if he misbehaves, and we're content with kissing. (On a side note, he thinks he's not a good kisser, but <em>damn!</em>) So, to those who would say that because he is a guy he would push for sex, you obviously don't know him and need to stop judging what you don't know.&nbsp;<br /><br />...That concludes this ra-- er, update. *laughs*<br />"

"event","I don't know how to deal. I'm <em>way</em> out of my league.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are less than a month into this relationship. Already we've both helped each other through a moment or two where it seemed the world was crashing down around our ears. Quite frankly, we're both a bit attached to each other and it shows. Our teacher puts up with us playing footsie and making faces in class because it doesn't make us any less productive as students, so that's not a problem. He notices when I'm even the slightest bit stressed, whereas my own family members don't even notice when I've been crying.&nbsp;<br /><br />We went out to see a movie tonight. Tomorrow he's going to church with my family and I. For those of you who don't know, I haven't gone to church in a while, and certainly not willingly. I'm actually looking forward to going, sort of.&nbsp;But now I've gotten sidetracked.&nbsp;<br /><br />Justin doesn't drive yet and neither do I, so his dad drove me home and then him. Justin had said earlier there was something he wanted to tell me. On the way home he leaned down and whispered, ""I love you.""&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know how to answer that. Hells yes I like him, and I'm more than a little attached. It felt good to hear it, and god<em>damn</em> it felt good that it sounded like he meant it. But it scared the tar out of me at the same time. <em>He</em> is not the problem. He's not what scares me. There's <em>nothing</em> scary about him. What scares me is the ""love"" thing. My father used to use that as a reason why I should obey oppressive commands. My mother has taken over that role. People who say they love me usually either try to control me or they leave me.&nbsp;<br /><br />Justin's not the controlling type. He hasn't had many girlfriends before, so he's not a player. But he's left places before. Maybe that shouldn't bother me yet. Especially since he's staying here in Washington (despite the fact that he can't stand the climate here any more than I can) partly because of me.&nbsp;<br /><br />My family is rarely ever on my side, and Justin's family apparently mirrors that. Both of us have had to deal recently with thinking we were going to be kicked out. We both have a tendency to put on a good show, pretending we're okay when we aren't. And both of us have recently gone through a time where it seemed like I was the only one on his side, and he was the only one on mine.&nbsp;<br /><br />I guess more or less this particular spurt of word-vomiting is for two things:&nbsp;<br />1) to help me figure out my own feelings; and<br />2) to help me figure out how to answer that.&nbsp;<br /><br />*sigh* Good night, people."

He <i>did</i> meet Aunt Heidi, Uncle Lawrence, and my brother Jesse. The little cousins were asleep or he'd have met them too. 

We watched a new horror flick called <i>Stay Alive,</i> which wasn't very scary. 

I kept waiting for my aunt and uncle to start interrogating Justin like they'd kept saying they were going to do, but they didn't. Poor guy, he was so nervous. Didn't help that I thought my aunt and uncle were serious when they said they were going to interrogate him, and I thought they were serious, so I warned him. 

When he left neither of us had the guts to give each other a goodnight peck on the cheek. *laughs* Guess I felt a bit nervous myself. 

Not long after Justin's ride pulled out of the driveway I got the general consensus-- everyone liked him-- and the old, ""But he may not be the nice guy he seems to be,"" speech and was told that with any guy I must always be careful and whatnot. Then I got on IM, and low and behold, Justin came on!

My family wants him to do more activities with us as a family if we're going to continue our relationship, so he actually said he'd go to church with us. That's nice, since I'm not too far past the ""church scares me so bad I shake"" phase. *laughs* I've slipped into the ""defensive sleeping"" phase, or maybe it's the way the pastor talks, but either way I doubt I'll be falling asleep on the sermons so much now.

Wrote another song. I also wrote a short X-men pseudo-slash fic I want Kage to come beta for me. Because she's good like that.&nbsp;

I went to the fair twice this weekend and had sooooo much fun. I only went on a few rides (I get motion-sick, not to the point of throwing up, but enough that it's rather off-putting), but the atmosphere is just awesome. I love it. The noise, the crowds, the people, the grins everywhere, the lights and colors and shiny stuff everywhere, the music, the noise, did I mention the noise? Mom pretty much had to pry me off the ceiling both times when we got home, but it was awesome. I played some games, won my youngest brother two pimp hats (one of which has a Jolly Roger and says Booty Call and God it's great that he wears it without knowing what ""booty call"" is), and had an elephant ear and cotton candy and a caramel apple.&nbsp;I bought a really cute skirt from this little old Chinese lady, too.

*grins* Well, I need to go help clean the house, and my brother is earning his nickname (Sarge) while we're at it, so I'm gonna leave the other stuff I wanted to say for later."

"event","<p>Well... I'm just feeling kind of melancholy and moody, or antisocial and apathetic by turns today. I'm not quite sure why. My brain's just putting those spins on everything today. </p>
<p>I've been on the 'net today since about three, and despite having about one or two dozen friends who could pull me out of my funk (possibly without even realizing I was <em>in</em> a funk) I didn't sign in to any of my IM programs until after eight, because I just didn't feel like talking to anyone.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nothing particularly upsetting or discouraging happened today. Maybe it's just the last of my moody teenager-ness.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, I've been working. Neither of my jobs has been giving me very many hours, though. I didn't expect a lot of hours from Silhouette, since they only have their employees work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. But Hollywood Video is only giving me about eight hours a week. *sigh* I can cover my cell phone bill this month, at least.&nbsp;Not really going to be any money left over to set aside for moving out, though.&nbsp;<br /><br />On the bright side, I'm really strongly considering becoming a criminal profiler, and if I get my paperwork done and turned in by the 19th, I can get into college for the fall quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />...I'm gonna go get a sweatshirt now. I'm cold. </p>"

"event","Woot! I don't think I'm the only one who had their fingers crossed. Yesterday I got <em>one</em> part-time job confirmed. Just a few minutes ago I got a second one confirmed. I had my first day of work at the former today, and tomorrow I'll have my first day of work at the latter.<br /><br />Well, the one I worked at today is a marketing service. Basically we just do demos, which means we're the people you see handing out samples in grocery stores. I did <em>really</em> well. No bragging intended, but I really am good at sales. We sold out of the product I was demoing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm just doing an orientation for the other job (a video store thing), but it's technically considered my first day of work. They're gonna pay me for it, which is cool since I have to miss work at&nbsp;Silhouette Marketing Service for it.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, I am a tired little working girl now. And a slightly bored little working girl. (Hmmm... this would be a <em>really</em> good time for Tag or Kage to show up on MSN.... *hinthint*)<br /><br />Oh. I just remembered. I have to&nbsp;call my boss at SMS to let her know I can't demo tomorrow. I <em>did</em> tell her I might not be able to, but I should give her a heads-up anyway.&nbsp;"

"event","<p>I cut myself in carving class. The first student to do it, too. Damn I'm clumsy! One of the instructors cut himself too, in a previous class. </p>
<p>Mm. Maybe when I finish I'll just give the carving tools to my brother. </p>
<p>Anyhow, the instructors (there are three) all made a big deal out of it, and everybody acted the way they do at the scene of a carwreck: put down whatever you may be doing and &lt;i&gt;stare.&lt;/i&gt; Hehe. It was funny. The cut bled pretty bad, but I kept telling everyone it was just a nick. Turns out I was right. The doctor said the cut is very superficial and should heal in a week. In the meantime, I'm stuck wearing a splint, and have been told to limit the use of my left hand. </p>
<p>The cut's on the knuckle of my left thumb, and it looks worse than it really is. No one can see it now, since it's wrapped in a helluva thick layer of gauze, but it's so minor. I've had papercuts that hurt worse. The doctor thought about a stitch or two, but went with a superglue-like thing called DermaBond instead, since that'll help me keep more mobility.&nbsp;<br /><br />The same stroke of the knife that put my thumb out of commision nicked my middle finger, and that's Band-Aided, because that one really is more like a papercut.&nbsp;<br /><br />But you'd think they'd teach the nurses to use their brains. The guy &lt;i&gt;heard&lt;/i&gt; the doctor tell me to limit the use of my left hand, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; warn me that the arm that got the tetanus shot would hurt for a few days. Badly. So the nurse came in and gave me a shot in my &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; arm. *headdesk* How do these people survive on so little brainpower?&nbsp;<br /><br />On the bright side, it looks cool, I get sympathy spoiling, and I get out of chores to some degree! W00t!</p>"

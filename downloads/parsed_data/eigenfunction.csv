"event","<i>how your mother loved you then
when you were first born:
how, yawning, she clasped you to her breast,
too drowsy to think that your infant smile
would one day walk a wedding aisle,
or that your eyes' angelic gleam
nurtured an awful beauty's dream.
too loving to dismay,
her soft mind could have never thought
the fallen star her pain had wrought
would make me bleed one day.</i>

goddamnit, i can't stay away from her, there are no anodynes to deaden this suffering"

"event","a severe migraine hit at around ten, sent me to the floor, right in the middle of the hall.  the kids didn't think anything of it, naturally; carl was uncharacteristically pissed, pacing around and moaning, 'oh god, oh god.'  calm down, shut up, i told him.  after a couple of hours and a few cocktails I was right as rain.  but I think I hit it on something going down.  mother fucker.

...and with that triviality, my weekly tribulation quota has peaked.  beware of rollover."

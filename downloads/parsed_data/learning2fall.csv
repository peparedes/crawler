So i ordered a large mighty meaty from dominos and sat impatiently as it was being made telepathically urging the people making it to work faster.

ran home and started to devour it, tom took a few slices but wasnt fast enough so halfway through the pizza i purged.. then went back for some more.
how fucking stupid!!

i've been heavily restricting and purging evening meals for ages now.. i've managed to get down to uner 300 calories a day which is ace.
except today i worked a 12 hour shift and fucked it up totally.
half a piece of toast and jam, 2 cans of redbull.. which is like 90 calories in itself.
3 crumpets at 70 calories a piece and i had some salad for dinner...
errr.. i think my string of losing a pound a day had finally come to an end.
haha oh fuckity fuck.
im so not going to be 11.2 tomorrow.. i'll be lucky if im even 11.3 again.

So i feel a lot better today.
I attempted to go to the gym. I saw David at least. Then i started to work out. We're talking 15mins into it i started to feel really dizzy so i had to stop.
RAGE.

I was also supposed to be going out last night but it seems i fell asleep around 7pm so i slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling a lot better.

Talking about David.
He seemed to get proper rage with me because i wasnt eating EVERYTHING on my diet sheet FFS. And because i wasnt weighing myself only once a week.
So i decided i now have 3 options.

1. Continue to be truthful to an extent and have him be pissed at me.
2. Tell him i have an eating disorder.
3. Lie and tell him i'm following it perfectly.

He said i could do it every other day but.. to be fair. I have a eating disorder. And he doesnt know that.

B. Asking if i could do my fitness routine twice in a day if i missed a day.
- NO thats stupid you need a day off at least. you cant work out 7 days a week *pause* you look dissapointed about that..

C. You have to stick to my plan ok, you need to eat at each interval. If you dont eat yes you will lose weight but your metabolism will be shot to pieces and as soon as you eat even a little bit it will be stored as fat straight away.
Listen to me. I know what i'm talking about.

i dont really understand kgs because 8lbs is 4kgs too.
>_< meh.

Thomas: ""1kg in 4 days? Are you wasting away to nothing on the eat nothing diet?""

He wont be laughing soon...

5 days till his return and i have to weigh at least under 11st so 10st 13 lol. thats only 2lb really.

I know i can do it.

I've been to the gym 5 days in a row now.
Today will be my 6th.

Temporary measures till he comes home.
Then i'll space it out to 3 days a week."

"event","so i made the sacred heart soup.
british style.
Its so hard to buy the matching ingredients over here.

Egh, so anyway.
I tried to put it together except MY scared heart soup comes to 100calories. hehehe but for the amount of soup i made.
I reckon thats ok.

However by the looks of my soup.
it shouldnt be consumed by any living being."

I didnt eat last night. no no no.

The only problem is....
I'm really hungry now.

I'd love to know how many miles i actually walk being at work.

And i LOVE the fact that i'm 157 tonight and i was 157/8 this morning.

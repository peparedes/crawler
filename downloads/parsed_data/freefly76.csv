"event","Well Mr. B should be happy I am going to start keeping up with my journal now. So lets see for anyone that doesn't know or that cares. I have a fat job, I work at the Coast Guard base here in Mobile. I maintain the flight simulators (sims) the CG pilots learn to fly in. It is a contract, which means that I work for Aero Simulation Inc. 

Ok here is a question for everyone. If your buddy has this girlfriend that is like syco world must revolve around her, and she drives you crazy. So here is the question. I am looking for a chick, but being around her is making me wonder if I really want to worry about trying to find a lady? I think the  first thing is to find a girl that isn't codependent. 

Well that is all for tonight more to come this week"

"event","Well this was weird. I have really been struggling with life for the past month or so. I have been complacent and not concerned about God or anything else for that matter.
Which has made life suck for a while now. Well the past couple of days I have been thinking about ""Why I keep putting God off"".
Then I am in my room thinking about What ""I"" can do to fix my life. As I am putting a move on to get a cure for my boredom.  Well I notice this rodeo move on TBN. (ok yes mike this was just like a watch night movie)...Any way this was like bad acting and all that good stuff.  But since it was a rodeo movie I watched. I love the rodeo Just to let u all know. This movie was awesome it got me closer to God in one hour than I have been in a while to be honest it was to fell Him working in my hart for the first time in a while.ok That was long and wordy, but sorry I thought it was so cool I had to put it in here.  It's cool to have Mike & Peter back on US soil .Sorry it's Alabama guys Any way later"

"event","Well the restraunt business is dead in mobile,al. Which really sucks for me. Still thinking about skydiving alot. Me and Mr. B will probably be going to bridge day this year. Today one of my tables was telling his kid the story of how the devil ended up in hell, and the next time I came back to check on them he was telling him the creation story and how God made eve. That was awesome to here a dad telling his son about God with no reservations. How cool is that, that made my day a little better.  Word of advice for every one, when in a restraunt don't tell the server how good of a job he did that you really enjoyed the service then check out on the tip. that isn't cool. Anyway that's all of my babbling for the day. Hopefully tomorrow will be a lot better.
                       later"

"event","we got foxtel (digital cable or satellite or something) just in time for post season baseball.  it is hard enough being a baseball fan but when the games are at 6 and 7 am the difficulty is at a whole new level.  anyway, so i have been watching baseball every morning, which is great, but it really makes me miss home.  ok, well the game is back on...."

"event","So I just got back from my mid-semester  break, which was a 10 day trip to Fiji.  Of course, it was amazing and definitely eventful.  I kind of don't want to type the story of my life, so I'll hit the highlights.  On the 23rd, Allie, Jen, and I got a cab at 4.15 AM to the airport.  We caught our flight to Brisbane, where i set off this random detector for explosive materials, so of course this led to a 20 minute procedure ending up with them preforming the test again and finding absolutely nothing.  Then was the flight to Nadi (you say it Nandi).  We go there and went through immigration and then guess whose bag didn't show up?  Oh, it was mine, if you hadn't guessed.  So i filled out the form so they could get it back to me... the only problem was, we were staying in a different place every night and i only knew the place we would be for the first night.  so... i got really stressed out about it and was convinced i wasnt going to get my bag back until we were in nadi again five days later.  Oh.. plus they wanted ME to come pick it up!  I was like, i dont think so.. you are the one who f'ed up.  I shouldnt have to come back to the airport to get the bag.  And after wearing the same clothes a few days and borrowing shower stuff, my bag finally caught up to me. Then I jumped up and down several times, did a little endzone dance and gave the huge fijian guy who brought my bag a big hug.  So that was over.  It also rained for the first 5 days or something too.  OK.. that is all of the bad stuff.  Now for the good.  I met a bunch of cool people, including one guy who lives in the building next to us, coogee view, who i had never met, a bunch of english people, a crazy swiss guy, and some really cool fijians.  I learned tons about Fiji and Fijian culture.  I have a Fijian pen pal now, a 16 yr old girl who wants to be a teacher that i met at the school we visited.  I learned the difference between scottish, irish, welsh, and english accents.  I also learned what exactly the british isles and the united kingdom entail.  A Samoan guy named Jon taught me a card trick and made sure that i was the chief for the second kava ceremony that i participated in.  i wore a sulu and said bula... a lot.  i also learned the words to fish n' chips... the best song ever recorded by the kavaholics.  I saw two of the three mcdonalds that there are in fiji and got a $.50 cone on the first and last nights we were there.  I tried curry for the first time and ate a green chili (will never do again).  Saw Fiji's biggest city and its capital and visited a rural town and a village.  Hiked through a rainforest.. in the rain, then tubed down a river.. in the rain, still wearing my clothes because i was freezing, then jumped off a waterfall (don't worry, it was disappointingly short) in the rain and took a longboat ride back to our bus in the rain.  I went sandboarding down a surprisingly big and steep hill (the kind that you climb up once and say i'm done, even though it was super fun... but i really did it more than once anyway..)  Jen and I had the first cocktails we had in fiji, mai tai's, bought for us by some 35 yr. old guy who had just bought 3 acres of land somewhere in fiji.  I participated in a traditional fijian dance and held a limbo contest later on the dance floor with allie as the other side of the bar, played ping pong for 2 hrs with a 9 yr old cute little french boy named leo because i couldnt find allie and jen, then later when we were all dancing, i had some of the english guys teach me how to say ""i would like to dance with you leo"" in french and i told it to him while he was sitting on his dad's lap and he was so embarrassed he wouldn't do it and his dad was laughing and nudging him up but no luck.  i was turned down by a 9 yr. old.  i'll get over it.. someday.  the next morning Jen locked herself in the bathroom.  that was pretty funny.  i drank a lot of fiji bottled water in fiji, which i thought was funny at first, but, naturally, that is about the only bottled water they have.  (the bottles are square so when you drop them they don't roll away and the bottle is more eye-catching than a round one).  I participated in a kava ceremony at Ratu Save's village and wove a fijian bracelet.  We took a boat to Nanau-i-Ra (sp?)Island and played some mad games of beach volleyball, which I enjoyed because i could kick all of the girls and all of the guys except the really tall one's butts.  In the process i made fun with the fijian guys who work on the island (a good salary in Fiji is $1.40 FJ/hr (~$.90-1.00 US), by the way... the country is VERY poor)  Tried sugar can stolen from a random field.  Went into a fijian mud pit and had a massive mud fight (the mud is supposed to have healing properties, like a spa treatment worth hundreds at home, but this was just out in a field) then rinsed off in a hot spring.  Went out to some islands.  Kayaked, snorkeled (and scraped my knee up on coral, but that was ok because the fish were awesome), layed in some hammocks, soaked up lots of sun once it stopped raining.  learned how to climb a coconut tree (although I can't do it) and crack a coconut. Ate some good food, heard lots of beautiful fijian music, had to dance with a super sweaty fijian guy at the second ceremonial dance we saw, was the chief at the second kava ceremony, like i said.  played some more volleyball with a different group of staff-- more fijian friends.  listened to the scottish scuba diving guy james serenade the island staff with tenacious d tunes.  made acquaintance with notorious ""whiteboots"", or simply ""wb""  whose name i would later find out is Joey, who was one one of the islands with us and was traveling with this other girl who was ok because she never talked and the most obnoxious foul mouthed canadian i have ever seen.  they were basically ridiculous and drank the whole time they were there... two or three days and nights... ending up in the single highest bar tab for two or three days... wb's... it was for over $750.  Luckily, they left before we did.  Then it was fun to make fun of her with allie, jen, and our new english friends chris and kelly.  got a little burned, but nothing to worry about.  ahhh.... there is tons more, i'm sure.  but ill write more later... if you're lucky."

"event","Monday night Jacqueline asked if Allie and I wanted to go to dinner in the city.  Her dad was coming to town and wanted to take her and some of her friends out.  I was originally just going to stay home and do some work before break, but i was like, hey, free food... and i had no food at the time, which made the decision a lil easier.  So Jac's dad took her, Tiffany, their friend Chris, Allie, and me to dinner at the Sydney Cafe.  It is right across from circular quay (where the Harbour Bridge and the opera house are) on the top floor of the customs house.  First of all, the customs house is really cool.  The outside is all old and the inside is all super modern.  Also, in the floor of the first floor lobby there is a model of the city inset with glass panels over it, so you can go walk over it and stuff.  It is really neat and we felt the need to take multiple pictures trying to make it look like we were flying over sydney, sitting on sydney, pointing to the opera house, etc. (this was all at 11pm, after dinner, when no one else was in the building except the people at the information desk.  i'm sure we amused them.)  So anyway, the restaurant was amazing and the balcony looked straight out to the bridge, which was all lit up, and the food was really good, and our bill for 7 people was $600.  Yea... about, what, $85 per person or something?  Entrees (appetizers) were around $20, mains (entrees) were about $40, glasses of wine (glasses of wine) $10 each, dessert $15.  All of it was amazing.  I got a little rocket and parmesean salad, a glass of semillon (and proceeded to impress jac's dad and his girlfriend with the wine knowledge i just acquired in hunter valley... she said, the wine here is so white compared to home.. it is more yellow there.  i said, well, this is a 2004, and whites yellow with time.  they also acquire a nutty, buttery taste.  the shelf life of a typical white is 10 yrs...etc.  i felt pretty smart seeing that my wine knowledge exceeded that of someone who drops $600 on one dinner like it's nothing.)  and woodgrilled tuna, and then the five of us girls all got five different desserts, all of which were really good, and shared them.  It was quite a night.  Apparently Jac doesn't even really know what her dad does.  He dabbles in real estate.  They live in Aspen and his company is in Baltimore... so he flies across the country every other week.  He also owns an electronic store and also, apparently, Israel.  Basically, anyway.  Apparently he went to Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, which is a big deal, and yea... he's some big shot in israel.  So, the moral of the story, I enjoyed dinner.. Note to self: send thank you card."

"event","BLAH.  I am putting off writing this little English paper.  I should just do it because it is only 1000 words, which is like 3 pages and I have already done a presentation on it, so all of the research is done.  Maybe in a minute I'll just do it... We went out in Bondi last night, which was a first for me.  It was pretty fun.  I think I'd like to go back.  We always say we are going to after we go to the Palace on Wed. but it never happens.  Other than that, not much is up.  I am so pumped up that the Swans won their semi-final match.  Now they play West Coast, I think, next weekend.  There are two bad things about this, though.  No.1.. and this is a big one, my hero Barry Hall has been suspended from the game because he barely punched this guy in the ribs (he used to be a boxer) and then the guy was rolling around on the ground acting all hurt.  SO.... no Barry Hall, which is bad news for the Swans.  Oh I don't know if I said anything about this before, but Tyrone is in a class with one of the Swans and he came over to do a group project, so we had Tadgh Kennelly in our living room.  I was pumped up about it.  Kelly and I were sitting on opposite couches in the room and IMing each other about him and giggling the whole time, looking up his stats and pics of him and stuff.  It was fun.  And finally for the second thing... we will be in Fiji when the game happens and in all likelihood will not be a place where there are TVs, so I won't be able to watch the game.  Sad day.  I suppose there are worse things than being stuck in Fiji, though."

"event","i know i haven't written in a while, but as the aussie's say, ""i couldn't be bothered.""  We are actually starting to have some work in classes and also the weather has been beautiful so we have been out on the beach or doing work.. and of course, when I'm doing work I never get distracted :P  so I wouldn't have updated my journal then.  i'm actually surprised i have been so good about updating anyway.  so... after the last cookout, where i left off.. jen and i went to an extended power hour (1 hr. plus another hr.) with the Irish, which was fun, then we were walking over to the palace and we decided we didnt want to go, so jen and i just went home.  Sounds not very exciting, i know. but, it was fun.  the next day i had to work on my english presentation that was the next day, which included a little trip to the library at 3pm because i didnt know we were supposed to do outside research (the library closed at 6, so obviously i got a lot done).  then monday was the presentation and monday night was studying for my history test the next day.  it was fine, no big deal.  tuesday was the test then at night i did my history homework then erin drug/dragged, i dont know, me out to the city.  they guy i met last wednesday at the palace, matt, had been texting me every day and i had talked to him on the phone two or three times and he REALLY wanted to do something with me so i called him to see if he wanted to go with us and bring some friends.  (matt is in the australian navy and is freakishly nice to me.  i pretty much can't handle it he's so nice.  i told him last night, when he called me..again.. that he is way too nice to me.  anyway...)  so he and his friend steve and erin and i went to the city.  we went to kings cross and erin was basically having a ball and wanted to go talk to one of the prostitutes but didn't end up doing it, then she wanted to go into a strip club... anyway, kings cross was pretty dead seeing how it was a tuesday night.  so then we decided we wanted to leave and go somewhere on george.  erin and i kind of just wanted to go to scruffy murphy's because we knew it would be good on a tuesday, but the guys dropped us off at jackson's (not like jackson's in nashville, unfortunately)because they had to work at 6 and wanted to go home.  so we went in and everyone there was in a suit... it was massive after work drinking action.  so we decided we wouldn't stay long and the guys called and said they felt bad leaving us there so they came back and we had a drink and then they took us home.  kind of a boring night... but we didn't have to take the bus, so it was pretty good.  then the next night i was supposed to go on a date with matt, but he is entirely too nice to me and it kind of gets annoying and aussie guys have problems with just being friends with girls, so i didn't really want to spend extended periods of time with him so i decided i would go to dana and lindsays for a power hour and then kathleens for one and then to the palace, and i told him to come if he wanted and bring friends (at the request of my friends, but really i thought steve, the guy we went out with the night before was hot, so i wasn't too opposed to meeting some more of his friends)... so they came when we were almost done at dana and lindsays and then came to kathleen's which was crazy because there were so many ppl there.  it was a good collection, aussie guys, australian navy guys, irish guys, and american girls.. funny, but i dont think there were american guys there.  and some appearances by a wooden spoon and a fake wooden arm, no one knows where that came from.  it was really fun.  that was followed by about 10 minutes at the palace, then home.  i really wanted to stay out longer but one of my friends didn't get let in.. so i decided to leave.. that's the way it goes.  yesterday.. i didn't really do anything... and when i say i didnt do anything, i didn't even go out and sleep on the beach.  i went to my class from 10-11, came home and sat around.  ordered some dominos, went to pick it up and then took a nap.  after i woke up i took a shower and that was the end of me really doing anything for the day.  today i would say i am going to go work on the beach, but its cloudy and i don't think its very warm... but tonight is the grand finals for AFL and the swans are playing st. kilda, so i will have to watch that, and of course matt wants to take me to dinner and then go watch the game, which might be fine, but i had told andy i might meet him in the city for drinks and i cant really watch the game with matt and be like, im off to meet andy in the city.. so i'll have to think about that one.  oh, one of the swans, tadgh kennelly was in our living room the other day.  he goes to uni with us and is in a tutorial group with ben so they were doing a group project.  it was fun because kelly and i were sitting on opposite couches with our laptops and IMing each other about him and checking his stats and stuff and giggling the whole time.  ok.. im going to try to do work or something.  fiji exactly one week from now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","i guess i haven't really been writing much lately.  well, things are pretty much what i would call ""normal"" for here.  but i have come to the realization that our semester is almost over.  we are done with week 7 and there are 14 weeks of class, but trust me, this is the beginning of the end.  next week a lot of people have papers and tests, so that doesnt count as a real week.  then next weekend we are going camping at garie beach (the awesome one we found on that crazy hike).  The next week i will be here just until thursday because then we leave for fiji.  i will be there until the next monday and then will have the rest of that week in sydney.  then there is one week of class before i have a paper worth at least 40% of my grade in all of my classes, a presentation, and two tests within the next two weeks.  then we have study break and finals.  seriously there are like two weeks left in the semester.  this also means that i need to get my butt into gear if i hope to finish all those papers.  i have started on my history one and i am going to basically work but butt off up until we leave for fiji, and anyway, those of you who know me well know that it isnt really something to get worried about because it is impossible for me to not get done the things i need to get done (that was a little disclaimer for the mother who worries that my life is falling apart while i am here).  So anyway, yea... its going to be all work and no (very little) play for me for a while, except for the fact that it is going to be 27 on saturday (81 for the metric-impaired) so i will probably be out on the beach.  but i do that every day i dont have class anyway (i read while im out there).  I think that's it.. i'm going to go do work.  

oh!!! my hair straightener broke too.  i guess it couldnt handle the voltage here or something even though it was supposed to be able to.  so i am forced with a decision.  either buy a new one (i think the cheapest ones here are like $80) or go the rest of the semester with semi-bad hair that i will always have to put up in a pony tail by lunchtime.  hmmmmm  decisions, decisions"

"event","everything is pretty much the same as it has been.  class and such.  i did go to two rugby games this weekend though, one on saturday and one on sunday.  the one saturday was randwick rugby, which is Rugby Union, then on sunday we went to a sydney roosters game at aussie stadium, which is Rugby League.  I didnt really like the roosters game but the weather was pretty gross on sunday, so that probably had something to do with it.  one other thing, right before the roosters game, allie, jen, and i went to book our fiji tour for spring break (2 weeks from now).

"event","thursday morning i wrote that i felt like not doing anything.... well that sort of changed when someone came up with the great idea of having a lil gender bender party.  basically travis and bryan were wearing a dress and a skirt, respectively, and a bunch of us girls decided to dress up as guys because it is really flipping comfortable compared to what we normally wear.  so i decided i would be a vandy boy for the night and put on some j.crew boxers, some seven jeans, a pink polo shirt, and a vandy baseball cap and popped my collar.  then erin dressed up as a vandy boy as well and rocked some aviators and sam came over and got in on the mocking of the vandy male.  it was awesome.. the whole time we were doing it i was so comfortable and got to walk around with this i-dont-give-a-crap look on my face and think i was better than everyone else.  we took a lot of pictures.  then we put on some normal clothes and went to coogee bay hotel for just a lil bit and i had changed into MY sevens and pink polo with a popped collar and this middle aged aussie guy came up to me and said could you be any more nerdy? and i said, YES< BUT I LEFT MY GLASSES AT HOME!  it's not nerdy, its preppy.  and then he kind of walked away and then later he tried to dance with me... but he had some gray hair and frankly he was sketchy, like all of the non-americans at coogee bay hotel.  there has to  be some sort of cultural difference here that i'm just not picking up on because surely not every australian is sketchy..  that was thursday.  friday i laid on the beach and studied for polisci a little.  it was matt from vassar's bday so we were going to go on a pub crawl, but i was finishing some work and didnt make it to their place before the left for the city, but it was brett's birthday the next day, so people were going out and he was going to celebrate at midnight, so i just went with them.  we went to darling harbour, which is supposed to be a pretty good scene at night, but it took us forever to get there and after walking way out of the way and being advised by some guy that we better stick together in that neighbourhood, we decided to cab it to the harbour.  then we got a little mackers (mcdonalds) and waited for some more people who were supposed to meet us.  then we went to homebar- it sucked so we left, then we went to wallabies- it sucked because everyone was sitting on couches watching the ashes (australia vs. england cricket), then we went downstairs to pontoon, which actually started to be pretty fun.  they were playing some good hip hop and a lot of people were dancing, so of course allie and kelly and i joined in while the guys kind of stood by the bar because that is what they do.  then the guys were like, lets leave and go to home (a big club, not to be confused with homebar).  there was a huge line earlier, but it was like 1.30 at that point so we thought it might be better.  there was still a line, but it was shorter.  so we waited in the line and got to the door and found out there was a $22 cover charge.  so we left because that sucks, obviously.  so then the guys were like lets go to cargo bar.  by this time all the girls were like, let's just go home.  the whole night has sucked except for like 45 minutes of it and our feet hurt.  but... we went to cargo bar.  it was ok and probably would have been better if we had been drinking, but there were a lot of good looking people there and the bouncers were really pumped up that we were from america and we asking us what states we were from and such.  i think they like americans more downtown, in coogee they are way too used to us because we are everywhere.  anyway, after cargo bar we went home.  yesterday morning i went into the city with erin, kathleen, and margaret to go to a market.  it was kind of boring and i didnt get anything except a pair of sunglasses because my other pair had been crushed by a book, somehow.  after that i came home, got some lunch, and went to the rugby game at the coogee oval with erin, kathleen, sarah, jen, and four of the irish boys.  we have passes for free entry for the rest of their season and also memberships to their club (kind of their lounge/bar that is across the road) so we were like, hey, why not?  it was pretty fun and randwick ended up winning by three.  then we got some dominos (first time since ive been here) kathleen and sarah were supposed to go to this birthday party last night and they didnt know the guy who was having the party, but they were still going to go.  they had been invited by their friends moose, matt, and steve, who i had met as well and i guess steve put in a special request with kathleen for us to come, so erin and i got invited in a round about way also.  so we show up at this party and it is kind of weird, obviously, because we are crashing it.  then we see the people there who we know and they were like, yeah the birthday boy is awesome, he's so cool with it (us being there and not knowing him).  his name was cameron and he was turning 21.  it was kind of a strange party because there were a lot of older people there too, like family and family friends and whatnot, but it was an open bar and after a mimosa i was fine with it.  erin and i met cameron and he was like oh its really fine because 20 people said they were coming and didnt show so you guys took their place and i was like, oh do you want more people here.  i can call some girls and get them over here.  and he was like yea, as long as they aren't guys.  so i called jen, who was with lauren and they came over from the palace, and sherry and she, anne, and kelly came a little later.  of course they were all into it because it was an open bar and it was actually really fun and the people were really nice.  anyway, before sherry and those guys got there they started doing toasts at the party.  i guess they would have been funny, but i couldnt really hear/understand what they were saying.  in the middle of it, this older guy who had obviously knocked a few back was standing at the bar next to jen and lauren and me and made some comment about pretty girls to the guys our age who were standing around him.  so we started talking to him and he found out we were from the states and said that he had been in the military and stationed in georgia during the gulf war, so we had a good little conversation about new orleans and savannah and nashville and atlanta and the guy was awesome, really.  then the toasts were stil going on and one of the bartenders (they were three adorable little old guys) dropped a tray of glasses and everyone started cheering and, for some reason i was holding one of those party popper things that has the little string on it and i decided it was as good a time as any, so i  popped it.  it was pretty funny and then someone else popped theirs and i was like ha! i did it first, it wasnt as clever when you did it.  anyway...finally the speeches were over and people started dancing and this is turning into a long entry.  so we learned some aussie line dance that i might bust out at wildhorse when i get back and drank and got the old people to go dance with us and each other and were just about to get on the mic to give cameron a shout out from his new friends when the party was over and everyone moved to the palace.  there was a cover (gasp!!) but steve paid mine and jens and we went in and danced for awhile.  then i was tired, just like i am tired of typing."

"event","last night we all went to the palace, because, well that's what you do here on a wednesday night if you're an american.  it was pretty fun and i think everyone had a good time which is rare when you are talking about 15 or 20 people.  i hung out with andy and paul again, which was fun then it was back to the rez.  a bunch of us ended up in webbs room and just chilled there and listened to some dave and i went picture crazy.  while we were in there kelly went out and came back and said that travis' door was open.  so of course allie and i couldn't let that go.  we went into his room and threw his pillows up on this really high cubby hole and took his comforter and put it up on the 4th floor, where no one lives.  a little while later we went to bed and all the sudden both of our phones were ringing and then travis was banging on the door and yelling at us that we better give his comforter back.  i said we didnt have it and it wasnt even on our floor and so then he left for a minute and i start to hear all this water outside our door and stuff hitting the door, but i was in bed and half asleep so i didnt want to deal with it.  when i got up in the morning i checked the floor and it was dry so i was like ok... there must be something outside.  so i cracked the door and some water started pouring in so i slammed the door back and the bucket that was leaning on it went back so it was all the way on the floor and not tipping against the door anymore.  so then i went and put a little water back in it and put it down outside of travis's door with a piece of paper that said australia's in a drought so we thought we would save the water.  i guess that was round two, so we'll see what happens next.
stayed out on the beach for a few hours after class today.  probably not going to do anything for the rest of the day.. kind of just feel like chillin and sleepin and stuff."

"event","last night i went out with jen and anne and these two aussie blokes andy and paul.  it was pretty fun and the guys had a car so i didnt have to take the bus.  we ended up hopping around to 4 or 5 bars, but it was all-in-all an uneventful night.  this sketchy guy insisted on paying for jen and my cab home though.. and then riding with us... even though he lived nowhere near coogee.  whatever, it was a free cab ride.  
on to the real story.  this was actually on monday night.  allie and my window is on the third floor directly over our front door.  a couple weeks ago i came up with the idea that we should pour water on people when they come home from going out at night.  we had talked about it on and off since then and on monday night neither of us were going out and like 6 other people from the house were so i was like hey, we should do it tonight.  so we filled up our nalgenes and set them on the windowsill.  we were trying to scheme up a way to  find out when they were coming home but nothing came of it and i ended up putting on zoolander and going to sleep at 12.30.  an hour later like five people burst into our room screaming.  it was kelly and erin who had just come home and sherry and allie.  they were like the guys are coming the guys are coming.  i was out of it so i was kind of just like stop yelling but then i realized what was happening and i jumped up and we went over to the window and all of us were peeking out the window and a few minutes later travis, jay, and dave start up the walk and allie and i timed it perfectly and threw the water on them and hid really quickly.  they screamed and it was funny and all of us were laughing hysterically.  so kelly hurries downstairs and is all innocent and asking what is going on and apparently right after we threw the water the guy who lives above the door on the second floor popped his head out of the window and the guys went nuts and thought it was him so jay went inside and filled up a bucket of water and they were going to throw it on dave (a different dave than the one who got water thrown on him) the next time he stuck his head out the window.  so by this time erin had left our room and sherry was still in there and we hurried up and closed the door because it was basically just a matter of time before they were pounding on our door.  jay came up and congratulated us because, well, basically because what we did was awesome and he didn't get wet. during this travis and dave went and pounded on dave's door because they wanted to kick his @$$ because they thought he threw the water.  eventually they made it up to our room and were banging on the door and all else and sherry wanted to go to bed so we had to open the door but i knew they were just waiting to soak us and my bed is RIGHT inside the door and if they threw it as soon as the door started to open it would have gotten all over my bed so i put my mattress up against the wall and put on a rain jacket and sherry grabbed an umbrella and we opened the door and travis busts in with a pitcher of water and dave has this look on his face like you're all kinds of dead but we kind of talked travis down because we pointed out how lame it was that he was getting back at us by just throwing water in our faces and kelly was like, fine, just throw it on me and ill scream and kick and flail around.  so finally the guys left with a promise that they were going to kill us later on, to which we responded with something along the lines of bring it on.  they haven't done anything as of yet, but we're still waiting and watching our backs..."

"event","Allie and I and two of our friends who came through Butler, Lindsay and Dana, went to Hunter Valley for the weekend.  We got up really early on Friday morning and then went in to central station to catch the bus to drive us out there.  It was about a 2 and a half hour drive.  When we got there we settled itno our little hostel and then went on a wine tour for the afternoon with four other study abroad kids from emory and this lady form ireland, maggie in this crazy purple bus with our crazy guide Gordon.  The first place we went to was the iron gate winery and the lady that was doing the tasting for us was realy nice and was telling us all of the little tips and how to taste properly because she knew it was our first time.  She was really cool about it and i think i liked her best out of all of the people we tasted from.  Then we went on to another winery which was cool, i guess, it was Lindeman's or something like that.  Then we ate lunch at a cool little cafe and went to two other wineries.  By the end of the day I was starting to like reds... which is amazing.  Then we went cheese tasting and finally back to the hostel.  We met the owner, Michael, who had just built the hostel 5 months earlier and he was a really nice guy.  He cooked us a bunch of wood-fired pizzas which were really good and then we decided to go over to the ""bar"" that was just the next building over.  It was pretty cute.. just a metal building with a pool table, dart board, and bar in it.  We started playing games of pool and darts at the same time and started enjoying full glasses of the wine we had been sipping all day.  I drank a chardonnay, which was pretty good, but actually it was wooded with american oak and i prefer french.  How's that for wine knowledge??  We hung out there with gordon and michael for a few hours then dana, lindsay, and i decided to hit up the sauna.  We were just sitting in there and this other michael guy who was there from amsterdam and working for a few months came in.  I had met him earlier in the day and thought he was kind of cute... he has that european look i guess... longer dark hair, dark eyes, dark complected, bad at speaking english.. you know the drill.. so i kind of started flirint with him while we were in the bar.  Anyway, so he came into the sauna and a few minutes later lindsay left then another few minutes later he proceeded to tell dana and me how he used to be a big drug dealer and was driving a jag by the time he was 17 from drug money and that he had done like every kind of drug there is and was living this crazy life that he decided he didnt want.  so he wanted to quit dealing but if he stayed in the netherlands he would have been shot, so he decided to travel and ended up in australia.  he also said he got alcohol poisoning when he was 15 and drinking with his aunt.. i dont know a bout that.  Anyway obviously i was creeped out and decided it would probably be wise not to flirt with him anymore.  Then we just stayed in the sauna for a long time... way longer than is good for your health and later gordon came in earlier and him and michael kind of started fighting and dana and i left.  it was a crazy first day.  Saturday morning i woke up at 7:15 because i didnt have a watch and i didnt want to sleep all day so i sat outside on the veranda and did some work on the paper for the journal of nutrition.  Eventually everyone got up and running and we went out to wineries at 12 again, but this time we were on our own and were walking to the different places.  We had bought a thing of this awesome cheese the day before and a thing of crackers and bread and pb and j so we made sandwiches and packed crackers and the jar of cheese to picnic later.  Then we hit the wineries.  I actually think I found more wine that i liked that second day.  After our second one, or maybe it was third... it was the third, we went outside and had our little picnic then went off to a fourth winery.  then it was about time to meet up with the 4 from emory to get picked up and taken back to the hostel.  On our way there we kind of stopped off and hit one last winery and then found the van.  Then it was back to the hostel.. a bunch more people had checked in and so michael was busy with them for dinner, so he gave us a voucher for $5 off a meal at the brewery right down the road.  We went there and ate.. the food was really good and i got it for $10, which is really good for here, so i was pumped.  Then the wallabies game came on and we went into another room and watched that on the big screen.  At some point amsterdam micheal came in and decided that he needed to sit by me, so he talked to me the whole game... the dangers of flirting with people before you know they are drug lords and such.... they ended up losing 19-22 and basically blew it.  they so should have won.  then the bar attached to the restaurant, brewery, and the lounge had karaoke so we went into there and watched that for a while.  there was a bachelorette/bachelor party there and they were getting all crazy, so it was funny.  After we left, we hit up the hot tub again, thankfully amsterdam michael didnt find out, otherwise im sure he would have came too.  Then it was shower then bed.  wow, im getting tired of typing this.  sunday we rode bikes over to the hunter valley zoo and i got to feed a kangaroo and an emu and petted a koala and a freshwater crocodile and saw various other wildlife.  Then we went into town and got garlic bread and stuff to make pancakes, which we didnt make before we left.  then we left for sydney at 5 and were back home around 8.  then i did a bunch of work.  that was the weekend."

"event","ok. i was not in a bad mood or being morbid about the bird thing... it is seriously just a fact that the birds sound like dying children or toddlers being choked or something like that.  it sounds painful.  im serious.  

ugh.. i still havent written about saturday and it is already up to another weekend for me.  alright.  saturday... i dont think i did anything.  i had a philosophy essay due monday and i pretty much wasted all day trying to make myself start it.  finally after dinner i started picking out examples from the reading i wanted to use... did that until about 2am then went to bed.  sunday a bunch of the butler kids went to a sydney swans AFL (aussie rules football) game.  It was REALLY fun.  and student tickets are just $16 and you get free public transportation to and from the game just by showing your ticket.  sport here is SO much more accessible here than at home.  anyway the game was sydney vs. the brisbane lions and sydney kicked butt.  the score at the end of the game was 124 to 45 or something.  we also did this little contest among the study abroad kids to pick the leaders score at half time and then at the end of the game.  i was off by ten or something at the half, but i picked 125 for the final, and it was 124 so i won this bad@$$ sock cap (beanie) that is one of those old school ones with a puff ball on top and a stripe on it with swans written in the stripe.  i am basically in love with it and wear it every day.  too bad winter is over here.  that's fine, i'll just rock it when i get home at the beginning of december.  the weather for the game was perfect and the play was good.  yea, it was fun. at one point ""the wave"" went all the way around the stadium 6 times in a row while there was an injury time out.  those aussies love their sport.  oh, and i wanted to get a jersey or something but the cheapest one was $90, so i passed on that, but they did have these sweet buttons that had this crazy red and white background and then a picture of one of the player's faces on it and their name underneath and jen and i decided we wanted to get one, so we got barry hall buttons (he is my new personal hero).  After the game allie, vassar jen (as opposed to just plain jen), matt, non-gay alex, and i think the other jen, and i took our free train into the city from olympic park and decided we wanted to check out chinatown and get some dinner/supper.  I hadn't been yet, so i was kind of pumped about it.  two new things in one day.  so we went and got some dinner and i got some awesome lo mein with king prawns.  we kind of walked around and looked at the cheesy chinese souvenir shops and alex bought this inflatable kangaroo that i might just steal the next time i am over at his place.  Then we went home.  I finished up my essay then monday came around.. class.. tuesday.. class.. wed... tons of class.  then we went to the palace that night... last night... which started out pretty boring-like but ended up being fun.  for some reason the GW basketball team is doing a little 10 day tour here and playing exhibition games and they were at the palace.  it was funny because there are little to no black people in australia and they were all really tall so they got tons of attention.  jen and i were hanging out with this guy michael and just in the couple hours we were with him he had 2 men who were complete strangers buy him a shot.  they thought he looked like will smith.  he doesn't.  anyway, it was fun talking to them and we might go to their game tonight in the city.  we'll see.  today i have class at 10 then i'm meeting phil-daddy's friend rob for lunch in town then i have a philosophy essay to perfect and a hunter valley wine tour to book for this weekend and a journal of nutrition article to work on.  plus this game, potentially.. and i'm supposed to go to the city with jac and tiffany... crap.. that's a lot of stuff to do.  good thing i woke up before 7am.  carpe diem."

"event","i'm going to assume i left off at last wednesday and start from there.  that night, for some reason, allie, erin, and i decided not to go to the palace.. for the first wednesday since we've been here.  we just stayed in and did girlie things like straighten erins hair... it was really fun, let me tell you.... :\   thursday i got my butt up at 7am.. took a shower then got ready and started walking to school at 9am and it just happened to be the coldest day since we have been in Sydney.  Now THAT is ambition.  Went to class and all, then on my way back i ran into yale ben and we had a little chat.  he was like, you didn't go to the palace last night, did you?  i looked and didn't see you.  yea, that's right... he was looking for me.. (napoleon dynamite-esque ""yesss.."")  Anyway i think that's about it for thursday, if i did anything that night other than stay in, i don't recall... wait... that's right. Wedding Crashers came out in Australia that day and I went with Jen and her roommate lauren.  somehow it turned into american night at the theatre.  there must have been some kind american bat call in the sky or something leading us all there, but anyway, that's how it went.  The movie was good and a bunch of the Brown kids were there and we ended up sharing a cab on the way back with this brown guy Tom.  Him and his buddies were going to coogee bay hotel and he was like, yea you guys should come.  so jen and i were like, what the heck.. its a block from our respective apartments, might as well... so we walk in and this guy who had to be at least 40 asks as we walk by if we are americans... not one to just let being called out as an american go... i said yes and stopped to ask him why, after we had only walked half way across a room he could tell we were american.  He said we all have long hair and chew gum... i guess that was acceptable... but I wasn't chewing gum at the time and said that a lot of aussie girls have long hair... so then he went into this whole thing about how our skin looks softer than the aussies but we are tanner than brits and so on.  he also said i have an american face, which intrigued me because he said that jen didnt really.  i still have no idea what he meant by that.  i said that i couldnt believe that he could just pick us out like that and he said not to worry about it because americans are generally well-liked here and i said that the girls dont like us.  then he said you're a pretty girl, you take all their guys, what are they supposed to do.  then i got really creeped out and left.  i was a little creeped out before, but that sealed the deal.  and the fact that he was old enough to be my dad.  on to friday.  i didn't do anything during the day, as i was saving my energy for the opera.  erin, allie, and i were all dressed up and decided to get pasta that was the price of the time we at at Barzura at 5:00 and ordered some wine with it.  Rachel ate with us too.  Then  Elena came when we were done and we all hopped the bus to circular quay at 6:35.  we were supposed to be at the steps of the opera house at 7:00, which was definitely not happening.  I dont think we were really even into the city at 7.  so then we had to be there by 7:20... so it was basically 7:20 when we got off the bus.. so we started running in our heels, down the pier with all of these people dressed up and eating dinner out on the walk and staring at us, all dressed up too.  It was actually kind of funny.  Anyway, we got there and got our seats.  The opera we saw was Nabucco, which is about Jews and the Assyrians and some others... i dont really know because i kept dozing off during it.  don't get me wrong, it wasnt bad, the story line just wasnt that exciting to me.  Anyway i would doze off and suddenly the italian words would be ome different english ones and be the narrative of my dreams... it was kind of cool.  The opera house has really cool bathrooms (they just say toilet here) too.  I think that might have been the coolest part.  After that, allie and i decided we wanted to stay in the city and started out walking around in the rocks, which kind of like a historic district and they have some high end shopping and galleries.. and of course, clubs and pubs, but didnt see anything there that was too appealing, so we started walking up george street and ended up going quite a ways and finally just went into star bar, which i had never been in.  It was ok.. i think the crowd was pretty young though.  we found out they have some good deals for girls to drink during the week though, so we might hit there instead of scruffy murphys some night.  we left there and i suggested we go to three wise monkeys because we were dressed up and they have a little bit stricter of a dress code there.  we went up to the third floor, which is where everyone dances and ended up talking to and dancing with these two american guys for a couple hours.  i swear that is always how it happens, there are four americans in the room and they automatically find each other even if they are trying to find australians instead.  so anyway allie was dancing with this 24 yr old, then i found out that the guy i had been sort of dancing with was 30!  i was a little/a lot freaked out, and thinking why isnt this guy married or in a serious relationship by now, but they were nice and fun and they were buying us drinks, so we said what the heck and stayed there until about 2am.  then we wanted to hit scruffy murphys even though most of the people there would be tanked by 2am.  sure enough, they were.  we ended up not staying there long.  15minutes max, then it was back home.  all-in-all it was an entertaining night and i enjoyed it.  whoo... i would go on now to the rest of the weekend but im tired of typing and youre tired of reading, so maybe tomorrow.."

"event","updates... umm just class and stuff.  my first assignment is due on monday, a philosophy paper, we'll see how that goes...  last night erin was in our room and kathleen called, so she came over, then these aussie guys, who i had never met, called her so they came over, then erin texted these irish guys, who i had never met, so they came over and we had a little multicultural fest in our room for a little bit.  It was an interesting collection of accents, I'll tell you that much.  We decided to go down to Coogee Bay Hotel and chill out there because, really, it was almost too many people for our room.  So we hung out there and Erin talked to the irish boys because she is in love with one of them and i talked to the aussie guys and kathleen kind of floated around.  The guys bought us a beer and were so impressed that we drank it because apparently girls here don't drink beer, which I didn't know, and then we sat there and contemplated the differences between aussie and american sports.  The guys were really cool and hopefully we'll be mates and hang out a lot.  They love to quote american movies, though.  Hearing them say stuff from anchorman and old school is so funny.  imagine this big ruby player-ish guy saying ""we're going streaking through the quad"" with an australian accent and hopefully you will find it funny too.  
That kind of has me thinking about differences between america and australia... let's see..
a shopping cart is a trolley.  chips are potato chips and fries.  hot chips are fries but if they don't say ""hot fries"" it is still up in the air which one they mean.  a trash can is a bin.  trash is rubbish.  a kebab is more like a gyro and it is not a shish kebab on a stick.  root means to have sexual relations with, so you don't ""root, root, root for the home team, if they don't win it's a shame....""  they don't have white corn chips, like tostitos.  they have original doritos, which are plain yellow corn chips, but they are no tostitos.  a cuppa is a cup of coffee or tea.  a cell phone is called a mobile.  thongs are flip-flops.  they don't say downtown, they say they are going to the city.  boxed wine is goon.  they don't have cheddar or american cheese here.  basically all they have is parmesan, mozzarella, and this kind called  tasty cheese, all of which are white.  there is no yellow cheese, how racist is that???  it is seriously a kind, not just an adjective.  cookies are biscuits, or bickies.  candy is lollies, american football is gridiron.  when they say the letter ""z"" they say ""zed,"" which i think is kind of funny.  
i think that is all i can think of right now..
ok... bye"

"event","Friday night I didn't do anything.  I decided to go on this bushwalk with the outdoor club on Saturday and we had to get up at 5 to get there on time, so we reckoned (aussie word) that it would be best to just rent a movie.  There were 5 of us who went on the walk and about 8 who stayed home, so we rented Closer and watched it.  Plus, I was all freaking out because i thought i lost my credit card and when i called the stupid credit card company they wasted like 5 minutes of international cell phone time and then just hung up, so i had to call again and waste more time, so i ended up using all of my minutes and i still cant make any calls because they wont let me recharge, for some reason.  Anyway, Saturday and I got up at 5 to walk to the bus with Anne, Al, and Bryan at 6, to catch the bus at 6:15 to central station, to catch a train to Cronulla, to catch a ferry to Royal National Park.  By the time this happened, we had been awake for 3 hours and had yet to really DO anything.  So we started this bushwalk, which was supposed to be something like 26k long, and it was all going ok.  our guide didn't really know where he was going, but it was fine.  So we saw some awesome cliffs and awesome waves and awesome beaches and were kind of stopping at our leisure to take pics and admire the views.  At one point we got to this little creek falling into a waterfall that ended in a man-made pool with a stone wall.  It was gorgeous (there is a pic of it on my webshots) and was overlooking this big valley.  We decided that we would eat lunch there and then got back on the trail.  A little later we got to a car park with a map and a marker saying we had gone about 10k, so we still had tons left to go.  We kept walking and walking and walking and finally got to the top of a big hill overlooking the best beach that i have seen since I've been here.  There was a group of old people sitting on the hillside eating lunch so we asked them about how much we had left to go and they said they reckoned it was about 2 hrs. worth, so we decided to stop and chill out on the beach and take a swim if we wanted.  We pulled out of there at about 3 in the afternoon (keep in mind it is winter here and gets dark around 5pm).  We kept walking and the path turned into this crazy up-and-down-over-cliffs thing that started to be a little more physically demanding than the first 13k or so.  So we're going.. we're going and the group starts to kind of get split up because people went up hills at different speeds.  It ended up that like 5 or 6 of us Americans were kind of leading the way and off by ourselves.  Well, we managed, somehow, to get off of the coastal path and onto somehting else heading straight up a huge hill.  We were almost to the top before we saw a guy and asked him where we were and he said it was the wrong path and we could keep going on this up to the road, but even then it would still be an hourand a half to two hour walk or we could go back down the coast and take the right path but it is going to get dark and it might be more difficult to walk that in the dark than the road and since it is on cliffs and we didnt have any flashlights, we didn't really want to start tumbling down the hillside and then fall off a cliff into the ocean from some misstep or tripping over a root or rock.  But people called us back down the hill, so we started back on the right trail and it started getting dark.  Our group kept walking and it kept getting darker, until when it was almost dark we found another group of people.    We found out our ""guide"" was up ahead and those people had a couple flashlights, so the kinds from our house and another guy here from butler kind of formed a coalition of the willing and decided to haul @$$ over the trail and try to: no. 1 get out of there before it was pitch black and no.2 get to the train station in time to catch the train home.  We were really booking it and eventually were just walking on faith because we couldn't see where we were going at all.  Finally, we ran into our guide and told him that there was a group way behind us and he shoud probably go back and help them, so he did and kind of gave us sketchy directions on how to find the train station once we found the road.  So, two more people joined our group and we started powerwalking by the light of cell phones, because we REALLY couldn't see anything now, and realized that we had no water and we were all really dehydrated and didn't know how far we had left to walk.  Eventually, we got to a kind of parking lot overlook thing with one car parked in it with the windows all steamed up.  we felt really bad, but we didnt know how to get to the station, so we knocked on their window and asked them.  They kind of gave us sketchy directions too, so we started walking up the road and saw this little sign that we couldnt really read with our cell phones, but interpreted to say that the station was down a right turn about 400m, so we got really excited and started walking really fast that way and we got to a fork with another sign and we interpreted that the station was 150m down the path to the right.. we walked that way and were walking downhill toward the station, but away from it.  We took this other path to kind of cut back toward the station but we ended up standing about 25m up the hill from the station and having no idea of how to get down to it... we didnt really have flashlights, so just going through the bush wasn't really all that appealing... so we decided to go all the way back up the hill... we called our guide, tristan, along the way and he said to just meet him back in the parking lot with the other group, so we finally were all together again. tristan said we missed the train and all of us were hungry and dehydrated and just tired so we were going to try to find a pub to get some beer and water and food, but when we got to the cafe in the town (Otford) it was closed and the owner said there weren't any pubs in town.  So, very dejectedly, we made our way to the train station.  The ticket machine there didnt work and there was no one else around at all, and the last train of the day was coming at 8:20, so we decided we would just get on and if they said something about it, we would just say that the ticket machine wasn't working.  Then Tristan got the idea that we should order pizza and have it delivered to the Otford train station, in the middle of nowhere.  We had an hour to wait, and it was getting really cold, so we went for it and ordered 6 pizzas, 3 things of garlic bread, and 3 cokes.  They ended up getting there right as the train pulled up, so we grabbed the pizzas and hopped on the train without any tickets and got a car to ourselves and pigged out.  That pizza was so good, and there was some stuff on there that i had no idea what it was and would not have eaten it under normal circumstances, but, things being as they were, it was the best pizza i had ever had in my life.  So we caught the last train back to central station, then Al lost his phone and ran it back down, we caught a bus back to coogee, then walked very slowly back from the bus stop at the end of the beach back to our house.  Then Allie, Anne, and I rushed the showers and then basically called it a night.  That was Saturday, and it was definitely an adventure.  Sunday I did some reading at the beach and then came back to take a shower and get ready for church and you know the story after that."

"event","no time to really update tonight... but wait for the one about this weekend, because it should be pretty good unless i get lazy about it...
also, i get the feeling that eating a meat pie disturbs some people.. i avoided it for nearly a month, but really its no big deal.. it is basically a chicken pot pie with beef instead of chicken, no vegetables and the crust is much better than the frozen pot pies at home.. that should clear some things up about meat pies.  they are actually quite good..
one more thing... just watched australia lose their 3.5 day test match (the ashes) vs. england by a mere 2 runs.  it was actually really amazing and very very very close considering the total scores were somewhere over 250 or something.  anyway, that was the excitement for the night.
oh, i went to church again too.  they didnt sing the our father this time, just said it.  
anyway, that REALLY is it for now.. i have tons of work..."

"event","Wednesday I had 5 hrs of class in a row... i think i have already written that... ok so wednesday night is basically american night at the palace, unofficially, anyway, and so, of course, we all went.  the theme was trailer park, for some reason. i didn't know the palace had themed parties, but i guess they do.  It was a pretty fun night, relatively, but I had an early class the next day, so my fun was limited.  The class was at 10am and was a philosophy tutorial, so i had to go and ended up forgetting to ask allie to set an alarm so i woke up a little late.  anyway, it didnt matter because i made the bus and got there in plenty of time.  That was the first day that it rained since we got here on the 11th.  It was also founder's day at uni, which is supposed to be the biggest party on campus of the year and people walk around campus all day drinking and wearing crazy outfits.  (for some reason a bunch of the guys dressed in drag too... i don't really know what that was about)  I was a little disappointed because the weather was bad and so the turn out wasn't all that great, but it had a little potential.  They had bands playing out on the quad and some other random stuff going on, but i have to say that rites of spring is in a whole other league.  I was basically just boy-watching with Alex, which got a little old after a while.. He is supposed to call the next time they go out to Oxford street, though, which should be fun.  I ended up going home pretty early and got a meat pie (my first one ever) on the way home.  it was pretty good, i guess.  That is one of those cultural differences.  we get taco bell or wendys at 2am... but the only thing open that late in coogee is the meat pie place... 
Today i havent really done anything.  i went out to the beach and read for a few hours, other than that, now im chilling with the housemates watching old school.  home alone is on at 8.30 and ill have to make sure to catch that one."

"event","Haven't written since class was over last week.. now it is basically over for this week.  Let's see.. last thursday I went out and read and people-watched at the beach all day.  Same thing on Friday.  Friday night we decided we were going to go into the city, which ended up being pretty fun.  We went to a bar called Three Wise Monkeys, which was pretty expensive and also they wouldnt let Kelly in with us because her shoes had the wrong kind of soles.  It was pretty ridiculous.  So she was kind of wandering the streets of Sydney and went to Scruffy Murphy's where webb and andrew and some of their friends were, but we never really knew if she got there or not and anne and i were kind of freaking out about it all night.  then all of the sudden travis and brett were gone from 3 wise monkeys and we didnt know where they went. (they had decided to go to star bar for some reason) and then i want to say that we lost ben/tyrone too, but i dont really know.. at any rate, anne and i finally decided to just go home and we didnt want to catch a bus or pay for a cab so she called this aussie guy michael and he drove into town and picked us up on the corner (i know it is probably hard to see how a night with a description like that could be ""pretty fun,"" but it was, just trust me) and then took us home.  The next morning I was talking to Mollie, who had also been at the bar the night before and she was like, did you see that guy get stabbed?!?  and i said, no, what are you talking about?  and she said that when they were trying to leave 3 wise monkeys at like 1 they couldnt because some guy had gotten stabbed with a broken piece of glass right outside.  i kind of freaked out a little because anne and i were out there standing on the sidewalk for some time waiting for michael to pick us up.  oh well, no use worrying about it now because its over with.  Saturday morning i woke up feeling horrible with a bunch of pressure in my head and a sore throat and a gross cough.  I proceeded to talk to my parents for a long time and then went shopping to get some medicine... and qtips, nail polish remover, post-its, toothpaste, band-aids, body wash, and exchange a sheet(i accidentally got a single)... to be exact and to keep a complete account of the day.    As soon as i got back i became a complete sick bum and just sat around.  that night i watched 4 rugby games, give or take one, while the rest of my housemates went to king's cross (the red light district) and had a great time.  its a good thing i didnt go, though, because they were out SOO late.  Some got back at 5 am, some 6, and one at a whopping 8 am.  i would have died.  i still want to get up there some weekend, though because it is supposed to be pretty interesting/fun.  sunday i was a bum again and did some homework and then, im such a good kid, i went to 6pm mass at st. brigid's which is about a block and a half from our house with erin and allan.  mass was good. it was pretty much the same as at home (as i had expected) but they didnt hold hands for the Our Father.  they didnt even hold their hands out... and they sang it... so us three were sitting there singing the prayer and holding hands for a good 3 minutes and it started to get kind of weird half-way through.  Allan just gave up on it and stopped holding hands in the middle... but erin and i stuck it out through the whole thing.  that night we had house movie night and half of us crammed into our common room and watched the scent of a woman.  it was good, but we started it way too late and it wasnt over until 1.30 or something and i really wanted to go to sleep because i still felt bad.  monday i had class at one and i dont think we did anything monday night.  tuesday, more class and then kelly, travis, webb, struges, ben/tyrone, and i went to scruffy murphys.  it was umm... ok.. i guess.  there werent very many americans there, which was good, and i talked to 3 aussie guys for some time, which was fun/interesting, but we had to come back early, because, after all, we are here to study, and also we had two cab drivers who tried to screw us over, which sucked.  oh, a little side note, they dont have Crest in Australia.  That kind of makes me sad.. or Tostitos.... which makes me much sadder.  Oh, and you cant find turkey lunch meat either.  everything is fifty kinds of ham.  So then today i had five hours of class with no breaks... 10am to 3pm.. it was a long day.  And for my last class, i hadnt had it yet because our professor didnt show up last week, i had written down that it was in biomedical theatre b and so i went there and saw ben/tyrone outside and was like what are you doing and he was like what are you doing and i said that i had an english class there and he said where and i pointed to b and he said no... you dont.  and i was like, oh crap.  he had his tourism class there.  so i was totally lost and had to go across campus to find a computer then find out how to find my schedule then check it and the class was in biomedical theatre d. so i went back to the theatres and was thinking oh, its fine its a lecture hall so no one will notice me being 15 minutes late.  i went through the door and it opened to the front of the lecture hall.  anyway, my entrance wasnt very stealth.  haha... this morning i woke up and looked at my watch and started to freak out because i thought it said 10.30 and so i threw on some shirts and started to get my stuff together then stopped for a minute to freak out some more and was like there's no way it is past 10 already so i got my cell phone and checked the time and it was 7.35.  everyone who has ever heard me say im not very good at telling time... i wasn't lying.  then i went back to sleep for a few.... 

gosh, i totally forgot about the thing at the unibar last thursday.  so the unibar is the bar on campus and every thursday, apparently, they have big parties and drink specials and stuff so we went last thursday and it was ok... aussies are HORRIBLE dancers and im pretty sure there is that opinion that white people have no rhythm and can't dance.  and there was this sketchy ass aussie trying to pick me up.. it kind of makes me mad because they are so freakin obvious about it and their pick up lines arent really all that great.  this particular guy tried to tell me that i was better looking than jessica simpson, that she wasnt that good looking, to which i said, im a GIRL and i think jessica simpson is hot.  anyway he was nice, but i sort of kind of tried to get away from him at one point and he followed me and kept trying to get me to dance with him... i eventually ran into webb and ben/tyrone and just started talking to them and the guy went away.  i saw him later dancing with allie, and i was secretly thinking allie, no, dont do it... but anyway... i met up with lindsey and dana and they informed me that rob had just thrown up in the middle of the floor by the table he had been passed out at and got kicked out.  i was just sitting there talking to them and all the sudden this american guy justin or josh or something (i had talked to him twice before) comes flying out of nowhere and throws this guy adam, who cam through butler with me, into a bunch of chairs, so naturally, he got up swinging and they started fighting, kind of more wrestling than fighting, but fighting, anyway, and then some guys came to break it up and webb tried to break it up too so the justin guy gave up right away and kind of backed off with his hands up and disappeared then he kind of circles around through the crowd and jumped out onto adam again... this time they werent letting go and it took like 4 security guards to pull them apart and then they were kicked out.  it was a little bit of excitement for the night.  Anyway, when i was talking to the 3 aussies at scruffy's i was complaining about how aussie guys are so sketchy and they were just laughing and i kind of assumed they werent as sketchy because one of them works for the study abroad office at school, but it was kind of funny because they just assume that all american girls really like them...  which is kind of true but so of them are so blatantly just trying to pick the americans up that it is annoying.

"event","my classes were done for the week at 2pm yesterday (Wednesday) so now I'm going to spend 4 days at the beach, hopefully get a little sun on my pale buns... or i guess arms and legs would be more accurate.  as for classes, my 60s class is awesome, polisci is ok, i have yet to have an english class but we are reading really good books, so hopefully it will be good, and philosophy is torture.  I have fallen asleep in both the classes we have had... our lecturer is just NOT interesting.  She's horrible, and I, personally, am not that enthralled with philosophy anyway.  I will just have to start drinking coffee before class, even though it is at 1pm and i should be awake by then.  
off to the beach!!"

"event","I have had requests for more information on my toe situation.  I see now what kind of sick people you are... the american media has brainwashed you to seek blood and violence.  anyway, the foot hurts.  I have to walk holding my big toe up, so my ankle is rolling, which is not good either.  no, mom, I cannot keep my foot elevated because I started class this week and I have to walk around on campus.  Also, I cannot wear shoes, only flip flops, so that puts me out of the club scene for a while because I cant meet the dress codes.  I suppose that I am ok... just in pain and I have to look like an idiot limping around campus all day.  Although my panicky housemates who were treating my toe the other night wanted to take me to the hospital, I talked them out of it and said i would go to the doctor on campus yesterday.  I went and they couldnt get me in, so my appointment was for 3:30 today, but that is too late for stitches anyway, so I just canceled the appointment.  I washed it out with a bunch of antiseptic last night and put some bandaids and neosporin on it... so hopefully it doesnt get too gross.  I like my feet too, so this makes me kind of mad.  i guess i should be glad that it didnt totally take the chunk off because at least with a flap of skin over it it will heal faster.  Enough about my mangled toe... gross... To answer another question, a Tim Tam is a cookie (biscuit, here) and it is basically thier oreo.  they use them to lure chocolate lovers in and addict them so they never want to leave and are forced to marry aussies.  they are chocolate cookies with chocolate filling in between them and they are dipped in chocolate.. plain, i could take them or leave them, but in a tim tam slam, however, they are that amazing that i can understand people not leaving or at least having them shipped to the US for them.  The cookies are rectangular and you bite off two opposite corners and then take a cup of tea (everyone drinks hot tea here all the time, and it has definitely grown on me too--peppermint's the best)and you put one of the bit corners in the tea and suck through the other bit corner until the tea goes into your mouth then you eat the whole cookie at once and it is all disintegrated and delicious in the middle.  mmmm mmmm good.  it is actually amazing. 
Now on to school.  Yesterday was my first day.. awww.. i know, how cute.  My classes started at 1 and went until 3... long day, i know... i could hardly handle it.  First was philosophy 1007, then english 2301... my only non-introductory course.  There was still no lecturer there at half past and some people started to leave, but finally the head of the school of english came in and was like... peter is overseas... he wont be back for class on wed. either... so we dont have a lecture then either.. It was cool.  Today my 60classes started basically at the crack of dawn, 10am with a two hour lecture on international politics.  That was followed by an hour of hist 1015: the us and australia in the 60s, which looks to be some fun.  That was followed by an hour and fifteen minutes in the bookstore getting my required reading and then the trip home. I found a place that will sell me a concession bus pass too, although we are not really eligible for them.. and that's today and yesterday"

"event","I'm going to kind of summarize up until today because I don't want to get hopelessly behind.  I tried a Tim Tam slam at orientation, and it was great, so one night when a lot of people had just moved into the house and no one had food i made a bunch of spaghetti for everyone and someone asked if there was anything they could get and i had her get a package of tim tams and proceeded to make everyone who hadn't tried it yet try one.  Now everyone is obsessed with them.  You have not lived until you know the goodness of the tim tam slam.  I'll have to bring a couple boxes of Tim Tams back for everyone to try.  Oh, when we got into town, we all got on buses to take us to our respective places of residence and our house was the last one so we were on the bus until 7pm or something and it was completely horrible.  Everyone was so antsy and I had been in a car or a bus since 9am that morning and all I wanted to do was get some dinner, a shower, and curl up in my sleeping bag.  So then we moved in.  We ended up getting a pretty sweet double, but then i saw some of the other housing in coogee and for four people they had a pool and two bathrooms with jacuzzis in them.  I was a bit jealous, but my housemates and roommate are great and we are starting to bond so i actually am glad that im here.  I automatically have 30 friends to do stuff with without using up mobile minutes.  The aussie in charge of our house, Daniel, is pretty cool.  One night when a bunch of people got in we decided to stay in instead of go out and we played Tourettes and shoulders, neither of which i had played before and both of which were very fun.  we started inviting other people over too and by the time daniel got home from work, i guess we were pretty loud, so he informed us that there would be no more alcohol in the house...ever.  I kind of hoped he was joking because there are people living here who are 21, so they can even drink in the US and all of us are legal here and are getting used to our glass of wine with dinner.  Then on friday night we had our welcome party at the palace and daniel went and was pretty drunk and was dancing all crazy australian style and we started to think that he is going to be alright.  He was also being really protective of us girls, which was nice.  People in Australia don't dance like we do, and if you ""American dance,"" as we call it now, it pretty much means that you are going home with the guy you are dancing with.  We are just so used to dancing how we want to and it not meaning anything at all, that it is kind of hard to change.  Plus, you should see these aussies dance.  they look silly, let me  just put it that way.  So anyway, there were three of us up on their dancing platform dancing how we always do and a guy who is here from butler with us was kind of dancing with us and standing around and daniel comes up and is like... do you know that guy?  if any of these guys start harassing you, let me know and i'll kill them, basically.  And he kept doing that throughout the night.  One of our house girls Sherry had her purse stolen too and he was like, if i find that guy.... im going to beat him up, or something of that nature, but it was pretty cute.  All-in-all, he is a good guy and he's a lot of fun too.  My roommate Allie, is from Washington and goes to Washington State at home, but she was in Queensland at Townsville last semester so she hasn't been in the states since last February.  She is awesome and so nice and we have a good time together.  Erin Nusbaum lives in the room next to me and she is fun and great too, so we have a good time.  Ok... so what have I done since ive been here.  The first day we had a little shopping fiasco because we didnt know which buses to take or where to go in the first place, or which stores were where and it took us forever to end up at big W (their equivalent to wal mart, more expensive, as is everything here).  Then I got home and found out that, although i have a double bed, i bought a queen size quilt (not really a big deal) and single size sheets (a little more of a big deal), but ""no worries,"" right?  The next day I can't remember what we did, but it was probably great, like everything else and the weather was beautiful.  I've been to the palace and coogee bay hotel, they are great.  I went on the walk from coogee to bondi and it was gorgeous and amazing and i was with erin and we took tons of pictures and saw a wedding party in 3 matching black mini coopers standing out on one of the cliffs, which was cute.  Then we passed the bowling club and saw some old men bowling out on the lawn that was basically at the edge of the cliff.  It was fun.  Bondi looks like it would be fun, but the beach isn't as big as I thought it would be.  Oh, and on the way there is this awesome cemetery with all of the graves facing the ocean and it is kind of creepy, but it definitely shows you how much aussies love the water.  In america that space would definitely be occupied by some high rise hotel, but not over here.  Another little side note, on wednesday night for an hour at the palace, you can play rock paper scissors with the bartender for free drinks.  I think that is kind of funny.  We also went into the city... that was on Saturday and it is, again, awesome and gorgeous and I want to marry it.  I need to think of some more adjectives to use.  Fantabulous, maybe.  So we took the bus into Circular Quay and then took tons of pics of the opera house and the harbor bridge  and then walked around to the royal botanical gardens, which are, by all accounts, fantabulous.  They are in the middle of the city and are bordered by the ocean and there is a lot of green grass and palm trees and other plants that I dont know and statues and cute little kids playing and people picnicking and when we were there, there, there was a couple getting married, right there overlooking the Pacific.  Once again, aussies love their ocean.  After that, we took a little ferry ride (fun) over to darling harbor and walked around there.  It was pretty cool.  That is where the aquarium is, and there are a bunch of play things for little kids to do like bungee trampolining and playground equipment and and IMAX and paddle boats and mini golf and the like.  There is also some shopping and some restaurants and a lot of seagulls.  We got kebabs for lunch when we were there and sat on a picnic table by the water to eat them and the gulls were everywhere, along with these evil looking birds that are white with black heads and feet and these long pointy, curved beaks that look like they are just waiting to peck your eyes out.  I am kind of afraid of birds, mainly sea birds, and these black billed ones really freak me out.  One walked under our table while we were eating and i picked my stuff up and stood 5 feet away from the table the rest of the time we ate.  After that we walked into the central business district and saw the tower thing... center point tower, maybe??  We didnt go up in it, though, because tickets were $22 and we knew we could get 11 boxes of tim  tams for that or anything else we wanted.  There is a bunch of shopping right there and even under the base of the tower, though that I would like to check out sometime.  That night we caught a rugby union game on tv and gained some appreciation of aussie sport, but i already liked it, so i guess my appreciation just grew.  Sunday we bummed around the house most of the day, I uploaded pics and such and then at 4 allie and i went out and sat on the beach and watched the waves until the sun set, which was... super?... wonderful?... fantabulous and then came in for dinner and such.  we watched napoleon dynamite as a house and three people hadnt seen it and were thoroughly entertained and it was fun to watch them watch it.    I thought I was going to fall asleep just sitting there, though, so I went up to the guys' floor and sat and talked with erin, ben, and andrew.  I had to use the bathroom, or use the toilet, as they would say here, so i decided to just run down the hall and use the one on the second floor.  I was wearing flip flops and everything and right before i went into the bathroom i felt something in my foot, but i really had to go so i went in to pee and looked down at my foot and my flip flop was full of blood and i was thinking oh, no what have i done.  so after i went, i hightailed it back to aj and ben's room, leaving a trail of blood in my wake, and sat down as soon as i got inside their door and they were like, what are you doing and then i took off my flop and there was blood everywhere.  It turns out that i had nearly sliced off a sizable chunk of my big toe.  I couldnt really feel it, but the guys started to panic and more guys came and started to panic and got erin, who had just left, and they tried to help me clean it up and get a band aid on and they kept making such a big deal about it and then saying that they were going to take me to the hospital and then i started to worry about it and it started to hurt, basically in proportion to the amount that they fussed over it, so I started crying and then we got it patched up and i wanted to go to sleep so i went upstairs and threw my pillow and quilt into the hall and wasn't going to sleep in my bed and get blood all over it, so i ended up downstairs on the couch in the common room with one foot hanging off the side.  This morning when I woke up, It killed and I hobbled up to the third floor and took off the blood covered and soaked bandaid and tried to clean it up a little more.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I couldnt get into the doctor today, so it is too late for stitches, even if I do need them, and i had to hobble around campus all day on our first day of campus.  good first impression.  
ill write about classes tomorrow... for now im beat and my foot hurts and im going to go eat some ice cream.  
P.S.  I could really use a hug."

"event","Just got back from our study abroad welcome party at the palace, and even though it is 1 am, i am pretty wound up as I have been dancing for the past 3 hours, at the least, plus my feet are killing me so much i dont think i could sleep anyway, i didnt really have supper so im too hungry to sleep, and wireless is working well right now, so on with the story of my trip.  basically nothing happened on our farm stay.  The place we stayed was basically like any farm.  it was also freezing cold and rainy.  Their three year old, Nick, made things a little more interesting with his antics and I also thought the grandpa who was living with the family because his wife just died was pretty amusing.  We basically just sat around the whole time.    At one point, we watched a little tv.  It was all old american stuff, like bewitched.  At one point we went on a small walk around their property, at one point we read magazines for about 4 hours, at one point we started a ridiculously hard jigsaw puzzle, at and two points we played some euchre.  The food that the lady made for us was pretty good, with the exception of the lamb chops that they made on the barbie, but no one else was eating any of it, so i felt like i had to eat absolutely everything because i felt bad for her having made these extra large meals because of our presence and no one would even try them.  I actually started to find it kind of rude that they would never try her cooking.  Normally what a nice person would do would be to thank them graciously and try it, then if they didn't like it, not eat any more, but that didn't happen.  Anyway, the farm stay was a pretty good opportunity to catch up on sleep, but other than that....
After the farm stay we were driven back to Bathurst to meet our buses to go to SYDNEY!!  Finally, after being in the country for a week.  Oh, one more thing.  I learned some things on the farm stay.  In Australia, football is gridiron, you can live for 40 yrs without seeing a koala in the wild, not all Australians are super-friendly, Australian magazines are about $7.00 a piece, and Australian malls contain butcher shops. That worked pretty well in making me tired.  I'll write later this morning about the first hours in Sydney because IT'S SATURDAY NOW!!!  the last weekend before classes and I should have some time to get a couple days worth down before heading into downtown for the first time!!!!   g'nite"

"event","So now our wireless works on and off, so I will try and write when I can.  So I last wrote that Australia was somewhat less than what I had anticipated.  All of that has changed because now where I live in Coogee Beach it is gorgeous every day and it is still the middle of winter here.  Anyway, once my plane got in, I met up with the other kids who are here from Butler and we took two buses up into the blue mountains (some pics are up now, by the way).  I had kind of thought that the whole orientation thing was going to be really dumb and boring and I was going to hate it, but it turned out to be great.  I met a bunch of cool people from all over and the other 6 girls who are here from Vanderbilt.  The first day we got to the Christian youth camp where we were staying for the orientation, we basically just unpacked and then went on a little walk to see the sunset, but we left before the sun set, then some of us made it to dinner and fell asleep right after dinner at 7:30, while others just fell asleep as soon as they claimed a bed.  We got up at 7:00 the next morning and were all still really tired, but we had a full day of stuff to do.  In the morning we had an info session and learned some academic stuff and stuff about our Uni.  In the afternoon my group did some bushwalking, and I chose to do the Grand Canyon trail, which was supposed to be more challenging than the other, but I was basically expecting the Grand Canyon and so it was a surprisingly easy hike.  The trail was beautiful, with ferns and palm trees and waterfalls everywhere-- it felt like we were in a jungle, only without the sweltering heat.  I took a lot of pictures and they definitely do not do justice to what it really looked like in the canyon.  It really was amazing.  While we were at the bottom, they had us write a ""journey letter"" to ourselves.  I don't really know what the specific purpose of them is, but they are just a letter to ourselves that the Butler people keep and give back to us right before we leave.  We had just had a lecture about going outside of our comfort zone and trying new things and making the most of our experiences here, so I decided to write about my goals while I am here, things like, don't complain, try new things when you have the opportunity even if you think you won't like them or they could end up being really embarrassing, and such.  So then I didn't complain for the rest of the hike out of the canyon when most of the other girls were.  I was a little proud of myself.  Then that night after dinner we had a little session on aboriginal culture and the main guy who was talking was really hard to understand and had a shaved head, a mustache, and a big belly and was always talking about eating lizard fat and it being beautiful.  He also called the smell of this resin made out of some plant beautiful, but I beg to differ.  After he had talked at us for about an hour three guys and four(?) boys came in and did some of their tribal dances with their white paint on and made some of us get up there and do them with them.  The dances were... umm.... different, and by the end of the dancing the whole room smelled because, I assume, the dancers did not use deodorant.  Then it was off too bed at the extremely late hour of 9:40.  The next and last day we spent in the Blueies was my favorite.  I had made some friends by then and everything we did that day was something new for me and also potentially embarrassing (I was sticking to my goals).  In the morning I went rock climbing for the first time, which kind of sucked because all 3 of the climbs they had set up were pretty hard and I definitely did not pick the easiest one and I had no idea what I was doing and also it was freezing cold and as soon as you were out on the rock for 2 minutes your hands were totally numb so it was hard to tell if your hand was going to stay where you had put it.  Anyway, I finished the climb but my arms were sore the next day.  I am definitely glad I went ahead and did it, though.  Then it was lunch and another info session and then some informal instruction in cricket, aussie rules football, and rugby.  That part was really fun too.  There were about 12 or 15 or us who decided to go up to the oval (field) to try it out and we were pretty horrible-- especially at bowling in cricket.  But I had never played anything that we learned, so I was excited to get the chance to play and actually learn what is going on in the crazy game that is cricket. (Aussie rules football is pretty darn crazy too...).  Then we decided to play a pick-up game of touch rugby and split into teams.  The other team had our outdoor guide Ray, who is Australian, so he knows the game better than us, and also happens to be pretty fast, and some other guy who I found out as soon as the game was over won a state championship in rugby when he was in high school.  I think my team lost, as none of us really knew what was going on, but it was still great.  That night, after dinner, we had a bush dance.  We were all thinking that it was going to be dancing like we had seen the night before, so we were leery about even showing up to it in the first place, but because I had made a vow to myself not to give up on things before I even try, I went.  The leader of the band that played was wearing crazy colonial dress and had huge white lamb chops and white hair.  When I saw him the first time, I kind of laughed.  I felt bad afterward, but I did... I kind of laughed.  Anyway they started out with this story of the origins of the bush dance and that they used to all go to the water hole (billabong) at the end of the day and stare into its waters and they had us all stand in a circle and stare at the floor in the middle of the room.  At this point I really did think it was going to be like the night before, but then they started playing the hokey-pokey and the craziness began.  Bush dancing is apparently some crazy kind of square dancing incorporating dances originating from all over Europe.  It was so fun and even the guys who decided to show up loved it.  Then that was the end of the day, to bed around 10, up at 7, packed and breakfasted by 9 then on buses to Bathurst for our farm stays.  There were 3 other girls at my farm, The Farmers Arms, Sara, Sam, and Lexi, and our stay was, to say the least, uneventful.  We didn't really do anything the whole time.  The family we stayed with lived about a half hour out of Bathurst and had an angora bunny, a horse, a sheep, a rooster and two hens, four cows, two dogs, and a cat.  We saw the animals, which i had all seen before.  Oh, I forgot to say that I saw my first kangaroos up in the mountains.  They were always out on the oval and came out to watch us make fools out of ourselves trying to play cricket.  OK, this entry is definitely excessively long, so I'm going to cut myself off for now and pick up here tomorrow.  for today, cliff top walk from coogee to bondi, getting my student ID, and rock, paper, scissors tonight at the palace and tiffany's 20th b-day!
Oh, yeah, I set a ping pong ball on fire in our common room this morning.  I could have burned that mother down.  There were four people standing there just watching it burn.  I know it doesnt sound funny, but it really was."

"event","I love lamp.  No, I don't, I LOVE WIRELESS!!!!!!!!!  That has been a pretty sore subject around here, because as is evident by my lack of entries, we have had no internet and since we can't really call the states, we are basically lost.  Plus to be dropped into a new city where you can't look things up online is really crappy and causes you to look like a complete idiot a lot of the time.  Anyway, enough about that.  I have much better things to talk about than wireless internet...
So I'll start from the beginning: the plane ride(s).  Basically everything was fine and I made all my flights and all my luggage got here.  I set foot in California for the first time, which was exciting.  Actually it really was great because we flew into SFO when the sun was still setting up at 10000 ft. but it was already dark on the ground so the city was all orange lights and there were clouds running from the ocean out in a strip through the middle of the city and I couldn't tell what was cloud and what was ocean because clouds kind of ripple like waves and it was pretty dark.  It was basically beautiful.  The flight from SFO to Sydney was.... LONG.  I'm not sure that I really like international flights even if I love flying and was on a double decker plane for the first time in my life and they kept giving us meals like every 4 hours.  Oh yea, they served dinner at midnight which kind of sucked because people were starting to fall asleep and then had to wake up again.  During the ride I sat in between an English woman and a woman from Brisbane.  She was pretty crazy, to use an adjective.  She told me a little about Australia and she was coming back from New Hampshire to see her son who had married an American.  I didn't really sleep much on the plane despite taking 2 melatonin tablets, so jet lag hit me pretty hard once I got here.  Our plane got into Sydney at a little after 6 am on the 11th and it was cold, windy, and kind of rainy at the airport.  Australia's first impression was not all that great, actually.  
Ok... that is good for now, I want to keep you in suspense.  Out to sushi tonight with almost all of the people in my building then into the city for the first time!!!!"

"event","Today is my last day in Nashville and my last day of work.  Basically the paper I was working on isn't finished yet, which makes me kind of mad, or I guess disappointed, because I have been working on it since January and won't even be here for the finishing touches.  I do have to say, though, that the figures that are going to be in that paper are quite good (everyone needs to give themself a pat on the back once and a while).  When the paper is published, whenever that may be, I'll have to put up a link to it on here as it is my first real contribution to the world.  Then I will google my own name to see if it shows up.  So that's work.... 
I just got my address today and I think it is a good one.  I have no real way of knowing, but if I had to guess if it were a good or bad address, I would pick good.  It is also just across the street from the beach, which by my standards means it pretty much is impossible that it is a bad address/place to live.  
Ugh.. I was just thinking that I really do have a lot left to do before I leave, but I don't really want to think about that any more right now.. there will be time Friday to get things done.
Last night, my last night here was kind of bad, i guess??..??  I went to Jackson's with Lorielle, Stephanie, Patrick, and Blake, which was fine, but I guess I was sad because I was definitely out of it.  Lorielle saying that I wouldn't be able to leave once I saw her naked body wasn't even as funny as it is now thinking about it.  I don't know..  I'm obviously really excited to go... it is just sad to leave too.  And when friends come up to you and are like, no, you can't go, I kind of think, why would I want to leave people who want me here?  But then I know the answer.. surfers, australian accents, scuba diving, kangaroos, and koalas.  Which makes me sound pretty unsentimental.. but like the magnet on my roommate's fridge says, ""Life is short, but wide.""  So I'm going to go exploring, see what I find, and in all likelyhood, be back at Vandy in the spring.... but if not, of course, everyone is free to visit ;)"

I think Im going to look into getting one for the semester...

"event","So I'm starting to get some stuff lined up, only 24 days left..., and, seriously, there is no way I can pack for this.  It is hard enough trying to pack for half a year in only two suitcases, let alone when you are asked to bring a sleeping bag and hiking boots along with other normal things you would be taking.  That is basically a suitcase right there.  Sigh.  Also, I am supposed to pack anything valuable (ex. laptop, camera, etc.), anything I might need in transit to Sydney, and a weeks worth of clothing, winter clothing, that is, a rain jacket, a fleece, tennis shoes, long pants, blah, blah, and those hiking boots and sleeping bag into my CARRY ON.  The legal size for a carry on is more-or-less the size of a sleeping bag.  What do these people want from me??!!"

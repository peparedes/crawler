"event","well i am an aunt...again-but yeah my sister-in-law had her baby! his name is mayson, he is so small, i cried when i first held him.  i know-i know-im a crybaby but jason thought it was sweet so it made me feel not so stupid.  im having mixed emotions tho.  i thought andrew was the guy i KNEW i was supposed to like but now seeing lil' mayson and getting a new breath of fresh air to life im liking someone(s) new.  it's plural tho becuz i have more than one-my mom is calling me absolutely boy crazy.  i've had boy problems in the past but now everything seems to be amazing.  and the dudes im crushing on deserved to be crushed on-lol-they are very cool home dawgs.  

and i have made some friendships/relationships in the past year that i want to forget.  i know i sound mean but it's the truth-some of my friends are telling me not to waste my time wih them, and they are right...im 14-going to high school i don't want to worry about crap like this---im done!

  we had another tournament this weekend-this was state. we took third out of 18 teams.  it was so hott and humid today-being in the catcher's uniform i thought i was going to die-or heat stroke...one of the two.  but this morning i hit a homerun!  it was sooooooo awesome, it felt good to hit that ball so hard nobody could catch it.  well we have company in from las vegas so i better go spend some time with them-it's weird i talking to this thing like it's a person-ive gone crazy...see now im talking to myself-i can't wait til' brooke sees this...she's gonna laugh hard...later days"

"event","watching u-watching me
can't u see we were meant to be
touching me-touching u
i want u more than i think i ever knew!

so far away but very close to the heart...
we were never meant to be apart

we've been friends for a short while
and u always seem to make me smile...
u don't understand what i feel for u
becuz in the next minute u are talking about someone new...

why can't it be me?
open ur eyes and see
that we have eternity 
and u need to spend it with me!

don't let ppl get in the way
becuz i can't wait for long...
another u is coming by and i might let his love carry me away...

**wow that is a GOOD poem-thanx brooke for writing it and letting me paste it in my journal!"

"event","<font color=""green"">Yesterday I came to work early again - about 5 hrs earlier - then we had a really pleasant walk on the boardwalk in Vetnor - the scenery was simply unbelievable - darkening sky with dark blue and pink coloured clouds on the horizon.. a bit too windy, some silly-looking sea-gulls and a lot of kids... </font>

<font color=""magenta"">I messed up my sleeping habits.. worked till 3 am, then I was going to go straight back home and ""hit the sack"" but Pee and Nehneh (or whatever the spelling of her name is) said I really had to try some drinks at the ""B-bar"" before I go back to Bulgaria - so we went there - it is on the casino floor and it is a cool place..  I drank some really excessive in sugar and vodka drink full of ice and cherries on top - didn't hear the name becuse the music was loud... now all the caffeine in my blood makes me sit here and mess up with people I wouldn't normally do on the internet... hm.. shouldn't do that .. I guess..</font>

<font color=""orange"">Now chatting to a friend not seen long ago.. actually seen only once a couple of years ago...</font>"

"event","<font Arial color=""gray"" size=""=+1"">I quit one of the jobs so I could spend more time enjoying my last weeks here in this other world ... The whole night before wednesday I had a really interesting discussion with my roommate Van (vifko) ... i have to admit that I was a bit manipulative and misled him to try and prove his impossible to prove statements and he got really frustrated when in the end I confessed that actually he can't beat my arguments because I have authoritative source of knowledge on that particular topic because I have translated parts of the textbook on the same matter... He got mad at me and said ""Goodnight!"" .. well.. because I got to sleep at about 5 in the morning and was supposed to get up at 8 am, the next morning I couldn't get up for work on time and was too late even to call out.. and the weather was sooooo beautiful.. and I decided that it was a clear sign for me to put an end to my ""Boscov's"" misery - just decided not to call and not to show up.. and I don't care.. I guess they will be forced by the new circumstances to fire me though I have to take my last paycheck... anyway - it is not so important.. 

Went out, walked to my bulgarian friends' place on the boardwalk but as usually there was nobody on the basement floor - so I rang the host's bell - Anne was at home and we haven't met for quite a long time - actually the last time I saw her was when I started in ""Starbucks"" at the ""Borgata"" - she was glad to see me again and offered me to join her to the movies in Ventnor.. While waiting for Anne to get ready used her phone to call Kalina - found her in a bus in Paris and while talking to her I could hear all these occasional french language around her in the bus - she told me her flight had been OK but there were too many bills in her mailbox when she got home so she felt like taking the first flight back to New York because here in the States everybody was so nice to her and she had felt like a spoiled child here ... 
The movie theater in Ventnor was a really old one and the ticket was only $3 which made me feel suspicious which later proved to be reasonable - the movie was called Dirty Pretty Things - movie by a British director Stephen Frears who is known to be one of his country's most ""vibrant and recognizable"" filmmakers - my opinion: the film was a piece of CRAP! .. well I may sound too critical but I think it was very manipulative and made as if the director had followed some subtle drama-making rules - make your audience feel worried and shocked by the dramatic plot then make them hate the bad guy and love and pity the good guy who (of course) has a beloved one (but they will never be together no matter how strong is their love) and then a happy-end in which the bad guy gets it, the protagonist tells the girl ""I love you!"" and she tells him the sam - but it is too late because she is on her way to New York to seek her fortune .. and the main character finally calls back home in Nigeria to tell his daughter ""I am coming back home"" - eyes full of tears... past murder, recent murder, former love, current love, immigration, syphillis.. all of the actors were foreigners - I doubt there was a British actor in this British movie - and I am 100% sure it was done on purpose - and this dramatic pathos in the ending lines said by the main character - it was too much for me.. so to summarize - a British movie with main character - a Nigerian named Okwe, who was a doctor in Nigeria but was forced to live his country by some reasons carefully kept in secret till the very end of the movie, he worked in a London hotel and all the other employees were with a foreign origin - a maid (the protagonist's gf later in the movie) in the same hotel called Senay who is illegal immigrant from Turkey, the doorman was a Russian guy, and my favourite was Okwe's boss who is Spanish... Things become interesting when Okwe finds a human heart(!!!) clogging a toilet in room 510 of the hotel... then it turns out that the Spanish guy is making illegal operations on illegal immigrants who are willing to give their kidney for an ID to become legal... 

At 18:00 I met Steph in front of the library and we went to see the Crazy Guy's House.. i think it was in  Mays Landing and I think this guy is really crazy ... and his house has a lot af old stuff collected inside.. then we drove a lot without any clear idea where to go. .. Steph got tired and bored from all this driving and we went for a walk on the boardwalk.. when we got back we couldn't find her car which was towed meanwhile.. so we had to find the towing service parking which was almost as far as San Francisco.. but it was fun anyway.. and I got tired from all this writing :)</ont>"

Well.. I have three weblog journals at the moment and one of them has two branches.. and I feel that I will end up not knowing what I wrote where and what to write in each of them.. may be I have to separate them by topic or something like that</font>"

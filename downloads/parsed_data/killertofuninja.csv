"event","Last night I had a dream that someone had been breaking into my car and leaving my friend's dead bodies in my car with threatening notes that were written in blood. The attornies at the office were trying to help me figure out who was doing it. The killer would slash the throats and stomachs of his/her victims with a huge knife ensuring instant death. The killer was clearly after me but everyone kept protecting me but the killer was too efficient and always killed my protectors.  Every single one of my bristol friends died in my dream, along with everyone at my work place. My friends from northeastern then came to help me solve the horrifying mystery. The killer seemed to be no where to be found but suddenly he/she appeared and then right before my little brother was about to be killed Annie jumped on the killers back and Jason shoved a saw through the killers stomach. The dead killer was unveiled and ended up being one of my coworkers whom I hate hate hate hate. This dream had many more details than what I'm writing here but even though it was just a dream I feel that it was quite symbolic. I have a couple ideas of what it could be but leave me a comment and let me know what you think."

Oh well it's gonna be a SICK concert and it's at TT the bears and I really like that venue so I'm wicked excited. I also found out today that I have NO FINALS so my xmas vacation starts on December 6th, but I'm not going home till the 8th becuase Murder By Death is the 7th and I'm going to that one for free! :0) I don't like Bristol but I'm excited to be going home for breaks because I'm starting to get lonely here and missing my friends back home. I need a cuddle buddy here at school desperately."

"event","What the fuck Morningstar!? All I ask of you is to make me delicious veggie burgers, I never asked for you to put a free sample fajita burger in the box of veggie burgers. I was looking forward to eating your delicious product, but you had to ruin it by tricking me into eating your free sample. Honestly, if I wanted a fajita burger I would have bought them. Next time I eat a veggie burger it better be straight veggies, none of this fajita buisness. So fuck you Morningstar! If you plan on putting free samples in the box I recommend that you LABEL it a little better."

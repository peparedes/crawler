"event","I feel really good. I do. I dont know whether its the preceding events of tonite or perhaps I am just on a natural high, but I feel sublimely happy. I am in one of those independent, self-suffecient moods, and I must say I am loving it. I realized today that I am happy with myself. I dont need a boyfriend, friends, or anything else to make me happy with myself cos I am content with who I am. It is not to say that I dont enjoy the pleasure of their company, its just I function just as well without them. You see, earlier this evening my boyfriend Aaron and I came to a mutual agreement to take time apart. Now I am not saying we are taking a break from one another, but we talk wayyyyy too much, and it is time to focus a bit more attention on other aspects of our lives. Which I think is a great idea. I came to realize he is not the only thing that makes me happy, I make me happy too. I didnt want room to breathe so to speak because I really thought he was the source of anything good I had felt. Well, that is only partly true. He does make me happy, but I dont need him to feel that way. And now I am thinking that talking less is exactly what we need to become a happier couple, but more what I need to become a happier person. I need to learn to rely on people less, and not to let them affect me as much. I used to be so independent. I want to return to that me-myself-i lifestyle. I shut people out of my life because I was convinced he was all I needed. Bad idea. I cant put all of my faith into one person. I cant invest 3 months of my life to one single person. So now I am learning to sort of allow more people into my life. Chris, for instance. Which I believe to be a great thing. We talked as if nothing had ever happened between us. He really is a beautiful person. I believe part of me still loves him. You cant date a person for a solid year and not maintain a peice of your heart in their possession. But anyway, were are friends now, and I have a feeling that we will just end up being friends in the long run, it makes more sense. 

I love Aaron. I really do. He is someone I can really see me spending my life with. He is contagious, and you cant help but love him. But there is no guarantee he will be around forever, or even tomorrow. But I will be. So it only makes sense to believe more in myself than other people. I sincerely hope he is the one I wake up next to for a long long time (he looks so cute asleep). I dont know though. I guess its only normal in any relationship to have doubts. It takes work. Were too young to have to work so hard at any one thing, so I propose we just play it by ear and instead of being two people who are together, just be two people who enjoy the pleasure of each others company, because that is all you can be sure of. Just a carefree union. No rules, no animosity, no bad feelings. Just someone to rely on, a best friend. Someone who goes out of their way to make the hard times easier on you.

So now I plan on rekindling old friendships. and strengthening current ones. Friday I plan on going to this huge party with Jake and his friends. He really is an awesome kid. Even if he is a perve. I decided that my girls and I dont nearly see enough of each other, so were gonna hang out more in the near future. I also want to talk to my father about maybe flying Chris out to see me during the summer, for maybe a weekend or something. And I dont want mine and Kyle's relationship to suffer at all, even after he LEFT ME! lol. were going to be two peas in a pod like old times. I know we promised to act like that kiss didnt happen, as I know it was just something he needed to get out of his system, so it should be no trouble going back to the way things were.

I think that sometimes, in life, you just hit a few bumps in the road, a snag. But eventually, its your belief in yourself that gets you through it. It isnt Jesus, it isnt your friends and family, they simply root you on, its you. You are the source of all of your happiness and all of your displeasure, and its up to you to decide which is more prominent. Well, I choose happiness, because life is too short, and so is my fuse. I have made a choice to try my hardest not to let problems, especially those out of my control, effect my life. I am a strong, intelligent, passionate, mature 16 year old girl, and there is no excuse to act like everyone else and take the easy way out. I am all I've got, so I figure why not make the most of it?"

"event","Okay, people have become increasingly more boring lately, and its actually pissing me off. My friends especially, if you cant handle the pressure of an engaging conversation, then please conveniently lose my number. They will call me and do one or even many of the following:
1)not talk at all, just dead silence 2)talk, but small talk. Do you idiots really care what happened to me in the past 20 minutes since we last spoke? ""how's the weather?"" YOU KNOW HOW THE WEATHER IS, JACKASS! 3)constantly repeat themselves. ""I miss you"" ""how are you?"" ""whats up"" ""ummmmm"" ""whats wrong?"" THIS IS A MAJOR INDICATOR THE CONVERSATION IS GOING NOWHERE, HANG UP AND CALL AN IDIOT HOTLINE! 4)just talk about themselves. chances are, if you do this, I probably dont like you much anyway, would I really want to hear about your latest ""crush""? No, I would rather cover my face in molten lead. 5)THIS IS A BIG ONE: be preoccupied. (ie. watch movies, talk to other friends that are over, answer other phone calls, do homework, play video games, listen to music insanely loud, etc.) If you are busy having friends over or playing your fuck ass video games, why call me? honestly. If you want to be an assclown, do so. But dont involve me. I dont want to have to compete with other people for your attention, if you are busy, finish what you are doing then call me. I think I deserve a one-on-one conversation once in awhile, I have to put up with morons 24/7, I think I have earned a decent conversation on occasion.

now I know sometimes I am guilty of some of these things, as I am on the phone right now while typing this. But, if I do these things, chances are YOU ARE A SNOOZE! so please dont call me if this applies to you. Also, if you have at least 2 braincells you will be able to see this all applies to phone conversations. Rest assured that if any of this happened face to face, I would simply walk away without having said a word, this is how you know you are boring me to tears. Take notes, kids..."

voustoucherjuste: really? need a shoulder to cry on?
lamentablexagony: that is not funny
voustoucherjuste: Im not laughing, Im crying. Im always crying these days, woe is me *sob*
lamentablexagony: SHUT UP!
voustoucherjuste: may I quote a favorite song for you?
lamentablexagony: ummm, i guess
voustoucherjuste: ""my hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me, so wont you kill me...""
voustoucherjuste: ""so I die happy""
lamentablexagony: that is your favorite song too?????
voustoucherjuste: yeah, my supposed loathe for dashboard is just a facade, I secretly love them
lamentablexagony: well good
lamentablexagony: they are the best
voustoucherjuste: suuuuuure are
lamentablexagony: you have good taste, what other bands do you like?
voustoucherjuste: there are alot of good bands out there, but I really like the juliana theory
lamentablexagony: OHMIGOD! me too!!!!
voustoucherjuste: do you think I am serious?
lamentablexagony: ummmm yeah?
voustoucherjuste: HAHAHAHAHA
voustoucherjuste: you poor, lost soul...
lamentablexagony: ummmmmmm ok *runs away*
voustoucherjuste: this is an instant message conversation, why would you run away? are you that much of an idiot?
lamentablexagony: I dont know, maybe
voustoucherjuste: ahhh so you agree its possible. I was thinking more along the lines of ""definately"" but ok, baby steps...
lamentablexagony: you are a snot
voustoucherjuste: how kind of you to notice :-D
lamentablexagony: ugh *walks away*
voustoucherjuste: awww I'm sorry, I didnt mean to hurt your fragile feelings, dont leave. I didnt mean it. Please dont wallow in your own self pity, please?
lamentablexagony: ok
voustoucherjuste: ok
voustoucherjuste: did emo change your life?
lamentablexagony: YES!
voustoucherjuste: why?
lamentablexagony: I dont know, it made me learn to be more in tough with my emotions
voustoucherjuste: yeah, no shit 
voustoucherjuste: wait, you meant in touch, yes? cos tough and emo dont belong in the same conversation
lamentablexagony: I am tough
voustoucherjuste: let me ask you something...
voustoucherjuste: ""waaah waaah waaaah, woe is me, my heart is broken, I have bad luck in love, i shall never love again, *sob*"" does that sound very tough to you?
lamentablexagony: maybe emotional masculinity is the trend, like ""the new black"" its in
voustoucherjuste: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
voustoucherjuste: one to many queer eye episodes yes?
voustoucherjuste: wait, I thought part of the ""primary main objective"" was to alienate yourself from the rest of society by wearing clothes that dont fit and having your cheeks become water-logged from all the tears your ""woeful eyes do shed"", what would YOU know about whats ""in""???
lamentablexagony: emo isnt just about being sad 
voustoucherjuste: then what is it about?
lamentablexagony: its about experiencing a whole range of emotions
voustoucherjuste: well I experience a whole range of emotions, in fact, my emotional peaks and valleys are more diverse than anyone I know, and I certainly am not emo
lamentablexagony: its about the music
voustoucherjuste: you mean you listen to MUSIC too?!?!?!?!?!
voustoucherjuste: where do I sign up? when does the next bandwagon leave so I know when to jump on?????
lamentablexagony: the music is emotional
lamentablexagony: its amazing
voustoucherjuste: its something alright, i dont think amazing is the right word though
voustoucherjuste: and what are you talking about? all music is emotional
voustoucherjuste: you cant argue that one ""genre"" of music is more emotional than another, human emotion is human emotion. your happiness isnt anymore or any less vivid than mine, your sadness isnt either. your argument holds no water.
voustoucherjuste: you more or less like what you like simply because emptyV told you to. they started playing already redundant Dashboard songs and you, like the little scenester you are, decided it would be befitting of the moment to hum along to ""screaming infidelities"" and viola. you have yourself a trend. a bunch of boy band wanna be's suddenly dying their hair black and writing poetry? thats unheard of... and then there came emo.
lamentablexagony: whats emptyV?
voustoucherjuste: MTV
voustoucherjuste: which contradicts itself, if I might add
voustoucherjuste: you cant make a television network catering to music if you arent going to play music on said channel
lamentablexagony: dashboard confessional IS music
voustoucherjuste: no, its some prettyboy doofus with too few braincells to fully experience any human emotion, trying to be as profound and poetic as humanly possible trying to write songs with a very basic melody, and trying to pass it off as music. when really all a person of sound mind would hear is ""my hopes are so high, that this song will reach number one, but my music is sucky,I should be shot"" 
lamentablexagony: I am gonna go, ill talk to you later
voustoucherjuste: ok, tell your mommy to pick you up some tissues at Tears R Us"

"event","I recieved alot of praise from my last ""emo post"", but also alot of silly scenesters bitching at me and whining as to how emo does exist and emo is what they live for and waaah waaah waaah. After offering them some tissues, I quickly jumped into presenting my  evidence that emo ISNT REAL. It cant be real. Its just an illusion. The scene is like a bad dream that you wish you could wake up from but instead, everywhere you go you hear a dashboard confessional song and it makes you want to eat lye. No wonder these kids are so sad and ""woe is me"" look at the ""music"" they listen to. If I was tricked into liking that shit I would probably be broke from all the kleenex I was buying too.

Honestly, the word ""emo"" pretty much speaks for itself. I dont understand it. I know its short for ""emotional"" but these kids spend all their free time writing deep,  meaningful, depressing poetry and they cant fully pronounce the word EMOTIONAL???? Does anyone else see a problem here? ""emo"" is, in itself, a STUPID word. It sounds like something you'd name a sock puppet, like Lambchop. In fact, I propose that someone start a scene called ""lambchop"" and everyone can hot-glue cotton balls to their flesh. It would be just as ridiculous. Only then, Little Bo-Peep can pop out from behind a bush and beat you with her silly stick/scepter thing for being such an IDIOT!

"event","I'm having a good day. One of those days when you feel that no one can piss on your parade. Even my mom telling me I cant get my sweet ass camera even after I've saved the money for it didnt bother me. Why? Because I know what I want and how to get it, and not her nor anyone else is going to come between that. And after I save the money, if it is still what I want, and even if she protests, I will buy the camera. It is not up to her to say what I should do with my money. So therefore, I am happy. I am content. I will be an unrelenting force because I know what I want. For all of this, I am going to give myself a pat on the back. Because I think I deserve it. I am so down on myself all the time, and so negative and I think I'm maybe a bit too hard on myself. I really think I have alot of good qualities that would be more evident if only I learned to accept them. So here is to realizing my true potential, whether you disagree, I still think I'm am a pretty good person.

"event","Despite what you think, emo does not exist. I dont give a flying yellow turd how many stupid scenesters I piss off by making them realize all their striving for ""emo-ness"" is in vain, because emo simply cannot and does not exist. Its an entire scene based upon the combination of punk music with emotionally driven lyrics. Now exclude the ""punk"" from the equation (for the mere fact that it IS NOT PUNK MUSIC) and all you are left with is the emotion aspect of this music, if you can call it such. By following the same standard, we are left to assume that Garth Brooks is, in fact, emo. Because his music is emotionally driven (but honestly, what music isnt? the only reason for  one to write music is to write about an emotion or an experience. so i guess, technically speaking, almost ALL music is emo.) so thats right all you emo idiots...throw away your Dashboard albums and buy some cowboy boots, its time to whip out some Garth! He's the new emo god, and praise Him you shall.

I'm gonna steal all of my boyfriend's roommate's (he has a name, yes i know, haunting. and it is *gasp* Jessie) Yu Gi Oh action figures (this kid is 19, by the way, what the fuck is he doing with toys at college?)and he'll look high and low for them for about a week. and of course I will be laughing on the inside as I watch this. muahaha. anyway, after about a week, I will spray paint them all neon colors, and super glue them upside down to his ceiling while hes asleep or gone.(i secretly  hope one falls on his dumb head while he's is off in dreamland...) and then he will see them and be like ""WTF, mate?"" and then while he is almost having a seizure from the confusion, I will staple about 30 little pine tree air fresheners to his repulsive body. I'm hoping this will shock him into realizing that he needs to clean up his act, and maybe shower once in awhile and stop fucking playing with toys similar to what my ten year old brother owns. I'm done.

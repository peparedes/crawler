"event","hey people, i havent been on here for ages because i have just got the internet back in. Well the situation finally resolved itself with andrew... i now live with my mate beth who i knew from college and after two months of singledom now have a new boyfriend called richard. He is 27, a head chef and plays rugby :)he is lovely, not my usual type but that has to be a good thing because the rest of my exes are complete and utter evil people lol. But yeah, life is good, hes not clingy, im not rushing into things and things are going well.
I went back to uni for my second year aswell and this year i am getting my head down and getting stuck in because i have my future to think of. I now have a lil law library going in the living room next to beths sociology library. I have never had so much fun as the fun i have had since i moved in here, i can go on nights out and i can also have a laugh in the house. i never had that with andrew, i used to go to uni, go to work, come home to andrew, make the tea and then go to sleep... with beth its different... i do my uni work, have a laugh, i am actually happy.
And i am also very happy today because i managed to get priority metallica tickets! XD i have wanted to see them live since i was like 11 or something... they are my alltime favourite band.. ac/dc coming a close second but i couldn't get tickets for them because ticketmaster kept crashing and then they sold out in 4 hours :(

Btw for anyone who actually reads these... i finished faith.. the book i have been writing for like three years now

"event","i have only been single for three days and have recently got myself back onto msn and stuff. last night i was told off two different lads that they liked me as more then a mate.. i was like woah... hold on, im still heart broken over andrew and u guys are trying to get me to go out with you? i mean way to get someone who is vulnerable. i cant wait to get my life back, i am getting back with so many friends who i lost contact with when i was with andrew. i guess u can only truelly analyse a relationship once u are out of it. i am listening ot disturbed new album atm and loving it. i have found a bunch of stuff to knit for ehen i move in with beth on sunday because we wont be getting the internet in until later, but i will definately be getting it in. i hope that andrew realises that he cannot afford the flat that we shared without his dad and i hope that he has to move out of it, because he had a slight problem with impulsive buying, like we would get paid, pay the bills, i would buy the food and then he would go look i have bought u a hamster and i would be i dont like hamsters lol and he bought an air rifle and we just didnt have the money so i am glad i dont have to cope with his debt. YAY! slipknot comes to the arena in december!!! i have been wanting to see them live since i was 11! YAY! *does funky dance* well in the words of d:ream: ""things can only get better...""

well i had better get myself to work

"event","well i aint posted on here for absolutely ages! well first of all, me and mr mangina are no longer going out. basically the twat went to hit me... so i told him to fuck off. i have been in abusive relationships before and he knew this. and ten i found out a few days ago that not only has he been shagging one of my best mates behind my back but they started seeing eachother 2 days after we broke up.. looks like he didnt think much of me. this happened over a month ago and i only found this out last week. 
Well i pulled over a week ago now and i hope that he is not just a rebound becuase he is lovely. he's called simon and he plays rugby. me and him have a lot in common and i am going to take this one slowly. i dont want to get hurt again.

i have had a really good sleep last night because i dreamt that i beat up both paul and steff (my so called friend). i think i must have really needed to.

i cant wait until tonight its gunna be great. im qute pissed off tho because i have agreed to go out tonight and i was really looking forward to it... to find out that my EMA hasnt gone in.. yet again! i am so pissed off! i mean, i was in all of my lessons... and i remember donna apologising to me for not marking me in... but i am realy annoyed.. i mean... i have no money now to go out with :( i just hope that si has money. i have been wanting to see FM now for over a year and tonight i was goingto go and see them... :'(

"event","i dont seem to post on here as muuch as i used to... im sorry for that. im starting to realise just how much people can bullshit at college. i always try and see the good side in people but now this is just taking the piss... people lying about such important stuff... like being pregnant ( lorna has claimed that she is pregnant), being thrown out of thehouse (once again lorna)... etc.
why cant people just be who they are around us at college. its like everyone has a fucking porcelain mask and they never take it off in public because that shows the real them. instead, its like everyone has a certain image that they portray of themselves and only a select few seem to see the real them...
oh well... also the prom has been confirmed! 11th july, the day before my 19th birthday, so its gunna be fun and also i get to wear my lush red dress... paul says ""he'll think about going""... i mean how can u say that to ur fiance? if he asked me to go to his prom, id be thrilled. its not like he doesnt know anyone at college cos he knows loads of people, so he wouldnt feel left out...

im  quite happy, recently ive been going to sleep for 12 and then being able to wake up for college the next day! and also ive been doing my work for college too. im devastated though, because i may not be able to do the english language coursework i want to. if i cant do this transcript then i wont be happy and i wont get a good grade because it means that i wont enjoying it.

"event","well... ive been at pauls since friday. its been ok, i had a bit of a breakdown on him last night because i had a gud cry, i felt so bad and stuff but i had no reason to be. i have sent sarah another myspace message because i want her to know that i was sorry for doing what i did. basically i was under the impression that she had cheated on me but it turns out that she hadnt and i used to love her. but now im with paul and even though im happy with him i want to still be her friend. Pauls currently asleep but i dont know for how much longer. we were both woken up by pauls mam playing keyboard full blast. so we were both in a bitchy mood. also, he went to sleep about half an hour ago but his step bro just came back with a bunch of people who are making shit loads of noise. bless him. well... i can hear their music form teh living room and he's only in the room next door to them...
ooo i hear stamping of feet and banging of doors i think he might be awake. aww...

right now onto ranting about college. im getting fucking sick f seeing certain individuals which i do NOT want to see, mainly jon and craig. (people who know me will know why, if not, read the rest of my journal) i see them everywhere, jon mainly who is the person i dont wanna see. i mean, just before my law exam i saw jon and my mate ellie actually tried to pull me away, thinking i hadnt saw him. im still walking on eggshells. not because im scared incase they do it again ( they cudnt in college) but because everytime i see them it brings back memories of what actually happened to me. im not going to let them get to me and fuck up this year, i NEED to get my grades, i got an offer through for my first choice so, assuming i get my grades it means that il be going there.

if you guys have time check it out. now i am christian, i wont deny it but this is just taking the piss. according to this website, all goths are potential terrorists. i think melissa will agree with me, that is NOT what being interested in the gothic lifestyle is about. i mean, when i was in my gothic stage ( i still am a bit but not as much, only when i go out) i never went around shooting people and stuff like what they are saying. i find this very offensive because the bible is supposed to be about how you are suppsosed to treat others as you would like to be treated and they are demonising the gothic movement and basically saying that they are big headed. i am christian and i am still interested in gothic stuff...does that mean im going to go to hell? i think melissa and everyone else will agree that this website is talking a pile of shite!

"event","well ive had quite a good weekend for doing sweet FA. On friday night pauls mam picked me up so i could stay there at the weekend like i normally do. Basically all ive done this weekend is revision, snuggled up on teh settee and on pauls bed watching films and tv, ive helped pauls mam, julie, clean up the house cos there is surveyers coming in tomorrow, it is our anniversary, we had fun *wink wink*. I find it funny, i was talking to a friend at college on friday and they were saying that everyone in teh students union had been making bets when me and paul started seeing eachother of how long we'd last, the most popular one seemed to be between a fortnight and a month. well screw them all! today is our 10 month anniversary. Its our 11 month anniversary on calentines day do how romantic is that? well me and paul ahve stopped arguing and everything is going good for once. i managed to get the majority of my college work dome apart fom my english language which i need melissa to give me the sheets for because ive lost them :/ Oh and a great achievement, i whooped pauls ass on soul calibur 3 about 2 hours ago!71 to 57... we wer playing head to head so i got 71 wins! w00t! mind you, he slaughtered me at need for speed carbon. The old paul is back, well not exatly the old paul... the ld paul was a twat, by the old paul i mean the one who would spend time with me and stuff. like this weekend he aint been on msn the entire time i was there. he went on msn as soon as i left to chat to his mates. ARGH! my mam has just walked in and started nagging me, i hate being nagged. its like, she'll tell me to do sumthing and i will, but in my own time, like, i have mor eimportant things to do then to go in the shower just yet, il do it once ive finished my law revision. but she cant seem to understand that the entire world doesnt revolve around her. i mean fair enough i know shes having problems but thats no reasin to take them out on me! id rather her talk them thru with me then shouting at me because she cant cope with them.

"event","i fell like i havent updated this thing for ages! wel first day back at college. it was ok, i got really hyper because i got to see all of my mates that i havent saw for ages. its like, this is gunna sound stuid but i honestly love college. i have so many friends there, and they are all appreciated. i managed to apologise to jeni in person for not going to her 18th and ive just had a gud day. i have my sociology exam on wednesday and then my law exam on teh 19th so its all gud. once i get these out the way il be ok. Things are going good for me and paul (hes ill atm bless him) and it seems like my life is finally getting in order.
My new years resoluions:
get pauls band sorted
sort out my life
be a better friend/daughter/family member/ fiancee

i feel like i havent been a gud friend etc to people and i dont think that people realise how much i appreciate them. i really do appreciate everyone, and even tho i wasnt the nicest person i cudve been, im working on it.
oh and the best thing to happen to me lately.. ive finally gone up a bra size! im now a 34/6 c! i came back to college andsum guy asked me if i had had a boob job lol. the thing is, im quite happy with them now.

"event","well i aint been on here for a while. And first of all i want to apologise to jeni for not being able to come out for her birthday. i havent saw jenny for ages and my mam had arranged for me to go over to hers and if i didnt go over then she would terminate our friendship becaue i hadnt contacted her in nearly a year. And i tried to get her to cum out, but she has alocpecia so she wont go out to crowded bars.
PLus, im getting stressed with exams im trying to revise but the cases for law arent going in and also im finding it hard to revise in general. Its the bullet for my valentine gig tonight so im excited for it.
i was playing battlefields with pauls ex yesterday, now that was funny. she wanted him back and stuff and hes been telling her where to go since march so ud think she wouldve got the hint by now. but i think she got the hint yesterday.
i found loads of pics from my school days yesterday and i miss the good old days. I mean everyone has hanged so much!
My new years resolutions:
. get into uni
. Pass my exams
. be more focused in lessons
. make time for mates more
. try not to depress everyone
. lose weightin a healthy way

Blaze, my puppy's baby teeth are coming out so theres little needle like teeth all over the floor at the minute and he has got into a habit of chasing his tail. He's so cute! he can get a bit vicious at times but thats because he gets hyper. Its just funny though because blaze hates paul. i think its because paul insults him and blaze dont like it. BLESS! Blaze also likes to have something in his mouth to show off to us, hes so cute!

"event","im NOT happy. its christmas eve, and no one wants to spend any fucking time with me! My mam just had a right go at me for smoking in the house. shes saying that its bad for ehrs and jessicas chests ( they both have asthma) i wouldnt mind, but she sits in a room with my dad who smokes like a fucking chimney! Also, paul is over and all he wants to do is sleep! And then i tried to see if my sis wanted to spend time with me but no, she had better things to do... so basically im all alone this xmas, in my fucking bedroom, on the floor ( becasue paul has took over my bed) and i just want to fucking cry! christmas is supposed to be a happy time but at the minute i just want to curl up into a little ball and not have emotions at all. I mean, paul was so loving ot me this weekend and now we are at my house its  like hes turned into mr twat.. i dont know why. I mean he didnt have to spend xmas with me if he didnt want to... but he said he wanted to spend time with me this xmas and all hes done is sleepp. I mean i was shattered this morning but he wudnt let ME go back to sleep because HE wanted coffee and he wudnt let me rest until i made him it.. i just feel like his skivvy sometimes :(

"event","well just came back from my appointment. I aint a paranoid schizophrenic... the voices ive been hearing are just extreme self talk. and im NOT paranoid! i have insecurity issues... and i told him EVERYTHING, i need to learn how to be assertive with anger, and i am in no way aggresive because i dont go around luking for a fight. And i have to see a specialist about my bulimia. The voices are just extreme self talk and i have nothing to be worried about, just my bulimia. they aint gunna put me away yet lol.
i just have a very low self esteem atm and everything but my mates ahve been making me feel loved so woo! im so happy... apparently theres a grop in newcaslte that deals with people with bulimia so im going there.
and plus i have multi vitamins so i can give myself a health boost.

"event","yes folks, once again, im still ill, contaminated with flu. i woke up at 11.30 to hear that paul had rang for me at 9 this morning. He rang me to tell me about how he has the new cradle of filth album. it was quite amusing tho becuase his favourite song on teh album is a gay iconm 0s anthem and he didnt know lmao! i was like they arent allowed to cover that song! and he was like, no, they wrote it.. i just laughed when he realised that he was wrong
i need more sleep, even tho ive spent most of my day sleeping... *yawn* needing more sleep...

my god, ive been up for 3hours and im still tired. I cant believe they are axing bad girls! i m actually quite relived, im a huge bad girls fan but the thing is tho, its went bad ever sdince yvvone atkins died.

"event","i came into college like i do everyday... went and sat ouside my law lesson, waiting for it to start. The thing is, i was playing on my sister's nintendo DS so i wasnt looking around. then i heard a voice saying ""vicky, u know ur supposed to use a stylus for that"", i didnt recognise the voice, didnt look up then said ""yeah i lost it"", then looked up, craig and jon were standing there! They nearly fucking raped me last year! i was promised that they wouldn't be in college this year, but they were... and they were right next to me. i thought i had got over the whole attemoted rape ting but as i saw them it was like the floodgates opened and i retreated into my little shell. they just stood there staring at me as if to say, u thought u cud get rid of us, think again. ive been a nervous reck all day. as soon as they had gone, i went to the toilets (running out of law) and i cried my eyes out and then i threw up. i have threw up twice today. its like ive gone right back to the way i used to be. the person who was very scared of everything and who looked around every corner before steping into a room to se if they were in there. ive been crying for the majority of today. now im safe at home now, i fell a bit better, but im dreading going into college tomorrow, just incase they are there as students. i mean, they might have just been there for the hell of it, which would be better, but they still shudnt be in to start with. 
Also, lorna saw me upset and tried to help me, not that i needed it, ok i did, but i wud have rather talked to either melissa, kayleigh or laura about it then her and she told me that jon has a job in college as a cleaner... now that fucking scared me! i mean if i could let it all out sumhow il be fine... and i need to learn to love myself and i need to stop blaming myself for what happened. i mean for months i thought it was my fault, even though i didnt ask for it, like they went around saying.. i was still seeing paul then, do u honestly think iwould cheat on anything?!?!! im not like that! but yeah, i got al nervous and upset and stuff.... and then when i was on my way home, i saw the fucking slag (shev, as in pauls ex), who just gave me the hackiest look ever... but the thing is, she looks like such a slag, she was wearing these knee high boots... but the thing is, even though i hate her guts and i want her to die, i want her figure... she looks like shes a size 12 ... the thing is i hate her so much, so obviously i saw her a the completely WRONG time.  
i feel emotionally drained now because i dont really know how to cope with this. i mean i thought it was bad enough trying to cope with my recent diagnosis... and i thought i was over this incident.. but i guess not, i mean i cant even be tickled nemore! ok, if u wanna know the story... these two guys were like my closest mates last year. one tuesday they asked me if i wanted to go to craigs ouse for a few hours. i was like ok cos they were my mates, u dont expect this sort f thing to happen. so i went to teh house and they were joking on about how they wanted to do me and shit. i just took it as a joke because i know loads of people who joke on like that. so i just jokingly said, sorry to break ur heart hun, but i dont cheat. then they started going on about how it wasnt cheating if ur in different postcodes... but i still said no (still thinking they were joking). then i asked where the toilet was and went upstairs. when i came out, they called me into the bedroom cos they were playing music and stuff. once again i didint think nething of it because we were such gud mates. Jon was playing on craigs PS2- gta san andreas and craig put music on.. i shudve known fom the music they were playing that they were planning sumting (songs like deny me by soil etc) . Then i just sat on teh bed, having a laugh.. then they both started tickling me and i cant stand being tickled so i fell back on the bed... then they pinned me down.... i now knew that they werent joking nemore, and i started asking them to get off me. they pinned me down harder by my arms and then took their turns to kiss me and carress me... then they started trying to get my belt buckle undone to take my trousers down but i dunno how i managed it but i managed to get out and then i said, i think ud better take me bakc to the metro station. they didnt, so i went by myself and got lost on the way back to college.. whne i got back to college i cried because it had just hit me what couldve happened if i had'nt have fought back. my dad didnt find out about it until last weekend maybe... it happened about may time or june i believe.  I had only just started to give hugs and stuff again and now i let paul pin me down in games and stuff (if we are just messing around) but after seeing them , i once again feel unclean and i want to scrap off my first layer of skin  (like having a skin peel) so i can get rid of this dirty feelig... its that bad. i know what ur thinking, oh ffs get over it already.. well ahte to break ur heart, but it isnt that easy... i thought it was easy, but obviously not.

Until It Sleeps Lyrics

Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open and pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you until it sleeps (x4)

I Don't want it want it want it want it want it
No

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me 'til I'm clean

I'll tear thee open make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps (x5)

the end

if u knew me then you'd understand why that song is so special to me.

well im guna head off now and contemplate revenge... im thinking of posting on one of his mates myspaces saying how id like to do them and see how he likes it...

"event","well last night me and paul had a big argument.. and i duno what the hel i had said.. but we were making rewuests to this online radio station and then when i reqquested the song that we started seeing eachother to (aerosmith- i dont wana miss a thing) he was like NOOOOOOOOOO. So i logged off the radio station and then he messaged me saying they are getting ur metallica song on now but theyve already played aerosmith.. and i just saisd i bet u enjoyed that... (as in a sarcastic thing since he said he didnt wanna hear the song) then he went in a hissy fit saying that he didnt wanna talk to me if i was being bitchy adn that i should fuck off.. so as u can imagine i didnt know what to say and i didnt know what id dun wrong. so i had an ickle cry when i got all upset,, then i told the radio station... so they made a live broadcast for us two to kiss andmake up.. it was sweet of them.. then i said well are we gunna ""cyber"" kiss and make up? and he like yeah,... then ofr the first time ever HE apologised to ME! its like woah, this never happens. then he showed me what had pissed him off and i told him what i meant by it then he went into ""i love you so much"" mode. you see, this is what happens when you dont see the persn u love for an entire week... it was like yeaterday during the day i didnt know what on earth possesed him becasue hes normally very ""not romantic"" but yesterday he was like ""i love you so much vj and u are every thing to me, and no im not drunk before you ask"" and then ""omg! i miss you like mad!"".. i think its true what they say.. absence makes the heart grow fonder...
im hoping to see him either timorrow for a few hours or on monday after college.. so we can make up properly,.. . if u know what i mean... lol
the thing is, even though hes being all romantic and stuff... i keep having dreams.. i know its just my paranoia but they have me waking up in tears... like dreams where i walk in on him and another lass but the one last night was him on msn to me and then he told me he had nearly cheaed on me... then said he had feelings fo rthis lass on the net so i told him to go with her if he wanted to... it broke my heart.I mean i know it was just a dream but it felt so real.. it was unbelieveable.

well id better get going now. i have to go and meet my friend in newcastle.

Im feeling the reprecussions now though.. my head hurts really badly and i feel sick... it aint gud :( . I'm still shattered becasue as soon as i got in the house last night i passed out on my bed. ive noticed how you feel more drunk when you go outside... i felt fine in the bar... it was just when i was on my way to the metro station that i started to feel it really badly. I've had to take the day off college i feel that bad. i feel like pants for it tho because i was supposed to be going with anyana to do her photoshoot using me as a model. i did text her though off the o2 website but i just hope she got it because it would be an awful shame if she didnt get it. I just hope she is ok with me not being in today...

oh god! i still have makeup on from last night! My eyeliner is all over my face and my lipstick is smeared across my face from how ive been sleeping... lol.

"event","well... first of all im shattered because i only had like 3 hours sleep last night becasue paul rang me at stupid o clock in the morning... well 3.06am to be precise... to tell me about this welsh lass who was coming onto him. So that didnt help my sleep lol. ALso ive had quite a good day at college. But theres one thing that is starting to bug me about that place.. all the bullshiters! I mean fair enough, we all have a tendancy to exagerrate from time to time but not to this extent... its taken me months to realise but there are certian people in college (im not naming names just incase they have a lj account) and the things they say are that unbelieveable, u can never tell whether they are lying or telling the truth. the thing is tho, a few of my mates actually believe these people, which is the sad thing. You'd  think that people would see thru them but no... they are just ignorant of theor lies.. well all apart fomr anyana and a few others. Im just getting sick of it!
i mean, why cant they just be themselves around me! Im lucky that i have certain friends who i know i can trust and they know i trust them, but im never anyone else but my self around everyone! i admit sometimes people get freaked out of watever but hey, their loss if they dont want a friend like me!

ok rant over

it was really funy.. but he was being so romantic and then he started to seranade me... which was really sweet (even though it was a durnken seranade). Well i was going to give him two weeks to see if he would change, and i dunno whether men can read minds but he sharp changed over the weekend.

"event","well.. last week was really weird... firstly, i went to the doctors becasue i have a problem with bulimia and when i went i got the diagnosis of being a paranoid schizophrenic, bulimic, depressed and also having anger management problems. im finding it hard to cope with this because i always thought i was fine... well i knew about the bulimia. i need to get help as soon as possible or else i fear i might lose my mind completely. Also i was assaulted on friday night by a drunken charv on a bus... the fucking bitch hit me! so i whacked her back... and went for her throat.. but i still came off worse. so i have the police on the case and everything. the thing is, im gunna sound insane but the thing is, i get paranoid about everything when i know i shouldnt like for instance i get paranoid if a teacher has a go at me. or il get paranoid if i see paul talking to another lass (which is stupid becasue i love him and if i continue on like this then im going to break us up) and just stuff like that. its like everytime im around a big group this voice in my head is saying ""they are all looking at you, you must be a mess"" and stuf... sorry about venting my splein, but this is taking over my life and i cant stop it! ive tried to eat properly but its annoying because now i have tried, im putting weight back on and i get that voice saying ""ur ugly, ur fat, look at u, why the hell is paul with u?? ur a mess!"". if u listen to the song until it sleeps by metallica then you will be able to make a comparison with me.. its my song...
it gets me down. and plus im feeling the pressure of college... its all getting too much for me to take. i mean, i just need lots of hugs and pauls support and stuff.

well id better get going.

"event","I sat in a chair for about 4 hours yesterday just thinking about stuff. When my roommate and Batman came into my room, we all started talking and thats when my mood soured. 

They both started agreeing with what i was saying and that they felt the same way. This made me think that my epiphony was not an epiphony, but rather a disillusionment that ever college student has. Needless to say, that was shitty, because I was excited. It doesnt mean that its invalid, but is it just a mainstream way of thinking? Ii hope not. At this point i'm leaning towards not coming back to GW next year...for a couple of reasons. First, I think i made a mistake coming to such a prestigious school, because now that I dont know abut law schol, i would like to concentrate more on writing and not focus on getting straight A's. It bothers me going to a school thats 50,000  a year, because I dont feel like I'm getting a 50,000 education nor do i feel like thats what i want or need. I'm still not decided obviously, and I'd be lying if I said that being close to my family and having Joe near me isnt an influence, but thats also an important part of my life...Thats a wrap"

"event","So I'm sitting in my Math & Politics class today. The Professor is a nice guy...awkward? Yes. Does he write notes on the board that are completely wrong? Yes. However, he's a nice guy. He's writing notes on the board today and every single prep-school attending, DMB listening jerk in the room finds it necessary to comment and make fun of him, and my dislike for these people (which seem to be the entire population of the school) has just been growing. Then this kid behind me who i happen to know a little says ""I bet he's awkward in bed..."" Who says that? I was just angry and I turned around and said ""This coming from possible the most awkward kid i've ever met..."" We were in class so the conversation didnt go much farther, but I'm just SO tired. No, Todd, not now! 

Let me just go into detail about how excited i am to go home. I've learned to live here, I've learned to deal with it and I've found my little group of friends. But I'm not happy here, I need to go home. Lookin forward to Marla and her clubfoot, lookin forward to Southern cooking, Southern Comfort, Southern Hospitality, because DC although its below the Mason-Dixon line, is as Northern a school as NYU. My mind is in all different places right now. Girls confuse me, and i'm definitely paranoid about all of my relationships at this point, relationships with these aforementioned girls, family, everyone. Oh well. I'm going to take a nap...awkwardly...?"

"event","My first entry. This past week/weekend has been one of enlightenment,and frustration. And the two are totally in cahoots with each other - i've decided that with enlightenment comes responsibility and therefore frustration. I want to write, I want to be immersed in hip-hop culture, so I want to write about being immersed in hip-hop culture. So i sit down and I write...and I fucking hate what I write. I dont like writing poorly, because it makes me feel that what I'm feeling is poor and inadequate, becaue I write what I feel and how I feel. everyone tells me that i just need to wait this whole thing out - being at school that is (a topic change, I know, but I digress...deal with it). But the thing is, few things are for sure...certain. Joseph, Jenny, Michael and a host of animals are certain. Adam West is certain. Atlanta is certain. My life up here is not certain, GW isnt, DC isnt, nothing is. I feel like now that I've found what I want to do in life, how i want to make a difference, I need what has always inspired me, what has always nurtured my creativity - my family, and my city. This has been the first time that writing has been adequate in venting. I've been trying to think of a topic for an article...i want to submit something to The Ave, my new favoritest magazine. But I sit and I write. But my topics are bland, boring. Grr...I need to chill, but I'm uncomfortable up here, so I havent been able to chill adequately since i got here. As the subject suggests, Fuck. For now, feast your eyes on what makes me comfortable."

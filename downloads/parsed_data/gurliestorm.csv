"event","i can't sleep anymore. i don't know what happened.. it started about 2 weeks ago when it became hard to sleep. it is now IMPOSSIBLE to sleep. it makes no difference how much activity i do during the day either. i went for a long ass bike ride on saturday, and on saturday night i was so tired i was dead on my feet. as soon as i got into bed, my eyes popped open and i just <i>could not sleep</i>.

last night it was hot and i still couldn't get to sleep, despite being incredibly tired. i think i got to sleep at a bout 6:30 am probably from exhaustion, but then i woke up at 9:30 am wide awake. two hours later my eyes were stinging because they needed to rest so badly. i ended up sleeping until 1 in the afternoon.

so i've had about 5 hours sleep in the past 24 hours and i don't actually feel so bad. technically i should be able to fall asleep easily tonight, but i doubt that's going to happen.

has this happened to anyone else? what did you do?"

"event","that was, up until yesterday. not only did the liberals (who, as <lj-user>cyaniderose</lj-user> put it, aren't very liberal at all, in case you were confused) win with a landslide victory over labor, labor actually lost seats, and the 'family first party' aka. entirely scary religious freaks, have the balance of power in the senate which is really fucking scary. aside from *cough* my parents *cough* i don't know of anyone who voted for the liberals. i guess i'd have to move to the bush to find people who voted for the liberals though, since my electorate (denison) pretty much always votes labor.

so, not only do we have john howard as prime minister for a few more years, it will eventually be the smarmiest, smuggest git in the government at the moment, peter costello who will take over from john howard when he retires.... which will be sometimes in the next four years.

"event","last sunday jolse told steven we thought he should probably leave and now he's packing up all his stuff as we speak. i don't know how much longer he'll be here. he's been such a prick to me but i feel really mean. i thought i'd be excited to see the back of him but i just feel guilty.

the other day we had one last fight because he told jolse that i told his girlfriend in queensland that he wasn't home when she rang, even though he was home. apparantly she said she could tell i was lying about him not being home and he told her not to call us anymore because i always lie and say he's out when he's not. i asked her if she said that because steven most definitely wasn't home at the time, and she said she didn't say it at all and he brought up that i lie <i>all the time</i> about him not being home. i always always always pass on her messages or give him the phone if he is here. so i asked him why he lies about me all the time and he just started saying ""i told her she can't ring up anymore because of you!"". i told him to grow up and stop lying because it was only me and him there and we both know the truth and he didn't say anything. then he picked up the phone and goes ""well thanks a lot she's fucking gone now"" and slammed it back down. i went to our other phone and she was still there, heard the entire argument and wondered why the hell he picked up the phone, she said hello, and then slammed it back down again. he's such a child.

but i feel bad for him.

i should make a list of all the shitty things he's done to remind me not to feel so guilty."

it was like ending a relationship with an alcoholic or something. he was begging me to stay, saying 'i'll change', 'we need you'. all the while i was like no, no, no. after he said he'd change he made some comment that i always bend over the heater with my arse in the air.. couldn't go for 5 minutes without insulting me!!

i 'spose i'll find a new job that i like, but not just yet.. i need time to relish in my unemployment hehehe.

i can't believe i actually did it. it felt so good to tell him what i thought and to have him sitting there stunned that this sweet little girl had such venom in her. raah!!"

"event","an old boyfriend from when i was like 14/15 came into work today and he recognised me. i was suddenly bombarded with embarrassing memories or wearing baggy surf brand tshirts and drinking beer at his house and being picked up by my mum at 11pm!!!! so i did an eternal sunshine of the spotless mind on him and acted like i didn't remember him! this would have worked, if i hadn't gone to get his photos without him telling me his name!! DUH!!!! 

i think i covered my arse though. i said ""i just remembered who you are! we met on the bus!"" i said that he looked heaps different, but he said i look the same. it's comforting to know that i look like a 14 yr old still- hey i get it all the time."

"event","i must be tired or something because it just took me about half an hour to find the 'update journal' page. i totally forgot i bookmarked it months ago and have been using that bookmark regularly.. duhhhh

last night i left my computer on, and sometime during the night our adsl cut out and i'd had the speakers on this computer up really loud. it kept trying to check my email but it couldn't cos there was no internet, so every 10 minutes it played that windows xp error sound, EXTREMELY LOUDLY! hahah. i heard it in my sleep cos i kept dreaming that i was trying to use the computer but it wouldn't do anything i wanted it to!! what a nerd

we went to see shrek 2 last night, which was really funny. the line for it was the biggest line i have ever seen at the movies. given that i live in a city with only 100,000 people, it was quite odd. the line went out of the foyer and into the carpark. 

before the movie they showed previews of that new animated movie, shark tale. someone please tell me that the characters in that movie are meant to bare a small resemblance to the person doing the voice? cuz the robert de niro shark actually looks like him and the angelina jolie fishy does too. jolse thinks i am mad.

oh yeah here is the obligatory, 'buy my freakin' ebay stuff' picture too. man i have been so uninspired lately! :(

"event","FUCK! i was in my room looking for change for the bus before i go to work and i wasn't being quiet, i might add. then i opened the door to the room which made a banging sound because of the way the doorknob is. then the stupid guy who lives with us emerges from his room NAKED and just stands there. i was like ""what the FUCK!!!!"" and he goes ""oh i thought you had left"" when he knows i don't leave until 10:45 because he mentioned it one day. i didn't want to even look at him so i just went back into my room and refrained from vomiting all over the floor. it was obvious i was on my way to the bathroom, so what does he do; he goes in there, locks the door and has a shower. now i'm going to  miss the bus and be late cos i have to wait until he leaves so i can brush my hair and my teeth.

argh!!!!!!E#@$#$#$##$#

okay so the male body isn't THAT disgusting, but if you knew this guy you'd know why i am reeling in horror. that and the fact that he was drunk on the weekend and asked if i'd do him while jolse isn't around. eh???!

somebody hold me"

"event","i think i am almost braindead from a day at working doing absolutely shit all. no that's not fair, i did print 3 films, but but printing films gets tedious. i need something that i need to THINK about. i was so bored i felt like crying. on top of that i copped abuse from customers that wanted films as soon as i walked in, because frank (my boss) was too lazy to do them while i wasn't there. 

i'm meant to work friday so they can stay home and cook a meal because they have people coming over for dinner *yawn*. i'm going to get jolse to ring up say i'm sick because i've had it with them this week. i don't need their lousy $51"

"event","for reasons i've mentioned before, i've started using my old ebay account to buy stuff that i want to reconstruct. it has 2 feedbacks on it and i've noticed people aren't very nice to me!!! whenever i've bought something as gurliestorm, the sellers are always friendly.

one girl tried to tell me it's customary for a seller to only leave feedback after the buyer has. i know people choose to do that but it isn't customary.. pfft, and she told me if i didn't pay today she would neg me. ahahha"

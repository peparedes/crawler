"event","I'VE GRADU-MA-CATED!!!! The ceremony was yesterday morning. It was okay, it didn't last too long. I sat next to Jared, which was great because I didn't know what was going on at all. We were both just following everyone else. I'm glad I made it through without tripping (I was wearing the worst shoes, they were so steep) but the sleeve of my gown got slightly caught on the railing of the stairs leading from the stage. Oh well, I don't think anyone noticed. :) So what's there to do now that I'm an adult?"

"event","Hello all,

I don't know how many of you out there are familiar with the old fashioned ""exquisite corpse"" drawings? It's when someone starts to draw something and then other people jump in and continue the drawing. Well today I'm going to do one better...me and Sarah are going to take turns and write an ""exquisite corpse"" story. How fun.

(H) One day Mr. Logan-Price was in a hurry to get to a very important meeting.  The meeting was about (S) ten minutes away, and the traffic on 1st AVE was excessively heavy.  He decided to (H) put his pedal to the metal and see how fast his car could go even though he was in heavy traffic.  He didn't get too far, and in fact ran over a little Geo, ricocheted into a cement barricade, and then (S) came to a screeching stop right next to a grumpy cop.  His Hummer does have  8 cylinders, so he thought he could out run the cop.  He took off again, this time going through the ditch (to avoid the traffic you know).  The next thing he knew, there were cop cars surrounding him.  They ran him off the road, and he could hear a cop with a megaphone yelling (H) ""I know by driving a Hummer you must have the 'tiny dick' syndrome, but it's ridiculous to think that your gas-guzzling tank can out-last our swift little sedans."" And just like in Jurassic Park where the T-Rex ran out of steam, the Hummer did too. At that point, Mr. Logan-Price decided to (S) cry.  He couldn't take it any more.  He fell on the ground, tiny dick and all, sobbing, begging not to be taken to jail.  The cops had seen this before however, and could not forgive him that easily.  Besides, driving a supper SUV meant he not only supported terrorism, but was a key financial figure, according to our president.  So, with the Patriot Act in full effect, they strip-searched him right there, on the side of the road, set his SUV ablaze, and threw him in the slammer. (H) While in prison, Mr. Logan-Price enjoyed rubbing his hands on the rusty metal bars saying ""ah, that was good for the fingers!"" However, he was starving. By thinking there might be donuts at the meeting he was supposed to be at, he forgot to eat his usual breakfast--a big plain gummy bowl of oatmeal.  So he searched his cell for something and found (S) a used condom, an unused rope, and some old cheese.  He tried to eat the cheese, but then he discovered it was so old that the used condom tasted better.  Besides, the mice had eaten off of it.  So, there Mr. Logan-Price sat.  Now 3 hours late for his meeting, every orifice still oozing of Vaseline, his SUV a burnt chuck of metal, his house being 'throughly investigated for terroristic evidence', and his only meal a used condom.  Right now, life is not so sunny for him.  What on earth could he do to make the clouds go away on this dark, bleak, stormy day?

We will continue the saga...so keep up-to-date with this entry!"

"event","On my way to my last class today I saw a guy running. It got me to thinking that I need to start running. Believe it or not, I'm really out of shape...like I could probably make it for two blocks or so and that's it. So, to make the most of my lacking endurance I was thinking I'd run really slow, but yet have some guy running ahead of me with a huge fan. The illusion would be that I'm running much faster than I actually am. He'd need a really long extension cord, but that's beside the point. Genius, thy name is Hollan. And it was good. *pause for visual image* Thinking about this earlier today made me burst out laughing, in public, while walking alone to class. I probably looked crazy.

So. Another four years, eh? Here's what I plan to do for the next four years:

I'm going to invest in a log cabin in the wilds of Canada and I will set up a small, but affordable, pharmaceutical clinic. Cheap cheap prescription drug costs galore! I will also wear a lot of flannel.

"event","I went home this past weekend. My dad came into town on Thursday afternoon to pick me up, and since our future VP, John Edwards, was speaking in Hubbard Park we decided to go see him talk. It was cool, all complete with a whopping crowd of Bush supporters on the Pentacrest...and by ""whopping"" I mean all 8 of them. There was one political speaker who went before Edwards, and you could tell he was from the South. He ended his speech shouting at the top of his lungs ""BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK, AND YOUR KIDS ARE ON THE TRACK WITH YOUR GRANDKIDS ON THE TRAIN, AND WE'RE GONNA GRAB THE CONDUCTOR AND HOGTIE HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE TRRAAAIIINNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" People were just kind of looking around at each other, clapping, but thinking ""whatthehell?"" 
On Friday I spent some time at the art library researching for an abstract I have to write up and then that night I worked on a big paper for my persuasion class. On Saturday during the day I went to Mt. Vernon to visit my brother's new place with my grandparents.  Later that night I continued to work on my big paper for my persuasion class. On Sunday I came back to my place in Iowa City to further work on my paper, but to my dismay MY FUCKING DISK WAS DAMAGED AND I COULD NOT RECOVER MY SHITTY FILE OF A PAPER!!!! Yeah. So my weekend evenings pretty much went right down the shitter in vain. I had to type up my whole paper that I lost while in the dungeons of Burge's ITC last night. Now I'm behind in everything and I'm still not close to being done with my paper. Well, on the bright side, I think I'm building character."

"event","Yup, my weekend was full of the arts, leisure, social activity, and oh yeah...hot police action. Woo-hoo!

On Friday I went with Melissa, Aaron, Greta, Tim, and Dylan to the Rufus Wainwright concert at the IMU. It was sooooo awesome! I love Rufus and his gingham cowboy shirt and tight leather pants! He played all of my favorite songs, including California, Hallelujah, and a muddled version of Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk. After the show we all went to Joe's Place for a bit. Later on, me and Julie did our usual skipping around the bars and we also hung out with our friend, Tiger.  He promised us Applebee's and a Trivial Pursuit championship for the following day WHICH he never delivered on! I want deliverance! I want my comeupance! Well, anyways...

Saturday was the LMC bar crawl. I knew most of the people on the bar crawl this year, so yay for me i guess! It was a fun time, but I hope I don't get any weird gentlemen callers since Angie pretty much billboarded my phone number on the back of my shirt.  She thinks she is so funny. Okay, well the bar crawl was a blast...I was drunk...and then everything got interesting when the bars closed. A big group of us had to pee so we headed over to Phillips Hall.  Scott and Sarah had keys to get into the building (they work there for those not familiar).  So about 10 of us were inside and then police came banging on the front doors, telling us to open up.  The whole building was surrounded as a few of us were trying to leave through the other exit. Now at this point I was worried about Julie because she absolutely can't get in trouble with the police. The same goes for Doug as well.  So the police rounded us up and took down our information.  They threatened to write up a report for possible breaking and entering and public intox.  They even took poor Sarah aside because I think they thought she opened the doors when it was Scott.  Okay, well, the good thing was that Scott's roommate Austin (who was on the bar crawl, but didn't go inside Phillips) came up to the police and told them about 1 guy who was getting beat up by 4 other guys near Old Capitol Mall. The cops took off and told us to leave the building.  The bad thing, though, was that one of the cops still had me, scott, and erin's licenses.  Everyone else got there's back.  So we all split up. Me, Erin, and Scott went down the street to look for the cops but they were no where in sight. On the way, we practically ran into this older drunk guy who was yelling ""this is what St. Patrick's day is all about!!!"" I normally would've laughed my ass off, but I was way too pissed off.  Eventually we found the cops and got our licenses back, thank you Jesus, BOO-YAH! Then the three of us walked back and met up with Juile and Austin and we hung out at my place for a bit. I think we're pretty much in the clear because they didn't breathalize us or anything, so they would have no proof. I just think the whole incident is pretty funny and makes for a great story. I just hope Sarah and Scott don't get into too much trouble with their bosses! I love you guys!!! Well, I guess until next weekend..."

Like when you cross the street, turn in a test, buy a gallon of milk, see a squirrel, get in a car accident (not a serious one, otherwise you'd be an asshole), or whenever a pastor says the word ""Jesus"" it should be followed up with a festive ""BOO-YAH!"".

"event","Well, I'm in the library right now with Sarah. We're just killing some time before our next class, so we're both updating our LJ's at the same time. We both had to pee really bad before we got here, and it was a lot of fun because it was crowded in there and I was also on the phone to Julie (hi Julie!). 

So here's a little about my day today:

My first class of the day made me a little mad. We were talking about documentaries, and Farenheit 9/11 was part of the discussion. I believe most of the people in my class are Republican(also Greek, because we were discussing a sororiety/fraternity doc the day before). People kept saying how distorted the facts were, how Michael Moore just outlandishly attacks Bush, and someone brought up that if he wanted to hear half-truths he'd just listen to Kerry's speeches (most of the people in the class didn't even see the movie--for the record). I just rolled my eyes the whole time. Oh yeah, it's not like Fox News doesn't distort the truth and make attacks on Kerry and call it news. Hell no! That's unethical. At least Moore has the decency to say his documentary is an op-ed piece. And documentaries, no matter what the hell they are about, are always skewed. None of them are objective because the filmmaker, the film, and the viewer all have perceived notions about what the subject is about. There. I said it. 

I also ate a taco today, which made me pretty happy. And now Sarah's looking at a site about Irish Wolfhounds, and that's making me pretty happy too. And Jake has a phone!!!!! :) For a good time, call ##-###-####, oh baby!

Toodles."

"event","I think I'm going to invest in a loudspeaker and take it everywhere I go so I can shout at all the stupid people in this town. I have a story: I went to Brugger's this afternoon after I took a quiz in my Human Origins class. I was so excited to eat because I didn't have a big lunch earlier, and when I got there I waited like 7 minutes or so for this fat stupid employee to get done explaining all the good things to eat to her patron/friend. When it finally was my turn, the employee gave me some attitude and asked me what I wanted. What made me mad the most was when she pretty much slapped my change (from a $20...this is important to remember!)into my hand as fast as possible. I was appalled. I just stood there for a few seconds and then I sat down, glaring at her while I ate. Now if I had a loudspeaker I would've yelled at her: ""WOULD IT FUCKING HURT YOU TO BE PLEASANT, ESPECIALLY TO PAYING CUSTOMERS? AND WOULD IT ALSO HURT YOU TO KEEP YOUR FAT FINGERS AND FAT HEAD AWAY FROM THE MERCHANDISE?!?! YOU ALREADY LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR JOB A LITTLE TOO MUCH!"" Okay, well, after Brugger's I was hungry for some chocolate (it always calms me down), so I went to Cookies & More. As soon as I got there I noticed that I only had $10 in my wallet. Let's do the math: I started out with $20; at Brugger's I bought a cream cheese bagel, a small pop, and a bag of chips; I end up with $10. THAT'S A FUCKING $10 GOURMET MEAL, APPARENTLY!!!! The incompetent, surly, bloated, homely skank of an employee ripped me off with my change! I should really call up the management and advise them in the future to hire people who can count correctly, especially when a fucking register tells them exactly what change is needed! I was thinking about turning around, going straight to Brugger's and yell at the bitch, but I had no proof of purchase (she gave me no receipt in her haste of practically throwing my meager change at me) so it was pointless. I'm just boycotting now, which is a shame, because I like the place. Maybe with my potential loudspeaker I'll just stand outside the door and sound the alarm every 5 minutes. Ooh...I'll get a strobe light too and start breakdancing, yes!"

"event","1.) I got called ""a fucking bitch"" by some hooker when I accidently cut in front of her friend at a port-o-johnny at the tailgate. Julie said if she was there she would've punched the hooker for me. And I would've had Julie's back. 
2.) I found out that Julie has a friend named Hans.
3.)Melissa stole a cookie from somewhere, had about a beer, and said that she was trashed.
4.) I did my first beer bong. Julie did too.
5.) Julie yelled at the supporters of Chuck Grassley, calling them ""fuckers"" right in front of them, but only because they had a life-sized cut-out of George W. Bush.
6.) I stuck some potato chips in Simon's muffler, and proceeded to point and laugh.
7.) At the football game a guy had an Amana Colonies T-shirt from the Woolen Mill (one that I have)! I was like ""dude, I'm from there!"" and he said that he wanted to be neutral at the game.
8.) Julie almost got beamed in the head three times by some falling wallnuts when we laid under a tree (we always seem to end up under a tree somewhere)."

"event","It's been awhile since I've done my laundry, so this morning I decided to do it. With one basket load, I walked down to the basement washers--which, by the way, had their doors closed. Not thinking, I put in several quarters to start filling up the machine with water. Not even a minute into it, a girl walks down and I say ""hi"". She just gives me the ""omigod!"" look and asks me if I took the laundry out of the washer before I started it. I was stunned. I didn't even think to look inside before I started, and sure enough, when I lifted the lid, there were her soaking clothes. She kept mumbling stuff like ""do you mind if we re-spin it?"" and I was like ""sure, anything, whatever you need to do!"". I offered to rewash her clothes with my stuff and then I'd dry it, but I don't think she was listening to me. She just took her dripping clothes and tossed them into a basket. And here's what made me feel like a completely awful person--she started to cry! I was like, WHOA! OKAY OKAY I made a mistake, I'm sorry, but didn't you just WASH these clothes in a WASHER that fills up with WATER which I mistakenly did again??? I didn't put soap in, and there wasn't that much water in there in the first place because she stopped me right when I started. So I feel terrible this morning, even though I don't think it's a big deal. I left a note down on her dryer, so I'm hoping she doesn't hate me for the rest of the semester while I'm here in this God-forsaken house. People are such freaks sometimes (and that includes me too, I guess). Well, maybe she'll understand how sorry I am if I just throw myself into the dryer until I die. That should get the point across very nicely."

And even though everyone's back in the office (disregard what I posted yesterday) and some ""anonymous"" people don't really seem to care it's my last day (at least that's what i think...time for me to go, i guess), today is going by okay. I ate some cookies that were left out in the break room and....uh...yeah, that's the highlight of my morning so far. If anything else happens, I'll keep y'all posted! Super."

"event","Today has been a really good day. It's the day before my last day here at Protek. I've been back in production doing inserts, keeping busy for most of the day! I love the production workers!!! They're awesome and soooo fun!!! While back there I talked to two people, one of which is the CEO's son, about what it would be like tomorrow at work. Not only will it be Friday the 13th AND my last day, but most of the office people are going to be gone. Only the two engineers, me, and possibly our accountant will be in the office. So back in production today we were joking that we should bring a keg in and have a big party here tomorrow. Either that, or just don't show up and confuse the head people who check in with the production workers. I jumped in and said that i wanted to dress up in a Godzilla costume and terrorize the warehouse (c'mon, it'd be fun!). So as I left the production area to come man the phones (our administrative assist. left), I noticed a card and a bag full of candy (my favorite!)! Everybody signed the card, wishing me good luck, and I ran around and handed the candy out to everyone, otherwise I'd OD on it. So yeah, it's been fun...I just wonder what tomorrow is going to be like now! Woo-hoo! Godzilla, here I come! (Just kidding...maybe...)"

"event","Okay, well, a certain anonymous someone has asked me to make more updates that are longer as well. But I believe that everyone who reads my journal knows that I don't ever really do anything, especially during the weekdays, except that I surf the internet at work. Primarily for news...such as abcnews.com and cnn.com. Once in awhile I'll go to foxnews.com just for a laugh. I also check my email and/or this LJ every 10 minutes. But that's my weekdays, and I'm very aware of the fact that I'm a big ball of ""lame"". On the weekends, however, my ""lame"" becomes ""emal"" which is backwards for ""lame""...not meaning lame at all! With me? 
So, getting to my weekend: as I was getting ready for a big night out Saturday night I happened to watch that friendly white-trash show ""Cops"". It was pretty interesting because in one segment it showed a cop prowling the mean streets of Des Moines, talking about eating a turkey sandwich. See, the guy prepares several tiny meals a day so he can take them on the road with him, busting dope fiends with a mouthfull of lunch meat. He's also trying to eat healthier because sitting in a cop car is hard on the back and shoulders. All of this excitement is established in the first 2 minutes of the segment...but then, if that's not enough action for you, MORE action hits! A rowdy kid on a dirt bike tries to evade this ""po po"". As the cop follows the bike onto a railroad track, the car gets stuck--all the while trains are coming his way! And then hilarity ensues!!! More cops show up to laugh their asses off at the dopey cop while he gets a stern call from the captain, the end. God bless the law enforcement in Polk County, eh? Great job, guys, and way to make an impression on a cable TV show! 
But anyways, I'm not going to get into my weekend, because I think it will be overshadowed by my ""Cops"" story. Sorry!"

And then again when i walked from my car to Office Depot. And yet again when i walked from Office Depot to my car. And finally I enjoyed the sunshine by walking from my car to Protek. So as you can tell, I went to Office Depot today to run some errands--which meant I HAD STUFF TO DO!!! WOW! I also answered the telephone once today and took a message. Yeah...I'm pretty cool."

I think Hostess uses Yankee candles in their bakery goods to make up for their expenses of employing highly skilled, highly paid workers at their facilities.

Has anyone seen ""Ground Hog's Day"" with Bill Murray in it, where he lives the day over and over? Well, my day is like that today. I'm working production, and I have only been given one job to do back there--insertion (sounds kind of perverted...if only it was!!! Boy oh boy!!!). Now, normally I like to do production. I have little blue protective booties to wear that get me all excited. But when it involves the same task to do over and over again, while STANDING for the love of Jesus R. Thompson, AND with my head down the whole time, I get a little achey. The result is i end up complaining on my journal. At least Max gets a little angst in this entry. Another bummer is that it's Monday. On a good note, I saw a groundhog today!!!"

(C) I'm hoping Neil Patrick Harris reads this and invites me to his exclusive country club for a round of golf and some conoodling. ""Doogie Hauser"" will live in my heart forever!!! Why was that show ever cancelled?

last week i went to this amazing retreat called SAW (signed & anointed to witness) and it was sooooo great. we had so much fun and we totally bonded and Gods love was present in every single person there. everything was perfect (minus the food) hahaha. o yes and i met this awesomly awesome guy named austin and hes just super cool. so yeah im excited about all that cuz i love God :-)!
after i left the retreat i went straight up to Hollister Ranch for a camping trip with cuyler, chrystine, steve, jorden, matt, chase, kenzi, annie, dimitri & spiker. it was soooo much fun (maybe even a little too much?) yeah so that was an awesome weekend. 
so then i get home and monday i read the grapes of wrath for 6 hours... partaaay then tuesday i worked and then turned it in and then it all fell apart like it usually tends to do on wednesday night. parents and i got in a huge fight over nothing beacuse we dont know how to pick our battles and it was really bad and i felt really bad for elliot cuz she was there. i didnt really get a punishment i just got screamed at and lectured which can be worse if u know my parents....

alright well i have to go to work
peace xoxoxo"

"event","This place is a prison

and these people aren't your friends

Inhaling thrills through twenty dollar bills

and the tumblers are drained and then flooded

again and again. 


There's guards at the onramps

Armed to the teeth

And you may case the grounds

from the cascades to Puget Sound

but you are not permitted to leave. 


I know there's a big world out there

like the one that I saw on the screen

in my living room late last night

it was almost too bright to see.
 

and I know that it's not a party

if it happens every night

pretending there's glamour and candelabrum

when you're drinking by candelight.
 

And what does it take

to get a drink in this place?

what does it take?

how long must I wait?

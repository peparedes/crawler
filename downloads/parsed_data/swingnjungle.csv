You how some memes/surveys are actually fun? I'm bringing it back. Songs that have been correctly identified will have an asterisk by them. In the immortal words of Wolfenstein 3-D, GET PSYCHED!

Step 1: Get your playlist together, put it on random, and play.
Step 2: Write down the first line from the first 20 songs that play or close to it.
Step 3: Post and let everyone you know guess what song the lines come from.
Step 4: Cross out the songs when someone guesses correctly

1. ""Going down the highway, like a rocket.""
2. ""Please just don't play with me""
3. ""Allie woke up 8am, graduation day""
4. ""A better slumber was in your arms""
5. ""Das Leben is grausam und schrechlich gemein."" 
6. ""Brothers and sisters put this record down""
7. ""Its after midnight and she's on your phone""

"event","I have just come up with CNU's new slogan:  CNU, the place technology comes to die.  Catchy isn't it??  I think so.  I have just realized that at one time or another I have been without every comfort of modern conveniance for longer than 24 hours.  I lost hot water in my apartment for 5 days,  I lost electricity in my room for 3 days, the internet is constantly out, and most recently I have been without air conditioning.  Today there was a heat warning for Newport News and all I could do was laugh.  My A/C pumps out hot air even when we turn it off keeping it somewhere between 85 and 95 at all times.  It is impossible to sleep in.  I am not without friends though.  Many friends have offered to put me up while I am getting through this and I have taken some up on it.  Without them I don't know how I would have gotten through this past 2 1/2 weeks."

"event","So I have been super busy so far this summer.  I started working at City Hall on monday and have been there from 8-5 every day since.  Usually I have been going out after work or chilling with my sisters.  Monday was Lindsey's 21st so we went out and got her properly trashed.  Alot of DARE camp people were there so we got us a table at Bob's and caught up.  It was me Bess Will Carley Lindsey(when she came over) and Early.  We had a good time and I was out LATE.  It made for a fun time at work the next morning.  Last night I participated in my first Thirsty Thursday ever and it was wierd b/c i saw so many people from high school (mostly those i didn't like) due to the fact that we have all recently entered the 21 club and are ready to take advantages of the membership.  Work has been good.  Kinda boring sometimes b/c i am mostly doing stuff with filing.  Its been nice spending time with my sisters.  Taylor and i went to Barnes and Noble the other day due to it is like our heaven.  We all watched a movie together after baseball and we had a good time.  Speaking of movies I saw Davinci code on fri.  It was pretty good but i was irritated that they changed the end b/c it didn't make alot of sence in the movie.  Whatever at least they didn't completely ruin it for me.  Sultan comes in this weekend so I can't wait to spend some time with her on my 3 DAY WEEKEND!!!

Till next time"

"event","So last nights concert was awesome.  It was crowded as hell though.  The first band was pretty good but the second band scared me.  They were all screaming and had paint dripping down thier body and they were creepy.  The third band I have to admit i really didn't pay much attention to b/c at that point i was just trying to remain upright there was so much pushing.  I did fall over once but i wasn't trampled or anything.  After them Steph found a way to the front of the crowd and we were just 3 people back.  it was cool.  Then All American Rejects came on.  OMG is thier lead singer sexy.  He even did the bedroom eyes thing during Dirty little secret.  At this point we were being pushed like crazy.  At one point i was so compacted i might have been able to fit into a pair of size 8s.  During the set change we made friends with some of the people around us.  Then Fall Out Boy came on and they were awesome.  I took so many pictures with my camera.  We were jumping and dancing like mad.  About half way through thier set though the lack of water and tight spaces caught up with us and we had to get out of the crowd.  As we were making our way out this bitchy girl decided she wanted to try and start a fight.  She yelled at me for trying to get out and when the crowd pushed me on to her she started yelling more and looked like she was gonna hit me.  so steph hit her for me.  The girl was in such shock that she didn't do anything and we got out of there.  We went and got water and compared bruises.  We were all soaked through, the gross part was that half of it wasn't our own sweat.  We decided we'd had enough of the pushing so we stayed at the top and watched from there.  All I can say is damn dehydration.  B/c of it we moved and got jiped.  Pete jumped right to where we were standing before and then they threw shirts out to where we had been, then pete jumped again, and then he threw his sweatshirt out to right where we had been.  next time i go to a concert i am gonna take some serious water with me so that I don't have to leave and miss out again.  But i did have a great time anyway.  I DANCE, DANCED WITH FALL OUT BOY!!"

"event","So...
Well I can honestly say that this has been the worst week I have ever had in my life.  But if this is as bad as it ever gets i think i can deal.  To start off this ""seemingly"" chain reaction Grampa Willett passed.  I guess it wasn't as bad as it was sad b/c i understand that it is better for him but it's just hard for those he left behind.  Most of the Willetts seemed to be handling it well and you could just tell that Grampa Willett was at the house after the lake because we were all able to laugh and and tell stories and not dwell on the sadness.
On the way back to Newport News from the funeral Cara and I got into a car accident.  We were both ok physically but the car was totaled and the jerk who caused the accident didn't stop.  We spent the rest of the day getting checked out at the hospital and crashing in on her brothers so that they could drive us back to school.  I thought I was doing pretty well mentally but sunday after bid day (the only shining light in this whole week although I was very miffed that I didn't get to be an angel) I had a breakdown.  It hit me what could of happened and I couldn't stop bawling for over an hour.  Kristen called in the middle of this and convinced me to call my mom and ask her to come down as well as to call someone nearby to help calm me down.  I called my mom and she said she would be there asap and then i called sultan who helped alot.  We went and got slurpees and hung out at Megan and Yasmeens who made me laugh so hard that i forgot all about the accident.
My mom came down and that helped alot too.  She stayed a night and then needed to get back.  After that everything seemed to be going well again until Friday when I woke up and my tonsils were the size of golf balls.  Tonsilitis again, woo hoo.  I guess i should be grateful b/c it could have been mono which would have been alot worse.
And today Grey's Anatomy decided to blow up a character that I really liked.  I wanted him to stick around.  Well hopefully the week will end and life will be back to normal.  Thanks to everyone reading who has helped me with my sanity during the last week!  I love you guys."

"event","So another year has begun already.  I guess it technically began two weeks ago but as school is starting up I finally feel like its a new year.  This is going to be a big year for me.  It will be my last year as a DARE camp counselor, I will begin my senior year in college this fall, and oh yeah my 21st birthday is this year!  It feels so weird to be so old, where did the time go??  This semester I am starting some of my teacher's prep classes so its finally hitting me that I am nearing the end of the 20 year education that has been my life up until now (including preschool for those of you fuzzy on the math).  I guess it is appropriate that I am going to be a teacher because school is really all I have known for the past 17 years (like i remember the first 3).  
Well on to the New Year's resolution.  This year I am going to be more organized, or at least try.  (and for those of you who are going to criticize organized does not mean clean, it just means that I know where everything is in the mess)  I have bought one of those binders with lots of pockets and I'm making a pocket for each aspect of my life and fileing the papers there.  I am going to try and get my desk under control and organize my bathroom.  I think that is enough of a resolution to keep me busy all year.
Classes started yesterday and I forgot how good it feels to be at school even if I hate the whole classes aspect, I really missed the people.  I also love having a busy schedule again and not having every night free.  Secretly I like meetings because they give me something to do and keep me in touch with people.  I'm back at work and there are a few differences, none bad, we have 2 new FDAs, 2 new RAs, our boxes have new labels on them, and justin has a goatee (and he only looks a little creepy with it j/k).
There is one thing I would really like to do this year but its kinda embaressing so I am not going to commit it to print and the chances of it happening are probably small cuz I am so freaking shy (those of you who know me well know what I am talking about)  I am going to work harder at it though so maybe this is the year.  Keep your fingers crossed for me!!"

"event","So, break was awesome.  I haven't laughed so much in a long time.  First there was thanksgiving, and when ever my crazy family gets together you know there are going to be some crazy times.  Like the story when my uncle accidentally poured floor wax in the pool and my aunt dove in and when she got out her body stuck together and she got out and yelled ""What the f*ck did you put in the pool?""  
Then my little sister had some people over on saturday night.  Hil and I hung out with Little Kegley like the whole night.  At one point we were watching Titanic and some one walks in and says ""is that titanic?"" and LK goes ""no, its titanic 2""  I almost died i was laughing so hard.
I didn't do any work over break and now i am paying for it.  I have 2 papers and a presentation all that have to be writen tonight but i will get it done.
Hope everyone else had a great break too!!"

"event","I just needed to comment on something that has been kinda pissing me off.  The other day during freshman move in one of the guys who was helping just made the random comment ""Guys are assholes"".  When I asked him why he said this he quoted the posters on the walls of the dorm stating that ""73% of guys would stop a sexual attack against a woman"" and ""82% of guys respect thier partners sexual wishes"".  He was pissed because the posters acted like that was something to be proud of and I have to agree.  So you are saying that 27% of males would let a girl get raped???  Thats a crap statistic.  you would think guys would have the balls to not let that happen.  That number should be alot higher if it is true (which i am hoping that it isn't).  To all those guys out there who have the balls...CHEERS!!!  To the others...You are an asshole."

Camp is freaking awesome.  I adore the kids we have been getting.  They are alot whineier than last year but its ok b/c they are so much fun.  The past two weeks have been my favorite.  The boys week was so cute, each of the girl counselors had a little following of 6th grade boys.  I myself had 4 boyfriends (more than i have had my whole life, sad i know).  I almost cried when that week ended.  But this past girls week was great too.  They were really into giving the counselors massages total i prob had about 5 or 6 hours of massages that week.  I hope the kids continue to be good.

The girl counselors are really bonding well this year.  Two weekends ago we had a movie night and watched Hide and Seek while pigging out on junk food and this weekend i convinced them to come to the midnight harry potter party with me.  It made the party so much fun to have people to joke with about all the other freaks there!! (and yes I have already finished the book it only took me 8 hours of reading to do it, such a good book, really sad but good and no i wont' tell you who dies.)

I miss everybody so much though don't think i have forgotten about yall.  I can't wait to get back to school and see yall.  I am so excited b/c kris gets back into town tomm I have missed her so much while she was gone. (yeah i know its only been 2 weeks i am such a dork)

Ok well thats about all thats new here but if there is more i will be sure to update.  Now let me leave you with a few funny quotes from camp (and yes they were all by the same person)

""I have a sister.  She is 6 but she will 13 next week""
""I said, what'd I say""
""You know I can't swim""
For clarifcation call me and i will tell you all about it.  Love yall"

I know yall have been anxiously waiting for a post from me and here it is!!  I finished my training week for DARE camp and it should def be and interesting year.  I am gonna be so buff b/c not only do i have a canoe trip once a week but our new high ropes course involved belaying people and I am apparently very good at it, which kinda makes me nervous to have children's lives in my hands like that.  I really miss having Will there though, he was so much fun to work with but i can understand how it might have been a bit awkward under the circumstances to have him still working there.  Monday we have our first week of kids and i am excited.

The drama in salem has yet ceased to amaze me...its impossible to escape.  But there has been one surprise concerning past drama...i know longer dislike colin!  I know, as weird as it may sounds we might actually be becoming friends.

I seriously miss all my CNU buddies.  Speaking of which, Aaron if you read this go to http://web.tickle.com/tests/goldengirl/?c=42555&test=goldengirlogt I think you will find it interesting...i am dorothy which i bet is no surprise.  I miss you!

I am craving a trip to Peru...i have no clue why but for some reason i just want to pack up and go there for a few weeks which i know is impossible but one day i am going to...anyone want to come with??

Thought i would let yall know how my life is going now ill be sure to keep up on the updates but for now...."

The ride there was not so fun b/c these totally lewd guys kept making rude and inappropriate gestures at us.  It didn't help that they were drinking.  The movie was so cool in 3D!!  Then we went to eat at Cheddars and we had the worst waitress ever.  We were honestly there for about 2 and 1/2 hours.  but then the night got really good.  I went to Anitas and had some FUN!  yeah yeah im in college and i live to do things im not supposed to so sue me.  Anyway it was great and i found out that i hate turkey!! haha for those of you who know what that means."

I knew about 75% of the multiple choice ?s and i think i rocked the essay but who knows this teacher hates me so it should be interesting.  The rest of the day was pretty relaxing i came back after the exam and took a 2 and 1/2 hour nap.  Then it was my favorite at lunch!!!  I love chicken parmesian.  kris and me went through my half of the room today and she fixed it!  then i went to Plaza with some of the A Phis and it was so good i can't believe i had never been before.  Then I went to my bible study's chritmas party.  We watched movies and ate cupcakes.  Then me and Jessi went shoe shopping well more like shoe stealing.  Fanny had some shoes that she didn't want anymore and she has big feet like us so we went to her house and chilled for about and hour and a half.  It was fun i got new shoes and some good conversation what more could a girl want??  Oh yeah she could want a boy.  Its mine and jessi's mission to get some.  I might need a little more help with it than her though.  One in particular would be great!!"

Lev 25:44 states that we may possess slaves as long as they are purchased from neighboring nations. (Planning a shopping trip to Canada as I type) 

Exodus 35:2 People who work on the Sabbath should be put to death.

Lev 11:10 Eating shellfish is an abomination.

Lev 21:20  One may not approach the altar of God if they have a defect in their sight.  

Lev 11:6-8 Touching the skin of a deaad pig makes you undlean.  Sorry.. all you manly Football players... You are a disappointment to our Lord! 

Lev 19:27 Getting the hair around your temples trimmed is forbidden!

Lev 19:19 You farmers aren't allowed to plant two different crops in the same field.

Lev 24:10-16  People who curse and blaspheme.... we are supposed to get the whole town together to stone you!

Lev 24:14 Those who sleep with their inlaws are to be burned to death at a private family affair.

So, according to these few - and it's only a few of them - everybody on this planet is either going to hell or should be put to death whether they cut their hair, play football, eat shellfish, etc etc.  Flipping bible thumping fools! Brain-dead as ever....

WACKY aint it?

We had to do a trail ride to train for DARE camp and my horse, Tank, must not have liked me.  He kept running me into trees.  The first tree scrached up my leg.  Then Tank gets an itch on his neck so he starts rubbing up against a tree slamming me into it while he does it.  It was horrible.  I also had lifeguard training today.  Luckely we didn't have the same guy who did it last year b/c according to Bess, Kara, and Will he was horrible.  I am tired from it but it isn't too bad.

Then as i was driving home i got behind this car who slowed down by 10 mph EVERY intersection whether they had a stop sign or were not turning it seemed like they were afraid of some maniac driver bursting out of one of the intersections and hitting them.  It was pretty funny."

It was the best school trip ever just because we had pretty much total freedom, i know yall are like ""but we had that in college too""  but omg freedom in NYC???  You can't even imagine what a good time i had.  I did something cultural every night and usually for pretty cheap.  Saw RENT and Phantom...both incredably fantastic, went to the ballet and also got to see a show at the Apollo!!!  Made a few new friends and a few new aquantances.  If you want a full account of my trip call me up and we will get together and i can bore you some more.  

I have been in for about a week now and the reason i haven't seen all of you yet is b/c i have been laying low.  Or i have been having alot of no fun...for example:  mon-wisdom teeth removed (don't worry they have me on the best pain killers known to man.) teus-physical for DARE camp job (they stuck me with a needle so that sucked too, but i got over it) wed-spent some time with the yayas cept julie couldn't come (but ill be there on fri girl).

We rode a few roller coasters:  Apollo's Chariot (which was more fun than any upside down one i have ever ridden, you feel like you are free falling), and Alpengeist.  We also rode alot of small rides but the real fun didn't involve rides.  At about 6 Ashleigh, Jeff, and Jon left.  The rest of us were gonna stay a bit longer and shop.  We had such a great time.  It was alot more laid back with a small group and i love melissa and ashleigh to death they are so much fun.  At one point ashleigh decided that she was gonna play out ditzy friend and she was good at it even though we all know she is real smart.  Me and melissa were rolling!!  Then later on we passed this couple on the bridge doing what couples do and melissa was like ""well lets just make out on the bridge.""  and they heard her it was so funny.

So by this time it was raining and i had to go find someone with jumper cables then push the car out of the spot so we could reach the engine.  It was crazy.

Easter was fun.  I went to the 9 service and then worked the 11.  During this i found out what i want to do.  I am gonna major in buisness and minor in childhood development and start my own day school or preschool.  Then mom and I went to see Ella Enchanted which was really adorable...sort of like Ever After but with more magic.  After the movie mom told me that dad was taking the girls to Short Pump to shop for an Easter treat.  So i call to see if i can come too and it turns out that they were coming to Newport News first to visit me!!  So the girls spent the night in my room while the rents got a hotel room.  The girls met Aaron and Katie.  They love Aaron he cracked them up.  And then we played a little prank on Aaron's roomie Paul.  We had Taylor take Aaron's key and go into his room and just start playing on his computer so Paul would wonder what was going on but apparently he didn't mind Taylor, we are thinking that is so b/c she was all like ""why are people being so lound college is for studying not partying"" and of course the loud people were me Aaron and hil laughing outside the room.  Then greg came along and we told him what was going on and he loved it.  Then the girls and i went to see Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny.

The next day the girls came to theater with me and took the quiz with fake names.  They both got a 90 on the quiz even though they had never read the material.  it was funny.  Then i faked sick and went to short pump with the family to go shopping.  On the way over we got stuck in a traffic jam for an hour it was horrible.  I got a few new shirts and i picked out Hilary's prom dress.  it is soooo her.  It was great to spend time with my family.

As i was writing this I just got great news...I GOT THE DARE CAMP JOB!!!!!!!!!   I am sooo exicited.  I was so nervous and i am so happy now!!!!!!!

Now to leave you with something that was on my friends profile that i think every college student will identify with.


In a few weeks... 

A year has past and now we stand on the brink of returning to a world where we are surrounded by the paradox of everything yet nothing being the same. In a few weeks we will reluctantly give our hugs and, fighting the tears, say goodbye to the people who were once just names on a sheet of paper to return to people that we hugged and fought tears to say goodbye to before we ever left. We will leave our best friends to return to our best friends. We will go back to places we came from and go back to the same things we did last summer and every summer before. We will come into town on that same familiar road, and even thought it has been months, it will seem like only yesterday.

As you walk into your old bedroom, every emotion will pass through you as you reflect on the way your life has changed and the person you have become. You suddenly realize that the things that were most important to you a year ago don't seem to matter so much anymore, and the things you hold highest now, no one at home will completely understand. Who will you call first? Where are you going to work? Who will be at the party Saturday night? What has everyone been up to? Who from school will you keep in touch with? How long before you actually start missing people bargaining in without calling or knocking? Who will get breadsticks with you at three in the morning? How long until you adjust to sleeping in a room by yourself, or how long before you realize your three best friends aren't in the bed next to your room?

Then you realize how much things have changed, you realize the hardest part of college is balancing the two completely different worlds you now live in, trying desperately to hold on to everything all the while trying to figure out what you have to leave behind. In the matter of one day's traveling time, we will leave our world of living next door to our best friends, walking across campus to eat, instant messenger, 8:00 classes, and perpetual procrastination to a world that will seem foreign to us despite the fact that we have lived in it for nineteen years.

But it is different now... We now know the meaning of true friendship. We know whom we have kept in touch with over the past year and whom we hold dearest to our hearts. We've left our high school worlds to deal with the real world. We have had our hearts broken, we've fell in love, we've helped our best friends through the toughest times of their lives, something their even best friends at home couldn't be there for. We've stayed up all night just to be there for a friend. We've partied the night away, doing stupid stuff, but we were always there for each other afterwards. There have been times when we've felt so helpless being hours away from home when we know our families or friends needed us most, and there are times when we know we have made a difference.

A few weeks from now we will leave. A few weeks from now we take down our pictures, and pack up our clothes. No more going next door to do nothing for hours on end. We will leave our friends whose random emails and phone calls will bring us to laughter and tears this summer. We will take our memories and dreams and put them away for now, saving them for our return to this world.

A few weeks from now from now we will arrive. A few weeks from now from now we will unpack our bags and have dinner with our families. We will drive over to our best friend's house and do nothing for hours on end. We will return to the same friends whose random emails and phone calls have brought us laughter and tears over the past year. We will unpack old memories and dreams that have been put away for the past year.

A few weeks from now we will dig deep inside to find the strength and conviction to adjust to change and still keep each other close. And somehow, in someway, we will find our place between these two worlds.

In a few weeks.... are you ready?"

"event","Today a girl in my english class was wearing a Stagg Bowl shirt.  I wanted to go up to her and be like ""so where'd you get that?"" but i figured i would be a TOTAL dork if i did so i didn't.  In other english news i think i finally wrote a good paper.  I might have gotten an A- if not then hopefully a B, i have been writing crappy papers recently but i think this one was better.

Lately I have been having really good dreams.  Dreams i don't want to wake up from because they are so good.  I don't remember most of them but i wake up feeling happy until i realize i am no longer in the dream.  I guess it is just a phase hopefully my life will catch up.

In English we are reading stories about writer's in New York reactions to 911.  It is really freaking me out though.  When i read the stories it takes me back to all my old feelings from that time period and what i went through and its not so happy.  But on the good side i am identifying really well with what is writen so i am making brillian observations that no one else in the class seems to get.

I am such a dork, i cant wait to go home this weekend b/c i am homesick."

"event","OK i even though she doesn't have a journal or know about mine i would like to take a moment and thank melissa for the past few weeks.  Without her i might have had to hurt someone.  These past weeks have been stressful and she was there to let me vent or to do something with me to take my mind off of it.  She is a great friend and is ranking up there with the yaya's about how much i appreciate her.  I am so glad to have found a friend like her here.

For those of you who knew i was sick this weekend i am feeling much better now.  Thanks to kris for taking care of me.  So those of you in Salem I will be in town for a short time this weekend.

"event","OMG Saturday was so much fun.  I went camping with Julie's bible study (or sitting around by a fire all day which it should have been called) and it was wonderful.  I needed a lazy day and everyone else had the same idea so we sat around and talked and told stories and sang and stuff it was wonderful.  I made loads of new friends (Steven why weren't you there??).  They were talking about doing it again when it got warm and i fully support it.  I had a wonderful time."

Oh yeah, my computer crashes as i am working on a paper i have an hour later.  This happened at 1 and it still wont work so i email my teacher and i get a letter grade off b/c my computer hates me.  Grr David is coming tonight to fix it (among other things) but he can't be sure that he will be able to save it...i might lose everything.  This is not a good day.

You do not cut love out of construction paper, or glue it together, you have...THE SEX. No ""Making Love"". You can be in love, or you can not be in love, the act can have different levels of meaning, but it is still THE SEX.""

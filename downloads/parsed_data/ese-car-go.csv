"event","When my parents&nbsp;said they were going to be coming up for a day to do an inspection on the new duplex they are buying, I underestimated the amount of energy needed to get through the day. I really&nbsp;should have started it with coffee.<br /><br />For some reason,&nbsp;this morning, I was almost out of bed a full hour early. The early hours of&nbsp;8:30 on saturdays&nbsp;must just make me unable to read a clock. After that extra hour of sleep, i got dressed (and it was actualy in a <em>dress</em>! fancy that!) and drove to the airport to pick up my parents. I got there at the most perfect time... As I was about to come to a halt at the passenger arrival gate, out they both walked! Talk about perfect! And they were even able to bring the shoe racks as carry-on! So now there is a place to stack shoes at the front door&nbsp; and then one in my room because there was no space for another on there. So no, when there are people over, the front door will open with no problems! No more shoe-impeading-door-opening-function!<br /><br />&nbsp;Then we started driving and my parents make a comment about wanting to go to Home(less) Depot... Of course, this was when we were at like 8th street and we had just been waiting to cross the river and all that. Arn't they just dears? I pacify my mother with thoughts of you to Teacher's Trunk. A place where teachers so in with money and come out with things their classroom <em>needs!</em>&nbsp; Then we went to Duplex #1 and I can't rememebr what happened after that... hummm...&nbsp;i think we went to visit my uncle at home..<br /><br />Then we went back across the river to Home Depot.. had some Subway for lunch.. then went inside. While we were there we got another light fixture for our place so there is now a new one int the dinning room and the kitchen, picked out a fixture for my room because we don't know where mine went for my room, got another recycling bin for the closet (speaking of which, i want to remember to bring in that recycling tomorrow), and some cleaning clothes and a squigie to do the windows.<br /><br />After unloading this all back at Duplex #1, it was almost time to go inspect Duplex #2. There was just enough time to go and put up the kitchen light fixture. The other duplex is ver close to this some... you just follow the road and to end up going past it. While we were there, my dad did his engineering inspecting of the house, looking at all the important structual, electrical, ect things to do with it. The place is quite nice.... very suprised at how brigh it is in the basement and how much space there is in the living area! And blue walls in kitchen! Yeah&nbsp; colour!<br /><br />Back at Duplex #1, we put together the shoe racks and then me and mom went to Wal-Mart to get some curtain stuff for the side enterance becuase she said the towel collects moisture and that is bad for the door. So now i am incharge of making a curtain from the material we bought.... this could get interesting lol...<br />While we were gone, my dad put up the other light and made a hole in the entrance way closet door for a handle. Unfortunetly, he put it at the end, not the middle, where it needs to be&nbsp;inorder to open the door. We now have a hole in our brand new closet door.<br /><br />At 5:30, it was off to Moxies for supper with my aunt and uncle. It was purdy good. By 7:20 we were back at Duplex #1 and put up my light and put pictures for Duplex #2 on my computer to email away, then off to the car so i could take them to the airport. Thats when my dad realized he did not have his jacket. After some searching it was decided he must have left it at Duplex #2 while he was inspecting it. So we were off in a flash zooming around easthill&nbsp; to it and he knocked on the door and sure enough, it was there.&nbsp; Good thing too becuase that is where the car keys to my parents car, at the edmonton airport, were kept.<br /><br />So one last time over the river, to the airport and I dropped them off. The started the whole issue of me having enough energy to go out tonight.&nbsp;<br /><br />Needing to get something from Jordan's, I stopped off there before going to pick up Kaelyn. Thats when i got asked if I had taken the cat. Assuring James I had not, I began a search (which had already been done by James, but second set of eyes is good). Upon finding to hit of the furball, I aske if she couls be outside or near the laundry. Taking the latter, James the former, we searched... Then James comes back and gets a chair and says he's found her! Up in a pine tree... where there are of course to branches on the bottem, so can't be climbed&nbsp;easily. After some stuggle and hearing her continuous meows, a neighbor came over with another chair and said he would stand on both chairs and then he scrambled up and grabed the scared kitten... who clamped onto his leg while being lowered. Jamed got her and I got her form James... and I am suprised but I was not scrached at all.. Hope the others faired that well too! After bringing her inside and she devoering some food, i took a bruch to her and got out most of the burrs attached to her... And she still never scratched me...she squirmed a little but thats to be expected. hehehe.. silly kitten!<br /><br />Getting back on track to the whole picking up kaelyn thing, I head over to her house, then to pick up alison and heading us all over to the duplex. Then to go see jordan at work to tell hime about his kitten and to get the hatched out of his car. Apparently the hatchet was in my basement all along and I could have given it to my uncle when he was here... oh well.. I'll go drive over their tomorrow.<br /><br />By this time, I am tired... and i decided not to join in with all the pretty looking people and stay home while they go to Whiskey Jacks. After enjoying a few nice cups of teas with Sean and some good conversation,&nbsp;<br />Time for bed<br /><br />Then Daniel and Jenn came home....<br />and for some reason i decided a good way to finish off a long day where i end up being super tired, is to stay up and write this, instead of sleeping, I might not be bright but I swear I have some other good qualities!<br /><br />Good Night!"

"event","Last night me and daniel looked at pictures we both had on our computers.It was alot of fun and reminded me of the past 4 years. One thing that is for sure, Jenn, I am very glad I met you and that we kept in touch. If not I think my life would have been very different and I would probably be alot lonelyer. I never would have met Daniel and Kaelyn(which seems unthinkable now)!So Thanks Jenn :) I am glad we were the normal looking ones and that we were put on the same shift and had a blast that summer and that we are still as crazy as we ever were...athough we have been writing less notes lately...

Another thing I realized was that me and my brother,Grason, actually look alike. Okay maybe not much but now I do see a resemblence. So much for thinking he was not related! (Out goes that deam!) We both have some of the same facile expression and our face shape is not that different. I just can't beleive that I never saw the resemblence before...

I was also prompted by the pictures to remember something. Jordan I need to send you that picture of you beung creepy... It is just a very very funny picture and I have yet to remember to send it to you. Also, the ones of you with that black silly putty stuff on our face is allso very funny... hehehe

On another note this was funny. Me and Dannieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee (hehehee) were looking at pistures and then he looked at his alarm clock and it was 2. he responded with "" what!? 2? I thought it ws like 10!"" ""But that moive ended at 11"" ""I don't care!""
hehehe.. good times

Daniel also put some more quotes on my door! yeah! It was a very good snow day.Watched The Incredables, Finding Nemo and Sunset Blvd. Ate tater tots, leftover past and had some hot capicino and got to use my little frother. Sat in a chair for a better portion of the day, told Jordan he forgot his wallet here, skipped my classes, read 6 pg in my-er daniels- Sociology book, found out there were 75 km/hr winds and that it was very coooold out there.

Ahh!Phone!!!IT WAS ACTUALLY FOR ME!! CRAZY!!HABBET YEAH!!

After looking at alot of pictures, me and daniel came to a conclusion,
We need to take more videos.

So good news, I got into my 9:00 Monday Art History Class.
Bad News, I got into my 9:00 AM Monday Morning Class. And it is in the Morning. 
And I have a 9:00 Am Tuesday Morning. It is also an Art History Class.

I get to choose a popular culture image to do my essay on. We can pick anything and then we have to trace it back and see how much it has changed. I think I want to do the legend of Robin Hood and then Robin Hood men in tights. Or I was thinking Zombies. How they have been viewed in the past and how different that is from now... Like how they were scary and now we laugh when the get their head cut off.
hehehehe...

i should do soemthing today"

"event","so i had a dream last night.... it was a three part dream.. i can't really remember the 3rd part though.. but it was there
part 1:
I was sitting at a picnic bench on a street that was a couple blocks away from a street like white ave in edmonton... i had this little set of tools and i was playing with them.. there were the kinda ones you would use for like drywalling... one was like a square mesh box on a stick... another had glue in it and thelast one was like a pick... i have not idea what they were but w/e... anyways i was just playihng with them on this bench then these three old guys were walking down the street.... then one of them went away and the other 2 were just staring at me... they freaked me ou and i started running...they chased me... and then i threw a tool at them and was thinking "" what the hell can i do with this square one???!?"".. and i just kept running...
then i dashed inside a store and hid behind a half wall.... and was so scared... then theses three younger guys came into the store and gave me a funny look.. then after they left  i went out of the store... and the young guys were standing there and asked me if i wanted a ride somewhere... and i did but i was so freaked out that i was just like "" no.. i'm fine!!"" and tghen started running again....

told you it was weird

part 2:
so me and heather go to a backstreet boy concert.... (i know.. werid eh?).. and then we got a ride with them in their station wagon... then we drove around... then we stoped at this place.. got some juice.... and it had art all over the walls... then  i was like "" i forgot my shoes! and my other suff"" so me and heather decided to walk back to the univercity to get it.. and one of them cam with us.. we walked past a long bus.... and just kept walking... 

i don't get that part at all.....but w/e

part 3:
.. i know there was something.... i'll ask my mother.. io told her all about it when o got up thismorning...  maybe she will bost my memory..

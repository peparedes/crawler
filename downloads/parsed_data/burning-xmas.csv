It's just a bunch of stupid questions that I have to answer and I don't really care about them at all.  It wouldn't be too bad if they were easier to find, but you have do go to different websites for each one.  *sigh*  It's just torture.

I'm so tired.  I haven't been able to sleep very well lately.  Plus I don't get much time to sleep anyway.

On the up side I met a really cute guy at work yesterday.  He asked if we had Dir en Grey in.  I wanted to jump up and down right then and there and yell, ""Oh my God!!!  You listen to J-rock too!!!""  But I didn't.  I should've given him my number, but I didn't because I'm not the type that gives it out all that easily.  We didn't have it, of course.  Like any place around here carries much anime, much less J-rock, but whatever.

Well, I should go now and continue with my shitty homework."

"event","*sniff, sniff*  I'm sorry I couldn't go to moon fest.  My parents (well mainly my dad) were being all controling yet again.  Basically, since they don't know you guys, I can't really hang out much.  They've always been that way, I thought it might be a little different since I'm 19 now, but no, they have to know absolutely everything.
Anyway, Dad went on this whole tirade about how they don't leave the house without them telling me where they're going and leaving names and numbers and an approximate time when they'll be back.  I of course agreed with him because if I said differently there'd be hell to pay, but let's get real.  There have been times that they've been gone for hours and I didn't know where they were, what they were doing, or if they'd gotten into an accident or anything.  A perfect example was earlier in the day when Mom said she was going Christamass shopping.  Okay.  SHe was gone for at least three hours and I didn't know where she was going shopping.  And then there's all those times they go out saying they're going here, but end up going somewhere else.  But god forbid I ever bring this up with them.
Speaking of god, Dad also took this time to yell at me for missing two masses.  Well, I guess I'm going to hell.  *rolls eyes*  He told me that skipping church was not going to be tolerated in his house, and that I've had a trend of skipping church.  That isn't true.  I've been going to everyother mass the pass five masses.  Not like he's one to talk.  We've gone months as a family without going to church.  Not to mention that he missed the seven o'clock mass that he wanted us all to go to this Sunday.
Anyway, basically what I'm trying to say is that my parents are old, hypocritaical, tight-fisted foggies, and they don't trust me.  *shrugs*  I'm not sure why.  I only ever did one thing behind their back and I only did that because I knew how Dad would react.  And I know I keep my personal life seperate from them, but who can blame me when my dad points to a guy with green hair, piercings, and tatoos and tells me, ""You better not do anything like that.""  Sorry, but most of my friends look that way.  *shakes head*  Let's just ostarsize your daughter.
*sigh*  I know that this was a long apology, but I wanted you to understand that I really did want to go, and I wanted you to understand why I couldn't."

Because I pronounce both a's like ""ah"" as in father, not ""a"" as in ate or mango the fruit.  So I clarified myself and pronounced the first a as a long a.  Anyway, he was yelling at me that I was pronouncing it wrong and blah-dy, blah-dy, blah.
Anyway, most of the stuff that I have read on any Japanese pronunciation says that it's ""ah.""  It took all I had not to yell right back at him and tell him my full opinion of the ethnocentrism of America and how most Americans have their heads shoved too far up their asses to realize that we speak English, not ""American"" (there's no such language as ""American""), much less pronounce foreign words correctly.  Not to mention he was telling me how stupid anime is and everything.  Needless to say the guy went way down on my list, not that he was very high up to begin with.
I'm obviously very sensitive about my anime and manga.  I almost yelled at a customer who called them Chinese comics.  *shudders*  I really had to bite my tongue on that one.

My parents and Carly went to Disney for her birthday.  I couldn't go since I work tomorrow morning and they wouldn't get back until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.

I survived the hurricane.  The eye went right over where I lived.  We lost power, the phone line, a few shingles, and a few little trees.  We were lucky though.  Some of our neighbors have some pretty extensive damage.  We also got our power back three days after.  There are a lot of people still without.  Overall, the worst part about it was the cold showers.  I'm sure if it were hotter than it was I'd complain aout the heat, but thanks to the cold front I didn't have to deal with it.

The first time was at Dairy Queen when I was applying.  I was sitting there and one of the younger guys of a group of mentally handicapped people came over and started hitting on me.  Laugh!  Laugh all you want, but it's true!  He wanted me to come to some of his baseball games.  Then at Hastings, the handicapped people always came in my line when I was working.  Always.  None of them hit on me like the other guy did, but still, they never went to anybody else's line.  And at Publix, he asked me to go to Wendy's with him.  Maybe I'm making too big a deal about it.  But still, it's just weird.
Of course my love life is weird anyway.
There was also this 13 or 14 year old boy that had a huge crush on me in Michigan.  I'm serious.  He would hold my hand and try and cuddle and everything.  It was odd...very odd.

I just got back form an interview at Sam Goody.  It'll only be seasonal, but I could work 10 hours and get a discount.  *begins to cry*  I need my anime and jrock.  Anyway, when I got home I had a message from Linens and Things.  They want me to come in for and interview as well.  I told them sorry though.  I don't want to work at Linens and Things.  I just put the application in because I needed a stinkin' job.
Other than that, Mom thinks I have an attitude.  Mainly because she asked me to call before I left work last night because I worked to close.  When I called she asked ""I thought you were supposed to work to 11.""  11 is close on a Sunday night for Publix.  We don't allow customers in after 10, but the employees have to stay and take care of everything.  They usually give us an hour, but sometimes it takes longer, sometimes it's shorter.  Last night it was longer since everything was f'ed up by all the stupid customers.  Anyway, I didn't understand why she was all, ""Why didn't you call sooner?""  I called her when I was told to call.  I'm not really allowed to make phone calls unless it's an emergency, and it wasn't.  Not to mention the whole plan I'm on.  And then throw in the fact that the same thing happened Friday night and they didn't say anything about it.  Anyway, since I was on a total lack of sleep I told her that I was at Publix and that she could talk to Allison or Kedrin if she wanted to.  Then she yelled at me to watch my attitude and gave me a speech not only when I got home last night, but this after noon too.  *rolls eyes*  She said the exact same thing.  And as far as my attitude goes, it's not all affected by Carly getting control of most of the house, me having to be stuck on the floor of the room trying to do homework because the bed's not accomodating and I can't do it at the table because Carly's there, or the fact that Dad basically accused me Saturday night in the way he yelled at me down the stairs asking what my uncle wanted when I wasn't home to answer the freakin' phone because I had to take Carly to the pool.  Nope, nothing that happens in this house affects my attitude, or the fact that I haven't been able to sleep.
Other than that, I'm doing pretty good.  I will stop complaining and continue on in my madness."

I got hired at Barnes and Noble.  I'm so happy!  The pay's a little less, but it's closer to my house, so less for gas.  And it's fewer hours, which I wanted anyway so that I could actually have some relaxation time.  Plus, I'd much rather work at a book store.  Anybody who knows me could tell you that.  I'm a sucker for books.

I'm actually supposed to be doing homework.  I'm researching some stuff about jrock for a speech.  I have to find ""published"" sources, which I have, it just sucks because most of the actual information comes from fans that just put up sites.

The problem: it's not released yet, and I can't find a freakin' release date for it either.  *starts cursing under breath*  Sorry, I get a little frustrated after scanning article after article about useless information just to see if it's something I could use.

Unfortunately I had to join the crowd.  Mom made me pick up some things since I had no school today.  But guess what, no ice.  There was also basically no water.

Anyway, my parents were talking about cutting back on sweets and stuff.  That's cool, whatever.  It's not like I eat them a whole lot.  Guess what they bought when they went to the grocery store?  Cake, ice-cream, and all sorts of candy.  So much for cutting back on the sweets.
Went to Barnes&Noble tonight.  I couldn't find a book that I wanted.  That's never happened before.  Of course part of the blame could be the fact that I was majorly picky tonight, searching for things in particular.  Didn't find a single one that suited me.  Wanted a book on mythology, something besides Greek/Roman.  They had some, just not any that I wanted.  Looked for Grimms' Fairy Tales, the original stuff.  It was all the fluffy stuff.  Wanted something on demons, *rolls eyes* still couldn't find much of anything.
I've just gotten really picky lately.  *shrugs*  Hopefully it'll pass.
I'm hungry.  I shouldn't be, but I am.  I will now go and try to console the little devil."

Anyway, I checked to see if they had Taka there.  *bows head* They didn't.  Curse them!!  I did get the new ShojoBeat though, yay^^.  More God Child, Absolute Boyfriend, Nana, and Crimson Hero.  So happy.  I probably shouldn't have bought it, what with being poor and all.  I also want to get Sin City.  It's awesome, but I'm going to have to wait until I get a steady pay check.
I also stopped by the library.  A book I had put on hold came in.  Overall it's been a pretty good day.
I love G4.  That's my new favorite channel.  It was Cartoon Network, but they've gone to the Dark Side.  They have educational cartoons on in the morning.  The evil of it all!!

"event","Okay, just finished watching the last episodes of Furuba.  *sniff, sniff* So sad!!  You know, the manga wasn't as intense.  I don't remember feeling half as emotionally drained reading it as I do watching it.

I applied at Publix.  Hopefully they'll call.  They're hiring too, so *crosses fingers* hopefully they'll call and they'll hire me.  With all the applications I've been filling out I'm really close to memorizing the addresses and phone numbers of my former employer's, but also every person I can possibly list as a contact.  Everything else I can fill out from memory.  What a waste of perfectly good brain cells ><.

Anyway, I had a really weird dream this morning.  It was shortly before my alarm went off.  It was like some crazy soap opera (which I hate) that I was unfortunately thrown into the middle of.  I don't remember a whole lot of it.  I do remember that it started out okay, but then got really annoying and bothersome.  The weirdest part though is while I was trying to wake myself up (I manage to do that when dreams start to piss me off) I heard someone calling my name.  I've called my name myself before to wake myself up, but this wasn't my voice, and it didn't feel like I was doing it.  I know I sound crazy, but that's because I am ^^.  Anyway, I actually thought that there was someone in the room trying to wake me up, my dad does that a lot, but when I woke up, no one was there, and my dad's out of town this week.  Anyway, I was kind of weirded out, but not enough to keep myself awake.  I rolled over and went back to sleep.  (I'm not a morning person at all).  Then my alarm went off shortly after and I rolled myself out of bed and got ready to take my little sister to school.

That was my morning, and as you can tell, I'm now chillin' at the computer.  I still have to buy books for my classes.  They're so fscking expensive.  *sigh* I'm also taking calculus this semester because I need math credit and calculus is the highest I can go with my SAT score.  (When I looked at my score I found I did better than I remembered.  I don't know why, but for some reason I thought I had bombed it.)  Anyway, I don't really want to take the math class.  I'm really good at math, I just don't like doing it a whole lot.  I'd rather take art classes, but I have no natural talent in art.  I'm such a left brainer.  *lowers head*

Carly tried to watch Fruits Basket with me. I told her she couldn't watch it. She says, ""Mom's and Dad's rules."" ""Yep.""

This strike often causes me to be nauseous and unable to eat or drink much of anything, which is bad because they tell you to stay hydrated when you're sick.  I really ought to try to get my tonsils taken out because they cause way too much trouble for me.  Honestly, it's the side effects of the swelling that really screw me up.  I feel fine otherwise.
What sucks even more is that I went to bed early yesterday and drank a ton of orange juice just so I wouldn't feel bad today.  Obviously it didn't work because I feel worse.  So instead of doing much of anything, I've been fiddling around on the computer, trying to get caught up on all the stuff I've missed since being booted off, which is a lot, and killing brain cells.

The reason I came across this thought was because if I was alone watching tv I had the volume pretty low, but as soon as anybody walks in the room I have to at least turn it up a quarter of what it already is in order to begin to hear it.  Not only that, but they talk loudly too (especially Carly who loves to scream most of the time.  She can be heard on the phone from another room without really trying to be.).  I don't know why, but they feel they must talk loudly and it gets on my nerves.  Oh well.  I'll deal.
I have also decided that I'm not a very good conversationalist.  I'm not very good with talking to people.  Not that I mind talking to people.  I actually enjoy talking to people, it's just I don't think you have to talk to be friendly.  I also don't like to talk when I don't have something to say (which I usually don't).  Even if I did have something to say it's not usually something that many people would be interested in, so I don't say anything.

Anyway, Dad thinks I haven't been getting out of the house enough.  The truth is I'm getting out of it more with him here than when he's gone.
Carly's been spending a lot of time on the computer lately.  A lot more than I ever do.  It's stupid too.  The way my parents favor her on stupid things like that.  She's allowed more on the internet now than I ever have been.  They still don't like me on it that much.
Dad also got onto me for telling Carly to stop throwing stuff.  She was 'making her bed' and throwing her stuffed animals at me and my belongings.  I just told her she needed to stop throwing things because she was going to break something (which she was and it would've been mine!!).  Then Dad yells at me from another room to let him take care of Carly while he's home.  Fine by me.  But wouldn't taking care of her include helping her in the shower (which I did), taking her to the park (which I did), and making sure her crap is picked up so there's actually a place to sit in the living room (I didn't do that today because Dad would've yelled at me, but I certainly make sure that the house is decent when Mom comes home so that she isn't totally stressed out and Dad hasn't even bothered with that)?  I hate it when they do crap like that to me.  They always say ""Let us take care of her,"" or ""She's not your kid.""  That's great and all, but when you buy her a toy to 'keep her occupied' while you buy movie tickets for later in the evening then you're spoiling her and neither Mike or I were ever spoilt that way.  And Carly's a little brat most of the time as it is, she doesn't need any help.

Well, I did not feel like entertaining anyone so I headed off to my room to draw and listen to my music.  Since Carly (7), April (around 6), and Aspen (around 12) were in the house I couldn't really listen to any of my good American music (because of the language and all that) so I started listening to my JRock.  Well, Aspen decides to tell me that T.M.Revolution sucks, that L'Arc~en~ciel can't sing or play, and that Gackt sounds stupid.  Needless to say that I was pissed.  Especially since she's in to all that little kid pop/rock crap where the musicians (if you want to call them that) don't even begin to write any of there stuff and are complete sell outs--like Creed and Metallica.  Then her little sister starts telling me that my music sucks (she listens to Mandy Moore, even better.  Aspen continues to tell me that my taste in American music sucks also (which basically consists of My Chemical Romance and NIN right now).  It took everything I had not to tell the little brats off right there.  I mean it's not my fault that they weren't allowed to listen to anything worth listening to.  And it's definitely not my fault that they've been brainwashed by the rest of the stupid Americans into thinking that America is the best country (which it's not).

I got an early start this morning.  I got up to do a scan at work for 6:00 AM.  I'm not a morning person.  Anyway, I got there to find that the scan had been canceled, and nobody bothered to call me.  I can't wait to get a descent job and get the hell out of Arkansas.  I so don't belong here.
I had to laugh at my mom yesterday.  She was ticked at Carly and told her ""Spit in one hand and want in the other.  See which on fills up faster.""  Is that not a country saying or what.  I just started cracking up in the middle of Target.  Then Mom turned to me, ""I've been in Arkansas too, long haven't I?""
Can't wait to move."

Anyway, isn't the pic pretty?  It's one of my favorite animes, Fruits Basket.  The manga's awesome too!
I'm gonna go now and watch Saiyuki."

"event","I'm such an internet addict.  I get on the computer and must go to all these websites even if I should be doing work. *hangs head in shame*  I have this really big paper I have to do for class, and I'm supposed to be working on it, but guess what.  I'm not.
I'm hungry, so I'm gonna go eat now.
2 more days to my birthday.
This is the most random entry I've done yet.  Go me!"

"event","I'm moving soon, so I've been going through my stuff and getting rid of a lot of it.  It's a pain.  I also think we might have termites again or they might be ants.  Not that it really matters because we rent, but still.

The weirdest thing happened a few nights ago.  I was checking people out at work and this kid came with a couple of his friends to my line and insisted that he knew me.  I didn't know who the hell he was which is unusual considering I'm really good with faces.  I might not remember your name, but I will remember your face.  Anyway, I didn't argue with him about our knowing each other because that's mean and blah, blah, blah.  He kept on talking and told me that his brother really likes me.  I'm like okay.  He goes on to say that he talks about me all the time and that he wants to go out with me.  I find this a bit creepy.  I have no idea who this guy is, much less who his brother is.

Anyway, I guess that's all.  My pizza's almost ready, so yah."

"event","Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Lent is finally over!  I just finished watching a bunch of anime, and I'm gonna watch more.  You know why?  Because I can!!

Anyway.  I really need to make my pages look pretty, but I don't know how.  It's not like I have to do this anytime soon because it's not like anybody really reads this anyway.

I'm home by myself right now.  My parents are gone for about a week, which means freedom to get on the net.  Yes!

Well, I guess that's all. I don't really feel like writing, but I do feel like making the page beautiful, so I'll go and see what I can find out.  Later."

"event","Okay, so it's really late, or early depends on how you look at it, and I'm home alone, but I just had to complain.  Where to begin.  First off, lets just say that I'm a legal adult for starters and my parents still treat me like I'm thirteen.  They went out of town tonight and are coming back Saturday afternoon.  So my mother gave me all these directions on what to do.  ""In case of emergency call....  If the weather gets to bad call....  Their last name is....""  Okay!  I get it!
Before I left for work they told me to call them when I got home.  I told them I would.  I also told them that I was getting a ride with someone who was working to close so I'd be staying there until they got done (which they needed me anyway, so I got paid for it).  Anyway,  I guess around 11:10 they started calling the house.  Where I work (Hastings an entertainment store that sells books, music, movies, and rents as well for those of you who don't know what one is)doesn't officially close until 11:oo.  Which means we don't lock our doors until then which means that poeple come in at the last minute to look at stuff, which means we can't start really closing until everyone leaves which is about 11:20.  (There were a lot of ""whiches"" in that sentence.)  It also takes at least 20 minutes to get from work to home.  So basically they were calling way too early.  So what do they do?  They call Hastings to check up on me.  Niiicee.  Anyway, I told them that we hadn't left yet and that I'd call them when I got home, which I did.  And you know what they asked me?  Are you alone?  What the hell is that supposed to mean?!?  I mean get real.  I'm not going to sleep with anybody.  I'm so not interested in that right now, not to mention so not ready.  And let's not forget about the fact that I'm Christian and don't want to have sex until I'm married (and the way life's been going I'm not even sure I want to get married).
It just really urks me that my parents don't have any faith in me what-so-ever.  I mean the only real time I ever really lied to them was about Thea, and then I didn't do anything wrong.  If you don't believe me u=you can ask her yourself.  But I guess it really doesn't matter since God knows what happened.
I had some more to complain about, but I'm hungry, and getting sleepy, so I might update again tonight, and I might not.  Later."

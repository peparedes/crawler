i have been busting my ass to find a job but its just good enough for them. i am still the worst child on the planet to them .

i have been wanting his attention but all he has been doing the past three days is push me aside (or so it feels like) i know he doesnt hear my side but i sit home crying when he is out with friends i know they are his friends and i shouldnt be upset but he is leaveing me in August and i just want to make our last few months special i love him no matter how much he wants us to be over. i am just a part but he is more then a part i  dont know why maybe its cuz of all the shit i am going threw right now with my mom and a job and i feel like no one wants me around ne more i feel like no one cares ne more i feel as if i die today who will care. ne way so much is running threw my head and baby i know you are going to read this and be like w/e its drama but baby this is how i feel and i am sick of it i need to talk to you i need you!!!!!!! baby i love you more then ne one i have ever been with and i want everyone to know it no matter if you want to hide it or not i love you no one has ever made me feel like you have when we are on good days and i have never longed for someone as much as i long for you when your gone. thats why i take it so hard when i cant see you cuz your with friends but i know i have to live with it because i am a part of your life. i want these next two months to be special baby and i know your trying to balance your time with two jobs me and your friends i know this is how you want it but its hard for me to except i love you jeff :-*"

"event","Well i've been busy lately.... Went on a camping trip to lost river it was lots of fun... then came back to realize that highschool is really over. Senior meeting was yesterday and we played red rover and then i hung out with jeff and his friends. but everyone at the meeting i will probaly never see again in my life :-( it sux. today was reality check tho it was graduation rehersal and yeah i realize that wow high school is over but thats not half as upseting as that i came to realize i have accomplished nothing my whole high school career. Its like i am grauating with nothing there is no point to graduation unless you have something to be proud of i know so many people that have done awesome and i congraulate you! but i guess i have to face the fact that i screwed up and I aint happy to be leaveing highschool at all.
i'm going to miss everyone so much when we all go off our sperate ways. honestly does anyone really expect to stay in touch I would love to stay in touch but reality its not likely. 


Good bye everyone i'll miss you all"

I had a good day today i finally was with erica for a lil while. while we worked out but it felt like there was still something wrong and we werent our selves near eachother... but i got over that and then i went on the motorcyle with jeff :-D we went to see airplanes i loved it... but on the downside i cant hold in all my feelings ne more but yet i have no one to talk to i mean jeff is here but i know how much he hates complaining so i feel bad but like an awesome friend/boyfriend he listens. I have so much to say but i've been trying to keep the peace i just dont know how much longer thats gonna happen me and alyssa were talking today and she says i should let it out but there is no point in trying when i know how it will end. but i cant deal with drama right now when i have worse problems... some problems that i havent told ne one but i kinda need to and i dont want to bore jeff i mean threw everything (my grandmother, alex shit and angie and erica shit) he has been there to either make fun of me (witch is funny) or actually care and comfort me. Not once has he complained about being here for me. but hey i know where i stand with everyone now. I cant wait to go to college cuz highschool has been such a joke to me so much bad shit happend in gateway and WORSE shit happend last year and this year was looking good and is looking even better i mean come on!! i get to ride a motorcycle and cling to jeff :-D... you know my life could be so much worse and yet so cant everyones so why do ppl complain most for attention and some just because it becomes to much for thenselves to handle, but most ppl i know just want to cause drama but this time i aint looking for attention i have no bestfriend to talk to at this moment so i needed some where to get this all out so i did it here and if your gonna get mad at hold this entry against me you cant cuz i warned you in the begining"

"event","well i am taking a break from doing my project and read journals... interesting stuff i found lol... any way i was doing my bestfriend section fopr my yearbook thing and well i have 2 pages dedicated to bestfriends and i was working on one specific it was the whole page i am dedicating to erica i desided to do this be for our fight but you know reading her journal makes me think. this is wrong and she is the MOST IMPORTANT person in my life and in 8 yrs this is our first huge fight and no matter what she is at me right now(pissed upset hurt) this page is for her and i dont tend to lose her friendship like i have lost others she is to god damn important to me and yes we both said hurtful things but i felt attacked and was defending myself for doing stuff i feel is untrue not all is wrong i'll admit sometimes i dont show that she is important to me but sometimes she does the same. This fight is just drama taken to a new level a hurtful level and i aint ready to forgive and forget either but i do believe we both have things to work on but not alone i didnt do as much wrong as she thinks i just sometimes my life problems become over whelming too but mine are mostly from the past i never kept ne thing important from her unless it was indandering me even then i probbly told her. this past week all i could think about was if she was ok and alot of ppl know that. but not all will admit it i dont see how she can say i dont care or i aint compassionate cuz all i thought about was her and i was giveing her room to breathe but i guess i was wrong and i dont care ne mroe about who was right and who was wrong i just want this to go away to figure out where our friendship stands. to lose her is like loseing sara a sister is never replaceable... but hey its in her court i wont forget this fight but i will work together to fix things after time (and not all of it is my fault i did nothing wrong i just got side tracked with my life too as did she and i strongly believe that)... this is the last thing i have to say about the fight cuz hopefully the next time i write the fight will be over."

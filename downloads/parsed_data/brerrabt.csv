yesterday i ate so much and lunch was great, it was subway. then today i got lots of school stuff to be happy about. 1) 102.7% in APUS! 2) 96 on bio test. 3) internship application! 4) invited to go to europe to earn school credit. 5)student of the month for science? i did not ever expect that one.

ive been promised a car...thats exciting too
only thing that sucked about today was mom wouldnt let me go to the movies with leanne and jenny, so were going next thurs instead. itll be fun! now i actually have something to do tues, thurs, friday of next week! wednesday is still free someone find something we can do!
 this week will definitely be great, i plan on stay up late.

hmm well i guess i really should have friends with me when i go to the mall, based on what stephanie just told me....creepy

"event","hm my last entry was...weird

nothings really happened since then. i hate calculus thats whats happend. oh and like loads of people found out who i like but i dont really care anymore. whatever happens happens. the homestaed thing is cancelled, i really did want to do that, it gave me something to do. i hate english. field trip monday! i cant wait for that. i get to drive to school too! tehn it off to sammys house to study. hmm i dont think im allowed to go to the mall like ever. i think ill try to get a day where like everyone whos offered to go (well at least one person has to go with me) with me will go and then ill ask my parents. its just SO HIGHLY DANGEROUS because of course i wont fight back when i get abducted??! i need to go somewhere i think im going crazy. if my parents keep doing this to me i will. it is not possible for me to stay at home. im not that kind of person. i need to get out but to do that i need someone to go with me. not an adult, they annoy me. i need like a friend to go with me. whatever itll happen eventually. cant wait till college.

ok im done for now"

"event","i havent been here in a while. i dont remember last time i updated. i love the snow. its snowed 3 times in the past week or so. i called drew to rub it in his face. that was fun. when i told him i didnt have the patience to talk anymore cause i was hyper, he asked if he could call the house. told him no, it felt great. what a retard. 
i think i like someone else now. not quite sure. whatever. 
i cant sleep well anymore but i dont really mind. i like laying in the dark. it gives me time to think. 
started playing my guitar last week. its been awesome i love it. great fun. good way to annoy my parents too. im sorta sick of them. i cant do anything. its not fun. wont let me go to the mall by myself, movies by myself. college will be great. lots of work but still something i love and there will be parties thrown in there. most people say they cant picture me at a party. to that i say: just wait.
ive been thinking lots about college. i dont know where i want to go. except that its away from here. maybe west, maybe south. not north. i really need to think more about it. itll come to me one day where i want to go. i hate decisions. 
why do i think so much about stuff thats far away? well i guess its not that far away but im already thinking about it. i dont like that.
im gonna end this now.
ill type more later, or not. maybe tomorrow"

"event","ok i know i havent updated for reall in a while. my computer internet explorer wasnt working and netscape just took too long to get here (NETSCPAE SUCKS). so i fixed the computer and now i can update! 


I saw harry potter last saturday night. best hp movie yet. they did leave a lot out though...still liked it!

i was selling cookies at the giant in prince frederick all last weekend. that was highly entertaining despite the fact i thought i was gonna be really boring. it was entertaining b/c 1) there was an in door and an out door and it just cracked me up to see people standing at the out door wondering why it wasnt letting them in 2) there was this like 8 yr old kid who ran out into the parking lot, through traffic, sat down and then faced off with a car. for the lovely finale he ran back across traffic to his mom. i know im mean cause he coulda got hurt but it was hysterical ok reason 3) one of the cart guys who works at that giant is really cute (or so I thought, angela didnt think so)!
then i basically did absolutely nothing on monday and tuesday
wednesday i sold cookies at the safeway in prince frederick. not nearly as fun: 1) mostly b/c there wasnt a cute guy within like 10 miles!!! 2) IT WAS 20 FLIPPING DEGREES

but i survived....

then on thursday i went to dinner at aunt karens and uncle vinces. i can never really figure out who i s drunk there. i just cant tell! i hung out mostly with Cassidy, shes fun. i really dont like turkey.

today i  went to my grandmothers house in waldorf. from there me and sarah went to petsmart and bougth a bed for ru! its so cute. then we went to the waldorf mall. i feel like we were the only 2 white people there. it was a complete zoo. waldorf traffic sucks by the way. went back to nanas from there. then shelby came, i played with molly (SHES SO CUTE) then i drove shelbys jetta and we went and got leftys bbq. i like that jetta. went back and ate then we went to the mall again just to make fun of stupid people. that was great. then from there we hit starbucks and then safeway for whole milk. went back to nanas and then left for home with mom. tacos for dinner! and now im sitting here freezing my butt off.

she says in her asian accent "" i was trying to tell you to back up to let me in but thats ok you pulled forward instead so.."" shes a lil miffed by now. so our light goes green and dad started to pull away. before we completely are away she says ""you asshole!"" so were away my dad does the goofy thing again ""oh guess now im an asshole. do i look like an asshole to you?"" it was very hilarious....

today was good but it wasnt terrible. just one of those boring old days. oh i miss my horse. i went over there for the first time yesterday...it felt so weird not seeing him there, it was very saddening. i cried for him again. today i didnt go over there hardly at all. i walk over to see sarah with one of the kittens. i think the kitty is sick which is really super sad. its nose is green and runny and it sleeps all the time  and it doesnt try to run like any other wild cats. just kinda sits and hisses. no claws or anything, then you pick it up and it just sorta plops down. it wheezes too, but my sister thougth it was purring. i hope its ok. its a cute kitty. i didnt finish my bio lab...that makes me sad
i hardly did any homework today. its weird. im not really in a good mood
oh i hope everyone enjoyed their nyc trip today!

here it is:
A teacher was leaning over the shoulder of one of her students, when she noticed the pencil the girl was using had the Ten Commandments listed on it. ""I like your pencil very much,"" said the teacher. ""So do I,"" replyed the girl, ""thats why i stole it from my brother.""

ok another one cuz that one wasnt the best:

The sign clearly read: ""NO LEFT TURN MONDAY THRU FRIDAY"" but the driver did it anyways. When the police officer pulled him over, the manprotested, ""You can't give me a ticket!""
""Why?"" responded the officer.
""Because its Wednesday!"" the driver said.
""So?""
""Read the sign,"" he insisted, ""No left turn Monday, Thursday, and Friday!""

Joe and Dave are hunting when Dave keels over. Frantic, Joe dials 911 on his cellphone and blurts, ""My friend just dropped dead! What should I do?"" A soothing voice at the other end says, ""Dont worry, I can help. First, let's make sure he's really dead."" After a brief silence the operator hears a shot. Then Joe comes back to the phone.

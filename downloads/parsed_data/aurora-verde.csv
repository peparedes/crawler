"event","*stolen from Rachel*  >.>

1. What did you do in 2015 that you'd never done before?
Well, I suppose getting on a plane, crossing an ocean and visiting a new country alone is something I've never done before....  

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
I don't bother with them.

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
Rachel did to a beautiful little girl!

4. Did anyone close to you die?
My one Aunt passed away in January.   

5. What countries did you visit?
England!!!!  (And Iceland but I am not sure a 90 minute layover really counts)

6. What would you like to have in 2016 that you lacked in 2015?
Better insurance.  I could always use more money and sleep, but to be honest, I would like insurance I can USE.  (a 6k deductible means you basically pass on anything but all but basic care) 

7. What date from 2015 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
May 11th, finally got to see Highgate cemetery.  A bucket list item for 30 years.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
not killing anyone.

9. What was your biggest failure?
I can't save money for the life of me.  I should really get better at that.  Pretty sure the Spawn will want to go to college.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Gave myself a concussion falling out of bed while hitting the snooze alarm.  (that was a major hit to my pride, as well)

11. What was the best thing you bought?
a plane ticket.

12. Whose behaviour merited celebration?
My son.  He has come so far in voicing his emotions and frustrations... (granted, the trying to lie to me trend in the last few months is rather tedious)

13. Whose behaviour made you appalled and depressed?
America and everyone who supports stupidity and Donald Trump.  (to the rest of the world, I promise not ALL Americans are this ignorant.)

14. Where did most of your money go?
momentary shopping gratifaction

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
Going to England!!!!!

16. What song will always remind you of 2015?
Hmmmm..... I got on a My Chemical Romance kick this year.  Maybe ""Famous Last Words""

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
Happier or sadder? Happier, I think.  40 was a bad year, so it's certainly improved from that point.
Older or wiser? Older.  And Wiser.  I am the answer to everything, after all.
Richer or poorer? I can see the top of the hole...?

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Writing and reading.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Worrying.  But I do that a lot. 

20. How will you be spending Christmas?
Dashing to the mom's after opening presents here.

21. Did you fall in love in 2015?
I'm not a horribly romantic person, much to my husband's dismay.  I STILL love him, so that's a win.

22. How many one-night stands?
>.>    <.<    >.>
*cough cough cough broke the nightstand, lamp, candles, candle holder cough cough cough*

23. What was your favourite TV program?
I still love The Big Bang Theory.  I know many people take issue with it, but I laugh and look forward to it every week.  

24. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
Donald Trump

25. What was the best book you read?
The Forgotten Room by Lincoln Child.  Good science based mystery with just a hint of the supernatural.  

26. What was your greatest musical discovery?
George Ezra.

27. What did you want and get?
A vacation! 

28. What did you want and not get?
a newer car.  Ringo is on his last legs, I fear.

29. What was your favourite film of this year?
Crimson Peak!!! So.  Freaking.  GORGEOUS!!!!!!

30. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?
I turned 42.  I have decided to stop there, thank you very much.

31. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? 
More day trips.  I need more culture in my life.

32. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2015?
When I am ""dressing up"", retro.  40's-60's.

33. What kept you sane?
The fact that i look horrible in prison orange?  XD  

34. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?
Tom Hiddleston in Victorian clothing?  Gods yes please!!!!!!
Natalie Dormer

35. What political issue stirred you the most?
Gun control.  I keep thinking The Spawn should learn German so I can send him to college in Germany for less money and a lesser chance of being shot.

36. Who did you miss?
Melz, Siobhan, Becky, Frances, Angela, Mo, Lt, Meww.... all my Excolo peeps!  (I got to see Rachel but I still miss her too!)

37. Who was the best new person you met?
Kieran, who is wonderful!  Also... I wish I could remember his name.  While waiting for my Highgate tour, another American gentleman came up and remarked on my Poe T-shirt, and we found out not only did we share a lot of common interests... he grew up and lived in a town 20 minutes from where I was from in NJ.  Small world, huh?

38. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2015:
I am not a breakfast person.  don;t pay for the fancy English breakfast you will not eat enough of to make the price worth it. 

39. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:
""This hole you put me in 
wasn't deep enough 
and I'm climbing out right now""

Don't ask me why, this is the first thing that popped in."

"event","My hours have been cut (not just mine, everyones) and the yearly jump in my crap-tastic insurance is costing me ANOTHER 35.00 a paycheck.  And now The Husband is off for the summer.  (He drives school bus)  Now... he was told he could get unemployment for the summer, and it wasn't a lie....

just after being self-employed for three years (not turning a profit AT ALL) and only going back to a ""regular"" job last August, it seems he did not pay enough into unemployment and can't collect.  Whatever...

He'll be back at the ren faire in August, so we really just have to get through one month of no funds.  The problem was he thought he would be getting something of a bi-weekly check and had planned to buy into the ren faire business with what he made there starting august.  Now it will go to survival and we need to find the money to get through July and part of August AND come up w/ 3600.00 by the end of October.  He started a gofundme, and raised a 1/4 of it, but that was mostly from one very generous and unknown donor.  How does one get those to go viral, anyway?  Relentlessly gay yard lights can raise 9k in a day and potato salad....  but helping a vet raise 5k for a share of a business seems impossible.

I just sold some perfume to get groceries (child goes to day camp and has to take lunch every day and that is surprisingly not cheap) and gas and next weeks piano lesson. And I only need luch for three days next week and I can get by on ramen noodles and chef boyardee.

Just have to make it through one month.  With a husband who now is unable to support his smoking habit or his 6 pack of cola a day habit.  Who is now moping and surly and asking how much my LE NIN posters might go for.  (oh fuck no.)

It is late; very late.  Lucien said he would be back around midnight, one at the latest but it is now three am and Wanda cannot sleep for Lucien has not come back and it is never a good thing when he is out late.

Finally she gives up and heads down the stairs to find her coat and more importantly find her best friend in the world when the backdoor creaks open and Lucien stumbles in.  He looks a little dazed and won;t meet her eyes and in an instant she <i>knows</i>.  ""Where were you?""  She hisses quietly, fear building in her chest.  She ran almost five years ago because of a night just like this... what would the outcome be now.

""I... I.... Tez and I...""  Lucien still won't meet her eyes, just shakes his head and mumbles at his feet, and is not surprised when the flame haired woman strides forward and slaps him hard across the face.

""What did you <i>do</i>?""  She cries out, grabbing his shoulders and shaking him hard.  ""What did you give him???  What did he do to you---""  Only now she notices the limp, lanky thing clutched in his hand.

""What in gods name is <i>that</i>?""

""I... I... I think I traded my soul for... for this....""

Wanda is no longer listening to the babbling of her friend and sometimes lover, she is listening to the sound of hysterical laughter just north of town, so amused he cannot hide it from her.  Wanda says nothing, just shrugs into her trench coat angrily and swipes the red and black monstrosity from his hands before stomping towards the door.

""Wanda!  What are you doing?""

""Going to go tell Lucifer exactly what he can do with this sock monkey.""  She mutters and slams the door behind her so hard the windows rattle."

"event","Many, MANY years ago, back when I was in college... I had a now ex drop a friend on my couch.  A friend who stayed on my couch, illegally in the country, mind you, for three months.  I am now glad I can call said illegal (at the time) refugee from England a friend.  One who finally went back to England after several years here, one that I haven't seen in.... oh, six seven years.

So after much pleading and reminding that he owed me a couch to sleep on and a ride to the airport, I cancelled my last two nights reservations and agreed to go from Rachel's house in Birmingham to his in Colchester.  No big deal, I thought....

until I realized what would now be involved in getting TO London (Highgate specifically.  The place I have wanted to visit for 30 years and have a timed tour to) on that Monday.  I won't miss out hanging with him because he'll be at work, but it's going to be about three hours round trip by train and between 60-70 pounds to take the train there and back.  Whereas the hotel I chose was at a tube station that specifically went right to that area.

*grumbles*

I am not mad, please don't think that.  Monday night we'll hang out and get properly pissed, and the next day I won't have to worry about taking the wrong train or missing the right one to Gatwick.  So trading a fear for an annoyance I suppose is good.  

Just.... It's two weeks out and changing plans on this scale makes me buggy.  After I spent three days researching hotels."

And opted for the single room sans breakfast.  For the time I'll be there.... well, I chose it because it was near a rail station.  Hopefully will make getting to both Highgate and Gatwick easier.

I got five days.

Right now there is not a heating pad big enough for my leg.  I can't even pinpoint the center of the ache anymore... SO MUCH HURTS.  Which is leading me to believe there is a bigger problem than just a wonky muscle or bursa.  I go back next week, but I may end up calling and seeing if I can't be seen sooner than Thursday.

But now I am afraid.  Afraid there is a real problem.  Two of my friends keep bringing up blood clots.  The next step is a MRI (aka metal coffin, another issue in itself).  That should pinpoint any major problems.... but if there's a major problem, I am out of time.  27 days.  I started this at the beginning of March so I would not have any issues with my trip.  By the time I see the Dr. again, it will be 20 days.  By the time the MRI gets done... ?  

I am really upset.  I can't even think about my trip (in 27 days) because now I am too afraid to get excited for it.

I also found a fashionable long vest, a designer Grateful Dead Scarf (grey and black with the rose adorned skull printed on it) a pair of ridiculously gorgeous Rock and Republic high heels (On sale!  I swear!) a magazine, a pair of skimmy thingies to wear under dresses, two bars of soap from the little boutique in town, a selfie sticy (insert groan here) and FIVE bath bombs from LUSH...

I seriously cannot buy another thing until I dive into my closet and figure out what I have and what I am taking. 

I was kinda bad this weekend.  Wish I could feel worse about it.  Still waiting on my dress to arrive from Lady V London (been in a town only a hour away since the 17th according to tracking... weird) and a bra from BraStop.

Having sinus and tooth issues... I think.  Can't tell today where the pain in radiating from,  MiL has a fire BLAZING in here so the room is really dry, so my head hurts from that... but if I have a toothache, it seems to come from a tooth with a crown... and that can't bode well.  Taking sudafed seems to help so I think its a sinus issue... but the tooth still hurts after the headache abates.  Blurgh.

Dentist Thursday, ortho next week.  I would REALLY like to know whats up with my leg.  Hip doesn't hurt nearly as much, but there is still discomfort and my thigh hurts.  WTF body... coming up on 42 means we are the answer to everything in the universe, not that I need to start falling apart!!!!"

Guess I should also find a suitcase to borrow too, so he doesn't have puppies to go w/ said kittens.

(One black, one blue) I want a pair of ""skinny jeans"", but not sure if I can pull off that look. I have a cute hedgehog top, and I'll probably take some plain coloured t's... should look into a neutral cardigan or wrap top that can go with said tops?  What I really need are flattering tops.  
 
And a rain coat.  A stylish one.  I have a raincoat, but it's very steampunk/Firefry-esque, so thats a no go.  I want a colourful one that sets off my figure.  The one I was bidding on slipped away.  There's a gorgeous purple one on eBay, but it's a large and I don't know how that will fix my arms.  

And comfortable black flats.  I cannot seem to find a pair.  I have my floral boots, and they match a lot, so they will probably go, but I need COMFORTABLE and functional, that are not Crocs.  

I also need to figure out if the laptop is going or not.  I kinda don't want the hassle, but it's how I can stay in touch easily w/ Riley and Mom.  I am more afraid if I take it, it will give me a excuse to NOT go out on my own.

"event","Squeaky swings and tall grass
The longest shadows ever cast
The water's warm and children swim
And we frolicked about in our summer skin

I don't recall a single care
Just greenery and humid air
Then Labor day came and went
And we shed what was left of our summer skin

On the night you left I came over
And we peeled the freckles from our shoulders
Our brand new coats so flushed and pink
And I knew your heart I couldn't win
Cause the season's change was a conduit
And we'd left our love in our summer skin
~dcfc

absolutely amazing lyrics. reminds me of one the best movie-like moments of my life."

My doctor's have no CLUE what to do. 
It's not my blood sugar, a tumor, mono, B12 deficiency, high blood pressure, or my meds. We've tested it all. I'm on a low dose of anti-seizure medication and it IS NOT WORKING. I had another one while I was at work, as in WORKING WITH CHILDREN. Thank God none of them saw, because they were at art.

Barack Obama is the next President of the United States of America. 
He's a Liberal, and he's BLACK (collective gasp), and his father was MUSLIM(another, deeper gasp).
AND.....

I could not be more proud of the USA. 

For everyone that is all ""F&*K this, I'm moving to Canada!"", let me be the first to say don't let the metaphoric door between this country and the next hit your sorry, ignorant ass on the way out.

PUT UP OR SHUT UP people. The time for change has come. Embrace the new government. Get on with your life. Obama is not going to legalize crack or knock out ""Joe the Plumber"" or rap the National Anthem or start a new war...so chill the eff out man. Just because he's black doesn't mean the world will end. 

It makes me sad to see so much hate in this world."

"event","You know, it's true that I live in a small, southern, mostly white town in the Bible Belt of America, but it still doesn't make up for the sheer ignorance I see from time to time. Allow me to vent/rant on a few political issues::::

1) I voted last Wednesday. It was EXTREMELY busy, and yet, I saw MAYBE 2 young people (ie under, like 40) voting. Do we REALLY want some old farts to decide who runs our freaking country for the next 4 years!?!?! COME ON PEOPLE!!! Get WITH IT!  

2) At the elementary school I work at, I overheard one of my children saying ""Obama will never win because he's black and someone will shoot him!""
True, this is coming from the mouth of a 9 year old, but honestly, WHERE THE HELL do you think he picked this up from?!!?!?! You know good and well his racist parents are at home putting those ideas in his head, and he is too impressionable to reason things out otherwise.

3) I enjoy a good debate, I really do. If you want to battle with me over politics or my beliefs on something, if it is APPROPRIATE, I will go! But how DARE someone tell me I'm WRONG for what I believe. I would NEVER personally attack someone because they share a different opinion than me. Those that know me know I am a  bleeding hearted hippie liberal, and GUESS WHAT????? I don't lose any sleep over the fact that the man I voted for doesn't share the same skin color or exactly the same religious views as me. So when someone comes at me and tells me I'm wrong, that I should rethink the lifestyle I'm living, well screw you buddy. I would never say such a thing to another person. But then again, that's just the hippie in me.

If you read all this, you rock. Comments, anyone???"

You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream

You took my hand and danced with me

To walk right in and out of my life?

Spent New Year's Eve with the fam and Court, just like last year. We'd been watching the Law and Order: SVU marathon all day....it's tradtion now :) 
We got BWW (veggie burger for me, I'm addicted to them) and I made Vegan Cookies for everyone (and surprisingly even daddy, king of sweets, ate them) and we watched ""Lady in the Water"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"", and ""Accepted"". We watched the ball drop and made about 50 Ryan Seacrest jokes lol
I hope this year turns out to be as good as the last. I cannot believe my baby sister graduates from high school in a few months....and I turn 20. I feel so old :(

I can't believe either how much has happened in 1 year.. I've changed so much. I've lost and gained some friends...gotten closer to some and drifted away from others. Things happened that would have never even crossed my mind 2 years ago.
I've finally learned to appreciate the little things at home I took for granted before. I love my small town, the boringness and hickishness of it. The way that I can go anywhere in Stedman and I run into people...hows ECU hows your mom your dad  has stacey graduated yet?...I love my animals and my accent (which has gotten SOOO much stronger since ive been here, ps) I love that we have 1 stop light and the biggest attraction in town is the Andys. I love my entire family and how they drive me crazy and yet I love them more than anything. I love my parents and what they sacrifice for us, and how they give me hope for love b/c they truly are soulmates. I love my sister and how she understands me more than anyone, and I don't have to say a word to her. I love that we beat the crap outta each other and still get along. We really are Chris and Mike from Just Friends... I love tennilley and how she gets me so well also. I love that things don't change so much here...everything is sort of gradual shifts. Stedman is full of constants. My room is always the same, my family, Tennille and Court are here, my animals, my house doesn't change....I think I need that.
Greenville is a different story. My life is crazy, constant change and utter chaos. I'm always on the go, never sleeping, eating cheap crappy food and taking the bus everywhere. No one knows me in Greenville...I feel so anonymous but I have a bigger base of friends....strange. I have Theatre which keeps me occupied...sometimes I feel like I can't slow down. I wouldn't change it though...
06 was a great year.

You know what? I'm madly in love with both of my lives."

We went and looked at State for my sister, got some delish coffee, walked around downtown and Fayettville Street, ate lunch at a place Christina talks about called Lilly's Pizza (MOUTHGASM OMFG), and went shopping.
I got 5 new tops, some Nollie perfume, jewlery, stuff for my apartment and a funny calender.

I've decided to sorta re-do my room at the apartment.... a little more mature.  Right now my theme is ""fire hazzard"".

NOTHING went right today. I swear. 

I woke up late, almost missed the bus, waited for 45 mins for my friend who never showed up, hauled ass to the shop to find out I had to wait til after 1to do my project( even though Reid gave me permission to come @ 11...wtf?!?!), raced back home to get all my teaching shit together, then the printer fucked up and I ended up having to e-mail Patch all of my shit, took an imcomplete b.c I didn't have my hours, came back home long enough to pay my rent and then ran out the door again to help set up for the gala in the shop (I owed Reid like 30 mins), haul ass AGAIN to get there just to come in and find the place spotless, so Reid says we'll call it even and I can just go home. 

I got into the car and just started screaming and crying to try and make myself feel better, but it didn't work. I went and bought a pack of Cloves and smoked like 4 in a row I swear to God, but that made me feel worse.

When I got home I litterally fell into bed and didn't wake up til now. And thank God I did, because I still have 4 papers to write for tomorrow, plus my presentation. Oh and did I mention Blackboard keeps freezing and bootin me off...and all of my information I need to write the papers is on there?

Oh and everyone else in the house is all excited about Christmas now, and all of thier presents are wrapped and stockings are decorated, but I can't even take a break long enough to do that...oh wait. I haven't even got thier damn presents yet. AND I can't really afford it, ya know?

<font size=""4"">Friday:</font size=""4"">
Observed in the schools early in the morning with Amy. Came back, sleptttttttt, and later that night went out. We went to IHOP and kidnapped Jay and Dan. It was so much fun. We came back and Paul and Jay and Stefan and some other drunk guys I didn't know came down. We hung out for a while, and then me and Heather decided to go play in the rain. We slid in the puddles and rolled down the hill and got dirrrrrrrty. hehe We had an audience for a while, which was rather embaressing, but they all assumed we were drunk (which we weren't). haha

My day didn't start til like 4, when I finally dragged my ass outta bed. We randomly found a cat on our porch (on the second floor...what the balls?!) So we cleaned her up well and found her a nice home with Carlton. I named her Moneen, after the band. She is SO cute and friendly! We had a mini photoshoot with her lol.

We had so much fun. Super Mario brothers marathons, card games, drinkin on almost everyone else's part, and wrestling. Yes, wrestling. Plus I met some kick ass people that I will def be hanging out with again.

We opened all the windows and the balcony door and lit fall scented candles and baked Pumpkin cookies and listened to Cartel and Jack Johnson.

I love my little apartment and my roommates :)

Tomorrow Stace is coming up and me her and Em are going to see Cartel at the Lincoln. I'm excited.
Plus Amber is coming down from App...I miss her so much!

On another note, today was good, but I don't feel satisfied. I just don't like Greenville. I want to be somewhere with more scenery than a McDonalds on every corner. I want to be in the mountains or at the beach. 

I'm sorta considering transferring to App. Boone is so close to the mountians that I love so much. But at the same time, I love ECU the school, and that's what I'm really here for.
I don't know. Emily made a good point when she said that since Stace is 99.9999% sure she's going there, I can just visit.

Eh. I just don't know anymore."

I have an awesome Makeup class that I look forward to, and Crew, which is where we paint the set for Chicago. My schedule is hectic, but I'm gettin through ok for now. I rarely see my friends during the week though, so this is a big boo. Every week we have a dinner party with Kristina and Arman and Megan and Christina. We take turns cooking and hosting...its actually alot of fun.
 
This weekend will consist of: 
<center> Artsmarts for the kids Friday morning
Micah's Drag show Saturday
Dinner party with the usual suspects at our place
and of course.......PARTYING!</center>

Next week I'm going to see Cartel @ the Lincoln with my sister and Em and Heather. Then the 27th I'm going to see Tilly and the Wall @ Cat's Cradle...um can we say EXCITED?!?!

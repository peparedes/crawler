"event","<p>For those of you hat don't know, we had a puppy for about 2 weeks two weeks ago and took him back to the shelter. It was a no kill sheler and he was 4 months old, so i'm sure he has already been adopted by now. He was such a handful. We live in an apartment and it wasn't far because he was cooped up in his crate a lot during the day. I came home and let him out a lot, but I always felt guilty...like I wasn't doing enough. I feel worse because he was so smart. He learned quickly how to sleep through the night and how to not go in the house. Problem was, I was taking him out like 20 times a day.&nbsp;<br />often i think i was the right choice for everyone. David was miserable and stressed out just coming home. I was always running around, trying to make sure the puppy got let out enough, got enough attention...etc...while balancing my internship and schoolwork. David and I had no time for each other. We couldn' get through a 30 minute tv show because the puppy was always needing something. Not having a backyard is terrible.&nbsp;<br />But other times, i feel so horrible about it. School is ending in a month, and if I had waited...I would finally have enough time for the puppy. He was such a quick learner, things might have gotten better if we gave it more time. We jus had no idea how hard it would be in an apartment to make it work, especially because we are not the type to just crate the dog all the time. I sometimes wish we had given it more time, though I know that would have made it harder if we decided to take him back...plus we wanted to give him back while he was still young enough to be appealing to families.&nbsp;<br />it still hurts, I really loved him. I'm sure the timing was wrong, i just wish I was 100% certain it wouldn't have gotten better.<br />I hate feeling sad.</p>"

"event","<p>So here's my situation. For my degree program, I need to do an internship. I have three that I got replies from (not a paid internship, btw...volunteer) One is this county soil and conservation education program, the second is an organization that raises money for head start and early education programs, and the third is United Way.<br /><br />I met with the environmental one and LOVED the lady i'd be working with. Pros: Everything is casual. Pretty lax schedule except for planned events. VERY nice people. A cause I believe in.<br />Cons: Outside of actual events where we are working with the public, i'm just going to be playing it by ear....she'll be finding me stuff to do. I feel nervous since it's not super structured I won't reach my 100 hour requirement. I'm bothered because she kind of pushed me into acepting before I got to explore my other two options.<br /><br />The second one sent me a proposal online and it seems like i might learn more from them. Seems a bit for structured. Another cool cause where I'd get to work with kids. I'm worried bec ause I haven't met them in person so I don't know how strict and demanding its going to be.&nbsp;<br /><br />The third, I have an appointment on Tuesday for and have no idea how it's gonna go.<br /><br />The question is: If i decide one of the other two option is better for me, is it wrong to pull out on the environmental thing? I would tell her that I've found something that will more meet my course requirements, but that I would still like to commit to helping with some of the events.&nbsp; I feel bad that I already accepted...she kind of just start telling people I was volunteering there before I'd said I was when I was in the office...but it's not like i'd be leaving her completely high and dry.<br /><br />Tell me what you guys think....this whole thing is kind of stressing me out. Thank you!</p>"

All those middle school feelings of ""what does she think of me? Should I ask if they wanna hang out?"" I hate it. I can't wait until it's a few months from now and I've settled in more. It doesn't help that I hate the classes i'm taking right now. They are going fine, don't get me wrong, but there are just some gen ed courses that i'm tired of wasting my life with. I'm hoping to come home in December and visit, but it's scary too. I'm nervous about being pulled in a bunch of different directions and never really spending enough time with anyone.

I know I did really well, got an A...but I dont feel very proud. Because the majority of the class had failed the last two { I got Ds.} the prof. gave us a study guide. it had forty of the fifty questions on it, we just had to find the answers. So, i found em and I memorized em plus I looked up the words to make sure I understood em and reviewed my lecture notes {the last ten were from lectures} So, of course I did well, it was super easy to get the right answers. But, I can't really feel proud of the grade, ya know? Everyone I have said that to thinks i'm lame...but I like working for good grades. Easy As make me feel bad. 
My tummy feels yucky...I feel all around blah. Dont wanna work in two hours, but I feel bad calling in. Plus, money would be nice.

So, lots of drama tonight. 
I was sitting in my room talking on the phone to my friend. On the phone I said something inappropriate {told a not nice joke} anyway, my suitmate came in, said she overheard me, and flipped out on me cussing a storm! So, i went back into her room and apologized for offending her but said she had no right to come into my room and talk shit. She told me I have horrible character and I'm shit and blah blh blah....went fucking crazy. Now i'm going home this weekend and I dont feel safe about my stuff because we share a bahtroom and she has access to my room at all tiems. I spoke to an RA and the only thing I can do to guarantee safety {and not punch her face in} is to move out. So...i spent the past two hours packing and I move my shit somewhere { i dunno where yet or with whom} at 8 am tomorrow.
I was supposed to have a midterm tomorrow but I emailed the teacher to tell him the situation. I'm gonna go see him tomorrow to make sure I can take a make up. IT will be a harder test, but it was all I could do.
I fucking hate girl drama...hate it. Tomorrow will be hell but then i'll be done with it.
Anyway, gotta do homework then crash. Please remind me that going through this hell makes you stronger..."

So, my boyfriend Robert came up to visit around 2:00 and just seeing him standing there was so nice. You don't realize how long a week really is until you're in a long distance relationship with someone you care about this much. We were neckin' in public like teenagers, it was great. :) {oh wait, i am a teenager}
Then we walked for awhile and found an ALL YOU CAN EAT indian restaurant with some bomb ass food. I love indian and it's his favorite, so we went crazy with the eating. It was pretty inexpensive too! 
After that we went and saw The Forty Year Old Virgin, which was fuckin' hilarious. I loved it. 
All too soon he had to go back to tucson...but seeing him was definitely what I needed to get through the week. Today was just so nice because we both felt so in love; playing with eachother, carrying me everywhere, joking around, kissing continuously, being mushy, eating good food. Anyway, it was great. I feel so happy.

This is my first weekend up in Tempe without going home. *gasp! SHOCK! AWWWE* Really, it hasn't been as bad as I anticipated. On friday afternoon I went up to Payson with my friend Jeanette and some of her friends for a camping trip with her church. Only we got horribly lost and didn't get there until 10:30 pm! But, there were cold burgers waiting and we sat around a campfire...it was ncie being out in the not so scorching weather. Saturday after breakfast we came back here and i did errands all day. Which include {but are not limited to} cleaning my room, orgaanizing my papers, doing laundry, and doing math homework. IT sucked, but atleast i felt accomplished.
This morning I woke up early and went to church for the first time in forever. Everyone at the Methodist church up here was super nice and the college group leader is even a social work major like me! I'm hoping to get involved in church stuff soon...it felt so good being back around normal people. Heh..
Now i'm sitting her anxiously waiting the arrival of my boyfriend! he's coming up to visit for the day and i'm super excited. No clue what we'll do, but ah well. I know we're going to lunch somewhere...yay.
Linden, i really miss you. When you were talking about childhoods in your last post it reminded me how much we went through growin' up......Me in first grade with my short lesbo hair...a very tramatic time for a young, undeveloped girl..atleast back then having your ears pierced meant you were female, nowadays you can't tell... :)

I'm PAYING for this ""experience""...which so far doesn't seem so awesome. {yes yes, i know, it'll get better...only been here a month...it takes time...i'll meet cool people eventually...yadda yadda} I'm just sayin, i think some of you pima people have the right idea; doing college for cheap. I dunno, realistically I'm not paying too much in comparison to other people in college. but damn! Just seems like if i'm paying for it, i should be enjoying it more. GAH..plus, i have to go on a 30 minute bus ride to the social security office, get another social security card, and then go fill out a huge new hire packet. Not having a car out here is pretty crippling. 
AND! Can i please just say something to all yall bitches? 
Remember when you saw a kid with choppy black hair, spikes, chucks, and a skateboard and it meant they probably listened to angry white people music? A la Mudvayne, Slipknot, etc? WELL! nowadays you see a kid like that and then have a MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE shirt on....or something else whiny. AHHH where are the bad asses? 
sorry if you IM me and I don't respond....i forget to put up my message a lot."

Now I have about an hour until my next class, and last class of the day; math. Believe it or not, I've totally stayed on top of my math assignments thus far. Considering how much I hate math, it's a little bit of a suprise.

All you computer geniuses out there, ATTENTION!! 
I have a new Dell, with windows XP. Well, outta no where it started acting up alot. When it loads after you turn it on, the chimey sound is all crackly and skippy. Then, when I play a CD with Windows MEdia, it always starts out all crackly and skippy.....then if I try to do something {like access email} is starts playing slow and crackly again. It's almost like i'm trying to do too many things at once, when i'm only doing super simple things. Any advice??

A week before today will be Robert and I's 3 month anniversary. {tee hee hee} I love him so much. We just got off the phone and, like always, we couldn't talk long at all { I hate his work schedule} But, before hanging up he madea point to tell me how important to him our relationship is and how sorry he is that this distance makes it difficult to feel as connected to each other as we usually are. Well, needless to say...he really put a smile on my face. 
So Murphy, I heard you met the boyfriend...how random is that? :)

Welp, i'm out. time for a shower since I have time. {yes, be proud, i went to my last class in PJ's and a santa rita drama t-shirt}"

Today has been a shitty day overall. SOmetimes I feel like ""hey ASU isn't so bad, I could grow to like it here"" Other times, like today, I feel like there is no one I can relate to. Talking about boys or listening to girls talking about getting drunk is only tolerable for so long. Everyone seems to come from money, those who don't pretend like they do. It's rush week at the sororities so the whole campus is a-buss. Gag me. It feels like in Tempe, it's a sea of lame-os and you have to search for the quality people. In tucson I think it was more cool people but you could definitely find the snobs if you wanted to. So....i just wish I could find more people to relate to...
It feels like there are a few people in every class that I dont mind talking to for an hour, but no one I would consider a friend. Well, except Jenette. she's probably the closest person to me of the new people i've met. :)
I have my first exam tomorrow....bleh. I dont feel too ready but I'll be ok...especially since he drops your lowest exam score. 
I had my dance class tonight.,..i missed last week so I had a lot of catching up. It's a lot of fun though, i think with practice I'll get pretty goood.
Anyway, I'm off. I need to go study."

It's not bad up here, actually. I've met a few really cool people that I now consider friends. Including my roomate! She's a really great girl..I don't think we'll be hanging out outside the room too often, but we sit around and chat often. Classes aren't terrible, but I really hate lectures and trying to prepare for tests. It's kind of hard to gauge how prepared you are. {though I know I'm not as prepared as I Should be}
I need to find a job. I tried for a theatre job but didn't hear anything back so I think i'm just gonna put in as many application at other places as possible. Since it's a three day weekend, i'm gonna be home. I know i'll be busy, but I'd really love to hang out with you guys so hit me up!
What else? I miss my boyfriend, a lot. It's hard to feel connected with this distance at times. {Though I know alot of people have made it work with ALOT more distance, so i'm thankful ours is only an hour and a half.} Aside from missing all the people I love, I think i'm adjusting well to Tempe. But....no plantinum hair yet, I must not QUITE fit in. :)"

College is nothing like I expected..well, i guess it is...it just seems stupid that teachers in High school ran things in one way.. and BAM! now in college it's just read the text, come to lectures, and take tests. that's it. I feel like {atleast in my intro classes} I could just buy books and teach myself. I guess gen eds just suck, it gets better though right guys? 
BUT! I AM SELF SUFFICIENT! I did my own laundry yesterday { a special moment, the first college laundry trip} AND! I hunted all over campus till someone would help me fix my computer, they told me what to do...and now it's all fixed!! ASU's ethernet system is wicked fast and awesome, but also a bitch.
i feel very stressed out, lots of stuff to do ALL THE TIME. I miss everyone alot too...
Robert and I are having a tough time with the distance right now. it's tough having a girlfriend far away wwith a biggillion guys, and i understand that. I just know how faithful and dedicated I am to him and I can't wait until there isn't this adjustment and tension anymore. I love him so much.

I'm almost unpacked...i've kinda been procrastinating on putting the clothes away...But, the computer is up and so is the tv and fridge {lord knows the food better be there for me at all times!]
Moving in yesterday was very tough for me...I cried a lot. Partly because I only got 2 hours of sleep and we all know how emotional that can make people. Also because i'm PMSing...Mostly because I'm REALLY missing my family, boyfriend, and friends..I know I'm gonna make more friends...my roomate is a really sweet girl and I get along with my suitemates, but I still feel alittle lonely. Rich and Amanda have been spending a good amount of time with me which I really appreciate. Mostly I've been focusing on getting all my stuff settled for classes on monday;I think once classes start and i'm more involved, I won't feel as lonely. I'm just not a big fan of getting all dressed up and going to mixers and BBQs all weekend.
BUT!!! I Am excited because I'm looking for my work study job and I spoke to a guy in the theatre department, appearantly they are hiring students to work as techies for the year! So, we talked shop for awhile and he even spoke to me about auditioning for the upcoming show. I think i'm gonna do it...not cuz i'll get cast, but atleast for the experience.
So...thats all for now. I miss you all so much! please comment...."

I fucking hate ASU FINANCIAL AID DEPARTMENT! Fucking sluts......I got a scholarship, they FINALLY processed it, and then they reduced the loan I was counting on by the amouint of the scholarship instead of just taking away the loan i didn't accept!! So now they want me to pay 6% on a 290.00 loan, fuck that. I dont need that dirty money. SO i've spent the past 20 minutes wasting my cell phone's minutes trying to call them and cancel the loan, but it keeps saying ""due to an abnormally high volume of calls, we ask you to try again later."" Thats probably just because they are fucking everyone else over too!! GEEESH! I'm so frustrated....Looks like i'm DEFINITELY Gonna be a poor bitch ramen noodling it in college....*shrug* good thing i'm not accustomed to a Gucci lifestyle anyway...
THings are good, as i've said...i've been going back to taekwondo and it has made me so happy! I'm glad to see my body still functions, all things considered. I can't wait to start practicing up in Tempe. I'm with Robert, who made me insanely happy. We've decided to stay together while I'm up at school. I get nervous cuz we all know long distance sucks, but I trust him and I definitely think it's worth the effort.

Well, i Just finished this SUPER ASS tutorial for my student loan. I hate when they require you to do retarded, kindergarden {read the passage then answer the multiple choice questions below} shit. But it's done...And this loan is cool because if you work in public programs, they do loan forgiveness over time. I guess it's cuz they realize we won't make enough money as social workers to pay their asses back. 
I move in about 3 weeks, scary shit. I'm nervous, but definitely getting excited. I can't believe after 13 years in Tucson, I have to try to consider some room with a stranger in it as ""home"". BUT! if anyone goes up to Tempe, I'll have maybe 6 inches of bedprace and maybe a little floorspace for ya!

Reason 1; My computer is a dumb slut bag whore!

I only get access to a computer over at robert's or at carrie's.....so usually I don't go buck wild with the urge to update.
I get sad when i read everyone's updates...seems like everyone is upset about something. *i guess this is growing up....duh na na na....duh na na na* I just quoted BLink 182 in an entry, please have me assassinated.
Things are pretty much same ol'. I move to tempe in less than a month now..i'm pretty nervous about it. definitely excited though. it's gonna be hard leaving my life here behind, but I think it's a good thing to try. We shall see. My schedule has been kind of hectic and is....as follows...
mon-thurs I work 12- 5 pm....then a couple days a week I have taekwondo usually around 7 o'clock {thats right, sports fans, i'm back in taekwondo! Ive taken 3 classes so far and i'm having a really good time...hooray} usually around 10 or 11 pm i see robert...then i sleep. Somewhere in there I hang out with Carrie and cause lots of mischief...dang Rebels. Like Scott. Tee Hee BUT! I can be persuaded to hang out, so definitely hit me up.

I started a job at my aunt's lawfirm on wednesday. It's just clerk type stuff, but it's easy and everyone is super sweet. If I can't get this other job I REALLY WANT AND WOULD BE PERFECT FOR, i'm gonna stay there this summer. 

Adam Griggs is having a pity party today- it's understandable, but it makes me sad since i can't do anything to comfort him. SMILE ADAM!! You're my favorite...

Right now i'm housesitting again for my friend Mark. getting paid to hang out with his dogs and watch tv, my kind of job. I'm there till sunday if anyone wants to chill and watch movies. 

I'm super excited for the choir banquet tonight. For one, no one has to pay to get in {amen!} and for two, the theme is choir prom so I get to dress up. SWEEEEET. Saturday is the drama awards night, which is always alot of fun. I'm singing Zepplin's ""Whole Lotta Love"" with my friend's pat, david, and tony...it's gonna kick ass! I WANNA ROCK {ROCK}/////

Oh! and sunday i'm getting confirmed in church as well as rebaptized. I'm excited...i'm gonna go buy a dress today. I'm really pelased because I know this is something important that i've wanted to do forever. I've finally found a church where I belong..amen!

Congrats to Ruthie on everything good that's happening in her life. Oh and philip, i can't wait to see you for my graduation! SHERBERT!!!! {please note, my bestest guy friend in the world is coming home for my graduation.}

I have senior pics, finally. Randi and I are really proud of them. I need to send out invites to everyone...so comment and tell me you want one {or atleast the sexy pic...rarrr.} That includes you Brent, I need to send you your invite. :)

I love double spacing...PS

AND CARRIE! I Watched Dawson's creek this morning and thought of you. We're roadtripping this sumer, eh? and adam's coming? Sounds like a plan to me!

"event","Prom was a lot of fun...i'm nto QUITE in the mood to do the huge prom post yet...but i'll get to it. promise. Lots of fiascos trying to get ready but it ended up working out really welll. Alex wass a wonderful date, though I missed Brent something fierce. I danced like none other, Carrie, so be proud! Everyone was bitching about the music, but the cool people made the best of it. {ha, i threw myself into the cool catagorie.....hell mustve frozen over.}

What else? if you';ve called me and gotten a busy signal, it's cuz QWEST is a big bunch of whores that didn't show up to repaire the phone line when they said they would. I SAT AROUND ALL DAY FOR NOTHING! anger.....
should be fixed when i get home, but who knows.

Senioritis is a bitch..i just wanna graduate.
OH! and it's official...barring any disasters...i'm going to ASU in the fall. They offered me better financial aid than the UofA, and i'm a biotch that goes where the money is. everyone will have to come up and party with me...cuz i love to party.....party animal Jess..woo woo woo...

Im off..comment if ya love me...or if u wanna tell me whata dorkus I am.

Oh Oh! this morning I went to Carson to talk up the drama program. well, it was supposed to be just drama but since no one showed up I ended up representing the entire fine arts department. Alot of the kids were lame, but I enjoyed a few. One set of obviously drama-fied girls raised their hands and asked where I got my raindrop covered clogs to which I replyed {PAYLESS!! 4 bucks!} it made me grin..."

"event","So, I dont post enough. I'm sorry. 

Here's what i've been doing.
I went up to Phoenix this weekend, had a wonderful time. Brent made me samitches and dinner when I stayed over..it's really nice just being home-bodies {is that the word for it?} together. On saturday we spent the whole day at his parents house. He has the cutest little sisters in the world...I spend most of the afternoon with them. Drawing pictures, swimming, chit chatting...it was nice. THen all of us watched Finding Neverland {frickin' awesome movie for those of you that've never seen it.} I cried...go figure. 
The more serious we get, the harder it is to leave him {i suppose thats the natural progression of things, eh?} Especially cuz I know we won't see eachother again until KFMA DAY next month...thats like 3 weeks away! I'll be nearly graduated by then....

I went today to get lots of my prom stuff together. it took FOREVER but I got some heels and my jewelry. My dress is now with my friend KAtie and her mommy is gonna hem it cuz i'm short even with the heels on. Having most of my stuff together is definitely a weight off my shoulders...

What else? UofA has been dicking with my financial aid!~ SKDLjkgjhlkjhr! I'm so annoyed..so i'm being patient, waiting to see what they have to offer before I commit to ASU. being stuck in limbo sucks...

****Philip! I dunno if you read this, but if so..are you coming for graduation? Last time we talked it was a GO, but it has been a couple weeks. I really hope so! 


Welp, i better stop procrastinating and get to writing this play for Bridge Builders...wish me luck that it doesn't suck. Or rhyme, all the time. Whoa, being this cool should be a crime! Muhaha..."

Courtnie and I bonded some and we got some people to do an exercise video.

Whats been going on? Well...I house sat all weekend, lots of frickin' fun. Got paid pretty well too. Took my boyfriend on a hot date to see Sin City, which was really cool. I loved the artistic cinematography, it was awesome. Plus, the company wasn't bad. :)
School is going well, can't believe we're almost done. I really need to get the ball rolling on all this college stuff...*sigh*

The shows in advanced drama have been going great!! I saw Lo and Behold, which was super cute and funny...it's thursday, 7 pm for anyone interested. Our show, The Cemetary Club, was tonight and it kicked ass! {much to our collective suprise.} In the show we all play Queen's style jewish old ladies. need I say more? :)
The audience was really supportive and it was ALOT OF FUN!! If you get a chance, check it out friday night at 7.....it's the last show of my high school career....PLEASE COME!!! ask me if you have any questions...."

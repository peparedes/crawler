Tomorrow I will too.
I know that I am not near,
To hold you when your blue.

I wish I could spend every second,
Chasing away the clouds,
bring the sunshine to you,
Just to make you smile.

I have done many things,
Pulled your heartstrings,
Kept you in the dark,
Not telling of things in my past.

We could have walked away,
But we know that tomorrow is better,
Just like the day we danced in the rain,
The sunshine came in the morning.

Yesterday, Today, and still to come,
That is when I will love you,
Ups and downs,
And through all the tough times.

Today I'm far away,
Tomorrow I wont be closer
Soon I will hold you,
Soon I will be home."

holding my phone,
listening to the voice I love the most,
the tears run down my face

Ive hurt the one I love,
Said things that can't be taken back,
I need to fight,
I need to make things right

Days of past so dearly needed,
The ones that our hearts long for,
When we had no cares,
We were living our dreams

My heart cries out,
for the one I love,
She has my heart,
Till the day I die,
No other person,
could fill my heart like her

Ive hurt the one I love,
Said things that can't be taken back,

I need to fight,
I need to, I must,
I have no other choice,
I need to fight for the love of my life

The one I love, 
Everytime I thank God, 
For putting her in my life, 
I pray that the moment would never pass 

I asked for an angel, and I got one, 
Everytime she jumps to see me, 
Everything that she says, 
Every moment spent together, 
I see the love that she has for me 

She is the girl I long to see, 
The one that I show off to my friends, 
I would give all the things I have, 
Just to be with her another moment 

She isnt perfect,&nbsp; 
but neither am I, 
I love her and thats all that it takes, 
Through the tears, laughter, struggles, and smiles, 
My love for her grows, 

It took sometime for me to see, 
The one who is right for me, 
Showing me the love, 
That makes me love her, 
""More than Happiness"" 



Cassie, you are everything Ive prayed for."

Letting it sting my tounge, 
My mind is in a state,

I fight it trying to be the one I want, 
Coldness takes over, 
And I my mind leaves, 
Im left with all the safe of anger, 
Only its open and i have no control. 

Her&nbsp;memories still in my head, 
The music gets louder, 
Fists start to clentch, 
Walk away from the group, 
The people who I thought had my back have turned, 
I have only a few still standing with me.

My eyelids are the flood gates.
I walked into a lost memory,
The ones for so long had comforted me.
This world has ways of twisting the minds thoughts.

Climbing to the next rung,
It takes everything my arms have.
Times that we had left down 6 feet.
I grab a hold of the next thing I see.
Just so happens to be a helping hand.

I fight back saying what I really want to say,
Words that have been pent up for a long time.
Ever since the fade,
the one day it all ended came closer.

The lights go down, the crowd leaves,
Its just you and me, no one else
Do you talk or do you walk
Your eyes say everything you think

I see in you eyes,&nbsp;
I see a fire,
not the one of old,
a new one, a cold icy fire.
One that wants to drive a stake into my back.

Its up to you
But its between you and me,
leave others out,
or the game's on"

"event","Well just got from the Disciple concert. There was only one disappointment, FF5 was double booked and couldn't make. The rest of the concert was GREAT. The pit was small, but then the venue was too. I will never go to pantagous unless it is a band that I really, REALLY like. Decyfer Down and Fireflight were good. The pit was pretty tame. Then Disciple came on stage, within the pit was crazy. I was right against the guard rail. And this is where the name comes from. Well, as most of you know, the guard rail is suppose to keep the fans at a distance that they can't the performers. Well as Winnipeggers, and CANADIANS we got crazy and broke it. This meant that the old orchestra pit was used. I am proud to say that I was one of the crazy fans that help break it by leaning on it. The lead sing of Disciple is awesome, and he loves his fans. Making sure that no one got hurt, but letting us get wild. At the end of the show me and Steve were still standing in the front, and the drummer through his stick towards up. Then we went to BK. On the way home, Courtney went crazy because I was drumming with the stick in one hand and then with hers in the other. Now my ears are ringing, voice is failing, and I have bruises on my hip, ribs, elbow, leg, and cuts on my elbow and hip. This was the first time Disciple came to Winnipeg and Canada, and they said that we are so much more crazier(I know its not a word, but that is how I want it) then the fans down in the states, and most places they have played. Courtney got my Valentine's Day Gift, we are not keeping them secret this year. I can't wait to be able to wear it on the 14th. At least I have my hat and shirt. Well I gotta jet and get some sleep.

What is up my friends.  So life is starting to pick up in my last year of High School.  Looking back it at my time at TCI I have changed so much.  Thanks to all my friends who brought me out of my shell.  Coming into a school not knowing many people and 3 years later I have a great group of friends that love me.  These are the best days of our life, lets not waste them with worrying about next year and the rest of our lives.  Tomorrow comes when it does.  The moment lasts for a second.  For those who have moved.  You are still loved and welcomed back at any moment.  Last point, Memories will be all you have to show for your life before grad, make sure that you have abundance so that you never forget these times we have together.

"event","Hey,

Well, its been a year.  Life has changed,I have changed, and the world has changed.  I remember praying to God about what to do.  Wait or ask her out.  Thanks for the direction God.  Things just seem to fall into place.  I was nervous, didn't know if she was going to say yes or no.  Now a year later, I think that if I didnt ask, I probably would be a totally different person.  We have overcome struggles, and fights along the way.  We have faced up to each other when something was troubling us.  And for the first time in my life, I have missed someone, even before I left them.  This is truly a gift from God.  This past summer, even with all the things that I did when you were gone, I had thought about you all the time.  When I was down, you knew how to cheer me up, even if it was only for a few minutes.  I don't know what I would do with out you.  Courtney, you are the love of my life.  I want everyone to know that.  Life without you wouldn't be life.  I have never been so close to someone before.  I have shared all my secerts with you, I have even let you know my fears.  I love you."

Im only their for an hour.  so im not gonna complain much.  TFK, SWEET.  I cant wait till the concert.  I dont think i can count on both hands and feet how many times i have seen them in concert.  I cant wait to get the car back later this week.  Dont have to walk in the cold anymore.  I wrote last year on msnspace, that a lot can change in a year.  That still stands true.  Big changes lay in front of us, how we face them is the way we are shaped to who we are suppose to be.  Thank God for everything that you have.  You could have nothing. Keep your friends close to you. Live Life, Have Fun, PEACE OUT

"event","Well, just when you think all the tears are gone and there is more to come.  Grant will be missed, he tought me much.  He was one of those people who no matter how long you knew him, he made you feel like you were he best friend.  I dont know why God took him at the time he did, but in the end He knows best.  We can die at any moment, please don't wait, you may not have a chance to make things right with God.  I don't want to see one of my friends die and go to hell.  We are mortal and may not be here tomorrow.  Well I'm off for now.

God Bless,

"event","I am crazy, I have views that are radical, that go against everything and anything that is considered politically correct.  I think a great nation, like ours that started off as one that had the ONE, TRUE GOD as it center has wondered from it and has a lower set of morales.  Crazy because I wear my faith on my sleeve so all can see, no matter what people will say about me.  I can say that there is one way to complete happiness, and that there will never be complete peace in my life, but I can have peace in myself.  I believe in the commonly unknow, the thing I can't see, The thing I can feel, the one thing that brings me peace.  I will never let this go.  My God created me to be radical, to oppose the wrong, hate evil, and bring glory to God and God only.  That is my call, I will fight for my cause even if it brings me death.  My Faith is my life, science can try to prove me wrong, but they will lose in the end.  This has all been planned out.  Read the Great Book and you will find out that this not just a weird plan in my head.  I will not let this world become my home,  Im here for a short time only.  Death bring it on, you don't scare me I have the One on my side that conqured any power.  God give me the strenght I need to get through all the taunted and temptations that will face.  Amen.  

Peace Out, Dan Van"

"event","Today truely was not going to well for me!! Oh my god, I almost ran my arm into the fucking wall, or maybe someone's head!!  This is how it all started..
Well first off, Jessica Richards is telling Alycia Kelly all this fucking shit I NEVER said!! Like for instance.. ""She said that you ""suck"" at snowboarding,"" and also ""Chelsea said that you should be intimidated by her!!"" What the fuck you asshole!! One thing is I said that she sucked at snowboarding AT FIRST!! And also I said that she wasn't intimidated by me, I NEVER said that she should be!  Get your fucking facts straight bitch!!  That is what sent me off a couple days ago.. Now this was the situation today..

Well, towards the morning I was rather calm until I found out something.....
I am not going to go there because I will get someone in trouble, but when I heard that I fucking slammed my fist on the fucking lunch table and screamed mother fucker, and frickin' Keebler, Travis, and Justin M. looked at me in horror! They said that they were not going to screw around with me than..  I was PISTED!! I was shaking sooooo terribly! I couldn't even get the food on my fork without is all falling off!!  I was restraining myself the whole damn time trying not to throw my whole damn tray fucking at that little fucking bitch..!  And one time I had my applesauce ready to fucking toss it at her, but Matt calmed me down beforehand...he kind of wanted to see it though..lol on his behave...

Oh my gosh, when sooo many people asked me what was a matter and I told them the situation I couldn't believe how many people that were not fond of her...hey guess I am not the only one...

So next time you go fucking telling someone something FUCKING GET THE STRAIGHT TRUTH YOU ASS!!!  Hmmm..I wonder what fucking else you fucking told frickin' other people...

People to let you know I did not start this!!  Why the hell would I want this shti to happen...

She started it by telling those untrue assumptions about Alycia...
  ^HA! Now because of this situation she hates me..

THAT MOFO!!!!!!"

"event","Wow, this day has been quite...hactic.  I started the day out just right! I slept in and missed the bus. When my dad was driving us to school he gave us quite a mouthful about how this is sooo inconvenient for him and that we need to get up a lot more earlier for future reference. Ugh, that is going to be heck because I already have a problem getting up already. 
   When I got to school normal, boring, aggravating routine. I walk up the pointless flights of stairs to get to my locker, were I see all the damn preps around blocking my entrance, so eventually I busted my way through that unwanted crowd gossiping about anything thing that they can lay there hands on. After  finishing up with my locker I walk a matter of five feet and then frickin' Corey C. runs right into me because of the fact that Matt R. pushed him so I just called them assholes and walked away. Soooo damn effective and hurtful, huh?! *rolls eyes* 
   When I finally arrived in my first period class which is Earth and Space Science with Mr. Pappas I forgot that we had a unit exam, fuuuuunnnn!!!.. I think I did good on it so I not to worry about that. Then Mary and myself made up the phrase ""P.O.N.G.U""..ask me about it and you will get more information later
   After another period of just talking to Mary I went to my second period thinking that I was going to be talking to Mary most of the time I find out that I have been moved! Ugh, just freakin' wonderful, but then I find out that it was next to Kelly B. (Not problem with her) and Stephanie Lange (UGH!! She just decided over Christmas break that she wanted to turn gothic.) Well, when the period progress more into the hour and Kelly and I were having a blast! She walked over to the other side of the room several times to put the sleep mode on Christina's computer twice and then Norm's it was hilarious! Then when that ended she kept shutting my moniter off. After several times of this endless action I finally shut hers off about fifteen times. We laughed for another 20 minutes straight or so then we got yelled at by the interrupter of one of the students. We shut up for about two minutes then went at it again us shutting off our moniters. Then Mrs. Patterson came in and yelled at us. Then she moved Kelly into a completely other room! Hahaha, I think on her behave that was the worst move she could possibly did...lmao!! 
   After all that I went to homeroom with the most wonderful teacher ever...haha Mrs. Patterson! Well, that didn't go along with me to good. So, I just decided to go to the library with Brandon B. and just surf the internet for a little bit. Nothing really excited happened there, and then I just went to lunch.
   For third period I have Intergrated Math with Ms. Iaccont so common sense that I wasn't really looking forward to that too much. When I got there it wasn't all that bad. Watch so preps get yelled at a couple times (rather amusing in my opinion) then we wrote a prompt most of the period. Oh gosh, that was a killer. I can't stand writing overall so how was I going to enjoy the fact that it was about math? After those grueling 80 minutes I finally got the son of a bitch done...mwhaha! When I handed that in I got my test back from yesterday that was about geometry and I received a A+..YEAH!! Haha..so so happy! Then off to four period, which wasn't all that exciting, besides the fact that Chad said the f!@# in class, but nothing too special.
   When I got home I found out that my pap was in the hospital! I started crying because I thought he wasn't ever going to come home ever, but I found out that is wasn't too serious. Then me and my brother were wrestling around but not in a playful way and he made me flip off his bed backwards and slam into his chest of drawers, and in result of that I think I broke my big toe, sliced my knee open, and scraped my arm. So, I kind of got my ass kicked. Sooo anyone out there that is afraid of me...be afraid of my brother!...hehe!

"event","Well, I am kind of late for telling how my Christmas went but hey! 

     I woke up not by my own will, but from my mom waking me up. That is rather weird because I am usually up before everyone else. I finally got downstairs around 8:00, to find my dad watching Van Helsing in the living room. We waited around longer for my brother to finally arise from his bed. When he came to the room we was rolled up in his blanket like a cacoon, and he just fell onto the couch. I waited for another fifteen minutes for him because we are not allowed to start without each other. Finally, when we started opening the presents I received...

-Clothes
-Texas Instrusment Calculator (More advanced then the ones we use for 9th grade)
-Shrek 2 DVD
-Princess Diaries 2 DVD (?!?)
-Manicure Set
-Hairbrush Set
-Fingernail Polish Dryer thing
-Paintball Gun Case
-Virgin Mobile V5 Slider Cell Phone...haha!
-$200

After I received that I went over to my Grandma's house for dinner to find out my cousin was there! Your probably thinking soo?! He was not suppose to be there, he was stationed in Hawaii or Oklahoma and wasn't suppose to come in, so that was a BIG surprise. So, overall my Christmas went pretty well besides the fact that there was not snow and that it did not feel like Christmas at all!!


**I cannot not get my brother's f*cking phone activated...ga damnit!!!"

   Today, my dad asked me to go to Lowe's with him so I did because I had nothing else better to plus I wanted to spend some time with him. On our ride there he asked me a question that he hasn't ever asked me my entire 15 years of living!! He asked me ""What do you want for Christmas?"" I was surely stunned, but I kept my face blank because I didn't want him to notice. I said to him ""I don't know."" Honestly, I didn't. I was happy enough for the fact that he asked me that one simple question.  When we got there we went up and down the aisles looking for whatever he was interested in finding.  So, I was getting this feeling of boredom of me so I started twirling around in a circle, and what do you know I smack into a barricade...haha. Right after I did that my dad said ""Stop twirling around like a moron before you take this whole building down,"" after that he just started making fun of me more. Then when he handed me something that was wrapped in a plastic cylinder I started twirling it. I was doing all the tricks that I learned in Silks spinning around, tossing it up (that wasn't a good thing he made fun of me more for dropping it) I was being a complete idiot, but hey I was having fun and by the looks of it he was too. On the way home my mom called him on his cell phone and started bitching at him. So, therefore that put him in a bad mood for some of the way home, but he cooled down eventually. When we got home and sat down my mom started bitching again. She was saying all this shit to him and he was responding back with more nasty details. Then he said something that she had no come back to sooo she f*cking brings me up!! She said, ""Your f*cking daughter is to scared to ask you for money!!"" (yes, I am a little because my dad does intimidate me a little but I don't know) And then he looks straight over at me and says, ""Come on Chelsea, tell her this isn't the truth!"" I just looked down and then he looked at me in horror and disbelief. Then I said, ""Well, kind of yeah."" Then he said flipping, ""You know what f*ck Christmas! F*ck Seven Springs! F*ck Skiing! (I'm in the ski club) and you know what F*ck You! When I heard those words come out of my father's mouth I just broke down...


   All I was thinking about at that time was ""Oh my god my life is all f*cked up! I freaking hate my mother! I was unfortunately I was thinking about resorting to cutting myself then I realized why the hell would I want to destroy my life anymore like my one ""friend did"" in the past, but the problem is...she still does it!
          
           -Chelsea"

I completely agree with this truce. I did overreact we both know it. I am really happy that we have gotten through this and I hope we can learn from this situation. And I would like to to keep us skating to together in mind but one huge ass problem is that...I am not to good! I mean I can stay on it pretty well but I still suck ass. :-P lol. I said it once and I'll say it again I'm sorry. I am glad that we got through this!"

"event","First, off I would like to say is that Amie I am sorry. Your probably thinking fuck you bitch and that is fine. Your allowed to have your own opinion about someone. It's just the point that you were saying it behind my back, and just out of no where because I never had anything before it's just when this came up I was just really surprised and extremely confused. To the people that commented I agree with everyhting you said. She just said a simple comment I fucking over reacted. My temper is one of the worst things about me, and it is extremely hard to control it. Amie I am not asking you to forgive me it just, I'm sorry. It's just that I have been having 'alot' of problems at I home I cannot deal with and when these pointless situation I snap. I'm sorry."

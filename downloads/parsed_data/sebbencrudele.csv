"event","So I really DO understand where others are coming from in saying that somtimes I have a negative attitude... because I do, but everone dose some time or a nother as well..  I just hate being judgted on asumtions.. or having others put me down with out knowing me..

Weather it was a joke or someone thinking I needed a reality check, The simple act of putting that pamphlet in my box hurt me a lot..

It feel like its dumb for me to justify myself in this situation, but here it goes..


the majority of the negative comments that come out of my moth are eather from pure scarcasim, or me attempting to start a coNversation when noting else is there to be said..  sometimes my negative words are in some way a sign of me putting effort towards somthing with the mask of negativity..

The past few moths has given me time to realize why I do the things that I do...

If you want to know somthing...ask me..
PLEASE
instead of asuming

GIVE ME A CHANCE
(LOVE)"

"event","Oddly I have not posted anything since I've moved in or started school.  Things have been crazy.  Cornish is amazing and absolutely perfect for me.  My classes are helping me be more calm and have a better sense of who I am and what I'm doing..  Everyday is a new adventure and I love it..  I picked up a new book at Bailey/Coy that has been inspiring the shit out of me.. :P    Its about Zen Koans and how everything is nothing...

""How much  do you do for praise?  How many things do you say just to make an impression on others.  What are you really achieving when you try to make an impression? And how many accounts do you have to keep?  If you didn't do things for merit and advancement, or if you didn't act with motives at all, what would life be like?  At work? In bed? Alone in a room?  Even alone in a room you can be consumed with wanting others to see you in a good light.  Can you imagine how things would be different with out that kind of wanting?"" - John Tarrant

I realize how much time I spend waiting... waiting waiting for someone to be impressed by me, fall in love with me, for others to view me in a certain light, for opportunities to come my way...  When I wan something asking dose nothing.  I am ether asking or waiting..  I want to lean how to sub consciously wait and want.  That way I really be expecting anything or be disappointed if I dont get what I want."

"event","So basically everyone is insane!&nbsp; This weekend was amazing! Seussical ended.&nbsp; Saterday nigh was the last time I&nbsp; would ever perform on stage at ARHS... (Such an amazing feeling!)&nbsp;&nbsp; That night was my best show by far! I feels so odd to be done with high school drama...&nbsp; I'm not even part of that anymore I've spent the last 6 year being in shows that Mrs. Seman has dericted and I'll never being in her shows anymore...&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm soooo ot even here anymore...&nbsp; In my mind I'm already in Seattle.. (God! I cant Wait!!!)

In other news I have a big mouth...&nbsp; Anyone who knows me even the slighest bit knows NOT to tell me ANYTHING! lol (unless you one of a select few..)

My Story:
Saterday night after the show we had a cast party...&nbsp; This girl(who was in the show)&nbsp;decided to tell me that she had sex with one of the techs.&nbsp; She said it happened 3 times, all wail the show was going on.. OMG Are you dumb!?!&nbsp; You dont tell ME somthing like this!&nbsp; Of corse I told eveyone... :X&nbsp; MS. Seman found out and the guy will most likly lose his job.&nbsp; I honestly dont know if she told me just to get attention or if it was realy true.. meh eather way its sad...&nbsp; Hella shit is going down!

Dance tonight?&nbsp; I'm sure it will be amazing! &lt;3"

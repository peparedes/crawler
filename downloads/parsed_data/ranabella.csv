For the most part.

Then I have these days. Days like today, where I wake up realy sad. I wake up alone, feeling alone, lonely, and this horrible feeling in my tummy that no one will ever love me again, I blew all my chances, I'm going to die cold and alone.
These mood swings come out of no where, so I can't even tell people why I'm sad. I don't know why I feel the way I do. There's no reason to be as sad as I am. Then on top of all that, I start to feel guilty for the way I feel. Like so many people have *real* reasons to be horribly depressed, I'm just a whiney baby.
So then I feel guilty, sad, and most of all lonely. I feel so useless and like a drain on the world and everyone around me.
I'm 22 and can't even spend a single night alone. If I *am* alone, I have to have the TV, radio, AIM, ICQ, YahooMessenger etc. on all the time. I don't sleep. Zach went out for beers last Thursday and I couldn't fall asleep until he got back at 3am. I tossed and turned for hours, even though I had worked that day at 7:00am, drank a few beers with friends and was tired. I had to call in to work the next day because I had bad dreams and was too depressed to get out of bed. I said I had a migrane, but it was because I was too sad to get out of bed. 

There wasn't even a reason to be sad. 

I feel better now, I just had to get that out. :)"

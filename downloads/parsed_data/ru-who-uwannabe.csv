"event","My Christmas was fun.  we did things a little different this year: we normally go to Louisiana, and visit family.  But this year it was just my immediate family and we cooked a bunch of food and layed around the house all day watching movies.  

I woke up this morning at 1 o'clock; i was suppose to be at work at 1! So i've been here since about 1:15 and i wont be able to leave until 5 o'clock...BORING!!

I miss Billy! He's been in Hayleyville since Friday!! I Love him so much! I'm so lucky!

To Billy:
(Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself
Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms
There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life

If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've been so alone
And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done

It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

A window breaks, down a long, dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see, through the dark there is light

Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
And if you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought that I'd love anyone so much

It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way the back where I come from
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong)


**I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on
And learn how to face my fears
Love with all of my heart, make my mark
I wanna leave something here **"

***Take my hand
'Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Love is all we need here
The Space Between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The Space Between
Your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time
The Space Between...  

***I walk into this room
Oh, all eyes on me now
But I do not know the people inside
They look straight through me, these eyes
Seeking more wisdom than I have to give away
Realize, realize what you are...

Ok, the weekend is about over :( and now its time to get serious with finals!!
*** Please help me pray, there is a close friend who doesn't know Christ, pray for them to understand Christ, and to not give up.
*** Please pray for me to be a good witness to this person, b/c i'm still a baby in Christ and i often dont know what to say, and the words don't always just come easy to say; so i need help from Jesus so be equip with the word and mindful of his truth!

""True""

I wont talk
I wont breathe
I wont move till you finally see
That you belong with me

You might think i dont look
But deep inside
In the corner of my mind
Im attached to you
Im weak
Its true
Cuz im afarid to know the awnsers
Do you want me too?
Cuz my heart keeps fallnig faster

Ive waited all my life
To cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So i wont hide
Its time to try
Anything to be with you
All my life ive waiting
This is true

You dont know what you do
Everytime you walk into the room
Im afarid to move
Im weak
Its true
Im just scared to know the ending
Do you see me too?
Do you even know u met me?

Ive waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So i will not hide
Its time to try anything to be with you
All my life ive waited

This is true

I know when i go ill be on my way to you
The way thats true

Ive waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So i will not hide
Its time to try anything to be with you
All my life ive waitied

This is true

Well..........I LOVE BILLY!!!!!!!!!"

I go to school then to work, then to billy's and then to shannon's....that's my schedule every day, and there's no time for my parents. They leave before i wake up, and they go to sleep before i get home. it really gets to me sometime, and its hard to not go to billy's cuz i'm completely crazy for him, and his family is AWESOME, and they're actually around whenever i'm there; they talk and spend time with each other and eat dinner together every night. My family goes out to eat almost every night; my uncle and aunt live with us; they do nothing but watch tv all night; and they're in bed by 9 or 9:30, b/c they have to get up at like 4:45 in the morning. I know that's no excuse to not spend some time with my family, but its just really hard, cuz my whole day is always stressful everyday, and Jesus is all i have during the day...its not like highschool where you have friends and teachers... so whenever i get off work i want someone there for me, and my family is always tucked and snoozin' whenever i get off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I am very blessed, and the LORD is amazing for the second chances and all the wonderful people he has put in my life. I thank him for everything. And i need him the most right now. Especially with finals coming up, cuz i'm just hangin in there, and these are going to make or break me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *I also pray that Jesus will ease my mind from all these worries in my life: School; Family; Billy ;$$$$$ (need more of it)</EM></FONT></P>

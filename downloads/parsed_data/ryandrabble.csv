COPIED FROM MARK UTLEY'S POST ON MYSPACE:
=============================================================================
If anyone remembers Under The Bridge, the old show I was doing on the internets, there's a newer version that's going on Sasktel Max's new channel, Local On Demand, starting tomorrow (run on!).

The premiere contains interviews and performances from Geronimo (Regina) and Nolto (Saskatoon) and more performances from Pearson (Saskatoon) and Means (Regina), as well as a feature with Ron Spizziri of CFCR.

If you have Sasktel Max (it's available in Saskatoon, Regina, Prince Albert, Moose Jaw, Swift Current, North Battleford, Estevan, Weyburn and Yorkton), go to channel 48 and look for Under The Radar. It's on demand so you can watch it anytime, as many times as you want and for free.

So yeah... do it! (and feedback is always appreciated)

Thanks!

-mark

(ps- I've never asked people to do this before but if you wouldn't mind reposting this to your other internet nerd friends, that would be appreciated!)

igop is exploding.  expect to see us putting on some realy exciting shows over the next few months.  now that lysh is in town things are running smooth and we are caught up.  feels good.  tickets are now on sale for final fantasy at vinyl exchange and vinyl dinner! hylozoists tix will be availible as of monday.

last night was grand!
quite a few people came out and the show was excellent.  it far surpassed previous snailhouse shows.  jeremy's performance was a really neat soundscape kinda deal and cat pontoon (cate) was a fun dance/satire/musical piece, a refreshing addition to a night of good music that put a smile on everyones face. RTDA were charming as always.  breakfast and wandering broadway this morning were delightful as well.  this week has been awesome so far. MSTRKRFT was also great on tuesday, killer dance party!

kira came home from her adventures and i can't wait to hear about her travels.  i kinda feel like i can start living again.  it's unfortunate that i ever stopped.  

going to help tanis pack today... it is starting to sink in that my oldest friend is leaving in a week.  but i am really excited for her.  she has been wanting to move back to BC ever since we met.  plus, i get all her stuff ;P

my house is a great, it has done wonders for my state of mind i feel ""together"" both physicaly and mentaly.  stability as a contrast to the rollercoster this year has been...  ...what a ride it has been.

it was really fun being in edmonton for the last few games, exciting times.
i found myself enjoying hockey again.  watched game 6 in the strat and game 7 at the poutine house.
after the crushing defeat i went ""drinking"" in a park with mario, GHK, mary and some new friends. ended up playing on the swings and slides for a few hours.  i have got to do a lot of cool stuff.  i spent a ton of time over the last couple days with the meligrove boys, laughed so hard i was sore this morning.  could definatly stand to see more of those guys and i might get the chance.

edmonton is being very kind to me.

i went shopping (i never do that!)  
new pants, shirts, cd's, shoes...  and a transmission :P
i am starting to think about things like decorating my house, and for that matter, finding one.
a lot of potential options for me right now, but i definatly need to spend some time figuring out which way i want to head.  might as well take it slow, let things unfold without rushing them.

i will be home later this week i think, might make a brief stop in red deer first."

we spent the night in a hotel waiting to get the van fixed after we started overheating severly yesterday.

fortunatly, they are quite simple to replace, so we will back on the road in no time.
looks lke we are going to cut it close on getting back for the show tomorrow, but we should be ok as long as the boarder dosn't take long

i miss the desert already.  it was so warm down there.  
i left my wolfnote bunnyhug at the last show we played, so now i have no jacket :(

"event","wow,
it really blows my mind down here.  its the little things...
i went in to a gas station today that had about 20 different kinds of beef jerky, a wall of beer coolers and the most outragious pop machine, ever.  it had things in it had never heard of... and everthing is MEGA-ULTRA-SIZED. 
the states have been pretty neat so far, but i still feel like any moment they are going to realize a subversive canadian made it in to there country and kick me out, i am afraid of americans.

so far i have seen seattle and portland, next is oakland, then sanfransico!
after that L.A. and a long drive to austin.  i will post up the list of shows i plan on trying to get into soon, but just to name a few...  islands, thunderbirds are now!, moving units, the gossip, erasure errata, xiu xiu, clap your hands say yeah, we are wolves, ex girl, and joey, peep this - the effigies, clorox girls, applicators, all playing the same show as the ultimate power duo :P 
PLEASE! if there any rad bands playing SXSW you would recomend, hook me up! 

i am in a hotel, somewhere in oregon. time to get some sleep :)

it is truly mind blowing to realize i am sitting in a coffee shop, downtown vancouver.
i am here with noting but a dirty floor to sleep on, my laptop and my wits.   
miles from home, sick, wet, tired. i miss my friends, my house and my cats.

<lj-cut text=""my trip:"">
supper was great last night guys!  thank you for making me feel so special.
the flight was confusing (mostly cause i couldn't think due to my cold)
but i got to sit by myself on the flight into van, even the plane was almost completely full!
my brother was waiting for me at the airport and guided me from bus to bus to cab across most of the lower main land.
i ending up missing the show so i could help him clean up his old room till 6am saskatoon time. woke up in some suburb which i can't remember the name of and started the 1:30 public transit trek back down town to his new place, a single room in a rough old house.  the block is gorgeous, trees and colorful houses wih moss growing on their shingles.
it is in chinatown, only a few blocks from the sketchiest corner in the world: main & hastings. allan had to head to work almost as soon as we got there. our walk brought us past alleys full of rough types peddling drugs and shouting incoherently, the heart of chinatown, full of new smells, interesting sights and the towering office buildings of west downtown.  i am exhausted, and my cold has taken firm hold.  a warm cup of tea and wireless are a welcome relief.

now it is off to find my first meal since i have arrived, then exploring.  later i will be at the railway club taking in blood meridian, lady hawk and hard drugs (the band silly!).   

i feel like i am getting a chance to prove what i am capable of.  i will own this town by spring, watch out vancouver.

... i really fucking miss you guys."

edmonton was wowzors, i had soo much fun i can't even describe it...
but i will try in a method taught to me by brianwolfnote

""$20!!!""
""an extra dollar if you do it in an alley""
""$40 if you do it in a burning church with a virgin""
""SUUVVV""
""we only have one beer, canadian, and it is 8.50 a jug.""
""so mark was it more comfortable sleeping on the stove or the kitchen floor?""
""YOU SON OF A BITCH!""
""looks like garret hates the french a little less""
""rockstar...tastes horrible, but it works""
""here let me count on my hand how many girls you guys talked to... oh right it was NONE""
""rockstar in my mouth... story of my life""
""i thought you had it won there for a moment""
""GET TO THE CHOPPER!""

bands were great,  fucking ""no cops"".  struts own. too bad we didn't get to hang out more :P

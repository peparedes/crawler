"event","I think this is just going to be a bad week.  

Do you ever get that feeling like your entire life is wasted, and you've got a generally worthless bit of substance called a brain just sort of hanging out and sloshing around in a pool of equally worthless individuals?  Certainly you do, if you're a stereotypical pseudogothie.  I, on the other hand, rarely feel such things, as I am not a member of the considerably degenerate subculture of the aforementioned group.  Today, however, was a day on which I did seem to be unhappy with said life and brain, and I was displeased. That should go without saying, since displeased and unhappy go together, etc... or whatever.  

But I was sitting at work today and thinking ""What do I really want?""  In the end, I came up with exactly nothing.  Nothing.  Exactly.  Hrm.  It wasn't a bad day, or anything.  It was just a day of reflection, and on days of reflection I realize that my reflection seems to hold only me in it.  What's that mean?  You be the judge!  No, because you'll just misunderstand.  Or maybe you knew this all along, and just neglected to inform me: sometimes I feel like I should be alone.  Sometimes I feel like I should do something with my life other than play games and cook food.  Sometimes I think I should go and do everything in one night that I feel I should do that night instead of second-guessing myself and saying ""no"" a lot.  Basically, sometimes I feel I should be someone else.  But why work against something that's working so well for the long-term?  I'm headed for responsibility; money, friends, and love may very well be in my sights.  I just have to wait and get my mind out of whatever hole it's dug into."

Firstly, I must state that my annoyance is growing daily.  A company I once worked for is rather refusing to send me my tax form.  That makes my life a tad more complicated.  I shall have to smite someone for this.  

I get paid today.  That's good, considering I have exactly $1.06 on me right now.  I can buy .96 gallons of gas with it, or a 2-liter of pop.  I think I shall save it.  I get free pop at work, which I go to in a couple of hours.  I haven't talked to Paul in a week or so.  The new lady, some 39-year-old with feathered hair and a she-mullet, is generally scary and annoying.  She likes to update me on her life day-by-day.  For example: three days ago, she said ""My computer is annoying.  It's a Windows 98 P133"", etc etc etc.  Yesterday she informed me that it crashed.  I informed her that crashing is not to be taken lightly, because crashing is when your hard drive is wiped.  Hers didn't crash.  Just rebooted.  I informed her, in direct response, that Windows drivers are inherently faulty and will do that just to get back at you.  ""Oh,"" she said.  Then proceeded to talk about how she used to grow her nails long and sharpen them so she could play pool better.  I went to go wash dishes.  

I'm fully energized now, though.  I finally got some sleep that lasted a little while.  It was full of all kinds of good dreams, if your definition of ""good"" is ""generally boring but filled with moments of anger that seem sorta real, but when waking up are pointless"".  

A bit of a good song for now; The Shizit, ""Soundtrack for the Revolution""

A thousand images a day 
 to control us, to bring us to a higher purpose
Buy, buy, bye;    
 My life, I've spent you for what?
 Nothing but a distraction
 from a lack of interaction!"

"event","I was sitting here wondering how people ever see other peoples' journals on this.  There are thousands of users, and you never really realize how many people take a look, or anything.  And it's almost impossible to find anybody with the Find Users By Interest link, because it stops letting you see them after so many: For example, try searching for ""Godsmack"" or ""Dancing"".  You get nothing! 

So in the spirit of boredom, and being home all day, I propose you do the following;
 
Click on each of your friends' names.  Open them in a new window.  Click each of that friend's friends.  Click each of those friends' friends.  The only secret to doing this is never click on the same name twice, and don't count yourself.  See how many people you can find.  I ran into several dead-ends, but by using Ninhydrin as a starting point, I gave up after writing down 239 names.  If someone else has more patience, tell me the results after you're done."

"event","Everyone keeps making a big deal about me not writing on this thing for somewhere around a year.  9 or 10 months, I think, is more appropriate.  I never could keep a journal.  There's never been much I could get excited about, ya know?  And when you don't get excited about much, there isn't much to write about.  Makes perfect sense, I'm sure.

Remember the following!: Never play a critical game against a sore loser.  They will just mope and get all pissed off if you stomped them into the ground.  I'm being a bit spiteful about that.  I play this wargame, you see, called Warhammer 40000, and I'm involved in a campaign.  We were playing a fight in a city, and the objective was to get from one end of the board to the other, while he was supposed to stop me.  When the rules state the table is supposed to be 60 inches across, and I have the fastest army in the game, moving from 24-36 inches in a turn if I want to, such a mission is easy for me.  He was not happy about this, because I won in two turns and he didn't give me the slightest resistence.  Anyway.

On people-issues: Reading Kelly's latest journal was a bit of a shock to me.  I never did quite understand all that with school.  Oh, well.

On college: It's kinda funny to be complaining about homework, and then realize ""Oh, wait.  All I do for homework is draw.""  

That shall be my entry for the next 8 months."

"event","Well, then.  It took us about an hour to get to the place ... it was entertaining.  We bypassed the road we were looking for and drove about 11 miles out of town before I said ""You know, we even though it's illegal, we should probably U-turn around here somewhere.""  And so we did, and went back into town.  Funfun.  But the food was great.  The conversation was serious, I suppose... about what's wrong with people, which is basically what we talk about every time.  We seem to agree on a lot of topics, but then disagree on many, too.  So we talked about what's wrong with society and why people are the way they are, and I tried explaining my pseudo-religion a little.  And then we left.. We were there for about an hour and a half, I guess.  A little rickety place... But I bought a Rat Bastard Rootbeer.  Heehee.  And yeah.  Then we came back without getting lost.  It was a good thing.  Only took us like, 20 or 25 minutes... 
Hrm.  I haven't talked to Jessica much today.  Tomorrow, thought, perhaps.  I wonder if she's having fun at her play thing now?  She seemed excited... and she likes the food, too.  Heh.  Oh, well.  I hope she's having a good time.  Oh, well.  Time to end this, I guess..."

"event","Hrm... today was nice.  I passed Economics.  I as kinda worried about that.  Eh.  I had a 67 in the class, and I needed like... a 32% on the final exam to pass, and so.. luckily, I got a 78.  If I'd've gotten 4 percent higher, I would've passed the class with a C.  Heh.  
I like giving people ""Fortune Cookies a la Rat""... they're fun!  See... I've given two or three of these things, little ""flip balls"" I guess people used to call them.  Except they're folded to the point where they poof out like a fortune cookie.  And I write little things on the inside, like cryptic messages no one understands but me that hint to the future of what I may do.
Ah.. I'm going to some Vegan restaurant tonight.  Anything to get out of the house.  Normally I'd try to do something with Jessica, which seems to always be outside of my house, but really, I don't care where it is as long as I'm with her, because things don't seem so annoying around here when she's around.  But tonight, and for several nights for the next couple weeks, she's quite busy, so I'll be spending a considerable amount of time on my own or amusing myself with other people.  Tonight I'm going to that restaurant, as I said, with Erika.  We can't find anyone else to go, so I guess it may just be the two of us, but that's cool, I guess.  I just hope I don't bore her terribly, because I often ramble on about stupid things.  But then, she seems to think they're interesting because I think way the hell too much and what I say tends to be slightly enlightened, I guess.  Of course, I've been having a stoopid week.  I can't talk or write very well.  So it's a problem.  Oh, well."

"event","Ah - My first entry.  I never really use journals.  Only when I'm stressed, or contemplative, do I ever write down what I'm thinking.  Of course, I think a lot, so a lot goes in ""personal storage"", I suppose.  But when I write things down, it's often the things I NEED to sort out for need of mental relaxation.  Writing on paper seriously bothers me.  When you type 102 words/minute, pen-and-paper journals seem horribly inefficient.  But by contrast, these computer journals also seem cold in their efficiency.  Perhaps if I could change my font, instead of this annoying Courier thing... reminds me too much of Notepad.  Anyway.  So I'm not sure as to exactly how much I'll be 'writing' in this thing.  But, oh well... it's open and ready for when I do.  Anyone who reads this - I pity you for the boredom you must be going through."

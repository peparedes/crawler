I think I will go read or something...Okay nvm, Tony just came back. Haha. Whew. I am not alone!!!!

On other news. I enjoyed the Half-Blood Prince very much but that just makes me want the seventh book even more. Haha. There is something buggin me about the way Dumbledore left and about Snape as well. Grrr, but I have two years to contemplate on it! X_X"

so yeah i think me and my boys and the ohio girls are going dancing man i love them i wish they would stay for ever huggie is so much fucking fun when theyre around i love her!!!  i really hadnt thought about it but i guess my summer has gotten off to a pretty good start.  im off to sacramento for the no doubt blink 182 concert in the mourning with my baby cousin it should be definate good times....maybe i just wont sleep tonight! hmmm i cant seem to shut up right now

On their way home they were hit by a drunk driver.  My two cousins flew through the windshield and were taken to the hospital the car flipped over 3 times and ended up with my aunt pinned underneath.  All I can think about is my uncle screaming ""who did this where are they"" as they pulled the sheet over her face.  She was a good woman and a good mother.  I dont think that there is anything she wouldnt have done for them.....it breaks me heart.....i just saw her and i cant come to terms with the fact that ill never see her again....its like my dad said tonight everything happens for a reason and some god out there has a plan....i hope hes right....i really wish i could be there

"event","I havent felt like this in a long time.  For the last little while even when I was dating Kenny...well since John even ...I couldnt really see myself being with someone.  Or even wanted to be with just one person.  Ive dated around ive dated alot of people the last 6 months or so but I just wasnt ready to give that up.  To give up being the PIMP as people say.  Sure I had the feelings everyone has of wanting to be with someone....but nothing more than the momentary thoughts or the feeling we all get when we get lonely.  Now thats all changed.  I think there is someone that I am finally ready to be with.  Tonight Rich and I just sat and snuggled on the couch for like 3 and a half hours we didnt really do anything we werent even kissing really....we sat and hung out with our friends and held hands and laughed and had good conversation and held eachother.  It felt so good and as scary as it is to say it it felt right.  I know nothing will really happen with us right now we havent found that balance between our friendship and our attraction and our sexual chemistry but when and if we do i know it will be great.  I was happy tonight i wasnt even drinking and i know i could be like that all the time.  ya ya i know its all corny but oh well."

It sucked, all I could think about is my parents and my brother and sisters and leaving in a couple weeks.  I cant wait to get out of here.  I know I say it alot but now more than ever Iam thinking about moving there.  Unless theres a good reason for me to stay.

I have no romantic attatchments to anyone Iam seeing.  I lost my best friend seemingly forever.  I know I shouldnt but I miss him so much.  I know he doesnt give a damn about me anymore, which is probably justified, but that doesnt make it hurt any less.  Ive never had someone so loyal who put me up on such a pedistool or ever someone I could stand spending as much time with as I did him, not even in a boyfriend.  Okay I need to shut up now.  I pissed Natalie off last night.  I said what I had to say but I couldnt put my thoughts in order I know what I feel I just couldnt put it in words.  Me and you in this babe is all that matters....no one else.  me and you make and break me and you thats all there is to it.  money sucks.  work sucks.  I want to start over with everything."

Work:  Ive got a second job again so that should mean good money again.  I was making awesome money working more at Santinos, but I was having to work so damn hard for it.  My body cant take it anymore.  Money is tight right now with buying a car and paying for the new semester but once thats over I'll be ok.

Friend:  Nat and I are hanging out again=awesome.  Im hanging with the girls good stuff I love them theyre so much fun.  I miss people but I dont think the ball is in my court anymore I did what I had to do and Iam happy about it.  I havent made my peace but Ive made my effort.  

Family:  Everything is at a good point right now me and my grams arent fighting and I get to see my parents and the kids in two weeks.  I cant wait to see them Im trying not think about it but I cant help it I want to leave now!

Love like and such:  Well things with Kenny were going good for a while but we've been dating for a month and there hasnt been any real progess since our first date.  Im not talking about physical stuff just as far as our relationship goes we havent moved anywhere but no choice of my own.  Going out the other night and finding someone that I was attracted to and being able to kiss them and not feel guilty made me realize things.  I told myself I wasnt aloud to date anyone else because of me and Kenny but there are no rules and he made it that way.  So last night I met someone else.  I dont know where its going to go.  It may turn out to one of those things where we flirted and nothing will happen.  Or it could be a fling.  Or it could be serious either way I dont really care.  He(Patrick) seemed cool and he kissed my on the cheek and we held hands and he said he would call me this week and try to go to Trevors on Friday so we'll see! and for whoever you are that seems to let me know you think im a slut and need to pick one person who the hell are you to say such things.  im young and no one said I had to settle down with one person i dont know anyone who is not even Natalie......There isnt a slutty bone in my body faithful to a T"

I cant stand it when people act childish.  I know I said alot of things about Jessica but all in all I think shes alright.  People talk and you never know the truth till you find out for yourself.  I hate John.  More thwan anything i think im pissed off that i ever had feelings for someone who could do me the way he did.  Manslut.  I like Kenny i like being with Kenny but he frustrates me.  Rich intruiges me because he wants a relationship like I do.  He believes in romance and for that im hopeless.  Kirsten you rock im glad youve grown the way you have.  Steph i dont care for the way you have treated me lately. i call you when i need someone you ignore me you act like i dont exist.   Nat love you reguardless no matter what my opinion is.  Brian I miss you but shit happens.  Joel I dont understand.  Meg5us i dont get you sometimes but its cool.  Sarah think sometimes...not about yourself.  Josh one too many dudes dude.  Betty and Chuck take a fucking chill pill and have a free refil on me!

"event","Last night totally kicked ass.  I dont really go out anymore.  At least not like I used to anyways.  But last night I was just happy to go out and I didnt expect to have as good of a time as I did.  After work I came home showered and got ready and then I went back and picked up Josh.  We he wasnt ready yet cause Ricky was lagging so I did most of his closing work before we could go.  Then he and I went and picked up Lisa and her bf Kegan, they were all faded at first it was kind of annoying but once they came down it was alright.  We met up with Kate and her friend Jade (the newyorkers) at the bowling alley in camarillo.  That was alright we bowled till 12 and I beat everyone.  Yes even Josh.  with my nails on I might add.  So theyre closing and we all decied were gonna go to styx so on the way out there Lindsay calls I tell her to meet us there.  So I look at Josh and I was like lets go to the casino totally not serious and him being buzzed was like.......ok lets go.  We made sure we were both serious and met lindsay at styx and went to the liquor store i totally stocked up on energy drinks josh and i split three big ones and then had two more a piece at the casino but were driving right and all of the sudden we forgot that Kate and Jade were meeting us at styx but it was too late and no one had their number so we kinda felt bad but we were at styx like 15 mins and they never came.  So long story short I had an awesome time at the casino Josh and I stayed at the same table all night long and had a good time being me and josh while winning like $200 a peice and not getting home till 7 this mourning.  So totally worth it......."

"event","Welp all Ive really been up to lately is work and Kenny.  We hang out pretty much when were not at work.  My relationship with him is hard to explain.  Its like nothing Ive ever had with anyone.  The other night we went to dinner with Kirsten and Greg and Im so stoked cause they all like eachother so were gonna hang out all kinds which is cool cause that means i get to hang out with kirsten more.  Then after that we met up with Nat and Jeff to see the Matrix.  It was ok I was a little disappointed though.  Im really happy with the way things have worked out in my life.  I heard from a source that John said he was with that girl all along.  I dont even want to fuss about it Im just gonna let it be.  It sucks that that happened because I really truely care about him and knowing that hurts more than ever but you cant change anyone else.  Work is good right now Im making lots of money.  The concert tonight kinda sucked I mean I still love the Ataris but it was so MTVed out.  It was teenybopper trendy chicks that knew the words to two songs it drove me nuts.  It was an intense show though so crowded people were passing out left and right.  i almost did myself and i dont think ive ever sweat so much in my entire life.  anyways im gonna go crawl in bed with two of my favorite people nite nite"

There are so many things in the mix right now throw that off, but I think that bottom line.  He came over and then we decieded randomly at 11 that we were gonna go to the casino so we drove up there we both lost 50 bucks which sucked cause we were up all kinds.  Then we got back to my house at like 2 and of course I started to fall asleep like always I kinda feel bad.  But when I was awake we talked and stuff it was cool.  Im pretty sure I did fall asleep a final time cause he woke me up around 6 to say he had to go to work.  Meh oh well he didnt seem to mind.  Im gonna go take a shower before he gets here hehe."

I told him I loved him and I cryed.  He said it back...and I cryed some more.  I feel so good when Im with him I wish we had met eachother now instead of then.  I know we will be together again and Im willing to wait forever.  We both made mistakes and whats done has been done but were starting over.  Complete with his recreation of our first kiss it was the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me.  My hearts racing just thinking about it.  geez I love him........"

"event","More than anything right now I miss him.  I miss John so much.  I have everyday since we broke up.  No matter how many other guys Ive dated or kissed or anything.  I cant get it out of my head.  I loved him.  The way we were molded for eachother the way it felt when he held me.  The way I thought he loved me. Everywhere constant reminders, downtown, the gas station, the beach, my room, my bed, the shower, vons, the sweetfactory, the W3 booth at my work everywhere I go I think about it whether its all night or just for a second.  I think, I think about him, about us, about the way he hurt me.  No matter how much I still love him and I think Id take him back.  It's sick the grip he has on me.  Everytime the one thing that comes to mind was one night he was in the living room talking to my family and I was starting the movie we rented and it took me yelling and calling for him forever for him to come in the room finally he did and I layed in his arms and felt so at peace and so in love that no one else in the room seemed to matter........."

So Ive liked this guy, Rich.  Me and this guy were just friends.  Things are slowly changing.  This week we sat around for a few hours snuggling and talking and I learned alot about him.  He's a great guy.   Charming, good looking, caring, sensitive.  He just may be perfect, the guy baked me a cake and brought champagne for crying out loud.  I like him but things just arent clear yet.  Kenny has already expressed that he likes me and I think I like him but it's different with him.  Hes more the tough guy manly man.   The one who doesnt cry and is convinced hes really good in a certain line of women work.
time will tell.

Good news and bad news Sarah is gonna be around for halloween which means shes going to Dans party with me but not going to Vegas.  Good for me bad for her.  I want things to work out for her Kimmie and myself.  Things are tough right now but I think we'll figure something out.  

Sometimes I get so focused on the way people think of me that it takes me over.  It's not a good thing.  Its stressful to keep up with.  Theres alot of ties ended and I have no problem with it.  I just want to fix myself so I dont make the same mistakes with other people.  Because lord knows everything relationship Ive had go wrong was my fault.  Because theres something wrong with me. I need to fix it."

I just dont find pleasure in anything that I do anymore.  I am extremely bored with everything.  I found a guy that I really think but everything is really complicated with him, it always has been.  I like him enough to be with him and I dont say that about alot of people him being the third to be exact.  He just made me feel good about myself and I feel so comfortable with him.  But I screwed that up...or he did....I dont really know.  Today is day 8 of my thirty days and Im honestly okay about it.  I dont have any desire.  Although Claudias batchlorette party and halloween may be very tempting I may just let one be a freebie.  we'll see.  Sarah and I are awesome as always.  I met her mom tonight it was cool they are so alike.  I really think that Rich my other man and Wednesday Hump Days are the only cool thing in my life right now.  Im making lots of money and moving in with Kimmie thats good stuff.  Well maybe I wont be so boring next week."

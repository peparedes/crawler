"event","I dream of floating fireflys and
Monkeys on the sea
I think of sandy waterfalls and 
Dancing on a scree
I'd like to play and somersalt
Above the oceans front
And sit on little elephants and
laugh and cry and grunt

I want to have a tangerine
That tastes of melon dew
Where big fat worms do gobble goop and
Drink salamander Stew
I want a piglets curly fries
And a green flamingos beak
And bath upon the seasons edge
For answers I might seek

I want to buy a walrus so 
His head is not too fat
And train a tiny porcupine to
Lay upon my mat.
The day of stealing Noahs boat
Cannot come any sooner
But for now I'm quite content
Just playing with my Luna."

"event","I have taken a vow of silence in my house. Mainly because if i talk anymore the razor blades in my thoat threaten to cut right through....
Second because i think people think i talk to much, and that sometimes makes me look shallow.
Thirdly because i think even though i like to assume i listen alot i think i could listen more.,....so we'll see how this goes.
Im not going to go into the events of this weekend because it makes me tired just thinking about it.....so urll have to guess. ha. I went into work today and was told to go home because i probably looked like shit and cetainly sounded like shit. Should i do this more often?"

"event","I have just been informed that Chris has been childishly bitching about me to my friends behind my back. Real mature chris. It seems that hes jealous that i dont want to spend time with him anymore and is consequently turning my friends against me. So just a message to my uni friends, excluding chris, dont listen to him, he has a silver tounge and will say almost anything to get his way. Indeed i could also tell you all the asshole things hes done but i pride myself in not sinking to his level. If you no longer like me because of him, fair does, just wanted to let you know i have nothing against you...just him.&nbsp;
In other news i have been very ill lately and spent a good 20 hrs in bed yesterday, i think it was the lack of sleep from before.

"event","I am becoming a bum. I have only been to 1 lecture this week, done absolutely no work, have been out every night and havnt done my washing up for a week. What the hell is wrong with me, this is very out of character. Cock was down for the week which is the reason i did no work but i have no excuse for the rest of my lack in hygiene and complete laziness. I havnt been running for nearly a week and drinking too much beer, thus developing a pot...this wont do. I need a kick up the ass, and a shower.<br />However yesterdays fun and games was great. Went to Rockworld with Phil, Sandrine and Scott and didnt even drink much as i was sort of still hungover from the night before. There was a very good looking boy on the dancefloor who kept suprisingly popping up every now and again (coincidence?) but as i was stone sober even his good looks didnt sway me and i didnt bother to seem interested.<em>&nbsp;</em>i got home in one piece but didnt get to sleep till at least 4, thanks to phil and sandrine!! its ok i forgive u. so ye my days have all blended into one big wierd lump lately, and im thoughroughly (sp?) enjoying it."

When i say wasted i mean waaaaaaaassssted, so WASTED in fact i cant remember half the night. But i had a lot of fun. It all went downhill when phil made me take a jack hammer (tequila and jack) and then about half a bottle of baileys. Achhh. I had work at 9 this morning, oh my god if it wasnt for Luke who kept giving me hugs to keep me going i think i would have died. Took cock up to the station and now im in my pjs again. I cant belive im going out tonight aswell, im such a tard. I do rather like these new friends im making, much more my kinda people, crazy people!!! i have a bruised eye and cheekbone and i dont know what from, i dont recall falling on my FACE. ah well it alls comes with being young and foolish. An old lady told me she really liked my green hair today in the shop and that she wanted to dye hers pink, shes my idol. she was buying crickets so i think she even has a snake, go old lady, rararara.
ya!&nbsp;

"event","I have to say this weekend was mightily awesome. Friday was Jollyes staff pub crawl and i must say i had an amazing time. It was so nice to see Dave again. Like I forgot what it was like to speak to a genuine person who you admire and who is good looking but with no sexual attraction there whatsoever. Its liberating i tell you. So ye talked to Dave most the night, just needed to talk to someone who doesnt put on a face for ppl and is actually themselves. Sandrine was hilarious, i love her to bits. Anyway so ye started off in the Didsbury followed by Old Cock and them myself, Dave, Sandrine and Chrys went to Fab...where i migth add i only drank water! I figured if i drank more id have a banging headache the next day. Look at me, im getting sensible.
But ye rest of weekend was good on a few aspects. I added an extra 20 minutes to my run, and felt good about it! Me and Chris are on speaking terms again, which is great! All ive eaten is chicken stir fry, not necessarily a bad thing, chicken stir fry rockz my sockz. And ye lazed around, been to blockbuster...watched the Big lebowski and Almost Famous, two rather brilliant movies. And actually did some uni work.
So ye theres my weekend in a nut chell. Oh and Sandrine is coming to Italy with me this easter...yay!"

Yesterday was alright. I dunno....felt like something was missing. I dont feel greatly satisfied. Today has been a lazy day, went to Trof for lunch and just been dozing this afternoon. Im having a horrible anti climax type feeling, like blah, i dunno! Some people can be very hurtful. A few important people in my life havnt bothered contacting me which makes me&nbsp;a little sad. Also being single isnt all that fun at times...no responsability but i miss being the most important person to somebody.&nbsp; 
Anyway this is a depressing post! i guess getting older makes you think a little about things, looking at your life so far and wanding if ur happy with it. Im very happy with my life but there are always those days where u feel like telling the world to go screw itself. 
Go screw yourself.
Its funny how you build up somebody or something in your mind to be good and then it turns out their not all their cracked up to be and you wonder why you really worried about it. I think from now on I'll spend more time worrying about important things and concentrating on my work.
Ive eaten too many quality street today...just munching through them watching deal or no deal."

"event","Well havnt done this in a while. I have a new job, in a petfood store, and i love it. I really do. The people there are great and im becoming better at giving people advice and i just feel really fitted in there. And i get paid soon! woot.
Anyway am off for easter hols now but not going home although my dad called me today saying he wanted me to come home and hates the thought of me here by myself. I thought it was sweet. So i might go home fore a few days if i have time.
Havnt heard from Bunac (USA camp thing) yet but Chris has been given a place which is great. So ye apart from the essays and revision life is good right now. Oh ye and one bullshit thing! Well Pearl Jam are FINALLY coming to London. HOWEVER! not only have i already prebooked theatre tickets for the same date but the tickets sold out in minutes as it was an intimate 1600 people concert. I would have killed to go see them but im hoping is i get the camp counsellor job i might be able to see them while im still in the States (fingers crossed!)
Chris has gone home for a week so im pretty lonely, I'm gonna go watch a movie with one of my other friends tonight maybe..... depends on if i decide to do some more work on my essay.
Yep see why i dont make entries? boring stuff. I guess i should try to be more creative in my posts rather than 'then i did this and then i did that'
But to be honest i cant be arsed."

I gotta stock the shlves and keep the customers happy, do till work and serve ice cream hehe. I got about 6 ppl asking me today if we have advent calenders and i had to tell em we ran out of stock...mostly they were estranged fathers who forgot to get them for their kids, lol. I had one wierd guy who told me im 'obviously christmas staff' after i had difficulty with a voucher he was using...bastard. However promtly found out that hes the local wierdo and likes to insult all the staff which made me feel a little better, lol. Anyway walking up and down stairs, smiling and being nice to ppl all day, let alone how fuzzy my eyes went from till work really takes it out of u. I called Chris when i came out and he told me that we wernt going to OP dinner liie usual ( thank fuck) and to go up to his room at 8 so im really exited now, apparently im getting a suprise....how sweet:) I feel like the empowered working woman going home to the house husband lol....well not quite, ANYWAY.

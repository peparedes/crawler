"event","<br /></center><br><font size=""1""><font color=""#66CC66""><br />oh my gosh, i'm so fucking irritated, and pissy and bitchy today. you have no clue. and i really dont even know why. Well besides the fact my mom is fucking up again and i'm obease (had to get alex's help w/ spelling) lol. and i didn't get the fucking job cos i'm not 16. You always have to be 15 or 16 FUCK! gRR...i'm stressed. and tired but i got medicine from the doctor and everything will be good tommorro. my mom...oh jeez where should i begin? she is so fucked up and i really dont think that she is gettin a place to live. She is gonna live with her friends her whole life. And that really pisses me off. She was like sick today so we dropped her off at the hospital in orange city on our way home. I haven't really be on AIM latley cos like its being a fucker...and i will be like in the middle of a convo. and all the sudden it will quit. w/e fuck that. mamawl is being such a annoyance today...she fucking nags on me to do stupid shit. Like today she came in here and asked me to sweep the porch...why the fuck would i go and sweep the fucking porch? what the hell is the point?? gosh so i went out there and sweeped the fuckin porch and then she comes out and says that looks nice. gee thanks i'm so fucking glad. Oh and then another thing that was <i>really</i> bothering me was i asked mamawl if i could get something to eat a McDonalds cos i was hungry as fuck and papawl starts bitching about it like he always does. Gosh...All there is to eat here is like hot dogs and fried balogna...gross. Fuckin nasty bullshit. Food is nasty. oka i kno i'm a bit of a bitch today. sry. But i just have to vent cos i really dont have anyone to talk to about it. I really am lonley. Well i guess im done."

"event","Hey hey...well things are doing well...i'm <b>very</b> happy for lots of reasons. I feel like i've actually accomplished something this summer. But yeah. Everyone is going on vacations and shit...mine isnt unil the end of July and we are gonna go to the Bahamas...it will be great. It will feel so wierd like being back home. Cos i used to live there for a year. But yeah. Tommorro i have a doctors appointment at 7:50 in the morning and the office is in Altmonte. Damn that will require me to wake up at like 6...geeez. I'll be sleepin on the way there no doubt about that. But yeah my moms car is being a piece of shit and she has to be there with me cos the doctors are gay and so it will be me and her and my grandpawl...(he is driving). I think she might spend the night tonight. Thats sounds funny...my mom spending the night wiht me...?? lol...anyways. Um...today ashcrack got a CD player put in her car from curcit city and then like somehow we got this idea to apply for jobs...yeah so she didnt since she already has 2 of them..but i applied at Fazolis and Chick-Fa-la...or however you spell it. But um... there was a bitch working at chick-fa-la. And Fazolis wants me to come back tomorro at 3:30 for a interview...i dont think they kno i'm 14 tho. thats the bad thing about it. but hopefully i will get a job. I hope. Cos i hate sittin around this fuckin boring house all day with not a damn thing to do. Well i'm hungry and so i'm gonna go eat.

"event","i'm so unsure about my mom and this whole thing. She really REALLY stresses me out...yano.  Its always one thing after another with her. She is just all talk and no action. I hate to say it...but its the truth. 

And well for me. I dont even know where to begin. I'm so fat...and so fuckin hungry. i'm practally living off of cough drops cos there is all nasty stuff here that i dont want. And of course i dont have a job cos i'm ""too young"" for everywhere thats hireing.(i duuno how to spell it) jee its such a simple word too. But yeah. I guess i'm just really stressed out. When i shouldn't be. Amber and Ashley arent here that much anymore...which is a good thing. I like it here without them sometimes...its just boring. lol. I'm such an idiot.

Well see what was supposted to happen today is...my mom come to my house and pick me up at like 8 and than we go to her job ( cos she ""works"" on the beach) and then she gets off and then we go and get my little sisters and whatnot. But there is always a solutionless problem with her. And instead of her picking me up, she didn't cos she sed i wouldn't wake up...well its summer and i dont wake up everymorning like i have somewhere to go or something to do...becos i usually dont. And then so my mom didn't pick me up and my grandmawl was like forcing me out of bed to go and eat at McDonalds...which was a fucking joke cos one it was 9:00 in the morning and two i dont like breakfast especially McDonalds. Yuck. And so i stayed in bed until about 12 and then called my mom whom at the time was suppostedly working. Then she was like ""yeah well i get off at 3 and then i'm coming to get you."" right. that was another fucking joke. Well its like already 4 and she wasn't here so i called her and was like ""wtf are you doing?"" and she was like crying and shit and sayin how somethin is wrong with her car and blah blah blah...w/e same shit different day with her. always. I'm jsut sick of it. And then she askes me if i want to spend the night with her at her friends house...WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING  7 YEARS OLD? YOUR SUPPOSTED TO HAVE YOUR OWN HOUSE...but no. Its like i wanted to laugh in her face and just hang up the fone. She isn't 16 anymore and she defenately doesn't have anyone to fucking take care of her. She needs to learn to take care of herself. She acts like she is incapable of getting STABLE job and making some money so i'm not stuck in this hell hole for the rest of my life and the same with my sisters. Ugh. GERRRRRRRRRRRRR. i'm just frusturated with her. I though that parents are supposted to take care of their kids? well i feel like i'm taking care of her. Its not my job, its nobodys. She needs to be responsiable for herself.

Alright i'm done bitching to a fuckin web page nobody is gonna read. i might as well just go eat.

"event","i'm so mad right now. my cousin is such a fucking bitch! ugh i really hate her. and i hate having to share a room with her and i hate listening to her talk about how she thinks all these guys like her. yeah they like her...they'd like to fuck her. Gosh she makes me so mad...and she says i never do anything,..oh bullshit cos i've cleaned this room atleast 9 times and her and her friends fucking come back here and mess it up...so yano i just stoped. I dont really give a fuck becos she can't sit here and fuckin tell me that. i dont wanna fuckin hear it. I'm so fucking sick of living here i really REALLY  wish that my mom would hurry the hell up and get a house. But i can't count on anything she says she is gonna do.,.cos its just that way with her.

i havent seen any of my friends in deland in a loooonnng time. *sigh* i miss them. i wish i never had to move away. But shit happend and i cant wish cos wishes dont come true.

Well yeah alex is here. Her and Samantha are here alot they are my cousins bestfriends...and i think thats the reason that my cousin is being such a fucking bitch cos she trys to show off in front of her friends and yano...i dont care what she wants to do but she doesnt need to get an attitude with me for no fucking reason.

Ugh..i'm not in a very good mood...i dont like not being in good moods and now i cant even fuckin go to sleep...cos my cousin has the light on and fuckin t.v. on. I'm so hungry there isnt anything good here eaither. i mite as well just go to bed.  actually i think i'll do so...well.nite*"

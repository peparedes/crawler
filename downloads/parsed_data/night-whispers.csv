"event","another song to add to the soundtrack of my life...

push me out from the darkness
to a sky that's colored blue
somewhere someone's finding happiness,
while i'm still here so hung up on you

nothing is real
and i want you to know
that i'm not alright
when you tear open my chest,
i'll try not to flinch.
won't make promises
you taught me that
i'm still losing what's left of my self esteem
and i'm still watching the slow fading of all my daydreams.

the hardest things to say are the words that mean the most
so i'll bite my tongue til it bleeds and i doubt you'll even know
the easiest things to fake are feelings to fool someone else.
and i've been tricked for so long by you that i spent these last few months in my own hell.

a failed apology,
a day too late but now i see
that all you really want's to see me dangle neck first from a tree
but what would you need me for
you've got friends galore

i could call,
but i know that you won't be there to pick up the phone
you don't have time for me
i could call but i know you won't get the phone
don't have time for me

i hate myself
for loving you like this
i hate myself for hating myself,
just enough to love you
just enough to love you."

now, when someone kisses my head like that...

"event","sometimes i wonder
why all the things you said
were only real inside your head
who where you trying to impress?
the answer is me, i guess
i never liked you for what you said you had
and all those sob stories only made me feel bad
you lied from the start
to get into my heart
but where it got you instead
was all alone in your bed"

"event","i see a few of the relationships i have in an entirely different light after this weekend
i've always been one to keep much of what i'm thinking to myself.  
every time i am and have been hurt by something or someone i build walls
that's just me
and i distance myself, to make things easier, for me
you see, it's all about me
and i find myself running to put in this distance
only to realize i've been running in the wrong direction
it's all a contradiction"

well, i don't think thats completely true for me.  
i knew what i had
i just thought i would be able to handle losing it

i never really intended to use this journal for much besides putting some poetry in it.
because i don't really like to talk about what is going on inside my head
but, its interesting how it seems so much easier for me to write in here because no one i know in person reads this.  or if they do, i don't know about it and they don't know its me

so perhaps if its okay,
i will begin to use this journal more often to express how i feel about things
it just might be good for me"

"event","all i can say is why
i won't pretend to understand

all i can do is tell you,
i'm here when you need me
always more than willing to talk,
or better yet, listen
while others are walking out 
i am walking in
we were never the best of friends
but we are friends
even if we don't see each other much
remember all the fun we had together?
catching fireflies,
singing in the rain,
bouncing balls across the street.
i do
i remember
but things changed, as they always do
and somewhere along the way,
we grew up
surprising isnt it?
but i don't believe we really knew
until a moment in time changed everything
when i found out, i cried
for you and for myself
for the innocence lost along the way
i believe we are both victims,
victims of that circumstance
and now, its too late to go back
i can never say what i should have said
that chance is lost forever,
just as yours was stolen away
i still don't understand
maybe i never will
it doesn't really matter now
although, sometimes...
sometimes i wish we could go back
and sometimes i wonder
could i have changed things?
and if i could,
would you have made it different?"

battered in the wind
rippled by the tide
has come once more
is once more enough this time
was it even enough the first
can it be salvaged
star crossed lovers it seems
always finding the wrong place
and time
our next lifetime 
might prove something more
something better
until then perhaps this is how we are meant to be
always exsisting with an outstreched hand
falling millimeters short of yours
always seeing but never really grasping
wanting more and getting less
my hand falls to my side
i look away and sigh
i can no longer feel you
it makes me empty inside
love still exsists
it was just misplaced for now
in this lifetime at least
what the future holds, no one knows
my only hope is one day to see you
reaching out
and that it is not to late
to reach back"

i used to be able to sense you
feel your thoughts
now i'm uncertain
it scares me to reach out
only to grasp emptiness
can you feel it?
the space between
our friendship was always so effortless
so unlike any other
always able to communicate
what mere words could never express
i feel as if that is lost
as if i've lost you
so i keep reaching into the emptiness
attempting to find
what we've left behind"

doesn't anyone hear
screaming to be set free
removing all expectations
and potential disappointments
removing these masks i have worn
is that way you cannot hear me?
these cumbersome masks?
beneath them you will find me
don't you want to see?
i need some help however,
the masks won't fall away on their own
they have been static for for to long
beneath them are the screams,
calling for help
by my calls fall unheeded
they fall with the autumn leaves
the crinkle under your feet 
is the remains of my call
buy you pay it no mind
you're far to used to the sound
so here i'll remain
behind these masks
until someone takes the time to see through
will that someone be you?"

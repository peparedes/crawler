"event","So, last night we watched ""Just My Luck"" which I think may have been the last film Lindsay Lohan appeared in before she went off the rails.&nbsp; I don't know if you've seen it but it's OK as far as those things go in a ""switch your brain off and just enjoy"" kind of way.

But it made me think about how in films, there's often a basic premise where things go out of control and bad stuff happens&nbsp; because the universe is unkind.&nbsp; UP TO A POINT.&nbsp; They go out of control just enough to allow a basic narrative and a bit of a morality tale.&nbsp; This irks me slightly because I have a bleak imagination and if it was me making the film I'd take thins a lot further.&nbsp; In aforementioned Lohan classic, she plays a girl for whom things always go well, until fatefully she kisses a really unlucky guy and their fortunes swap.&nbsp; In Hollywood this means that she loses her job, breaks a heel and gets a bit of an electric shock.&nbsp; If I was the one making the film, bad luck would REALLY be bad luck.&nbsp; After losing her job she'd go for a drink and end up getting Rohypnotised and then brutally sodomised by a psychopath with syphilis.&nbsp; Left in the gutter to rot, she'd be crushed by a falling sign and become a paraplegic.&nbsp; The film would end when, having just been allocated a motorised wheelchair, she ran over a rogue pigeon on leaving the hospital and careered into three lines of traffic, then to be beheaded by a truck.

In the actual film, she kisses the guy again, their fortunes swap once more, she gets her job back and then realises she loves said luck-vampire in time to once more swap fortune and enable McFly to wow a crowd of credulous knobwits.

In MY Hollywood things would be different, is all I'm saying.&nbsp; In ""Big"" a small boy makes a wish.&nbsp; ""I wish I were big"" he says.&nbsp; Next day, he wakes up as a kid in an adult's body with hilarious consequences.&nbsp; In MY ""Big"", he'd wake up the next day thirty times his original size, a tragic physical freak who had to go and live on marshland somewhere and befriend a kindly swan.&nbsp; Things would seem to be on the up, until he cuddled the swan, not knowing his own strength, and crushed it to death.&nbsp; Unable to maintain a reasonable diet he would slowly go insane, crash into a nearby town before eventually being taken out by the National Guard.

I'm beginning to understand why I got fired from that nursery school, I think."

"event","First entry of 2008.

Given the at times horrendous end to 2007, I'm fully intent on the new year being memorable for the right reasons.&nbsp; Disturbingly, this year I will turn 30.&nbsp; With that in mind, I intend to whinge a lot less.&nbsp; I can't complain about things going wrong if I've not done enough to make sure they go right.&nbsp; Not that I'm making any New Year's Resolutions, you understand.&nbsp; I have made only one - I will not make any binding commitments based on an arbitrary chronological starting point.

In 2007, I have felt the losses of numerous people for several reasons, some of whom I knew personally (rest in peace Ally H, you helped me in ways that I can now never let you know.&nbsp; Without you I may never have had the strength to see out the tough times when I first moved to Leicester.&nbsp; I feel a sense of anger that you didn't have more time.), some of whom I never met but admired no less (Benazir Bhutto and Phil O'Donnell, for reasons that vary immensely).

I can't dwell on the negative anymore.&nbsp; For the future, I want only to make a good fist of things, for myself and also for Toni - and for everyone that matters to me."

Losing a league title is always a shitter.  Losing it to Rangers is a hundred times worse.  Losing it to Rangers in the last three minutes... words fail me.  It's only football etc, but CHRIST.  Until next May, Rangers will be champions.  The blue hordes, with their songs about Fenian blood.  People who can't see just how WRONG it is to support Rangers, how much they represent everything that is vile.  If Rangers were a person they'd be Richard Littlejohn.  I HATE them.

OK, that's the steam blown off.  We lost the title, didn't deserve to win it, but that doesn't stop it being annoying.

In terms of recent happenings, here's a digest.

1)  Toni and I are off to France for the second time in as many months.  After Nice, Clermont-Auvergne.  A free house for the week, travel sorted, access to cheap fags and booze, opportunity to use the language.  Splendid.
2)I'm still at Halifax, still looking for another job so as to not be at the Halifax anymore.  I got a pay rise for hitting all my stat-based targets, which is a minor miracle considering how shit I am at the job and how unmotivated I am by the idea of calling people to make them pay debts.
3) I dunno.  I have a headache.  Rangers won the league.  Bastards."

A big-eared cunt and
A horse-faced demon-woman
Good luck to you both

(Andrew Motion, eat your cock off)

Matters of some import upon which to comment today.  Firstly, QueenMania on ITV1 last night.  For fuck's sake.  G4, Myleene Klass, Sporty Spice, Tony Christie, Lesley Fucking Garrett and Toyah ""Why"" Wilcox, doing songs by the band who did possibly more than any other to destroy music.  If I want to listen to shit renditions of shit songs played and sung by utter cunts, I'll buy ""Permission to Land"" (OK, an obvious joke, but if I had any measure of self-restraint then... I can't think of a punchline for that one.  Answers on a postcard to ""Finishing Paul's Jokes For Him Competition, Under a bridge somewhere"".

Next week it's MadonnaMania, with a similar line-up of wankers.  Though I do like Madonna's earlier stuff, her marriage to one of the world's biggest arseholes and her comedy rapping on ""American Life"" means I have little problem with people lining up to piss over her back catalogue.  It's a relief that most of my favourite bands and artists have either not been successful enough or not endured long enough to make ITV prick up their ears.  The most likely one, I guess, would be MozMania, where assembled fuckwits cover Morrissey and Smiths classics.  Gasp!  As Blue cover ""This Charming Man"".  Shudder!  As Gareth Gates stammers his way through ""There is a Light That Never Goes Out"".  Vomit!  As McFly work over ""Everyday is Like Sunday"".  Not to mention Il Fucking Divo's efforts with ""How Soon is Now?""

We're less than a month away from another comfortable Labour majority in an election.  Not that it fills me with joy to write those words, but the LibDems ain't gonna win it and nor, thankfully, are the Tories.  Helpfully, the Tories campaigned on behalf of Labour by having posters that said ""Vote Blair, Get Brown"".  90% of people thought ""sounds good to me, I'll take a couple more years of the Bush groupie and then we'll have the PM we want"".  Pete Doherty thought ""If they'll throw in some crack as well, count me in"".  I'm not registered to vote, so if someone who doesn't really care will go out and tactically vote against the Tories, I'd be much obliged (Toni's getting friends to vote Tory, I need to cancel them out).

"event","I got 54 out of 70 on the BBC Test the Nation Entertainment thing, which considering the amount of times I raised my eyes to the gods in bewilderment, isn't a bad score.  I'm not sure which ones I got wrong, which pretty much shows that is was more luck than judgment.  Having been a graduate for about nine months now, I miss standardised tests.  It was about this time last year that my finals were looming, and I began to wonder if study wouldn't be a good idea.  Ah, how I well up when I remember going through my notes.  ""Kassovitz's message in La Haine can be summed up in one simple phrase - Why is this lecture theatre so fucking cold?  It's 10 degrees Celsius outside for fuck's sake.""  Those were more innocent times.

Ireland's Grand Slam dream is gone.  Again.  Ripped to shreds by France, who were deserving winners.  The usual moment of brilliance from Brian O'Driscoll came too late, too many players didn't perform, and now to have any hope of winning the thing we need to win in Cardiff against a Welsh team who actually threaten to be as good as we thought we might be.  Fuckers.  Fortunately the sporting day wasn't a total waste as Celtic managed to knock six past Dunfermline (just remember, when we do it it's brilliance, when Rangers do it, Dunfermline are cheating liedooner scum).

And finally, a close friend of mine was today struck off the medical register for making unwelcome sexual advances towards a patient.  A real waste in my opinion, he was a fucking good vet."

"event","The SPL title race promises to be a belter this year.  The last time it was so close, we lost it on the last day, and I wish a plague upon the town of Fife due to Dunfermline's tame capitulation to Rangers on the last day (Kilmarnock's similarly tame performance against Celtic that same day poses me no such problems).  Rangers seemed to have it in their hands having beaten us in the recent Old Firm game and profited from a ""I-don't-reckon-it-was-impartial"" penalty decision to grab a last-minute winner against Hearts.  Mark Burchill equalised for Hearts that night, Bryan Prunty for Inverness Caley at the weekend to deny Rangers the three points and let us right back in.  Two former Celtic players.  With a bit of forward planning, we could have let Ross Wallace out on loan and sold Momo Sylla in order to wreak a bit more havoc on the Forces of Darkness in games to come.  Anyway, a fine performance against Hibs yesterday saw us win 3-1, with a particularly good game from Craig Bellamy (yeah, he's easy to hate, but anyone who has had a falling-out with Graeme Souness can't be all bad).  It surprises me to see Henri ""Disposable"" Camara playing so well for Southampton - he was shocking for us and I can only assume Simon has little love for him after his shabby treatment of Wolves, but I can only hope that he reverts to type and starts playing like a twat again soon.

I know, you don't give a fuck.

On Saturday, I arrived at work and braced myself to make outgoing calls from 8-8.30 - typically, people are a little put out by being called at such a time on a weekend to discuss why they haven't paid their credit card, but I'm contractually obliged to do that half-hour of telephonic hell.  What I shouldn't have to do is carry it on for another hour afterwards, which we were asked to do on Saturday.  Henceforth, I am genuinely looking for another job.  I know the idea of graduation leading to a rewarding, fun, financially beneficial job is an absurd one, but the soul-crushing, spirit-sapping misery of a Saturday morning as things stand has reached saturation point.

I'll still be doing it in July, won't I?

Still, I have tomorrow off, which means I'll actually be spending a weekday with Toni rather than getting up early, returning late and putrefying a little inside.  While my job isn't providing me with any fulfilment, the things which do shouldn't be held cheap.  That includes actually being there for my girlfriend once in a while."

"event","I received some sad news today.

Roisin, who was one of my friends on here (since December, we swapped the occasional comment on livejournal), died on the 17th of February.  She had suffered from anorexia for some time, and was slowly losing her sight.  While in contact with her on here, I never really had cause to notice because she retained a vibrancy and a sense of humour that any illness would sharply knock out of me.  And as I hadn't been around much since Christmas, I had little idea of the extent of her condition, save a few nods to it in her own journal.

Though I obviously can't pretend I knew her terribly well, I enjoyed reading what she had to say, I was impressed by how she seemed to think of others before herself (I've heard people refer to those with eating disorders as selfish, it always angered me, and Roisin was the clear disproof of that slur), and I wish I'd had a bit more time to get to know her.

RIP, Roisin."

1. Interviewed Bunf and Guto from the Super Furries, talked about Martin O'Neill, scabbed a glass of rather drinkable Merlot, then had the Minidisc player die on me so the interview was lost.
2. Cut off a caller to the Halifax credit card line because he had a stammer.
3. Been woken up by my girlfriend to watch the US election results while still in a drunken haze from an earlier football match, and shaken her off with the immortal words ""I can't help you without an account number"".
4. Worked for a ""practice firm"" - that is to say, an organisation that behaves like a real business, but all transactions are carried out on paper alone.  They had trade fairs and everything.  Funded by the government, I once spent a week in Lyon pretending to sell futons.
5. Built an entire lesson for French 15-year-olds around ""Dirty Old Town"" and ""Rainy Night in Soho"" by the Pogues.
6. Been born in Larne on the 24th of July 1978.
7. Gone to a rugby match in order to pull (it worked, the relationship has been going for over 14 months and counting now).
8. Informed radio listeners that Phil Collins had been mugged, and had got everything he deserved because he was an emissary of Satan.
9. Heckled an organist at my graduation (I did heckle very quietly though).
10. Written a speech that was given at the SDLP annual conference by my younger brother, who later that same night drunkenly berated political legend and architect of the peace process John Hume for reasons he can barely remember."

NO.  BAD.  NO!  For fuck's sake.  If shit musicians want to feel like good people, why don't they just retire and donate 50% of their inflated bank balances.  Cliff Richard?  Boy George?  Written by Mike Read?  And Ronan Keating will horn in on it if he can get to a recording studio.  All they need is to add Jon Bon Jovi and it will easily outstrip Westlife and Mariah Carey's cover of a Phil Collins song as the worst record ever.

Anyway, I'm in Larne.  Back home for a few days to see the family.  No internet in the house as they've just moved into a new place, so I've nipped out to the library.  It's unbelievably fucking cold outside.

2005 has started.  Don't think much of it so far - very few interesting trends have been set since the start of the year.  I spent most of yesterday playing Pro Evolution Football 4 on Brendan's Playstation.  I'd forgotten how much playing console football hurts my thumbs.  I'd also forgotten how shit I was at it.  Playing as Ireland, I lost 2-0 to the USA, even though I took the necessary precautions (dropping David Connolly).

I slept for 12 hours last night.  Flying from Luton to Belfast makes me so jet-lagged.

As though the repeated blip-verts for ""A Bear's Christmas Tail"" weren't annoying enough (seriously, why doesn't Leigh-Avid Francis-Merrion just fuck off already, the talent-free genital wart that he is?), they're now complicit in advertising the ""Crazy Frog"" ringtone.  What is its purpose?  Are they trying to compile a database of Britain's most idiotic fuckwits?  And if so, can they not just do it the same way the rest of us do - by looking at a list of subscribers to Max Power?

The Christmas spirit has got through to me, as you can see - just as well, because otherwise I'd be a seething ball of hatred.

For ShaneKatemas, I got Goodfellas on DVD, the U2 album, and the book of Fahrenheit 9/11.  Which makes me 33% cool, 33% honest about how uncool I am, and 33% anti-Bush.  There are many holes in Moore's analysis, but the key point is that Bush is a cunt, and criticism of him is to be welcomed.  I bought Toni the Trinny and Susannah book, Britney's Greatest Hits, and Thunderbirds on DVD.  I also have more whiskey than I know what to do with, including a 35cl bottle of Jack Daniels', which I plan to drink through a straw during a lunch break one day to show how big and clever I am.

I have decided that my New Year's Resolution will be to stop attaching significance to what date it is and allowing tradition to dictate when I make lifestyle choices.  Or to develop some humanity and stop being such a sneering little twat.  One of the two, I have yet to decide which.

"event","Not sure how to start this. ""Thought you'd got rid of me?"", ""Bet you didn't notice my absence!"", or ""Hey everyone, Joanna Lumley has AIDS!""?  So a passing reference to the fact that I haven't updated in weeks will suffice.  It's the only way forward.

My cat Smoki, a furry friend since childhood, died at the weekend.  She'd been ill for a little while, visited the vet who found a tumour, and on Sunday she was put to sleep.  I knew it would happen one day, I knew I wouldn't be there when it happened, but most of all I knew I'd cry like a bastard when I was told.  And so it came to pass.  Going back home for a spell in January is going to bring it home.  Yeah, so she's just a cat.  But she'd been around for more than half my life, and there's no point having pets if you don't love them and feel a connection to them - and when I sit on the sofa with a glass of whiskey and the remote and she doesn't show up to push my book out of the way and demand attention, that's when it's going to hit me.  I'm going to miss her.

All the usual Xmas songs are being played on the radio (and isn't that just the way? They remember the music, the presents, the food and the drink, but they forget about the man, born all those years ago, who gave his name to the holiday - Malcolm X) - the Pretenders, Bruce Springsteen, Slade, Fucking Chris Fucking Fucking Rea.  I still haven't heard the only song that makes it feel like the holiday is worth bothering with (Fairytale of New York - sorry to be predictable, but really, John Lennon and Jona Lewie (sp?) can fuck off, if you're going to do sentiment you have to get it right, otherwise you just look like a twat.  Mark Chapman reviewed ""Merry Christmas (War Is Over)"" more eloquently than I can ever hope to, with one pull of a trigger.).

I've been working like a Trojan (ie I have destroyed the entire computer network all by myself), racking up nearly 50 hours last week.  OK, so it's half what a student doctor works, but phone monkey work is all I can get now, and so I stack up the hours so I can buy stuff to make up for the fact that I'm 26, I've graduated, and I'm still no nearer to doing or even knowing what I'm going to do with my education.  The ambition to be a writer of some sort still sits on the horizon, where it will stay until such time as I can find the energy or gumption to do something about it.

But things aren't so bad.  I'm being domesticated with Toni, things are better with her than they've been for ages.  I've got three series of Family Guy on DVD, I don't hate my job anymore.  Celtic are still top of the league, Avid Merrion's plunge towards obscurity continues apace, I've bought some Mazzy Star off eBay.  Could be worse.

Joanna Lumley doesn't really have AIDS, by the way.  Not that I know of.

Until next time (sooner than this time)

"event","Three facts that I just made up:

1)  The name ""Darren"" is Swedish in origin.  It means ""bag of spanners"".
2)  Sanatogen Multivitamins are 93% cyanide.
3)  TV's Trevor McDonald is the only human being capable of unassisted flight.

How was my week, you ask (""you"", in this sense, meaning ""me"")?  It's been OK.  Most of Monday and Tuesday were spent in the flat, lazing around with Toni and doing some tidying.  And then back to work.  On Tuesday night I got very little sleep for some reason - possibly the large bomb I'll soon be planting in Leicester city centre (look out for that, kids!).  As a result I was zombified on Wednesday and managed to take a grand total of ten payments (you should be getting 20 to justify your existence).  We're given a script, and I daresay I could be accused of not sticking to it (""Your credit limit's been cut in half because you missed a payment?  Well, my duty as Halifax staff is to justify that, but frankly I can't.  I'll refund your late payment fee - I'd be livid if I were you"").  I've been improving my productivity by not getting up for a cup of coffee every five minutes, with the knock-on effect that I don't need to go for a piss quite so often.

Celtic managed to draw with Barcelona on Wednesday.  After the recent shaky run, a draw with the best club side in the world (currently) is quite impressive.  OK, we were played off the pitch and Hartson's goal was offside, but on the other hand I don't give a flying fuck.  We drew with Barcelona.  One more decent result (against Milan, granted) would get us into the Uefa Cup.  Possibly along with Real Madrid, which would be great in itself.

Anyway, buggering off."

So Bush won.  Four more fucking years.  Four more years of fundamentalists in the White House, misguided foreign policy, even more misguided domestic policy, of a world of ""us"" and ""them"", a world where Melanie Phillips can claim vindication for her pathetic rants, where Yasser Arafat doesn't need even to be buried before Tony and Dumbya start talking loudly about the opportunity his death gives for advancing the peace process.  Where people talk, without laughing, about ""compassionate conservatism"" which roughly translates as ""we're going to kill you and take your money, but we're going to pray for your soul afterwards"".  For fuck's sake.  Yeah, it's only four more years.  But he's got more of a mandate this time, having won the election without obviously cheating.  Watch him drill for oil in Alaska, shooting polar bears and laughing as he goes (This may or may not be geographically impossible.  I don't know.)

Where are the John Wilkes Booths of our time?

It's been a bad few weeks for Good vs Evil, as Rangers won an Old Firm Derby at only the eighth time of trying.  And they deserved to win too.  Celtic looked hopeless.  Sure, we've had injuries.  Sure, we'll probably win the next seven.  But it still rankles.  It's not how the world should be.

I won't even talk about my job here today, save to say that I hope not to still be in it for all but the earliest breaths of 2005.

The new flat is better than the old one.  The only thing that bothers me about it is that we hear nothing but loud bangs every night.  I thought grouse season was over?"

Passage to Hell secured, I may as well update on matters less paedophilia-related.  (That rules out the review of ""She Will Be Loved"").  US Election tomorrow night.  I can't pretend that John Kerry inspires me in any way - he seems to be Al Gore but with more guns.  However, I'm crying out for him to win tomorrow night.  The world needs to not be run by someone as swivel-eyed as GWB.  I saw someone on telly the other night dismissing Kerry as a ""consensus builder"", as though there was nothing worse for a person to be.  Exciting he ain't, but when put next to W, there seems to be little serious doubt that Kerry represents the best hope for some kind of normality in the world.  Bush came to power proclaiming loudly that he would put a stop to government meddling in the lives of ordinary people, yet under his administration meddling has increased by 200% (Statistic courtesy of me).  Opinion polls are worded along the lines of ""Do you agree that the government should be allowed to spy on you and harass you for mildly differing from them on issues of national security, OR are you a terrorist who eats babies?""

Not that I can vote tomorrow, nor would I expect to prevail upon my US-based LJ pals (I guess you guys have mostly made your minds up anyway), but I'll be watching tomorrow with Toni, talking about swing states and electoral colleges as if I have a fucking clue, with fingers crossed and remembering that, in the US, Blue = Good and Red = Evil.  Still confused about that one.

Speaking of spending part of tomorrow blindly hoping after lost causes, Celtic play Shakhtar Donetsk tomorrow, and more or less need to beat them by a country mile, with a defence that has conceded ten goals in four games.  Otherwise we could be out of Europe before the Forces of Darkness are.  This cannot be allowed to happen.

"event","A lot of people on my Friends List have already said something about this, but I felt the need...

Anyone in the UK (and many beyond) who has ever been an indie kid owes the man a debt of gratitude.  Most of my favourite bands have played sessions on his show and many were given their first national airplay on it.  To be honest I never liked a lot of the stuff he played, but after thirty minutes of impenetrable Japanese techno or extreme noise he'd play something that would remind me why I laid aside the Cranberries in the first place.  My early exposure to Kenickie, the Super Furries, and many others came from him.  A lot of the bands I love, past and present, would never have made it without him.

I switched on the radio by chance this afternoon, and two people were talking about one man's impact on the music scene.  It became clear that they were talking about John Peel.  Five Live, who have a stern remit to talk and not play music, then played ""Teenage Kicks"" as a tribute.  And despite my hatred of such cliches, I shed tears.  Too often, people talk about a broadcaster's ability to make you feel like he was your mate.  But with John Peel, I could understand it.

The term ""legend"" is overused.  But a legend died today.  RIP, John Peel."

"event","We're moving again.  Having lived for a while in a flat with scary fat men and uber-chav neighbours, Toni and I are packing up and crossing town to the Evington Road, which probably has as many chavs, but at least now our flat has a toilet INSIDE it, and a shower that you don't need to climb into.  Full address details will be posted when I have more of a clue what the flat number is.

One result is that we move from a Labour-held constituency (Patricia Hewitt has been my MP for four months, and I never knew) to a Lib-Dem one.  Parmjit Singh Gill, who's been on the front pages of the more broadsheety nationals, is now my MP.  I dunno if this will affect my voting intentions.  Wherever I live, I'll never vote Tory, UKIP, BNP or Respect.

I want to be doorstepped by a canvasser, though.  Ideally a BNP one.  So when he says ""Can I have a moment of your time?"" I can respond ""Yes, but I'm going to use this moment to beat you to death with this hammer and then skullfuck you"".  There's nothing wrong with being direct.  I want to see more political debates on British TV.  Not just between Blair, Howard and Kennedy though.  I want to see the more freakish parties up there, so that we can put paid to the idea that the BNP and UKIP are actually thinking parties.  I want Nick Griffin to espouse his poisonous views one more time, with feeling, and have someone else there to say ""You're wrong, and a cunt, and here's why, you one-eyed sex-criminal.""  It would make for good TV, at any rate.

Today, at work, we put into motion ""Operation Hat"" - which entailed us going about our job with the one key exception - we were all wearing hats.  It's quite a task to sympathise with a woman whose husband has just been made redundant while at the same time trying to stop your hat falling off.  But I managed it.  My idea of a practical joke - and you'll love this (if you are in fact as much of a dullard as myself) - was to answer the phone and, instead of saying ""Retail Bank Collections"", say ""Retail Hat Collections"".  This very nearly led to my sacking when I managed to say it without the customer detecting any disrespect, but then saw his name on the screen:  Mr Giles Tonkin, living at Gas Cottage.  Working in a call centre does bad things to your sense of humour.  I have to get out.

No, really.  I need a new job.  It pays no better than the job I walked out on to do my degree, it's got bollock-all to do with French, and it gets me no nearer to being a journalist or anything of the sort.  Plus I've completed training, so I think it's all going to be downhill from here.  Time to move on, explore new pastures, do something that doesn't mean I'm essentially Satan.  I have recently had the pleasure of phoning and asking for a customer who had died a week prior - and the person who put her number in the system KNEW that, and knew that whoever made the call would not know.  I had to apologise to the poor bloke who answered, knowing that I'd just made his day that bit more black and miserable.

And the trainers think I can <i>go far</i> in this job.

Nah, thought not.

So I've completed one week of training to be a collections adviser.  This has mostly involved team-building exercises and tests.  I failed two of these tests - Data Protection and Money Laundering.  So if you need someone to protect your data or keep your money dirty, avoid me like the plague.  I passed them on the re-sits though, obviously, I'm not a total fucking mong.

It's been surprisingly non-shit so far, I have to confess.  The training group (12 of us got taken on) seem mostly cool people, with the exception of one or two twats who feel the need to reiterate what the trainer has just said, subtly changing it by saying ""Yeah, you know?"" every three seconds.  When breaktime comes, I hang out with the smokers, because I've noticed that they're the ones who have a sense of humour.

Nice to see the Tory party is slowly dying.  Managing to finish up behind the United Kingdom Single-Issue Deformed-Chat-Show-Host Party - hilarious.  And the cunt from Fathers 4 Justice who poured cornflour over the head of the Lib Dem candidate, well, I just hope the guy gets syphilis and dies in incredible pain.  Still, fairly telling that he chose to attack the female candidate as opposed to the one who represented the government with which he supposedly has an issue.  Anyone would think the group were just a bunch of woman-hating wife-beaters.  If that's how the guy goes about trying to raise awareness of fathers' rights, he doesn't deserve to ever see his kids again, except on the occasional photo posted through their door, in which they are having the time of their life with a new step-dad.

Some people think I'm twisted.  They're all liars.

Anyway, yeah, about the new job.  We do have the interwebnet, but it blocks out certain sites.  One of which is Livejournal >:0 so my updates will be less regular than a fibre-deprived pensioner.  But it's not all good news.  He said semi self-deprecatingly, and then shut up."

"event","A curry house on the Narborough Road, near what where I live, has a framed article from an issue of the Sun, dating back to about 1989 or something.  It is a feature on the best curry houses in Britain.  Undoubtedly, having one of the best curry houses in Britain not ten minutes from my door is great news.  The black mark here is that the article in question was written by Garry Bushell.  I don't want to eat in a curry house recommended by someone who thinks all Asians should be shot dead on sight (I may be putting words into his mouth here, but let's be honest, the world would be a better place if someone else did Garry Bushell's talking for him.  Ideally a deaf mute.)  Quite apart from anything else, who can keep their appetite after looking upon the face of Bushell?  You'd be about to tuck into a nice biryani, and all of a sudden you'd be reminded that this very restaurant has housed a man (I use the term ""housed"" loosely, and the term ""man"" even more so) who has repeatedly called for more Joe Pasquale on national TV.  There's a time and place for Joe Pasquale.  The time, 1956, the place, Blackpool.  Anyway.  Garry Bushell.  Cunt.

I start work on Monday as a ""Collections Adviser"", which at least is a hell of a job title.  Sadly it doesn't mean I get the chance to advise people on what they should collect - ""Have you tried stamps?  They're great!"" - rather it means I have to see how much money per month people are willing to pay towards their credit card and current account debts.

""None.  At all.""
""Would you be prepared to negotiate that figure a little.""
""Leave me alone or I'll have you killed.""

Also, I have a giant overdraft with the bank in question that doesn't look like being paid off too quickly.  Is it possible that I could hack the system and make like it never existed?  Didn't think so.

Work was busy last night.  An entire hour was spent tidying up afterwards, which was helped by the head barman coming upstairs and saying ""Come on, hurry up!"" because of course we had wished to drag the process out as long as we possibly could, being as we are big fans of handling other people's saliva- and vomit-soaked rubbish.  The top floor was full from about 10.30 onwards, which is just crazy.  Normally until about 11 we get to stand around laughing at the sole person on the dancefloor.  The fact that I currently have a cough more troublesome than a crack-addled nine-year-old made for great fun when I stood to tell people how much their drinks had cost and instead showered them in germs.

Still, if I make them all ill, there'll be less of the fuckers next week.  Quite enjoyed my shift, all told.  I've even developed my own line of banter, which involves a lot of trying to persuade the customers to buy a less troublesome drink. ""Don't have Grolsch, you cunt, it's murder to pour"" - that kind of thing.

Anyway, my eye is itchy. x"

I've been dealing with benefits agencies (can you tell?).  First off, I went to sign on this morning.  Conscios of how far back in the queue they'll put you if you're a second late, I got there about 20 minutes early and read the paper.  I was seen an HOUR after my appointed time.  A fucking HOUR.  For money that's not even going to cover my rent.  I asked if there was any provision for people who got a job and found themselves waiting for income between signing off and getting your first pay.  ""Ask the employer for an advance"" said Cunto McFucknut on the other side of the desk.  Thanks for nothing, Cunto.

Then on to the Housing Benefit people who excelled themselves on this occasion by browbeating me over my failure to bring documents they hadn't requested.  ""I'll see your bank statement, tenancy agreement, passport and Jobseeker's Allowance documents, and raise you a letter from your landlord"" said Satan (OK, I am both paraphrasing and changing the person's name, but fuck it).  So now I have to phone my landlord, get a letter out of him saying I haven't failed on a rent payment yet (YET), and maybe if I'm a very good boy I'll get my money within three weeks, only a full three months or so late.

I bet any money that after Ian Paisley and his DUP brigade have been to Leeds Castle, they'll head to Westminster Abbey dressed as geese and protest about something.  That's the way it's heading, you mark my words.

Firstly, Fathers4Justice.  I have little enough sympathy for people who cause massive disruption, risking other people's safety and giving the excuse that they're not getting the chance to see their kids.  You're not going to see them if you're in jail either, you fucking mong.  Also, the one who was dressed as Batman has barely spoken to the kid he has by his current/latest girlfriend since he joined that bunch of psychos.  His other kids have had to take time off school due to the press coverage of this stunt, rather than inventing stomach cramps like we did when I were a lad.  But sod the deep reasoning, look at the name they've given themselves.  Fathers4Justice.  You're a pressure group, not a fucking mobile phone shop.  Grow up, you cunts.

Cuntyside Alliance next.  They're prattling on about intolerance and how they're an oppressed minority.  Oppressed minorities do not drive landrovers.  Foxes are cute. Fat landowners are repellent.  Hunting is ""pest control"", is it?  Do you dress like that to swat a fly?  Do you fuck as like.  People will lose their livelihood, eh?  Did you protest for the miners?  Did you fuck.  Who whinged long and loud about Foot and Mouth, and then got massive subsidies to take care of it, when they could have solved the problem with a) a simple vaccine or b) not illegally smuggling cattle into the country?  Yeah, the farmers - whereas the tourist industry got bollock-all to cover the money it lost thanks to the farmers' selfishness.

On the way out to the car with Toni, yesterday morning, and we see that she's been blocked in by someone else's twattish parking.  At a distance, I spot the fat simpleton who once gave me an earful for parking illegally and told me to move the car, not thinking that maybe I CAN'T DRIVE.  Thinking he might have a clue what was going on, due to his fixation with parking arrangements, I make to ask if he can help.

""Do you wanna know whose car it is?""
""Um...""  (bit sleep-deprived)
""Well, if you don't wanna know whose car it is, I'll piss off then.""
""Sorry?""
""They're parked there because they can't get in because of how you parked""
Toni interjects, mentioning how there are two spaces where another car could easily park.  The fat man isn't satisfied, as Toni walks up to check one of the two spaces.
""Another car's only just fucking moved.  You always park where you want, you're fucking selfish.""  This is patently bollocks, Toni always parks wherever it causes least bother, and she says so, also asking who exactly fatboy thinks he is.
""Flat 4.  It's Flat 4 who've parked there.  Go and ring the doorbell.  Go and bother them.""  This isn't verbatim, he also includes a lot of swears, and physically gives the impression that were we not separated by a wall he'd smack one or both of us.  As far as I can tell, he's got no official jurisdiction over the parking area, not that that's the point.  His obvious mental illness is what worries me more.  We live just above this psychotic cunt.  The first day I moved in, he was stood by the exit as I went out for a paper.  I smiled and said hello, wanting to be neighbourly.  Fatso blanked me.  I've spoken to him three times, once to be ignored, twice being harangued.  I think he might be Care in the Community or something.  Next time he gives me bother, I'm going to draw him into a slanging match until the inevitable strikes and he has a heart attack.

Tidying up was finished by about 2.20, which is insanely early, and Ed, Emily, the DJ (fucked if I know what his name is) and myself just sat there, taking great care not to go upstairs in case we got press-ganged into helping tidy the other bars.

Speaking of the Stereophonics, the DJ last night didn't half play a lot of stuff by their Australian equivalent, Jet.  I suppose you've got to play the crowd-pleasers, and Jet are mystifyingly popular.  This, however, cannot be allowed to cloud the issue.  I'm well aware that appreciation of music is a personal thing, and people are going to have different tastes.  However, Jet are just fucking shit and should be shot in the knees, then left to bleed to death while I watch and laugh.  Is that too much to ask?

However, and this is the point, the DJ redeemed himself with about half an hour to go.  One after another he played:

Angelica - Why Did You Let My Kitten Die?
Kenickie - Punka
Smiths - Panic
Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out

and although he followed these by playing something incredibly uninspired by the (Very Very Very) Ordinary Boys, the good work had already been done.  My love of girly pop-punk has been reawakened (it was never really dormant, and plus it was heightened by La Laverne being on the Music Quiz last night - she's stil unaware that she wants to sleep with me).  I've spent as long as my ADD wil allow trawling Amazon for Kenickie and Angelica stuff, and will be actually buying some of it when I can.  The combination of girl-punk and indie disco classics succeeded in cheering me up while my tired feet and shit customers battled to pull me down.  One bloke was particularly cuntish, practically whispering his order, taking about an hour to actually place it, being openly rude (he even barged in front of a few other people and practically put his hand in my face - I regretted not having the balls to blank him).  My revenge in the end was overcharging him by a pound and slipping that pound in my pocket.  Yes, if you're going to agitate barstaff, make sure you know what your round will cost, otherwise you may end up inadvertently tipping them.  I feel no guilt.  It's more lucrative than spitting in his pint (although I can't rule out doing that next time).

"event","Republican convention this week then.  How scary is it watching Arnold Schwarzenegger making a speech and <i>getting taken seriously</i>?  God, at least in the UK, Robert Kilroy-Silk, Arnie's co-novelty politician is a member of an impotent party whose hopes of running anything other than a raffle are negligible. Celebrities should know their place.  They exist SOLELY to act/sing/dance/present/model, then go on reality TV, then get addicted to heroin, then appear on a nostalgia show in twenty years' time.  They have no hidden depths.  The fact that I'm saying this because I'm in a bad mood in no way detracts from its validity.  And who cares that my knowledge of US politics only extends as far as wanting Kerry to win because:
a) GWB terrifies me
and b)  Kerry has at least one attractive daughter (this doesn't stop me liking Clinton, but sue me)?

Anyway, jobsearch continues.  I'm still, naively, only applying for jobs I actually want to do.  I'm still getting nowhere, although some companies have been more encouraging than others (writing to me to tell me they don't want me, as opposed to just ignoring me).  God, would inviting me for interview be that much of a risk?  When I watch TV, I learn that Michelle of Big Brother is a ""mortgage adviser"".  That sounds like it may require thinking.  So how come shit-for-brains like her can get a job and I can't?  I can do maths.  I can string a sentence together.  I can appear very nearly likeable for periods of more than ten minutes (occasionally). I even own a suit.

Celtic didn't sign anyone new prior to the deadline, but it could have been worse, they nearly signed Dwight Yorke.  What posessed Martin O'Neill to try and sign a player whose modus operandi is to score a few goals, become disinterested and impregnate a cretin?

Anyway, off into town to look at job prospects again.  Keep it surreal. x"

"event","Having carried out the important task of laughing at Placebo, I now turn to being more positive about stuff.  I finally saw ""Being John Malkovich"" yesterday.  And what a very good film it is.  Fair play to Malkovich himself, he could very easily have taken offence, but by laughing at himself he moved up a notch in my estimation.

Which put him at notch one.

It's stunning to think that Spike Jonze and Guy Ritchie have, effectively, the same job.  One makes jaw-droppingly original films, shorts and videos, and the other makes atrocious, masturbatory gangster films and promotes a ridiculous religious cult.  (I will confess now to only having seen the first 25 minutes of ""Swept Away"" - I couldn't take any more.)  The video for ""Weapon of Choice"" even distracts from the fact that the song itself is actually pretty piss-poor.  If I had any kind of creative mind whatsoever, watching Spike Jonze's stuff would make me want to make films."

"event","Anyone seen Brian Molko's hairstyle on the poster for Placebo's one-off gig somewhere?  Fucking Jesus Christ, he looks even sillier than when he grew that beard in 1999.  I know he's going bald and desperately trying to hide it, but the trainee werewolf look isn't the best way of going about it.

The poster, as well as providing me with a much-needed belly-laugh, contained some very good news.  ""Their last gig until 2006"", it trumpeted.  Like most people, I was surprised to find they hadn't actually splt up a while back.  Then they were mentioned in the press when Hut Records went bust and left them without a deal.

I have a hatred for Placebo which dates back through the ages.  Even though slagging them off is a little bit like tripping up a four-year-old (and nearly as much fun), I can't resist it.  When Molko wrote a song detailing how his treatment by the music press was like what the Ku Klux Klan did to black people, when he told his own fans to ""read a fucking book"", when he claimed that there was a conspiracy against Placebo (because they were ""dangerous"" and ""important"") - has no-one ever just grabbed him by the face and hit him with a hammer?  And if not, why not?  Christ, he never even realised that in this day and age it's not considered provocative to be bisexual, and pretending to be bisexual is a pretty dull way of gaining coverage.

Even now I'm giving them more coverage than they deserve.  But the positive thing is that they can't afford to tour next year, and I think that's cause to celebrate."

"event","Maroon 5.  Never was there a sounder reason for deafness as a lifestyle choice.  Music for people who don't like music.  A blander Red Hot Chili Peppers (something I had thought impossible).  And yet ... are they ever NOT on the radio?  I know, they're popular.  I know, most of my favourite stuff will get played on the radio about once a month (if I'm lucky) because no-one apart from me wants to hear the Pogues.  Why, though?  How did it come to pass that some radio plugger heard Moron 5 and thought ""They've got the X factor that makes a band great - let's make it happen""?  For fuck's sake, listening to them is like watching Iain Duncan Smith talking about watching beige paint dry.  And now they're Number 1 in the UK album charts.  Charts don't matter much in the scheme of things, to me.  I love the Streets, and even though ""Dry Your Eyes"" is a million miles off being their best single, I was happy to see it get to Number 1.  However, I'm resigned to the fact that most of what is popular will leave me either cold or incandescent with rage.  Maroon 5 are on another level entirely, however.  It's like the guy who manufactured them said to himself ""OK, what does Paul Kelly really hate?  Bland, middle of the road, adult-orientated rock.  But it needs something more... I've got it!  A singer with a voice that sounds like tarmac being laid!  Hire that trainee accountant we auditioned last Thursday!""

Maybe I'm giving it too much thought, but I've gone nearly 60 hours without a cigarette, and the swings are between delirium and apathy, so sue me.

Celtic have a bitch of a draw for the Champions' League.  Milan, the winners in 2002, and in my opinion arguably the favourites for the trophy.  Barcelona, who are up there as well.  And Shakhtar Donetsk, who we'll probably lose to in the away match.  Still, Rangers' failure to qualify means that we don't need to share the Champions' League TV allowance for Scotland with them this year.  Thanks, guys!

Now for Christ's sake, please let us sign a defender or two before Tuesday evening."

"event","I've stopped smoking.  Again.  No more setting fire to stuff and inhaling it.  I've done this before and it's not a whole lot of fun, but then again it's become all too frequent that I light up, and then just smoke the cigarette because it would be a waste not to.  More money, less tarry death.  I know it's the right decision, though my stomach disagrees.

Never mind though.  Celtic have signed Juninho and Rangers are out of the Champions' League, which is reason to laugh and point.  Old Firm Derby on Sunday.  I think the Celtic players should walk down the tunnel smoking cigars.  And female Celtic fans should get their right breasts autographed by Alex McLeish, then look at the signature and say ""That's all smudged, it looks shite - I thought you were used to signing right tits"".  And other stuff.

Working this weekend, from 10 both nights.  By all accounts it'll be really quiet, but if they try to send me home I'll chain myself to the bar.  I need the money.

Tired.  So very very tired."

"event","I've not updated this since the end of July.  It's now the middle of August.  Outrageous.  Someone like me, who has so much to say, so much of interest to the world at large, and ... ha ha ha ha ha.  I typed that with a straight face.

My last two shifts at Mosh are this weekend.  I'm going to miss working there.  The DJs play Jet far too much (ie. they play Jet at all) and they all have the same sense of humour, where playing the Distillers right after/before Rancid/Transplants is apparently the cleverest juxtaposition imaginable.  There are reasons they shouldn't do this.  Key among them being that all three bands are fucking shite and shouldn't be played at all.  But somehow, I just enjoy working at Mosh.  I have to quit though, because of the hours I am contracted to work at Asda.  I really did think that some other place might have contacted me by now, but I've had the grand total of one letter (of rejection - apparently I'm not good enough to work in an Estate Agency) so unfulfilling menial work it is.  I have no disrespect for people whose life is menial work.  It's just that I fucking suck at it, I hate doing it, and I didn't go to university so that I could work in a warehouse during the hours when normal people are doing things they don't hate.  Cock.

And I can't go to Summer Sundae because of the uselessness of Social Services, and the impending rent payment (still two weeks off, but let's be honest, how likely is it that I'll get Housing Benefit in time if they're more than three weeks behind schedule in getting my dole money to me?)

I never use livejournal anymore, and when I do it's only to whinge.  So I'll shut up and fuck off until I can be a bit more positive."

The illness cow has visited, and has left me with a bunged-up head and assorted aches, and given Toni throat problems.  Mine is the only flat in the entire Narborough Road area with so many legally-purchased drugs under its roof.  Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Sudafed, Beechams Syrup, Lemsip and Solpadol (it's wrong yet inevitable that that list went through my head to the tune of Feelgood Hit of the Summer by QOTSA).

I've registered with a doctor (I don't know who yet, but I'm sure they'll be sick of the sight of me by December), changed my address with the Halifax because I need to get a statement with my new address on so I can jump ship and bank with HSBC, thus changing my banking arrangements from ""with a shit bank"" to ""with a good bank"".  The grind of applying for new jobs (so I can actually put genuine money in the new account) continues.  So far, no-one's crying out to employ me.  All the companies to which I have applied are holding out against the realisation that they NEED me.  And I'm still waiting for a government handout despite having signed on twice.  A snotty man in the office parried my question relating to when I might see some fucking money with the response

""You and another 400 people made their claim last week"".

And he may well be right.  I CERTAINLY made my claim last week, because the inability of some people to organise a piss-up in a brewery meant that I had to rearrange my appointment twice, and even then they didn't give me the right forms.  Hell, I'd have reason to worry if my rent was due on Sunday (though I suspect they might take it out on Saturday, Sunday being a ""banks not open"" day).

Condensed point:  I don't have any money.  I want some money.  It's certain people's jobs to give me money.  Where is my money?

Many thanks to the birthday well-wishers.  I spent the day entangled in a furious battle to buy electricity.  The most sarcastic voicemail I have ever sent resulted in a return phone call with the FOURTH inaccurate code so far.  This could get bloody.  But the good wishes were very much appreciated.

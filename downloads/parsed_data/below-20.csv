"event","...i justwoke up and i'm tired. listening to music wondering what this day has in store for me...(knock on wood) yesterday was i'd say a bi-polar day or something like that. real low points cause of some drama and high points cause i kicked it with my homies. august 21 im gonna see my 48 buddies. so thats gonna be a lot of fun i haven't hung out with those guys in ages. we're all gonna go back to last summer and kick it and do everything we used to do. last night was cold...i started freezing when i got home. or maybe it should be that way winter seems to be my season anyway. people seem to be a lot cooler with each other, no drama none of that shit. well pace. i'm out. -ig

"event","From throat and eyes came winter and reasons. I'm told to carry on. Sad overwhelms my senses drown. oh I feel dependent The feeling that you weren't honest before I can't shake it. Make the same mistake twice, Flash of red and green all over me. Freeze the things that you love. Ash from what had formed all over. We count the days left, 21 And all I know Honestly, could I be protected With you suddenly gone? The feeling that you're really gone I can't shake it...

"event","so my boss got mad at tony and i cause we didn't go to the boxing gym. we explained to him that the trainer got mad cause we didn't have our equipment...yet again. but anywho i had fun yesterday i was so bored that i pretty much drank all day, didn't get drunk cause i would only end up falling asleep wherever i was at. i've come to realize that my friends and i aren't the same anymore, or maybe we never were to begin with. they don't make any plans, they don't like hanging out with different people, some are picky, some are submissive, i guess it's just a power struggle. but eh whatever. i don't get it. =\ or maybe these are my friends for the rest of my life. i just don't understand. i've met a few different people during these past few weeks and they are kewl peoples! unfortunately one of them is going back to school soon which really blows. well see ya -ig"

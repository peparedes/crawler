"event","oh so much has happened since the last time i posted! here's a readers digest of a few things that were most recent: 

am now not numb anymore from the dentist today. aunt rory came back from her trip unscathed. i came back from up north burned and pleased. had a pleasant evenign with katie and erica. had fun up north with the cousins. had plenty of funny, lovely, pleasing emails and phone calls with many people- some random and some not. went to ikea. got my hair cut. finally finished my bathroom. took part in a wonderful wedding. had fun at wineries/bachelorette party/ drove drunken 5 year old boys home from a bachelor party (or the acted like 5 year olds). worked my ass off the entire summer. saw several realy KICK ASS concerts. planned and participated in the Ficnic. started the new job. moved home. 

and i know i skimmed over the already skimmed summer, but there's just no way to sum up all the crazy life changing events that happened this summer. i mean every day we're alive and active something changes, does it not? our very existence itself in some way changes our path for the future. so needless to say, on goes life and on it goes. the new school year is already bringing tons of changes and im excited and anxious and a bit scared to actually have to face them all. in 7 classes, i'll have my ""piece of paper"" and i'll be forced to look into the real world. not just that but... well, so much more i just ... wow. jobs, locations, changes, moving, when does it all end? haha i dont think it ever really does. but at least i know im good at it! maybe that will be one of the consistencies :-P 

alright well im going to do something constructive with the time i have left here at home. tomorrow brings another day full of errands and ironing and packing my clothes. wednesday i come back to kzoo and to ty's house so i can gather the remainder of my stuff from there. Friday we move into 1108 Merrill! Saturday my parents come to get the big furniture from the mohney's house and bam, baby! new school year! ad club is already planning its first meeting with us e-board members... i have to fix my resume again. i have to call the registrar's office. i have to go to the doc's before i leave. i have so many little things i need to call on.... oh boy! my mind is just constantly swirling these days- among other things it's no wonder i hardly sleep restfully anymore ;)

ps- dinner was super yummy tonight... i almost wish i had gotten the coconut cream pie... but then i would have been sooooooo full"

"event","it's Aimee's 25th bday today! we decorated her cube and it looks snazzy!  The folowing list is from Tim a guy that works kiddy corner to my cube. not that anyone cares unless you tour the office. Anyways, these are hysterical pranks to pull in the office that ""may or may not get you fired....""


Photocopy an entire dictionary and fax it to the CFO. 

Call phone-sex numbers and transfer the calls at random. 

Write a coworker's initials in White-Out on the photocopier. 

Schedule a series of important departmental meetings and forget to show up to them. 

Send blank sheets of paper via interoffice mail. (Marked ""urgent"" and ""confidential"", of course.) Remember to send a few to the mailroom; they'll especially get a kick out of it. 

Replace a commonly-accessed file on the computer network with a scanned image of your ass. (An updated version of an old classic.)  

Adulterate other people's lunches: take bites out of sandwiches, sprinkle bacon bits in vegetarians' salads (also works well with Orthodox Jews), and spike the thermos of iced tea with grain alcohol. 

Set a mouse free in the office each day. When the problem becomes an epidemic, send snakes after them. 

Draw a flip-cartoon of a man running on the bottom of every notepad in the office supply closet. 

Hide in the supply closet and scare people when they open the door. 

When someone is at lunch, use their computer to e-mail a 200 megabyte database file to everyone in the company. The e-mail's subject, of course, should contain at least one vulgarity. 

Misfile. 

Hire a temp to do your job for you. 

Submit letters of resignation for other employees. 

Conduct all correspondence with your friend in the next office via Federal Express early-morning next-day delivery. 

Dial the phone number of the guy in the next cubicle whenever he walks away from his desk. Hang up before he can run back to answer it. Repeat often. 

Hire a stripper for the office Christmas party. 

Sneak into the conference room before the next major meeting and place nametags in front of each of the seats. Assign black people to one side of the table and white people to the other. 

Post a list of the communists in your company on a conspicuous bulletin board. If you're not sure who the communists are, take your best guess. 

Take a stack of resumes from the recruitment department and schedule some interviews for fictional, but high-paying, positions. 

See how many funerals in a row you can get away with leaving work early for. 

Wallpaper your office with pictures of Christ. 

And finally: 

Respond to every request by your boss with the phrase ""I would prefer not to.""

"event","i swear i got up this morning and these linen capris were only slightly big... but after getting stuck behind a train for 15 minutes and being later to work than i anticipated, they seem to have significantly stretched out even further. they're practically falling off me! what the fuck

argh. oh well, i'll just hope i dont have to do a lot of running around today... 

after work i have to go to the store, the tanner, eat a good dinner, go to the gym like crazy (maybe elliptical even), do laundry and start packing for this weekend. tomorrow night after work 4 of us are going out to celebrate Andy's last day, and I think we're going to his apartment too. hopefully his fiance will be able to join us! Nicole is supposed to drive down from EL but that's still up in the air. we'll see. 

Here's the schedule for the weekend: 
-Friday AM- drive to kzoo- 
-12:45- Tromblay nail appt-  *note, I need the new nail polish!
-3:00- check into hotel
-5:00- Stetson chapel rehearsal!
-7:00- dinner at The Black Swan!!!! 

-Saturday AM- head to Ultima salon to take pics of the gals gettin' ready! 
-12:30- Hans works his magic on my hair and does wonderous things for my makeup
-3:30- not sure how im going to get all of it done and changed by now, but I have to be at the church early! ack!
-WEDDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-Sunday AM- church w/ mom? 
-11:00-1:30- brunch at the young Mohney's house

-6:00- Summer Synchro Show 2006! ack! My babies are growing up!!!! :)  

-Monday AM- wish I had a week to sleep, but instead I go back to work


ps- let me just say that even tho there were several ""issues"" this past weekend, I had the freaking funniest time in Kzoo in a long time. Fritz/Grimm/Jackson and Clerks 2 on Friday night = hiiilarious and then driving ""The Idiots"" home on Saturday night = classic. I will never forget Kyle that night... I'm going to have to remind Mom to tell him next time she sees him about my father on his bachelor party. LOL that story is marvelous! 

Alright anyway, I'm going to go answer a few pressing emails and heat my lunch up. yum *rolls eyes*"

You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl

"event","this is an absolutely horrible, horrible day.

mom and i got in this huge fight last night and i cant even begin to put down what it was about. it was about everything. like literally.... i dont know, just everything. i went to bed at 1 after we were fighting and got up at 5:30 and was at work by 8:30 b/c i had to be.... to find out that the people who wanted me here early weren't even here yet .

so then i sat here for an hour and got more upset just thinking about my fight. then i found an email my dad had written to me at work while mom and i were fighting. my response to him just made me even more upset and of course im sitting here crying while people are coming into work. makes for a real fun morning.

then i go across to the building next door to drop off and pick up some hot stuff that of course always had a deadline of ""yesterday"", and the ass fuck print producer says to me, ""wait. i have all this crap for you.......and just so you know, if we have a day today like we did on friday, i'm going to quit"" ....like i can fucking do anything about the shitty day we had on friday. i didnt even know what to say to him! i just stood there like an idiot staring and blinking at him. i was so upset when i walked away i almost burst into tears again.&nbsp; then i come back over here and have to freaking run around getting stuff ready for the Goody's pitch today and get stuff for their meetings.&nbsp; when I just went back over to give Ken more stuff, tho not for what we were working on earlier, and I'm explaining what the status is of the other projects, he's like ""good, Julie's not here this week b/c if she was, I would have to kill her""

again....what am I supposed to do with this information? I like Julie, I dont want to know what his feelings are. I dont like Ken and he treats people like they are morons. Everyone is under a time crunch, he's not the only one who is stressed. I can't do my job any faster when other people dont have the work done themselves. why does he tell me this shit?&nbsp; I want to punch him in the face. 

no what i want to do is break down in front of him and all the other print producers... then perhaps he would take a hint. 

wednesday my father and I are supposed to ""talk"" about everything. everything that mom and i were fighting about. who the fuck knows how that's going to help, but we'll see. Until then I'll just worry myself sick over everything and probably do something to piss her off even more. Great."

"event","I should have said 3 meetings, but the first one was at 10:30 this morning, and I actually had stuff to do in between then and now. Quite a bit actually. 

So anyways, let's talk about the weekend. What a great time! Not only did I leave work early, and not hit a ton of traffic and only a little construction, but I had an absolute blast with peeps I haven't seen in a long time.&nbsp; Friday was absolutely positively wonderful- Fritz and Grimmy crack me up. I can not reiterate how much fun I had hanging out with them and going to dinner. The Knee Deep Shag concert was SO BOMB. I really think it's one of the best concerts I've been to in a long time. (I'd say, discount the Natives concerts b/c this is like apples and oranges)&nbsp; No X's on the hands, we got there and it wasn't crowded or smoky or hot, and the opening band was pretty good. It was super good to have Brandon and Dieneke meet us there, and even tho it was a bit weird having Barbie and Jessica show up (poor Fritz) it was fun. And talk about crazy- Neal, Jack, Paul, Jashe, and Walters! All of a sudden this hand grabs my ass, and another arm goes around my shoulder and I'm like ""uhhhh excuse me!"" but it was just them, so everything was fine :)&nbsp; I am confident in saying that everyone had a kick ass time. By the end of the night&nbsp; I was so hot/sweaty/smoke smelling that I just crashed on Fritz/Ballz's couch after my shower. I wasn't even gonna try for a blanket, except surprisingly, they had like 5 and insisted I take one.&nbsp; Go figure! A boy's apartment with extra blankets!! :0P 

I was awakened not by my alarm but by Fritz talking to his mom on the phone at like 9:30.. haha. Poor guy. Went to visit my favorite Kzoo tailor- Hassan, where I talked about (it's pronounced) Uudda and dresses. Uudda is a very potent Arabic alcohol, for those unawares. Hassan is a goof. 

Anyways, on to wine! Then, even tho the thought made me skeptical, wine tasting was very fun. By the 7th winery I was a bit.... well, done with it, but it was really nice to see those guys and buy some different wines. In my opinion we went to about 3 or 4 very cool wineries. Dinner was Olive Garden-licious, which is always good, and of course the fact I didnt have to pay for it was also a very welcome pleasantry. Dad laughed when I told him about Karma Vista and tho he's not really a wine drinker, thought the Pink Side of the Moon blush I bought was cool. I dont know that I'll let anyone drink any of the wine I bought.... maybe if they're nice to me :) 

Saturday.... again with the hysterical Ryan Fritz. That boy is .... wow he's a nut half the time. Marie and I went to his apartment and then the 3 of us bought tix for Pirates (the 10:45 showing!)&nbsp; and killed the hour in between drinking a beer at Branns. Real nice to sit and talk about vacations, sports, movies, whatever the hell we wanted. I'm actually still deciding if I liked Pirates or not. I know both of them had their reservations about the movie, which surprised me. But you know... the more I think about it, the more I realize I need to see it again. It was so much more complex in plot and characterization than the first movie that it's almost hard to make a decision based on only 1 viewing. Plus the end was so typical of ""middle movies""... it basically just ended and you sit there going ""ohhhh gawwwddddd"" b/c it's totally cliche ""LOTR"" second movie esque.&nbsp; Yeah the second movie was one long fight scene, and you knew it needed to happen in order to bridge b/w the first and third movies, but man, it sucked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

H'anyway. Marie's apartment is cute and I didnt even mind that she had to leave at 11:30 the next morning. I missed St. A's and that was my own alarm's fault, but I just totally snagged an asiago bagel w/ sundried tomato cream cheese from Panera and drove around for a bit. Decided what a better way to kill a few hours than to sit down at Ravenwood and drink some coffee. I expected it to be busy since it was a sunday after church, but nary a soul was there. In fact, I sat outside exclusively until like 1:15 when my phone call came and I left :)&nbsp; I read more of my AWESOME book and enjoyed my bagel and iced coffee. YUM!&nbsp; 

The drive home wasn't even that bad. ONly hit construction in one spot that slowed me down. then when I got home, I found out that Greats Uncle Sam and Aunt Marion were coming in for dinner. We had superb ribs at Aunt Rory's house and sat with them outside till probably 10:30 last night. It's always good to visit with them b/c so much of the time now is spent hearing how the remaining members of their generation are deteriorating health wise. It makes me sad. 

Alright well..... nothing much more to say except that:&nbsp; Aaron wants a jeep tho it doesn't have to be the $30,000 one, I say go for it,&nbsp; Melissa should redecorate her house if she wants to, Tim always finds the goofiest political things and sends them at the best times, James was alone the entire weekend (sometimes that's good, right?!) and Andrea is the best ever....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh, and I'm still chuckling over Kayla's comments ""that's the shit"" and about the whole running thing... haha ew gross"

set the scene:&nbsp; Mom's driving, I'm in the passenger seat, and Aunt Rory is in the back behind Mom. We're all talking and laughing about whatever...
AR [asks rather suddenly]:&nbsp; ""is the&nbsp;radio on or something?""
Mom:&nbsp; ""um, yeah, sorry""&nbsp;&nbsp; [turns it down]
AR [laughs]: ""oh okay good b/c I at first I thought there was a man in the back with us... like in the trunk or something""
Renee and Mom [laugh]:&nbsp; ""What?!""
Aunt Rory: ""well, all I heard was this low garbled sound! like he was talking!""&nbsp; [demonstrates noise]
Renee [laughs harder and turns around in seat]: ""in the trunk? are you serious?!""&nbsp;
Aunt Rory: ""Yes! And I thought he was going to come through the trunk at us, so I put my elbow up to push against the back of the seat.... so he couldnt come through the trunk at us..."" [demonstrates elbow]
Renee and Mom howl with laughter
Aunt Rory [laughs harder too] ""I was thinking, good grief I hope he doesnt come through here b/c I dont know how long my little old elbow can hold this closed!""



.... I seriously almost wet my pants in the car coming home I was laughing so hard.... I know I almost blacked out b/c I couldnt breath for a few minutes.... maybe you had to be there but just imagine Aunt Rory putting her elbow up against the back of the seat, like her arthritic elbow is going to keep a burglar from coming into the car! hahahah omg I'm still laughing just thinking about it"

"event","i went for a run tonight after work since i missed the gym. felt super good. havent done that in a long time and the night was absolutely perfect for it. <br /><br />so today the first thing i had to do today was (at 10:30 this morning) take Sara's american express visa, drive over to Lakeside Mall (my favorite, by the way) and go shopping. <br /><br />no i'm not shitting you. <br /><br />then i got panera salad for lunch. no not with sara's visa. <br /><br />then when i got back to work i did various things, got an email from a delightful girl who i think i might be awesome friends with at some point! i'm excited! i can't say as i've made a ""new"" friend in a long time! like, a friend from someone i totally dont know, not one of the girls that i'm working with from WMU. those friends are different b/c we share some connections. yay! Melissa is kewl and I bet we've emailed 5 times today. <br /><br />5 times esp since I was at work till 7:30 tonight watching dvds of the same tv spots over and over and over. what a pain in the fucking ass. *sigh* oh well. <br /><br />but anyways, after a deliciously mundane weekend, the week is half done already. good. i'm SUPER DUPER excited for the KDS concert friday, seeing Grimmy, Fritzor, Brandon, Dieneke, and anyone else who's coming to the show! woot! <br /><br />saturday i have to try my dress on, then go to the wine thing, then hang out with marie!!!! yay!!!!!! i havent seen her apartment yet, so my staying there is 2 fold good :) <br /><br />for now, good night! <br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Billy Joel why are you such a genius?! "">I've played this song like 5 times tonight while I was running... I dont know why I havent listened to it in a while. Shame on me.&nbsp; Well, here tis.&nbsp; I LUV IT<br /><br /><font size=""1""><strong>-Travelin' Prayer-</strong></font><font size=""2"">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></font>(Piano Man, 1973)<br />
<pre style=""FONT: 12px arial"">Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be.
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea.
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
And things are gonna be alright with me.

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet.
Said now, would ya guide her on the roads
And make them softer for her feet.
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me.

Hey, Lord would ya look out for her tonight
If she is sleepin' under the sky.
Said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry.
Ummm, don'tcha give her too much rain,
Try to keep her away from pain
Because my baby hates to cry.

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause it gets rough along the way.
Said now, this song seems strange is just because
I don't know how to pray.
Ummm, won'tcha give her peace of mind,
And if you ever find the time
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday.

Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be.
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea.
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me.
With me.</pre>
......if I felt more creative tonight, I'd give the lyrics a little switch-er-roo, but for tonight, I'm content to just sing it to myself&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp; :)&nbsp; :)<br /></div>"

"event","we went for a walk after Aunt Rory's big 'surf n turf' dinner, which was fab and I tried trout for the first time (very different from salmon, but i think i like both equally now).  well while we're out, random people were setting off fireworks. let me tell you, it's not the 4th yet, so either have a big damn show, or don't do it at all. At first it was like Oh okay...haha"" but then after 20 minutes it wasn't so cool

now I tried 2 new wines tonight, one red and one white. the white was a blended pinot grigio, and very tastey. the red was FAAAAAAAB. a blend of merlot and shiraz and chianti. *kisses finger tips* it was tastey. I would have had the entire bottle myself under much different circumstances, trust me. 

anyways, I came to the conclusion that strolls at dusk, after 2 glasses of wine are much better with the boy than the parents. not quite the same effect i was hoping for with them as with the boy. lol

here's a quote I need to remember b/c i think it's so cool. it was on the board at the gym the other day and i've been thinking about it ever since: 

""There are spaces between our fingers so that another person's fingers can fill them"" --Anonymous

I love that quote. 

Time for me to go clean up some of the wallpaper mess that's now at the top of my stairs and flowing into my bedroom. I can't wait till this shit is done. Tomorrow continues my day of doing nothing which will inevitably be consumed by a lot. the parents and i are going to Great lakes Crossing. Wooo."

"event","so so far this week i've worked 35.50 hours... i've driven to some guy's house in Walled Lake to drop off art work at his house (at 8:30/9:00 tuesday night) and i've ordered over $200 worth of food for people staying late to work. Let's see, I worked on Saturday from 6 to 9:30 and then I was told I needed to take something to a post production house in birmingham... by a snotty lady who is not the lady i usually want to punch in the face. she's another one. 

but today is Thursday, and I'm happy. I got out of work yesterday ON TIME! and went to the tanner, and met mom at the gym. Tonight, if all goes according to plan, I'll be leaving on time again, and will go to the gym again to make up for my lost time. Tomorrow, I will repeat the process, altho several of us are covering for Tim who will be standing up in his sister's wedding! Then also tomorrow is Jeff's last day and I just got an email about people meeting at this pub downtown Dtown at 11pm. Old Shileleigh. Sounds like fun! It's right around Greektown and I've always wanted to go, so since it's 25 minutes from my house, I'll try to go! woot! 

oh boy, i just got another email about next week covering for jeff's accounts since they dont have a replacement for him yet. Whoopie. That'll be great fun. Hopefully everyone else will pitch in too since they'll need to train Jeff's replacement. Man Doner really f*ed it up this time since Jeff's leaving before his replacement is here! 

In other news............. maybe Lisa and Rachel will want to come out on Friday too! And I miss Katie, Eileen and Marie. I havent seen them in a LOOOOOOOOOOONNNNG time. It's weird not having them here this summer! It's weird not working at the park this summer! AGH I miss the synchro girls and coaching. I look back on it fondly, tho I wouldnt want to put the show together again. Just a little session every once in a while would be nice.&nbsp; :0)&nbsp;&nbsp; I also miss Kzoo people and hanging out with them.&nbsp; I can't wait for the KDS concert and I have a feeling crashing at Fritz's appt. will be hysterical. As long as he doesnt make me was FMJ, I guess I can't complain. If Marie's in town, perhaps she'll want to go to the concert with us and then I can stay there :) haha not that I dont want to crash w/ Fritzor, but I haven't even seen Marie's apartment yet!

BUH. that reminds me of Laura Peters. I havent seen her either! :0\ I wonder how her Arin is doing. I hope things are well with his study abroad. 

OOOOOOOOO&nbsp;&nbsp; I just remembered that I'm on my own for dinner tonight! The Gunyon's (friends of the family from GA) are in town and called my parents to get together with them for dinner. Okay this is totally awesome, check it:&nbsp; Mr. Gunyon (guy my dad is going to ALaska with) bought Mrs. Gunyon a special edition 40th anniversary corvette for her bday!!!!! how fucking sweet is that!?! it's kinda a deep purple, I'm sure it's super hotttt. apparently some guy Mr. GUnyon works with owns all these toys and cars and stuff and keeps things in mint condition... he was selling some stuff b/c his wifed wanted to clean things up, and so everyone he worked with was getting dibs on stuff if they wanted. Mr. Gunyon immediately was like ""I want that car"" .. haha! Damn!!!! They are so cute and sweet! I hope a certain so and so takes some hints from them.... I could see myself in a corvette....

haha im going to the Reg Office b/c I just got an IM from cheri. THey're having a carnival and a potluck today! I miss them too!!!!"

"event","it's an absolutely gorgeous day out, sunny/bright, nice moderate temp, breezy.... and heads are going to roll. I seriously think someone is going to be murdered by the time this weekend is done. I am in just a horrible, foul mood, so part of me suggests you stop reading this right now. 

I believe it started yesterday at work when I got an email at 10 in the morning asking (but really telling) several of us that we needed to come into work today. Well excuse me, but we have plans made on our weekends and can't just drop everything to come in to work. But just why do they really need us to come in? Oh to make sure there's food. Fuck that, bring your own food. I know from last time I'll have to make sure they have dinner *insert whine, whine, whine* and sit around waiting for someone to say ""here we need copies of this... here we need this printed out..."" blah blah blah bullshit. The other thing that pisses me off about it, which is really the kicker, is that we have a family graduation party today! I'm so fucking pissed that they are expecting me to just tell everyone at the graduation ""uh yeah I'm sorry but i have to go to work"" and blow it off. No way. BS. Aaron and his older brother Christopher and I have grown up together; their parents and my parents were best friends. I'm not about to say ""fuck you"" to them when they were at my party, etc. I guess it's the mere thought that this woman, Susan, whom I really can not stand, is so fake with me. I had to call in to her today to ""check in"" and she goes, ""Well, I'm in a meeting right now, but we really need you here Renee... there are going to be people here working until 8 or 9..."" I'm like ""yes, I know but as I said yesterday in my email to everyone, we have a family graduation party that starts at 4 and dinner is served at 5.... I can order you all pizza and be there around 6 or 6:30, but that's all I can do"" and she got all breathy and huffy. She was like ""well call Carmen and see if she can stay late too... have fun at the party"" in a very condescending voice. Lady, you are seriously asking for a punch in the mouth. 

On top of that, yesterday as I was coming home from work, my car ran out of gas. There's a gas station at the corner of 8 mile and harper that I was planning on stopping at.... but I didnt make it obviously. What made me even more upset b/c I had just gotten off the phone with Mom and told her I was stopping there before I came home. She had also just told me that the 50-60 people I thought were coming to the picnic on Sunday had now gone up to like 80... which means all the budgeting and planning I had done for food was shot to hell. It ends up basically doubling what I had calculated on, and we don't have near enough money right now... so people better plan on paying us at the park when they get there... there is no way in HELL I'm eating (the expense of) $300 worth of food we had to buy for everyone. 

*sigh* the other part of it I know is that I feel like absolute crap. My back hurts, my neck is stiff, I have horrible cramps and my BP is up down and all over the place. I should be feeling more myself in the next few days, but hopefully I'm starting this new medicine and I won't want to murder people as much. 

Poo. My only saving grace will be that I'm bringing jeans and t shirt with me and changing out of my dress at work so I dont have to sit for 5 hours at the office in what I was wearing to Aaron's grad party. *harumph* 


anyways, I hear the first batch of wash is done, so I'm going to continue with the soul- smiting... Aaron's not here to do it, so I figure since I'm in that kind of mood, someone has to keep up with it. 




The thought keeps popping in my head...seriously... is it bad I want to bitch slap that woman at work???&nbsp; :-P"

Tomorrow is the Expedia.com New Biz meeting! This means that reels are being made today with important spots... and we just got a company email asking if we'd all clean up our ""personal areas"" around our desks for the tour tomorrow....&nbsp; I am thinking that I should wear black pants or maybe black capris tomorrow. I was def planning on not wearing jeans, but since it's new biz and I'm sorta the ""new biz traffic intern"" then I should be prepared. Thankfully no one has told me I need to go to a meeting or anything *phew!*

Last night after work, I met my cousin Melissa at Party City and we bought a few things for the Ficnic on Sunday. We also got pricing ideas, and it looks like most of our plates and stuff are coming from Costco. Thank God for bulk items! Woot!&nbsp; And who knew that Tupperware parties were so much fun! I got home and our driveway/street was full of mom's friends and some of our aunts and cousins. Some of that stuff is pretty damn sweet! I was kinda eyeing some of that stuff... cool bowls, a really cool chopper thingy, and who knows what else. I had visions dancing in my head, and that totally made me feel like I was married with a house. haha&nbsp; Not unwelcome, I assure you. 

I heard a spot of ""And the whistles go WOOOOOOO"" on the radio the other morning driving to work and it reminded me of Dan. I busted a gut in the car in the middle of 8 mile and I was glad I had the windows up.&nbsp;&nbsp; :0P 

Also: special note here! My M&amp;Ms are Pirates of the Carribean!!!! They're so cute! They're red, green, navy blue, and purple! And they either a plain M on them, an M with a hook coming out of it, an M with a hook actually hooking it, and an M with 2 swords crossing, skulls, spy glasses, and compasses!&nbsp; Adorable! 

Tomorrow night after work is this ""Adcraft PM"" thingy. I'm not sure what it is really except that different advertising people from all over Detroit and metro-D get together at the bar and have fun. Sounds like a good time to me! :) 

This weekend's gonna be busy as shit. UGH. but fun... toodles for now, time to go get some boards from upstairs!"

"event","so this week... one of the most intense weeks I've had since I left school. Rather disconcerting at times... well pretty much the whole time. But still, it's over and here I am, alive and healthy and happy (usually) and thankful to be so. 

let's go over what happened, shall we? I was covering for Brian all week and I was busier than ever. It was absolutely insane pretty much all of the time. Not only did his stuff require constant attention (none of which I knew anything about so I had to make it up as I went along) but I also got swamped with my own ""new business"" stuff. Apparently we're having a lot of new pitches soon b/c what normally would have been a fairly steady amount of work for me turned into like.... super highway, carpool lane, cruise control at 90 all week. I hardly had time to check my emails, no time for live journal unless it was in the last 30 minutes of the day (once), and not even time for lunch sometimes. *PHEW!* 

Also, really randomly, I felt super sick on Tuesday. Woke up with it and it just got worse throughout the day. I came home at like 6 from work and immediately went straight to bed. Bad stuff. 

And, to make matters worse in my mind now, I didnt know that Katie Parfitt's Aunt Marge died on Tuesday night! No one ever called us, tho we knew she wasn't doing well at all and the end was pretty near. I'm sure it was busy for them, but I found this all out last night as I was coming home from Royal Oak. I called her by chance to tell her I was kidnapping her from MSU and she was coming to the Natives concert tonight, and she was like ""uh...well... I'm home right now"". Needless to say I kinda freaked out in the car on the highway- I wasn't mad at her for not calling me, but I was disappointed b/c I was home and drove around GP on Thursday night. I even went and got a shiver and it made me think ""gee too bad Katie's not home right now"". I could have gone to the wake, or over to their house... *sigh* oh well. The Parfitt family knows how we feel about them. Aunt Marge was a wonderful woman who was in a horribly, excruciating amount of pain for so long that this was really a blessing. She passed away Tuesday night after she was able to say goodbye to her husband and kids. I think she was very lucky for that. 

Switching back to work, by the time I was done, I was ready for a drink yesterday. I met Crall at this yummy noodle/pasta place in RO and we had a wonderful time swapping stories about work, family, boys, whatever. haha My cousin Tony called me and came out and met us for a minute or two after we had migrated to a martini bar- Goodnight Gracie. Very good! Very ecclectic. We left there 2 martinis each in our systems and walked around Main St. for a bit. I got myself a coffee on the way home thinking I'd go home and read and sleep. Then I called Katie and immediately drove to her house and made her put clothes on and took her out again. We just went to the Tap Room and I bought her a Jack and Coke and we sat for a bout 2 hours there. Then as we were coming home, we saw our friend's older brother and offered to give him a ride so his friends wouldnt have to go out of their way. We probably stood and talked to them for a few hours too. All in all a relaxing evening and I think one that Katie appreciated. 

And lastly, surprise! surprise! I find out that A. my grandparents are coming up today, B. that Natives are pretty much moving out of Michigan and to Cali to try and make it big, and C. I find out that Aaron's truck was hit with an IED. Not to mention the fact that I simply read a line about it, never heard about it from him when he did in fact email me, and it was at like midnight so I couldnt even ask anyone about it. Thank God he is uninjured. As I see it right now, his explanation that he didnt want to tell me by way of email, esp when he wasnt sure if I'd read it at work etc, seems logical and practical and extremely thoughtful. As I do appreciate the sentiment it was duly noted and expressed, but frankly wasn't the way it should have been handled. He knows that now and I know I'll hear more about it in the next few days.&nbsp; As we both agree, it's not the type of thing you dont just tell someone. Honesty and truthfulness and respect are 3 elements which are usually nice to have with someone.&nbsp; 

time to go wrap dad's gifts and such while no one is around. i think i'll listen to one of my new cds... the week just gets weirder and weirder. good thing tomorrow is sunday."

I'm very intrigued as to what the hell is going on... did I miss some sort of Chinese holiday? Perhaps it doesnt apply on the western half of the state... 


OH, and I'm having dinner on Friday night with Brandon Crall and I'm so excited I can hardly see straight!!! *beams* We're going to a place in RO (Royal Oak) called Noodles &amp; Co. I'm gonna meet him there after work around 6 or 6:30, so hopefully I wont have to stay late. I know I might have to tomorrow night, so I'm hoping that'll do it for this week. *phew* It's been far FAR too long since I've seen Mr. Crall and he's recouping from his last surgery, so celebration is in order :) 

Work was not too bad today- steady and busy the entire day. I hope I successfully averted as many crisi (plural of crisis, right?) as possible. Tomorrow is another day, so we'll see what that brings! So far everyone on Brian's account has been super nice about me covering for him and not knowing anything about anything dealing with his accounts. Let's hope it stays that way for the remainder of the week! 

*happy dance* 

Brandon cracks me up. For some reason since I was signed on here at home, it only saved his part of the conversation from while I was at work. Here's his portion (I'll try to add in what I said too): 

mrathrope: work is driving me crazy though 
mrathrope: some people there are going to put me into a 12 step program. 
mrathrope: i just had to get loud on the phone during a meeting. it actually got to the point where someone else started to talk while i was talking and i said ""excuse me bill, i'm not finished"" (his name is actually bill) 
Renee: whoa! YOU!? for you to get loud is saying a lot! 
Renee: i can just hear you! 
mrathrope: but it made me so frustrated i had to take two vicodine 
mrathrope: now things are getting better 
Renee: hahahaha omg! 2 vicodines! that would KILL me! 
mrathrope: eh, it just make me smile 


Renee: you can be my hero 
mrathrope: right right 
Renee: well, you're already my fav. so what's next? you're already a bigger queen than I am 
Renee: actually, I'm more like a princess 
mrathrope: lol. thanks 
mrathrope: (as i adjust my tiara) 
mrathrope: or should i say crown 
mrathrope: lol....i love me 
Renee: hahaha I do too 


lol that man.... alright time to go with mom to pick up the only chinese we could find! it's so ""far away"" that I have to go with her... *rolls eyes* it's down by our old house, please."

Too bad I'll be in downtown walking in the Race for the Cure :) that's fun too tho. Also, that guy from the tailor called me and said that he rescheduled the dress fitting for the 16th... uh, I didnt know he had scheduled one in the first place! And I can't come on the 16th! hm... I can't come the next weekend either b/c that's the Ficnic! The first available time I can come is the first weekend of July... if I come back to Kzoo then, then I will be in kzoo July 1-2, July 7-8, July 21, and July 28-30. Fuck. That's insane. That's a lot of fucking gas. That's a lot of fucking money Period. The tailor is gonna be freaking expensive. *SIGH*  we'll see...

sometimes I also wonder if I'll make it next week covering for Brian all week on his accounts while he's gone. *GULP* And now Mike is gonna be gone next Friday too. wow. And they just added me to another new biz account- AAA! I had to send a ""deck"" out this morning to a production house to make color copies for like 5 people since it's gonna be expensive and time consuming for me to do myself. I hope that was good. We'll see. It seems like it's not unusual but no one ever told me the procedures...

Last night was hella funny. James, Hyphen, Matt and Alan were hysterical. Actually, Firefly was hysterical! :) That is one of my new fav shows! Too bad it was only on for a season... good thing they have the DVDs and we can watch them over and over! I think the move out of the apartment will be good for James and Chels. That thing is freaking falling apart. James says his stuff is mostly packed, but it was not obvious to me... hehe oh you boys and your packing/cleaning skills! This puts me in mind of the many events at the House on Euclid... 

PS- James, I honestly cant see why Chels wouldnt like the show! Maybe it was the humor or something ;) I CAN see why you guys all like it tho.. it's right up your alley in terms of wit and dry humor. Nashi is adorable, and she doesnt even cry! I heard her purr and it sounds like a motor :) 



Okay so I just got a call from the guy at the production house my stuff went to. Sounds like everything's going well and I'll have the stuff back soon! yay! I was worried I'd have to stay late tonight b/c of it. Tonight I'm gonna stop at the gym out here on the way home, then I need to do laundry. Tomorrow I'm going out with Mom and Mrs. Tocco and her daughter to a jewelry party! weee!"

"event","so I drove to work today with much trepidation b/c of all the crap that went down on Friday. ugh. Well it appears to day should be much better *phew!* I've already had a few things to do and I think I might help Amy later on on finding research about ""failed ad campaigns"". I wonder if any of my old Ad books from school have stuff on that in there? Hm.........perhaps I will look tonight! 

As for the rest of the weekend, OMG Mary's baby shower was SO MUCH FUN! My Aunt Susie was there and no one knew she was flying in! It was so wonderful to see her, she's such a trip and a half. She's from Houston, so we hardly see her family at all b/c it's hard for them to come in, esp her. There were only a few of our cousins and aunts at the shower; mostly Mary's friends from high school/college and work that she keeps in touch with. Still, there were about 40 people there. That just tells you how much family we normally have at our showers and stuff! haha  It was really cute to talk to some of the other aunts and cousins too b/c most of them have grandbaby or daughter/son stories now. WAY CUTE!  Aunt Susie was mad Aunt Rory wasn't there and told me that she went to Kentucky out of spite. haha right. She also said that she missed me and she wanted me to come live in Houston- there are good job opportunities and it was warm and I could see them any time I wanted. I seriously burst out laughing and Mom goes ""well that's more possible than you think...""

So after 2 glasses of wine and a really long week, I was sleepy when we finally got home. It was like 10:30! I felt like a grandma, but while I was waiting to hear from Katie about where they were for Courtney's bday, I was definitely falling asleep. I remembered about 11:30 that I was house sitting for Aunt Rory so I grabbed jammies and went over there. About midnight I said ""fuck it"" and got in bed with the TV on. I think I silenced a call around 12:30 and was probably asleep like 10 minutes later. It was so weird. 

BUT. I got up at 7:30 on Saturday to take my car in. YEP. $740 and about 6 hours later, I had a new brake system in my car. Oh boy that was something I wanted to do. But Dad actually felt really bad b/c he thinks the brakes have been going bad for a long time and he didnt do anything about them when I said it before. So he paid. Too bad I feel slightly guilty about that. 

Other good thing about the weekend: Mom and I went shopping and I got some new capris for work. We also bought Dad some stuff for Father's Day so we're actually ahead of the game on that! Plus, I finally found awesome wallpaper for my bathroom! yay! Slightly vexing is that I thought I'd get a ring Sunday night and it never happened. *frown* I know things get busy, so whatev.

HEY and who would have guessed about Saturday night? haha Rachel and Katie and I went out to 2 local bars- the Tap Rooom and Excalibur. oh man... some guy named Scott Gallacher (yes that's his name... not Gallagher thankfully) came stumbling over to our table about 30 minutes after we got there and would not freaking leave us alone. This dude was so drunk I thought he was going to fall on our table. Then his friend John (never bothered to find out his last name) came over, and seemed slightly embarrassed of Scott, but didnt really try to corrale him back to their table. So instead of Katie, Rachel and I having a chance to catch up and socialize, we spent the entire rest of the evening making polite conversation with these 2 drunk guys. Literally we were like ""hahahaaaa..yeah..uh... right... oh sure... "" the entire night. Ugh. it was amusing at times, sure, but not something we had planned on. I was glad that I drove b/c Katie was what I dubbed ""bumbly drunk"" and it started raining pretty hard a few minutes after close. She was all giggling when I dropped her off :) And Rachel was pretty worried about her brother, and she didnt really drink, but she didnt have her car. So yeah, anyways, it was nice to stay sober enough to drive and keep tabs on everyone  :) 

I just chatted with Andrea for like 20 minutes- clearly neither of us have major account issues today. That's good! :) But I will go see if Amy wants my help yet or not.

it's insane today! 

i seriously went to wendy's at 1:00pm and picked up a salad (and a frosty b/c i wanted it damnit) and came back here and didnt&nbsp; even get to sit at my desk to eat it.&nbsp; i mean i did, but i ran all over the place and ate it in between. i seriously think i ate it around 2:30pm. WTF 

and it's not like this was any of my stuff to work on. Barb asked me and another girl to cover her today b/c she was assigned to go out and do research for something... whatever. sure i say. Barb assures me it wont be busy... OH BOY was she wrong. there were nothing but problems with this video spot project since I got it at 11:00 this morning! it was just insane. it's 4pm and we're just not maybe getting it to work. i feel really bad. the client wanted it by 2.&nbsp; :(&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I sent the (an external company) production house about 5 emails with these attachments and they didnt get any of them! and they also didnt get another email from jeff, who has emailed them before. I dont know how they ended up getting them, but they must have b/c they haven't called me in the last few minutes... 

I'm taking that as a good sign. 

Anyways, I've also had my few things to work on for Expedia, so of course I'm trying to do that while handling Barb's stuff. I think I'm good for a few minutes with that tho. In fact, I think I might go take stuff across the street again b/c no one else has gone over today (basically) except me. I'm worried that if I dont go over now the readers next door wont get routed back in time. ACK! what do I care?! They're not even my accounts!!!!! 

haha I need to chill. Mary's baby shower is tonight! yay! my 3rd cousin to have a baby, and I just found out that my other cousin (on my dad's side) Sophia was proposed to on monday! so exciting! She and Ted might get married next Memorial Day weekend.&nbsp; That is so great. She was so giddy on the phone the other night when she told me. LOL she was like ""well? when are you?!"" I laughed and told her not for a few years.&nbsp; I need to get some experience in a firm first and figure out if I can actually get a job in Michigan or if I need to move. Not to worry, I think my future husband will understand ;)&nbsp; hahaha

Anyways, I think tonight after the shower, I'm gonna go hang out with Rachel and Lisa and Rick and drink a few. Last night at dinner, I had a Killians and it tasted wonderful. Mom and I went shoe shopping a bit and I found 2 cute pairs that were on sale. yippeeeee."

I'm sure to cover all my bases by the time the day is done...<br /><br />So, so far today, the power went off yesterday causing our computers to be shut off last night, Novell (the email system) was on the fritz for a while this morning, a new Muse&nbsp; cd is coming out, the lead from Radiohead is going to release a solo album later this summer, Carmen got word that all the boards we were told to bring downstairs yesterday had to be brought right back upstairs, and I went to help Andrea box up some films for shipping and we ended up spending like an hour or more in the mail room. I do declare that I've spent more time in the mail room today than I have in the last week! And I'll probably be spending more there later today....&nbsp; Boy! it's been random today! Oh wait. Just kidding, one more thing. We probably need to make another binder today, which means I'll have to do it right away b/c I can't stay late tonight b/c of my doctor's appt. Hm. <br /><br />Although I've already gotten a phone call from a credit card company (who I told in no uncertain terms how the hell did they get my number and take me off any lists they have) and from the doctor's asking if i can come in early. Hm. let me just see if I can leave work in the middle of the day. Riiight. <br /><br />*shrug* With the way everything's been going, who the hell knows what's in store for the rest of the day! <br /><br />Here is a funny quote from Brandon Crall that I keep wanting to say here at work but haven't found a good opportunity: <br /><br />
<pre class=""WMmessagebody"">[14:42] Brandon Crall: oh no problem. we are both at work. it's part of the <br />process<br />[14:42] curliegal1984: i find that so amusing now<br />[14:42] Brandon Crall: oh oh...being in traffic, you have to use my joke.

<br />And&nbsp; also, I saw my cousin Nikki's away message last night and I sat there pondering it for a few minutes. I think it's one of the best things I've heard lately. Here tis: <br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Courier;""><font size=""2"">If you want to know where your heart is, look to where your mind goes when it wanders.</font><br /><br /></span>So true, non?&nbsp; Being mostly not busy allows my mind to wander a lot all the time.

"event","So today was another primarily uneventful day at work. Good did come of it tho: I chatted w/ Gregor and looked at his pictures for like 2 hours! Shazaam!&nbsp; It was great! :) I havent talked to him for that long of a period lately, and I really got a chance to have a good good look at his pics. I also chatted a bit with B. Crall and J. Sumner, pretty much per usual. HAHA&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I did exchange a few lines with B. Bouwman and The Chad as well! I found out that Dieneke did really good in her marathon this weekend, that Traverse was awesome (of course!) and Chad actually had work to do and seemed in slightly better spirits. Capital!

Several bad things happened tho. Well, not terrible, but not great. The package that I shipped on Friday (at 2 in the afternoon) was not received this morning at whatever time Wendy came to me. I have no idea why it didnt get there seeing as I sent it PRIORITY OVERNIGHT. HELLO?! DUR! It should have freaking been there on Saturday! Gosh sometimes Fed Ex pisses me off! We tracked it and the damn thing was still scheduled to have been checked out at 7:01am this morning and was basically sitting on the truck waiting for delivery at 7:44am. I'm pretty sure it was like 11:30 when she came rushing to me, so that meant that it was 11:30 and the damn package was still on the fucking truck! ARGH! People are morons. Anyways, then apparently there is a person by the name of Heather Francis who no longer exists at Doner. Instead there is a Heather Yuhas. And Heather Yuhas is supposed to have an extension and a cube assignment (but no email for some reason) and yet, when I go to find her cube, it is inhabited by a Mr. John Somethingorother. WTF. So poor Heather hasn't received her copy of the Expedia Deck that I so lovingly b&amp;w and color copied for her. Well damn.&nbsp;

The last eventful thing of the day occured when I went to retrieve some interoffice envelopes and I ran into Keran and Carmen. I volunteered myself to help Carmen move a bunch of old Creative boards from the 3rd floor to the ""Media Arts room"" which apparently is in the basement. Little did I know that that also included stuffing the stupid cardboard/ styrofoam boards in with all the other millions of boards and piles of papers and boxes and leather carrying cases. Or that Carmen would drop a bunch of them on my toes. hahah She felt so bad, it was amusing. Not that having them on my foot felt great, but then I did the same exact thing again like 5 minutes later. I also backed into the door and narrowly missed smashing my fingers in the cart. haha yeah I told Carmen I think my lunar moon was not following the path of my rising tide. She looked at me like ""wtf"" and I said, ""well you know... how people blame their clumsiness on the full moon or something""&nbsp; then she laughed for like 10 minutes and kept apologizing profusely while we lugged these things up and down the stairs :-P&nbsp;

So pretty much another boring day at the office. Oh Donald Trump, eat your heart out.&nbsp;


As for yesterday and the weekend: glorious! The heat is so freaking wonderful, it made me want to swim all day long! Too bad I never got to :(&nbsp;&nbsp; But after I took that 4 hour nap on friday when I came home to get rid of the migraine, I felt pretty good all weekend. Dad and I made the trekk to Dayton to visit the Grandparents, and Aunts and Uncles and Cousins, and everyone had a really really nice time. This is very surprising b/c usually I can't wait to come home as soon as we get there. But this time Uncle Tony and Aunt Judy were in from AZ and I think they really had some good time to catch up with their siblings. No one fought, no one made an ass out of themselves, there were no awkward silences. Everyone goofed around and stuff. Even Grandma! whoa that's crazy talk.&nbsp; Diana and Sophia and I got a chance to see eachother, which I love, and want to do again this summer as a girls weekend. Not sure how that's going to work out, but we'll see.&nbsp;

Then yesterday was Aunt Rory's bday celebration with the rest of the Dygert family. This includes Aunt Jackie and Uncle BJ, and their wonderfully funny, crazy kids, Jack (4), Nicole (6) and Danielle (13). Those 2 little ones absolutely crack me up. They pick at each other, and fight, and laugh, and whine with eachother so much it's hysterical. I can't even really begin to say. I hope Aunt Rory sends me her pictures b/c she has some CLASSIC ones of Jack. He is just WAY TOO CUTE for his own good. And I DONT think it's FAIR that my YOUNGER cousin Danielle is 2 INCHES TALLER THAN ME. *POUT* Swear to God, her shoulders are way above mine. That girl is an absolute bean pole with legs up to her ears! All I can say is her parents are gonna have a hellavatime keeping those Southern boys away from her! She is one beautiful girl! (And I'm totally not just saying that b/c I'm her older cousin...)&nbsp; But they're moving to Georgia pretty soon! :( &nbsp;It makes me so sad! I love those guys! But they are almost done building their house and I know they will absolutely love it, so I can't stay sad for that long.&nbsp;

Alright, well I'm going to go look at more pictures from overseas and try to get my laptop working enough to take the pics off of my camera from yesterday and the weekend. There's a really funny one of Diana and I goofing around with sparklers and her mom too. We look like we're high with all the smoke from the sparklers. haha what an amusing weekend! I dont want to go to the doctor's tomorrow after work! UGH! this sucks. lol and I still need to make my dentist appointment for my cavity :-\&nbsp; Maybe I can balance it out by making a hair appointment? Or maybe I can convince Mom that I really need to go work-clothes-shopping this weekend since I'm not going to Kentucky?! Hm... I'll have to try that."

It's our nature to play the ""female"" game. see answer to above question tho... I try not to play games b/c I hate when they're played on me. <br /><font color=""#993366"">14) Do you believe love at first sight exists?</font><br />I believe in lust and like at first sight. I believe that first impressions are always important, but as far as ""love"" at first sight, I dont think so. I think real ""love"" grows over time and given other circumstances. I'll just stop now before I go into my diatribe from Com 370 last semester. <br /><font color=""#993366"">15) Are you romantic?</font><br />HAHAHA who are you asking?! OF COURSE I AM<br /><font color=""#993366"">16) Do you believe that you can change someone?</font><br />yeah, well kinda. I think that it's in my nature to try and help people, and try to change their negative behaviors (I suppose) into more positive ones. Like there was this guy who was always such an asshole and very negative and I became friends with him and over time I didnt realize that just by being friends with him (and being me) I helped to change his attitude, etc. I laugh when he says it, but he does give me some credit. I say that's pretty cool. As long as he's not such an asshole anymore ;)<br /><font color=""#993366"">17) If you could get married anywhere, where would it be?</font><br />you know, I'm pretty damn open for suggestions at this point. <br /><font color=""#993366"">19) Do you easily give in when you are fighting?</font><br />nope, not really. it's usually pretty grudgingly if at all<br /><font color=""#993366"">20) Do you have feelings for someone right now?<br /></font>when don't I have feelings for someone? haha <br /><font color=""#993366"">21) Have you ever wished you could've had someone but you messed it up?<br /></font>hm not really. I think everything happens for a reason in the long run<br /><font color=""#993366"">22.) Have you ever broken a heart?</font><br />I dont really know, no one's ever told me ""Renee, you broke my heart"" <br /><font color=""#993366"">23.) What will happen if you found someone else in bed with your significant other?</font><br />go ballistic. Lebanese woman style. pretty much. Let your imaginations run wild, I'm sure it's not far from the truth ;)<br /><font color=""#993366"">24.) Would you ever fight somebody over your significant other?</font><br />sure. he's mine now, bitch. HAHA (was that the right answer?)<br /><font color=""#993366"">25.)What would you say about your ex???</font><br />*eyebrow* uhm...... ""Everything happens for a reason."" Or, ""I'm taking the 5th."" How's that? lol<br /></div>
<br />Okay Tim seems to have a lot to do right now from his account reps... but he never really stays late! Where is the fairness in that?! *stomp*&nbsp; And can someone please tell Mother Nature to stop fucking around with my head? I'd appreciate it if I didnt have a cold during summer vacation! Thanks!"

"event","hehe This was an amusing message to find when I got back to my desk this evening. It's from good ol' Jimmar, whom I havent talked to or seen in FOREVER! I miss him!&nbsp; I miss ""our handshake"" haha :) good times in E/F...valley 3

Jimmar: Feel better quick cuz the world needs your smile
&nbsp; Times get ""intense"" that's what makes life worthwhile
&nbsp; you got this, trust me, just let me tell you how
&nbsp; show that sore throats who's boss with all of your style
&nbsp; holla!&nbsp;

And yes, I did stay later tonight again *sigh* I only stayed an hour, but I guess it's just that by the time 5:30 rolls around I just want to get out of there! I should really be expecting to stay late all the time given that it's a ""real person's job"" (technically). Oh well.&nbsp;

And yeah, my throat really still hurts. Dinner helped a bit, and I suspect ice cream would too since it's cold, but other than that, I'm gulping down water. The Pistons are kind of pissing me off, and House was just really weird tonight! A good final show, no doubt, but it was totally weird. Oh well... I'll have to see who won American Idol tomorrow morning (yes I missed it tonight and no I dont really care)&nbsp;

:-P&nbsp;

I should go figure out what I'm wearing to work and make my lunch. Ho hum. then to bed for me. I havent been sleeping all that great again lately :-\&nbsp; but OH! I have to email my resume to this guy at Stryker... he called me at work yesterday and wondered if I was still interested in a position. I was like ""uh...I'm at work... how about for fall?"" haha"

"event","okay so yesterday at like 5, Sue asked if I could help find the locations of all the Goody retailers and type them out in a list. No problem. Barb's like ""oh you dont have to do this for today we just need them"" Oh, okay. So since it was 5, I was like ""cool. I'll save it and do it tomorrow and I'll actually have something to do.""

So I got here and was taking a quick parusal of my emails, answering the ones that were relevant, and then I was planning on starting it. Yep, so I did at like 10:00.... who knew the dam company was in like 20 states, and had like.... 13 pages of EXCEL to fill up!!!!! Seriously it was so entirely frustrating... the damn website kept timing out and freezing up my computer, and every time I'd try to copy over the addresses of the store (one at a time, b/c it also included irrelevant information), it would mess up what I already had...

By the time 2:30 rolled around and I worked through lunch, I was pissed. That and I felt bad b/c they needed the information. Then about 3:30 Rachel had already asked me to help her with a ton of copies for a meeting, and now that stuff was getting really important. There was so much that we each took half and scrambled around making copies. Then, the best thing ever happened- in both copy rooms, 2 of the copiers ran out of toner! No joke. 

After we finally got the copies made and stuff, I had sent out the email, I was like ""okay! enough!"" and my throat has been getting progressively worse as the day wears on. POO! It feels that wonderful ""on fire"" feeling like before I get strep. eesh. 

In any case, I think at this point, I've done all I can do. I've run a few ""hot"" readers back and forth in the last 20 minutes, but I think that's done for the day. I also think Dad and I are on our own for dinner tonight b/c Mom has a meeting... hm I think we're going out and I'm getting soup. Time to check my email again real quick before the end of the day to make sure there are no more pressing matters!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Ta



****Editor's note:&nbsp;&nbsp; I just checked&nbsp; my mail... ooooo! *grin* isn't it just simply terribly horribly wonderfully teriffic when you get an email you dont expect to get!?! and sometimes just the simplest phrases mean absolutely the most. *SIGH* I just love that.&nbsp; It makes me swoon&nbsp;&nbsp; :) &nbsp;&nbsp; :) &nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)"

"event","check the time. yup, 6:35 and I'm still at work. Well, good news is that I get overtime. I was leaving at 5:30 when someone asked me if I had met this lady... I say ""no..."" and she goes, ""oh! you're our intern? great! i have this i need some help with""

....

great. Oh, and apparently she only works 3 days a week. Excellent. So basically I'll probably have questions for her and she wont be here ever. Yippee. So what am I doing now? Currently waiting for some man named Brian to call me. Brian is in turn waiting for someone else to call him and give him the ""okay"" on some letter. If (and it's not looking like it's happening tonight) he doesn't get the Okay for the letter, I can't ship out the package tonight. If he DOES get the Okay for the letter, then I have to ship it. And FedEx picks up at 7:30... so I need him to call me soon. What's shipping out is a dub-cd full of tv spots (commercials, promos, etc). So this is important. This isnt even my account! 

And yet, I dont want to screw this up. That would be extremely bad. Good thing how no one has good communication skills. I've already learned that about this business. Seriously, I've been in Traffic (this is my 2nd week) and I already can tell that. 

Tomorrow apparently I'm covering for 2 people- Alaina and Aimee. Great again! I have no idea about their accounts or anything! I hope no one needs anything! *gulp*

And tomorrow night I'm supposed to drive back to Kzoo for the weekend to go to Ty's shower, our dress fittings, etc. *SIGH* whatev. 

I think I'm going to walk back by Brian's office to see if his lights are still on."

"event","True Friendship

Are you tired of those sissy-ass ""friendship"" poems that always sound good, but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a series of promises that actually speak of true friendship:

1. When you are sad -- I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad.

2. When you are blue -- I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.

3. When you smile -- I will know you finally got laid.

4. When you are scared -- I will rag on you about it every chance I get.

5. When you are worried -- I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be until you quit whining.

6. When you are confused -- I will use little words.

7. When you are sick -- Stay the hell away from me until you are well again. I don't want whatever you have.

8. When you fall -- I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

9. This is my oath..... I pledge it to the end.
""Why?"" you may ask; "" because you are my friend"". 


ps- yay i finally got the phone call i was waiting for! thank goodness! *phew!*"

"event","Alright, there was a delay in the rest of the post, not that it's a big deal, but I just thought i'd finish it now that I'm back from next door.&nbsp; I tguess that's what we call it here- the building next door houses 2 floors of Doner people- Media/Print productions and stuff like that. I dont know, actually, that's just what I think- the 3rd and 4th floors are the places we have to keep routing stuff back and forth from. Anyways, Cori just asked me to take some prints next door to (the one person who I actually remember where she sits) a media gal- Torrey. She's very nice, and there were a few of the readers there that I'm not sure if they could come back here or not, but I didnt want to chance anything and bring stuff back I was not supposed to. On a similar note, there are readers here that could go over there, i think, but I dont know where they are supposed to go. SO. that leaves me in a pickle! Basically unless someone tells me they need something done, I have no idea what to do. 

I suppose I'll just sit here and continue to dink around and listen to WCSX streamed offline. God I forgot how much I miss this station! BUT I am delighted to learn that I can now listen to it in Kzoo anytime I want by doing the same thing I am now :) YAY! 

Also, on my way back from next door, Alaina took me downstairs to meet the media imaging guys, and also to show me the media library. I guess tomorrow she's not going to be here, so she asked if I could pick them up for her. NO PROB BOB! (at least I hope not!) So now I know 2 new places to check for things for people if they need stuff. *shrug* whether or not I'll remember is another thing...

She also showed me around the accounting and HR sides of the building, and also the ""talent"" area where they do all the hiring of the talent for commericals and stuff. Kinda neat.&nbsp; Additionally, I learned where the Expense guy is- so that's where I go to pick up my expense checks if I need to. And I just went back across (the parking lot) again to deliver MORE readers. I think if I keep doing it to the same people, I should remember in a few days where they sit and I wont feel like a weirdo asking people. 

Anyways, maybe I should just go now so I dont keep rambling and stopping my posts to deliver things. I think that's a good idea. Today is much much slower than yesterday, unfortunately. I hope this is not a 3 day a week thing... MWF are slow, TR are fast. That might be a bummer. We'll see..."

"event","again with the non- working! hah. this job just gets weirder and weirder! 

my first day here at Doner i did absolutely JACK SHIT. nothing. i did NOTHING. i sat here on my ass all day, in my empty cube, just a computer and phone and some empty folder racks. that's about it. i checked my email about 50 times an  hour (all of them- both work ones, and all my normal ones) and i parooooozed the interweb for many hours on end. i didnt think 5:30 would come at all. and i actually was very very disappointed b/c i had wanted to work on stuff. i thought perhaps they would be so incredibly busy that i wouldnt have time to sit down. oh man i was obviously wrong. 

actually, funny enough, the Traffic peeps are telling me that they've never had a Traffic intern before. And right now, with the changing of accounts and stuff, there's not much work for even them to do (let alone me). I am helping out one gal in particular, but she's not in traffic- she's  what you call a ""new business"" coordinator. so yeah. Yesterday she had me doing copying from various places, (staple included!), dropping off and picking up of media imaging stuff, and things like that. it wasnt hard but it did eat up time and that was a good thing. I also had to go around the agency doing these things, so it made me try to figure out where i was and how to get where i needed to go. i also ran to Best Buy with Janelle to buy Hulk for some creative guy... apparently they needed to know when in the movie the scene shots changed to look like ""comic book squares"" or layout or something. So then i watched that Hulk in 2x fast mode and had to write down what ""chapter"" it was in since playing it on the computer doesnt allow me to tell the specific times. 

anyway, more later. i gotta run next door"

that's a quote from two of the best media planning group members ever. a bit of an inside joke with us, but it was a comment cheray made that we said w were gonna use as a tag line. then brandon (w) said ""i'd rather do it right than do it fast"" ... haha lots of double entendres and sexual undertones going on. it was great- cheray and i made fun of him all the time.

anyways, my entire other entry got canceled and im pissed so i am considering not typing out another one. the other one was AWESOME. you should be disappointed you didnt see it. and now the red cardinal is gone, so even that is lost.... *SIGH*

i just got back my interview and the awards luncheon. it was fun being with dr. lancendorfer and nicole the entire afternoon. it was a bit like going to a Rotary Club luncheon. Very ""networky"". Very ""hi let me shake your hand and pretend to listen to what you're saying while i wait to tell you my story"". Very interesting. There were a lot of crazy Ad people. We got some business cards, which was good. If just for Ad club, then hopefully we can arrange some cool speakers. If for me, well hey! It never hurts to network! Esp if I'm considering jobs with places outside of MI for the future- which I am. I mean let's face it, the economy and the Ad industry in MI is sucking it up big time right now. If I can get some experience now, finish school, maybe get a few more years here somewhere, I'd love to go outside MI and work for a different firm somewhere. Perhaps CA, TX, AZ, GA, NY, whatever. I have some family connexions in KY, OH, TX, GA, used to be in CA, HI (Hawaii?), Rochester NY, and Boston, so who knows... Lately, all this suggestion of ""think about your future"" and ""would you consider in your future"" has really just numbed my brain out right now. Not that I haven't thought about it in the past, or been thinking about it constantly, but now that I really am being asked flat out- would you think about this for the future- it just really.... it blows my mind.  I thought I knew what I wanted and I still think I have a damn good idea, but I'm being asked to consider something else that I never really thought seriously about, and so it being an option kinda makes everything topsy turvy. 

I dont think it's hit me yet, fully. I need a few days to let everything sink in. 

school is done with now too. WHAT. I just can't comprehend that yet. after the last month and a half of me going absolutely ape-shit with projects and deadlines and stress and running around, i feel like i need to go do something. haha bah! if i get an internship- no summer classes. but if i dont- summer classes and work and homework. and the second choice is what i've been used to. it's the routine that i've known. scary. i feel like i've been a student forever and that i will continue to be one forever. i dont want that yet at the same time, it's all i've known so being out in the real world is scaring me. haha im a loser, i know. and now this means i will have time to hang out with people! friends, family, and of course now that i have time to hang out with them, people that arent here. that always happens. that's ironic. that's always how it works it seems for me. wow this means i'll have more time with my thoughts to myself and i wont have to clutter it up with school work. the future! ah! it looms ahead! i'm being asked to think about things that involve my life, and not just when my next exam is, or when that project is due... crap! 

this isnt supposed to be a downer post or anything, but is it turning out to be that way? sorry, i guess i just have a lot of serious things on my mind right now. *shrug* that's why the last post was better too b/c the cardinal was in it, and he was beautiful. I'll say it again now, but it wont have quite the same effect: ""Just now the most gorgeous bright red colored cardinal landed in our yard and is hopping all around. I just love color.""

Also, Katie Parfitt, I am still planning on coming to MSU to see Janelle's dance recital on Sunday. Kosh?

Alright, time to change out of my suit, thank the lord. I went to Doner this morning for the interview and the receptionist remembered me from my last interview. Haha I walked in and she asked me if she knew me. Then she said she remembered my face and my voice. I laughed and asked if that was a bad thing, and she said ""No! You have sort of a raspy voice- like a singer! Are you a singer? You could have a singing career!""  haha that made my morning. :0) She's a super nice lady. A sort of hip, fun, genuinely nice friendly lady. Black, cute glasses, short choppy hair, great laugh and voice herself. I really get a kick out of her. I do like her. I was thinking as I was sitting there conversing with her (waiting for my interview), is it good that I like her so much? Is it good that I'm getting along with her? I mean, being on friendly terms/ getting in good with the receptionist at an Ad firm certainly can't hurt!!! 

:0P I'm weird. It's been a long day. I mean, come on...fuck."

curliegal1984:  3 finals down, 1 to go, and a presentation on Thursday... then work Thursday afternoon, then driving home that night (as in home/home). 

then Friday morning I have my 2nd interview with Doner (eeeee!!!!!!) at 9:30am, and I'm getting awarded my Adcraft scholarship at 11:30am. 

then Friday night I'm driving back here to Kzoo b/c I work at graduation from 8am to 8pm on Saturday. 

.....so yeah, doing good.....
________________________________________________


so it looks like i might be moving home afterall this summer. part of me wants to b/c hey, it's a freaking internship. the other part is like ""noooooo! you were gonna finally be here the entire year! nooooooo!"" and that makes me sad. *sigh* and given the past week's events, it appears i have a lot to think about. wow. i dont know how that makes me feel. haha

good and bad. excited and scared. too bad i dont want to study for my last final tomorrow. instead i'd just like to lay on the couch and watch a movie. course i'd also like to go to the gym, but i would require energy to do that, and right now i have none. perhaps tomorrow after my 8am final, and before my Media group meets to put together our presentation for Thursday.

"event","i dont know why i'm up, but it appears i am. by all accounts i shouldnt be... we had our last Ad Club Social Event last night- Senior Sendoff. everyone who's the coolest in Ad Club met at 5pm for dinner at Gallagher's and we had 4 choices, mine was a very delicious Turkey Club. For free. Our alcohol at Gallaghers was not free, but that's fine. I only had 1 beer there. Then Dr. Lancendorfer met us there around 6, and said that Dr. Roz and Mr. Weitzel were finishing their round of golf (some WMU thing) and would meet us after. So we all trooped over to Firehouse...at 7pm! Seriously we started drinking by 7:30 and I was realllllly well lit by 12:30. So was Dr. Lancendorfer. So was pretty much everyone :-P 

come to think of it. I had 1 Heini at Gallagher's, then at least 1 oberon at Firehouse, and at least 2 Killians. I'm thinking more like 3. Also interspersed in there was the 2 shots of Jager that Dr. Roz and Mr. Weitzel bought us. HAHAHA. Dr. Roz got there and we were like ""oh! hey! drink!"" and so she bought everyone a round. I swear they were double shots of straight Jager. *shudder* then a little while later, Mr. Weitzel showed up and was like ""oh i missed it?! oh well i'll buy you all another!"" so we had another! hahaha then he stuck around for another beer too. 

GOOD TIMES! seriously i hope the pictures turn out well because we have some classics. like of the pool game, of Dr. L with her drink, Dr. Roz with all the shot glasses. everyone gathered around Mr. W. haha Im not sure how I managed to drive home, but I did. I think it might have helped that I was crunching on ice chips for a long time... and when i got home i drank some more water. i vaguely remembering forcing myself to put my jammies on, but that was a struggle. 

:-P oh well. im up, it's early, im thinking of going to the 9:30 mass at St. A's. We're not meeting in our group tonight until like 8, so that'll work i suppose to have me study during the day for my finals tomorrow and tuesday. eesh. there are other things i'd rather be doing, and one of those actually does include finishing our dreaded medai plan! surprising! 

so beings the week of hell. well not any more than the last 3 weeks, so i think im good. haha my posts have been few and far between at best. sorry! i just havent had time nor anything good to say so i decided to just not post. haha who wants to read all the bad drama that happens in my life? sometimes i dont even want to live it! ^_^ alright. time to jet.

:-P I miss him like crazy! wow! I hope his surgery goes well... I'll be thinking of him on May 31... I really really want to find a cool tiara and send it to him... hm, I need his address too. Or I wonder if I could look up his brother Darrell and get it without Crall knowing.... *ponders*"

"event","just thought i'd share that little subject line. i dont know why but it makes me think of the Fairruz song I showed Brandon last night. At Ravenwood the music sounded almost familial at one point, so i looked her up and lo and behold! NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN played him a clip. i like listening to it sometimes- the cadence of her voice and the tones and pitches... just really cool to hear her sing. :-P and i'm not just saying that b/c she's like this legendary arabic singer. hah. 

oh, and YES brandon should be on a shit list. that little f*er. haha he is on my ""excommunication"" list for a few days. he knows what he did. :-P (and thanks for all the messages this morning, guys. LIKE I COULD EVER REALLY BE THAT PISSED AT SOMEONE! hahahahaha COME ON!!!!) 

anyways, Maggie the dog is waiting. James is trying to send me a video to watch, but I really want to go let the poor dog out! I'm tempted to leave her out in the backyard while I go to target real quick- but then again, I'm nervous. I'll probably just leave her outside while I eat dinner or something.... I dont know. this is such a pain in the ass. too bad their house is so far away. UGH. 

ummmmm yeah and we just got assigned ANOTHER FUCKING CASE STUDY. hello? could we POSSIBLY give me SOMETHING else to do!? b/c I dont have enough on my plate as it is.... I'm counting here..... I've got 3 huge projects (2 of them group), 1 case study, 2 papers, and 4 more tests coming up (that are during finals week- 2 are comprehensive finals). I feel like Vinny from My Cousin Vinny, when he's talking to Lisa about her ""biological clock"" *stomp stomp* hahaha I love that movie. For anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about, watch the movie. The scene is near the end. Then we'll talk. 

oy vey. alright time to go bust a move. it's gonna be another looooooooooong ass night. (i went to bed at 3 this morning. thanks to christine and the research in GR, i wasted about 6 hours of good solid work time during the day. i can't afford that again tonight.)"

last night was really fun! haha it was the first time tyky actually had people over at their house and i think we all had a random, just easy going, hangout kind of fun :) Grimm brought me the 2 things he owed me: my fleece and beer haha so the bet is considered paid off. good man. let's see, Lizzie came over and brought us Shwarma, then Brandon came over to eat it, Trent stopped by for a bit, then Fritz and Barbie, then Dirk, and then Grimm. OH! and then Christine (UTD christine) and our other Christine got home from the gym. We just watched tv/ Just Friends, drank and had loud, obnoxious conversations. And the Tirimisu was very very good! YAY for an actual oven that works!

Today Dan's cello recital was sooooo good! Aw! I miss seeing Dan! I think he looks tons better than the last few times I saw him... I just hope he's finally happy. I know things were rough for a while. I think his bf brought him flowers :) how sweet! *le swoon* 

(I did actually talk with Emily. Interesting. She seemed geniuinely interested in how the school year was going for me and seemed geniuniely concerned when I said that we had to move out, etc. I'd like to think she really was being friendly... I know I tried to be with her before and I always got the cold shoulder, etc. So whatev)

Okay, now that it's raining, it makes it a perfect day to stay inside and get shit done. That dude never emailed me the rest of the notes for our test tomorrow. GREAT. *sigh* fuck. oh well. 

Time for my prioritizing skills to really kick into overdrive. Coffee time! PS. side note, i was unconscious this morning...ahaha im surprised i dont have a headache :-P"

"event","well it's 1:34 and i just watched tv with the parents... it's weird cause they never really used to watch tv with me when i was here for the summer or whatever (since high school) and now they are like ""hey, whaddya doing? Monk is on! House is on!"" blah blah. haha they wanted me to come and watch tv with them. it was cute. and KC, our cat who never likes to sit with anyone on the couch actually sits with my dad now so he scratches here head. talk about weird. they're both turning into softies! 

anyways. THE INTERVIEW. duh duh duh! i dont know how it went. i dont know how it turned out. i wont know how it went or turned out for a while until Mr. John Kingsley calls me or emails me or something. Probably not for another few weeks. apparently Doner is in the process of ""rethinking how they want to do interns"" which means that he is going to have all his managers write up how they'd like to see the intern stuff handled and then they're going to decide what to do. but i know this much: A. i didnt make an ass out of myself. B. he asked me questions which i never in my wildest dreams thought he'd ask. C. the inside of Doner is like a blend of an art museum, a hotel and an Ad firm. D. i at least got John to smile, nod and chuckle a few times (so i think i at least made an impact).  Anyways, that guy is a good HR guy. imcredibly hard to read, very intimidating, but very nice. I hope hope hope hope hope that I do get an internship there- looked like a really awesome place to work with a lot of great people. 

then of course i had dinner tonight with mom, dad, aunt rory and uncle bert. went to one of my fav restaurants: Trattoria which is an italian place. OOOO YUM. and i had the waiter recommend a good red to me- he brought me his fav Chianti which i dont remember the name now, but he was right! it was super tastey! and i had my fav ravioli! wee! 

as for the whole ""Christine"" and ""house"" thing... whatever. i've washed my hands. i feel damn good to be free. it was a very liberating epiphany and it could not have come at a better time. school shit is taking over my life for the next 3-4 weeks. then i'll also be free again! yay! 

alright. grimm's going to bed and since im talking to him, and im tired, i think i will too. Good night!"

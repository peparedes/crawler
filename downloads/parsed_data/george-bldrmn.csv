"event","Penny is still sleeping when I crawl from the bed and make my way to the kitchen. Last night's and this morning's Daily Prophet are sitting on the table but I ignore them as I make my way to the coffee pot. With all the time I've spent here, I've become quite talented at running the Muggle contraption. Once it's running, I sit at the table and pick up the morning edition.

I scan over it quickly, not seeing anything interesting when my eyes briefly catch the front page of last nights paper. Tossing aside the other, I read over the front page article from last night, my blood running cold.

<i>This cannot be happening. Dear Merlin what if he goes after her again.</i>

I lay the paper down and cover my face with my hands. <i>And just when she was finally able to spend a night alone.</i>

The coffee maker switches off but I ignore it as I head back to the bedroom. She'll sleep for another twenty minutes or so before getting up. I slip back in beside her, holding her close. I'll tell her when she wakes up. It will be better if she hears it from me instead of the paper. And if I tell myself that enough times, maybe I'll believe it."

"event","I open the door to the Infirmary and grin when I find it empty. I pull the note out of my pocket and tack it to the door, informing all residents that Lavender is otherwise occuppied and can only be interrupted in case of a dire emergency. I lock the door and put a Silencing charm on the room before making my way to the door into Lavender's quarters.

I hear the shower running and grin as I make my way towards the sound, dropping articles of clothing as I go. I quietly open the bathroom door, slipping quietly in behind Lavender in the shower. 

Her gasp of surprise soon turns to moans of pleasure as I slip one finger into her wetness and press my lips to her throat.

""Thought you could use some company. There's a do not disturb sign on the outer door. I think we'll be left alone for awhile.""

Her only response is the nod of her head and and soon I hear her cry of release as her walls clench around my fingers. ""Hope you didn't have any plans for this afternoon. I think they just got changed."""

"event","Pain courses through my body and I move, trying to get comfortable. I soon realize I'm on a hard, uneven surface and comfortable is not an option. I crack one eye open and immediately shut it as I'm greeted by the harsh morning sun. I groan and roll over. I soon realize I was on a bench as I meet air and fall to the ground.

I open my eyes as I realize my entire body is feeling the cool of the ground. I look down towards my feet, noticing for the first time that I'm wearing nothing but a sock. <i>What the hell did I drink last night?</i>

I sit up and look around for my pants and then realize where I am. The teacher and visitor stands at the Quidditch pitch. I furrow my brow in confusion and look around for my pants. My gaze falls on my one sock and I see a piece of paper sticking out the top of it. I pull it out and read the note.

<i>Your name is George Weasley. Come to the Infirmary if you need help remembering anything else.</i>

<lj-cut text=""Scavenger Hunt"">I grin as things from the night before come rushing back. I had forgotten just how good things were between Lavender and I. She wasn't kidding when she said she was going to make me forget everything. When we walked into what used to be Hagrid's hut, I wasn't expecting half of what I got.

Very few people can catch me by surprise. Lavender managed to do just that as soon as the door closed behind us. I think that was the quickest anyone had ever removed my clothing. And then she proceeded to remind me just what her mouth was capable of doing. Of course after that we rememorized each others bodies. Not that I ever really forgot, but it's good to be reminded.

I look down and curse as I realize that even thinking about what all we did last night is arousing me again. I look at the note in my hand. Yes, will have to find Lavender. Although maybe I'll wait a day. Wouldn't want to wear myself out. Maybe I could finish that stamina formula I'd been working on.

I look around for my pants but don't see them anywhere. I scratch my head and look out over the pitch. My eyebrows shoot up as I see a lump of material that looks like my pants over in the Gryffindor stands. <i>Dear Merlin, where all did we go last night?</i> Snippets of the romp in the Gryff stands flash into my mind. Who knew she could bend that way?

I look all around the grounds to make sure nobody's out and about and run quickly to the Gryffindor stands. I grin in triumph as I pull my pants off the top seat. My boxers however are nowhere to be found. I shrug and pull on my pants. I feel something in my pocket and reach in, pulling out a red, lace thong. I groan as I feel my pants tighten. <i>Damn. Definitely going to need a cold shower.</i>

I make my way down from the stands and head towards the barn. Hopefully the rest of my clothing would be there. I make my way around the lake on the way to the barn and find my shirt. My pants get even tighter as more things about last night resurface. I put my arms through the sleeve of my shirt and look out across the water.

Swimming is so much more fun when you're naked. Although I guess we technically weren't swimming. But that's just a technicality. I make a mental note to bring her out here again some night. So many more things to try and do to her in the water. Considering how murky the lake is, I could probably accomplish it during the day as well.

I finally make my way back to the barn and locate my other sock and my shoes. My boxers are still missing. But considering I have Lavender's knickers, it's quite possible that she has my boxers. It's a shame I had a list of things waiting to be done up in the lab. Looks like a cold shower and a good wank were going to be first on the list though.

I whistle as I head back through the halls of the school. I'd let her stew for a bit. Let her wonder if I'm going to come back. First thing tomorrow morning, I'd be there. Ready for round two. Or would it be round five?"

I crumple up the note and throw it in the trashbin. I sit on my bed for a moment, my head between my hands. I told her last night that if she said no more, I'd be okay with it. What a liar I've turned into.

I pick the note up out of the trashbin so that nobody will find it. I throw it in the fireplace on my way up to the lab. The only thought at the foremost of my mind is how to get her to change her mind. I don't know what it is about her that makes me want to do this. There's just something about her that screams out to me and I only want to give her the attention that she doesn't seem to think she deserves.

I shut the door of the lab behind me and pull out the parchment that has the potion formula on it. Taking a deep breath, I push all thoughts of Penny from my mind and get to work."

"event","The shrieks from the other side of the room pulled me away from the notes I was reading over for the millionth time. So much for thinking I could get work done while doing Head of House duties. I walk over to where the shrieks come to try and separate whatever mess I find.

<lj-cut text ""The evils of children"">""Kyle! What in Godric's name do you think you're doing?"" I ask as I pry the scissors out of his hands.

""She started it! She told me I wasn't any good at Charms and that Bill was gonna fail me before next week!""

I look down at the girl sitting on the floor. His sister. Dear Merlin, it was Ron and Ginny all over again.

""Kiera, it's the first day of class. Could you refrain from tormenting your brother until you're certain he's going to fail Charms?""

""Just because he's a Ravenclaw he thinks he knows everything,"" Kiera said as she tried to march past me. I grab her arm and put her back in front of me.

""You're both in Ravenclaw there genius. Now if you two don't straighten up, I'm sure I have a few things I could go dig up out of my lab to make you behave. The last person to swallow something I made ended up in the infirmary. Now stop the arguing. I don't want to see the two of you near each other for the rest of the evening. If I hear one more argument, I'm taking points.""

I stand there to make sure they go their separate ways and go back to my notes. I know that invisibility pill should've worked, I just have to figure out why it didn't. Just as I'm settling back in, a crash from behind me sends me flying from my seat.

""WHO DID IT?"" I yell, sounding too much like my father. Pieces of a broken statue of Salazar Slytherin lay around the bookshelf. I don't care much since it is Slytherin, but I guess I must do my duty as Head of House.

Wide eyes stare back at me as the only response. A couple of the girls are biting their lips and it looks like they're about to cry. One boy standing close to the bookshelf istrying to not to laugh while also attempting to look innocent. I narrow my eyes and look hard at him.

""Andrew Lawrence, right? You wouldn't happen to know how the statue that used to sit on top of that shelf is now lying in pieces on the floor would you?""

""My guess is that it fell,"" Andrew said. ""That's how most things that start up high end up in pieces on the floor.""

""Five points from Gryffindor. Now try to answer without the sarcasm.""

""You took points from Gryffindor? I didn't even do it on purpose!""

""It doesn't matter if you did it on purpose. The fact is, you did it and now you get to clean it up."" I turn and look at the other students. ""The common room is not a gym! Nobody is forcing you to be inside the common room at this time of night. If you feel the need to expend energy, you do have a curfew before you have to be in here. So let's try not to destroy the common room on the first night of classes.""

A few of the students trickle out of the room to enjoy their last bit of time before curfew hits. The quieter ones stay behind and a few begin working on whatever homework they were assigned today. As quiet finally drifts through the room, I settle in to try and figure out what went wrong with the pill I gave to Dean.</lj-cut>"

The door to the lab flies open and within moments, I have the list of ingredients in my hand. Of course, it's the only list so I can't give it to her if I hope to ever repeat what I accidentally did. I copy the list onto another sheet of parchment and head down to try and find Penelope.

I see her coming out of Lupin's office and I wave.

""Hello Penelope, good to see you again,"" I say as I give her a quick peck on the cheek. ""Sorry I didn't get back to you but this is the list of everything inside the cockroaches.""

She smiles and thanks me and we talk for a moment more about the cockroaches before she leaves to head back home. It is getting rather late and I decide that for once, I'm going to sleep in my bed rather than my lab and I head for the common room."

Why was I not good enough? Why couldn't I get through to her? Sure, we danced together a few times. Thought we were even having fun. But then she goes to <i>Snape</i>? Of all people, she goes to him and looked quite at ease around him. Almost like she'd been that close to him before. 

I flip over the table that has all the notes for all the projects I'm working on. Papers scatter to the floor and I feel somewhat satisfied as two of the table legs snap off.

My chest rises and falls rapidly as I breathe in deeply. How could I get through to her? I told her I wouldn't care anymore, that I was fine with how things were. I thought girls were supposed to be able to see through stupid lies that guys told?

I scream in frustration and grab another container and throw it against the furthest wall away. I don't notice that the door didn't latch behind me and Terry has poked his head in.

""You alright in here, George?""

""Go away!"" I scream as I throw a container and watch as it shatters against the doorframe right next to his head. ""Leave me alone! You shouldn't be here! Get out!""

I throw more containers as he turns and quickly closes the door behind him. The last container hits the door right where his head had been moments before. Great Godric, I could've killed him. I back up against the wall and slide down to the floor, surrounded by paper and shattered glass, and the tears of rage and jealousy begin to fall."

"event","I wake to a tangle of sheets and a whopper of a headache. My vision is fuzzy as I try to focus through the early morning sunlight. The white walls are glaringly bright. Wait... white walls? The walls in my room aren't white.

I realize that not only am I tangled in sheets, I'm tangled up with another pair of legs. I smile lazily as I remember that I didn't go back to the castle last night and instead made use of one of the upstairs rooms. I'm sure Kingsley didn't mind me taking advantage of his entertainment last night.

I look over as I hear a muffled noise from the pillow beside me. What was her name again? Come to think of it, I don't think I ever asked. I pull the pillow off her head and look at her. Blonde hair, legs that go on forever. Who needed a name?

She looks up at me and smiles. ""So, you didn't run away last night. Most guys leave before now. I guess we did extend a lot of energy though. But unless you're going to hang around and repeat last night right now, you should go. It was great and all, but I'm not one for sticking around.""

""And if I do want a repeat of last night before I leave?"" I ask as I trail my hand up her thigh. ""We wouldn't want anyone to say your entertainment last night wasn't appreciated.""

""I don't think you really mean that though,"" she says as she sits up and looks at me. ""I can tell when they want me, and you don't want me. It was the alcohol talking last night and you have the headache to prove it.""

""How do you know I don't want it?"" I ask, my eyes firmly planted on her bare chest.

""Who's Lavender? Because that's the name you called out last night, and I know it's not my name. That's how I know it wasn't me you wanted to be with last night. Not that I care though. I make a living out of situations like this.""

She stands and quickly pulls her barely there clothing back and leaves the room as I'm left sitting there, staring after her. Damn. Would that infernal woman never be off my mind?"

I am still eaten up about everything that happened when I got back from my trip. I don't regret going to see Lavender, but I do regret telling Cho about it. One of these days, I would learn how to keep my big mouth shut.

Speaking of keeping big mouths shut, I still hadn't completed the antidote for the concoction I gave to Susan before I left. Poor girl's been left speechless for far too long. I would have to fix that. I only needed to tweak a couple more things and then I could set her back to the gossipy little snit she was before.

And one that I couldn't share with anyone else. Ever. The buying of supplies would always be sacred.

The list of places I'd been over the past week was growing. Africa, Australia, Russia, even a trip to the States. I was trying to visit places where I wouldn't stand out and be recognized as a Weasley or an Order member. The further away from London and from Hogwarts, the better.

I looked around the room that I was currently renting. It was getting hard to see the bed from all the boxes that were stocked up. I guess I should've sent these on to Cho. As a matter of fact, I'd get that done right now.

I quickly penned a letter and attached it to one of the boxes, explaining to her just to store the boxes in the lab and we'd go through them when I got back. Then I went down to the local owlery and told them my room number and that I had fifty boxes that needed to be shipped immediately to Hogwarts. I was assured that they would be on their way within the hour.

I paid for the shipping and then went back to check out of my room. I still had some things to buy and had exhausted all of my resources. Perhaps I'd make a return trip to the States."

We went up to her room, stopping a few times along the way as I pressed her against the nearest wall to kiss her. By the time we actually made it to her room, her eyes were dark with want and my pants were feeling remarkably tight.

Gone was the slow pace of the night before as we quickly rid each other of the restraining clothes. We were a mess of limbs as we collapsed onto her bed, pausing only long enough to put a silencing charm on the room. Turns out it was a good thing we did that. For someone who'd never done this before yesterday, she was quite the exuberant participant.

I could hear her even breathing and knew that she was asleep. I looked down at her and felt a pang of guilt for everything that had happened. She was so innocent and I took that from her. If she found out... No, she couldn't find out. I told her the things I did so that I wouldn't hurt her. If she found out that I hadn't meant any of it, it would destroy her.

I lay there, fighting my emotions. It didn't matter that Cho was the one laying there, she wasn't the one inside. I hated that I was doing this to her, but I didn't have a choice. It wasn't Cho's fault that I couldn't love her. The truth was, my heart was already spoken for. It didn't matter that she didn't want me. It couldn't change how I felt.

And that was fun branding the infirmary in our own way. How I would love to see the reactions on peoples faces if they knew what had taken place in their pristine and sanitary infirmary.

A tapping on the window made me look over and I saw the owl trying to get in. I let it in and recognized Lavender's handwriting on the paper. Guess she was missing me already. I took the paper off and opened it up.

<i>George,

I know this is an extremely cowardly thing for me to do...I'm ashamed of myself, in fact, but there you are.

This has been eating at me for days, and I just can't keep on like this.

I need to stop seeing you. I'm only using you for...well, to be honest, I'm using you for sex. I do like you, George, you're a great guy, in fact. But I just don't feel....there's no spark there. I need to put an end to this before things go any further and people are hurt more than they are already likely to be.

I'll understand if you are angry and I'm sorry if I'm hurting you. The time we spent together was really nice.

Thanks for everything,

Lavender </i>

I sat down on the nearest bed and just stared at the parchment in my hand. She... she dumped me! She told me the other day she had missed me and then she turns around and dumps me! And not only that, but she never even really liked me in the first place! That trashy little slut!

I was growing angrier by the minute and knew I needed to get out. I needed to throw something against a wall before I found Lavender and threw her against a wall. <i>The Room of Requirement.</i> I could go there and have it FILLED with breakable objects to throw against a wall.

I threw the letter in the fire on my way out of the Gryffindor common room. But not before turning to look at Dean.

""Hey Dean!"" I yelled. ""Just so you know, I've been shagging your best mates girl. She didn't want you to know, but now you know. Tell the little slut to go hang herself.""

I saw his eyes go wide before I slammed the door to the common room shut behind me. I didn't wait around to see more than that. I had places to be and things to destroy."

After guard duty that was entirely too boring and checking on the animals that were just as dull, I was quite irritated with everything in life. Once I found Malfoy, I was going to wring his no good pureblood neck and kick his arse into the next century for leaving me with these animals.

As I was getting dressed, I let my thoughts drift to yesterday. It was good to get everything with Tonks cleared up yesterday. Things might still be awkward for a little while, but at least we don't hate each other.

I didn't see Lavender at all yesterday. Not even in the Great Hall during lunch and dinner. Poor girl probably had herself locked away in the infirmary trying to get all that paperwork for the Ministry done. I doubt she was even remembering to eat.

Once I was dressed I decided I would go snag some food from the kitchens and take it up to her. She could use a break. And I wanted to talk things out with her too. I'd gotten so used to having her around that I think I started taking her for granted. And now that I didn't have her all the time... I was almost lost.

I hurried down to the kitchen and grabbed a bowl of fruit off the table. Hannah and Susan had their backs to me but I heard them yell as I ran out the door. I just grinned and kept on going. I was sure Lavender wouldn't eat everything in here.

I got up to the infirmary and walked in. It was completely silent. I thought maybe she was just still asleep and I walked over and opened the door to her room. The bed was made and looked like it hadn't been disturbed.

Where could she be? She wasn't in Gryffindor tower... She was only ever there when she was with me. And she wasn't here in the infirmary. I turned and looked around the room and then saw the note posted to the door that I had somehow missed on my way in. I grabbed it off the door and read it.

<i>I have been called away on urgent business. If you need assistance, please find one of the professors. I am not sure when I will return. The professors will take care of any medical emergencies in my absence. Physical examinations will be rescheduled as soon as I return.

Lavender Brown, CMW</i>

The bowl of fruit dropped to the floor and I stood there, looking at the note. She left. She left and she didn't even tell me she was leaving. Maybe I was completely wrong about how things were between us. Maybe she didn't really need anything more from me than a shag every now and then.

I sat down on the edge of the nearest cot and just stared at the note. Lavender was gone and for some reason, I felt more alone now than I had in the past month."

"event","The picture on the front of the Daily Prophet glared up at me. I knew it was Tonks mission before I even got that far. I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach as I realized that one of the dead aurors could have very well been her. And the last thing I would've told her was to go away.

I threw the paper down and grabbed paper and a pen. I debated for a long while as to what to say. What should I say? In the end, the only thing I said was that we needed to talk. That would just have to suffice for now. Once I figured out where she was and when she was coming back, the rest of the details could be worked out.

I laid back on my bed and thought over the past few days. I'd managed to have an argument with Tonks, Lavender, and my father. And my father was really the only person who actually deserved to get yelled at. Now none of them were speaking to me. Maybe I should go find Lee and piss him off so that everyone would be mad at me. And then I could always piss off Oliver just for good measure.

But fighting with Tonks... That one just hit so much closer to home. She was my last remaining link to Fred. If I didn't have that... No. I wouldn't think about not having that. She WOULD come back and we WOULD talk things out. I wasn't going to let her slip away just like Fred did. I know that somewhere in there, she wasn't as mad at me as it seemed. And I knew I wasn't as mad at her as I thought. Truth be told, she had only told me the truth when she called my relationship with Lavender into question. I'd have to do some thinking on that too. That is, if we still had a relationship. With Lavender not currently talking to me, it wasn't something I could easily answer.

Only time was going to fix any of this. The easiest rift to fix was going to be the one with Tonks. Lavender might take some work. And my father... Well that one might never be the same, but it wasn't really my fault. I'd start with Tonks. I needed that part of my life back. Funny how the person who changes the most has been the one constant in my life."

"event","Is it just my imagination or do I have an uncanny way of making females absolutely hate me? First I get in a fight with Tonks and then I get in a fight with Lavender ABOUT my fight with Tonks. I mean, damn it all to hell, but doesn't Lavender realize that I argued with Tonks because I was defending whatever it is we have. I mean yeah, it's a relationship, I just don't know what kind. I thought maybe it was more than a purely physical relationship but maybe I'm wrong.

My hand is still throbbing. I guess I shouldn't have pissed Lavender off when she was fixing me up. Without the pain numbing charm, last night was practically unbearable and this morning was even worse. Everytime I moved pain shot through my hand.

I groaned as I sat up from my reclined position on the couch in the Gryffindor common room. I honestly didn't want to alienate the two people who were closest to me at the moment. I missed Tonks friendship and Lavender... Well I missed a lot of things about Lavender but telling her what I missed the most would probably just inspire her to bring more pain to my already throbbing hand. But maybe I could at least attempt to fix things and then she could attempt to numb the pain."

"event","Bloody hell I don't even have time to breathe anymore. Between taking care of the bloody animals and bloody guard duty I'm about beat to death. And then McGonagall tells me she has a project for me if I'm willing. How much can ONE PERSON do before they keel over and die from stress induced insanity?

And if that wasn't enough, Tonks decided to grace me with a reply. She bloody well took long enough to do it. I was just making my way down to the barn when her owl caught up with me. I pulled off the note and read it.

<i>G

You seem to think that I am somehow to blame for your sudden lack of the appropriate feelings for Lavender yet I am also the one you want to help you find them again. Maybe I read your last correspondence incorrectly but I don't think I'm the person you need to be talking to about this.

I'm going back to headquarters tonight. Maybe I'll be back soon - or maybe I won't.

T</i>

Headquarters. Well at least I knew where she was. But who the hell did she think she was to undermine my feelings for Lavender? So I don't feel this is something I can tell her. BIG BLOODY DEAL! It's not like Lavender knows the innermost workings of brain. Fred was the only one who knew that and he's gone. Tonks is the closest one after Fred who could even possibly understand me, and now she's acting all pissy.

I hadn't realized how angry I was getting until I looked down and realized the note she had sent was now crumpled into a tiny ball in my fist. I threw the paper down and apparated to the M.O.M. with a crack"

"event","Well Professor McGonagall seems to think I'm capable of being a castle guard. I certainly hope she's right. I'm so afraid I'm going to let everyone down. Just like with Fred. How good of a guard can I be if I let my twin fall?

And a meeting with other members of the inner council about other things they need my help with? I wish I could tell Lavender about my fears, but I don't want to seem weak in front of her. 

Tonks. She's the only one I can go to. She's known me long enough that I feel comfortable going to her. But come to think of it, I haven't noticed her around in awhile. Of course, I haven't been actively looking either. One track mind as of late...

I'll have to remedy that. I'll go find McGonagall and see if she knows where Tonks is. She's the closest thing to a best friend I've got right now."

"event","I think I finally dozed off around 2am. I guess Lavender wasn't going to come tonight. I tried not to let disappointment hit me hard, but I couldn't help it. I'd wanted to see her so badly. I understand she has an infirmary to take care of, so maybe she was just delayed with a patient. Maybe she'll come later today. Or maybe she gave up on me since I haven't been around much lately. If so, definately killing Malfoy..."

"event","Bloody hell I was going to murder Malfoy if he ever showed his face around here again. Running out and telling Gin to put ME in charge of the animals! If it hadn't been for the look of complete sadness on Ginny's face, I wouldn't have done it. I'll have to find out why she was so upset.

And then there's Lavender. Bloody well haven't seen her in three days! Maybe four... My sex-deprived self had lost count. Not that shagging her was the only reason I was frustrated. I actually liked having her around. And since I'm in the barn all the time she hasn't been sleeping in my bed at night.

Perhaps I'll have to remedy that. I mean, am I a wizard or am I wizard? Not only that, but part owner of the most successful joke shop in the wizarding community! How hard could it be to charm all the animals food to replenish itself? And to charm their pens to clean themselves?

I decided to get to work on finding a charm like that first thing tomorrow morning. Maybe I'd ask Gin for help. She was always bloody brilliant when it came to charms. I'm sure she could find something.

But tonight... Tonight I was going to have Lavender with me once more. I smiled as I headed towards the Gryffindor common room. I'd send her an owl and get cleaned up. Tonight would be a night to remember."

"event","If only Lavendar could've once again brushed off her duties in the infirmary. Yesterday was... well, it was great. All day in a bed with Lavendar. That girl has definately got some stamina. I'll have to keep this one around.

It's that thought that causes me to pause. These past days with Lavendar had been amazing, but where was it going? I don't think you could say we were dating because we couldn't exactly do anything. Right now it was mostly just shagging and snogging. Not that I was complaining, but I was beginning to think it wasn't enough. Like there should be more.

I read the notice up in the Great Hall and grinned. So, Lavendar was having to do physical examinations on everyone. At least I knew my physical examination would be more indepth than everyone else's. I penned off a quick owl to reserve my ""appointment"" and then headed outside.

I shook my head as I saw Draco down at what was now a barn, full of animals. Who would've thought that snarky git would buy animals and run a farm? The thought was enough to make me laugh. There had to be more than just not wanting to be his father that caused this change in him, but I was lost as to what could make Draco change THIS much. It was rather unnerving.

I continued walking down the hill and sat down underneath a tree by the lake. As usual, Lavendar was at the front of my thoughts and I sat there for the better part of the day just thinking about her."

I feel like she's pushing me away. I can't let her do that. She's the one tie I have to Fred's last living moments. She was the only other one that was there. If she leaves, it will be like reliving Fred's death all over again."

Lavendar's been giving me weird looks. Of course, that could be because of the huge bruise I'm sporting from where Tonks decided to smash my face in. That girl is going to be the death of me..."

I sit here all day. Nothing to do. Except the little filling that they make up for me. It's so aggravating. My father doesn't care-- he say's this is my punishment, but damn. It's been over a month. At this point it's totally sensiless.

It's just really starting to get to me. I have to do my best to not start crying.

I'm just venting.

"event","Another day.

My days all blur together-- each feeling similar to the day before it. I'm pretty content. I wish the sun would come out so I could go swimming. I'm very tired, but I can't seem to find sleep. I hate my job. I'm so full it's disgusting. I downloaded a bunch of 90's music tonight-- flippin sweet.

I complain about being in a rut, but I really can't bring myself to do anything about it. I think I'm becoming really shallow. I used to want to change the world, but now I just want to go shopping. Maybe I'm all the smarter for setting my sights on a much more reasonable goal. Who wants to devote their lives to something that might not work out-- when they have a guarentee doing something else. Maybe I'm not noble enough. Maybe I don't want it enough. My days are filled with magazines and counting my carbs. Have I stopped and actually lived life. What does ""living life"" entail. Is one ""living life"" when he's out getting drunk, or does the act of ""living life"" occur when one does things that makes him happy? With the latter theory shopping makes me happy-- therefor I'm ""living life."" I really don't have any desire to really do anything. I'm not depressed-- tired? YES. That's what happens when you don't sleep.

I never imagined my life would be like this. I like my life-- I wish I laughed more. I wish I knew fun things to do that don't entail drugs or alcohol, or something so boring like the movies, or going out to eat. I think we are all caught up in the same ridculous cycle. What has our lives come to-- we feign social interaction merely to pass away the time.

I'm so ready to get out of here. Georgetown-- I cannot wait. It's going to be amazing-- never before have I been in a place where there are people like me. People that understand my sistuation because they are going through the same thing themselves. People with my abitions-- my dreams. I still have a while until I embark on this ""new world.""

I'm tired. I'm going to go lay down. I have to go to the doctor in the morning, and get a shot :(

"event","So I'm home from Presidental Classroom. The program it self left a lot to be desired. Congress was in recess-- therefore I didn't get to meet anyone of importance. The speakers were hit and miss. The one thing that I adored about the progam were the people. The core group of people I spent time with were amazing. They all made laugh so very hard, but at the same time we could discuss issues of importance. I'm going to miss them. Road trip anyone?

I got in this morning about 10am. I then proceeded to sleep all day. This explains why I'm awake right now. I slept at least eight hours. Tonight I ate South Beach bars, drank diet coke, unpacked, and watched Sex and the City. I kinda wish I could fall asleep.

I feel distanced from my friends at home. It's not them-- that I know. I think it's me-- i've changed, and I'd like to think for the better. I feel better as a person. They always tell you when you graduate you begin to lose touch with the people you swore to talk to forever, but I didn't think it would happen so soon. Then the question comes do you try to salvage the relationship, all the while knowing that you are all still going to go your seperate ways-- off to live <strong>very</strong> seperate lives. I'm trying to balance my cynical tendecies with my need to be optimistic.

I'm not too sure. It's much to late for these thoughts.

I'm at this presidental classroom thing in DC. It's not too bad. I'm one of the oldest people here-- go figure. My suitcase didn't get here until like 10 last night. I was freaking out so badly. I mean I was by myself in a strange city with none of my stuff. You would freak out too. My dad got made at me because I was upset. It really didn't make any damn sense. Then I got hungry, and all of my akin's friendly food was in my suitcase. Then I more or less had an emotional break down-- crying. I have my stuff now.

Well I have to go. I'm bout to go meet Ralph Nader. har. har. No seriously."

Last night I was looking on the bag and in small print the bag reads: <strong>""Excessive comsumption may have a laxitative effect.""</strong>

I was so mad/sick. Then yesterday I was trying to sleep, and my father called me because he's at the airport, and has forgot his passport. I had to speed to the airport at 8 am in the morning. I was so sleepy, but then I got a surge of energy. My grandmother and I went to Phipps and Lenox. I love shopping-- even when I'm ill. I ran into Julie at the mall. She of course had an article of my clothing on-- <strong>bitch</strong>-- I still love her.

I really don't have anything to do today. Once again a total waste of my time. AP Results come in on friday! I'm exicited.

Well this is kinda a waste of an entry. Everyone call me on Friday. I have a month worth of roll over mintues to use. Oh yeah I have a new layout-- it's pretty much the best layout <s>ever</s> I could find.

"event","Another wonderful, fantastic day at work. Damn. I'm not even going to pretend. In all honesty today hasn't been half bad.

For the first time in a long while I'm not listening to Copeland. Instead I'm listening to Lindsay Lohan's CD-- I know I shouldn't admit stuff like that, but I really don't care. 

It's almost lunch time. Yay. I really love this Greek Resturant, even though the creppy, greek owner stares at me. The Greek Salad though is amazing. That's what I had for lunch, dinner, and my midnight snack last night.

I really like the point that I am in my life. I really like where my mental focus is, and the direction in which I'm heading. I mean if I had it to do all over again I wouldn't have gotten in trouble, but I mean I'm kinda glad I did. It was a much needed reflection time. I was moving so fast that I never stopped to focus. So yay for that. 

Six days until freedom. Dear Lord, I cannot wait. I'm sure next week will creep by slow as hell. I was trying to think of somethings I need to get accomplised this weekend, but I can't think of any. I was thinking about going through my stuff, and beginning to pack some of it away. It might be a little to early for that though, but I mean I might as well do it when I have the time. I only have to work at this damn office until the end of July. Not <strong>too</strong> bad. That mean I have all of August to myself. My father let me go to the pool yesterday. It was so relaxing, and I finally got some sun.

I think at lunch time I'm going to go up to Lenox. <strong> (I stayed here all day) </strong> Fuck this.

"event","It's 11 o' clock, and I haven't done anything yet. I checked out some super sweet threads at Abercrombie.com and UrbanOutfitters.com. There truly is no reason for me to be here other than the fact that my father wants me to have a job to learn responsibility. 

I've listened to so much Coldplay over the last few days. They are most defn. one of my favorite bands.

I went to Barnes and Noble again yesterday. Julie was there. I haven't seen her in ages. It made me happy. I found out somethings that made me sad though. It's amazing the routes all of our lives take. I don't care what anyone say people watching is one of the most fascinating things one can do in life. I love people. I love their behavior. I'm not so much interested in the why side of behavior, but the consequenses of people's behavior. That's a big reason why I'm taking Sociology instead of US Political Sytems next year. If I could understand people, their behavior, and interaction between them and their world that would be super sweet. Then if I decided to go into politics that would be an amazing skill to have in my corner. Plus it's so fascinating.

I cannot wait until next Friday. Not only is in July 1st, but I'm taking that day off from work, and I'm going Shopping. I have to get suits and stuff for my DC trip which I'm leaving for on July 2nd. The 1st is goign to be a crazy day. Not only do I have to get ready for my trip, but I also have to spend time with all of my friends. I cannot wait to get my computer back. I miss it. Yesterday I offically commmited to rooming with Sacha. I'm so exicited. I'm really sure it'll work out for the best. I looked through the CHARMS thing and realized that there was not was that I could find a roommate that way.

Ah. Lunch is is one hour. I had a really hungry day yesterday, but I didn't gain any weight. Always a good thing. Tonight is BodyFlow. Yay! I love it. Afterward I'm prob goign to do an additional hour of cardio. Tomorrow is Pilates. Not as much fun, but still pretty sweet.

I had to change my layout again. The other one stopped working right. I like this one, but that box on the right doesn't match the rest of the page, and I cannot get it to match with out fucking the whole layout up. So if you can do it for me, let me know.

I hung out with TJ yesterday. We hit up Barnes and Noble-- Fun stuff. THe coffee smelled so very good, but now coffee for me.

I'm doing the low carb diet, and it's working perfectly. I'm also working out a lot. I think I broke my iPod last night. That pissed me off, but I was kinda planning on getting a new one anyway.

I pre-registered this morning for my classes. Yay. I'm taking an acting class-- halarious I know. CHARMS also started this morning, but I'm pretty sure I'm just going to room with the girl I met from facebook.

Well I have an half an hour left until I get off. Then I'm going to go to the bank, change, and then gym.

I have way too much time on my hands. I'm starting to question myself,
and obsesses over things that really don't matter. (Or not now anyway)
I was thinking about it. Do you have any I idea how boring it's going

epithany. I'm far more interested in majoring inAmerican Studies--
which is basically American Culture. Pretty sweet. I know I want
to be a lawyer, but I'm not so sure about the rest, before or after. I used to be so sure in what I wanted to do, but I have a feeling this is pretty

fine.

Another day at the office. For the most part it's not that bad. I really dont do anything.

I got to talk to Julie today. yay!! I bought thirty dollars worth of magazines last night. I can't help it. It's like I'm addicted to them. I almost hurt a lady as I lunged and grabbed the new issue of Elle. It didn't hurt that Lindsay Lohan is on the cover. It sucks when the main exicitement in ones life is found through purchsing a new magaine. It's simple, but sad.

I've decided to clean up my act. No drinking. No smoking. It's not going to be ""hard"" per se, but I can't help but feel like I'm going to be missing out. Even if I'm missing out on making an asshole out of myself. I mean, damn, that shit is the reason why I'm sitting here in this damn cubicle. I'm pretty sure I'll still be able to  have a lot of fun, and who's to say I wont decide to drink again at 21. I sound like such a prude. I mean I want to go to the best law school-- which requires the best grades.

I have way too much time on my hands. I almost took a practice LSAT exam. Yeah that test that I don't have to take for about three years. I'm a big dork.

Yesterday I started writing for the first time in a long while. I feel like all of my writings are so depressing, but that's what I'm good at writing. I worry that my writings are cliche and boring. That I'm tring to capture emotions that have been captured numerous times before. If I brave enough to let anyone read it then maybe I would know.

I cannot wait until July. I'm determined to make the most of July and August-- even if that means I dont sleep. So be it.

I have to work everyday Monday-Friday 9:30-4:00 everyday. It's not as bad as it sounds-- the day passes by pretty quickly. The work is not that bad either.

I fucked my whole summer up.
Oh well.

My spirits are surprisingly high given my circumstances. If you haven't heard I'm in trouble-- a lot of it. If you haven't heard about it ask a friend.

Even though I'm not allowed to use a telephone I'm keeping in pretty good touch with all of my friends. That's the one good thing about work-- ultimited telephone and computer access. Hopefull in another week my father will let me at least talk on the phone, watch TV, and surf the internet. 

The past six or so days I have been either:

<center>A. reading
B. woking out
C. eating
D. sleeping
E. etc.</center>

<strong><big> sounds exicited doesn't it</strong></big>

I have nothing left to do today, and I don't get off until 4.

Today a guy who works here and I were talking about music. He then goes to the back and gets a binder of MP3's. He then gives them to me, for no apparent reason. I now have the entire Beatles collection, Doors, Pink Floyd, and etc. I haven't even finished looking through them yet. On my way home tonight I'm goign to sttop by Target and buy a CD player. One would think with all my electronics I would own a functional CD player, but I dont.


Well I guess that's about it. I'm pretty bored, but hey at least I'm getting paid to sit here and be bored.'

Yeah. I'm still not allowed to watch TV, use the internet, or talk on the phone. Not until July 1st, and I go out of town on the 2nd. Damn.

"event","""People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; their feelings most of all. People talk about how great love is, but that's bullshit. Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if they're afraid to feel? Pain is meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain. But they're wrong. Pain is something to carry, like a radio. You feel your strength in the experience of pain. It's all in how you carry it. That's what matters. Pain is a feeling. Your feelings are a part of you. Your own reality. If you feel ashamed of them, and hide them, you're letting society destroy your reality. You should stand up for your right to feel your pain."" 
-- Jim Morrison 

""That's what real love amounts to- letting a person be what he really is. Most people love you for who you pretend to be. To keep their love, you keep pretending- performing. You get to love your pretence. It's true, we're locked in an image, an act- and the sad thing is, people get so used to their image, they grow attached to their masks. They love their chains. They forget all about who they really are. And if you try to remind them, they hate you for it, they feel like you're trying to steal their most precious possession."" 
-- Jim Morrison 

""The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on and individual level. It's got to happen inside first. You can take away a man's political freedom and you won't hurt him- unless you take away his freedom to feel. That can destroy him. That kind of freedom can't be granted. Nobody can win it for you."" 
-- Jim Morrison

"event","The Doors are amazing. The music is so moving, so deep, so devouring. Jim Morrison is a sex god. He died so young. So soon. The good always die young, does that make the the lucky ones?

Are they the lucky ones. Life is such a labor. Daily tasks. Goals. Acheivement. Failure. Love. Death. The same thing in and out. Imagine the after life. Is there a heaven is there a hell. What if we are living in hell? Imagine that. What are we being punished for? Am I being punished? Heaven I imagine as being just peacefull silence. Fighting would end. Done. Imagine that.

Dad: Where are you staying?
Me: The dorms
Dad: With a student? Are they Co-ed?
Me: Yes with a student. The bulidings are Co-ed, and the floors are single sex. (slight lie, I know)

Baah. What does he think this is summer camp. Oh well... 

Well I really should be reading for school, but I'm not. I have quite a bit of work to do before Monday.

Government: Study for test.
English: Finish ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" ard finish corresponding work.
Psychology: Finish Chapter outline, vocab notecards, and study for test.

I have a feeling Sunday is going to be a long night. Like I'm going to do <strong>ANYTHING</strong> while I'm at Georgetown. I'm sooo very tired of high school.

Well let me go read.

I am still so amazed, but I am also very much in love. You know how you always hear that crap about when you find the right college you just know. Well every word of it is true. Healy Hall literally took my breath away. Never before had I encountered people who shared my passions. The professors were great-- esp. Father Maher and Prof. Sealy. I was sitting in the auditorium when I knew it was the place to spend the next four years of my life-- I just started crying. The campus is beautiful. The curriculum is perfect. There I'll have so much academic freedom. I really looking foward to my ""Problem of God"" class. The surrounding city of Georgetown is perfect as well. Only a few blocks down is the <strong>BEST</strong> shopping ever, and all on one street. John Kerry lives down the street. 
<br>
I've run out of words to describe Georgetown.
<br>
All in all-- all I have to say is: <strong><big><big>PERFECT</strong></big></big>

Today I went and got my prom dress (no ticket, date, or ride but oh well). Then I went to H&M, (<strong>the best store in the world</strong>)and got a bunch of stuff. Tomorrow we are taking the train down to Georgetown. <strong>wow</strong>. I'm really exicited.

Well since I just need to pass away sometime I might as well get this off of my chest. I feel like I do not deserve to go to Georgetown. Why me? What have I done that's so fantastic? I've looked at all of these people with amazing sat scores, and grades and they were rejected. Why wasn't I rejected? Am I just lucky? Or do I really deserve this. All these people that are going with me, and they are so amazing. They are so similar to me-- so then again I feel maybe I do belong. 

This is me just ranting. I really don't have much to say. The train ride is three hours long. I have no clue what I'm going to do for three hours. I brought my psychology book, maybe I'll outline. Maybe I wont. I guess we will just have to wait and see.

Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side.

I've learned to hate Russians
All through my whole life
If another war starts
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side.

But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust 
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side.

In a many dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side.

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
If God's on our side
He'll stop the next war.

"event","1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth
control are not natural.

2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile
couples and old people cannot get legally married because the world needs
more children.

3. Obviously gay parents will raise gay children because straight parents
only raise straight children.

4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears's 55-hour
just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.

5. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and it hasn't
changed at all: women are property, Blacks can't marry Whites, and divorce
is illegal.

6. Gay marriage should be decided by the people, not the courts, because the
majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the
rights of minorities.

7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the
values of one religion are always imposed on the entire country. That's why
we only have one religion in America.

8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging
around tall people makes you tall.

9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior.
People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing
and can sign a marriage license. (oh... wait...)

10. Children can never succeed without both male and female role models at
home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.

11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage
has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social
norms because we haven't adapted to cars or longer lifespans.

12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a
different name are better, because a ""separate but equal"" institution is
always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as
well as separate marriages ."

"event","Help Change the World/""Pass it On""
Hi, my name is Joshua Brown. After reflecting on the past election and what is already going on since President George W. Bush has begun his second term, I have decided that it is time to do something and we cannot allow the world to continue in the current path of corruption and what may lead to destruction. 

President Bush is proposing to cut all the programs that help the kids who most need help. Including cutting 100% of Upward Bound and the TRIO programs funding and cutting 50% of the funding for Safe and Drug Free school programs! While keeping all of his tax cuts. Why don't Americans understand that they need to pay taxes so the government can work. 

Paying taxes so that those who need help can get it should be considered a Moral Issue. Helping people out of poverty should be considered a moral issue. Funding our schools and school programs to help all students in the next generation to succeed not just those who are lucky and are born into the right family should be a moral issue. 

Why isn't it? Because our country is run by corporate greedy men and women who don't care about the average person, they only care about doing what it takes to make other people look bad, win elections (or steal them, they don't care as long as they end up in office) and then use their office to help their friends instead of the American people who really need the help. 

I am not saying that all republicans are evil or that all democrats are good, I am just saying that President Bush and those in office are doing an injustice to America's children, America's poor, America's needy, America's teachers, America's parents, America's grandparents, and America's workers. 

Something needs to be done to make sure that President Bush gets very little of what he wants, because it is not good for America. Something also needs to be done to change the mind set of the American public. Why is it that the issues that concern people the most are if gays should get married or if a woman has the right to choose to have an abortion. 

These issues do not cause children to go without healthcare insurance, these issues do not keep students from having the chance to be successful, these issues do not make people be unable to pay for their prescription drugs, these issues do not cause people to go homeless or starve. 

If you want to know what Jesus would do, read the Bible. The moral issues he dealt with in his life were the greed of government and of people, that it is our moral responsibility to help the poor, to help the sick, to help the children who cannot take care of themselves. 

Let's stop spending so much of our precious time on earth with issues that Americans will never agree on and actually do something about the moral issues in America that we can do something about. We need to work to end poverty, to help every child be covered with adequate healthcare, help every child have the opportunity for success with access to good teachers, before and after school programs, Upward Bound, lets work to keep our children drug free, lets work together to get every person in America the food, clothes, and housing they need in order to have self-confidence needed to get a job and take care of themselves and their family, lets go back to taking care of our parents and grandparents when they get older instead of pushing them into nursing homes and talking to them once a week or once a month or a few times a year, and lets do something to stop the violence in our homes, schools, neighborhoods, country, and the world. 

This can actually be done if we would work together and get the power of the government on our side not against all the interest of those who make America great. I believe that with Gods help and with the will to change our world we can fight the evils that try to keep things the way they are. Government is not evil, politics are not evil, but Americans are allowing both to be used for evil. 

Please work toward doing something to change the direction we are going in. First look at yourself and change your own actions, then talk to your friends and family and help change their actions and tell them to do the same. If anyone remembers the movie ""Pass it on"" lets actually try this. You can copy and post my rant on message boards, send emails to your friends, print it and put it on bulletin boards. Another thing you can do is contact both your state and federal congressmen, your governor, the president, anyone public official with an email address and tell them that you want to them to support legislation, to fully fund programs which actually do help those who need help. 

One example of this is to email, call, or write a letter to your US Senator, US Representative, and the President to at least put the funding back in place to keep programs like Upward Bound, Safe and Drug Free school, and other valuable programs that help the next generation stay out of trouble, gain self-confidence, and learn that they can succeed and be a valuable member of our world. You will not only change the students who are affected by these programs but in a small way we will be working to change the direction of this country and the world. 

We have to do something and together I believe we can make the world a better place for all of us. I am begging you to help and and join me in a fight to change the world."

"event","Through the years internet, especially social media included has basically evoloved into a possible roadtrip everytime you're on it. Anything imaginable in text or image is possible in the click of a button and a wide imagination. There was Xanga, where us first ""21st Century Generation"" recall being all in the same place to be heard on the internet, or by your friends. Tell your thoughts, express your mind with the space of some internet data. There was Myspace, where everyone would find out what kind of music you liked and how truly liked you were by a person with their ""Top 8"" (later expanded of course) and eventually everything became more detailed and detailed on there too in terms of personal interactions with people (curious/jealous/bored teenagers would learn to do better research than the FBI) as it had to compete with, Facebook. Facebook seemed to go undefeated, the final level of mainsteam, universal social media, although now a lot of the hipsters and females have gone to Tumblr, where a big enough army is forming as we speak. 

But hey, isn't all of on Livejournal? Why aren't I on here more often? I could talk about pretty much anything on here. But yet none of my real life friends know about it."

So, please, please, please, let me, get what I want.
Lord knows it would be the first time.

I'd feel less lame if I wasn't just going with friends), I still search endlessly for a job, AND I'm finally going to a drive in for the first time this weekend. :B
What do you guys have planned this month?"

"event","Why people claim they ""didn't mean what they said"" just because they were mad.

To me, it's like what they're really thinking is ""I meant it, I just think it's too mean to say any other time than when I'm mad and don't care."""

"event","Sometimes I wonder if something scarring happened to me when I was a small child and somehow I blocked it out completely leaving only side affects. That would be the only explanation to why I'm so fucked up now. When I was in elementary school, I was outgoing, friendly, outspoken, adventurous, and loving. Then when I hit junior high I suddenly became a lot shyer than I used to be. I was afraid to tell people whats on my mind no matter how bad I wanted to, I fell to conformity, I only had a few close friends, and I freaked out when people tried touching me. Most of all, since then, I've just been extremely awkward. Now i'm in eleventh grade, I'm not so much shy anymore, just anti social, unless I'm in a good mood. I don't even care about talking to people anymore, but I mean when someone comes along that's great. I just don't try. I don't care when people touch me, but for some reason I can't even hug my own family. And I can't remember the last time I told them I love them. I just can't say it for some reason. What did someone do that's so unforgiving for someone with such a forgiving, careless nature like me? Why is everything so awkward for me? Why can't I call anyone or knock on the door? Then sometimes I think too much about it and break down which makes me feel like a crazy person which makes me even more upset and cry even more.. I just want to know why I started acting like this. Nothing that bad has ever happened to me and a friend once told me ""It's only awkward if you make it"".
I guess I just think too much. I just want to stop being so awkward all the time. It's beyond this SAD bullshit. It's the one problem that doesn't go away."

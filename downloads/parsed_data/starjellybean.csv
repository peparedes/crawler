To teach high school English and Drama
To have enough money to pay my bills and live comfortably
To have a healthy relationship
To be able to travel to visit my mom and sister and dad&nbsp;on the weekends, as often as possible
To be happy

Not unreasonable things to ask for. I will have them. I already have them. The universe is shifting. The change in conciousness and people's thoughts is a trend happening all over the world. The Secret, The Law of Attraction, the power to create our own reality and happiness...its all true and it all is to serve a purpose. It makes me feel good. My mom told me that she finally knows what God is. God is in all of us. It's energy, its oneness, its silence. She said ""It is the silence between our words."" And I choose to be happy and all obstacles and challenges are just lessons in how to survive and keep faith. Faith, a word that was dirty before, when it served as alliance to some man made institution, is no longer a dirty, empty word. Faith is in myself, in nature, in life. The world is changing and I will change with it. I respect myself and I want to be happy."

"event","<p>Talking to my mom is one the best, most refreshing, most relaxing things in the world. Especially after she's had a couple glasses of wine and I've had a few beers. She wants to go to India to a temple and meditate for a month. She is transforming her life, not caring what anyone thinks about her in the process. She knows what she wants and she is going after it, and she makes me feel like all I have to do is be myself and ""do"" me in order to be happy. All I have to do is know what I want and I can achieve that.<br /><br />I want to go back to school. I want to Master in Women's Studies. I want to write. <em>I want you, punkie</em>. I want to live in an apartment or house and not have to worry about paying bills.

"event","Lately I've been dreaming about my grandmother again. Ever since she died she has visited me in my dreams from time to time, popping up to say hello. Two nights ago she appeared in my dream in the first apartment I remember her living in, a place I haven't been back to in about 12 years or so. She came floating out of her bedroom, it's shades of Carolina blue beaming forth and setting the same atmosphere of calm I had taken comfort in as a child. I held her cold hands with their paper thin skin and she told me she was doing well, just tired from crossing over. We smiled at eachother and I told her how much I loved and missed her, and then I woke up.<br /><br />Today I decided to go back to the old apartment building. I remembered the name, Sunny Court, and that is was somewhere between Copans Road and Atlantic Boulevard, about twenty minutes north of where I currently live. I woke up and set out, worrying &nbsp;that I wouldn't remember how to get there. But as soon as I turned off the exit it all started coming back to me. I recognized the same car dealerships, small businesses, churches, neighborhoods, even cemetaries. I knew I was getting warmer when I saw the golf courses (my grandfather was a golf pro). Even funnier, I really knew I was on the right track when I saw the Long John Silver. Some of my earliest memories&nbsp;are of&nbsp;going to my grammy and pop pop's every Friday and getting Long John Silver for dinner. Back then it was delicious.<br /><br />I started to get very frustrated as&nbsp;I got closer to the beach and realized how built up the area had become. Obnoxious new high rises towered over old familiar landmarks and threw me off course. I found myself getting angry at the buildings...how dare these new kids on the block overshadow my memories. I knew if I could just find the Publix in front of the street I could find my way again, and I did.<br /><br />When I got to the building, I thought it looked a little different, as I figured it would. And the name had changed to Pompano Brentwood...very strange. I parked my car and walked down the hallway, past the pool. Even the pool seemed to be a different shape, and everything was slightly off. I got to the door of her apartment and looked through a window I knew wasn't there before. I looked in and tears welled up in my eyes as I realized that the whole interior of the apartment had been renovated. What had once been her charming, blue bedroom was now a stark white, tiled and mirrored tacky living room. I was so upset I turned around to leave, got back in my car, and then looked at the next building and realized I was in the wrong place.<br /><br />Sunny Court still stood, <em>exactly </em>the same as it had in my childhood. I think I went to the wrong place first because I couldn't fathom it looking unchanged after all these years. But there it was. Same uneven hedges with the little red flowers I would pick and throw everywhere. Same pink and white tiled walls. Same sidewalk made of coquina shells and odd geometric shapes. There was the kidney shaped pool I had swam in while my grammy, who never learned how to swim in her 90 years, sat on shore as lifeguard. Same little garden where I'd chase lizards until they got too close, and then I'd run away screaming and into her arms.&nbsp;<br /><br />I walked down the hallway, which seemed longer than I had remembered. Then again my parents usually carried me; that's how young I was when this was my home away from home.&nbsp;I came up to apartment 105...this was it. As much as I have missed my grammy, as much as I cried when she passed away, I don't think I understood just how much I missed her until this very moment. If I could just knock on the door and listen to her footsteps getting closer, listen impatiently as she turned the handle, and then throw my arms around her soft waist, bury my face in her apron...those days will never come again. But here I could remember it all the more vividly. At&nbsp;least this new resident was keeping it nice. There was a welcome mat outside the door with a lighthouse on it. Grammy would have approved.&nbsp;I couldn't see inside the little&nbsp;kitchen window,&nbsp;but there were&nbsp;boxes of tissues and a vase of orchids. Not her favorite flowers, but forgiveable.<br /><br />&nbsp;As I turned to leave, I walked by the pool and stopped to write down my notes. I was aware that current residents might be watching and think I was trespassing, but I felt that I had every right to be there. I felt like a real writer, taking in the surroundings from my past and snooping around old stomping grounds just to capture the perfect images. I know she would be proud of me. Worried, but proud. I stole a few rocks from the pool area as souveniers, and as I stood there for a few more seconds, I could swear I smelled lavender. She always wore lavender. It could have been wishful thinking, but she has made her presence known in so many little ways before, this was in no way out of the ordinary.<br /><br />I drove home with happy tears in my eyes and feeling accomplished. I looked up at the light posts and read the little saying on the flags posted on each one: ""Pompano Beach 2008...A Century of Building Brighter Tomorrows."" In my opinion, they should stop building and leave things the way they were. I think I'll go back in another 10 years, and I hope Sunny Court will still be there."

"event","<p>I just experienced Reiki for the first time. Reiki is this ancient Tibetan form of touch healing that is becoming popular again in New Age circles. My mom, her partner, my aunt, and some of my cousins go regularly. You sit in a circle and meditate while the Reiki Masters go around the room and put their hands over your head, neck, shoulders and other body parts. They send heat and energy into your body and help you to release negative energy and anything that is inside of you that is hindering you from achieving your best self.<br /><br />&nbsp;I'll admit that I would have been skeptical of something like this in the past, and it took me a while to get comfortable with it today. But I can honestly say that for the hour I sat there, listening to peaceful music with my eyes closed, I felt the heat from these peoples hands. I felt myself getting lighter, physically lighter, as weight was lifted off my shoulders. I felt so much vibration and energy inside of me that I became a bit dizzy and experienced the feeling of falling forward, which was pleasant for some reason. I felt my hands float up at certain times and my feet kick, none of it a concious action on my part. I felt&nbsp;like I was&nbsp;surrounded&nbsp;by white light and spirits, as cold brushes of air slipped past my&nbsp;face at certain moments. I also felt like I was splitting open from the head down, and that layers of myself that were uneeded were falling away from my body. It is difficult to describe because these really were physical sensations that may sound impossible, but I felt them. I would reccomend this experience to anyone.<br /><br />&nbsp;There were people there of all ages and backgrounds. There was even this adorable little baby, about one year old, who sat in the middle of the circle and when&nbsp;someone said ""Reiki"" to her she closed her eyes and put her hands on her head and breathed deeply. Everyone there, and everyone in general, suffers from something, whether it be physical, emotional or both. This is a form of alternative medicine and I must say I truly believe in it now. The physical sensations and the relief that I felt were so powerful that I was moved to tears...which, if you know me, is not uncommon, but these were gentle tears of relief and gratitude for all of the good things in my life and everything that I experienced in the moment.&nbsp;<br /><br />My mom is going to become a Reiki master and my other relatives are already in courses to do the same. I plan on going back and doing it again. I sent out some of the energy to certain people today, hoping they would feel the vibrations and the love that I sent them. I hope they felt it. I really feel a lot better about myself and I saw things that I needed to see while meditating. I think the more I do this, the less confused I will be as clarity sets in and I figure out what the next step is going to be in my life.</p>"

"event","<p>If you have not yet listened to and watched Barack Obama's speech on Race and Unity in America, I plead with every one to do so. It may be long, but I promise that it only gets into your heart and under your skin more and more as the minutes go on. Never have I heard a politician speak so honestly and so intelligently about something so important. Never has a politician's words made me cry tears of hope and joy. This is the reaction you will hear from millions of people across America, from every racial background. Here is the link to the first of the four parts of the speech:<br /><br /><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=o1uJztFbOk8&amp;feature=related"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=o1uJztFbOk8&amp;feature=related</a></p><p>There isn't much more I can say that he doesn't say in the speech. He tackles issues and brings to the public ear issues that I don't think the average white American has considered, or even&nbsp;some black Americans for that matter. That is, he talks about racial tensions and the progress that we have made along with the challenges we still face so candidly, in a way that&nbsp;I don't believe the American public as a whole has ever encountered. I have only had such discussions in the college Race and Gender classroom, or with small gatherings of black and white friends who were courageous enough to talk about these sensitive issues. We cannot be afraid to talk about it, and that is the point Obama makes...one of many points. If we want change, we have to confront these issues out in the open. Everything he says is true here...I just hope that voters will open their minds and realize that this is the person we have been waiting for to bring us closer together as a people.<br /><br />Between&nbsp;Obama's speech and Marlee Matlin, a deaf actress ( a la the L Word, among other things) dancing on Dancing with the Stars, I am so inspired right now. She danced even though she cannot hear the music...something that has not been attempted before. She admitted she did not know how she would do, but she didn't care. And she was amazing. She felt that music in her body without having to hear it. I mean...there really is no meaning to the word ""can't.""&nbsp;<br /><br />Between those two things and other more personal things that have inspired me and given me hope this week, I really feel like life is amazing and that everything will be ok...to put it simply. </p>"

at least i dont have cancer...of the female kind. i was actually very, very concerned about this recently but i didny tell many people. and thought it was a good possibility, but found out today that I am fine. i want to live, even though part of me feels like i am dying, and so once again im glad i am cancer-free.

so much has happened in the past few days...got heart obliterated, again...went to a strip club for the first time...almost got a DUI&nbsp;(very close...it a miracle)...and i am just too exhausted to write about it all right now....but i will eventually and it will be brilliant and somehow help me heal from this.&nbsp;

tonight i had a friend do this psychic/tarot card-like reading on me, but having to do with one's inner angels and talking to one's guardian angels and the spirits around&nbsp;us. it was spot on...my friend&nbsp;started crying when she did hers and teared up when she did mine,&nbsp;and i wanted to cry but physically couldnt. i got a lot of the answers i was looking for. maybe someone is looking out for me after all.


in the end....no matter what happens....you are a part of me, and i still love you. i&nbsp;fucking more than love you. i always will.

"event","<p>So I googled myself ( shut up, you know you've done it too). It wasn't the first time but it was the first time in a while. And do you know what's interesting? Every single entry about me on google has to do with the newspaper that I dedicated so much of my life to for three years. What does that say about my identity?&nbsp;<br /><br />Once I decided that being a part of the mass media, the corporate media, was not for me, I guess a large part of my identity slipped away, just like when I decided that being a famous actress was not for me. It made me feel pretty lost, like if I saw a picture of myself today I wouldn't recognize me.&nbsp;<br /><br />I do not want it back. I do not want to be that actress, even though I will admit that I still sometimes model in front of the mirror and fancy myself on the cover of a magazine. I did enjoy acting, but what I enjoyed more was the idea that millions of people would accept me and love me, acknowledging and approving of who I was. I wanted that so badly because as a young adult I was so brutally attacked for who I was, what I looked like and what I wanted that it seemed becoming famous would be the perfect revenge. I know I'm not the only person who has felt this way. I know now that wouldn't fulfill me or make me happy. I still haven't found anyone who loves the little fat girl in me, except me. I love her now, but only because she no longer exists. She has been locked away with her mouth taped shut&nbsp;and almost forgotten about. Almost. <br /><br />And I don't want to be a part of the corporate media either. I don't want to be part of a giant machine that only stands to perpetuate lies and scribble out some purchased version of the truth. I am glad I got the chance to experience that on a small, college-level scale so I would know that it was not what I wanted to dedicate any more chapters of my life to.<br /><br />But googling myself today did remind me of what I do want. There was one news article that&nbsp;I wrote out of the hundreds that actually made a difference in people's lives, enough that the article was copied and pasted in people's blogs for others to see. That was the one about&nbsp;FAMU&nbsp;Homecoming and the racist reactions from police, student, and the town in&nbsp;general to the occasion.&nbsp;Dozens of people emailed me and thanked me for writing that article, and for the first time&nbsp;I felt like&nbsp;I said something that mattered.&nbsp;Someone wrote on their blog that for the first time the racial divide in Tallahassee had been acknowledged by a white person. I'm sure I wasn't the first to write about it or point it out, but the fact that I drew so much attention to it and got people of both races&nbsp;talking about it mattered. It still matters. But I wrote that article over a year ago and since then I haven't written anything thats made as much of an impact, or any impact. That's what I want and need to do. By this time next year, hopefully sooner, I want to google myself and find that I have challenged more people to think and discuss and maybe even do something to make positive changes.<br /><br />My identity, <em>my</em> identity, is based solely on my actions and what I do, what I achieve, what I stand for. Nothing and nobody can tear me down or tell me that I am less than I know I am. I choose to speak, I choose to write, I choose to love.&nbsp;I do choose to love, even when it would perhaps be easier to hate. I fucking choose to love, and even when its not returned, it does not take away from the fact that I love. I choose to love, but&nbsp; there really is no other choice. It is what it is. We love who we love. Maybe I should say I choose not to run away from love, even when its hard. I don't know. Anyway, I am going to wash my hair now and go out into the world feeling like I can do whatever the fuck I want and feeling good about it. I refuse to make any more apologies for who I am. I choose to be myself and I choose to like it.</p>"

"event","<p>I was listening to AM 940 WINZ in my car today, the progressive Air America affiliate in South Florida, and I heard this news brief about a trial in the case of a Haitian girl who was smuggled into the country at age 14 by a Miami family and forced into servitude. Here is a link to the full story: <a href=""http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking_news/story/432336.html"">http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking_news/story/432336.html</a><br /><br />Ok, so they put the word ""slave"" in quotation marks. I say fuck those quotation marks. This girl was beaten and kept from going to school while forced to work for 15 hours a day. Defense attorneys have said that the family claims they were ""just trying to give her a better life"". Are you fucking kidding me? Is that not an arguement that was used by slave owners and traders prior to the Civil War in this country? Whoever thinks that slavery and racism are things of the past in&nbsp;the United States is&nbsp;living in delusion.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is only one story, one story that happened to make the papers because it is set against the backdrop of a major Metropolitan area. Think about how many immigrants of a variety of races are smuggled into this country every day, or come into this country with the promise of making a better living for their families. I was shocked to learn that in Tallahassee, Florida, my state capital, there is an epidemic of young Asian boys being smuggled into the country and sold as sex slaves. This is fucking unacceptable. And what is almost as disgusting is that the majority of the oblivious politicians in Tallahassee, let alone the college students, haven't a clue as to what is going on just&nbsp;around the corner.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the sort of ""modern day"" slavery that you hear about more frequently, but not frequently enough. What barely gets any media coverage are the instances of what I will call ""traditional,"" or ""old-fashioned"" slavery....I'm talking white people enslaving black people slavery...that still persists in our country today. Just outside of Tallahassee, I was told of an elderly black man who ""worked"" for an elderly white woman.&nbsp;He was forced to open her car door wearing gloves and ride in the backseat while sitting on a towel because she did not want his skin touching&nbsp;anything she owned.&nbsp;How the FUCK is this possible you might ask? How is this allowed to go on? Why doesn't&nbsp;he just say no or&nbsp;leave?&nbsp;I don't know all the details. I just know that if this girl in Miami was smuggled into this country, kept uneducated,&nbsp;and forced into slavery, then&nbsp;I am&nbsp;certain she is not the first or the last.<br /><br />This shit is going on, and yet we have&nbsp;presidential candidates arguing over petty personal attacks against one another. Hilary Clinton called a press conference to shout ""shame on you Barack Obama"" over supposed negative or false information he put in a&nbsp;mailer&nbsp;about her&nbsp; universal health care plan. What a waste of time and energy. Why not focus on the issues, or discover that there are issues she doesn't even know about. Scream ""shame on you"" to the corporations who smuggle Mexican immigrants into Florida and force them to work for pennies&nbsp;to&nbsp;pick tomatoes and break their knee caps with hammers if they try to leave. Then fucking do something about it.<br /><br />We need someone in the White House who is aware of people who&nbsp;can't even be classififed as middle class or any class because they aren't even accounted for.&nbsp;I don't expect politicians to get over their own egos and wake the fuck up overnight. Every day citizens like myself need to wake up first,&nbsp;educate oursevles so we can educate the people in charge. I am&nbsp;starting to realize just&nbsp;how sheltered I was before I started paying attention to these things, and its scary. I am just now, at 23, taking an interest in politics and watching&nbsp;CNN and trying to sift through the bullshit to find out the truth. I enjoy cheesy reality TV and melodramatic soap operas as much as the next person, but I challenge people to just flip over to a news station for one night, or spend a few minutes reading the news on a Web site instead of checking your facebook or myspace.&nbsp;At least find out what problems are going on&nbsp;in your neighborhood, and then don't just talk about it, do something about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;That action of doing something about it instead of just talking about it is where I am still trying to improve, but you have to take that first step. If you are as outraged as I am that slavery continues&nbsp;to be a problem in my own&nbsp;city, &nbsp;you won't be able to hear about it and do nothing. This cannot be allowed to happen anymore. And for as shocked as I was when I heard this news on the radio today, I know we have a long way to go.</p>"

"event","I agree with Michelle Obama; for the first time in my adult life, I really am proud to be an American. For the first time in my life, I feel that choosing a president to vote for will not mean choosing for the lesser of two evils. I have actual admiration for both of the Democratic candidates after watching them debate tonight in Texas. Although I agree more with the way Obama has proposed to bring about change, I believe that either one of them would bring about the change necessary to make our country even greater. I feel excitement and hope.&nbsp; 

Its not that I ever hated American or was not necessarily proud of where I am from. But in the past few years, the&nbsp;reputation of America around the world has deteriorated, and for legitimate reasons (i.e. the war in Iraq, the unconstitutional torture, the warantless wiretapping and harassment of our own citizens). But now, with either Clinton or Obama, I can feel something changing. I know that either one of these individuals will make things better for us at home and for others around the world. Neither one of them seems to view America as ""the boss"" of other nations, but rather a leader of other nations. They prefer to take a look at ourselves and our own domestic policies and fix those rather than spend more trillions of dollars on telling other countries what to do.&nbsp; 

I could recap everything I watched tonight in the debate and give my opinion on why I think one candidate is better than the other, but I would rather my friends do their own research and get as excited about watching the debates as I have. The one screaming difference between the two candidates that I have to point out is that Obama and his campaign has not been at all about smearing the name of Clinton. He has focused on promoting himself rather than trying to bring her down, while she seems to be grasping at straws to try to make herself look better. But in tonights debate, although there was tension between the two, for the first time in a while&nbsp;I believed that these two could run together as a dream team of sorts. Watching them shake hands and really show each other respect at the end of the debate surely made&nbsp;this seem possible.&nbsp;That may be too hopeful at this point, but we shall see. 

** 

One other thing I realized tonight was how much I really have come into my ""adult life."" I spent the night laughing and drinking wine with my mother, having dinner with her and her partner, watching TV and surfing the Internet with my mom ( she just got her own lap top and is so cute with it).People have asked me why I didn't move to L.A. or if I regret not moving there, and tonight I was once again really happy with my decision not to move there. If I had, I wouldn't have had all of the experiences and developed the love and relationships that I have over the past few months. I also wouldn't have been able to strengthen the friendship that I have with my mom, and share these moments and evenings with her where I learn so much. She is truly amazing. She is taking Reiki healing classes,&nbsp;marching in breast cancer walks, studying philosophy and world religion on the computer in her spare time, and considering going back to school to get her B.A. either in one of these subjects or in early childhood education. That's on top of working 40 hours a week at a job it takes her an hour and a half to get to and from every day. &nbsp;She is 52 and she has overcome so much and continues to be a fighter and a survivor. She sometimes says she feels like it is a little late in the game for her to be going back to school or changing jobs, but she isn't letting that fear stop her from making changes in her life. I guess I just feel like my mom is fearless. I want to be fearless too, and because of her, I feel like I can do anything."

I've realized that life, unfortunately, doesn't stop for birthdays. When we are children, this one day means everything. And while it is the anniversary of one's entrance into this world, every day should be a celebration, because time just doesn't stop for that perfect day. We need to enjoy every second, every moment that we are blessed enough to be happy and be with each other.&nbsp;

Today is&nbsp;about taking charge of my&nbsp;life and realizing that&nbsp;I have the power and the choice to do whatever&nbsp;I can imagine.

Perhaps a lesson learned easily is not as rich as one learned very slowly, very painfully, over time. Maybe that is the only way it truly sticks.<br /><br />I do feel like the Universe is a bit smaller today, and that gives me comfort. Sark's idea that we are all stirring in the same bowl of soup rings true when so many friends in my life, both near and far, old and new, can in some way relate.&nbsp;<br /><br />I read something about a month ago that told me a certain someone in my life would make me realize things about myself that I did not want to face, would help point out my flaws, and that these pills of truth would be difficult to swallow. It also said that this person is to be one of the most important relationships I will ever have. I believe this now more than ever.<br /><br />I am learning. I am learning to step outside myself and truly be there for another. I am learning what love really is. I am learning how being there for someone can mean giving them space instead of holding them so tightly they cannot breathe. I am learning that being physically alone does not mean I am alone at all. I am learning to take care of myself so that I do not have to depend on another person for my sanity and happiness. I am learning how to be thankful for everything that I do have, instead of focusing on the things I do not.

I am human and I have to vent though, and this is my chosen venue. So if you don't want to hear it then you don't have to read it.

I wrote this at about 4 a.m.

*******************

***You know what, maybe you're right. Not about everything, but some things. I am a really fucked up person. I am not perfect, and I think that I have been afraid of admitting to my own faults for some time, trying to pretend to be perfect for the sake of someone else's sanity. And maybe you are sick of hearing about my so-called less than dire problems. Maybe it seems like I am always making everything about me. But this is my life, and my issues, as trivial as they may seem to others, are the things that I must conquer in order to become a better person. And everyone has to deal with their own issues before they can be any good to another person. So here we go.***

I unintentionally make things about me that are not about me, usually because I am trying to please other people so much and make things so perfect that I end up losing sight of what they really need.
I am over-sensitive.
I bring up the past at inappropriate times, like at family events and around children, and sometimes try to make a joke out of it, even thought its pretty clear that I have unresolved issues. I am trying to be open and honest and show my true personality, but I guss I just end up sounding really fucking crazy. 
I over-analyze things a lot.
I can be clingy.
I can be difficult to approach.
The list goes on...and on...

The bottom line is, I do not deny that I have a shit ton of things that I need to work on. I am 22 years old. In many respects, I am still a child. I have a lot to learn, but I am the first to admit to it. But don't even the most fucked up of us all deserve to be loved? I truly believe so.

I recently saw a film called ""Into the Wild."" It was a wonderful movie about self-discovery that, despite a tragic ending, made me feel pretty happy about life. The character in the movie had to go on this journey to find himself and find what was important in life. His family had its share of problems, but really not as bad as some people I know in real life. Still, he was fucked up emotionally and had to go on this quest. 

What is so different, I ask, about me trying to solve my identity issues and trying to sort out my family drama? Does the fact that I didn't disappear and go off into the woods to deal with my shit make it less romantic, less admirable? I already know that true happiness is sharing life with other people, so I figured I could learn and love at the same time. I chose to stick around and be there, as best as I could, for the person I'm in love with, even though the baggage I have can't help but sometimes weigh on my ability to be selfless. 

I'm just going to be unflinchingly honest from now on about everything, especially my own fucking hang-ups and emotions. 

Just to clarify...my problems make up only a small portion of who I am. I am also a really, really good person, and maybe my biggest fault is that I have so much love to give that it begins to suffocate me if I feel like I can't share it completely. I love other people so much more than I love myself...and that, believe it or not, is not healthy.

**I guess I just thought that if anyone understood being ""crazy,"" being slightly awkward, being someone that is not so easily understood...it would be you. We are so much more alike than you chose to admit. I am sorry if you feel like me having to deal with my own problems has ever overshadowed my compassion and desire to be there for you and your current, very serious and very difficult troubles. I just believe that where there is so much love, a little bump in the road every now and then is no big deal. You DEAL with it. But maybe there is so much other shit crowding your life right now that you can't deal with it. And if that is the case, I will still be here,a little better in my own right, when you feel like there's room for me.**

While I am not ready to move to NY right now, this sort of work strikes me as something I would LOVE to do.

I have so much to be grateful for. I have no regrets about moving to Jax. I did love it there. And I do love YOU. It just wasn't the right time.
I have so much to accomplish and so much work to do on myself and with my talents. 
Everything happens for a reason. Everything is an experience. I hope that this experience will lead me to where I am supposed to be, and I hope that it will lead us both to the same, better place.

I have much to write about. My heart is full of love and my fingers are just itching to relive every beautiful moment through words.

And right now, its a very interesting sensation.
What do you do when you know something so certainly in your heart and mind, but everything around you is a contradiction?
I want...

a new job. One that I care about. Or at least one that pays me the way it should.

a home of my own. A place where I feel completely comfortable going back to, a place where I can stretch out and let out a very deep breath, a place where I can cuddle and love and live absolutely free. 

more friends that are close by.

peace in my heart and soul.

I am going to read the Secret again. and again. Until feeling good is just synonymous with who I am.

So just call me my friends. Let me know how you're doing. Let me hear your voice. Help me remember myself, because with all of these changes I have moments when I feel like I am starting to forget.

It is life-changing and it will help you harness the powers you already have within yourself to bring about everything you desire. I am so happy right now and everything in my life is good. I feel good because I am thinking positive thoughts and know that I can have everything I want in life. I already do. That's the key. Also, go to www.zeitgeist.com and watch the movie. Another life-altering experience. It covers religion, 911, the future of our government and economy...stay informed. Do something about it. We have to act now.

On a more vain note...I am a size 6. What the fuck. I was a size 15 in October. I haven't been this thin since high school. No, I haven't been super healthy, but I am now. I eat when I am hungry and that's that. It works for me. If I can do it, anyone can.

Finally, I want you to own the station,
broadcast it back to her and everyone else

OK...Since so much is going on in my life, I thought I should make a real post instead of a poetry post. Though truth be told, most every key to my daily existence lies in those lines, sometimes more clearly than when I write in prose. But for those poetry-phobes out there( and I know there are quite a few of you and you should get over it), I'll write something less cryptic/crafted.

I'm currently a waitress at Village Inn. This is only to pay the bills for July and save money so I can afford to put a deposit on a place in Jacksonville. Yes, my plans have changed. I am moving to Jacksonville for a while, maybe a year or two or more. There are some things I've figured out lately that make this decision make even more sense than it did when I originally decided it.

1)I believe that family and friends and love is going to have to take a front seat to fame and fortune, at least for me. I don't need to sell my soul to make art that the masses won't appreciate anyway. I don't really want a swarm of nosy reporters (how ironic) watching my every move and documenting my every shit if I should happen to get arrested, or happen to have a child, or happen to walk down the street. That level of fame is no longer important to me. I don't need that to feel successful. I will feel much more successful reaching fewer people and making a deeper impact on those few individuals than spreading myself thin and transparent for the general population.

2) Where I end up living is not nearly as important as what I end up doing and who I choose to surround myself with. There are ample opportunities in places where I don't have to exile myself from the love and inspiration and the people that drive me. So...Jacksonville? L.A.? New York? Fucking Canada or Japan? Maybe I'll live in all those places. So long as I am doing something important and loving every minute of it.

3) When you have to consider working at Dominos pizza as a delivery girl because you are that desperate to pay the bills, you realize that moving across the country when you have no money is just dumb. When you have to work as a waitress at a place where you get taken advantage of for being intelligent, you realize that having to work a job like that is only bearable if when you get off from work, you have someone amazingly comforting and delicious and exciting to go home to. And smoke with. And get drunk with. And laugh with. And I will probably be working these mindless-type jobs for quite a while, because I refuse to not have the time to dedicate to writing what I really want to write instead of writing what some huge, undoubtedly biased corporation tells me to write.

4) Many things have brought me to these conclusions, not just the obvious. Over the past few years...my mom's cancer, my sister's accident, my grandmother's death, and many other things have made me realize how important family is. Then being around someone else's family in a time of need showed me once again how family,as confusing and complicated as it can be at times, is the most rewarding, most fulfilling source of happiness and inspiration. So I want my family to extend, I want it bigger, and I want it as close as possible for as long as possible.

5) That said, every time I have changed my plans in life, I have only found more strength and experience and love and passion than I would have if I had stayed with the original plan. So...while theatre is fun and acting is a wonderful distraction from a sometimes unbearable reality, there is too much work to be done in the real world for me to dedicate my life to the stage or screen. If those things come somehow, sweet. But my calling is to write. To write poetry. To write prose. To write the things people are afraid to fucking say when they most need to be said. I want to bring people to their feet the way Staceyann does, and I want my feet to always be moving. 

Basically, I've decided that I can have it all. Readjustments may be necessary to make this possible, but I will make it possible. I will:

1)write truthfully and passionately about things real and imagined in order to stir people up, make people laugh, and propel them to act 
2)make life better for the LGBT community and other disenfranchised peoples
3)make my way around the world, even to Antartica, just like my Nana
4)make a certain special someone feel loved,safe,happy,excited and proud to be my partner for the rest of her life
5)make a baby...or two...most likely. Unless I decide its too selfish or I'm too crazy. 
6)try to make every day the best day of my life...to the point where its hard to top each one with the next. 

And when there is a bump in the road, realize that yes...yes...everything will always be ok(:

Yep. That's about it. For now.

"event","I have way too much to say. Updating should not feel like I have to make up for all the work I've missed. It's not fucking homework that's been backed up. I've been too busy living life to write about it. But...I am a writer, so, I need to make the time.
I'll just give the highlights for right now.

a. I have a girlfriend, and she's pretty fucking bad ass. <3

b. I'm graduating in two weeks. Doing school work has become unbearable. This case of senioritis is one step above just giving up and dropping out weeks before my goal is met, but I'm not that big of an idiot. I just put everything off until the day before and cry about it and then magically end up getting it done, because I am a super hero or sorts. And I have great moral support in the form of a hott, lovable, witty amazing girl who is kind enough to sleep next to me while I'm typing away like a fiend.

c. I refuse to work for a newspaper that sucks my soul away like the one I've been working for has. It was a great experience, my resume is built up if I need to pursue that option, but I refuse to ""play the game"" of trying to work in corporate America just to pay the bills while I put all of the things I'm passionate about on the back burner. Not gonna happen. So, I'm gonna move to LA and look for jobs in the city as a writer, editor or bath product expert (mmm Lush) and write my shit in my free time and go on auditions very frequently, and perhaps take some acting workshops/classes. I'm gonna sleep in a sleeping bag on someone's floor or couch (Jed...does the offer still stand??) until I can afford a place. But this isn't happening until August, because I'm not ready just yet. And I don't know if I'll be ready then, but it's time to throw myself off the deep end. 

d. I had two nights of inspiration this past week that made me feel a lot better about the future. First, we went to Gainesville to see Staceyann Chin, my favorite poet and friend who stayed with me last semester. She and I have kept in touch and it was wonderful to see her perform once again and spend some time with her. That woman is a no bullshitter. She tells you how it fucking is whether you like it or not, and I appreciate it, even if it makes others uncomfortable. Life is too short and to ripe with better things to do than to be comfortable all the time. She talked about how she doesn't ""play the game,"" and she may not be rich but she has made a name for herself doing what she loves, and she wakes up every morning feeling proud of her choices and who she is. I want that. I refuse to settle for less. THEN...oh man...Mr. Belding, aka Dennis Haskins from ""Saved by the Bell"" came to speak to FSU students and he was freaking hilarious and also one of the sweetest, most genuine men I've ever seen (Heather, I thought of you the entire time!) He talked about the show and lots of behind the scenes gossip, but he also talked about taking chances and trying to follow your biggest dreams or you'll never know otherwise. He said to get rid of the ""no"" people in your life and find the ""yes"" people who will support you in your endeavors, even if they are out there. He asked if there were any theatre majors there and so about five people stayed afterward and he talked to us and gave us advice. He also said I should go to kareoke with him at Dimples in L.A., haha. 

e. Last night was Alternative/Gay Prom and I won Prom Queen. It was pretty surreal...I mean, who would have thought the fat girl from middle school would end up being Prom Queen. True, it wasn't high school Prom, and yeah, people voted repeatedly, but you have to build your own context for fitting in. I fit in with the people that matter. And better than winning, I got to spend a night with the people I love and dance and laugh and eat fucking brie cheese. It was sweet.

Ok, that was long. I need to write poetry. More to come soon!(:"

I was talking to one of my best friends earlier and I told him that I feel like I am about to take a step off of a cliff into a massive abyss without knowing what will be there to catch me. There is no logical next step...there is no thing that I now 'have' to do. It's all my choice. It's all on me. And while I know that I will succeed, while I know that I have the tools and the talents to build whatever future I want, walking out into the unknown is still terrifying.

I have felt a little bit uneasy for the past few days and those who have been around me and know me the best have felt it and called me out on it...ok, so just one person did. And rightfully so. I couldn't really pinpoint what was bothering me exactly at the time, but now I do. 

I have always had this fear that all of the people that I love the most, the people that I would do anything for, would die for, are going to abandon me. I have felt this way ever since I came home one day in the second grade to find out that my father had abandoned me, my mother and my sister through his actions...it was months before I could talk to him or see him again because visitation and phonecalls were not allowed. When I did finally get to visit him, it was always in a room full of crowded people, other inmates and families, not the environment in which a father could ever have a real conversation with his daughter. Since he's been out, our communcation has improved, but it has never been great. Sometimes it still feels like we are in a room full of others, even when its just the two of us.

So my paranoia, my oversensitivity, my anxiety about people abandoning me is very real, even if the chances of them actually walking out of my life are slim to none. Its not an excuse for the mood that I get into sometimes, or the pressures I put on other people, especially my friends. You are so precious to me...I don't know what I would do without you. I am so nervous about moving away and losing touch...even though I know that the bond we share cannot be stretched or weakened by distance. It's scary. And I'm sorry if my fears come out as anger, or impatience, or whatever else. The last thing I want to do is push people away when I am already terrified of losing them. 

What I need to do is calm down, show my love and thanks for your support and your friendship, smile and laugh and not make a scene, not blow things out of proportion. Deep down inside, I know that I am loved in return and that not everyone is going to let me down. I know that no matter what life throws our way, true friendship and true love does not melt away when times get rough. It is the rough times that show us what our friendship is really made of.

As frightened as I am, it's worth taking that step into the unknown. Because I truly believe it is the strength we show when we step out into the abyss without knowing what is going to catch us that makes us who we are. It is experiences like this that teach us how to catch ourselves."

"event","This evening as I walked with a friend of mine,
arm in arm as we're apt to do, 
discussing life's ups and downs,
in particular the ups of lesbian sex 
and the downs of lesbian heartbreak,
which all too often lead from one to the other,
we were stopped by a young blonde woman, 
a Sister so-and-so, 
with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints.  

She asked us how we were doing this evening
and we told her we were fine the way you
tell an old friend who is supposed to know better.
She didn't know better.
She said she stopped us because she could tell we both
shared the same passion and love for her lord and savior.

My appearance may not scream athiest,
or dyke,
but I don't believe it screams Bible-thumper either. 
Then I remembered the cross I carry on my chest, the silver
one that represents more to me than any religious symbol ever did.
This stolen iconography I have chosen 
to reinterpret for myself
as a variation of the female symbol.
For me, it stands for my sister and my mother
who wear the same cross.
Family is the only religion I currently subscribe to.

My friend was wearing a cross as well
and it meant more to her than
I can claim to sum up in a few pretty words.
But it did not mean she wanted to go to this woman's church.

I stared blankly past the Sister,
aware of my rudeness but unable to contain
the discomfort at being pegged for anything
other than how I identify,
and I thought about how some straight men who
know how to dress and 
how to cook and 
how to dance might feel,
and how some straight women who don't wear makeup 
and might love soccer
and might not have a boyfriend might feel
when they are pegged for something they are not.

Then again, I didn't lash out at this 'other'.
I did not condemn her with my apathetic eyes
while she tried to sympathize with me over
doctrines I would never understand.

As we politely told Sister we had to
be on our way, the urge to grab my friend 
and kiss like lovers entered my mind.
I didn't do it,
but I will always wonder: if I had,
would we still have been welcome at services on Sunday?

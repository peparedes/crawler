"event","Thursday evening (Japanese time), the new opening to Pocket Monsters: Advanced Generation aired.

Thursday evening (Arizona time), I watched and translated it.

I've already posted it on three forums, but given the history those sites have had with going down, I'm also putting it here.

In case of future plagiarists trying to claim this work as their own, let the record show that the following translation is the original work of Murgatroyd.

<i>ikukkyanai yarukkyanai
makekkonai tomaranai saigo made
hitori ja nai samishikunai madamada
WAKUWAKU bouken owaranai...
KIRARI asahi KINAGI TAUN
kyou mo genki ka? PIKACHUU
yaruki genki RYUKKU ni tsumete
ORE wa kyou mo chikau yo
PINCHI to CHANSU URA-OMOTE
katsu mo makeru mo ORE shidai
tsuyosa yasashisa mabushii egao
mune no MAP de mitsukeru ze
motto motto takaku
mezase ORE wa CHARENJAA!!
ikukkyanai yarukkyanai
makekkonai tomaranai itsu datte
sasaetai mamoritai kimi ga kizutsuita toki wa
furimukanai utsumukanai

I must go, I must do it
I will not lose, I will not stop, until the end
I am not alone, I am not lonely, still
This exciting adventure does not end
The rising sun flashes, Kinagi Town
Are you well today, Pikachu?
Enthusiasm and spirit in my pack
I make my vow again today
Danger and opportunity, both sides of the coin
Victory and defeat, both depend on me
Strength, kindness, a sparkling smile
I will find it using the map in my heart
I aim higher and higher,
I am the Challenger!!
I must go, I must do it
I will not lose, I will not stop, ever
I want to support you, I want to protect you, when you are hurt
I will not turn around, I will not bend my head
I will not be discouraged, I will not give up, I believe
I cannot be impatient, I will not panic, always
I will aim for the distant dream"

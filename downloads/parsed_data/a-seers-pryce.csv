I am very excited to hear that Amy is going to be in Arizona for at least part of the summer, because I am also going to be there for my sister's graduation and about a week after that.

"event","The other night, I had the strangest dream, and I thought I would share.

It started out with me being called to the police station, where I was met by Greg Sanders from CSI, who told me that my sister Tori had been found beaten up in her home and was now sleeping in recovery.  I asked him where they had taken my son, because it turns out that in the dream I had a one year old named Noah that Tori was watching for me while I was at work.  He told me that no one had found a baby. 

So I was freaking out. A LOT.  Driving everyone crazy with my near-hyperventilation.  They wouldn't let me wake Tori up to ask her what had happened to Noah.  

Then, the scene flashed to Greg and other CSIs going to Tori's neighbor's house to ask her if she'd noticed anything strange going on.  She answered the door holding a baby, and Greg immediately caught on and asked if he was hers.  She said no, that her neighbor had come over to her house suddenly and asked if she would watch him.  Greg told her that he had the mother at the police station and would bring Noah to me.  He did.

It turned out that Tori's boyfriend had called and threatened her, so Tori took Noah to her next door neighbor's house but didn't leave herself for some reason.  He then came over and they got in a fight with foreseeable results.  All ended happily.

So, I thought that was oddly specific and mildly realistic for a dream.  It could have been an actual CSI episode if there had been any, you know, investigation.  So anyway, crazy, eh?"

"event","Okay, so I'm exaggerating.  (I've been told that I do exaggeration incredibly well.)  People sometimes stalk me on trolleys.  It's happened at least three times.  (Does Daniel Count??)  I'm on the blue line trolley to Old Town attempting to read Toqueville and instead staring out the window blankly when I notice that the guy who's sitting a couple rows ahead of me is staring at me.  At first I think he could just be staring out the window, but I wait a while, and he continues to stare at me.  This continues 'till it's time to switch trolleys.  



I get off the trolley and stand on the curb waiting for the next one, and this guy comes up and stands right next to me.  Now, he's not scary.  He's about my age and at least 6 inches shorter than me, but still...following me is not cool.



When he asks me what I'm reading, I realize he's French.  He makes some crack about Toqueville probably being French.  Which, duh... The fact that he's French not surprisingly is makes him less creepy.  He ends up being a French Exchange student who lives in University Towers, and we have a nice, non-threatening conversation on the blue line until I get off from work.  I'm gonna assume that he saw me around school somewhere and recognized me.  Thus, the staring.



Anyway, I'm at work now, so I really should be doing something...but we've finished all of the closing tasks that can be finished before actually closing.  And Casya's talking to her boyfriend in the store, so that's that."

"event","So, we went to La Jolla for a bonfire tonight with the extra wood we had from camping last weekend.  The wood didn't last very long, but some random guy gave us pieces of wood that looked like they had been taken from the ruins of something dilapidated.  And then some other random guys gave us more wood when they left.  So that was fun.  We spent the night singing 'Candle in the Wind' at the top of our lungs and playing mash with a deck of cards.  It was a girl's night, since Kyle had to stay and do a project.  Even Carly came down from Oceanside, so that was cool.

I think I'm going to quit my job soon.  Although now isn't a good time, seeing as about half the employees working there just randomly quit or stopped showing up.  But the semester's over in about 6 weeks, so I've gotta quit sometime soon.  And then...back to Irvine.  

I might go to a Beach Boy's concert in Palmdale in June...but then again, that might not happen.  How cool would that be, though??  I'm gonna go see Eisley in a couple of weeks too, so that's always fun.

I really should be studying for history right now, but I've been ridiculously lax about studying this semester.  I've also, however, been very lucky.  Somehow I seem to have straight 'A's.  That can't last very long.

We had gone to the cheesecake factory, fitting six people in Kyle's very small car, with Nancie stretched out across all of us in the backseat, and we were listening to ""build me up buttercup"" when it happened.  Kyle was in the front, singing loudly and tapping out the beat on the steering wheel, and Max was in the front singing too.  Nancie was mock bickering with her sister, who was here for the weekend.  The other Kyle, who I was practically glued to, was grinning crazily, and I just all of a sudden was incredibly happy."

We would have gone in a larger group, but all of the other girls we hang out with went home for the weekend.  So we get all dressed up and get in the car around 10:30 to go to the club.  Which we never find.  We even went inside an Albertsons to ask if they knew where it was. 

So anyway, being all dressed up as we were, we decided that we should do something.  We got Kyle to drive Nancie, Melissa (her sister), Melissa (not her sister) and I to Denny's. (the other guys were all playing a riveting game of warcraft.)  And that was awesome. Denny's is one of the happiest places on earth.

Then we all decided that we'd like to hear about some 'stories' that Kyle vaguely referred to while eating.  Nancie warned us that we would be disturbed, but we wanted to hear them anyway.  So he told us.  And let's suffice to say that we were disturbed.  A lot.

So anyway, Nancie finally kicked us all out, and now I'm too hyper to sleep.  

It may have something to do with the fact that I have a research paper to write tomorrow for which I haven't even gotten information yet.  The sooner I go to bed, the sooner I get up and have to write, right?

So we take the trolley to old town and get cold stone.  Which was fantastic.  We miss the second to last trolley back to campus by about a minute and a half.  And then, Alyssa asks the cop patrolling the trolley station if he'll handcuff her.  And he does.  And then he calls her beautiful and starts making references to S&M.  Yeah, that was weird.

Then yesterday, we went to a barbecue for a friend of Heather's friend's birthday. (Yeah, we just went for the food).  I was half sitting on this table watching a very riveting game of beer pong when the table collapses.  The two girls who were actually sitting on the table fell flat on their asses.  I managed to stay on my feet, although I got beer all down my leg and soaking my shoe.  Because there were about four open beer cans on the table.  And now my shoe smells like beer.  Which is the most disgusting thing ever.

Then yesterday at about 1100, I all of a sudden got sick.  Which sucked.  So all day today I've been doing my loads of homework while going through about a ton of tissues.

So next Saturday, we're off to Hot Monkey Love Cafe to see them and 6 other bands perform.  They even have an open mic night every tuesday, so that would be fun too.  

Anyway, I'm now off to sleep for about 24 hours, seeing as how I haven't slept for more than 4 hours straight for about a week.  Adios!"

I also watched 'It's always sunny in Philadelphia'.  That show is great.  Disturbing, but great.

Anyway, hope you all are having a great holiday weekend."

"event","Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I had done certain things differently in my life.  Not that I regret anything I've done much.  I just wonder how much of an impact small decisions have.  Or even large decisions, I guess.  Like, I wonder where I would be today if I still lived in Indiana.  Would I be in Louisville with Allie?  Anyway, I guess it doesn't really matter.  It's just interesting.

Yesterday I played my first actual game of pool.  I wouldn't have been that bad, seeing as how most times I got the angle of the ball correct, if I hadn't scratched just about as many times as I got another ball to go in. 

I feel oddly self sufficient.  I never really believed that I could handle living on my own.  Even if now I'm not living completely on my own, I realize that I could.  It's surprisingly easy.  

If I ever take up smoking, I'm gonna get an awesome zippo lighter with a British flag on it.  I can imagine that flicking it open and closed could become a habit that would annoy most people.  

Hm...I feel rather contemplative.  I should go find Melissa and Heather and see if they want to watch 'Ghost World' with me.  (A/N: Second statement has absolutely nothing to do with the first)  But, seeing as how I'm socially inept, maybe I won't.  

It sounds like I'm in a bad mood, doesn't it?  I'm really not depressed, just...contemplative.  I really like that word."

"event","So, I woke up at about noon today, which was an awesome start. 

Then later, a whole bunch of guys from the 9th floor came down and systematically knocked on doors and introduced themselves to everyone.  One of their names was Mowgli.  I joke not.  To be honest, though, I think it was a nickname.  Because he really did look like Mowgli.

Anyway, I've realized, after opening the door to a few people who have knocked, that I don't use the peephole.  It's odd, and possibly even odder that I'm spending this much time contemplating it.  But anyway, if you use the peephole, it's less potentially dangerous.  If you don't, you get to be surprised.  I rather like being surprised to see whoever is on the other side of the door.  When I get my own apartment, I'm gonna cover up the peephole and never use it. (unless it's really late at night or I live in a bad neighborhood...)

Right now, I am incredibly starving.  And every place to get food here closes at 8.  And I can't leave campus 'cause I don't have a trolley pass quite yet.  Eh, oh well.  Moving on.

I'm incredibly happy to have internet access, but it won't let me go anywhere that requires signing in, except, oddly, for livejournal.  I can't get to any email account, even the one the school signed me up for.  This pisses me off.  

Well, that's all.  My life is boring."

Everyone else seemed to know other people already, or else they were just incredibly quick about making friends, and they all went off to the parties on 'Fraternity Row' last night.  

Ah!  I feel like such a loser.  I really need to make some friends here. (which, yes, would require me to actually leave my dorm room... we are actually having a floor meeting in a couple of hours, which is mandatory, so maybe I'll meet someone there.)

I really enjoyed spending so much time with you guys this week.  it really worked out that I was here, 'cause none of us had started college yet.  Well, I guess the next time I'll see you is Christmas, so until then, this'll have to do.  Which, for me, it actually  has been for the last year.

It really sucked, 'cause the day we left London was the day the Live8 concert was held there.  Meaning we got to watch them set up in Hyde Park all week, but then missed Coldplay, U2, Paul McCartney, Keane, STING, and so on and so forth.  So I'm now taping the Vh1 and MTV versions of it.

I tried to go see 'Howl's Moving Castle' this weekend, 'cause the paper said it came out on Friday, but the paper was wrong.  Then I thought about going to see 'Star Wars', 'cause my brother is here, but then we decided not to and simply made up a game which is a mix between tennis and volleyball (the tennis courts were occupied). 

Was a news reporter for CBS today in polisci, and got to ask hard-hitting questions.  In reality, one of the presidential candidates barely managed not to break out in tears, and so I was relatively nice.

I found out that another friend lives right by my house.  That makes three people in as many weeks.  Why do I find this out now, when the school year is almost over?  So I went to hang out with her with minion, and that was fun.

It's apparent that I still have no life.

Oh, and I'm sorry I forgot to tell Angie and Katie happy birthday the other day.  I did think of you, I just didn't get a chance to get on and update.  So, 'Happy Birthday!'  How are you enjoying adulthood so far?

And Martin Freeman is like a big teddy bear.  He's so adorable.  And the 'Serenity' trailer was on this particular reel, which made it even better. I really can't wait until that comes out.

I'm happy 'cause Andy sent me a whole bunch of awesome songs from Dr. Demento's TV soundtrack, including 'Poisoning Pidgeons in the Park', which, believe it or not, I didn't have a copy of before.

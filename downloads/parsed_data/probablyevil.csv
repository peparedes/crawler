"event","Adapted from the litany of beer (replaced beer with latin) from goats.com;

i must drink latin. latin is
the mind-killer latin is the
little death that brings total
obliteration i will face my
latin i will permit it to pass
over me and through me
and when it has gone past i
will turn the inner eye to
see its path when the latin
has gone there will be
nothing. only i will remain.


I've noticed that lately I'm thinking the exact same things over and over again. For instance the phrase, ""Do over!"" is something I'll think to myself when I drop something in the sink, or I remember why I'm taking Latin. Have you ever had a friend that told one story so well, that he just told it over and over again? These days I feel like I have an annoying friend in my head.

I think that I'm thinking ""Do over!"" for the same reason that I've been saying to my mom ""I didn't do it"" every time she tells me anything. It's like a place holder for things that have become tedious. My mom loves to complain to me about my dad, I used to humor her and then when she started yelling I'd have to say, ""I know he's like that, blah blah, but you just have to relax, he's not going to change."" I got sick of being the marriage counselor. Now I hear, ""I can't believe..."" ""Didn'tdoit"" or, ""He never gi..."" ""Didn'tdoit"" and the great thing is it works. She hears it and remembers the shit I used to have to say, and bitching never happens. But now <i>I'm</i> getting tired of hearing didn'tdoit, and I'm damn sure she is.

I think ""Do over!"" anytime I feel like I'm reaching into self pity mode, I remind myself that if I don't like what I'm doing (with the exception of Latin) I can drop it and do something else in the fall. It works, but I'm getting tired of hearing it.

Hopefully something less 'in my head' and more interesting next time."

Massive Attack is a good british band. I'm muy pissed that some southern rap act ""borrowed"" the entire song, the one that I'm listening to, ""Be Thankful"". Anyhow they gaffed the entire song, the beat and the chorus as the hook, put some crappy yea's and yo's over it, and renamed it ""Diaminz"". The goddam song is about keeping your head up even when you're poor, it's not about fucking bling.

Hi,
I've been reading your LJ for a while (initially cause I thought you had a really cool sn) and I enjoy it.

Sorry that's the extent of my vocab after a basicallly 12hr work-day (bleugh, this is Summer???).

It's interesting to read a guy's thought...I especially liked the post about the AIM convo with your (ex?)crush. 

Anyhoo, I'm not commenting because I have advice on what you should do. Except maybe don't be scared of romance. ha, like I can talk.

Just wanted to say hi...and you ARE a good writer.
~

I don't know who this is, it was anonymous, and it's not that Japanese kid that reads this. Thanks for reading I guess, I'm not entirely sure what to do with it, and I suppose it would be stupid to go back and privatize things. I just assumed that because only a few people knew who I am they'd be the only people interested. Summarily: freaky.

No apparently my body is now not only unable to function on a 12-7 sleep pattern, but I can now sleep for only five hours at a time. So how to I remedy the situation, I get up and watch cartoons, the freaky late night kind.

Tomorrow (today) is the first day of supervised work I'll have had in two weeks, I'm wondering if they even care.

The Lj looks different now, I still don't really like it, I thought about generator but it doesn't cover up the repeating background well. Maybe I'll just fuck with it at work, god knows no one will notice, unless they actually find a task that requires me to know something other than Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v, and maybe a little delete-space-enter action. Cap me in the dome hole.

I don't live in an antiquated town where every thought is calculated and influenced by fear, my life isn't drummed down into the dirt by isolation. But holy G-d am I bored. I just couldn't bring myself to think, ""c'mon it's not that bad, you could be wearing <i>knickers</i>.""

The other thing is they referred to the area as a 'valley'. Doesn't a valley have to be lower than its surroundings? Is my brain broken again?

An away message from a childhood friend. [Oh my lord, completely traumatized by the awfulness that was ""The Village.""  AVOID AT ALL COST.] She once reprimanded me, ""humanities classes are not useless, they teach you how to think about things, you can't get perspective from books."" That pissed me off so hard...

I completely disagree, it was very interesting. If given the opportunity I would watch it again but not for $10, I have to uphold my heritage.

After reading for a little bit I realized that Mr. Offner had showed us this junior year, the first year I really couldn't stand math. I think that I couldn't stand it because Mr. Offner was really good at finding cool things and stating that they were cool, but he wasn't good at much else. It was frustrating to see so much stuff and be beaten to death because I couldn't remember trig formulas. 

I then went here http://www.jimloy.com/math/math.htm (fun subdirecting, subdirectorying, subdirectorizing? the very hungry caterpillar), and just browsing the list of topics I realized the number of things that I've been exposed to and how shittily I've understood them. So now I have mission and a mantra, actually I'm just going to go through this page and try to re-figure everything out.

Related story. There was a kid in my LinAlg class at Cornell who was from somewhere in western mass and we got along alright, the problem was he was very James and Posa-ish except that he came from JoeMcNormalTown USA (as opposed to weston). He just out classed everyone, and as usual I assumed there was some reason other than genetics that made him so intelligent so I asked him about the history of his mathness. It turns out he'd been using mathematica to do his homework since middle school, he was just horrible at doing algebra but he was able to see solutions because he had seen them, or things like them, hundreds of times before. He always finished tests early and said he spent most of his time checking algebra. That sounded like me except that I was putting in serious study time and not really getting what I was going for. So T poos to you and your righteous study habits.

My favorite profile (of mine) ever, so far (to date?), yea;

it takes forever to realize you don't get something, and only a second to get it. the trick is you can't do the first one first.

Aaaaand itinerary. I got up around noon, pissed about, watched some tv, did a little comic checking, ate some breakfast, took a shower. At 3 my mom had me wash dishes but that only took about 30 minutes. I then commenced the sitting online in hopes that some of my phone-phobic peoples would be on and have something interesting to say or do. This continued until about 7:30 with intermittent drumming and tv watching, when EC was like ""lets do something,"" and I was like ""ok, things to do: tv/movie/hang/walk/shoot squirrels,"" and then she was like, ""hold on parents bitching,"" and I was like, ""k."" We kind of sparred in that manner until 8ish when I finally just went over there and picked her up. She then proceeded to tell me that she was responsible for picking up dinner for her family, and I was like wtf, I am not going to be bitchified by someone elses parents. But then we went meandering around Wellesley college on the way from stuff to the restaurant and it took a stupid long time b/c E is 'tarded. We got the food, I dropped 'it' off and went home. TV, food, internet, bed.

The moral of the story is I don't mind you doing shit that I personally dissaprove of, just don't tell me about it like you're expecting me to say ""cool.""

That was really just a side note, I'm not pissed or anything, it just kind of precipitates me calling you dumb in one way or another every five seconds.

Work tomorrow. Some stupid indian food for lunch, I'm sure it's going to underwhelm me especially since Gfree has been gushing over it all flippin week. This will be only the third day of supervised work I've had, my boss is a lazy vacation taking biznootch. I'm up $695 so far, I need ideas for shit to do with it, if you're not gonna let me give it away.

I feel some kick-ass writing stirring in me but I haven't done anything, or watched anything cool lately. T you make me jealous."

1.1  Women want men to pretend occasionally. The problem is men don't like to lie, and pretending smacks of lying. Guys really like to lie, so much so that they can't really pretend without lying.

1.2  Until we redefine gender roles the book ""Men are from Mars Women are from Venus"" needs to be banned like weed.

1.3  People need to learn to distinguish between emotional and sexual attraction, tension etc. occasionally without getting all bent out of shape that a segregation thereof is implied.

1.4  I like controlling the mental (philosophical, logical, being the one who resolves shit and understands what's going on) space of any (really any) relationship more than actually liking someone, I've realized that I can't, in good faith, like someone who doesn't buck that control on a regular basis, and not just by being a bitch.

1.5  The person you want to marry is the person you will eventually raise, the person you actually marry is the person you should become. [edit: become is a cool word]

1.6  Gender roles are all about empowerment and need to be fucked with to avoid stupid justifications of valid opinions.

1.7  People who make relationship decisions while drunk give me the right to tell them how they think.

1.8  People that don't accept my analysis of them are in the minority and usually are more unhappy than the ones that do.

aaaaaaand background:

I was on the train this morning with Vanessa and Rick, they were babbling some bullshit about playing poker and Huttard's new gf. 'Nessa said she was weird, Rick said how, she said she wears scrunchies, and explanation of the history of scrunchies and their proper usage ensued. The gist of all this was you have to be in some way odd to wear scrunchies, at which point 'ness said, ""Like [your name] wears scrunchies, she's kind of, y'know, sheltered,"" to which I immediately administered a WTF. So I ask, did I jump the gun? Do you consider yourself worldly wise or whatever? I've never seen you wear a scrunchie but that's beside the point, I'm just not sure that I have a good sense of Anna, so to speak.

This is the kind of dumbshit I've given over to thinking about. Back to 'work' for me.

On the topic, I'm 19. This is a fact that I sometimes forget. It's usually lost amongst the 9/10ths penguins of which my brain is composed. Other things that I lose along with it are knowledge of what I look like, how strong (weak) I am, how tall I am, and my socio-economic status. I basically forget myself, to put it in words that some 18th century bureaucrat might use to put a pauper in his place. What routinely supplants this sense of self is kind of a hole, or a weird drawing (magnetism?), a desire jump people. I can't decide whether I'm oversexed or undersexed, or one because of the other. In any case the concept has begun to routinely manifest itself in an angry double-breasted gangster suit like fashion, crack its knuckles, and then beat the living shit out of me.

After that I'm assuming she got up to do something and got preoccupied because it was the last message. History of this girl;

I went to a soccer camp in North Andover for three years. It was at the Brooks school which was quite nice. But it was guys and girls training in separate areas and living in separate areas.There was interaction at 5 in the morning during aerobic training in a thawed hockey rink with turf [lots of jumping around in old t-shirts and sports bras], after hours [videos of euro leauges, a little socializing but mostly mosquito swatting], and during meals [checking people out time]. This was a short-term low-risk situation. I suck at hitting on girls, I don't need to hit on guys. I decided I was going to try something, just for the experience/practice. So I'm looking, big smile, nice... everything, definitely outgoing, I'll try this one. ""Hi I'm Dave..."" we ate lunch, actually we kind of pigged out but that was normal, and both went back to dorms to sleep b/c that's how the schedule went. Later after the movies there was some loitering, not getting back to the dorms, and I get tapped on the arm, I turn around and goOoOoOoing! That's the sound for what my eyes did. She's basically gorgeous, the soccer getup didn't really frame the picture right, I was literally babbling.

I'm going to skip to the most moronic parts.

She had an ingrown toenail and I followed her to the trainer just to talk after the next lunch (dude I whip myself).

There was a pool behind the gym where most people cooled off before sleeping after lunch, I'd never seen her there so I suggested, somewhat repetitively that it was really nice. When she showed up I couldn't get out of the water. She was wearing nylon shorts though and it was soooooo hard to not ask why. Hufflebbbbtttthhhhh... woo.

I got phone numbers, number<i>S</i>, and I called. I still haven't the fuckingest clue why she gave them to me. This is two summers ago now. I saw her when we went on that music trip to New York after NBC. It was a very different environment and the proximity of Westonites to her, and NY in general kind of made me nervous, to top it off we went for lunch and even though I purposely ordered tuna, she was doing that foot thing under the table. After that I called her probably 5 more times, then we mainly just talked on AIM. This was her senior year and Cornell was a royal ass pain so we haven't spoken for a while. I don't know how to take her invitation, I don't even know if half of the things that I'm thinking are because I want to think them, but I'm seriously tempted despite the fact that it would involve planning in terms of travel and lodging, and by way of that <i>what to do while I was there</i> because she's from there and I'm kind of past sight seeing. I'm really good at innuendo and masturbation jokes but actually broaching the subject of wanting to see someone for... romantic??? reasons scares the holy fucking moses out of me. Fuck I can't even do friendly hugs without tensing up.

Add to the awkwardness a little racial tension."

I thought it needed to be made, just so we could look back and say that we're not ignorant, but M M should seriously think about getting someone to narrate for him, he's like that obnoxious ""I told you so"" bitch, even though he's right. He's annoying in the same way as Bill O'Reily.

Anyhow my frustration is with this charge to 'do something'. I've concluded that the reason I haven't found anything to do is that there is nothing to do, and don't you fucking contradict me before I finish. The reason that there is nothing to do is that I do not enjoy solitary activities. <i>I like people</i>, fucking get that through your head (that sounds really funny). Honestly though, I just get happier when I'm not alone, it doesn't matter if we do anything I can just sit around the house with a friend and be happy, that's all I need, and I'm fucking sick of needing excuses to do that.

My intrinsically psychoanalytic side says that I have this need b/c I come from an extremely small family, mom, dad, sister, aunt, uncle, two cousins, one living grandmother, that's it. You can fit us in a suburban. ""What about extended family?"" you might ask. <i>They don't fucking exist.</i> My father's sister never had kids and my uncle's brother is married without kids but doesn't keep in touch. And as for siblings of grandparents? They died back in New York in the fucking 20's.

So pardon me for being a needy friend, but my father is a shlub and my mother is an invalid. She can't fucking walk and her pain meds give her memory loss, <i>that is</i> an invalid. And I don't care how well she looks, that's the same bullshit that had her lying for days in the hospital without a nurse coming to see her."

That fucking pisses me off. If you're going to be my friend and talk like that you better fucking be ugly.

"event","Noose Gnus News. Apparently some gazelle like creatures made the front page by hanging themselves. Could I possibly get a PhD in random bullshit? Oh right, Sociology.

Anyway, this is the first post in a while, not that you care. I've been home, around, saw like seven people, three '03ers and four '04ers, haven't been having tremendous amounts of fun. Went to eastbumstick MA today with mom to see about getting the floor in the Bug 'Em replaced so the seats don't fall out while I'm out cruising the strip with my Ghetto fabulous friends this summer. I'm just kidding... there is no strip. I think I get funnier when I'm sad.

At the risk of letting my sister and parents know something I don't want them to know; I'm getting lonely. I still maintain that love doesn't actually exist in the romantic sense, that it is just a combination of matching personalities and sexual attraction. The fucked up bit is that tight chested feeling, with the sighing, I get that randomly now. And I don't mean for random people, I mean like with regard to road signs and food and carpet lines and really anything. I find it mainly to be an issue because I no longer have that feeling as compass for who and who not to love, leaving my rationale in the hands of the apple tree limb, the divining rod', the fickle finger if you'll indulge the analogy-randy-amalgam of my nuts and marbles.

Ah, that's better. I just put a hat over my desk lamp so now I can see my screen without a Jimi Hendrix music video superimposed on my retinas. Foo Fighters are really good, I mean seriously, there's no emotional content but I can't think about anything else when it's on...

Yah so, I am sinkeeink zat zee fisioligical reasoning for zees cccchorniness zat I am feelink ess bas-ed in zee laque of sessual activities partaken by meesself. But I just changed my sheets yesterday so that's kind of out. Zen zee cause moost lie in psychosis of my developmental years. Faeck this accent I can't do it right. Lets recap: Wanted to marry my mother when I was 6, maybe I didn't understand marriage or maybe Freud was right, argue amongst yourselves. Wore gigantic t-shirts in elementary school b/c I was embarrassed of erections, I realized wearing whities everyday for 9 years would do that so now I rotate, shirts are normal. Middle school, new town, oblivious, still a kid, slow dancing is dumb and no one fast dances, several girls won't leave me alone and I don't get it. My sexual identity crisis is allayed because a group of roughly 20 assholes decide they're going to have it for me. Cheryl G asks me out, after I tell her that I'm not going to go out with her and I know she's going to ask me, I don't go out with her. Cathy S asks me out, she laughs way to much and cannot carry on a conversation, I don't do it. I refuse to take Madeline A to a hockey game repeatedly because my MOTHER is scaring the fuck out of me by telling me she likes me. Finally give up and participate in truth or dare in Christine B's basement, have to kiss Madeline, I make a scene, she kisses me with tongue, I say gross, she runs upstairs crying. Umm, I think Maiah had crush on me at one point but that was just physically impossible, not to mention I didn't know it at the time. Yea moving on. Hall moves in, we're friends, her parents divorce, I spend poop-loads of time talking to her about it, I realize I like her, I tell her, I get told 'maybe in highschool'. Crush persists, I don't tell anyone ever. She goes out with G Lee, G Sanzone, D Wrangham and M Sandroff, I completely avoid her b/c I don't want to look like a stalker. I have numerous fucked up memories of watching her drunk at cast parties and consorting with people I wanted to kill since before she even moved in. She leaves, I get over it... I think. My theory is the memory of a crush makes it last regardless of actual feelings, and that's my explanation. Stage two is convincing myself I like other people... none work, some are cute others are just there. Maggie at Cornell, some girl from the AMA tour from Virginia, just bullshit, never did anything. Yesterday my sister was yelling at me for never having a girlfriend, that shouldn't bother me based on my personal philosophy but I guess I just don't like being made fun of.

While I'm at Swarthmore I think I may join the Society of Friends, they don't believe in sex before marriage and I'll get draft immunity on the basis of my religion."

We just went over to his room, to work on the homework and I tried to get her to sit next to him on the bed but she's just a wimp. Neither of them are the type to make a move, this is pissing me off."

"event","I'm sitting here, trembling. Gloming peanut butter at fuck 'o clock in the morning. Wondering why I'm up so late when I manage my time so well. Complementing myself on my time management skills, wondering if I really make more time, or if I just don't ever do anything. If you eat enough peanut butter it starts to taste like chocolate.

You've been thinking about writing a movie, guess what. Whenever you start to see something, you also start to lose it, I try not to think and everything comes in pictures, all stylized like a black and white movie that you remember in color because your brain was filling them in as you went. In high school I felt invincible. I knew what I didn't want and got what I did and I had things that only I did, and I was good at them, in my mind. Now I just feel as if I've lost all sense of me, I can't play the drums anymore, I can't sing and I've lost the venue to prove myself wrong. I feel empty. My body is still weak, responds harshly to everything, sleep deprivation, hunger, nyquil, stress, grease and thinking. Sometimes I think the world I create in my head is great, it's beautiful as a story that I can remember even though none of it is enjoyable in the moment. Sometimes I feel as if it's ok to be irritated because there's something poetic about knowing you're right and not telling anyone. Mmm, peanut butter.

I've never made a decision, not in my whole life, everything that I've called a decision is really a finagle to keep my options open. As a result I can't do anything, I hear music that I can't record and can't play, I see people that I want to break and I can't, I never developed the neccesary skills, I was too busy thinking. And thinking has only lead me to the conclusion that thinking in and of itself is useless unless a conclusion can be drawn and actions be changed. So far everything is a line and I don't even know which way it's moving in relation to me because it's just plain black. I want to write a hit play and seduce an older woman and piss off my hero. But tomorrow I go to talk to my dean about what to do about my lack of motivation, what exactly I'm paying the National Society of Collegiate Scholars for, and what in the crap their name means to my ability to be happy in life. I'm just shaking, shaking shaking.

In 5th grade everything was self evident, the big challenge in my life was the fraction final in J.W.'s class and my nemesis was Frank Krehmendahl. He'd been an antagonist since I'd been going to school, he was one of those kids that was too smart to give a shit, he'd been spending afternoons with J.W. since second grade, but I didn't notice this because I was too busy feeling superior because I was the only one in my class that could concentrae without taking rittalin. Frank and I got the same score on the final, but I knew that it didn't mean anything. I so want everything to be self apparent, I don't want to have to stop thinking to learn these things. I have the ideas and the motivation, what I used to feel was the thread of a calling, some genius, but I don't have the tools to express it all I can do is bitch. Glory fades."

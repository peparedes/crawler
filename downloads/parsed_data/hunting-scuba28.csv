"event","I am so sick of the whole school experience. I am ready for the summer to come, more than anyone could realize. 
I am annoyed by people because I just do not get them. How can one say that he/she cares about another, but when a problem arises that ""caring"" person can not even look at the other.
I am hurting, and no one seems to realize this because they are so wrapped up in their lives, which im ok with, or they just think that I am so wrong that I do not even deserve the help, which im not ok with."

"event","Well, my weekend has not been the suckfest I expected. My mom and I had our big fight before we left for Biloxi, so she perked up. The casino was really packed, and the food was not up to its normal standards, but it was still ok. The room was great, but the beds lacked...everything! They hurt really bad and felt like the floor. But, the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub and you could watch tv in it, so i did after I went to the amazing workout room. I went there a couple of times and made the mistake of watching a hunting show on the treadmill, so my legs hurt pretty bad. My mom and I talked the whole way down there and back. Somehow, it was a great, deep conversation that I wished had never stopped. My aunt met us in Biloxi and stayed te night with us. It was great. We all decided it was our escape from men weekend, which I welcomed. I love when all have our girl talks, which we need to do soon! Maybe next Friday can be girls' night, we will see.
In academic news, Dr. Clay let me change my paper topic, so it will now be on Diabetes. I can explain why later, but i don't feel like typing it right now. My paper for government will be a breeze. I found a website about the government structure of the Wizarding World, from Harry Potter. It gives me a perfect outline for the paper. Now, I have to start working on all of this crapload, so I will be free this weekend to go hunting. Yes my friends, it reopens this weekend for another week and a half!! 
Hope some of you had fun planting trees...hehe, I'm too sick to go!"

"event","so far, all of my family has done really well dealing with our loss. its hard to tell anyone why this is such a big deal because its a long story, thats very confusing to ppl that do not know my history with my family, which is something i am not willing to discuss. period. im sorry, i mean im really close to u guys, but not that close yet. but i think all of you guys are bright spots for me. when we start talking about the funeral arrangements and such i think of you, and i cheer up just a little. at this point, its hard to let go. the funeral will not be until thursday at 11, so maybe that will bring some closure. i can not believe that for the rest of my life, i will never get a phone call from my aunt again. i just wish this was an extremely bad dream that i will wake up from. but, for her sake, i am glad that she has passed so i can not be selfish and wish this was not true.
 i am very hopeful that next year will be better. and, this experience has brought me a lot closer to my faith which i have strayed from for too many years. im glad u guys have had a great christmas break, so far, and hope the best for you."

"event","hi again from the deep depths of hell.
it is so strange how life happens. my aunt's favorite day has always been christmas. i dont understand how such a great god could take her away two days before christmas. i feel kinda selfish right now, because i am mourning her, which i know is wrong because she is better off away from her pain that her life has become in the last few years. somehow, she has always looked past herself and taken care of everyone else. it just does not feel like christmas. there is no reason to cry when you open presents on christmas morning. this just isnt fair. all the packages were addressed from her and my uncle because she was alive, and she thought she would keep living for a long time. i have really never dealt with this kinda pain before, because the last relative i lost was when i was in 3rd grade, which means i had no idea what was really happening. now, i am old enough to understand i will not see aunt gloria again, and it hurts so bad. i went from being on top of the world and completely ecstatic, to feeling aboslutely devestated with one sentencein a phone call. at least my dad and everyone have dealt with this before, two of my uncles passed away years ago, and they had to deal with that loss. luckily, i have had a very comfortable life. i guess we are going to the funeral home tomorrow to pick everything out, and my uncle and i are going to go through the boxes of pictures he has to find some for the service.i think im gonna give my aunt her christmas present anyway. i just wish that i could get to the point there are no more tears to be shead."

 these were some conversations that i couldnt resist putting on lj. i had a really good post, but moo moo decided she wanted to ""help aunt brooke type"", so, yeah, its gone. she stayed here from two yesterday to 4 today. it was so flippin awesome! but between the weiner shishkabobed on townley's car to noodle fighting, melting plastic bottles in the fire, eating contests with nic and townley, gettin high somehow by the fire, hiding from ali, climbing on the roof, and the halarious convos i think my party was pretty much a hit.

elena and erica- u two missed some of the funniest talks EVER!! u girls shoulda stayed. i really think the melting plastic and marshmallows REALLY screwed with our heads. im not gonna post what all was said, theres jsut some things u cant write on lj.

ashley- im sorry that u had leave really early, but im glad that u made part of it. and thanx for ridin with me to pick up the baby. she stayed all nite!! this was a huge deal if u cant tell.

 i know my family is relying on me to make a difference in the world, and i want to do it, but i just feel like everything i do should be better. i always thought i was a great student, but i dont have any noominations for anything because i didnt stay at Niceville where i could have succeeded, and at least graduate with high honors. im just one of the crowd, not really a shining star like i want to be, and it bugs me.
 probably the other thing that bothers me is being single. it was ok for a while, but now its getting to my birthday and prom will be here soon. i really want a date for my birthday, or at least some one to take me to prom. ive had some boyfriends and various other types of friends, but i have always been single at every dance and for my senior prom i just feel its unacceptable. i really really really want a date, not one of those ""oh i feel so bad for u"" ones, but an actual date.

i wish i could say that i have had a wonderful weekend full of excitement and fun since ive had no homework. but of course not. my life does not work to my advantage. so far, i have been sick all weekend and have had to endure many grueling hours of what things will be like after i die. 
friday. we had a good talk on the deck about something, but at this point snot is clogging up my brain so i cannot remember what was said. i got home, my mom walked in the door right after me and proceeded to tell me my list of crap to do for the weekend. then, she fell asleep, which sucked because she snores louder than niagra falls and jeopardy was on, and i couldnt change the channel or shed wake up and cuss me out until i turned back to that wretched show. so i called my sister. she came over, which sucked because i had such a fever i did not even want to play with moo moo. yeah, it was that bad. so i tried not to complain, and hoped that i would get over it. well, my mom came up with the bright idea of going out to dinner with the WHOLE FAMILY!!! did u know, i cant kill yourself with the butterknives at Ali Baba's in fwb?! i found out after sitting there for like 1.5 hours with all of the freaks that some consider my relatives. my mom was a pig the whole way back from fwb and tried to get pissed at me for not doing anything around the house for weeks which is complete bs. well, we got home, my sister left with her screaming kid, and i got online when my aunt from louisiana imed me and asked if they could come over. yuck. her and my uncle bothering me why im sick, and my mom in a crappy mood. just what i need.
saturday.took the sat. i could barely see the paper becuase my eyes were watering so bad and i sniffled the whole time. that was the worst morning. but i barely realized how long it took because i was so out of it. got home, my dad was here and had already got into a fight with my mom before i had got home. that sucked. my mom thought it was funny, and my got madder, so my mom laughed more, and it went on. so i left to go run some errands for my mom. the phone call with ali helped. i was able to at least not flip out because at that point i was pissed. got back home and my aunt and uncle walked in the door not too long after i had popped more pills and layed down for a nap. my aunt wanted to go shopping, so my mom begged me to go cuz she hates shopping and gets annoyed wit my aunt. i hate shopping neways, it was worse sick. but i got a bunch of stuff, im talkin a whole bunch!but i still didnt get a freakin jean jacket. grrr. so we got back and went to eat with my dad, which was even worse than when i got home earlier. but the food was good. i went to bed early again. 
today. even sicker. my brother and dad was here today. mom and aunt left to go shopping, but i couldnt be bribed with 50 bucks to leave the air conditioning today. i hate fevers especially when there is an 18 month old running around tearing stuff up who is also sick. its just me n my uncle for now, and we're competing for who gets the tv. but of course, nothing is on. ok, im signing off. time for more tylenol to get my fever down. ttyl!"

You rank up there with your seduction skills, though you might not know it.
That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power!
The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism.

You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world.
Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.
You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you?

You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

"event","im finally updating. this is gonna b one of those emo things, that im sure u dont wanna read, i just wanna vent.
i am so sick of my life. it seems like all i do anymore is go to school, come home, do homework, eat, do more homework, go to bed, get up, go to school, and repeat. when i do ge away from the cycle, i get bitched at by my mom because somehow, i had fun and left my responsibilites behind, oh f$#%ing darn. i am so sick of her already, and she has only been home a couple of days. i liked her better before she left because she was nice since she felt guilty about going off and leaving me at home, she does it everytime. if my brother wasnt her in niceville, i doubt she woulda come home, though
my dad doesnt help. all he cares about is how to get my mom back. he is obsessed with her and bella. he could care less from there, you have no idea.
everything just sux anymore. nothing seems to workout, no matter what i try. i keep thinkin that i am on top of my work, and then i get a whole bunch piled on top of me. i just dont know where else to begin explaining. i am sorry everyone, there is a lot more i dont want ya'll to know. as long as i can keep everything else to myself, then i would prefer to keep it that way. i am so bad about keeping this barrier between the world and me, i dont think i have ever let anyone inside that wall. im not trying to be mean or dont trust u guys or something, i am just so bad about keeping things in until it is critical to let it out of my system.i guess im too laid back to let things bother me, instead they just sit in the back of my head and stew. i know im not making any sense, but thats ok, this has really helped. c everyone lateron!"

On my way to skool today i knew it would be a great day, and i was completely right. It has just turned out so good. Classes were easy, i was let out of Ms. Polk's and Dr. Jay's classes early, and school was just fun all together. i know that was completely crazy, but its true, dont get the straightjacket out. Senior Superlatives made the day even better.
Tonite. It was so cool. I had a lot of fun, especially for that one hour. Mark, Brittani, thanx. i really enjoyed that, yall know what i mean. the movie was really good, too. i thought it would be worse but it couldnt be. brittan is a little different than us, but i think i need to get to know him a little more to see if i like him or not. im sure thats not the opinion u wanted ali, but thats all ive got for now. the beach was fun, except for the dead fish. i really coulda done without that. i cant wait to take my dad back to buy the perfume from abrcrombie, i really liked it. it still smells good. im so tired, im gonna go to bed. c yall 2morrow. call me if u need a ride. byes!"

"event","well, i came back from an amazingly good weekend to elections, fightin, gas asses, and tons of stress through the horrendous form of PAPERS. 
of course i was late to skool today also, becuz of the damn gas thing. i was surrounded by assholes that took 45 min at the pumps, and it was only 2 cars!
im not even goin to get into the fight, it would hurt everyone's feelings if i said what i feel. 
not only was there fightin at skool, but when i got home i got into it wit my mom. she was first mad becuz i ate lunch wit my sister and moo moo w/out her. and now she just got mad at me again. i didnt let her talk to my cousin, which woulda had no purpose. also, she hates me goin to see my grandaddy and granny, like ud never believe. so she was mad when i wanted to go visit them. and of course when i got there my granny was mad becuz i forgot to remind my dad of somethin so she yelled at me. i wish my dad would take his balls from the jar that my mom obviously carries with her, and get me out of this house. i cant do it without some backin from him. i am strong, but not that strong. i have a heart that my mom can manipulate so well.i have lost all my respect for my dad becuz he cant face my mom even if its for my own good.
the elections, what can i say, i was ready to do the job, i really wanted it, and i am really upset about this whole ordeal. my whole life i have been second best at everything. truely. no matter how hard i try i am always second. in softball we had a perfect season year b4 last until the last game, it was the only other undefeated team that we played, and i lost the game for us. it has always happened like that.
i have soo much homework its not even cool. the papers just keep pourin into my brain like rain in a puddle.i think i have too many classes.
my weekend just keeps cheerin me up. i saw a good movie, went to the beach, went flounderin, went to the art show, ate flounder wit moo moo and the rest of the family, swam at vrotex and actually enjoyed the car ride wit vince and mark (somewhat), saw fireworks, went on a pontoon boat wit ali to crab island, and watched miami LOOSE to fsu 10-7.
i kw this is completely narsistic but i had to get this off my chest."

"event","this weekend has been exasperating. My mom has driven me completely, totally, and absolutely nuts. we went and bought new lattice work for the backporch yesterday. it sucked. my brother came with his kid and my mom was obnoxious and grouchy the whole time, just like she's been today. luckily, my dad took me out to eat last nite to a chinese place in destin, behind chilis;they have excellent crab legs, and we went to wal-mart. it was nice because i havent had much time with my dad lately between me goin back to skool and him havin an unbelievable amount of work.
today, my ""mother"" dragged around about doin laundry so we didnt leave for the laundrymat until 1:00!! adn no, we arent that big of rednecks that we dont own a washer and dryer, our washer has kicked the dust and my mom is too flippin lazy to buy a new one.now the whole day has been wasted because she wouldnt get up and get dressed this morning. i cant stand when she gets in these moods!
in other news, i got my fcat science scores back today. i did so good! i scored a 417 out of 500, so i got a certificate like i did for the readin portion in 10th grade. i am the shiznit.
the party was too much fun. im glad no one hit each other tryin to get out. i think my pool will never be the same, though."

"event","we have only had classes for a week and im already worried about my homework! plus, this is only wow week. i am really scared about chem 2 this semester. i might change it to biology because i might use biology for my major since it is a good idea for med school, just like chemistry is. i dont know, heck, i dont even know what my capstone project is going to be.
on tuesday if everyone wants to come over and have some sandwiches and chips and stuff instead of haing pizza at skool you guys are welcome to. just let me know if u think it is a good idea.
the party was more than fun, it was awesome. i hope i did not offend vince when i told him he was the worst driver in the group. I keep forgetting i need to watch what i say to him because i think he is a lot more sensitive than what he lets on. i wonder what is up with him, somethin has been wrong since the beginning of the week. i felt bad for elena when vince tackled her; he has the same problem as me sometimes. we dont realize how strong we are. never the less, the football game was fun. i think that dang tree caught the ball more than us, though.
jake really fit in good last nite. it is really surprising to think that he isnt graduating with us this year. theis, dont think itll be a problem to him with us anytime.
im really glad mike came last nite, he reall wants to be included with anyone he can. I bet it sux when ur girlfriend, ur only close friend, leaves right before ur senoir year. we all need to work on helping him feel included. if he hangs with us great, if he doesnt, at least we tried. as nice as all of u were when i wanted to be around u guys, i just wanna pay that back.
we must have been on some good drugs last nite to make us action ourselves off for a football game and rent ""shrek 2"", cough cough. the movie was halarious and very emotionally scarring. the green fairy sceen was very very very off the handle.i cant wait to see everyone monday!"

my classes with mr weatherford are completely boring. im glad jamie, towns, and alex are there to entertain me. i think i would loose my sanity otherwise. i must have; to actually let jamie drive my truck, but i was really not in the mood to drive. when erica suggested to let him drive, i really didnt care. i am just so sick of having to drive because its all afternoon everyday with some errand for somebody and its just nawing at me.
my mom bought me stuff today! we went to the ortho dentist today, which he said not to come back, i graduated from the brace doctor!!neways, we went and bought about $130 of stuff from old navy and sears!!!!!!!! icouldnt believe she did that. but then she complained that my dad has to help pay for it even though he spent that much when me n him went last time. i cant believe how crazy my mom is over money. it really annoys me."

The way i figure, screw jake! he doesnt know what hes missing out on!im not gonna forget him, just move past him."
